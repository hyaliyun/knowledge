The Lion of Babylon has remained a prominent symbol of Iraqi culture, a type of Iraqi battle tank was named after it. Reconstructed full-scale replica of the ancient city of Babylon in Iraq. Iraqi nationalism is a form of nationalism which asserts the belief that Iraqis are a nation and promotes the cultural unity of Iraqis, of all ethnoreligious groups; Arabs, Kurds, Turkmens, Assyrians, Yazidis, Mandeans, Shabaks, Kawliya, Dom, Yarsans, and others. Iraqi nationalism involves the recognition of an Iraqi identity stemming from ancient Mesopotamia including its civilizations of Sumer, Akkad, Babylonia and Assyria.Reich, Bernard. Political leaders of the contemporary Middle East and North Africa: A Bibliographical Dictionary. Westport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Press, Ltd, 1990. Pp. 245. Iraqi nationalism influenced Iraq's movement for independence from Ottoman and British occupation. Iraqi nationalism was an important factor in the 1920 Revolution against British occupation, and the 1958 Revolution against the British-installed Hashemite monarchy.Bengio, Ofra. Saddam's Word: Political Discourse in Iraq. New York, New York, USA: Oxford University Press, 1998. Pp. 117-118. There are two prominent variants. One variant views an Iraqi nation as one which involves Arab, Turkmen, Assyrian and Kurdish people, all of whom have a common Mesopotamian heritage; this view was promoted by Abd al-Karim Qasim, who was of mixed Arab-Kurdish descent.By Kerim Yildiz, Georgina Fryer, Kurdish Human Rights Project. The Kurds: culture and language rights. Kurdish Human Rights Project, 2004. Pp. 58 The second variant is a dual nationalism which combines Iraqi nationalism and Arab nationalism, a much broader form of ethnic nationalism which supports Iraqi nationalism and links it to matters that impact Arabs as a whole.Orit Bashkin. The other Iraq: pluralism and culture in Hashemite Iraq. Stanford, California, USA: Stanford University Press, 2009. Pp. 174. Saddam Hussein believed that the recognition of the ancient Mesopotamian origins and heritage of Iraqi Arabs was complementary to supporting Arab nationalism. The Ba'athist regime officially included the historic Kurdish Muslim leader Saladin as a patriotic symbol in Iraq, Saladin led Muslim and Arab forces during the Crusades.Kiernan, Ben. Blood and Soil: A World History of Genocide and Extermination from Sparta to Darfur. Yale University Press, 2007. Pp. 587. Iraqi nationalist identity and culture Abd al-Karim Qasim Iraqi nationalism has emphasized Iraq's cultural heritage which dates back to ancient Sumer, Akkad, Babylonia and Assyria, states that are considered the cradle of civilization that spread civilization to other parts of the world. The Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar II and Kurdish Muslim leader(sudam) Saladin during the Crusades are two important historical figures of Iraq and iconic figures in Iraqi nationalism. The concept of contemporary Iraqi national identity may have originated with the rebellion and subsequent British siege of Najaf in 1918 during World War I, but this is disputed. By the 1930s advocacy of the concept of an Iraqi territorial identity arose amongst the Iraqi intellectual field and Iraqi identity grew in importance after World War II.Orit Bashkin. The other Iraq: pluralism and culture in Hashemite Iraq. Stanford, California, USA: Stanford University Press, 2009. Pp. 128. Though Iraqi nationalism and Arab nationalism are technically separate from each other, both nationalisms influenced each other - adopting each other's metaphors and narratives. In some cases Iraqi nationalism has been advocated as a necessary supplement to Arab nationalism such as the Iraqi political newspaper Al-Hatif advocating Iraqi nationalism on issues of domestic Iraqi culture, and advocating Arab nationalism on issues of broader Arab culture. During the Hashimite monarchy period in Iraq, it was commonplace for writers to write of an Iraqi identity separate from an Arab framework, Iraq's print media and education at the time emphasized Iraq's landscape, its tribes, and its unique poetry and literature. Beginning in the 1930s, Iraqi historians began to address the Iraq revolt of 1920 by Iraqis against the British as a formative moment in Iraqi history that Iraqi historians referred to as \\"the Great Iraqi Revolution\\". Prominent early Iraqi nationalist figures were the intellectuals 'Abd al-Razzaq al-Hasani and 'Abbas 'Azzawi.Orit Bashkin. The other Iraq: pluralism and culture in Hashemite Iraq. Stanford, California, USA: Stanford University Press, 2009. Pp. 129. Al-Hasani was strongly critical of the British Mandate of Mesopotamia, published his first volume of his work The History of Iraqi Governments in the 1930s (the second published in the 1950s), the first volume was endorsed by King Faisal I of Iraq. Al-Hasani was a prominent proponent of Iraqi nationalism. In one of his works al-Hasani included a letter by Faisal I, the letter had Faisal I describing Iraq as suffering from religious and sectarian tensions due to Iraqis being unable to form a common nationalism.Orit Bashkin. The other Iraq: pluralism and culture in Hashemite Iraq. Stanford, California, USA: Stanford University Press, 2009. Pp. 130. Faisal I described Iraq as being governed by a literate Sunni elite over illiterate and ignorant Shi'ite and Kurdish sects who opposed the central government. 'Azzawi wrote Iraq between Two Occupations - referring to the Turkish and British rule, that received acclaim by the Iraqi government that assisted him in publishing his work. The works of both al-Hasani and 'Azzawi were highly popular from 1935 to 1965, with many of their works being published in second and third editions and both authors' works influenced Iraqi nationalism.Orit Bashkin. The other Iraq: pluralism and culture in Hashemite Iraq. Stanford, California, USA: Stanford University Press, 2009. Pp. 130-131. Abd al-Karim Qasim promoted a civic nationalism in Iraq that recognized Iraq's Arabs and Kurds as equal partners in the state of Iraq, Kurdish language was not only formally legally permitted in Iraq under the Qassim government, but the Kurdish version of the Arabic alphabet was adopted for use by the Iraqi state and the Kurdish language became the medium of instruction in all educational institutions, both in the Kurdish territories and in the rest of Iraq. Under Qassim, Iraqi cultural identity based on Arabo-Kurdish fraternity was stressed over ethnic identity, Qassim's government sought to merge Kurdish nationalism into Iraqi nationalism and Iraqi culture, stating: \\"Iraq is not only an Arab state but an Arabo-Kurdish state...[T]he recognition of Kurdish nationalism by Arabs proves clearly that we are associated in the country, that we are Irakians first, Arabs and Kurds later\\".Denise Natali. The Kurds and the state: evolving national identity in Iraq, Turkey, and Iran. Syracuse, New York, USA: Syracuse University Press, 2005. Pp. 49. The Qassim government's pro-Kurdish policies including a statement promising \\"Kurdish national rights within Iraqi unity\\" and open attempts by Iraq to coopt Iranian Kurds to support unifying with Iraq resulted in Iran responding by declaring Iran's support for the unification of all Kurds who were residing in Iraq and Syria, into Iran.Roby Carol Barrett. \\"The greater Middle East and the Cold War: US foreign policy under Eisenhower and Kennedy\\", Library of international relations, Volume 30. I.B.Tauris, 2007. Pp. 90-91. Qassim's initial policies towards Kurds were very popular amongst Kurds across the Middle East whom in support of his policies called Qassim \\"the leader of the Arabs and the Kurds\\".Wadie Jwaideh. The Kurdish national movement: its origins and development. Syracuse, New York, USA: Syracuse University Press, 2006. Pp. 289. Kurdish leader Mustafa Barzani during his alliance with Qassim and upon Qassim granting him the right to return to Iraq from exile imposed by the former monarchy, declared support of the Kurdish people for being citizens of Iraq, saying in 1958 \\"On behalf of all my Kurdish brothers who have long struggled, once again I congratulate you [Qassim] and the Iraqi people, Kurds and Arabs, for the glorious Revolution putting an end to imperialism and the reactionary and corrupt monarchist gang\\".Mas ª≈´d BƒÅrzƒÅnƒ´, Ahmed Ferhadi. Mustafa Barzani and the Kurdish liberation movement (1931-1961). New York, New York, USA; Hampshire, England, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, 2003. Pp. 180-181. Barzani also commended Qassim for allowing Kurdish refugee diaspora to return to Iraq and declared his loyalty to Iraq, saying \\"Your Excellency, leader of the people: I take this opportunity to tender my sincere appreciation and that of my fellow Kurdish refugees in the Socialist countries for allowing us to return to our beloved homeland, and to join in the honor of defending the great cause of our people, the cause of defending the republic and its homeland.\\" Saddam Hussein and Iraqi Ba'athist ideologists sought to fuse a connection between ancient Babylonian and Assyrian civilization in Iraq to the Arab nationalism by claiming that the Bablyonians and ancient Assyrians are the ancestors of the Arabs.Tim Niblock. Iraq, the contemporary state. London, England, UK: Croom Helm, Ltd, 1982. Pp. 64. Thus, Saddam Hussein and his supporters claim that there is no conflict between Mesopotamian heritage and Arab nationalism. Saddam Hussein as President of Iraq expressed himself as an Iraqi in state art - associating himself as a modern-day Nebuchadnezzar II and wearing both Arabic and Kurdish headgear in such art. Saddam Hussein also paralleled himself and the Ba'athist government to Saladin, the famous Kurdish leader of Muslims and Arabs against Crusaders in Jerusalem, who was from modern day Iraq.Galaty, Michael L; Charles Watkinson, Charles. Archaeology under the dictatorship. New York, New York, USA: Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, 2004. Pp. 204.  Irredentism  Map of the Ottoman provinces of Mosul, Baghdad and Basra. (1900) After gaining independence in 1932, the Iraqi government immediately declared that Kuwait was rightfully a territory of Iraq, claiming it had been part of an Iraqi territory until being created by the British.Duiker, William J; Spielvogel, Jackson J. World History: From 1500. 5th edition. Belmont, California, USA: Thomson Wadsworth, 2007. Pp. 839. The Qassim government held an irredentist claim to Khuzestan.Helen Chapin Metz.

Manchester, England, UK: Manchester University Press, 2003 Pp. 209. Saddam Hussein's government sought to annex several territories. In the Iran-Iraq War, Saddam claimed that Iraq had the right to hold sovereignty to the east bank of the Shatt al-Arab river held by Iran.Erik Goldstein, Erik (Dr.). Wars and Peace Treaties: 1816 to 1991. P133. Iraq had officially agreed to a compromise to hold the border at the centre-line of the river in the 1975 Algiers Agreement in return for Iran to end its support for Kurdish rebels in Iraq.Erik Goldstein, Erik (Dr.). Wars and Peace Treaties: 1816 to 1991. P133. The overthrow of the Iranian monarchy and the rise of Ruhollah Khomeini to power in 1979 deteriorated Iran-Iraq relations and following ethnic clashes within Khuzestan and border clashes between Iranian and Iraqi forces, Iraq regarded the Algiers Agreement as nullified and abrogated it and a few days later Iraqi forces launched a full-scale invasion of Iran that resulted in the Iran-Iraq War.Erik Goldstein, Erik (Dr.). Wars and Peace Treaties: 1816 to 1991. P133. In addition, Saddam supported the Iraq-based Ahwaz Liberation Movement and their goal of breaking their claimed territory of Ahwaz away from Iran, in the belief that the movement would rouse Khuzestan's Arabs to support the Iraqi invasion.Kevin M. Woods, David D. Palkki, Mark E. Stout. The Saddam Tapes: The Inner Workings of a Tyrant's Regime, 1978-2001. Cambridge University Press, 2011. Pp. 131-132 In the Gulf War, Iraq occupied and annexed Kuwait before being expelled by an international military coalition that supported the restoration of Kuwait's sovereignty. After annexing Kuwait, Iraqi forces amassed on the border with Saudi Arabia, with foreign intelligence services suspected that Saddam was preparing for an invasion of Saudi Arabia to capture or attack its oil fields that were a very short distance from the border.Nathan E. Busch. No End in Sight: The Continuing Menace of Nuclear Proliferation. Lexington, Kentucky, USA: University of Kentucky Press, 2004. Pp. 237. It has been suspected that Saddam Hussein intended to invade and annex a portion of Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province on the justification that the Saudi region of Al-Hasa had been part of the Ottoman province of Basra that the British had helped Saudi Arabia conquer in 1913.Amatzia Baram, Barry Rubin. Iraq's Road To War. New York, New York, USA: St. Martin's Press, 1993. Pp. 127. It is believed that Saddam intended to annex Kuwait and the Al-Hasa oil region, so that Iraq would be in control of the Persian Gulf region's vast oil production, that would make Iraq the dominant power in the Middle East.Sharad S. Chauhan. War On Iraq. APH Publishing, 2003. Pp. 126. The Saudi Arabian government was alarmed by Iraq's mobilization of ten heavily armed and well-supplied Iraqi army divisions along the border of Iraqi-annexed Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and warned the United States government that they believed that Iraq was preparing for an immediate invasion of Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province.Middle East Contemporary Survey, Volume 14; Volume 1990. Pp. 606. The Saudi Arabian government stated that without assistance from outside forces, Iraq could invade and seize control of the entire Eastern Province within six hours.

Iraqi nationalism today After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the country fell into a state of chaos. weak central government along with the rise of sectarian civil war among the Iraqi people diminished the value of Iraqi nationalism. Many who call for a revival Iraqi nationalism the glories of the Iraqi people are stigmatized and stereotyped as Baathists. As living conditions deteriorated in many parts of the country as well as constant fighting made people think less of their Iraqi heritage. In most recent years, analysts observed a surge in Iraqi nationalism and patriotism as most Iraqis blamed sectarianism for the bloodshed and violence in the country.

He lives in Ottawa, where he composes full- time. Early life Andrew Ager was born to a musical family. His maternal grandfather, Charles Aharan, was a professional musician during the early part of his life, and his parents and sisters all played piano. Ager commenced piano studies as a child and began composing seriously around age fourteen. He did not study music at school, but was an avid private piano and theory student in suburban Ottawa, winning several Ottawa Music Festival classes as a teenager. When he was fifteen the family moved to Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia, where Ager dropped out of school a year later and spent much time in a studio on their property studying music and literature on his own. 1990-2010 In the 1990s Ager began to write for larger ensembles and received numerous commissions while living in Halifax and Toronto. He felt that he had waited a certain period of time before doing this in order to \\"get it right\\" in terms of technique and structure. He was especially busy as a freelance pianist and composer in Toronto from 1993-2010, writing for many of Toronto's best known ensembles, such as the Elmer Iseler Singers, The Hannaford Street Silver Band, Talisker Players, and the Penderecki Quartet. 2010-2017 In 2010 Ager moved to a rural address in Quebec near Ottawa where he was able to compose without distraction and attend concerts in the city. During this time he was Composer- in-Residence for various ensembles in Albuquerque, Sulmona (Italy), and Ottawa and had his music performed in Berlin, Venice, Monte Carlo, Paris, and New York City, as well as locally. At present he lives in Rockcliffe, Ottawa, and is writing a full-scale grand opera based on a prominent American crime family. Operas=Frankenstein Ager's first opera \\"Frankenstein\\" Victor Frankenstein with Creature Ager's first opera \\"Frankenstein\\" was produced in Toronto in 2010 by Tryptych, and received excellent reviews such as \\"Ager's music is so evocative that it should be half again as long, lush yet propulsive\\". \\"Frankenstein\\" received its powerful Ottawa premiere in November 2019 at the Carleton Dominion Chalmers Centre. Fully staged, and with special effects, this production was a highlight of Ottawa's opera season.  The Wings of the Dove  In 2013 the Centre for Opera Studies in Italy (COSI) mounted Ager's new work \\"The Wings of the Dove\\", based on Henry James' novel. This performance took place at Toronto's Heliconian Hall in a production by Michael Albano. \\"The Wings of the Dove\\" captures the final climactic episode in the James novel - a compelling tale of love, greed, and betrayal. With a performance time of 1 hour, 15 minutes, this chamber opera is perfect repertoire for any operatic evening. Frankenstein's Creature in Ager's opera Casanova In 2014, Ager's comic opera \\"Casanova\\" was premiered by Ottawa's \\"Seventeen Voyces\\", directed by Kevin Reeves, and was produced again in Toronto by COSI the same year. F√ºhrerbunker Ager's next opera \\"F√ºhrerbunker\\" had its premier in 2015 in Kitchener, as a co-production with the Waterloo Centre for German Studies. The work then received several productions by COSI in Toronto. This work, regarded as controversial in terms of its subject matter, is a depiction of the fall of Berlin in 1945. Described as a \\"morbid historical drama\\", the opera shows the decline and suicide of Adolf Hitler amidst the crumbling surroundings of his underground bunker, in the company of Eva Braun and the remaining staff as Berlin fell to the Soviet armed forces. Ager was advised against writing it - but he has succeeded in creating a stage work that unsympathetically shows the human end of an evil historical figure. \\"F√ºhrerbunker\\" was produced again in Ottawa in 2016 at the Mayfair Theatre, to much acclaim and discussion. \\"F√ºhrerbunker\\" promotional poster The Unknown Soldier In April 2017, Ager conducted a multi-media performance of his work \\"The Unknown Soldier\\" at the Canadian War Museum. The work was adapted and re-orchestrated for the event, which was a commemoration of the 100th Anniversary of the Battle of Vimy Ridge. It includes texts by Canadian, French, British, and German soldiers.  The Eleventh Hour  In November 2018, Ager conducted the Cantata Signers of Ottawa and Orchestra for the premiere of his work \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" at a gala concert commemorating the 100th Anniversary of the end of WWI at the Canadian War Museum.  A Christmas Carol  Commissioned by Philip and Eleanor Rogers, \\"A Christmas Carol\\" (2019) is Ager's take on the well-known Dickens tale. With a performance time of 40 minutes, for chamber ensemble (various versions available or piano only), baritone solo, mixed choir (children's choir optional for trebles) and several easy solos, it is a delightful seasonal evening of entertainment. Ager's earthy humour and twist on the end of the story was particularly well-received. Upcoming Work (2020-22) \\"Dracula\\", the second of Ager's \\"The Gothic Trilogy\\", is slated for world premiere in November 2021 in Ottawa. Ager is writing \\"Angel\\", a chamber opera set in the Underworld of 1970's New York City. It is a story of deception and survival in a perilous world. \\"Angel\\", a young dancer, is in a dangerous situation and finds unknown strengths in herself to survive against all odds. Benjamin Spierman, General Director of the Bronx Opera, will be welcomed as artistic director for the premiere production. The Centre for Opera Studies and Appreciation, based in Toronto, Darryl Edwards, Artistic Director, is commissioning Ager to write \\"The Waves\\", a ghost story using original music and referencing Maritime Folksong.

Early life  Oskar Bider grew up in Langenbruck (canton of Basel-Land) and graduated from the primary school to the district school in Waldenburg. He had no interest in his father's business as draper and preferred to become a farmer; he attended the Agricultural School in Langenthal and then worked on several farms. Having completed the primary military service (Rekrutenschule) in Switzerland in June 1911, he decided to emigrate to Argentina and worked in 1911/12 as a gaucho on the farm of a Swiss citizen living in Romang, Santa Fe.  Aviation pioneer  Driven by ambition and nostalgia, Oskar returned to Europe in 1912. On November 8 of that year he joined Bl√©riot's aviation school in Pau, situated in the northern Pyrenees. After one month of training he earned an international pilot's licence on December 8, 1912 with Swiss pilot's licence number 32. He later bought a Bl√©riot XI monoplane, and on January 24, 1913, pioneered in crossing the Pyrenees from Pau to Madrid. In March 1913 he returned to Switzerland by train, welcomed at the border in Basel as a much-admired 'aviation hero'. On March 9 he flew the first airmail flight in Switzerland from Basel to Liestal. Later that year on May 13 he crossed the Alps from Bern to Sion, Switzerland for the first time. Emile Tadd√©oli lost a wheel while taking off to fly from Bern to Biel/Bienne on June 3, 1913. Bider witnessed the incident and took off with the wheel to catch up with Tadd√©oli and warn him of the danger. Tadd√©oli acknowledged and landed without a problem in Biel/Bienne.  First Alpine flight  Bider's big goal was crossing the Alps from Bern to Milano which had been attempted three years earlier by fellow aviation pioneer Jorge Ch√°vez. He prepared for this ambitious flight carefully and left nothing to chance. His first attempt did not happen as planned because a prior test flight showed that his airplane, with a 70-hp engine and full fuel tanks could not reach the required altitude in the thin mountain air. He decided to stop halfway in Domodossola to refuel and finish the flight. On July 13, 1913‚Äîone day after his 22nd birthday‚Äîhe took off at 4 a.m. in Bern for Italy. The Jungfraujoch (Young maiden ridge) was the greatest obstacle for this flight and for over half an hour Bider struggled desperately before he finally reached the required altitude of resulting in a new Swiss record. At 6:10 a.m. he passed the top of Jungfraujoch with about of clearance. He stopped in Domodossola for fuel as planned and then finished his journey in Milano. He waited 13 days in Milano for good weather conditions and then flew back this time crossing Lukmanier Pass and Chr√ºzli Pass in northern Switzerland. He landed in Liestal to refuel and continued on to Basel and then to Bern. Bider thus became the first aviator to cross the Alps in both directions.  Other records  Continuing his pioneering streak, on August 1, 1913, Bider completed the first night flight in Switzerland. On Christmas Day 1913, Bider set a new record flying from Paris to Bern in 4 hours and 20 minutes non-stop. On June 21, 1919, Bider accomplished another great aviation performance in benefit of the civil aviation: he started with two passengers in St. Jakob, Basel, for a flight around Switzerland, landing successfully after seven and a half hours at the starting point. Commercial services Oskar Bider and Fritz Rihner started the Schweizerische Gesellschaft f√ºr Lufttourismus (Swiss Society for air tourism) in July 1919. Tour flights‚Äîusing flying boats‚Äîwere planned from sites at Z√ºrichhorn, Geneva, Interlaken/Thun, Locarno, Lugano, Lucerne, Lausanne-Ouchy, Romanshorn and St. Moritz. Unfortunately, Oskar would be killed in a plane crash before the ambitious project was realized. Death In the early morning of July 7, 1919, Bider left the officers' mess at D√ºbendorf airfield. He had spent the previous few days celebrating the completion of his service in the Swiss Air Force, which had ended on July 2. But before starting the commercial tourist flights, he wanted to put on an aerobatic display for his former military colleagues. So after a sleepless night at 6.30am he took off in a Nieuport 21 fighter for the demonstration. However, during a manoeuvre his plane entered an unrecoverable stall causing it to crash into the ground killing Bider instantly. When news of his death reached his devoted 25-year-old sister, Julie Helene \\"Leny\\" Bider (she had moved to Zurich in 1915 to live near her famous brother), she shot herself that afternoon in her room at the Hotel Bellevue au Lac, in Z√ºrich. Oskar and Leny Bider were buried together in their hometown of Langenbruck on July 10, 1919. Mystery still surrounds the death of Bider because the exact circumstances of his crash were never publicized for decades. A crash investigation found that the plane's engine and control cables were all in working order at the time. As mechanical issues were not the cause, the official report theorized that the swiftness of one of Bider's manoeuvres probably resulted in his loss of consciousness. However, this conclusion has been questioned because it was not published until decades after Bider's death and to the leadership of the Swiss Army \\"a military pilot and aviator does not take his life!\\" (Ein Milit√§rpilot und Fliegeridol nimmt sich sicher nicht das Leben!).  Honors  Bider memorial by Hermann Haller in Bern In Bern, a monument designed by Hermann Haller remembers Bider's aeronautical services. Several streets were named after him: \\"Oskar Bider-Strasse\\" in Langenbruck, D√ºbendorf, Liestal and Z√ºrich and \\"rue Oscar Bider\\" in Sion and Geneva. Among other Swiss air pioneers, he is commemorated with a Swiss postage stamp issued in 1977. The Bider-Hangar, called after Oskar, one of the hangars at Bern Airport, is listed as a heritage site in the November 2008 review draft of the Swiss Inventory of Cultural Property of National and Regional Significance.

The FTC further stated that ‚Äúbackstop legislation addressing online profiling is still required to fully ensure that consumers‚Äô privacy is protected online‚Äù and recommended that [technology neutral] legislation be passed that created a basic level of privacy protection for users of ‚Äúconsumer-oriented commercial websites with respect to profiling‚Äù.FTC, Online Profiling: A Report To Congress, Part 2 Recommendations (July 2000), at 10, http://www.ftc.gov/os/2000/07/onlineprofiling.pdf . Under the FTC‚Äôs 2000 proposal, all online advertising networks and consumer-oriented commercial websites that allowed the collection of information from or about consumers would be required to implement and comply with the FIPPs. Congress did not enact the FTC‚Äôs recommended legislation, and another decade would pass before the FTC again proposed legislation to regulate OBA.FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change: A Proposed Framework for Businesses and Policymakers (December 1, 2010), http://www.ftc.gov/os/2010/12/101201privacyreport.pdf. FTC Commissioner Timothy Muris turned the FTC‚Äôs attention away from online privacy and OBA regulation in 2001, stating, ‚Äú[t]he slowing of the growth of the Internet emphasizes the need to understand the cost of online privacy legislation‚Ä¶At this time, we need more law enforcement, not more laws‚Äù.Timothy J. Muris, Protecting Consumers' Privacy: 2002 and Beyond, Remarks delivered at the Privacy 2001 Conference (October 4, 2001), http://www.ftc.gov/speeches/muris/privisp1002.shtm .  Return to regulatory focus  In 2006 the FTC once again took up the mantle of online privacy protection at the November 2006 FTC forum, ‚ÄúTech-ade‚Äù, which examined the ‚Äúkey technological and business developments that will shape consumers‚Äô core experiences in the coming ten years‚Äù.FTC, Protecting Consumers in the Next Tech-ade: A Report by the Staff of the Federal Trade Commission (March 2008), http://www.ftc.gov/os/2008/03/P064101tech.pdf. Participants at the forum described how technological advances in online profiling (now called ‚Äúbehavioral‚Äù advertising, targeting, or marketing), had allowed the practice to become more widespread and efficient.FTC Staff Report, Self-Regulatory Principles For Online Behavioral Advertising, Behavioral Advertising Tracking, Targeting, & Technology (February 2009), at 8, . Building on the Tech-ade hearings, the FTC hosted a town hall meeting in November 2007 focused specifically on the privacy implications of behavioral advertising practices called, ‚ÄúEhavioral Advertising: Tracking, Targeting, and Technology‚Äù.FTC, Town Hall, Ehavioral Advertising: Tracking, Targeting, and Technology, http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/workshops/ehavioral/index.shtml. The public meeting was prompted, in part, by the growth of behavioral advertising and the interest of large Internet companies in using such techniques to deliver narrowly targeted ads. These developments included Google‚Äôs plans to acquire DoubleClick, AOL‚Äôs interest in Tacoda, and Microsoft and Yahoo‚Äôs continued expansion of their own behavioral advertising products.See FTC to Examine Consumer Tracking Practices Used by Online Ad Industry, 6 PVLR 1275 (2007). They also included a presentation by eBay with a live demonstration of the ebay.com website, highlighting the first on ad links enabling consumers to opt out of behavioral ads via an eBay program called AdChoice. In December 2007, the FTC promulgated a set of proposed ‚ÄúPrinciples‚Äù intended to provide a basis for the online advertising industry‚Äôs self-regulatory efforts to address privacy concerns.FTC, Online Behavioral Advertising Moving the Discussion Forward to Possible Self-Regulatory Principles (December 2007), http://www.ftc.gov/os/2007/12/P859900stmt.pdf . The Principles ‚Äúcall for companies to obtain affirmative express consent from consumers before they use data in a manner that is materially different than promised at the time of collection and before they collect and use 'sensitive' consumer data for behavioral advertising‚Äù.FTC, Online Behavioral Advertising Moving the Discussion Forward to Possible Self-Regulatory Principles (December 2007), at 5, http://www.ftc.gov/os/2007/12/P859900stmt.pdf . The FTC followed up this 2007 report with a further report in 2009, which further clarified the self- regulatory principles.FTC Staff Report, Self-Regulatory Principles For Online Behavioral Advertising, Behavioral Advertising Tracking, Targeting, & Technology (February 2009), . At the time, a coalition of consumer groups proposed a ‚ÄúDo Not Track List‚Äù in their comments to the 2007 town hall meeting.FTC Staff Report, Self-Regulatory Principles For Online Behavioral Advertising, Behavioral Advertising Tracking, Targeting, & Technology (February 2009), at 32, .  The FTC‚Äôs 2010 report  In a December 2010 report, the FTC proposed a new regulatory framework for consumer data privacy, including a proposal for a ‚ÄúDo Not Track‚Äù mechanism which would allow Internet users to opt out of OBA. In the report the FTC describes the limitations of the existing notice and choice model, which it states, ‚Äúhave become increasingly apparent in recent years‚Äù.FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change: A Proposed Framework for Businesses and Policymakers (December 1, 2010), at 19, http://www.ftc.gov/os/2010/12/101201privacyreport.pdf. The FTC states that the notice and choice-based model, ‚Äúencourages companies to develop privacy notices describing their information collection and use practices to consumers, so that consumers can make informed choices‚Äù.FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change: A Proposed Framework for Businesses and Policymakers (December 1, 2010), at iii, http://www.ftc.gov/os/2010/12/101201privacyreport.pdf. However, ‚Äúthe notice- and-choice model, as implemented, has led to long, incomprehensible privacy policies that consumers typically do not read, let alone understand. Likewise, the harm-based model has been criticized for failing to recognize a wider range of privacy-related concerns, including reputational harm or the fear of being monitored‚Äù. In order to address the issues with the notice-and-choice- based model, the FTC‚Äôs proposed privacy framework calls on companies to provide consumers with a meaningful choice in regards to OBA tracking, but sets forth ‚Äúa limited set of data practices for which choice is not necessary‚Äù called ‚Äúcommonly accepted practices‚Äù.FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change: A Proposed Framework for Businesses and Policymakers (December 1, 2010), at 53, http://www.ftc.gov/os/2010/12/101201privacyreport.pdf. The commonly accepted practices include: Product and service fulfillment, internal operations, fraud prevention, legal compliance and first-party marketing, including contextual marketing.FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change: A Proposed Framework for Businesses and Policymakers (December 1, 2010), at 53 ‚Äì 55, see also note 134 at 55, http://www.ftc.gov/os/2010/12/101201privacyreport.pdf. OBA, along with deep packet inspection (DPI), are specifically noted as not ‚Äúcommonly accepted practices‚Äù.FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change: A Proposed Framework for Businesses and Policymakers (December 1, 2010), at 58, http://www.ftc.gov/os/2010/12/101201privacyreport.pdf. Furthermore, the report states that the FTC supports prior ‚Äúaffirmative express consent‚Äù in regards to the collection of ‚Äúsensitive information‚Äù (children, financial and medical information, precise geolocation data) for OBA.FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change: A Proposed Framework for Businesses and Policymakers (December 1, 2010), at 61, http://www.ftc.gov/os/2010/12/101201privacyreport.pdf.  Do Not Track  In the 2010 report, the FTC proposed a ‚Äúuniform and comprehensive consumer choice mechanism‚Äù for OBA, referred to as ‚ÄúDo Not Track‚Äù. The FTC states, ‚Äú[t]he most practical method of providing uniform choice for online behavioral advertising would likely involve placing a setting similar to a persistent cookie on a consumer‚Äôs browser and conveying that setting to sites that the browser visits, to signal whether or not the consumer wants to be tracked or receive targeted advertisements‚Äù.FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change: A Proposed Framework for Businesses and Policymakers (December 1, 2010), at 66, http://www.ftc.gov/os/2010/12/101201privacyreport.pdf. The FTC believes that a \\"Do Not Track\\" mechanism is preferable to the existing browser-based cookie opt-outs as it is more ‚Äúclear, easy to locate and effective‚Äù and it conveys the user‚Äôs choice to opt out of tracking directly to websites.FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change: A Proposed Framework for Businesses and Policymakers (December 1, 2010), at 67, http://www.ftc.gov/os/2010/12/101201privacyreport.pdf.  FTC goes to Congress  On March 16, 2011, the FTC appeared before the United States Senate Commerce Committee. At the hearing, the FTC recommended imposing more stringent measures to protect Internet users against unauthorized tracking in support of behavioral advertising, including a universal Do Not Track browser setting.Dominique R. Shelton and Clinton J. McCord, How to Respond to Recent Developments in Consumer Information Regulation (March 23, 2011), http://www.wildman.com/bulletin/3232011/ . The FTC also announced its first behavioral advertising case, filed against network advertiser Chitika for using a deceptive opt-out mechanism. As part of the settlement, the FTC required that Chitika link all its advertising to an effective opt-out mechanism in future. It has been commented that, ‚Äú[t]his requirement of a hyperlink embedded in online advertisements is a good indicator of the type of Do Not Track mechanism that will be acceptable to the FTC if 'Do Not Track' becomes mandatory‚Äù. At the same Senate hearing, the Barack Obama administration called for a new ‚ÄúInternet user‚Äôs bill of rights‚Äù, which would give the FTC authority to regulate online behavioral advertising.  Congress proposes legislation = Do Not Track Me Online Act of 2011 Representative Jackie Speier (D-CA) introduced the ‚ÄúDo Not Track Me Online Act of 2011‚Äù,H.R. 654, Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA), Do Not Track Me Online Act of 2011, http://speier.house.gov/uploads/Do%20Not%20Track%20Me%20Online%20Act.pdf which would authorize the FTC to promulgate regulations requiring online advertisers and websites to allow users to opt out of having their online activities tracked through the creation of a do-not-track mechanism. The bill gives users the ability to block all collection of data for OBA but gives an exception for commonly accepted practices such as fraud prevention and inventory control. The bill authorizes the FTC to enforce the new regulations by conducting random audits of Web publishers, although the proposed regulations contain an exception for websites that have less than 10,000 visitors per year.Wendy Davis, Privacy 'Track' Bill Draws Key Support, Online Media Daily (February 11, 2011), http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/144858/ The bill never reached a vote and died in Congress.H.R. 654 ‚Äî 112th Congress: Do Not Track Me Online Act.‚Äù www.GovTrack.us. 2011.

The bill calls for the FTC to create regulations requiring businesses collecting personally identifiable information, such as names and email addresses, to provide ‚Äúclear, concise and timely notice‚Äù of data collection, use and transfer, along with ‚Äúa clear and conspicuous mechanism for opt-out consent for any unauthorized use of [consumers'] personally identifiable information.‚Äù The bill contains a provision which would require opt-in consent for the ‚Äúcollection, use or transfer of sensitive personally identifiable information‚Äù. Sensitive personally identifiable information is defined as ‚Äúpersonally identifiable information which, if lost, compromised, or disclosed without authorization either alone or with other information, carries a significant risk of economic or physical harm‚Äù or is related to a particular medical condition, health record or the religious affiliation of an individual. The bill also tasks the FTC with establishing a voluntary safe harbor program to review, approve, and monitor self-regulatory programs that provide consumers with ‚Äúclear, conspicuous, persistent and effective‚Äù opt-out from online behavioral advertising or location-based advertising.Cecilia Kang,Senators Introduce Internet Privacy Bill, Washington Post (April 4, 2011), https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-tech/post/senators-introduce- internet-privacy-bill/2011/04/12/AFL0CjRD_blog.html Once a self-regulatory program is approved by the FTC and the members of that program are covered by the safe harbor, those members would be exempt from some of the provisions of the bill. The bill does not include the FTC‚Äôs proposed Do Not Track mechanism, which Senator McCain stated at the press conference, ‚Äúdidn't seem to fit in our ability to get a balance for consumer and industry support‚Äù. The bill also does not include a private right of action, leaving enforcement up to the FTC and State Attorneys General. Consumer and privacy advocates have stated that the bill was not strong enough and should contain the FTC‚Äôs Do Not Track proposal.

Its counterpart in the House is H.R. 4892, introduced by Howard McKeon (R-CA). In introducing the bill on the Senate floor, McCain said: > This legislation seeks to ensure that the mistakes made during the > apprehension of the Christmas Day bomber, such as reading him a Miranda > warning, will never happen again and put Americans‚Äô security at risk. According to the legal news service JURIST both the American Civil Liberties Union and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham expressed concerns over the proposed bill. The Bill According to the bill's official summary, the bill requires that any person who is arrested on suspicion of terrorism against the United States or its coalition partners be placed in military custody for the purposes of initial interrogation and determination of status as an \\"unprivileged enemy belligerent\\". Such determination is to be made within 48 hours. The bill proceeds to define an \\"unprivileged enemy belligerent\\" as an individual who: # has engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners; # has purposely and materially supported hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners; or # was a part of al Qaeda at the time of capture. The bill authorizes the President to establish a \\"high-value detainee interrogation group\\" consisting of executive branch personnel with expertise in national security, terrorism, intelligence, interrogation, or law enforcement to perform the interrogation and status determination. The bill defines that the paramount purpose of such interrogations is the protection of U.S. civilians and facilities through thorough and professional interrogation for intelligence purposes. It further prohibits the use of Department of Justice (DOJ) appropriated funds to prosecute an unprivileged enemy belligerent in an Article III court. Finally, the bill allows for the detention of a person who is deemed to be an unprivileged enemy belligerent without criminal charges or trial for the duration of hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners in which the individual has engaged or which the individual has purposely and materially supported.

Lahore, with a population of six million, is Pakistan's second largest city, and the capital of the Punjab province. After several attacks in Lahore in 2009, these were the first major incidents in the city in 2010. The 12 March bombings are the deadliest attacks in Pakistan to date in 2010. 8 March The 8 March 2010 Lahore bombing was a suicide bombing in Lahore, Pakistan that killed 13 people and injured 90. Around 0810 PKT, an individual drove a vehicle carrying a large amount of explosives into the Federal Investigation Agency's office in the Model Town district of Lahore. The building collapsed due to the damage it sustained. The bomb was in size, powerful enough to create a crater deep, and injure someone in a house 300 m away from the detonation. The building had previously been attacked on 15 October 2009, in an incident that killed four people. Reaction Pakistani officials have reportedly blamed al-Qaeda and the Taliban for the incident. Rehman Malik, Pakistan's Interior Minister, said that while more attacks by the Taliban were expected, they were \\"desperate measures by a desperate organization\\". Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif condemned the attacks and said the victims would be compensated. A spokesperson for the Taliban in Pakistan claimed the attack was retribution for recent attacks by the Pakistani military and the United States Central Intelligence Agency on tribal areas; and said \\"We have 2,800 to 3,000 more suicide bombers ... We will target all government places, buildings and offices,\\" More specifically they said it was to avenge the death of Qari Zafar. India denied involvement in the attacks, following allegations by several Pakistani media sources. ‚ÄúWe categorically reject, once again, the allegations of India's involvement in such acts or activities. The government has reiterated, on several occasions and at the highest level, that India has no interest in destabilizing Pakistan,‚Äù the Indian Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement.

It was the second attack in Lahore that week, following a bomb explosion at an intelligence headquarters on 8 March 2010. Around 1300 local time, two men on foot and wearing vests carrying explosives detonated bombs near the Royal Artillery Bazaar. One man detonated his vest first, followed by the other ten to fifteen seconds later. It was speculated that the intended target was a military convoy in the area at the time. The blasts wounded about 100 people, mostly civilians, and killed at least 59, of which ten were soldiers. Local Police officials have said that the death toll is likely to rise. Following the bombings, military reinforcements took control of the area, preventing even news media from entering. In the late afternoon, five more bombs were detonated in an Iqbal Town market, but their main consequence was panic. Some windows were broken, and a car was damaged, and three injuries were reported. Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, the same group responsible for the 8 March bombing, has claimed responsibility for these attacks, as well. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi has also claimed responsibility for the 12 March attack. Seizure of material On 15 March 2010, police seized of explosives in a raid on an empty shop in Lahore. Also seized were grenades, suicide bomb vests and ammunition. The shop owner was arrested.

Brooks, and illustrated by Kurt Wiese. Freddy, ducks Alice and Emma, and the Webb spiders are cast on a voyage when a fairground balloon will not return to the ground. Days later when landing, Freddy must confront the dishonest balloon owner who received money from Mr. Bean for damages. Plot summary In a poetic mood, Freddy suggests ducks Alice and Emma repeat the feat of the first animals to fly in a balloon. But Mr. Golcher, a balloon owner who is in town, feels that Freddy giving a speech from the balloon would attract more customers. The balloon is released, but over the Bean farm they discover they cannot come down. By the time they float west over Syracuse, New York everyone is enjoying ride. During the cold night the wind changes direction. They are lost and out of food. A friendly eagle discovers them, takes a message to the Beans, and returns with a picnic basket. As the next night passes they ride along with a thunderstorm. In the morning the balloon is low enough for the grapnel dangling over the edge to catch on a house. It is home to villains from the first book, who recognize Freddy, and narrowly miss capturing the balloon. The animals learn, however, that they are wanted by the police. Freddy decided to leave the balloon, even if it means a dangerous jump. After landing, the pig disguises himself, but is soon found by his friend the sheriff. Pretending he does not recognize him, the sheriff updates Freddy, who dangerously decides to return to the Bean farm, which is staked out by police. At the farm Golcher threatens Mr. Bean, who agrees to pay $200 for what Golcher has lost so far. Freddy calculates how long this will take to repay: :‚Äù‚ÄôIf it takes two years to get seven dollars,‚Äô he said to Mrs. Wiggins, ‚Äòhow long would it take to get two hundred?‚Äô :‚ÄôSeven hundred years,‚Äô said Mrs. Wiggins. :Freddy didn‚Äôt think that was right‚Ä¶.but Mrs. Wiggins stuck to seven hundred. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs only common sense,‚Äô she said. ‚ÄòIf you get seven dollars in two years, then in seven hundred you get two hundred.‚Äô‚Äù (p. 114) Freddy hides at the circus of his friend Mr. Boomschmidt, who agrees to let elephants tow the balloon to the circus to be returned to Golcher. In the meantime, back at the balloon, the ducks Alice and Emma have discovered their long lost Uncle Wesley, who is making a living selling shoddy goods to forest animals. Disillusioned, they nonetheless ask him to return to the Bean farm. Although his balloon is returned, Golcher proves quarrelsome, refusing to return Mr. Bean‚Äôs money. Freddy and the animals agree to do a free show for Golcher, but afterward, Golcher still is not satisfied. Freddy and Golcher decide to resolve their differences in a fight ring, and Golcher makes a remark about eating pork that Freddy finds ‚Äúin rather bad taste‚Äù. Freddy is losing a fair fight, until his spider friends bite Golcher. Golcher is ready to admit his defeat, but Freddy stops him. :‚Äù‚ÄôDo you like being honest?‚Äù he asked. :‚ÄôNot exactly,‚Äô said Freddy truthfully. :‚ÄôThen why do you do it when you don‚Äôt have to?‚Äô :‚ÄôI don‚Äôt know. I suppose maybe because Mr. Bean thinks I‚Äôm honest. I sort of want him to be right.‚Äô (p. 220) Golcher decides to be honest for once himself, and returns Mr. Bean‚Äôs money.

La G√°ndara was born in Paris, France, but his father was of Spanish ancestry, born in San Luis Potos√≠, Mexico, and his mother was from England. La G√°ndara's talent was strongly influenced by both cultures. At only 15 years of age, La G√°ndara was admitted as a student of Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me and Cabanel at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. Soon, he was recognized by the jury of the 1883 Salon des Champs-√âlys√©es, who singled out the first work he ever exhibited: a portrait of Saint Sebastian. Less than ten years later, young La G√°ndara had become one of the favourite artists of the Paris elite. His models included Countess Greffulhe, the Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg, the Princess of Chimay, the Prince de Polignac, the Prince de Sagan, Charles Leconte de Lisle, Paul Verlaine, Leonor Uriburu de Anchorena, Sarah Bernhardt, Romaine Brooks, Jean Moreas, Winnaretta Singer, and Virginie Am√©lie Avegno Gautreau (seen below, and more famously portrayed by John Singer Sargent in his painting Madame X). Influenced by Chardin, his skill is demonstrated in his portraits, in a simplicity with the finest detail, or in the serenity of his scenes of the bridges, parks, and streets of Paris. Madame Pierre Gautreau, 1898 Gandara illustrated a small number of publications, including Les Dana√Ødes by Camille Mauclair. With James McNeill Whistler, Jean-Louis Forain, and Yamamoto, La G√°ndara illustrated Les Chauves- Souris (\\"The Bats\\") by the French poet Robert de Montesquiou. The book, published in 1893, has become a rare collector's item. The first exhibition of La G√°ndara's work organised in New York by Durand-Ruel in 1898 was a major success and confirmed the painter as one of the masters of his time. Major newspapers and magazines routinely reproduced his portraits, several of which made the front page of publications like the fashionable Le Figaro magazine. Gandara participated in the most important exhibitions in Paris, Brussels, Berlin, Dresden, Barcelona and Saragossa. La G√°ndara died on 30 June 1917, and was interred in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery, Paris. Although his fame faded rapidly after his death, growing interest in the 20th century saw him regain popularity as a key witness to the art of his time, not only through his canvases, but also as the model chosen by the novelists Jean Lorrain and Marcel Proust, and through the anecdotes of his own life narrated by Edmond de Goncourt, Georges-Michel, and Montesquiou. On 3 November 2018, a major retrospective opened for four months at the Mus√©e Lambinet in Versailles, bringing together more than one hundred works by the painter as well as many documents. The exhibition curator was Xavier Mathieu. A novel was published by the Editions L'Harmattan in 2016 that treats La G√°ndara's life: Antonio de La Gandara ‚Äì The Gentleman painter of the Belle Epoque.

He was known as the \\"Organizer of Victory\\" in the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars. Education and early life Born on 13 May 1753 in the village of Nolay, C√¥te-d'Or, Carnot was the son of local judge and royal notary, Claude Carnot and his wife, Marguerite Pothier. He was the second oldest of seven children. At the age of fourteen, Lazare and his brother were enrolled at the Coll√®ge d'Autun, in Burgundy where he focused on the study of philosophy and the classics. He held a strong belief in stoic philosophy and was deeply influenced by Roman civilization. When he turned fifteen, he left the Coll√®ge d'Autun to strengthen his philosophical knowledge and study under the Society of the Priests of Saint Sulpice. During his short time with them, he studied logic, mathematics and theology under the Abbe Bison. After being impressed with Lazare's work as a scholar, the Duke D‚ÄôAumont (Marquis de Nolay) recommended a military career for the young one. Carnot was soon sent by his father to the Aumont residence to further his education. Here, he was enrolled in M. de Longpres pension school in 1770 until he was ready to enter one of two prestigious engineering and artillery schools in Paris. A year later, in February 1771, he was ranked the third highest among twelve who were chosen out of his class of more than one hundred who took the entrance exams. It was at this point when he entered the √âcole royale du g√©nie de M√©zi√®res, appointed as a second lieutenant. Studies at the M√©zi√®res included geometry, mechanics, geometrical designing, geography, hydraulics and material preparation. On 1 January 1773 he graduated the school, ranked as a first lieutenant. He was eighteen years old. It was here where he met and studied with Benjamin FranklinDino De Paoli, Lazare Carnot's Grand Strategy for Political Victory. Executive Intelligence Review (1996) at the age of twenty. He obtained commission as a lieutenant in Louis Joseph, Prince of Cond√©'s engineer corps. At this moment, he made a name for himself both in the line of (physics) theoretical engineering and in his work in the field of fortifications. While in the army, he continued his study of mathematics. In 1784 he published his first work Essay on Machines, which contained a statement that foreshadowed the principle of energy as applied to a falling weight, and the earliest proof that kinetic energy is lost in the collision of imperfectly elastic bodies. This publication earned him the honor of admittance to a literary society. Another turning point was his essay on Vauban in which he praises the engineer on his works while at the same time developing his own career as a writer/engineer. Vauban's work had a profound effect on his work as a general and engineer. In that same year, he also received a promotion to the rank of captain. Political career At the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, Carnot entered political life. He became a delegate to the Legislature in 1791. While a member of the Legislative Assembly, Carnot was elected to the Committee of Public Instruction. He believed that all citizens should be educated. As a member of that committee, he wrote a series of reforms for the teaching and educational systems, but they were not implemented due to the violent social and economic climate of the Revolution. After the Legislative Assembly was dissolved, Carnot was elected to the National Convention in 1792. He spent the last few months of 1792 on a mission to Bayonne, organizing the military defense effort in an attempt to ward off any possible attacks from Enlightenment-era Spain. Upon returning to Paris, Carnot voted for the death of King Louis XVI, although he had been absent for the debates surrounding the Trial of Louis XVI. On 14 August 1793 Carnot was elected to the Committee of Public Safety, where he took charge of the military situation as one of the Ministers of War. With the establishment of the Directory in 1795, Carnot became one of the five initial directors. For the first year, the Directors did well working harmoniously together as well as with the Councils. However, difference of political views led to a schism between Carnot and √âtienne- Fran√ßois Letourneur, followed by Fran√ßois de Barth√©lemy, on the one side, and the triumvirate of Paul Fran√ßois Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras, Jean- Fran√ßois Rewbell, and Louis Marie de La R√©velli√®re-L√©peaux on the other side. Carnot and Barth√©lemy supported concessions to end the war, and hoped to oust the triumvirate and replace them with more conservative men. After Letourneur had been replaced by another close collaborator of Carnot, Fran√ßois de Barth√©lemy, both of them, alongside many deputies in the Council of Five Hundred, were ousted in the Coup of 18 Fructidor (4 September 1797), engineered by Generals Napoleon Bonaparte (originally, Carnot's prot√©g√©) and Pierre Fran√ßois Charles Augereau. Carnot took refuge in Geneva, and there in 1797 issued his La m√©taphysique du calcul infinit√©simal.  Military accomplishments  Lazare Carnot, a feverishly productive member of the Committee of Public Safety during the Reign of Terror. His part in raising the lev√©e en masse probably saved the French Revolutionary armies from defeat at the hands of their numerically superior opponents. The creation of the French Revolutionary Army was largely due to his powers of organization and enforcing discipline. In order to raise more troops for the war, Carnot introduced conscription: the lev√©e en masse approved by the National Convention was able to raise France's army from 645,000 troops in mid-1793 to 1,500,000 in September 1794. He was the first to execute the modern waging of war with mass armies and strategic planning realized by the Revolution. As a military engineer, Carnot favored fortresses and defensive strategies.R.R. Palmer, The Twelve Who Ruled. Princeton: Princeton University Press (1941) He developed innovative defensive designs for forts, including the Carnot wall, called after him. However, with the constant invasions he decided to take his strategic planning to an offensive strike. From his intellect sprang the maneuvers and organization that turned the tides of war from 1793 to 1794.S.J. Watson. Carnot.London:The Bodley Head (1954) The basic idea was to have a massive army separated into several units that could move more quickly than the enemy and attack from the flanks rather than head on, which had led to resounding defeats before Carnot was elected to the Committee of Public Safety. This tactic was extremely successful against the more traditional tactics of existing European armies. It was his initiative to train the conscripts in the art of war and to place new recruits with experienced soldiers rather than having a massive volunteer army without any real idea of how to wage battle. Once the problem of troop numbers had been solved, Carnot turned his administrative skills to the supplies that this massive army would need. Many of the munitions and supplies were in short supply: copper was lacking for guns so he ordered church bells seized in order to melt them down; saltpeter was lacking and he called chemistry to his aid; leather for boots was scarce so he demanded and secured new methods for tanning. He quickly organized the army and helped to turn the tide of the war. It added significantly to discontent with the course of the Revolution in still Bourbon-loyalist areas ‚Äì such as the Vend√©e, which had broken out in open revolt 5 months earlier ‚Äì but the government of the time considered it a success, and Carnot became known as the Organizer of Victory. In autumn 1793, he took charge of French columns on the Northern Front, and contributed to Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's victory in the Battle of Wattignies. = Relationship with Maximilien Robespierre and the Jacobin Club = Carnot met Robespierre for the first time in Arras where he was assigned for military duty and shortly after Robespierre finished his legal studies. Both of them were members of the literary and singing \\"Societe des Rosati.\\" The group was founded in 1778 and was inspired by the works of Chapelle, La Fontaine, and Chaulieu. It was here where they became acquaintances and eventually friends. Robespierre preceded Carnot into the Academy of Arras entering in April 1784 while he entered three years later in 1787. While being an active member of the Committee of Public Safety in 1794, tensions between Carnot and Robespierre began to rise massively. During his time on the committee, which was heavily radical, Carnot signed a total of 43 decrees and drafted 18 of them. Most of them dealt with military tactics and education. Despite leaning on Jacobin beliefs, Carnot was considered the \\"conservative\\" of his half. He was not an official member of the radical group and therefore took on his own independent beliefs in regards to many issues. One of these issues included Robespierre's proposal on an egalitarian social system with which he feverishly disagreed. Although he had taken no steps to oppose the Reign of Terror, he and some other technocrats on the committee, including Robert Lindet and Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau, turned on Maximilien Robespierre and his allies during the Thermidorian Reaction by having him arrested. Robespierre was later killed along with 21 of his followers. Shortly after Robespierre's fall, Carnot was charged for his role during the time but the charges were quickly dismissed when he became a member of the Directory. = Relationship with Napoleon Bonaparte = In 1795, Lazare appointed Napoleon Bonaparte as general in chief of the Army of Italy. He is known to be the only member of the Directory to have supported Napoleon during this time. In 1800 Bonaparte appointed Carnot as Minister of War, and he served in that office at the time of the Battle of Marengo. In 1802 he voted against the establishment of Napoleon's Consular powers for life and the passing of the title to his children, for as Carnot said when speaking of the power necessary to govern a state \\"If this power is the appendage of a hereditary family it becomes despotic.\\" After Napoleon crowned himself emperor on 2 December 1804, Carnot's republican convictions precluded his acceptance of high office under the First French Empire, and he resigned from public life. Probably in response to the fall of the fortress of Vlissingen to the British during the Walcheren Campaign in 1809, Napoleon employed Carnot to write a treatise describing how fortifications could be improved, for the use of the √âcole militaire de Metz. Building on the theories of the controversial engineer Montalembert, Carnot advanced ideas on how the long established bastioned system of fortification could be modified for close defense and to allow for counter attack by the besieged garrison. In 1812, Carnot returned to office in defense of Napoleon during the disastrous invasion of Russia and was assigned the defense of Antwerp against the Sixth Coalition. He surrendered only at the demand of the Count of Artois, who was the younger brother of Louis XVIII and later Charles X. He was later made a Count of the Empire by Napoleon as Lazare Nicolas Marguerite, Comte Carnot. During the Hundred Days, Carnot served as Minister of the Interior for Napoleon, and was exiled as a regicide during the White Terror after the Second Restoration during the reign of Louis XVIII. Retirement and legacy In 1803 Carnot produced his G√©om√©trie de position. This work deals with projective rather than descriptive geometry. Carnot is responsible for initiating the use of cross-ratios: \\"He was the first to introduce the cross (anharmonic) ratio of four points of a line taking account of its sign, thereby sharpening Pappus' concept. He then proved that this ratio is invariant for the four points obtained by cutting four lines of a pencil of lines with different secants. In this way, he established the harmonic properties of the complete quadrilateral.\\"B. L. Laptev & B. A. Rozenfel'd (1996) Mathematics of the 19th Century: Geometry, p. 28, Birkh√§user Verlag This approach to geometry was used by Karl von Staudt four decades later to set a new foundation to mathematics. The Borda‚ÄìCarnot equation in fluid dynamics and several theorems in geometry are named after him: one that describes a property of the incircle and the circumcircle of triangle, one that describes a relation between triangles and conic sections and one that describes a property of certain perpendiculars on triangle sides. Published in 1810 under the title \\"Trait√© de la D√©fense des Places Fortes\\", his ideas on fortification were further developed in the third edition which was published in 1812. An English translation, \\"A Treatise on the Defence of Fortified Places\\" was published in 1814. Although few of his proposals were accepted by mainstream engineers, the Carnot wall, a detached wall at the foot of the escarp, became a common feature in fortifications built in the mid-19th century.Lloyd, E. M. (1887), Vauban, Montalembert, Carnot: Engineer Studies, Chapman and Hall, London (pp. 183‚Äì195) He lived in Warsaw, Congress Poland, and then moved to the Kingdom of Prussia, where he died in the city of Magdeburg. Carnot's remains were interred at the Panth√©on in 1889, at the same time as those of Marie Victor de La Tour-Maubourg, Jean-Baptiste Baudin, and Fran√ßois S√©verin Marceau-Desgraviers. Carnot survived all the phases of the French Revolution, from its beginnings in 1789 until the fall of Napoleon in 1815. On the social and political front, Carnot was the author of many reforms sought to improve the country. One of these was the proposal for compulsory public education for all citizens. He also penned a proposal for the new Constitution which included the \\"Declaration of the Duties of the Citizens\\" that held that there should be not only education but military service for all citizens of France between the ages of twenty and twenty-five. These proposals were in accordance with the Revolutionaries' thinking at the time, which held that men and women should be honored through ability and intelligence rather than through birthright, even though Carnot himself was nobly born.

Essai sur les machines en g√©n√©ral won honorable mention from the Academie sur Science of Paris in 1780. It was revised and published in 1783. In this he outlined a mathematical theory of power transmission in mechanical systems. His essay Principes fondamentaux de l'√©quilibre et du mouvement 1803 was a further revision and expansion of the earlier work. This was \\"the first theoretical analysis of engineering mechanics\\". In this \\"he went on to analyze the movement of energy from one part of the system to another; he found that power is transmitted most efficiently, and the largest amount of useful work done, when friction, turbulence, and other energy wasting factors are kept to a minimum. This was an early and incomplete approach to the general law of conservation of energy.\\" Carnot's son Nicolas L√©onard Sadi Carnot was influenced by his father's work when he undertook his research into the thermal efficiency of steam engines.

It has existed since at least the 10th century, when it was known in Assyria and Egypt. At that time, it might have between two and six strings, but Arabs adopted it, and called it a Tanbur. The characteristic long neck and two strings, tuned five notes apart. It also similar instrument Tambur in Turkish and each of them have same origin.The Stringed Instrument Database History=Origins It is considered that the tambouras' ancestor is the ancient Greek pandouris, also known as pandoura, pandouros or pandourida (œÄŒ±ŒΩŒ¥ŒøœÖœÅŒØœÇ, œÄŒ±ŒΩŒ¥ŒøœçœÅŒ±, œÄŒ¨ŒΩŒ¥ŒøœÖœÅŒøœÇ), from which the word is derived. The tambouras is mentioned in the Byzantine epic of Digenis Akritas, when the hero plays his Œ∏Œ±ŒºœÄŒøœçœÅŒπŒΩ, thambourin (medieval form of tambouras): Name The name resembles that of the Indian tanpura, but the Greek tambouras is a completely different instrument. Since modern Greek words do not have a standard transliteration into the Latin alphabet, the word may be found written in many ways: tampouras, tambouras, tabouras, taburas etc. Even the final -s may be dropped at the transliteration, since it marks the masculine nominative in Greek. Variations of the word are to be found in Greece: tsambouras, tambouri. The word œÑŒ±ŒºœÄŒøœÖœÅŒ¨œÇ comes from Turkish tambur from Arabic ·π≠anb≈´r or Persian tunb≈´ra.ŒõŒµŒæŒπŒ∫œå œÑŒ∑œÇ Œ∫ŒøŒπŒΩŒÆœÇ ŒΩŒµŒøŒµŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ, ed. Institute of Manolis Triantafyllidis, 1998: \\"œÑŒ±ŒºœÄŒøœÖœÅŒ¨œÇ\\"\\"tamboura\\" at Oxforddictionaries.com Type The tambouras is a long-neck fretted instrument of the lute family, close to Turkish saz and the Persian tanbur. It has movable frets that permit playing tunes in the Greek traditional modes (equivalent of the makams of Arabic music and the ichoi of Byzantine music). It was also known as Pandouris, Pandoura and Fandouros in the Byzantine Empire. When the tambouras was tempered, it gave rise to the bouzouki, which is, in fact, a recent development of the tambouras.

It is a common, wood-rotting species throughout the northern hemisphere, typically growing on dead attached branches of broadleaf trees. It has been much confused with Exidia glandulosa.  Taxonomy  The species was originally described from England as Tremella nigricans by Withering in 1776, based on a phrase name published by Dillenius in 1741. It was subsequently considered a synonym of Exidia glandulosa, until Donk revised species concepts in 1966 and placed it in synonymy with Exidia plana.Donk, M.A. (1966). Check list of European hymenomycetous heterobasidiae. Persoonia 4: 145‚Äì335. Changes in the starting point for fungal nomenclatureInternational code for botanical nomenclature http://ibot.sav.sk/icbn/main.htm has made Exidia plana illegitimate, however, leaving Exidia nigricans as the earliest name for the species.Roberts, P. (2009). Exidia nigricans: a new and legitimate name for Exidia plana. Mycotaxon 109: 219‚Äì220. Molecular research has shown that Exidia glandulosa and E. nigricans, though similar, are distinct.Weiss, M & Oberwinkler, F. (2001). Phylogenetic relationships in Auriculariales and related groups ‚Äì hypotheses derived from nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences. Mycological Research 105: 403‚Äì415.  Witches' butter  Both Dillenius (1741) and Withering (1776) gave the English name for this species as \\"Witches' butter\\", though this name has subsequently also been applied to other gelatinous fungi, including Exidia glandulosa and the yellow Tremella mesenterica. It is said to be based on a folk belief that witches milk cows at night and scatter the butter around. Clearly the butter they produce does not look appetizing. In Sweden, it is apparently known as \\"Troll sm√∂r\\" (\\"Troll's butter\\") for the same reason.Rolfe, R.T. & Rolfe, F.W. (1925). The romance of the fungus world. p. 13  Description  Exidia nigricans forms dark sepia to blackish, rubbery-gelatinous fruit bodies that are button-shaped and around across. The fruitbodies occur in clusters and quickly coalesce to form effused, irregular masses or more across. The upper, spore-bearing surface is shiny and dotted with small pimples or pegs. The individual fruitbodies are each attached to the wood at the base. The spore print is white.Breitenbach, J. & Kranzlin, F. (1986). Fungi of Switzerland Vol. 2: 65 (as E. glandulosa)  Microscopic characters  The microscopic characters are typical of the genus Exidia. The basidia are ellipsoid, septate, 15-25 √ó 8-13 ¬µm. The spores are allantoid (sausage-shaped), 14-19 √ó 4.5-5.5 ¬µm.  Similar species  Exidia glandulosa Exidia nigricans and E. glandulosa are frequently confused. The two are similar, but E. glandulosa produces discrete, top-shaped fruitbodies that rarely if ever coalesce. They are indistinguishable microscopically, but DNA research indicates they are distinct. Tremella foliacea is usually a warmer, lighter brown, but can sometimes be dark sepia to black. Its fruitbodies are gelatinous, but usually foliaceous (with flattish lobes or fronds) and never have warts or pegs on the surface. It is common and occurs on both broadleaf trees and conifers.Breitenbach, J. & Kranzlin, F. (1986). Fungi of Switzerland Vol. 2: 66  Habitat and distribution  Exidia nigricans is a wood-rotting species, typically found on dead attached branches of a wide range of broadleaf trees. It persists for some while on fallen branches and logs. The species typically fruits in autumn and winter. It is widely distributed in the northern hemisphere, including North America and Europe.

Collaboration between members of the Organization and Natural Environment section of the Academy of Management and the Section on Environment and Technology section of the American Sociological Association was at the heart of the journal's framework. During this period O&E; became a prominent outlet for environmental sociology, publishing articles both from established and world-renowned environmental thinkers and younger scholars who would later become leaders in environmental sociology. The journal played an important role in increasing the influence of environmental sociology within the larger discipline and by 2011 its impact factor had grown to rival that of distinguished general interest journals such as Social Problems and Social Forces.

Accessed: August 29, 2012.  Criticism  The December 2012 editorial transition was strongly criticized by (now former) editorial board members of Organization & Environment as an \\"editorial coup\\" on the part of Sage and GRONEN. According to one account, the editorial transition was decided upon and carried out by Sage independently of its editors/editorial board, without their prior knowledge or acceptance. Critics have pointed out that this is not the first time accusations of this sort have been leveled at Sage. In 2009, political scientists charged that the editor of Political Theory was replaced unilaterally and unfairly. Sage was forced to apologize, admitting that \\"whatever\\" they had done \\"was done without consulting the scholars on the editorial board of the journal\\". Critics also argue that the pro-corporate/management stance of GRONEN stands in stark contrast to the work of previous O&E; editors and writers, many of whom tended strongly to emphasize the role of corporate power in perpetuating environmental degradation. In a statement published in October 2012, 25 members of the editorial board of O&E; resigned in protest of the transition.

Santa Monica, California January 27, 1958) is an American architect, educator and author. Founding partner of Holt Hinshaw Pfau Jones, in 1987 and then Jones, Partners: Architecture in 1993, Jones is a leading architectural voice of his generation, advocating for a continuing appreciation of the physical side of technology within a world increasingly enamored of the virtual. For most of his career this has taken the form of an overt fascination with mechanical expression, both static and moving, and his designs have been celebrated for their \\"engaging operability‚Äù and humor. In his early writings he focused on making the case for the appropriateness of mechanical form in architecture, but his later essays have also taken on more fundamental disciplinary questions, particularly with respect to the growing hegemony of digital design. Biography Jones attended the United States Military Academy at West Point from 1976-78 where he achieved academic distinction, being named a ‚Äúdistinguished cadet‚Äù or ‚Äústarman.‚Äù From West Point Jones transferred to the University of California at Berkeley, from which he graduated in 1980, receiving and AB ‚Äúwith Highest Honors,‚Äù and giving the student commencement address. This speech was a joint effort of Jones and several of his classmates. Together they had gathered samples of the graffiti for which the College of Environmental Design‚Äôs Wurster Hall was famous at the time, and Jones read the sometimes scatological collection on this august occasion in a twenty-minute monologue. Jones next attended the Graduate School of Design at Harvard University. After producing a thesis that offered a critical homage to Le Corbusier‚Äôs Unite d‚ÄôHabitation, Jones received a Master of Architecture with Distinction in 1984. In his final semester at the GSD Jones served as a teaching assistant for the first of Peter Eisenman‚Äôs three studios there, and he joined Eisenman‚Äôs office, Eisenman/Robertson after graduating. Jones spent three years at Eisenman‚Äôs office, working on the Traveler‚Äôs Insurance Building in Long Island and the Wexner Center at OSU. While at Eisenman‚Äôs office, Jones won the ‚ÄúRome Prize,‚Äù which took him to Rome for a year as a Fellow at the American Academy in Rome. HHPJ Upon returning to the United States from Rome, Jones moved to San Francisco where, with his partner Peter Pfau (like many young New York architects, they moonlighted from day jobs with their famous employers, doing competitions and the rare small remodels as \\"Pfau Jones\\" before Jones had gone to Rome) he joined Paul Holt and Marc Hinshaw in the new firm Holt Hinshaw Pfau Jones. As the partner-in-charge of design at HHPJ, Jones was responsible for the design of the projects that established the firm‚Äôs international reputation for technologically inspired work, including the Astronaut's Memorial at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the Paramount Studios Film and Tape Archive, the San Jose Repertory Theater, and the Right Away Redi-Mix dispatch and batch facility. In addition, Jones authored several well known competition designs, including US Pavilion, Expo 92 for Seville, Spain, and the New Akropolis Museum, Athen, Greece (so notorious that the jurors voted to keep it out of the competition book of all the entries), and the Columbus Convention Center, in which Jones‚Äô firm of youngsters competed against Eisenman‚Äôs office and Michael Graves office. Eisenman won the competition. All told, the work of Jones during this period racked up 8 Progressive Architecture awards, as well as numerous publications and exhibitions. J,P:A In 1993 Jones started his own firm, Jones, Partners: Architecture, in San Francisco; in 1997 the entire firm moved down to El Segundo in Southern California. This firm included then-spouse Dora Epstein Jones, partner, Doug Jackson, and project architects, James Rhee and Randolph Ruiz. Important buildings completed by the new firm include the Zimmer Plaza stair, a structural tour de force at the University of Cincinnati, the Confluence Point Bridges and Interpretive Center in San Jose, and the UCLA Chiller Plant and Campus Facilities Offices, as well as a number of residences around Southern California. The office also completed a number of competitions, including the Grand Egyptian Museum, Queensland Gallery of Modern Art, and the Royal Danish Theater and installations, such as the ‚ÄúShuffle‚Äù project, installed in the SCI-Arc gallery, in which several columns suspended from bridge cranes rearranged themselves throughout the course of the exhibit to demonstrate space-defining effects.Southern California Institute of Architecture Gallery : Shuffle: an Experiment in the Mechanics of Spatial Affect In 1995 Jones and his firm began a study of the use of ISO standard shipping containers in design, with his project for air-delivered mountain cabins for the high Sierras. This eventually led to the development of the PRO/con or PROgram CONtainer system, debuted at the Hammer Museum in 1999. This system overcomes the limited repertoire of spaces available in container-based design (CBD) by interpolating conventional construction in the spaces between widely separated containers, using the containers as structural supports, rather than merely enclosure. The firm received a patent for this PRO/dek system, which modifies high density movable storage systems to support programmed activities in a space-saving way. Jones has taught at various schools of architecture in the United States, including Harvard, Columbia, Princeton, IIT, Ohio State, UCLA, Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc)Southern California Institute of Architecture Website and UC Berkeley. Since 2015, Jones has been teaching at USC‚Äôs School of Architecture, where he was named Architecture Discipline Head and Director of the Graduate Architecture program. Work Jones has designed a number of important buildings, but he is equally known for his ideas about technology and the discipline of architecture. The character of his work has been unusually consistent over the course of his career, maintaining throughout a general orientation to the forms and patterns of technology. Ranging from straightforward, or ‚Äúclassic‚Äù modernism to a very exuberant form of technological exhibitionism that has been called ‚Äúhigh tech,‚Äù but which Jones calls simply ‚Äúmechanality,‚Äù the work can be considered, in his words, ‚Äúmachines for‚Ä¶‚Äù echoing the famous phrase of Le Corbusier that the house is a ‚Äúmachine for dwelling.‚Äù The work has exhibited humor at times. Understandably, the more overt examples of this humor has been found more often in the theoretical projects than the built work, but the built work has taken some license in challenging conventions in a wry way, such as the ‚Äúdance‚Äù of mechanical screens at the UCLA Chiller Plant or ‚Äúfake‚Äù sky at the Paramount Studios Film and Tape Archive. Jones‚Äô ‚Äúsouped up‚Äù Chaise, in the collection of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, ‚Äúhot rods‚Äù Le Corbusier and Charlotte Perriand‚Äôs famous ‚Äúchaise longue a relage continu.‚Äù Jones has introduced elements of cartooning into the published work of the office, and has penned a comic series for the publication ANY. Important Buildings and projects designed by Jones include the Astronaut's Memorial (1991), UCLA Chiller Plant and Campus Facilities Offices 'Boss' Design: A Los Angeles Sketchbook New York Times (1994), San Jose Repertory Theater (1996), the NYTimes Capsule competition finalist (1999) and Sub-‚Äòburb 2025 House of the Future, for Time Magazine (2000). What Will Our Houses Look Like? Time Magazine Ideas Jones has written extensively on a variety of topics not directly related to the particular buildings of the office. His interests have centered on either technology‚Äîits place or role in society, its relation to architecture‚Äîand the discipline of architecture, particularly as it has been affected by new advances in digital design technology. Most of the writings by Jones, and partners, Doug Jackson and Dora Epstein Jones, have been collected in the two monograph volumes that cover the work of J,P:A, Instrumental Form (1997) and El Segundo (2007). Jones continues to contribute to various publications related to architecture, such as Log and Harvard Design Magazine. During the 1990s Jones contributed a regular cartoon feature called ‚ÄúThe Nelsons‚Äù to ANY magazine, a retrospective for which was recently held at the LA Forum, LA Forum for Architecture and Urban Design : Pamphlet 6 resulting in the publication of the collected series as Meet the Nelsons (2010). Jones used this medium to lambast the critical establishment of the time, for which ANY magazine was a leading platform. SOUPING UP The term ‚Äúsouping up‚Äù appears often in his writings and lectures. The term originated in the hot rod culture of Southern California. Jones uses it to name a process of upgrading or enhancing an architectural type or program, using more advanced technology or more adventurous form. He relates this process to the way in which a jalopy is turned into a hot rod; in its early form he emphasizes its lower tech ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù roots, contrasting it with the ‚Äúhaute tech‚Äù way a Ferrari might be designed. [Instrumental Form, 109] In later writings he talks about it more from the standpoint of its inherent respect for the original object, in order to separate it from the critical practices of ‚Äúdeconstructivism,‚Äù which depend to some extent on a more violent treatment of their ‚Äúhosts.‚Äù [El Segundo, 307] The ‚Äúsouping up‚Äù technique, which Jones also sees as offering a critique of the meaninglessness of the ‚Äúform finding‚Äù operations of ‚Äúdiagram‚Äù architecture and the negativity of conventional critical architecture, has been used in many of the buildings that he has designed. Indeed, he has called the Astronaut's Memorial a souped up version of the Viet Nam Veterans Memorial (by Maya Lin 1982). TECHNOLOGY AS MEANS TO ENGAGEMENT Jones often refers to the work of Martin Heidegger in his writings and lectures, but far from being critical of technology, as Heidegger is usually considered to be, Jones champions another reading, which grows from the philosopher‚Äôs claim that ‚Äútechnology is a way of revealing.‚Äù Indeed, Jones often quotes Heidegger as saying that ‚Äútechnology teases nature into unhiddenness,‚Äù though this may be a misreading or confusion with the sentiments of Francis Bacon‚Äôs ‚Äúnature reveals itself under the vexations of art‚Ä¶‚Äù From this, though, Jones takes license to understand technology positively as a lens through which the world is viewed, and that as such the design of that lens might enhance engagement with that world. So rather than seeing technology as blocking direct experience of Being and nature, as Heidegger does, Jones sees technology as a means to more direct experience. DISCIPLINE Jones has been vocal about the danger he thinks the new, very popular digital design technology may pose to the discipline in its heedless rush to newness and difference. Drafting from the influential work on discipline by Dora Epstein Jones, he advocates instead a focus on ‚Äúexcellence,‚Äù quoting Mies van der Rohe‚Äôs statement that he ‚Äúwould rather be good than interesting.‚Äù He points out that the standards that architecture has maintained over its history are best suited to judgments of excellence, rather than novelty, dismissing newness as merely a chronological state. Jones criticizes what he sees as a common logical mistake in confusing simple newness with progress. Progress, he says, implies improvement rather than mere difference, but judging improvement entails understanding goodness as well as difference. Architectural goodness is the territory of the discipline. Jones claims that the digital processes popular in the field by the late ‚Äòaughts will lead to a value system more appropriate to the engineer, for whom goodness is something computed, or quantitatively measured, because the highest values are associated with efficiency and efficacy. In contrast, he says, architecture distinguishes itself as interested in everything other or beyond those: expression, the ineffable, the will.

Without imagining they were on the verge of securing international fame with the film cabaret series performed by Ninon Sevilla, the Calderon Brothers contracted to Emilio Fern√°ndez to direct this musical melodrama that would be more intense and exacerbated that Sal√≥n Mexico (1948), the previous raid of \\"El Indio\\" into the cabaret environments of the Mexican capital. As in Salon Mexico, Victimas del Pecado demonstrated the joy of the director in a very particular direct scenes that take place in the cabaret. Also, the director does not hide his love of uplifting moral, nor can he avoid some moments of unintentional comedy as one in which the \\"Pachuco\\" Rodolfo Acosta shows his ability to speak more than one language while teaching him how to walk with style to a French prostitute. Despite its considerable shortcomings, Victimas del pecado has kept pace in the filmography of \\"El Indio\\" Fern√°ndez and the passage of time has not been treated so poorly. Figueroa's photography continues to be splendid and as representative of the filmography of Ninon Sevilla is important to note that the film won an unprecedented success in France and Belgium, where he was known as Quartier interdit (Forbidden Neighborhood or Hell's Kitchen).V√≠ctimas del pecado in the page of the Mexican Cinema of the ITESM Ninon was unsurpassed as the flower that falls in the mud, the star that travels in rotten environments, even though she retains a heart of gold for delivery to a pariah, a hero or a stranger which a past unknown.

It was described as a political novel that recreated the diverse culture of the Philippines through the presentation of an allegorical Philippine history. Characters The main characters of this work of fiction by Rosca are Eliza Hansen, Adrian Banyaga, Anna Villaverde, and Colonel Amor. The three youths ‚Äì Hansen, Banyaga, and Villaverde ‚Äì represented three ‚Äúfaces of Manila‚Äù. Hansen is a vendor of \\"special favors\\" catering to politicians. Banyaga is a son of a prominent and well-connected family. Villaverde was a dissident who had recently been tortured. The ancestry the three is a mixture of ethnic Filipino, Malaysian, Chinese and Caucasian origins. Hansen was also playing the role of \\"matchmaker\\" between Banyaga and Villaverde Colonel Amor is Villaverde's interrogator, the lover and admirer of Hansen, and the seeker of Banyaga's political connections. Plot Hansen, Banyaga, and Villaverde went to an island known as the Island of K in the Philippines to participate in a festival. Villaverde got in touch with radicals planning to activate explosives during the festival in order to assassinate The Commander, a name used as an indirect reference to Ferdinand Marcos. The assassination attempt that would end Marcos's presidency and dictatorship failed. Author Ninotchka Rosca (born in the Philippines in 1946) is a Filipina feminist, author, journalist and human rights activist. Ninotchka Rosca is described as, \\"one of the major players in the saga of Filipina American writers\\". During the political instability during Ferdinand Marcos's rule she was arrested and held at a detention center for six months. She then spent sometime in exile in America. Much of her work is taken from her experiences during her imprisonment. Her short stories have been included in several collections including, the 1986 Best 100 Short Stories in the U.S. compiled by Raymond Carver and the Missouri Review Anthology. Her 1993 book Twice Blessed won the American Book Award. Background The Philippine festival referred to in Rosca's State of War have similarities with the yearly \\"Mardi Gras\\" held on Panay Island. However, the festival was used by Rosca as a literary instrument to present the \\"revolutionary theme\\" of the novel. Rosca's State of War was also a narrative description of the effects of colonialism to the Filipinos' national identity. State of war shows women continuing their struggle in years of colonization against generations of, \\" rape, violence, and oppresion.\\" State of War is written with nostalgia for the pre-contact days of a strong female presence in Filipino society. Other reviews also reveal that Rosca uses an, \\"intricate interplay of discourses on sexuality and (post)colonialism.\\" It also traced the ancestry of the principal characters during Spanish and American colonialism in the Philippines. The personal memories of the main characters was a recollection of a \\"state of war\\" in the Philippines during Marcos's regime that failed to become a true revolution.

The book's narrative is divided evenly between two boys named Will Grayson, with Green having written all of the chapters for one and Levithan having written the chapters for the other, presented in an alternating chapter fashion. One boy is referred to with a capitalized letter at the start of his name, while the other is referred to in all lower case letters. The novel debuted on The New York Times children's best-seller list after its release and remained there for three weeks. It was the first LGBT-themed young adult novel to make it to that list. Collaboration In designing the plot for the book, the two authors decided to split it evenly in half. John Green wrote all the odd-numbered chapters (capitalized Will Grayson) while David Levithan wrote all the even-numbered chapters (lower case will grayson). This also held true for the main characters' names, with Levithan choosing the given name and Green the surname. The only plot they decided on together was the fact that the two characters would meet at some point in the novel and that their meeting would have a tremendous effect on their lives. After this decision, they separately wrote the first chapter for their half and then shared them with each other. After sharing, they then \\"knew immediately it was going to work\\", as stated by Levithan. Structure The story is told from two different perspectives, through both Will Grayson 1 and Will Grayson 2. When reading the odd-numbered chapters, the reader sees high school through the eyes of a heterosexual teenager, Will Grayson 1, who mostly believes in shutting up. When reading the even-numbered chapters, the reader sees high school through the eyes of a depressed gay teenager, Will Grayson 2. Though there are two separate characters speaking, the story remains the same from start to finish. As the story progresses, the perspectives do, however, blend together into one clear and cohesive storyline, rather than two separate plot lines, within the same high school story, told by two different characters. At the beginning of the story, it is clear to distinguish between two completely different voices between the chapters; the reader is able to decipher when Will Grayson 1 is taking center stage when he talks about the girl that he's been crushing on, Jane Turner. Will Grayson 1's chapters are told with proper punctuation and capitalization, whereas Will Grayson 2's chapters are filled with more vulgarity, though Will Grayson 1 is just as vulgar and crude as Will Grayson 2 is. Will Grayson 2's chapters are filled with little character scripts of both casual and digital conversations that he has with his mom, his friend Maura (who is also attracted to him both platonically and romantically), and his crush, at the beginning of the story, Isaac, who goes by the alias of boundbydad via instant messaging. As the story progresses, the stories of Will Grayson 1 and Will Grayson 2 become entangled, carrying strong themes of young love, teen angst and rebellion, and self-discovery throughout the book until the ending scene. Dialogue With the story's strongest focus being the musical about Tiny Cooper, Tiny Dancer, the chapters that are enumerated for Will Grayson 2 all follow a written dialogue that echoes that of a script, with character names preceding a colon before their dialogue is written in the text. The conversations before Will Grayson 2 meets Will Grayson 1 echo that of a chatroom instant message, with usernames and special nicknames for the characters preceding each of the conversation pieces. The text is written this way to help the reading audience relate to the happenings of the story better, by familiarizing the way that each chunk of dialogue is received. Synopsis The novel follows two boys who both have the name Will Grayson. The first Will, whose POV always has correct capitalization, is described as trying to live his life without being noticed. This is complicated by the fact that his best friend, Tiny Cooper, described as \\"the world's largest person who is really, really gay\\" and \\"the world's gayest person who is really, really large\\", is not the type to go around unnoticed. Tiny is also throughout the novel trying to create an autobiographical musical, which further draws attention to himself and everyone around him. The other Will Grayson, whose POV never has capitalization, goes through his life without anything good to hold on to besides an online relationship with someone who goes by the name Isaac. Intent on meeting up with Isaac, Will Grayson sets up an encounter one night in Chicago but eventually finds out that Isaac was invented by a girl named Maura (who is also his peer in his daily school life).Green, John.

Characters=Main characters *': First protagonist of the story. He lives in Chicago, Illinois. His point of view is seen in the odd-numbered chapters, where the entirety of the text shows proper capitalization. He is the first, and only, male straight-identifying member of the Gay Straight Alliance. He is a fan of the band Neutral Milk Hotel. Jane Turner is his love interest; Tiny Cooper is his best friend. His character is written by John Green.Green, John. Will Grayson, Will Grayson. Penguin Group, 2010, p. 257Green, John. Will Grayson, Will Grayson. Penguin Group, 2010, p. 292 *': Second protagonist of the story. He lives in Naperville, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. His point of view is seen in the even-numbered chapters, where the entirety of the text is always lowercased. He has a crush on Isaac, a boy that he met online; the two of them communicate via instant messaging, in secrecy, under the pseudonym grayscale and boundbydad. Meets Tiny Cooper through Will Grayson 1. He is perhaps a more realistic character than the typical stock gay character. At least at the beginning of the novel, he is angry, and vulgar. Therefore, he is more relatable to teenagers, particularly LGBT teenagers. Will Grayson 2 has been diagnosed with depression, taking antidepressants and claiming, early on, that he is constantly \\"torn between killing himself and killing everyone around him\\". He is not close with any major character in his school, though he does interact with his not-so-secret admirer, Maura.Green, John. Will Grayson, Will Grayson. Penguin Group, 2010 p. 149Green, John. Will Grayson, Will Grayson. Penguin Group, 2010, p. 215 Secondary characters *': Will Grayson 1's best friend in school. He is described as being a large flamboyant homosexual football player who runs through love interests swiftly. He is the president of the Gay-Straight Alliance at school. He is described as \\"very gay, and very proud\\". He meets Will Grayson 2 through Will Grayson 1. Though the book may be titled after both Will Graysons, Tiny becomes the primary focus of the story.Green, John. Will Grayson, Will Grayson. Penguin Group, 2010, p. 247 *': Friend of Tiny and Will Grayson 1. She is also a member of the Gay-Straight Alliance at school, and adores Neutral Milk Hotel. She is Will Grayson 1's love interest. *': A goth girl who is attracted to Will Grayson 2. She is one of the few people at his school with whom he interacts. She is described by Will Grayson 2 as \\"unrealistically friendly\\", because she pays \\"too much attention\\" to him when he describes himself as uninteresting. Maura poses as the online love interest of Will Grayson 2, Isaac, to gain Will's attention, admiration, and further, affection. Themes *Friendship Friendship plays an interesting role in each of the characters' own personal story. For the majority of his story, Will Grayson 1 and Tiny Cooper have a scattered friendship, with visible cracks from the mistakes that Will has made in his past. As for Will Grayson 2 and Maura, their friendship reflects more of a touch-and-go relationship, picking up and leaving off whenever Will decides to consider Maura as his friend. With the blossoming relationship between Jane and Will Grayson 1, soon Will and Tiny begin to drift apart. The role of friendship creates a series of changes, breaks, differences, and conflict throughout each of the protagonists' stories. *Music Music is referenced to throughout the story with Neutral Milk Hotel, a band that brings together all of the main characters in the book and becomes entangled in each of their stories. While the music groups, both real and fictional, do not become characters themselves in the story, the music that they create becomes relevant to each of their personalities. While both obscure Jane and nonchalant Will Grayson 1 both share a common interest with the alternative band Neutral Milk Hotel, Tiny Cooper, the fabulously flamboyant character of the story, fancies big, bold Broadway-showtunes and music that becomes main-streamed as iconic pop culture.

He was assigned a female gender at birth but lived as a man. Harry had two long term relationships with women, both of which lasted over 20 years. In 1838 and 1859 his gender variance became the subject of local and national newspaper articles in which he was described as a 'man-woman‚Äô and a ‚Äòfemale husband‚Äô. Today Harry Stokes‚Äôs life can be seen in the framework of LGBT history ‚Äî he can be viewed as a trans man, or as a cross dressing lesbian. \\" Early life Born in Doncaster around 1799, Harry Stokes was assigned a female gender at birth. He assumed a male identity at a young age, and undertook a builder‚Äôs apprenticeship in Bawtry. Newspaper articles published in 1838 report that Harry married his first wife in Sheffield in about 1816. There is a record of a Henry Stoake marrying an Ann Hants at Sheffield Cathedral in January 1817.  1820s and 1830s In the 1820s and 30s Harry Stokes built up a successful bricklaying firm in Manchester. At its peak he employed eight men and an apprentice, with his wife keeping the company accounts. He was a well respected tradesman specialising in chimney and flue construction. From 1824 he is listed in Manchester trade directories as a bricklayer. The 1824 Pigot & Dean's Manchester and Salford Directory lists Henry Stokes living at 13 Potter Street. From 1828 to 1830 he lived at 11 Cumberland Street, and from 1832 to 1838 at 21 Cumberland Street. The area where Harry and his wife lived is now Spinningfields‚Äì Cumberland Street was on the site where The Avenue is today. In the late 1820s and early 1830s Harry worked shifts as a special constable policing events where there were large gatherings of people with the potential for trouble, such as protest marches and demonstrations. In the Public Officials section of the 1829 Pigot‚Äôs trade directory Harry is listed as a Special Constable for the 13th District of Manchester, the Old Quay District. Then in the 1832 Pigot‚Äôs Manchester Directory, he is registered as a Special Constable for the 11th District, St. Peter‚Äôs District. 1838 press reports and ballads In April 1838, after twenty-two years of marriage, Harry‚Äôs wife approached a lawyer for advice on getting a formal separation and a maintenance settlement as he was withholding housekeeping money, getting drunk and ill-treating her. She advised the shocked lawyer that her husband was not a man, but a woman, and \\"also stated, that she accidentally made the discovery of the sex of her husband as much as two or three years back; but that she had kept the secret till the present time.\\" Harry Stokes was examined by a police surgeon who \\"gave a certificate declaring that the individual in question was a woman\\". The Manchester Guardian stated ‚ÄúThis woman-man, who, for probably more than five-and-twenty years, has succeeded in concealing her sex, and in pursuing a trade of more than ordinarily masculine and hazardous description, with a degree of skill and ability which had led to her establishment of a good business in this town‚Äù. Although news articles stated that ‚Äúher real name is believed to be Harriet Stoakes‚Äù, there is no evidence that Stokes ever confirmed his name assigned at birth to be Harriet. Harry Stokes‚Äôs gender became the subject of gossip and ridicule around Manchester. Ballads were composed about him and sung in the streets. There is some evidence that the ballads told the tale of an ill-fated, one-day marriage to a barmaid called Betsy. On the wedding day Harry managed to play the part of a groom well enough, but on the wedding night there was a terrible row and he was charged with assault and sentenced to two months in jail. At his court hearing Betsy declared that she wouldn‚Äôt live with her husband because he was really a woman. 1839 ‚Äì 1859 After separating from his first wife, Harry set up home with a widow called Francis Collins, a woman who had worked as a barmaid in his local beerhouse. The couple moved to Salford for two years and then in 1840 they established a beerhouse at numbers 3 ‚Äì 5 Quay Street, Manchester. John Heaton who was Francis‚Äôs son from her first marriage was later reported as saying that he \\"always regarded Harry as his stepfather, and his mother assumed the name of Stokes and passed as his wife.\\" In the United Kingdom Census 1841 Harry Stokes and Francis Stokes are registered as living on Quay Street. In the 1841 Pigot & Slater‚Äôs trade directory Francis Collins is listed as a beer retailer at 3 Quay Street, whereas Harry is listed in the 1843 edition. By 1846 Harry and Francis had moved to a beerhouse at 22 Camp Street called the Pilgrims Rest which was registered in the name of Francis‚Äôs son John Heaton. By 1852 Harry, Francis and John had moved their beerhouse to 28 Camp Street. Harry is listed in the 1855 and 1856 Slater‚Äôs trade directories as a bricklayer at 28 Camp Street. Around 1856 Harry moved to 11 Richmond Street Salford with Francis and John Heaton. Death inquest 15 October 1859 a body was found in the River Irwell at Mode Wheel, bolt upright in the water with a top hat still jammed firmly on his head. The corpse was taken to the Swann Inn, Pendlebury where an inquest was held. A juror recognised the body as that of Harry Stokes, advising that he was \\"not a man but a woman\\". Harry‚Äôs body was inspected by two women who confirmed it was that of a woman. The inquest into Harry‚Äôs death was reported in the local press, with headlines such as ‚ÄòA WOMAN PASSING AS A MAN FOR FORTY YEARS‚Äô ‚Äì the Manchester Examiner; and ‚ÄòHARRY STOKES THE MAN WOMAN‚Äô ‚Äì The Salford weekly News. The stories were reprinted in papers across the country. The inquest verdict was ‚ÄòFound drowned ‚Äì supposed suicide'. Harry's death was entered in the General Register Office under the name Harriett Stokes, . While there is evidence the local community used the name Harriet to refer to Harry Stokes, there is no evidence that he ever confirmed his birth name to be Harriet. News reports on Harry Stokes‚Äô death inquest appear to show that his gender variance was generally known and accepted by the working class community he was part of. The Manchester Examiner reported: ‚ÄúHarriet Taylor, who lives in the neighbourhood, said she knew Stokes well. He was a bricksetter. The proper name was Harriet Stokes, but he went by the name of Harry Stokes. Some years ago Stokes married a woman in Manchester. They lived together as man and wife, and kept a beershop in Quay Street, Manchester. Several of the jury recollected the case, and that ballads were composed and sung in the streets on its being known that the supposed man was a woman.‚Äù Legacy Harry Stokes's life was dramatised in a play by Abi Hynes commissioned by the UK's LGBT History Month entitled 'Mister Stokes - The Man-Woman of Manchester'. The play was performed at the People's History Museum in February 2016 as part of their celebrations of LGBT History Month. Since 2016 Harry Stokes has featured in an LGBT+ history trail within the main galleries of People's History Museum. In 2018, BBC Sounds released Ballad of Harry Stokes, a podcast exploring Stokes‚Äôs life. Narrated by actress Annie Wallace, and featuring a ballad by theatre maker Krishna Istha, the podcast was part of the Gaychester series exploring the LGBT+ history of Manchester. In 2019 Stokes‚Äôs work as a special constable was featured in an exhibit on specials at Greater Manchester Police Museum.

It is located near Wisconsin Rapids. History The memorial was signed into law in 1996 by Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson. It is funded completely by tax deductible donations and no tax money was used for its construction. On October 3, 2003, the Wisconsin Legislature designated the week in which October 8 falls as Fire Prevention week. The Saturday of that week is designated the Wisconsin State Firefighters Memorial Day; the week also commemorates the Peshtigo Fire and Great Chicago Fire from 1871. Location It is located at Ben Hansen Park on Wisconsin Highway 54 / Wisconsin Highway 73 just south of Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin and north of Port Edwards, Wisconsin along the Wisconsin River. Locations considered for the memorial included Milwaukee (the state's largest population) and Madison; it was placed at Wisconsin Rapids to be near the center of the state for the easiest possible access for state residents. Memorial The centerpiece of the park is a statue of three life-sized firefighters engaged in a rescue situation. One firefighter is dragging a disabled firefighter with another nearby ready to help. A memorial Final Alarm and Roll Call Ceremony is held each October to honor fallen firefighters in Wisconsin. There are benches for reflection and the American flag flies over the park. A tower with a firefighter's bell commemorates the bell that firefighters historically used to signal an alarm and a fire call. The memorial has a smaller bronze statue that it brings to funerals for firefighters who died in the line of duty. Fundraising Sign at the Memorial Governor Jim Doyle signed a bill that allows Wisconsin income tax filers to donate money to help fund the memorial. The group has held an annual motorcycle bike ride since 2004 to raise money for a planned visitor's center and to raise money to maintain the center.

It excludes engagements of the California Campaign in areas of The Californias north of the Baja California Peninsula. The objective of the campaign was to secure the Baja Peninsula of Mexico, and to blockade/capture west-coast ports of Mexico‚Äîespecially Mazatlan, a major port-of-entry for imported supplies. The resistance of Mexican forces to the north in the Los Angeles area and the lack of ships, soldiers and logistical support prevented an early occupation of the peninsula and the west-coast Mexican seaports. The U.S. Navy attempted blockades of the ports three times before being able to successfully blockade and/or occupy them. Following an easy initial occupation and the capitulation of La Paz by Governor Col. Francisco Palacios Miranda,Note: the Baja California peninsula had its own governor in 1847 but had been, since the 1836 Siete Leyes re-organization, part of the same Department of The Californias as the formerly-separate Alta (upper) California. loyalist residents met, declared Miranda a traitor, and rose in revolt. Under a new governor, Mauricio Castro Cota, and then under the leadership of Manuel Pineda Munoz (who defended Mulege from American landings), the loyalists attempted to expel the Americans from La Paz and San Jos√© del Cabo. Pineda was eventually captured and the Mexican army under Cota finally defeated at Todos Santos but only after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that ended the war returned captured regions south of San Diego to Mexico. Richard W. Amero, Mexican American War in Baja California, The Journal of San Diego History, SAN DIEGO HISTORICAL SOCIETY QUARTERLY, Winter 1984, Volume 30, Number 1 First Blockade of the West Coast of Mexico Following the July‚ÄìAugust 1846 campaign led by the Commander of the U.S. Navy Pacific Squadron, Commodore Robert F. Stockton proclaimed United States control of northern regions of Las Californias (known separately before 1836 as Alta California), on August 17, 1846. On August 19, Commander Stockton ordered Joseph B. Hull, commander of the USS Warren, to blockade Mazatlan. Samuel F. Dupont, commander of the second class sloop-of- war Cyane, was ordered to blockade San Blas (about 125 miles south of Mazatlan). Stockton intended to seize Acapulco, and use it as a base for a joint Army-Navy expedition into Mexico. On September 2, 1846 the Cyane captured two Mexican vessels in the harbor then a landing party spiked 34 cannons in the port of San Blas. On September 7, the Warren seized the Mexican brig Malek Adhel at Mazatlan. In an August 17 proclamation, Stockton had claimed United States control of the Baja Peninsula. To make good on this claim, Commander Dupont then sailed north to La Paz (on the Gulf of California), seized nine small pearl-fishing boats and secured a promise of neutrality from Colonel Francisco Palacios Miranda, governor of Baja California. On October 1, the Cyane seized two schooners at Loreto (about 150 miles north of La Paz). On October 7, the Cyane shelled Guaymas on the mainland after Colonel Antonio Campazano refused to surrender it. A boarding party from the Cyane seized the brig Condor in that port but, finding it unusable, burned it. The revolt of Californians in Los Angeles (September 27, 1846) prevented the resupply and replacement of the blockade force who could not maintain station without them. When news of the revolt came the Warren left for San Francisco. On November 13, the Cyane followed ending the first blockade of Mexico's west coast after about four weeks. Second Blockade of the West Coast of Mexico, Occupation of Baja California Sur On December 24, 1846, Secretary of the Navy John Y. Mason ordered Stockton to impose an effective blockade on the west coast of Mexico. Its object was to prevent the enemy from getting munitions and other supplies and to make possible the landing of American soldiers. The Battle of La Mesa January 9, 1847 was the last armed resistance to the United States conquest of California. The conquest and annexation of was confirmed with the signing of the Treaty of Cahuenga by US Army Lieutenant-Colonel John C. Fr√©mont and Mexican General Andr√©s Pico on January 13, 1847. With the fate of California settled, on January 11, 1847, Secretary of War William L. Marcy instructed General Stephen Watts Kearny, commanding the Army forces in California, to make the American hold on the Californias so secure that none could successfully challenge it. However, at the time Kearny had only one company of troops (about 100 men), and awaited reinforcements. On February 3, Commodore Stockton, in San Diego ordered Commander John B. Montgomery, on the Portsmouth, to reestablish the blockade at Mazatlan and to raise the United States flag at San Jose del Cabo, La Paz, Pichilinque, and Loreto. However, resistance to the Americans was arising in the region. On February 15, a council meeting at Santa Anita (about 20 miles north of San Jose del Cabo) declared Governor Miranda a traitor and named Mauricio Castro Cota, of San Jose del Cabo, as his successor. Cota then attempted to raise a company of volunteers, but without success. On February 17, Montgomery imposed a blockade on Mazatlan, despite British objections. Montgomery then sailed for the Baja California peninsula, seizing San Jose del Cabo and San Lucas, but without sufficient forces did not set up garrisons there. On April 14, Montgomery accepted Colonel Miranda's surrender of La Paz. The articles of capitulation granted, to residents of Baja California who accepted the terms, the rights of United States citizens, along with retention of their own officials and laws. Fortunately for Kearny, the means to occupy Baja California Sur arrived at San Francisco, in March and April, in the form of the 1st Regiment of New York Volunteers. Acting under blockade instructions issued by the new commander of the Pacific Squadron, Commodore James Biddle, Commodore William Shubrick in the Independence, with the Cyane on April 26, relieved Montgomery and the Portsmouth, and resumed the blockade of Mazatlan April 27, 1847. On May 30, General Kearny sent U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Henry S. Burton, with Companies A and B of the New York Volunteers to La Paz on the storeship Lexington. Burton was to take possession of that part of the peninsula and uphold United States' laws. On July 15, 115 New York Volunteers landed at La Paz. Burton reinstated the civil government on condition it remained loyal to the United States. Residents of La Paz, in turn, entertained the Volunteers. On June 3, after the Independence left for San Francisco, the Cyane was the only U. S. Navy warship on the west coast of Mexico. To provide the friendly inhabitants of La Paz and San Jose del Cabo with a semblance of protection, Commander Dupont sailed the Cyane back and forth between San Jose del Cabo and Mazatlan, which broke the blockade. Upon meeting the Cyane at San Jose del Cabo, on June 20, Montgomery, of the Portsmouth, became aware that Mazatlan was open to commerce. After conferring with Dupont, Montgomery returned June 28 to San Francisco to ask Biddle for instructions while the Cyane sailed to Hawaii for supplies. The second blockade had failed.  Third Blockade of West Coast of Mexico, Revolt of Baja California Sur  Meanwhile, to the north of La Paz, at Loreto and Mulege, local priest Gabriel Gonzalez Pereyra of Todos Santos and Padre Vicente Sotomayor of Comond√∫ incited rancheros to join the resistance to the Americans. In late September, Captain Manuel Pineda, of the Mexican army, arrived in Muleg√© with officers and soldiers from Guaymas and began recruiting rancheros for his command. On August 10, 1847, U.S. Navy Commodore Shubrick had succeeded Commodore Biddle in command of the Pacific Squadron. His first orders were to send the frigate Congress with of sloops-of-war USS Dale and USS Portsmouth to commence a new blockade of Mazatl√°n, Guaymas and San Blas. On October 2, Mexican and local resistance forces led by Captain Pineda prevented a detachment of American forces from USS Dale from capturing the small port of Muleg√©. This alerted the Americans to the serious revolt that was brewing. On October 19 the threat of bombardment of the fort and city of Guaymas by Captain Elie A. F. La Vallette with his USS Congress and the sloop USS Portsmouth led to a secret evacuation of the Mexican garrison and fortress artillery on the night the 19th of November by Col. Antonio Campuzano. Following the morning bombardment of the fort and city, La Vallette landed to take possession, to find the city abandoned by its defenders and most its population. On November 11, 1847, a large Pacific Squadron landing party captured Mazatlan without firing a shot. On November 19‚Äì20, 1847 a land force cooperating with a landing force fought the Skirmish of Palos Prietos and the hard-fought Skirmish of Urias to break up the close blockade of the city by the Mexican commander. Afterward, behind defensive works designed by Henry Wager Halleck defended by a 400-man garrison, the city remained in American hands for the rest of the war, with only a few minor skirmishes with Mexican forces nearby. Meanwhile, in Baja California Sur, on November 16, the Mexican resistance forces under Pineda descended on La Paz, attacking the American garrison and pro-American locals, but were repulsed. The following day at Guaymas, Col. Campuzano attempted to reoccupy Guaymas but was repulsed by a landing party of sailors and marines under Lieutenant W. T. Smith, supported by the guns of the USS Dale. On November 20‚Äì21 the local resistance forces under Jos√© Antonio Mijares were defeated in their attempt to capture San Jos√© del Cabo from the American garrison and pro-American militia. From November 27 ‚Äì December 8, Manuel Pineda besieged La Paz ending in an American victory, when word came of the arrival of the USS Cyane at San Jos√© del Cabo from blockading San Blas. On January 11, 1848, a landing party from the bark USS Whiton\\"' under Lieutenant Frederick Chatard, captured the coastal fort of San Blas and brought off two pieces of artillery and two schooners, one belonging to the custom-house. With no force sufficient to defend it and the port made defenseless, no American occupation of the city took place. A week later, on January 18, Lieutenant Chatard landed a small party at Manzanillo and spiked three large guns defending the port, rendering it defenseless. From January 22 to February 15, Captain Pineda's forces besieged San Jos√© del Cabo. With the garrison nearly starving and low on water, the siege was relieved when the USS Cyane arrived with a relief force under Captain Seymour G. Steele and with part of the garrison under Lieutenant Charles Heywood defeated Pineda, breaking the siege. Soon afterward, Lt. Col. Henry S. Burton marched out against Pineda, surprised and captured him at San Antonio. Burton then marched on Todos Santos where the remaining Mexican forces were gathered under Governor Cota. On March 31, at the Skirmish of Todos Santos, Burton defeated Cota and broke up the remaining Mexican forces, after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was already signed but before word of the March 6th truce had reached him.

It was discovered on 14 September 1998, by astronomers of the Lincoln Near- Earth Asteroid Research at the Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site near Socorro, New Mexico, United States. The asteroid was named for 2008-ISEF awardee Johan Ingemar Bostr√∂m.  Orbit and classification  Bostr√∂m is a non-family from the main belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the central asteroid belt at a distance of 2.2‚Äì3.1 AU once every 4 years and 3 months (1,563 days; semi-major axis of 2.64 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.16 and an inclination of 7¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken by the Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking program at Haleakala Observatory's GEODSS facility on June 1997, or 9 months prior to its official discovery observation.  Physical characteristics = Diameter and albedo  According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Bostr√∂m measures 6.812 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an intermediate albedo of 0.115.  Rotation period  As of 2018, no rotational lightcurve of Bostr√∂m has been obtained from photometric observations. The body's rotation period, pole and shape remain unknown.

Background Gold Heels was bred by Alexander Cassatt at his Chesterbrook Farm in Berwyn, Pennsylvania. He was sired by Cassatt's outstanding runner, The Bard, a son of U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee, Longfellow. Gold Heels was out of the very good race mare Heel- and-Toe. A daughter of four-time Leading sire in North America, Glenelg, the durable Heel-and-Toe made 107 career starts winning 21 times. Racing career=1900: Two-Year-Old season Gold Heels was purchased by William C. Whitney but after racing him a short time at age two, the colt was deemed to have limited potential and in June 1900 was sold for $1,500 to trainer David Sloan, a cousin of future Hall of Fame jockey Tod Sloan. David Sloan raced the colt during the remainder of 1900 in mainly lower class races, finishing the year with five wins from twenty-four starts including the Chappaqua Handicap at Empire City Race Track. Facing financial problems, David Sloan put Gold Heels up for sale and on the advice of trainer, Matthew Allen, he was purchased for $7,000 by the racing partnership of Fred C. McLewee and Diamond Jim Brady. 1901: Three-Year-Old season In 1901, under the conditioning of Matthew Allen, three-year-old Gold Heels won seven of his twelve starts while setting three track records. On June 27 he won the Spindrift Stakes in which he set a new Sheepshead Bay Race Track record for one mile and one furlong on dirt. On July 2 he won the Long Island Handicap at Sheepshead Bay and then on July 25 won the richest race for three-year-olds at Brighton Beach Race Course, the mile and one furlong Seagate Stakes. He followed this up with a ten length victory on September 25, 1901 in the one mile and one furlong Monarch Stakes at Gravesend Race Track. In winning the October 5 Oriental Handicap at Gravesend he set a new track record time for a mile and a quarter on dirt. On October 26, at Morris Park Racecourse, Gold Heels showed he was not only capable at longer distances but a truly outstanding stayer when he won the 2¬º mile Woodlawn Vase in a track record time of 3:56.00. 1902: Four-Year-Old season At age four in 1902, Gold Heels won four of his five starts, setting a stakes record and a world record. With jockey Otto Wonderly aboard, Gold Heels won the June 14 Suburban Handicap at Sheepshead Bay Race Track. Not only did he win what was then America's most prestigious race, he broke the stakes record on an off track while carrying top weight.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vkouAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=tX4FAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5872,5854071&dq;=suburban+handicap&hl;=en On June 28 Gold Heels won the 1 ¬Ω mile Advance Stakes at Sheepshead Bay Race Track and was top-weighted again when he won the July 5 Brighton Handicap at Brighton Beach Race Course in a world record time of 2:03.80 for a mile and a quarter on dirt.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KCIuAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=xn4FAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6822,574713&dq;=gold+heels+brighton+cap&hl;=en For the July 26 Brighton Cup, Gold Heels was again given highweight but still earned the win in the 2¬º mile endurance test. Even though he still won by twenty lengths, near the finish jockey George Odom slowed him to a canter due to an injury that ended his racing career. The New York Times wrote on October 5, 1902 that Gold Heels was the \\"accepted champion of the year\\" and Thoroughbred Heritage selected him as the retrospective American Champion Older Male Horse for that year. Sale and stud career The September 20, 1902, issue of the Chicago Daily Tribune announced that the racing partnership of McLewee and Daly was to be dissolved and on October 4, 1902 Gold Heels was sold at a dispersal auction. Expected to bring $15,000, jockey Winfield O'Connor bought him for only $6,500 then quickly resold the horse to St. Louis, Missouri breeder, E. J. Arnold. At stud, Gold Heels met with little success although Covadonga (b. 1908) became one of the first American-bred horses to be imported to Puerto Rico where he raced with considerable success.

Bang! TV series, as well as for co-founding the weekly Comedy Death-Ray stage show at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in Hollywood. Comedy Death-Ray Radio was formerly broadcast from Southern California's Indie 103 studios, but since the summer of 2010 has been broadcast as part of the Earwolf comedy podcasting network, being recorded in studios owned by the company. Many notable people in the world of comedy, music, television and film have appeared on the podcast, including Paul F. Tompkins, Lauren Lapkus, Jason Mantzoukas, \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic, Aimee Mann, Jon Hamm, Aziz Ansari, Adam Scott, Patton Oswalt, Seth Rogen, Thomas Lennon, Zach Galifianakis, Ben Stiller, David Cross, Bob Odenkirk, St. Vincent, Thomas Middleditch, Ben Schwartz, Sarah Silverman, Amy Poehler, James Adomian, Harris Wittels, Michael Cera, Tim Heidecker, Nick Kroll, Loudon Wainwright III, Matt Besser, Kevin Nealon, and Andy Daly. Comedy Bang! Bang! was also a television series on IFC hosted by Scott Aukerman and featuring in different seasons bandleaders \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic, Reggie Watts and Kid Cudi. History Comedy Death-Ray Radio first aired May 1, 2009, after Aukerman gained permission from Indie 103 to conduct a \\"one-month tryout\\". The first episode's guests were Rob Huebel and Thomas Lennon. During occasions when Aukerman has been unable to host, Paul F. Tompkins, Chris Hardwick, Jimmy Pardo or Jerry Minor (in character as \\"Cyberthug\\") have guest hosted. Although normally produced in Los Angeles, the show has also been taped in Vancouver, Seattle, New York City, Chicago and Austin.ColdTowne Theater Blog: \\"THIS JUST IN! COMEDY DEATH RAY INVADES COLDTOWNE.\\" Name change On the May 15, 2011 \\"Two-year Anniversary\\" podcast, Aukerman announced that the show's name was changing to Comedy Bang Bang: The Podcast. He went on to say that the show had evolved a great deal in its first two years, and he credited his wife Kulap Vilaysack with coming up with the new name. Red Hot Chili Peppers parody In episode 204 (which aired on March 4, 2013), \\"The Pepper Men,\\" guests Jon Daly and Zach Galifianakis professed their love for the rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers. Both claimed to be \\"huge Pepper Men\\" and had written a song in tribute to the band titled \\"Abracadabralifornia\\", which Daly sang using his best Anthony Kiedis imitation. On January 29, 2014, a very official-looking website called www.RHCP2014.com appeared online claiming to have the brand-new Chili Peppers song, \\"Abracadabralifornia\\". The song even featured a layout for the band's upcoming Super Bowl appearance, complete with sponsors' logos. Various people through websites including Twitter and Facebook at first were fooled by the song, although many quickly realized that it was a parody. The song was written and performed by Daly and musician Cyrus Ghahremani. Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith Tweeted his approval of the song. Format and features The podcast begins with a theme song composed and performed by Reggie Watts, followed by the reading of a listener-submitted catchphrase, under the pretense that one will eventually replace the show's original catchphrase, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up, hot dog?‚Äù The show's format mixes conversation between the host and guests with comedy songs and occasionally game segments. Some guests play characters or impersonate certain celebrities, sometimes for the entirety of the episode. The show's most frequent guest Paul F. Tompkins has impersonated celebrities such as rapper Ice-T, directors Garry Marshall and Werner Herzog, actor John C. Reilly, composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, actor Alan Thicke, actor Danny Glover, Cake Boss's Buddy Valastro; other frequent guests such as James Adomian has played public television personality Huell Howser, Jesse Ventura, Paul Giamatti, Christopher Hitchens, actor Gary Busey, celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, politician Bernie Sanders and food critic Merrill Shindler. For the first few months of the program, comedian Doug Benson would semi-regularly call the program and give several \\"8 Words or Less Movie Reviews\\". Occasionally the podcast is taped with a live audience, usually at comedy shows or at festival events. In the last third of the show, Aukerman and his guests will often play one of several improv-style games. Examples of games played include: *\\"Would You Rather?\\", in which the guests are presented with two typically absurd scenarios; following a brief question-and-answer session with answers made up on the spot by Aukerman, the contestants are asked to choose one of the options, with points given after each round. * \\"Riddle Me This\\", in which one person comes up with a question that is the setup for a joke. An example would be \\"What's brown and is often spotted near a fast-food restaurant?\\". The other contestants then come up with answers and vote whose answer was the funniest. *\\"Freestyle Rap Battle/Contest\\", in which the guests take turns performing a freestyle rap. *\\"What Am I Thinking?\\", in which two guests (or Scott) count down together from three and attempt to use word association to say the same word. The following games have been played on the podcast in the past, but not recently: *\\"Jukebox Jury\\", in which Scott and the guests rate songs sent in by listeners as either \\"mustard\\" or \\"pants\\", although the meanings of the ratings is unknown. *\\"Alive or Dead\\", in which Scott gives the guests the name of a celebrity and they must determine if that celebrity is alive or dead. The people in question are usually alive but their fictional deaths are described in a humorous way. *\\"Who Said It?\\", in which guests name the person to whom a given quote is attributed. *\\"Hollywood Facts\\", in which Scott and guests list fake celebrity gossip news. This game has largely been discontinued, however the game's theme music is regularly played when guest Andy Samberg appears on the podcast because Samberg recorded it. Occasionally, guests will present their own features on the show. Examples include: *\\"Harris' Foam/Phone Corner\\", in which Harris Wittels recited jokes, text-messaged to himself, which were deemed unworthy of his stand-up performances, and was ridiculed for his efforts. *\\"New No-Nos\\", in which Paul Rust makes up new rules for life and the world; which he refers to as New No- Nos. Nearly every new rule is a ridiculous idea that can already be accomplished without consequence. *\\"The Solo Bolo Olympic Song Challenge\\", in which Ben Schwartz and Scott sing a myriad of different songs, jingles, and show-tunes, with minimal regard to pitch and rhythm. They ostensibly attempt to seamlessly transition between songs that have some sort of connection to one another. These connections can include being by the same artist, including the same word, or in many cases, having absolutely no relation.

Ford School of Public Policy. He is also the Roy F. and Jean Humphrey Proffitt Professor of Law at the University of Michigan Law School and faculty director of the University of Michigan's Center on Finance, Law, and Policy.  Early life and education  Barr attended Yale College and graduated summa cum laude with honors in history in 1987. At Yale, he won the New Prize for public service and the Gries Prize for his senior history thesis: \\"The Black Consciousness Movement in South Africa.\\" Barr went on to earn his M.Phil. in international relations in 1989 as a Rhodes Scholar at Magdalen College, Oxford. His thesis was on U.S.-Panamanian relations. Barr returned to Yale Law School to earn a J.D. in 1992. He was co-recipient of the AILA Human Rights Award and recipient of the Charles G. Albom Prize for appellate advocacy during his time at Yale Law School. Career in government Upon graduating from Yale in 1992, Barr worked as a law clerk for the Honorable Pierre N.

Governmental relations were established in 1994, four years after Namibia gained independence from South Africa. Israel's ambassador to Namibia, Dov Segev-Steinberg, resides in South Africa. While Namibia does not have an embassy in Israel, it has an honorary consul, Gil Dankner, based in Atlit, with jurisdiction over the Haifa region. History Prior to Namibian independence, Israel's policy towards Namibia was that of official silence. A number of high profile Israeli leaders visited the then occupied territory. Members of the South African administration of Namibia also visited Israel.The Israeli connection: who Israel arms and why by Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi, 1981, page 146 in Google Books * In late 1981, then Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon visited the then South-West Africa, (the annexation of which by South Africa had not been recognized by the UN, which continued to refer to the territory as occupied Namibia) along with South African military officials. As part of Israel's military aid to South Africa, Israeli instructors helped train Angolan rebels, UNITA, in their fight against the MPLA-led government in Angola. * In 1984, Israel's Ambassador to South Africa, Eliyahu Lankin, visited then South West Africa and pledged development aid to South African officials. * In April 1985, the Windhoek Observer reported that South African governmental and developmental officials in charge of administering Namibia would visit Israel to study development projects. Namibia gained independence in 1990 and the two governments opened bilateral relations in 1994. In January 2008, Prime Minister of Namibia Nahas Angula received a fax which claimed to be from the United States House of Representatives. It asked Namibia to vote more favorably for Israel at the United Nations. The United States embassy in Namibia would neither confirm nor deny the authenticity of the letter.Letter from US Congress raises some eyebrows The Namibian, 23 December 2008 In January 2009, during the Gaza War, Namibia condemned Israel, saying, \\"This naked aggression and disproportionate use of force by Israel is unfortunate and only leads to further escalation of violence\\". Namibia does recognise the State of Palestine. Economic relations Israeli companies are heavily invested in Namibia's diamond industry. In 2004, Africa Israel Investments through subsidiary LLD Diamonds, was given 36 concessions worth US$ 180 million by the Namibian government in order to invest in Namibia's diamond industry. As of 2005, LLD Diamonds operated the largest diamond cutting center in Africa. Based in Windhoek, Namibian President Hifikepunye Pohamba called the factory a success story in Namibia's drive to attract Foreign Direct Investment. In January 2008, a chartered Cessna 210 crashed shortly after departing from an airport in Windhoek. The plane, heading to Etosha National Park, killed five Israelis and four Namibians. The Israelis were expatriates working in the diamond industry heading to Etosha for a holiday break, while the Namibians were members of the crew flying the group.Israeli delegations land in Namibia to identify plane crash victims Haaretz, 14 January 2008 Criticism of relations Some organizations in Namibia called for an end to relations with Israel due to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict.

The first classes were held on August 6, 2007. It serves a student population of grades 9-13, and offers small class sizes, as well as an early start into the college atmosphere. 2 + 4 = 5 Richmond Early College offers the 2 + 4 = 5 program to students, which allows them to work toward a two-year associate's degree (Associate in Arts, Science, Business Administration, and Mechanical Engineering are currently offered), as well as the high school diploma (which would usually take six years combined), and allows them to achieve both in five years or less. This program essentially allows students to substitute electives for college courses. For example, instead of a student taking an art course, the student may be enrolled in a college-level math course. Students will take on more and more college courses with their comfort and experience within the program. In their first semester (Fall, 9th Grade), they will be enrolled in ACA 118, which is a College Student Success course, teaching various techniques of notetaking, time management, and organizational methods. This class is not only very beneficial to the students for the content of the course, but it also offers the students a taste of college. All students within the class will be from REaCH, although that may not be the case in future college courses. The 3 R's REaCH is built upon the '3 R's' principle. The 3 R's specifically are Rigor, Relevance, and Relationships. Rigor REaCH's curriculum is always challenging, always opening the minds of students. Rigor is an excellent part of any curriculum, as it motivates a higher level of willingness to learn. Rigor also creates situations where students more frequently use critical thinking skills to solve problems. Relevance Every student has been in a class where they wonder \\"When will I really use this?\\" or \\"Why am I learning this?\\" At REaCH, we have those questions, too. There's only one difference. Here, the questions are answered. Every student can understand the relevance of each lesson to their daily lives. Understanding this relevance also motivates students to want to learn, as they understand the dependence of their future careers and future lives on the subject or lesson at hand. Relationships Students claim REaCH's faculty are some of the best in the area. Every teacher is familiar with each student's individual learning styles and teachers hold an expectation for students individually, not as a class. Relationships also form within the students at REaCH. Most of REaCH's student body is familiar with at least 70% of the entire student population. The small class sizes encourage not only learning, but social extroversion, allowing students to develop themselves socially and intellectually, all at the same time. Founding Richmond Early College High School is an initiative of Governor Mike Easley and the New Schools Project, with the support of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. As a result of the tremendous support of Bill and Melinda Gates, all tuition and books are provided free of charge to the students, a strong difference from typical dual enrollment. Who can attend REaCH is targeted at first- generation college students whose parent did not graduate from college. Household income and family marital status are among the factors used in determining acceptance to the program. REaCH reviews about 90 applicants each spring and selects 35 to be a part of the ninth grade class. Controversy In 2017, it was widely reported that the school had cancelled yearbook distribution after it was discovered that the yearbooks contained a quote from a student endorsing president Trump's immigration policies. The school declined to reprint the book, and instead offered a refund to the students.

Many people with anorexia see themselves as overweight even though they are, in fact, underweight. They often deny that they have a problem with low weight. They weigh themselves frequently, eat small amounts and only eat certain foods. Some exercise excessively, force themselves to vomit, or use laxatives to lose weight. Complications may include osteoporosis, infertility and heart damage, among others. Women will often stop having menstrual periods. In extreme cases, people with anorexia who continually refuse significant dietary intake and weight restoration interventions, and are declared incompetent to make decisions by a psychiatrist, may be fed by force under restraint via nasogastric tube after asking their parents or proxies to make the decision for them. The cause is currently unknown. There appear to be some genetic components with identical twins more often affected than fraternal twins. Cultural factors also appear to play a role, with societies that value thinness having higher rates of disease. Additionally, it occurs more commonly among those involved in activities that value thinness, such as high-level athletics, modeling and dancing. Anorexia often begins following a major life-change or stress- inducing event. The diagnosis requires a significantly low weight. The severity of disease is based on body mass index (BMI) in adults with mild disease having a BMI of greater than 17, moderate a BMI of 16 to 17, severe a BMI of 15 to 16, and extreme a BMI less than 15. In children a BMI for age percentile of less than the 5th percentile is often used. Treatment of anorexia involves restoring a healthy weight, treating the underlying psychological problems and addressing behaviors that promote the problem. While medications do not help with weight gain, they may be used to help with associated anxiety or depression. Different therapy methods may be useful, such as cognitive behavioral therapy or an approach where parents assume responsibility for feeding their child known as Maudsley family therapy. Sometimes people require admission to a hospital to restore weight. Evidence for benefit from nasogastric tube feeding, however is unclear; such an intervention may be highly distressing for both anorexia patients and healthcare staff when administered against the patient's will under restraint. Some people with anorexia will just have a single episode and recover while others may have recurring episodes over years. Many complications improve or resolve with regaining of weight. Globally, anorexia is estimated to affect 2.9 million people . It is estimated to occur in 0.9% to 4.3% of women and 0.2% to 0.3% of men in Western countries at some point in their life. About 0.4% of young women are affected in a given year and it is estimated to occur ten times more commonly among women than men. Rates in most of the developing world are unclear. Often it begins during the teen years or young adulthood. While anorexia became more commonly diagnosed during the 20th century it is unclear if this was due to an increase in its frequency or simply better diagnosis. In 2013 it directly resulted in about 600 deaths globally, up from 400 deaths in 1990. Eating disorders also increase a person's risk of death from a wide range of other causes, including suicide. About 5% of people with anorexia die from complications over a ten-year period, a nearly six times increased risk. The term \\"anorexia nervosa\\" was first used in 1873 by William Gull to describe this condition.  Signs and symptoms  The back of a person with anorexia Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by attempts to lose weight, to the point of starvation. A person with anorexia nervosa may exhibit a number of signs and symptoms, the type and severity of which may vary and may be present but not readily apparent. Anorexia nervosa, and the associated malnutrition that results from self-imposed starvation, can cause complications in every major organ system in the body. Hypokalaemia, a drop in the level of potassium in the blood, is a sign of anorexia nervosa. A significant drop in potassium can cause abnormal heart rhythms, constipation, fatigue, muscle damage and paralysis. Symptoms may include: * A low body mass index for one's age and height. * Amenorrhea, a symptom that occurs after prolonged weight loss; causing menstruation to stop, hair to become brittle, and skin to become yellow and unhealthy. * Fear of even the slightest weight gain; taking all precautionary measures to avoid weight gain or becoming \\"overweight\\". * Rapid, continuous weight loss. * Lanugo: soft, fine hair growing over the face and body. * An obsession with counting calories and monitoring fat contents of food. * Preoccupation with food, recipes, or cooking; may cook elaborate dinners for others, but not eat the food themselves or consume a very small portion. * Food restrictions despite being underweight or at a healthy weight. * Food rituals, such as cutting food into tiny pieces, refusing to eat around others and hiding or discarding of food. * Purging: May use laxatives, diet pills, ipecac syrup, or water pills to flush food out of their system after eating or may engage in self-induced vomiting though this is a more common symptom of bulimia. * Excessive exercise including micro-exercising, for example making small persistent movements of fingers or toes. * Perception of self as overweight, in contradiction to an underweight reality. * Intolerance to cold and frequent complaints of being cold; body temperature may lower (hypothermia) in an effort to conserve energy due to malnutrition. * Hypotension or orthostatic hypotension. * Bradycardia or tachycardia. * Depression, anxiety disorders and insomnia. * Solitude: may avoid friends and family and become more withdrawn and secretive. * Abdominal distension. * Halitosis (from vomiting or starvation-induced ketosis). * Dry hair and skin, as well as hair thinning. * Chronic fatigue. * Rapid mood swings. * Having feet discoloration causing an orange appearance. * Having severe muscle tension, aches and pains. * Evidence/habits of self harming or self-loathing. * Admiration of thinner people. * Infertility.  Interoceptive  Interoception involves the conscious and unconscious sense of the internal state of the body, and it has an important role in homeostasis and regulation of emotions. Aside from noticeable physiological dysfunction, interoceptive deficits also prompt individuals with anorexia to concentrate on distorted perceptions of multiple elements of their body image. This exists in both people with anorexia and in healthy individuals due to impairment in interoceptive sensitivity and interoceptive awareness. Aside from weight gain and outer appearance, people with anorexia also report abnormal bodily functions such as indistinct feelings of fullness. This provides an example of miscommunication between internal signals of the body and the brain. Due to impaired interoceptive sensitivity, powerful cues of fullness may be detected prematurely in highly sensitive individuals, which can result in decreased calorie consumption and generate anxiety surrounding food intake in anorexia patients. People with anorexia also report difficulty identifying and describing their emotional feelings and the inability to distinguish emotions from bodily sensations in general, called alexithymia. Interoceptive awareness and emotion are deeply intertwined, and could mutually impact each other in abnormalities. Anorexia patients also exhibit emotional regulation difficulties that ignite emotionally-cued eating behaviors, such as restricting food or excessive exercising. Impaired interoceptive sensitivity and interoceptive awareness can lead anorexia patients to adapt distorted interpretations of weight gain that are cued by physical sensations related to digestion (e.g., fullness). Combined, these interoceptive and emotional elements could together trigger maladaptive and negatively reinforced behavioral responses that assist in the maintenance of anorexia. In addition to metacognition, people with anorexia also have difficulty with social cognition including interpreting others‚Äô emotions, and demonstrating empathy. Abnormal interoceptive awareness and interoceptive sensitivity shown through all of these examples have been observed so frequently in anorexia that they have become key characteristics of the illness.  Associated problems  Other psychological issues may factor into anorexia nervosa; some fulfill the criteria for a separate Axis I diagnosis or a personality disorder which is coded Axis II and thus are considered comorbid to the diagnosed eating disorder. Some people have a previous disorder which may increase their vulnerability to developing an eating disorder and some develop them afterwards. The presence of Axis I or Axis II psychiatric comorbidity has been shown to affect the severity and type of anorexia nervosa symptoms in both adolescents and adults. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and obsessive- compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) are highly comorbid with AN, particularly the restrictive subtype. OCPD is linked with more severe symptomatology and worse prognosis. The causality between personality disorders and eating disorders has yet to be fully established. Other comorbid conditions include depression, alcoholism, borderline and other personality disorders, anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). Depression and anxiety are the most common comorbidities, and depression is associated with a worse outcome. Autism spectrum disorders occur more commonly among people with eating disorders than in the general population. Zucker et al. (2007) proposed that conditions on the autism spectrum make up the cognitive endophenotype underlying anorexia nervosa and appealed for increased interdisciplinary collaboration.  Causes  Dysregulation of the serotonin pathways has been implicated in the cause and mechanism of anorexia. There is evidence for biological, psychological, developmental, and sociocultural risk factors, but the exact cause of eating disorders is unknown. Genetic Genetic correlations of anorexia with psychiatric and metabolic traits. Anorexia nervosa is highly heritable. Twin studies have shown a heritability rate of between 28 and 58%. First-degree relatives of those with anorexia have roughly 12 times the risk of developing anorexia. Association studies have been performed, studying 128 different polymorphisms related to 43 genes including genes involved in regulation of eating behavior, motivation and reward mechanics, personality traits and emotion. Consistent associations have been identified for polymorphisms associated with agouti-related peptide, brain derived neurotrophic factor, catechol-o-methyl transferase, SK3 and opioid receptor delta-1. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, may contribute to the development or maintenance of anorexia nervosa, though clinical research in this area is in its infancy. A 2019 study found a genetic relationship with mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder, anxiety disorder and depression; and metabolic functioning with a negative correlation with fat mass, type 2 diabetes and leptin. Environmental Obstetric complications: prenatal and perinatal complications may factor into the development of anorexia nervosa, such as preterm birth, maternal anemia, diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, placental infarction, and neonatal heart abnormalities. Neonatal complications may also have an influence on harm avoidance, one of the personality traits associated with the development of AN. Neuroendocrine dysregulation: altered signalling of peptides that facilitate communication between the gut, brain and adipose tissue, such as ghrelin, leptin, neuropeptide Y and orexin, may contribute to the pathogenesis of anorexia nervosa by disrupting regulation of hunger and satiety. Gastrointestinal diseases: people with gastrointestinal disorders may be more at risk of developing disorders of eating practices than the general population, principally restrictive eating disturbances. An association of anorexia nervosa with celiac disease has been found. The role that gastrointestinal symptoms play in the development of eating disorders seems rather complex. Some authors report that unresolved symptoms prior to gastrointestinal disease diagnosis may create a food aversion in these persons, causing alterations to their eating patterns. Other authors report that greater symptoms throughout their diagnosis led to greater risk. It has been documented that some people with celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease who are not conscious about the importance of strictly following their diet, choose to consume their trigger foods to promote weight loss. On the other hand, individuals with good dietary management may develop anxiety, food aversion and eating disorders because of concerns around cross contamination of their foods. Some authors suggest that medical professionals should evaluate the presence of an unrecognized celiac disease in all people with eating disorder, especially if they present any gastrointestinal symptom (such as decreased appetite, abdominal pain, bloating, distension, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation), weight loss, or growth failure; and also routinely ask celiac patients about weight or body shape concerns, dieting or vomiting for weight control, to evaluate the possible presence of eating disorders, especially in women. Studies have hypothesized the continuance of disordered eating patterns may be epiphenomena of starvation. The results of the Minnesota Starvation Experiment showed normal controls exhibit many of the behavioral patterns of AN when subjected to starvation. This may be due to the numerous changes in the neuroendocrine system, which results in a self- perpetuating cycle. Anorexia nervosa is more likely to occur in a person's pubertal years. Some explanatory hypotheses for the rising prevalence of eating disorders in adolescence are \\"increase of adipose tissue in girls, hormonal changes of puberty, societal expectations of increased independence and autonomy that are particularly difficult for anorexic adolescents to meet; [and] increased influence of the peer group and its values.\\"  Psychological  Early theories of the cause of anorexia linked it to childhood sexual abuse or dysfunctional families; evidence is conflicting, and well-designed research is needed. The fear of food is known as sitiophobia, cibophobia, and is part of the differential diagnosis. Other psychological causes of anorexia include low self-esteem, feeling like there is lack of control, depression, anxiety, and loneliness.Some anorexic people might be perfectionists or have an obsessive compulsive personality which makes them stick to a restricted diet.  Sociological  Anorexia nervosa has been increasingly diagnosed since 1950; the increase has been linked to vulnerability and internalization of body ideals. People in professions where there is a particular social pressure to be thin (such as models and dancers) were more likely to develop anorexia, and those with anorexia have much higher contact with cultural sources that promote weight loss. This trend can also be observed for people who partake in certain sports, such as jockeys and wrestlers.Anderson-Fye, Eileen P. and Becker, Anne E. (2004) \\"Sociocultural Aspects of Eating Disorders\\" pp. 565‚Äì89 in Handbook of Eating Disorders and Obesity, J. Kevin (ed.). Thompson. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons. There is a higher incidence and prevalence of anorexia nervosa in sports with an emphasis on aesthetics, where low body fat is advantageous, and sports in which one has to make weight for competition. Family group dynamics can play a role in the cause of anorexia. When there is a constant pressure from people to be thin, teasing and bullying can cause low self-esteem and other psychological symptoms.  Media effects  Persistent exposure to media that presents body ideals may constitute a risk factor for body dissatisfaction and anorexia nervosa. The cultural ideal for body shape for men versus women continues to favor slender women and athletic, V-shaped muscular men. A 2002 review found that, of the magazines most popular among people aged 18 to 24 years, those read by men, unlike those read by women, were more likely to feature ads and articles on shape than on diet. Body dissatisfaction and internalization of body ideals are risk factors for anorexia nervosa that threaten the health of both male and female populations. Websites that stress the importance of attainment of body ideals extol and promote anorexia nervosa through the use of religious metaphors, lifestyle descriptions, \\"thinspiration\\" or \\"fitspiration\\" (inspirational photo galleries and quotes that aim to serve as motivators for attainment of body ideals). Pro-anorexia websites reinforce internalization of body ideals and the importance of their attainment. The media portray a false view of what people truly look like. In magazines and movies and even on billboards most of the actors/models are digitally altered in multiple ways. People then strive to look like these \\"perfect\\" role models when in reality they are not near perfection themselves.  Mechanisms  Evidence from physiological, pharmacological and neuroimaging studies suggest serotonin (also called 5-HT) may play a role in anorexia. While acutely ill, metabolic changes may produce a number of biological findings in people with anorexia that are not necessarily causative of the anorexic behavior. For example, abnormal hormonal responses to challenges with serotonergic agents have been observed during acute illness, but not recovery. Nevertheless, increased cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (a metabolite of serotonin), and changes in anorectic behavior in response to acute tryptophan depletion (tryptophan is a metabolic precursor to serotonin) support a role in anorexia. The activity of the 5-HT2A receptors has been reported to be lower in patients with anorexia in a number of cortical regions, evidenced by lower binding potential of this receptor as measured by PET or SPECT, independent of the state of illness. While these findings may be confounded by comorbid psychiatric disorders, taken as a whole they indicate serotonin in anorexia. These alterations in serotonin have been linked to traits characteristic of anorexia such as obsessiveness, anxiety, and appetite dysregulation. Neuroimaging studies investigating the functional connectivity between brain regions have observed a number of alterations in networks related to cognitive control, introspection, and sensory function. Alterations in networks related to the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex may be related to excessive cognitive control of eating related behaviors. Similarly, altered somatosensory integration and introspection may relate to abnormal body image. A review of functional neuroimaging studies reported reduced activations in \\"bottom up\\" limbic region and increased activations in \\"top down\\" cortical regions which may play a role in restrictive eating. Compared to controls, recovered anorexics show reduced activation in the reward system in response to food, and reduced correlation between self reported liking of a sugary drink and activity in the striatum and anterior cingulate cortex. Increased binding potential of 11C radiolabelled raclopride in the striatum, interpreted as reflecting decreased endogenous dopamine due to competitive displacement, has also been observed. Structural neuroimaging studies have found global reductions in both gray matter and white matter, as well as increased cerebrospinal fluid volumes. Regional decreases in the left hypothalamus, left inferior parietal lobe, right lentiform nucleus and right caudate have also been reported in acutely ill patients. However, these alterations seem to be associated with acute malnutrition and largely reversible with weight restoration, at least in nonchronic cases in younger people. In contrast, some studies have reported increased orbitofrontal cortex volume in currently ill and in recovered patients, although findings are inconsistent. Reduced white matter integrity in the fornix has also been reported.  Diagnosis  A diagnostic assessment includes the person's current circumstances, biographical history, current symptoms, and family history. The assessment also includes a mental state examination, which is an assessment of the person's current mood and thought content, focusing on views on weight and patterns of eating.  DSM-5  Anorexia nervosa is classified under the Feeding and Eating Disorders in the latest revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5). There is no specific BMI cutoff that defines low weight required for the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa. The diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa (all of which needing to be met for diagnosis) include: *Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements leading to a low body weight. *Intense fear of gaining weight or persistent behaviors that interfere with gaining weight. *Disturbance in the way a person's weight or body shape is experienced or a lack of recognition about the risks of the low body weight. Relative to the previous version of the DSM (DSM-IV-TR), the 2013 revision (DSM5) reflects changes in the criteria for anorexia nervosa, most notably that of the amenorrhea criterion being removed. Amenorrhea was removed for several reasons: it does not apply to males, it is not applicable for females before or after the age of menstruation or taking birth control pills, and some women who meet the other criteria for AN still report some menstrual activity. = Subtypes = There are two subtypes of AN: * Binge-eating/purging type: the individual utilizes binge eating or displays purging behavior as a means for losing weight. It is different from bulimia nervosa in terms of the individual's weight. An individual with binge- eating/purging type anorexia can maintain a healthy or normal weight, but is usually significantly underweight. People with bulimia nervosa on the other hand can sometimes be overweight. * Restricting type: the individual uses restricting food intake, fasting, diet pills, or exercise as a means for losing weight; they may exercise excessively to keep off weight or prevent weight gain, and some individuals eat only enough to stay alive. In the restrictive type, there are no recurrent episodes of binge-eating or purging present. = Levels of severity = Body mass index (BMI) is used by the DSM-5 as an indicator of the level of severity of anorexia nervosa. The DSM-5 states these as follows: * Mild: BMI of greater than 17 * Moderate: BMI of 16‚Äì16.99 * Severe: BMI of 15‚Äì15.99 * Extreme: BMI of less than 15  Investigations  Medical tests to check for signs of physical deterioration in anorexia nervosa may be performed by a general physician or psychiatrist, including: * Complete Blood Count (CBC): a test of the white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets used to assess the presence of various disorders such as leukocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytosis and anemia which may result from malnutrition. * Urinalysis: a variety of tests performed on the urine used in the diagnosis of medical disorders, to test for substance abuse, and as an indicator of overall healthUrinalysis at Medline . Nlm.nih.gov (26 January 2012). Retrieved on 4 February 2012. * Chem-20: Chem-20 also known as SMA-20 a group of twenty separate chemical tests performed on blood serum. Tests include cholesterol, protein and electrolytes such as potassium, chlorine and sodium and tests specific to liver and kidney function.Chem-20 at Medline . Nlm.nih.gov. Retrieved on 4 February 2012. * Glucose tolerance test: Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) used to assess the body's ability to metabolize glucose. Can be useful in detecting various disorders such as diabetes, an insulinoma, Cushing's Syndrome, hypoglycemia and polycystic ovary syndrome. * Serum cholinesterase test: a test of liver enzymes (acetylcholinesterase and pseudocholinesterase) useful as a test of liver function and to assess the effects of malnutrition. * Liver Function Test: A series of tests used to assess liver function some of the tests are also used in the assessment of malnutrition, protein deficiency, kidney function, bleeding disorders, and Crohn's Disease. *Luteinizing hormone (LH) response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH): Tests the pituitary glands' response to GnRh, a hormone produced in the hypothalamus. Hypogonadism is often seen in anorexia nervosa cases. *Creatine kinase (CK) test: measures the circulating blood levels of creatine kinase an enzyme found in the heart (CK-MB), brain (CK-BB) and skeletal muscle (CK-MM). * Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) test: urea nitrogen is the byproduct of protein metabolism first formed in the liver then removed from the body by the kidneys. The BUN test is primarily used to test kidney function. A low BUN level may indicate the effects of malnutrition.BUN at Medline . Nlm.nih.gov (26 January 2012). Retrieved on 4 February 2012. * BUN-to-creatinine ratio: A BUN to creatinine ratio is used to predict various conditions. A high BUN/creatinine ratio can occur in severe hydration, acute kidney failure, congestive heart failure, and intestinal bleeding. A low BUN/creatinine ratio can indicate a low protein diet, celiac disease, rhabdomyolysis, or cirrhosis of the liver. * Electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG): measures electrical activity of the heart. It can be used to detect various disorders such as hyperkalemia. * Electroencephalogram (EEG): measures the electrical activity of the brain. It can be used to detect abnormalities such as those associated with pituitary tumors. * Thyroid screen: test used to assess thyroid functioning by checking levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroxine (T4), and triiodothyronine (T3).  Differential diagnoses  A variety of medical and psychological conditions have been misdiagnosed as anorexia nervosa; in some cases the correct diagnosis was not made for more than ten years. The distinction between the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS) is often difficult to make as there is considerable overlap between people diagnosed with these conditions. Seemingly minor changes in people's overall behavior or attitude can change a diagnosis from anorexia: binge-eating type to bulimia nervosa. A main factor differentiating binge-purge anorexia from bulimia is the gap in physical weight. Someone with bulimia nervosa is ordinarily at a healthy weight, or slightly overweight. Someone with binge-purge anorexia is commonly underweight. People with the binge-purging subtype of AN may be significantly underweight and typically do not binge-eat large amounts of food, yet they purge the small amount of food they eat. In contrast, those with bulimia nervosa tend to be at normal weight or overweight and binge large amounts of food. It is not unusual for a person with an eating disorder to \\"move through\\" various diagnoses as their behavior and beliefs change over time.  Treatment  There is no conclusive evidence that any particular treatment for anorexia nervosa works better than others; however, there is enough evidence to suggest that early intervention and treatment are more effective. Treatment for anorexia nervosa tries to address three main areas. * Restoring the person to a healthy weight; * Treating the psychological disorders related to the illness; * Reducing or eliminating behaviours or thoughts that originally led to the disordered eating. Although restoring the person's weight is the primary task at hand, optimal treatment also includes and monitors behavioral change in the individual as well.National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health (2004). Eating Disorders: Core interventions in the treatment and management of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and related eating disorders. London, The British Psychological Society and The Royal College of Psychiatrists. There is some evidence that hospitalisation might adversely affect long term outcome. Psychotherapy for individuals with AN is challenging as they may value being thin and may seek to maintain control and resist change. Some studies demonstrate that family based therapy in adolescents with AN is superior to individual therapy. Due to the nature of the condition, treatment of people with AN can be difficult because they are afraid of gaining weight. Initially developing a desire to change is important.  Diet  Diet is the most essential factor to work on in people with anorexia nervosa, and must be tailored to each person's needs. Food variety is important when establishing meal plans as well as foods that are higher in energy density. People must consume adequate calories, starting slowly, and increasing at a measured pace. Evidence of a role for zinc supplementation during refeeding is unclear.  Therapy  Family-based treatment (FBT) has been shown to be more successful than individual therapy for adolescents with AN. Various forms of family-based treatment have been proven to work in the treatment of adolescent AN including conjoint family therapy (CFT), in which the parents and child are seen together by the same therapist, and separated family therapy (SFT) in which the parents and child attend therapy separately with different therapists. Proponents of family therapy for adolescents with AN assert that it is important to include parents in the adolescent's treatment. A four- to five-year follow up study of the Maudsley family therapy, an evidence-based manualized model, showed full recovery at rates up to 90%. Although this model is recommended by the NIMH, critics claim that it has the potential to create power struggles in an intimate relationship and may disrupt equal partnerships. There is tentative evidence that family therapy is as effective as treatment as usual and it is unclear if family therapy is more effective than educational interventions. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is useful in adolescents and adults with anorexia nervosa; acceptance and commitment therapy is a type of CBT, which has shown promise in the treatment of AN. Cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) is used in treating anorexia nervosa.  Medication  Pharmaceuticals have limited benefit for anorexia itself. There is a lack of good information from which to make recommendations concerning the effectiveness of antidepressants in treating anorexia.  Admission to hospital  AN has a high mortality and patients admitted in a severely ill state to medical units are at particularly high risk. Diagnosis can be challenging, risk assessment may not be performed accurately, consent and the need for compulsion may not be assessed appropriately, refeeding syndrome may be missed or poorly treated and the behavioural and family problems in AN may be missed or poorly managed. The MARSIPAN guidelines recommend that medical and psychiatric experts work together in managing severely ill people with AN.Royal_College_of_Psychiatrists (2014). MARSIPAN : Management of Really Sick Patients with Anorexia Nervosa. Second edition. Page 6  Nutrition  The rate of refeeding can be difficult to establish, because the fear of refeeding syndrome (RFS) can lead to underfeeding. It is thought that RFS, with falling phosphate and potassium levels, is more likely to occur when BMI is very low, and when medical comorbidities such as infection or cardiac failure, are present. In those circumstances, it is recommended to start refeeding slowly but to build up rapidly as long as RFS does not occur. Recommendations on energy requirements vary, from 5‚Äì10 kcal/kg/day in the most medically compromised patients, who appear to have the highest risk of RFS, to 1900 kcal/day.http://%5Bhttps://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg32/chapter/1-Guidance#what- to-give-in-hospital-and-the- community%20NICE%20guideline%20on%20Nutrition%20support%5D  Prognosis  Deaths due to eating disorders per million persons in 2012 AN has the highest mortality rate of any psychological disorder. The mortality rate is 11 to 12 times greater than in the general population, and the suicide risk is 56 times higher. Half of women with AN achieve a full recovery, while an additional 20‚Äì30% may partially recover. Not all people with anorexia recover completely: about 20% develop anorexia nervosa as a chronic disorder. If anorexia nervosa is not treated, serious complications such as heart conditions and kidney failure can arise and eventually lead to death. The average number of years from onset to remission of AN is seven for women and three for men. After ten to fifteen years, 70% of people no longer meet the diagnostic criteria, but many still continue to have eating-related problems. Alexithymia influences treatment outcome. Recovery is also viewed on a spectrum rather than black and white. According to the Morgan-Russell criteria, individuals can have a good, intermediate, or poor outcome. Even when a person is classified as having a \\"good\\" outcome, weight only has to be within 15% of average, and normal menstruation must be present in females. The good outcome also excludes psychological health. Recovery for people with anorexia nervosa is undeniably positive, but recovery does not mean a return to normal.  Complications  Anorexia nervosa can have serious implications if its duration and severity are significant and if onset occurs before the completion of growth, pubertal maturation, or the attainment of peak bone mass. Complications specific to adolescents and children with anorexia nervosa can include the following: Growth retardation may occur, as height gain may slow and can stop completely with severe weight loss or chronic malnutrition. In such cases, provided that growth potential is preserved, height increase can resume and reach full potential after normal intake is resumed. Height potential is normally preserved if the duration and severity of illness are not significant or if the illness is accompanied by delayed bone age (especially prior to a bone age of approximately 15 years), as hypogonadism may partially counteract the effects of undernutrition on height by allowing for a longer duration of growth compared to controls. Appropriate early treatment can preserve height potential, and may even help to increase it in some post-anorexic subjects, due to factors such as long-term reduced estrogen-producing adipose tissue levels compared to premorbid levels. In some cases, especially where onset is before puberty, complications such as stunted growth and pubertal delay are usually reversible. Anorexia nervosa causes alterations in the female reproductive system; significant weight loss, as well as psychological stress and intense exercise, typically results in a cessation of menstruation in women who are past puberty. In patients with anorexia nervosa, there is a reduction of the secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone in the central nervous system, preventing ovulation. Anorexia nervosa can also result in pubertal delay or arrest. Both height gain and pubertal development are dependent on the release of growth hormone and gonadotropins (LH and FSH) from the pituitary gland. Suppression of gonadotropins in people with anorexia nervosa has been documented. Typically, growth hormone (GH) levels are high, but levels of IGF-1, the downstream hormone that should be released in response to GH are low; this indicates a state of ‚Äúresistance‚Äù to GH due to chronic starvation. IGF-1 is necessary for bone formation, and decreased levels in anorexia nervosa contribute to a loss of bone density and potentially contribute to osteopenia or osteoporosis. Anorexia nervosa can also result in reduction of peak bone mass. Buildup of bone is greatest during adolescence, and if onset of anorexia nervosa occurs during this time and stalls puberty, low bone mass may be permanent. Hepatic steatosis, or fatty infiltration of the liver, can also occur, and is an indicator of malnutrition in children. Neurological disorders that may occur as complications include seizures and tremors. Wernicke encephalopathy, which results from vitamin B1 deficiency, has been reported in patients who are extremely malnourished; symptoms include confusion, problems with the muscles responsible for eye movements and abnormalities in walking gait. The most common gastrointestinal complications of anorexia nervosa are delayed stomach emptying and constipation, but also include elevated liver function tests, diarrhea, acute pancreatitis, heartburn, difficulty swallowing, and, rarely, superior mesenteric artery syndrome. Delayed stomach emptying, or gastroparesis, often develops following food restriction and weight loss; the most common symptom is bloating with gas and abdominal distension, and often occurs after eating. Other symptoms of gastroparesis include early satiety, fullness, nausea, and vomiting. The symptoms may inhibit efforts at eating and recovery, but can be managed by limiting high-fiber foods, using liquid nutritional supplements, or using metoclopramide to increase emptying of food from the stomach. Gastroparesis generally resolves when weight is regained. =Cardiac complications= Anorexia nervosa increases the risk of sudden cardiac death, though the precise cause is unknown. Cardiac complications include structural and functional changes to the heart. Some of these cardiovascular changes are mild and are reversible with treatment, while others may be life-threatening. Cardiac complications can include arrhythmias, abnormally slow heart beat, low blood pressure, decreased size of the heart muscle, reduced heart volume, mitral valve prolapse, myocardial fibrosis, and pericardial effusion. Abnormalities in conduction and repolarization of the heart that can result from anorexia nervosa include QT prolongation, increased QT dispersion, conduction delays, and junctional escape rhythms. Electrolyte abnormalities, particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, can cause anomalies in the electrical activity of the heart, and result in life-threatening arrhythmias. Hypokalemia most commonly results in anorexic patients when restricting is accompanied by purging (induced vomiting or laxative use). Hypotension (low blood pressure) is common, and symptoms include fatigue and weakness. Orthostatic hypotension, a marked decrease in blood pressure when standing from a supine position, may also occur. Symptoms include lightheadedness upon standing, weakness, and cognitive impairment, and may result in fainting or near-fainting. Orthostasis in anorexia nervosa indicates worsening cardiac function and may indicate a need for hospitalization. Hypotension and orthostasis generally resolve upon recovery to a normal weight. The weight loss in anorexia nervosa also causes atrophy of cardiac muscle. This leads to decreased ability to pump blood, a reduction in the ability to sustain exercise, a diminished ability to increase blood pressure in response to exercise, and a subjective feeling of fatigue. Some individuals may also have a decrease in cardiac contractility. Cardiac complications can be life- threatening, but the heart muscle generally improves with weight gain, and the heart normalizes in size over weeks to months, with recovery. Atrophy of the heart muscle is a marker of the severity of the disease, and while it is reversible with treatment and refeeding, it is possible that it may cause permanent, microscopic changes to the heart muscle that increase the risk of sudden cardiac death. Individuals with anorexia nervosa may experience chest pain or palpitations; these can be a result of mitral valve prolapse. Mitral valve prolapse occurs because the size of the heart muscle decreases while the tissue of the mitral valve remains the same size. Studies have shown rates of mitral valve prolapse of around 20 percent in those with anorexia nervosa, while the rate in the general population is estimated at 2‚Äì4 percent. It has been suggested that there is an association between mitral valve prolapse and sudden cardiac death, but it has not been proven to be causative, either in patients with anorexia nervosa or in the general population.  Relapse  Rates of relapse after treatment range from 9‚Äì52% with many studies reporting a relapse rate of at least 25%. Relapse occurs in approximately a third of people in hospital, and is greatest in the first six to eighteen months after release from an institution.  Epidemiology  Anorexia is estimated to occur in 0.9% to 4.3% of women and 0.2% to 0.3% of men in Western countries at some point in their life. About 0.4% of young females are affected in a given year and it is estimated to occur three to ten times less commonly in males. Rates in most of the developing world are unclear. Often it begins during the teen years or young adulthood. The lifetime rate of atypical anorexia nervosa, a form of ED-NOS in which the person loses a significant amount of weight and is at risk for serious medical complications despite having a higher body-mass index, is much higher, at 5‚Äì12%. While anorexia became more commonly diagnosed during the 20th century it is unclear if this was due to an increase in its frequency or simply better diagnosis. Most studies show that since at least 1970 the incidence of AN in adult women is fairly constant, while there is some indication that the incidence may have been increasing for girls aged between 14 and 20. According to researcher Ben Radford who wrote in Skeptical Inquirer \\"I found many examples of flawed, misleading, and sometimes completely wrong information and data being copied and widely disseminated among eating disorder organizations and educators without anyone bothering to consult the original research to verify its accuracy\\". Radford states that misleading statistics and data have been ignored by organizations like the National Eating Disorder Association who has not released data for \\"incidence of anorexia from 1984‚Äì2017\\" he states that each agency continues to report incorrect numbers assuming that someone else has checked the accuracy.  Underrepresentation  Eating disorders are less reported in preindustrial, non-westernized countries than in Western countries. In Africa, not including South Africa, the only data presenting information about eating disorders occurs in case reports and isolated studies, not studies investigating prevalence. Data shows in research that in westernized civilizations, ethnic minorities have very similar rates of eating disorders, contrary to the belief that eating disorders predominantly occur in white people. Men (and women) who might otherwise be diagnosed with anorexia may not meet the DSM IV criteria for BMI since they have muscle weight, but have very little fat. Male and female athletes are often overlooked as anorexic. Research emphasizes the importance to take athletes' diet, weight and symptoms into account when diagnosing anorexia, instead of just looking at weight and BMI. For athletes, ritualized activities such as weigh-ins place emphasis on weight, which may promote the development of eating disorders among them. While women use diet pills, which is an indicator of unhealthy behavior and an eating disorder, men use steroids, which contextualizes the beauty ideals for genders. In a Canadian study, 4% of boys in grade nine used anabolic steroids. Anorexic men are sometimes referred to as manorexic.  History  Two images of an anorexic woman published in 1900 in \\"Nouvelle Iconographie de la Salp√™tri√®re\\". The case was titled \\"Un cas d'anorexie hysterique\\" (A case of hysteric anorexia). The term \\"anorexia nervosa\\" was coined in 1873 by Sir William Gull, one of Queen Victoria's personal physicians. The history of anorexia nervosa begins with descriptions of religious fasting dating from the Hellenistic era and continuing into the medieval period. The medieval practice of self- starvation by women, including some young women, in the name of religious piety and purity also concerns anorexia nervosa; it is sometimes referred to as anorexia mirabilis. The earliest medical descriptions of anorexic illnesses are generally credited to English physician Richard Morton in 1689. Case descriptions fitting anorexic illnesses continued throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. In the late 19th century anorexia nervosa became widely accepted by the medical profession as a recognized condition. In 1873, Sir William Gull, one of Queen Victoria's personal physicians, published a seminal paper which coined the term \\"anorexia nervosa\\" and provided a number of detailed case descriptions and treatments. In the same year, French physician Ernest-Charles Las√®gue similarly published details of a number of cases in a paper entitled De l'Anorexie hyst√©rique. See also Awareness of the condition was largely limited to the medical profession until the latter part of the 20th century, when German-American psychoanalyst Hilde Bruch published The Golden Cage: the Enigma of Anorexia Nervosa in 1978. Despite major advances in neuroscience, Bruch's theories tend to dominate popular thinking. A further important event was the death of the popular singer and drummer Karen Carpenter in 1983, which prompted widespread ongoing media coverage of eating disorders.  Etymology  The term is of Greek origin: an- (·ºÄŒΩ-, prefix denoting negation) and orexis (·ΩÑœÅŒµŒæŒπœÇ, \\"appetite\\"), translating literally to a nervous loss of appetite.

It was founded in 2004 by entrepreneur Bas Peeperkorn. Serious Gaming is known for their achievements in first-person shooter Deathmatch tournaments, most notably those by Quake series players Maciej \\"av3k\\" Krzykowski and Alexey \\"cypher\\" Yanushevsky. History ;2005 Serious Gaming was founded in 2004 by Bas Peeperkorn, the team's first signing was Painkiller player Niels van Tilborg. Painkiller was the game used for the US$1,000,000 2005 CPL World Tour and following van Tilborg the following players were signed and represented Serious Gaming throughout the tour: Fredrik Edesater and Stefan Timmermans. Highlights for the team included a ninth-place finish at the Chile stop and two players being among the 32 players in the world tour finals. In 2005 Serious Gaming also competed in televised competition at the World eSport Games in Seoul, Korea, being represented at the second edition of the event by a Counter-Strike division consisting of Finnish players. This division would disband shortly after their stay in Seoul. ;2006-2007 Following the 2005 World Tour the main focus of the first-person shooter Deatmatch scene switched from Painkiller to the newly released Quake IV and Serious Gaming followed. Contracts with van Tilborg and Edesater ended, Timmermans would take a management position and help guide two newly signed players in the professional gaming scene: Markus Andersen and Maciej Krzykowski. Andersen would develop into a champion player at the national level but never take the step to international competition. Kryzkowski quickly established himself as a major contender in international competition, being recognized as the newcomer of the year in all of eSports in 2006. Kryzkowski ended up winning the Quake competition at ESWC 2007 without losing a map, becoming the youngest Quake and ESWC world champion in history. 2006 was also the year Serious Gaming established a Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne division, originally signing Oskar Rudberg and Jos Buijvoets. Rudberg would retire shortly after joining and Buijvoets transitioned into a managerial role. The team signed and released a variety of players including (now) professional gamers Benjamin Baker and Daniel Spenst. Eventually a stable line-up of players would emerge that represented the team for several years including Kevin van der Kooi, Nikolaus Cassidy and Hjalmar H√∂gberg. Serious Gaming also signed two separate European champion Call of Duty 2 teams, the first of which disbanded several months after joining and the second of which disbanded after unsuccessfully trying to transition to Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. ;2008-2010 Following the collapse of the World Series of Video Games the focus of the Deathmatch scene switched back to Quake III in 2008. Serious Gaming signed Alexey Yanushevsky in July 2008. Yanushevsky would win the 2008 Electronic Sports World Cup with Kryzkowski being unable to defend his title due to his visa being rejected. Yanushevsky would later also win the professional tournament at QuakeCon 2008 which was the first time QuakeLive was used at a major professional gaming event, this game would quickly become the standard for professional Deathmatch competition and remains to be until today. The two would compete in various Quake competitions throughout 2008, 2009 and 2010 and in Tek-9 Network's inaugarul QuakeLive ranking (February 2010) Yanushevsky was ranked the world's number one QuakeLive player with Kryzkowski taking a third place. Also signed November 1, 2009 was Adrien Denis \\"in full harmony with the teams philosophy of converting young talented players into tournament winners\\". Individual Serious Gaming players won tournaments at the national and continental level. After signing Kim Dong Hwan the team also competed at the highest levels of team leagues, culminating in a third place at the Warcraft 3 Champions League season XVI. Kim was recognized as one of the most impressive newcomers in Warcraft III. In 2010 Cassidy and Buijvoets would transition to form a StarCraft II squad competing in the newly released StarCraft II beta while both still filling a role in the WarCraft III division. This year van der Kooi would leave Serious Gaming to lead a Heroes of Newerth division for professional gaming team fnatic. Added in 2010 would be Lennart Roest in order to ensure the team's viability in team competitions. On May 21, 2010 van der Kooi re-joined the real-time strategy roster as part of the StarCraft II squad. He would be joined by Dlovan van den Bosch on June 14, 2010 and Alexander Hein on August 11, 2010. Serious Gaming also signed a French Defense of the Ancients division in 2008. Several months after announcing the team the Electronic Sports World Cup announced the inclusion of Defense of the Ancients at their main event. Serious Gaming Defense of the Ancients ended up winning the French championship and qualify for the 2008 Electronic Sports World Cup where they would take 7th place. Following this tournament the Serious Gaming organisation and its Defense of the Ancients division parted amicably.

Panic attacks are sudden periods of intense fear that may include palpitations, sweating, shaking, shortness of breath, numbness, or a feeling that something terrible is going to happen. The maximum degree of symptoms occurs within minutes. There may be ongoing worries about having further attacks and avoidance of places where attacks have occurred in the past. The cause of panic disorder is unknown. Panic disorder often runs in families. Risk factors include smoking, psychological stress, and a history of child abuse. Diagnosis involves ruling out other potential causes of anxiety including other mental disorders, medical conditions such as heart disease or hyperthyroidism, and drug use. Screening for the condition may be done using a questionnaire. Panic disorder is usually treated with counselling and medications. The type of counselling used is typically cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) which is effective in more than half of people. Medications used include antidepressants and occasionally benzodiazepines or beta blockers. Following stopping treatment up to 30% of people have a recurrence. Panic disorder affects about 2.5% of people at some point in their life. It usually begins during adolescence or early adulthood but any age can be affected. It is less common in children and older people. Women are more often affected than men. Signs and symptoms Panic disorder sufferers usually have a series of intense episodes of extreme anxiety during panic attacks. These attacks typically last about ten minutes, and can be as short-lived as 1‚Äì5 minutes, but can last twenty minutes to more than an hour, or until helpful intervention is made. Panic attacks can wax and wane for a period of hours (panic attacks rolling into one another), and the intensity and specific symptoms of panic may vary over the duration. In some cases, the attack may continue at unabated high intensity or seem to be increasing in severity. Common symptoms of an attack include rapid heartbeat, perspiration, dizziness, dyspnea, trembling, uncontrollable fear such as: the fear of losing control and going crazy,depression and anxiety 27:93‚Äì112, 2010. the fear of dyingmarquez (N.D).

Other symptoms are a sensation of choking, paralysis, chest pain, nausea, numbness or tingling, chills or hot flashes, faintness, cryingDiler et al., (2004) Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment of Adolescent Panic. and some sense of altered reality.Frisch, N. and Frisch, L. 2006. Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing. 3rd ed. Canada: Thomson Delmar Learning. In addition, the person usually has thoughts of impending doom.Healy (2009) Psychiatric Drugs Explained Individuals suffering from an episode have often a strong wish of escaping from the situation that provoked the attack. The anxiety of panic disorder is particularly severe and noticeably episodic compared to that from generalized anxiety disorder. Panic attacks may be provoked by exposure to certain stimuli (e.g., seeing a mouse) or settings (e.g., the dentist's office). Other attacks may appear unprovoked. Some individuals deal with these events on a regular basis, sometimes daily or weekly. The outward symptoms of a panic attack often cause negative social experiences (e.g., embarrassment, social stigma, social isolation, etc.). Limited symptom attacks are similar to panic attacks but have fewer symptoms. Most people with PD experience both panic attacks and limited symptom attacks.  Interoceptive  Studies investigating the relationship between interoception and panic disorder have shown that people with panic disorder feel heartbeat sensations more intensely when stimulated by pharmacological agents, suggesting that they experience heightened interoceptive awareness compared to healthy subjects. Causes=Psychological models While there is not just one explanation for the cause of panic disorder, there are certain perspectives researchers use to explain the disorder. The first one is the biological perspective. Past research concluded that there is irregular norepinephrine activity in people who have panic attacks. Current research also supports this perspective as it has been found that those with panic disorder also have a brain circuit that performs improperly. This circuit consists of the amygdala, central gray matter, ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the locus ceruleus. There is also the cognitive perspective. Theorists believe that people with panic disorder may experience panic reactions because they mistake their bodily sensations for life-threatening situations. These bodily sensations cause some people to feel as though are out of control which may lead to feelings of panic. This misconception of bodily sensations is referred to as anxiety sensitivity, and studies suggest that people who score higher on anxiety sensitivity surveys are fives times more likely to be diagnosed with panic disorder. Panic disorder has been found to run in families, which suggests that inheritance plays a strong role in determining who will get it. Psychological factors, stressful life events, life transitions, and environment as well as often thinking in a way that exaggerates relatively normal bodily reactions are also believed to play a role in the onset of panic disorder. Often the first attacks are triggered by physical illnesses, major stress, or certain medications. People who tend to take on excessive responsibilities may develop a tendency to suffer panic attacks. Post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients also show a much higher rate of panic disorder than the general population. Prepulse inhibition has been found to be reduced in patients with panic disorder. Substance misuse Substance abuse is often correlated with panic attacks. In a study 39% of people with panic disorder had abused substances. Of those who used alcohol 63% reported that the alcohol use began prior to the onset of panic, and 59% of those abusing illicit drugs reported that drug use began first. The study that was conducted documented the panic-substance abuse relationship. Substance abuse began prior to onset of panic and substances were used to self-medicate for panic attacks by only a few subjects. In another study, 100 methamphetamine-dependent individuals were analyzed for co-morbid psychiatric disorders; of the 100 individuals, 36% were categorized as having co-morbid psychiatric disorders. Mood and Psychotic disorders were more prevalent than anxiety disorders, which accounted for 7% of the 100 sampled individuals. =Smoking= Tobacco smoking increases the risk of developing panic disorder with or without agoraphobia and panic attacks; smoking started in adolescence or early adulthood particularly increases this risk of developing panic disorder. While the mechanism of how smoking increases panic attacks is not fully understood, a few hypotheses have been derived. Smoking cigarettes may lead to panic attacks by causing changes in respiratory function (e.g. feeling short of breath). These respiratory changes in turn can lead to the formation of panic attacks, as respiratory symptoms are a prominent feature of panic. Respiratory abnormalities have been found in children with high levels of anxiety, which suggests that a person with these difficulties may be susceptible to panic attacks, and thus more likely to subsequently develop panic disorder. Nicotine, a stimulant, could contribute to panic attacks. However, nicotine withdrawal may also cause significant anxiety which could contribute to panic attacks. It is also possible that panic disorder patients smoke cigarettes as a form of self-medication to lessen anxiety. Nicotine and other psychoactive compounds with antidepressant properties in tobacco smoke which act as monoamine oxidase inhibitors in the brain can alter mood and have a calming effect, depending on dose. =Stimulants= A number of clinical studies have shown a positive association between caffeine ingestion and panic disorder and/or anxiogenic effects. People who have panic disorder are more sensitive to the anxiety-provoking effects of caffeine. One of the major anxiety-provoking effects of caffeine is an increase in heart rate. Certain cold and flu medications containing decongestants may also contain pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, phenylephrine, naphazoline and oxymetazoline. These may be avoided by the use of decongestants formulated to prevent causing high blood pressure. =Alcohol and sedatives= About 30% of people with panic disorder use alcohol and 17% use other psychoactive drugs. This is in comparison with 61% (alcohol) and 7.9% (other psychoactive drugs) of the general population who use alcohol and psychoactive drugs, respectively. Utilization of recreational drugs or alcohol generally make symptoms worse. Most stimulant drugs (caffeine, nicotine, cocaine) would be expected to worsen the condition, since they directly increase the symptoms of panic, such as heart rate. Deacon and Valentiner (2000) conducted a study that examined co- morbid panic attacks and substance use in a non-clinical sample of young adults who experienced regular panic attacks. The authors found that compared to healthy controls, sedative use was greater for non-clinical participants who experienced panic attacks. These findings are consistent with the suggestion made by Cox, Norton, Dorward, and Fergusson (1989) that panic disorder patients self-medicate if they believe that certain substances will be successful in alleviating their symptoms. If panic disorder patients are indeed self-medicating, there may be a portion of the population with undiagnosed panic disorder who will not seek professional help as a result of their own self-medication. In fact, for some patients panic disorder is only diagnosed after they seek treatment for their self-medication habit. While alcohol initially helps ease panic disorder symptoms, medium- or long-term alcohol abuse can cause panic disorder to develop or worsen during alcohol intoxication, especially during alcohol withdrawal syndrome. This effect is not unique to alcohol but can also occur with long-term use of drugs which have a similar mechanism of action to alcohol such as the benzodiazepines which are sometimes prescribed as tranquilizers to people with alcohol problems. The reason chronic alcohol misuse worsens panic disorder is due to distortion of the brain chemistry and function. Approximately 10% of patients will experience notable protracted withdrawal symptoms, which can include panic disorder, after discontinuation of benzodiazepines. Protracted withdrawal symptoms tend to resemble those seen during the first couple of months of withdrawal but usually are of a subacute level of severity compared to the symptoms seen during the first 2 or 3 months of withdrawal. It is not known definitively whether such symptoms persisting long after withdrawal are related to true pharmacological withdrawal or whether they are due to structural neuronal damage as result of chronic use of benzodiazepines or withdrawal. Nevertheless, such symptoms do typically lessen as the months and years go by eventually disappearing altogether. A significant proportion of patients attending mental health services for conditions including anxiety disorders such as panic disorder or social phobia have developed these conditions as a result of alcohol or sedative abuse. Anxiety may pre-exist alcohol or sedative dependence, which then acts to perpetuate or worsen the underlying anxiety disorder. Someone suffering the toxic effects of alcohol abuse or chronic sedative use or abuse will not benefit from other therapies or medications for underlying psychiatric conditions as they do not address the root cause of the symptoms. Recovery from sedative symptoms may temporarily worsen during alcohol withdrawal or benzodiazepine withdrawal. Mechanism The neuroanatomy of panic disorder largely overlaps with that of most anxiety disorders. Neuropsychological, neurosurgical, and neuroimaging studies implicate the insula, amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), lateral prefrontal cortex, and periaqueductal grey. During acute panic attacks, viewing emotionally charged words, and rest, most studies find elevated blood flow or metabolism. However, the observation of amygdala hyperactivity is not entirely consistent, especially in studies that evoke panic attacks chemically. Hippocampus hyperactivity has been observed during rest and viewing emotionally charged pictures, which has been hypothesized to be related to memory retrieval bias towards anxious memories. Insula hyperactivity during the onset of and over the course of acute panic episodes is thought to be related to abnormal introceptive processes; the perception that bodily sensations are \\"wrong\\" is a transdiagnostic finding(i.e. found across multiple anxiety disorders), and may be related to insula dysfunction. Rodent and human studies heavily implicate the periaqueductal grey in generating fear responses, and abnormalities related to the structure and metabolism in the PAG have been reported in panic disorder. The frontal cortex is implicated in panic disorder by multiple lines of evidence. Damage to the dorsal ACC has been reported to lead to panic disorder. Elevated ventral ACC and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during symptom provocation and viewing emotional stimuli have also been reported, although findings are not consistent. Researchers studying some individuals with panic disorder propose they may have a chemical imbalance within the limbic system and one of its regulatory chemicals GABA-A. The reduced production of GABA-A sends false information to the amygdala which regulates the body's \\"fight or flight\\" response mechanism and, in return, produces the physiological symptoms that lead to the disorder. Clonazepam, an anticonvulsant benzodiazepine with a long half-life, has been successful in keeping the condition under control. Recently, researchers have begun to identify mediators and moderators of aspects of panic disorder. One such mediator is the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, which mediates the relationship between panic disorder patients receiving breathing training and anxiety sensitivity; thus, breathing training affects the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in a patient's arterial blood, which in turn lowers anxiety sensitivity. Another mediator is hypochondriacal concerns, which mediate the relationship between anxiety sensitivity and panic symptomatology; thus, anxiety sensitivity affects hypochondriacal concerns which, in turn, affect panic symptomatology. Perceived threat control has been identified as a moderator within panic disorder, moderating the relationship between anxiety sensitivity and agoraphobia; thus, the level of perceived threat control dictates the degree to which anxiety sensitivity results in agoraphobia. Another recently identified moderator of panic disorder is genetic variations in the gene coding for galanin; these genetic variations moderate the relationship between females suffering from panic disorder and the level of severity of panic disorder symptomatology. Diagnosis The DSM- IV-TR diagnostic criteria for panic disorder require unexpected, recurrent panic attacks, followed in at least one instance by at least a month of a significant and related behavior change, a persistent concern of more attacks, or a worry about the attack's consequences. There are two types, one with and one without agoraphobia. Diagnosis is excluded by attacks due to a drug or medical condition, or by panic attacks that are better accounted for by other mental disorders. The ICD-10 diagnostic criteria: The essential feature is recurrent attacks of severe anxiety (panic), which are not restricted to any particular situation or set of circumstances and are therefore unpredictable. The dominant symptoms include: * sudden onset of palpitations *chest pain *choking sensations *dizziness * feelings of unreality (depersonalization or derealization) * secondary fear of dying, losing control, or going mad Panic disorder should not be given as the main diagnosis if the person has a depressive disorder at the time the attacks start; in these circumstances, the panic attacks are probably secondary to depression.http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2015/en#/F41.0 The Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) is a questionnaire for measuring the severity of panic disorder. Treatment Panic disorder is a serious health problem that in many cases can be successfully treated, although there is no known cure. Identification of treatments that engender as full a response as possible, and can minimize relapse, is imperative. Cognitive behavioral therapy and positive self-talk specific for panic are the treatments of choice for panic disorder. Several studies show that 85 to 90 percent of panic disorder patients treated with CBT recover completely from their panic attacks within 12 weeks. When cognitive behavioral therapy is not an option, pharmacotherapy can be used. SSRIs are considered a first-line pharmacotherapeutic option. Psychotherapy Panic disorder is not the same as phobic symptoms, although phobias commonly result from panic disorder. CBT and one tested form of psychodynamic psychotherapy have been shown efficacious in treating panic disorder with and without agoraphobia. A number of randomized clinical trials have shown that CBT achieves reported panic-free status in 70‚Äì90% of patients about 2 years after treatment. A 2009 Cochrane review found little evidence concerning the efficacy of psychotherapy in combination with benzodiazepines such that recommendations could not be made. Symptom inductions generally occur for one minute and may include: *Intentional hyperventilation ‚Äì creates lightheadedness, derealization, blurred vision, dizziness *Spinning in a chair ‚Äì creates dizziness, disorientation *Straw breathing ‚Äì creates dyspnea, airway constriction *Breath holding ‚Äì creates sensation of being out of breath *Running in place ‚Äì creates increased heart rate, respiration, perspiration *Body tensing ‚Äì creates feelings of being tense and vigilant Another form of psychotherapy which has shown effectiveness in controlled clinical trials is panic-focused psychodynamic psychotherapy, which focuses on the role of dependency, separation anxiety, and anger in causing panic disorder. The underlying theory posits that due to biochemical vulnerability, traumatic early experiences, or both, people with panic disorder have a fearful dependence on others for their sense of security, which leads to separation anxiety and defensive anger. Therapy involves first exploring the stressors that lead to panic episodes, then probing the psychodynamics of the conflicts underlying panic disorder and the defense mechanisms that contribute to the attacks, with attention to transference and separation anxiety issues implicated in the therapist-patient relationship. Comparative clinical studies suggest that muscle relaxation techniques and breathing exercises are not efficacious in reducing panic attacks. In fact, breathing exercises may actually increase the risk of relapse. Appropriate treatment by an experienced professional can prevent panic attacks or at least substantially reduce their severity and frequency‚Äîbringing significant relief to percent of people with panic disorder. Relapses may occur, but they can often be effectively treated just like the initial episode. vanApeldoorn, F.J. et al. (2011) demonstrated the additive value of a combined treatment incorporating an SSRI treatment intervention with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). Gloster et al. (2011) went on to examine the role of the therapist in CBT. They randomized patients into two groups: one being treated with CBT in a therapist guided environment, and the second receiving CBT through instruction only, with no therapist guided sessions. The findings indicated that the first group had a somewhat better response rate, but that both groups demonstrated a significant improvement in reduction of panic symptomatology. These findings lend credibility to the application of CBT programs to patients who are unable to access therapeutic services due to financial, or geographic inaccessibility. Koszycky et al. (2011) discuss the efficacy of self-administered cognitive behavioural therapy (SCBT) in situations where patients are unable to retain the services of a therapist. Their study demonstrates that it is possible for SCBT in combination with an SSRI to be as effective as therapist-guided CBT with SSRI. Each of these studies contributes to a new avenue of research that allows effective treatment interventions to be made more easily accessible to the population. =Cognitive behavioral therapy= Cognitive behavioral therapy encourages patients to confront the triggers that induce arouse their anxiety. By facing the very cause of the anxiety, it is thought to help diminish the irrational fears that are causing the issues to begin with. The therapy begins with calming breathing exercises, followed by noting the changes in physical sensations felt as soon as anxiety begins to enter the body. Many clients are encouraged to keep journals. In other cases, therapists may try and induce feelings of anxiety so that the root of the fear can be identified. Comorbid clinical depression, personality disorders and alcohol abuse are known risk factors for treatment failure. As with many disorders, having a support structure of family and friends who understand the condition can help increase the rate of recovery. During an attack, it is not uncommon for the sufferer to develop irrational, immediate fear, which can often be dispelled by a supporter who is familiar with the condition. For more serious or active treatment, there are support groups for anxiety sufferers which can help people understand and deal with the disorder. Current treatment guidelines American Psychiatric Association and the American Medical Association primarily recommend either cognitive-behavioral therapy or one of a variety of psychopharmacological interventions. Some evidence exists supporting the superiority of combined treatment approaches. Another option is self-help based on principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Using a book or a website, a person does the kinds of exercises that would be used in therapy, but they do it on their own, perhaps with some email or phone support from a therapist. A systematic analysis of trials testing this kind of self-help found that websites, books, and other materials based on cognitive-behavioral therapy could help some people. The best-studied conditions are panic disorder and social phobia. =Interoceptive techniques= Interoceptive exposure is sometimes used for panic disorder. People's interoceptive triggers of anxiety are evaluated one-by-one before conducting interoceptive exposures, such as addressing palpitation sensitivity via light exercise. Though this practice is used in 12‚Äì20% of cases. Medication Appropriate medications are effective for panic disorder. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are first line treatments rather than benzodiazapines due to concerns with the latter regarding tolerance, dependence and abuse. Although there is little evidence that pharmacological interventions can directly alter phobias, few studies have been performed, and medication treatment of panic makes phobia treatment far easier (an example in Europe where only 8% of patients receive appropriate treatment). Medications can include: * Antidepressants (SSRIs, MAOIs, tricyclic antidepressants and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) * Antianxiety agents (benzodiazepines): Use of benzodiazepines for panic disorder is controversial. The American Psychiatric Association states that benzodiazepines can be effective for the treatment of panic disorder and recommends that the choice of whether to use benzodiazepines, antidepressants with anti-panic properties or psychotherapy should be based on the individual patient's history and characteristics. Other experts believe that benzodiazepines are best avoided due to the risks of the development of tolerance and physical dependence. The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry, say that benzodiazepines should not be used as a first- line treatment option but are an option for treatment-resistant cases of panic disorder. Despite increasing focus on the use of antidepressants and other agents for the treatment of anxiety as recommended best practice, benzodiazepines have remained a commonly used medication for panic disorder. They reported that in their view there is insufficient evidence to recommend one treatment over another for panic disorder. The APA noted that while benzodiazepines have the advantage of a rapid onset of action, that this is offset by the risk of developing a benzodiazepine dependence. The National Institute of Clinical Excellence came to a different conclusion, they pointed out the problems of using uncontrolled clinical trials to assess the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy and based on placebo-controlled research they concluded that benzodiazepines were not effective in the long-term for panic disorder and recommended that benzodiazepines not be used for longer than 4 weeks for panic disorder. Instead NICE clinical guidelines recommend alternative pharmacotherapeutic or psychotherapeutic interventions. When compared to placebos, benzodiazepines demonstrate possible superiority in the short term but the evidence is low quality with limited applicability to clinical practice. Other treatments For some people, anxiety can be greatly reduced by discontinuing the use of caffeine. Anxiety can temporarily increase during caffeine withdrawal. Epidemiology Age-standardized disability-adjusted life year rates for panic disorder per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004. Panic disorder typically begins during early adulthood; roughly half of all people who have panic disorder develop the condition between the ages of 17 and 24, especially those subjected to traumatic experiences. However, some studies suggest that the majority of young people affected for the first time are between the ages of 25 and 30. Women are twice as likely as men to develop panic disorder and it occurs far more often in people with above average intelligence. Panic disorder can continue for months or years, depending on how and when treatment is sought. If left untreated, it may worsen to the point where one's life is seriously affected by panic attacks and by attempts to avoid or conceal the condition. In fact, many people have had problems with personal relationships, education and employment while struggling to cope with panic disorder. Some people with panic disorder may conceal their condition because of the stigma of mental illness. In some individuals, symptoms may occur frequently for a period of months or years, then many years may pass with little or no symptoms. In some cases, the symptoms persist at the same level indefinitely. There is also some evidence that many individuals (especially those who develop symptoms at an early age) may experience symptom cessation later in life (e.g., past age 50). In 2000, the World Health Organization found prevalence and incidence rates for panic disorder to be very similar across the globe. Age-standardized prevalence per 100,000 ranged from 309 in Africa to 330 in East Asia for men and from 613 in Africa to 649 in North America, Oceania, and Europe for women. Children A retrospective study has shown that 40% of adult panic disorder patients reported that their disorder began before the age of 20. In an article examining the phenomenon of panic disorder in youth, Diler et al. (2004) found that only a few past studies have examined the occurrence of juvenile panic disorder. They report that these studies have found that the symptoms of juvenile panic disorder almost replicate those found in adults (e.g. heart palpitations, sweating, trembling, hot flashes, nausea, abdominal distress, and chills). The anxiety disorders co-exist with staggeringly high numbers of other mental disorders in adults. The same comorbid disorders that are seen in adults are also reported in children with juvenile panic disorder. Last and Strauss (1989) examined a sample of 17 adolescents with panic disorder and found high rates of comorbid anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, and conduct disorders. Eassau et al. (1999) also found a high number of comorbid disorders in a community-based sample of adolescents with panic attacks or juvenile panic disorder. Within the sample, adolescents were found to have the following comorbid disorders: major depressive disorder (80%), dysthymic disorder (40%), generalized anxiety disorder (40%), somatoform disorders (40%), substance abuse (40%), and specific phobia (20%). Consistent with this previous work, Diler et al. (2004) found similar results in their study in which 42 youths with juvenile panic disorder were examined. Compared to non-panic anxiety disordered youths, children with panic disorder had higher rates of comorbid major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. Children differ from adolescents and adults in their interpretation and ability to express their experience. Like adults, children experience physical symptoms including accelerated heart rate, sweating, trembling or shaking, shortness of breath, nausea or stomach pain, dizziness or light-headedness. In addition, children also experience cognitive symptoms like fear of dying, feelings of being detached from oneself, feelings of losing control or going crazy, but they are unable to vocalize these higher order manifestations of fear. They simply know that something is going wrong and that they are very afraid. Children can only describe the physical symptoms. They have not yet developed the constructs to put these symptoms together and label them as fear. Parents often feel helpless when they watch a child suffer. They can help children give a name to their experience, and empower them to overcome the fear they are experiencing The role of the parent in treatment and intervention for children diagnosed with panic disorder is discussed by McKay & Starch (2011). They point out that there are several levels at which parental involvement should be considered. The first involves the initial assessment. Parents, as well as the child, should be screened for attitudes and treatment goals, as well as for levels of anxiety or conflict in the home. The second involves the treatment process in which the therapist should meet with the family as a unit as frequently as possible. Ideally, all family members should be aware and trained in the process of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) in order to encourage the child to rationalize and face fears rather than employ avoidant safety behaviors. McKay & Storch (2011) suggest training/modeling of therapeutic techniques and in session involvement of the parents in the treatment of children to enhance treatment efficacy. Despite the evidence pointing to the existence of early-onset panic disorder, the DSM- IV-TR currently only recognizes six anxiety disorders in children: separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, obsessive- compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder (a.k.a. social phobia), and post- traumatic stress disorder. Panic disorder is notably excluded from this list.

Since 2005, Ecuador has been greatly involved in sports and hosted the Guayaquil Marathon in Ecuador's largest city. Football LDU Quito. Football is the most popular sport in Ecuador. Its best known professional teams include Barcelona and Emelec from Guayaquil, LDU Quito, Deportivo Quito, and El Nacional from Quito, Olmedo from Riobamba, and Deportivo Cuenca from Cuenca. The national team's matches are the most watched sporting events in the country. In June 2007, FIFA adopted a resolution, prohibiting international football games at or higher than 2,500m above sea level. Ecuador, Bolivia and other South American countries issued a joint letter of protest against this ruling. Ecuador qualified for the finals tournaments of both the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cup. Ecuador finished ahead of Poland and Costa Rica, to come second to Germany in Group A, in the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Tennis Nicol√°s Lapentti There is a considerable interest in tennis in the middle and upper classes in Ecuadorian society, and several Ecuadorian professional players have attained national fame, including Nicol√°s Lapentti, Francisco Segura, and Andr√©s G√≥mez. As of 2015, Ecuador hosts an ATP World Tour 250 series event, the Ecuador Open Quito as part of the South-American summer clay-court circuit. Olympics Ecuador has competed in eleven Summer Olympic Games. They participated in the Winter Olympic Games for the first time in 2018. The nation from South America won its first Olympic medal, when Jefferson P√©rez won the gold medal in the Men's 20 km Walk. The Ecuadorian Olympic Committee was created in 1948 and recognized by the IOC in 1959. Other sports Basketball has a high profile, especially at amateur (high school and college) level as an alternative to football. It is sometimes considered as the second sport behind football; Ecuador even took part in the inaugural 1950 FIBA World Championship, finishing 8th out of 10 teams. There are regional leagues and a national league, which include clubs and teams from colleges as well. One of Ecuador's specialties includes ecuav√≥ley, a three-person variation of volleyball with more relaxed rules (the ball can be hit with the palm of the hand, and a football is traditionally used). Rugby union is found to some extent in Ecuador, with teams in Guayaquil, Quito, and Cuenca. Pelota nacional, an indigenous racquet sport, is also played. Surfing is popular in some coastal towns. Winter sports are very popular in the Andes mountains, which have the most suitable climate for them. There is flourishing activity in non-traditional sports such as inline hockey, capoeira, mountain biking, motorbiking, whitewater kayaking, skiing, snowboarding, and paintball. Martin Davalos, from Pichincha, Quito, is a well-known accomplished AMA motocross and supercross dirtbike rider and racer. In cycling, Richard Carapaz became the first Ecuadorian to win a Grand Tour. He won the 2019 Giro d'Italia Some coastal resorts, particularly Monta√±ita and Ayampe, have been developed as surfing centres. The 2005 World Rafting Championships were held on the Quijos River in Napo Province. Ecuador also hosted the 2007 Youth World Championship for rock climbing, held in Ibarra, becoming the first country outside of Europe or Asia to host the event.

Further remains were recovered in the first years after the war, while cleaning up the battlefields. Even to this day, when major earth movements reveal World War I-era bodies, the dead are re-interred here. The army units of those who rest in Vermandovillers derive from all countries and provinces of the former German Empire. Interwar period Initial work on improving the condition of the cemetery arose through establishment of the German War-Care Association in 1927/28, through an agreement with French Army. Trees and shrubs were planted, the cemetery area was bordered with stone walls, and the common graves were marked with wild roses. However, the problem of establishing permanent grave markers remained unresolved due to currency inflation, the Great Depression and the outbreak of World War II. Final design On completion of the Franco-German War Graves Agreement, the German War Graves Commission was charged with the final design of all German military cemeteries in France dating from the time of World War I. Starting in 1964, National Association of North Rhine-Westphalia youth camp participants began leveling, soil improvement and replanting on the property, including new layouts for the graves. In 1979, permanent cast-metal markers with the names and dates of those at rest were installed to replace the temporary wooden markers. The Bundeswehr erected the concrete foundations for the metal crosses largely according to survey markings by participants in the National Association youth camps. Of the 9,455 individual graves in this cemetery, those of 379 at rest remain unknown, while an additional 13,200 dead are interred in 15 mass graves. In lieu of crosses, the graves of 32 Jewish soldiers were given stone markers whose translated Hebrew inscription reads: \\"Here lies buried XXX, May his soul be woven into the circle of the living.\\" Communal graves are marked with heavy stone crosses and metal plaques affixed on the outer walls bearing the names of those who are known. A high forged- steel cross stands in the center of the cemetery. There has been a fundamental review of landscaping, with grave area plantings, the establishment of new trees and shrubs, and overall maintenance of existing stock. Two famous literary figures rest in the common graves; the Roman Catholic war poet and playwright Reinhard Johannes Sorge, and the Expressionist writer Alfred Lichtenstein (writer).

The Quebec education system is unique in North America. The college level is a separate and distinct step in Quebec. For students graduating from secondary school in Quebec, a college diploma is required for admission into university. In the rest of Canada, colleges have historically been technical schools that offer specialized professional or vocational education in specific employment fields. College Education Quebec high school starts at grade 7 and ends at grade 11, one year earlier than in English North America. Most Quebec university programs are three years in length. With a collegiate level between high school and university bridging the gap: : English system 1-8 + 9-12 + 4 University = 16 years : Quebec system 1-6 + 7-11 + 2 College + 3 University = 16 years Two main college paths are possible: Pre-University programs of two years, leading to a college diploma required for university admissions. Specialized vocational programs of either three years‚Äîleading to a college diploma and entry to the job market, with a possibility of university admissions‚Äîor one year, leading to a college certificate and direct entry into the workforce. Types of colleges There are three types of colleges in Quebec: public colleges, private colleges, and government colleges. Public colleges The majority of college students attend a public General and Vocational College, also known as the French acronym \\"cegep\\" (). These colleges do not charge tuition to Quebec residents, although small administrative fees are charged. Private colleges A large number of private colleges also exist at the collegiate level. Some of these schools receive funding from the government, others do not, and therefore tuition can vary greatly between schools.

They consist of South Parkway, East Parkway, and North Parkway. Designed by George Kessler, the Parkway System connects Martin Luther King Jr. Riverside Park with Overton Park. The system was put on the National Register of Historic Places on July 3, 1989.  History  Kessler's plan for Overton Park. North Parkway is to the north (labeled Summer Avenue) and East Parkway is to the east (labeled Trezevant Street). In response to the yellow fever epidemic and in an attempt to revitalize Memphis, the city's leaders decided to improve the city's infrastructure, including improving sewer systems, creating public utilities, and creating a system of parks connected by a system of boulevards. Starting in 1897, several areas of land were annexed into the city, along with the areas that now comprise the parks mentioned above. These lands were purchased in 1901. In that same year, the city selected George Kessler to lay out this new plan. Planning and construction of the Lea's Woods tract of land (now known as Overton Park) was started in 1902 and completed in the same year. The development and construction of Wilderberger Farm (now known as Martin Luther King Jr. Riverside Park) started in the same year, but finished a year later in 1903. The development and construction of what is now known as the Parkway System started in 1904. The project had been delayed due to a lawsuit stating the government was using its power of eminent domain incorrectly, but the Tennessee Supreme Court found in favor of the city. Instead of a winding system of meandering parkways, Kessler decided to create a rectangular border around the city of Memphis using some existing streets. South Parkway and East Parkway (originally Trezevant Street) were constructed first. North Parkway was originally known as Summer Avenue (the name still carried by the route as it continues east from the intersection of North and East Parkways). North Parkway was also known as Speedway. Kessler originally designed parts of the Parkway System to be straight portions of tree-lined avenues where car and carriage owners could race against each other. However, the city of Memphis ended this practice in 1910 and imposed a speed limit on the entire system. Today, the road's racing past can still be seen in the name of the Speedway Terrace Historical District along North Parkway near Watkins Street. The entire parkway system was completed in 1906. After its completion, residential development along its route increased. Many cities in Tennessee used Memphis' park and parkway system as a model for their own urban planning. The Parkway System roughly marked the city's boundaries for many years to come and is still an important corridor in the city of Memphis.TN Encyclopedia: MEMPHIS PARK AND PARKWAY SYSTEMWKNO-TV Documentary Memphis Memoirs: Beyond The Parkways  Route Description  Moving in a counter-clockwise direction from the southwest corner, the Parkway System starts at Martin Luther King Jr. Riverside Park. It crosses Interstate 55 next to the park and continues east. This portion, known as South Parkway West, is a four-lane undivided road through an industrial area with no boulevard median or landscaping. After crossing Interstate 240/Interstate 69, the section known as South Parkway East becomes divided with a wooded boulevard median, like the majority of the parkways. South Parkway, after passing U.S. Highway 78 (Lamar Avenue), turns into East Parkway South. Temporarily, the route's name reverts to South Parkway East, as it turns eastbound and intersects with South Cooper St. and East McLemore Avenue. South Parkway East becomes East Parkway South once again at its intersection with Airways Boulevard and Spottswood Avenue. It also picks up the designation of State Route 277. East Parkway South continues north until it crosses under Union Avenue and (two blocks later) becomes East Parkway North. At this point, it picks up U.S. Highway 64, U.S. Highway 70, U.S. Highway 79, and U.S. Highway 72, in addition to keeping the SR 277 designation. When it passes Poplar Avenue, Hwy 72 goes to the east, but it picks up the State Route 57 designation. At this point, it passes to the east of Overton Park and intersects with Sam Cooper Boulevard. When East Parkway meets North Parkway, it loses all of the above-mentioned U.S. highways to the east (Summer Avenue) and the state highways to the north (Trezevant Street). However North Parkway picks up the State Route 1 designation and is one of the only sections in the state to have this route signed. North Parkway continues west, crosses Interstate 40, and ends at U.S. Highway 51/State Route 3/State Route 14 (Danny Thomas Boulevard). The road continues west as A.W. Willis Avenue, crossing the Wolf River Harbor, and ending on Mud Island. Except for the South Parkway West section, the entire system is divided by a large median containing several trees, most of them very large and mature, and sections of flowered landscaping. South Parkway has two lanes in each direction and bike/parking lanes along portions of it. East Parkways has three lanes in each direction (except for when the routes pass under other roadways, in which case each direction narrows to two lanes, and the four northbound lanes of East Parkway between Poplar and Sam Cooper). North Parkway had 3 lanes in each direction until the mid 2010s when bike/parking lanes were added between Manassas and West Drive. The entire system has a forty-mile-per-hour speed limit. A section of the median of East Parkway was designated \\"Flowering Tree Trail\\" in 1956/57.  Landmarks  Below is a list of landmarks within close proximity of the parkways.

The Russell Ranch field is about seven miles (11 km) west-northwest of the town of New Cuyama. The total productive area is about , and the field is about five miles (8 km) long by one-half mile across, with the long axis trending approximately northwest to southeast, beginning at Whiterock Bluff in the Caliente Range, crossing under the Cuyama River, and ending in the foothills of the Sierra Madre Mountains.Barger, R.M. and J.L. Zulberti. Russell Ranch Oil Field: California Division of Oil and Gas, Summary of Operations. 1952. Vol. 38 No. 2. pp. 5-6. The Cuyama River, and California State Route 166 which parallels the river, cut through the center of the field; travelers on Route 166 have a brief view of oil storage tanks and several pumpjacks, but most of the oilfield operations are out of sight from the public right-of-way. Elevations on the field range from around where the river cuts across the field, to around at the southern end in the hills. Terrain consists of an alluvial plain around the river, and grass- and brush- covered hills, cut by numerous gullies and badlands, at both ends of the field in the lower portion of the Caliente and Sierra Madre mountains. Climate is Mediterranean, but modified by the distance from the coast; winters are colder, with occasional freezes, and summertime temperatures sometimes top . Drainage is to the Cuyama River, which flows out to the ocean at Guadalupe. In the vicinity of the oil field, the predominant land use, aside from activities associated with oil production and storage, is cattle grazing. The bottomlands of the Cuyama Valley, adjacent to the field on the east-southeast, are primarily agricultural. Geology Unlike many oil fields in central California, the Russell Ranch field is not an anticlinal formation with an obvious surface expression ‚Äì indeed the geologic formation containing oil is quite invisible from the ground surface, being covered with alluvium and masked by the mountain ranges running almost perpendicular to the oil field. The oil is in a large homocline, including porous sedimentary units dipping northeast and essentially planar, which terminate at the Russell Fault, a normal fault with an approximately vertical offset which has barricaded upwards movement of hydrocarbons against impermeable rock of Pliocene age. The oil-bearing rocks in the homocline ‚Äì the Santa Margarita and Vaqueros Formations, of late and early Miocene age respectively ‚Äì are sandstones with a porosity of between 23 and 32 percent.California Department of Conservation, Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR). California Oil and Gas Fields, Volumes I, II and III. Vol. I (1998), Vol. II (1992), Vol. III (1982). PDF file available on CD from www.consrv.ca.gov. p. 440 The oil field has four separate pools or producing horizons within its main area, and one small pool in another area about one-half mile southeast of the main part of the field. The four pools in the main area, all discovered in 1948 and 1949, are the Santa Margarita, in the formation of the same name, of late Miocene age; and the Dibblee, Griggs-Dibblee, and Colgrove, all in the Vaqueros Formation of early Miocene age. The pool in the Southeast Area is also in the Dibblee Sand of the Vaqueros Formation. Depths of the pools range from below ground surface in the Santa Margarita to 3,600 in the Dibblee Sand in the Southeast area, and oil is of medium grade, with API gravity ranging from 25 to 40. Sulfur content is generally low, with values from 0.26 to 0.46 percent in each of the pools.DOGGR, p. 440-441 History, production, and operations Cluster of active oil wells in the Russell Ranch field, south of SR 166. The Russell Ranch field was the first to be found in the Cuyama Valley. Prospectors had long suspected the presence of oil there ‚Äì after all, almost all the surrounding basins were full of oil fields, which only needed to be found by drilling deep enough ‚Äì but early boreholes found nothing of commercial value. A well drilled in the 1920s near the western edge of the field found nothing, and wells drilled in 1945‚Äì6 found traces of oil sands, a promising sign. Norris Oil Company put in the discovery well on January 1, 1948, which produced ; unfortunately the production turned to water quickly, and prospectors began looking for a more favorable location. Richfield Oil Company, an ancestor of ARCO (now BP), put in the well which found the most productive area of the field, drilling to a depth of into the Dibblee Sand (named for Thomas Dibblee, the geologist who led Richfield to explore for oil in the Cuyama Valley). This well produced over , and many more wells followed; each of the producing horizons had been discovered before 1950, and by July 1, 1950, there were 142 producing wells on the field. The success of the Russell Ranch field development led quickly to the discovery of the South Cuyama field about seven miles (11 km) to the southeast, in 1949; this field proved to have over three times the oil of the Russell Ranch field, and remains the largest in the Cuyama Valley.DOGGR 2009, p. 63 The field reached its peak production in 1950, when of oil were withdrawn from the reservoir. Inevitably, production declined, and field operators employed several enhanced recovery technologies to increase reservoir pressure and keep the wells flowing.

Inferno: The Fire Bombing of Japan, March 9 ‚Äì August 15, 1945 Background Although the city of Aomori lacked major targets of military significance and was a minor city in terms of population, it was a prefectural capital and a major regional transportation hub. Aomori Station was the northern terminus for the T≈çhoku Main Line and ≈åu Main Line railways, and Aomori Port was the primary base for the Seikan Ferry connecting Honshu with Hokkaid≈ç. In terms of military industry, the city had a factory owned by Toyo Seikan, which manufactured wings and landing gear for aircraft.United States Strategic Bombing Survey. Summary Report(Pacific War) July 1, 1946 Air raids On the night of July 27, 1945, two Boeing B-29 Superfortresses dropped flares and a total of 60,000 leaflets on the city of Aomori. The leaflets, depicting a bomber dropping bombs, listed 11 cities (including Aomori), and stated that at least 5-6 of these cities would soon be destroyed, and urged the civilian population to leave. As in other cities, the Japanese government decreed that citizens must turn such leaflets over to the police without reading the contents on pain of 3 months imprisonment or a fine of 10 Yen. Discussion of the contents could result in indefinite imprisonment, and the restrictions were to be enforced by the kempeitai and local tonarigumi. On the night of July 28‚Äì29, 1945, 63 B-29 bombers from the USAAF 58th Bombardment Wing departed from Iwo Jima, with their flight routing via Sendai and the Oga Peninsula, approaching Aomori via Ajigasawa village. One aircraft was forced back, but the remaining 63 arrived over Aomori at 22:10 and commenced a firebombing attack with E-48 500 lbs incendiary bombs on the central part of the city from an altitude of 5000 feet, lasting until 23:10.Carter.

Formerly known as the Semitropic Gas Field, it was discovered by the Standard Oil Company of California in 1935, and first understood to be primarily a natural gas reservoir; however, in 1956 a much deeper oil-bearing zone was discovered. The field contains the deepest oil well ever drilled in California, at . p. 61. While deeper boreholes have been drilled, this is the deepest that had ever been converted into a productive oil well. It was abandoned in 1975. At the end of 2008 the field still had 56 active oil wells, most of which were owned by Occidental Petroleum, and the field had an estimated 343,000 barrels of oil still recoverable with current technology.DOGGR 2009, p. 101. Setting The Semitropic field is one of the oil and gas fields in the southern San Joaquin Valley which is underneath the bottomlands of the valley, rather than in the hills which surround it. Most of the largest fields are in the lower parts of the foothills to the mountains on either side of the valley, including monstrous reservoirs such as the Kern River and Midway- Sunset fields; in the bottomlands, the fields are more deeply buried and harder to find, as they have no surface geological expression, such as a line of hills indicating an anticlinal structure hiding an oil reservoir. Like many of the fields on the west side of the valley, it is an elongate dome aligned from northwest to southeast. The field is about seven miles (11 km) long by two across, at the widest point, and has a productive area of .California Department of Conservation, Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR). California Oil and Gas Fields, Volumes I, II and III. Vol. I (1998), Vol. II (1992), Vol. III (1982). PDF file available on CD from www.consrv.ca.gov. p. 394-395 The field parallels Interstate 5 about five miles (8 km) to the northeast. California State Route 46, the Paso Robles Highway, cuts across the northern extremity of the field from east to west, about east of Lost Hills. The town of Wasco is about eight miles (13 km) farther east along the same route. Several small abandoned oil and gas fields adjoin the Semitropic field from the southeast to the southwest, and the small Wasco Oil Field (with only three wells remaining active) is immediately adjacent to the east. The nearest large and still active oil field is the Lost Hills field, about to the west-northwest. Terrain in the vicinity of the oil field is almost table-flat, with elevations ranging from approximately 250 to above sea level throughout the productive region, with a very slight gradient from south to north towards the Tulare Lake bed. The Semitropic Ridge, a gentle topographic prominence with a mean elevation of about twenty feet above the oil field, parallels the field to the southwest, separating it from Interstate 5. Climate is typical of the valley bottom in the south, which is arid. Temperatures in the summer routinely exceed on typically cloudless days. Rain falls mainly in the winter months, and averages 5 to . Freezes occur occasionally during the winter, and the winter months are also subject to frequent dense tule fogs, limiting visibility to near zero. Drainage from the field in generally into the irrigation canal system, but because of the flat surface gradient most rainfall soaks directly into the ground. Land use in the vicinity of the field is predominantly agricultural, with oil and gas production, storage, and transportation infrastructure interspersed with orchards and row crops. Little native vegetation remains as all the land has been converted to agricultural use. Roads cross the region at right angles, following township, range, and section lines, as do irrigation canals. Geology The Semitropic field resembles the other three natural gas reservoirs in the southern San Joaquin Valley ‚Äì the Buttonwillow, Trico, and Paloma gas fields ‚Äì in being a northwest-to-southeast trending ellipsoidal dome, with the topmost unit containing commercial quantities of gas within a geologic formation known as the San Joaquin Clay.Kaplow, E.J. Gas Fields of Southern San Joaquin Valley. California Oil Fields, 24th Annual Report, Vol. 24 No. 1. San Francisco, 1938. p. 30. None of this geologic structure is visible on the ground surface since the Central Valley is wide and flat, but enough wells had been drilled in the general vicinity to give early prospectors the idea that a petroleum reservoir might be nearby. Underneath several hundred feet of Holocene-age alluvium, deposited by thousands of years of runoff from the mountains that ring the Central Valley, is the Pleistocene Tulare Formation, which forms an impermeable cap to the underlying San Joaquin Clay, the principal gas-bearing unit. This unit varies in thickness from 2,200 to , and has an average porosity of 28%.DOGGR, p. 394-395 Drillers of early boreholes had determined that deeper formations contained oil, but since it never flowed, those prospectors guessed that the permeability of the units was insufficient for the field ever to be commercially viable.Kaplow, p. 41 Wells drilled in 1956 and subsequent years, however, proved this wrong. Underneath the San Joaquin Clay is the Etchegoin Formation, which contains the Randolph Pool, a unit which turned out to be moderately productive. Its average depth is and the oil-bearing, highly porous subunit has a thickness of about . Beneath this unit are several other rock units with no oil, including of the Monterey Formation; but underneath several other rock layers yet another oil pool was found in the Oligocene-age Vedder Sands, at a depth of . This unit produced from only a single well, from 1975 until it was abandoned in 1977, and was the deepest oil-producing unit ever exploited in California. Oil from this depth was light, with an API gravity of 42, and came up with a temperature of , along with a reservoir pressure of 8,200 psi.DOGGR, p. 395 History, production, and operations Active oil well on the Semitropic field, surrounded by orchards Richfield Oil Company, ancestor of ARCO and then part of BP, drilled the first well into the field in 1929, but the well was poorly placed and failed to find a commercially viable gas or oil zone.Kaplow, p. 37 Several other firms tried the area, with mixed luck: Shell Oil drilled a well all the way to , but both oil and gas failed to produce, though they showed in drill cuttings; Fullerton Oil drilled seven separate holes, one of which blew out ten million cubic feet of gas per day, but then stuck shut, and had to be abandoned. In 1935, Standard Oil Company of California finally was able to complete a gas well which was self-sustaining at 3,193 feet, and was therefore considered the discovery well for the field.Kaplow, p. 37-38 Peak gas production for the field was in 1942, and peak oil was in 1981. The field changed ownership several times in its history. Recent operators have included Pacific Energy Resources and Occidental Petroleum. Pacific Energy sold the field ‚Äì which amounted to 75 wells ‚Äì in October 2008 to Vintage Production, a subsidiary of Occidental. Vintage still runs the field as of early 2010.DOGGR 2009, p. 48 References Category:Oil fields in Kern County, California Category:Geography of the San Joaquin Valley ","title":"Semitropic Oil Field"},{"id":"26535194","text":"The Serbs have many traditions. The Slava is an exclusive custom of the Serbs, each family has one patron saint that they venerate on their feast day. The Serbian Orthodox Church uses the traditional Julian Calendar, as per which Christmas Day (December 25) falls currently on January 7 of the Gregorian Calendar, thus the Serbs celebrate Christmas on January 7, shared with the Orthodox churches of Jerusalem, Russia, Georgia, Ukraine and the Greek Old Calendarists. Hospitality Traditionally, honored guests in a Serbian home are greeted with bread and salt and/or a spoonful of Slatko. Furthermore, it is common for guests to bring something sweet to the host when going on a visit, even if they're only stopping by for a short time. Art=MusicFolklorSerbian Epic poetryChristian=Slava Slava prepared for a Serbian family feast in honour of their Patron Saint, John the Baptist. Slava (), also called krsna slava (–∫—Ä—Å–Ω–∞ —Å–ª–∞–≤–∞) and krsno ime (–∫—Ä—Å–Ω–æ –∏–º–µ, literally \\"christened name\\") is the Serbian Orthodox tradition of the veneration and observance of the family's patron saint. All Serbs celebrate Slava, every family has their own patron saint that they celebrate on the feast day. It is of pre-Christian origin. The most common feast days are St. Nicholas (falling on December 19), St. George (May 6, see ƒêurƒëevdan), St. John the Baptist (January 20), Saint Demetrius (November 8) and St. Michael (November 21). Given dates are by official Gregorian calendar. Serbian Orthodox Church uses Julian calendar that is late 13 days. For example, St. Nicholas date is December 6, but by Julian calendar this date is 13 days later, when by Gregorian calendar is December 19. =Vidovdan= Vidovdan (28 June) is sacred to ethnic Serbs (Serbian Orthodox Christians) and the cult was especially active among the South Slavs, who had transformed the pagan Slavic god Svetovid into the Sicilian martyr who exorcized the evil out of Diocletian's son. Through the centuries, Serbian historical events such as the defeat at the Battle of Kosovo became sources for spiritual strength and patriotism. It was not a coincidence that Gavrilo Princip assassinates the Austro-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand at Vidovdan, triggering the First World War. Vidovdan has long been considered a date of special importance to ethnic Serbs and the Balkans, the following events each took place on Vidovdan, but are expressed here in the Gregorian Calendar: * on June 28, 1389, the Ottoman Empire fought against Serbia in the Battle of Kosovo, and Serbian Prince Lazar was slain in battle. Ottoman Sultan Murad I was killed by Serbian knight Milo≈° Obiliƒá. * on June 28, 1914, the assassination of the Austro-Hungarian crown prince, Franz Ferdinand, triggers the First World War. * on June 28, 1919, the Treaty of Versailles was signed, ending World War I. * on June 28, 1921, the Serbian King Alexander I proclaimed the new Constitution of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, known thereafter as the Vidovdan Constitution (Vidovdanski ustav). * on June 28, 1948, the Cominform published, on the initiative of its Soviet delegates Zhdanov, Malenkov and Suslov, in a \\"Resolution on the State of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia\\" their condemnation of the Yugoslavian communist leaders - this happening is seen as the date that marks the final split between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. * on June 28, 1989, on the 600th anniversary of the battle of Kosovo, Serbian leader Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá delivered the Gazimestan speech at the site of the historic battle. * on June 28, 2001, Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá was deported to ICTY to stand trial. * on June 28, 2006, Montenegro was announced as the 192nd member state of the United Nations. * on June 28, 2008 was the inaugural meeting of the Community Assembly of Kosovo and Metohija. Christmas traditions The Serbs celebrate Christmas (, , ) -diminutive form of the word bog, meaning 'god', it refers to Jesus seeing as he is the son of god) for three consecutive days, beginning with Christmas Day. The Serbian Orthodox Church uses the traditional Julian Calendar, as per which Christmas Day (December 25) falls currently on January 7 of the Gregorian Calendar. This day is called by Serbs the first day of Christmas, and the following two are accordingly called the second, and the third day of Christmas. During this festive time, one is to greet another person with \\"Christ is Born,\\" which should be responded to with \\"Truly He is Born.\\"These greetings in (pronounced ) ‚Äì ‚Äû–í–∞–∏—Å—Ç–∏–Ω—É —Å–µ —Ä–æ–¥–∏‚Äú (). This holiday surpasses all the other celebrated by Serbs, with respect to the diversity of applied folk customs and rituals. These may vary from region to region, some of them having modern versions adapted to the contemporary way of living. The ideal environment to carry them out fully is the traditional multi-generation country household. In the morning of Christmas Eve a Serbian Badnjak Oak (sacred tree) is felled, and a log cut from it is in the evening ceremoniously put on the domestic fire. A bundle of straw is taken into the house and spread over the floor. The dinner on this day is festive, copious and diverse in foods, although it is prepared in accordance with the rules of fasting. Groups of young people go from house to house of their village or neighborhood, congratulating the holiday, singing, and making performances; this continues through the next three days. On Christmas Day, the celebration is announced at dawn by church bells and by shooting. A big importance is given to the first visit a family receives that day. People expect that it will summon prosperity and well-being for their household in the ensuing year; this visit is often pre-arranged. Christmas dinner is the most celebratory meal a family has during a year. A special, festive loaf of bread is baked for this occasion. The main course is roast pork which they cook whole by rotating it impaled on a wooden spit close to an open fire. It is not a part of Serbian traditions to exchange gifts during Christmas. Gift giving is, nevertheless, connected with the holiday, being traditionally done on the three consecutive Sundays that immediately precede it. Children, women, and men, respectively, are the set gift-givers on these three days. Closely related to Christmas is New Year's Day by the Julian calendar (January 14 on the Gregorian calendar), whose traditional folk name is Little Christmas. *Badnjak *Peƒçenica *Koleda, a custom of a group of young men, masked and costumed, goes from house to house of their village singing special koleda songs and performing acts of magic to summon health, wealth, and prosperity for each household. The members of the group are called koledari. The koleda is carried out from the Feast of Saint Ignatius Theophorus (five days before Christmas) up until the Epiphany.Vukoviƒá, pp. 145-146 *Vertep * Easter The archaic term for Easter is Velikden (Great Day) while Vaskrs/Uskrs is officially in use. In these times people greet each other with the terms \\"Hristos vaskrse\\" (Christ is risen) and the reply \\"Vaistinu vaskrse\\" (Indeed, He is risen). *Egg tapping *Egg decoration (Pisanke) Lazarus Saturday Vrbica (–í—Ä–±–∏—Ü–∞) or Lazarus Saturday (–õ–∞–∑–∞—Ä–µ–≤–∞ —Å—É–±–æ—Ç–∞ / Lazareva subota) is a Serbian Orthodox tradition that has origins in the Eastern Christian feast of Lazarus Saturday, however the feast has its own features. The feast celebrates the resurrection of Lazarus of Bethany, the narrative of which is found in the New Testament Gospel of John (). The feast is also to commemorate Tsar Lazar, a national symbol and the King of Serbia who fought and died at the historical Battle of Kosovo in 1389 against the invading Ottoman Turkey. It is believed that Lazar led the procession and since the ritual (Lazarice) is held every year at his name day. *Burning a fire against vermin and snakes *Picking flowers and herbs which are put in water to either drink or swim in *Lazarice ritual, a procession, parade of six maids Zapis The cross inscribed in the bark of a zapis (a beech in this case) near the village of Crna Trava, south-east Serbia. A zapis (Cyrillic: –∑–∞–ø–∏—Å, , literally \\"inscription\\") is a tree in Serbia that is sacred for the village within whose bounds it is situated. A cross is inscribed into the bark of each zapis. Most of these trees are large oaks. Prayers are offered to God under the crown of the zapis, where also church services may be held, especially on village festivals observed to supplicate God for protection against destructive weather conditions. In settlements without a church, ceremonies such as weddings and baptisms used to be conducted under the tree. Folk tradition maintains that great misfortune will happen to anyone who dares to fell a zapis. According to Serbian scholar Veselin ƒåajkanoviƒá, the zapis is inherited from the pre-Christian religion of the Serbs, in which it had been used as a temple.

He is not the actual son of Luchador √Ångel Azteca, but got permission to use the name by the original before he died in 2007, √Ångel Azteca Jr. is the son of Viente Negro. Angel Azteca Jr.'s real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans. √Ångel Azteca Jr. forms a trio called Los √Ångeles Celestiales (\\"The Celestial Angels\\") along with √Ångel de Oro and √Ångel de Plata. √Ångel Azteca Jr. is Spanish for \\"Aztec Angel Jr.\\" Professional wrestling career The wrestler who today is known as √Ångel Azteca Jr. made his professional wrestling debut in 1995, at the age of just 15. Early on he wrestled under the ring name Cobrita Oriental (\\"Little Asian Cobra\\"). Later on he would adopt the ring name Fantastico II, teaming with Fantastico I to form Los Fantasticos. It has not been confirmed that Fantastico I was his brother, but later on the two did team together. In 2005/2006 he adopted the name √Ångel Azteca Jr. and his brother began wrestling as √Ångel Azteca II, both having paid the original √Ångel Azteca for the rights to use the name. The original √Ångel Azteca even returned to the ring to help jumpstart the careers of √Ångel Azteca Jr. and √Ångel Azteca II. The original √Ångel Azteca died in early 2007, after which √Ångel Azteca II changed his ring name to Imperio Azteca while √Ångel Azteca Jr. kept his name as an homage to his mentor. Since the death of √Ångel Azteca promoters have been very careful not to bill √Ångel Azteca Jr. as the actual son of the original and more of his successor. By mid-2007 √Ångel Azteca Jr. wrestled full-time for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre as a low-card Tecnico (fan favorite). On October 2, 2007 he participated in the 2007 Reyes del Aire (\\"Kings of the Air\\") Torneo cibernetico but lost to eventual winner Virus. In June 2008 √Ångel Azteca Jr. teamed up with Mascara Purpura to participate in a tournament for the vacant CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship. The makeshift team defeated Los Romanos (Caligula and Messala) in the first round and Los Guerreros Tuareg (Arkangel de la Muerte and Hooligan) in the second round. In the third round the team lost to Los Infernales (Nosteratu and Euforia). On June 27, 2008 √Ångel Azteca Jr. competed for the Trofeo Generacion del 75 (Generation of 75 Trophy), a tournament for young wrestlers who had joined CMLL during their 75th year of operation. El Hijo del Fantasma won the match but √Ångel Azteca Jr. was able to make a good showing for himself. On July 18, 2008 √Ångel Azteca Jr. took part in CMLL's annual Gran Alternativa tournament, a tournament where an experienced wrestler teams up with a newcomer. √Ångel Azteca Jr. teamed up with Shocker but lost in the first round to tournament winners √öltimo Guerrero and Drag√≥n Rojo Jr.. By the end of 2008 √Ångel Azteca Jr. had begun to team with the brother duo of √Ångel de Plata and √Ångel de Oro to form a low-card trio called Los √Ångeles Celestiales (\\"The Celestial Angels\\"). On April 7, 2009 √Ångel Azteca Jr. participated in a 10-man Torneo cibernetico elimination match for the vacant CMLL World Super Lightweight Championship. The other participants included Rey Cometa, Pegasso, Tiger Kid, P√≥lvora, Inquisidor, S√∫per Comando, Angel de Oro, √Ångel de Plata and eventual winner Mascara Dorada. In late 2009 Los √Ångeles Celestiales participated in a tournament to crown new Mexican National Trios Champion. The team lost in the first round to Los Cancerberos del Infierno Virus, P√≥lvora and Euforia. Talks of a serious feud against Arkangel de la Muerte arose in early 2010, playing off the fact that Arkangel de la Muerte was the wrestler that unmasked the original √Ångel Azteca and that Junior wanted revenge for that deed. No Lucha de Apuesta, mask vs. mask match, has been announced yet as the storyline between the two is in its very early stages. √Ångel Azteca Jr. was one of 12 men who put their mask on the line as part of a 12-man steel cage match in the main event of the 2010 Infierno en el Ring. He worked together with his fellow √Ångeles Celestiales throughout the match and managed to escape as the sixth man out of the cage. In the end, √Ångel de Oro defeated Fabi√°n el Gitano in the Lucha de Apueta portion of the match to unmask him.

Wiseman of 104 West 42nd Street; the rector during construction was listed as Rev. Joseph L. Shestokas of 7 Vandam Street. Wiseman was listed that year as the architect of two venues for Penn Amusements, including a modest brick theatre at 223 West 42nd Street, and an \\"open-air moving picture show\\" on the southeast corner of 111th Street and Eighth Avenue. Description and condition The structure is an attached midblock yellow brick double-height Lombardo-Gothic church with Gothic Revival and Romanesque Revival details designed by Harry G. Wiseman. It was completed in 1910. The only exposed elevation, the Broome Street gable facade is symmetrical divided into an upper and lower section by a moulded limestone platband. The lower facade has a limestone water table/plint moulded with three centrally placed square-headed entrances with raised-and-fielded painted timber five-panel double-leaf doors (top panels glazed), all with pointed-arched limestone typanums above consisting of a moulded lintel and blank typanum with inset moulded terracotta panel (that to center is round, those to sides are almond shaped). Central entrance has detailed limestone gabled surround with single-rebated ornamented pilasters. To right, simple square-headed entrance interrupts plinth with descending steps accessing basement, notice board affixed above. Datestone above plinth to left corner inscribed \\"CHURCH / OF / OUR LADY OF VILNA / MDCCCX\\". Upper facade is divided into three sections with a continuous dentilled cornice rising with the central wide gable section that contains the circular stained-glass rose window with limestone moulded surround, flanked to both sides by the pilaster bases of two narrow towers with round-headed slit window above platband. Towers rise into copper domed upper belfry stages with rebated pointed arch- headed apertures to all sides. Copper-clad crosses surmount both towers and gable apex.J. Russiello, A Sympathetic Planning Hierarchy for Redundant Churches: A Comparison of Continued Use and Reuse in Denmark, England and the United States of America (MSc Conservation of Historic Buildings, University of Bath, 2008), p.350. The church was still standing in February 2011 but the iron clamps holding the limestone plinth had rusted in several sections and burst the masonry. The date stone appeared to have been crudely re-worked with cement applied to certain letters. A statue of an owl was precariously balanced at the base of the rose window, blocking one light. Closure and preservation debate The church was closed on February 27, 2007, one of several that year, by Cardinal Edward Egan of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, citing \\"a damaged roof support beam and a dwindling congregation.\\" The roof had been unstable since the late 1990s and services had been held in the basement. The doors were locked in 2007 and the Archdiocese filed plans to demolish the structure. The church records were moved to nearby St. Anthony of Padua Church at 155 Sullivan Street. Lithuanian president, Valdas Adamkus, petitioned Pope Benedict XVI in person in April 2007 to save the parish. The tabernacle was transferred to the Church of the Blessed Kateri Tekakwitha, which was dedicated in 2008.Parish History of Blessed Kateri Tekakwitha (accessed 4 Jan 2010) \\"On December 23, 2008, the archdiocese‚Äôs demolition company, A.

It was written by Randy Newman and is sung by Keith David, the voice of the film's villain, Doctor Facilier. It depicts Facilier beginning his plan to take over New Orleans by first deceiving Prince Naveen while at the same time, getting his valet, Lawrence, to become his ally. This song is reprised later in the film when he fails and is dragged into the voodoo spirit world. Production The song shares many similarities with Ursula's \\"Poor Unfortunate Souls\\" in The Little Mermaid, both being sung by villains who claim to do business by helping make the dreams of others come true when in reality, they're doing what they do for their own benefit and delight, and both are used as means to deceive the protagonists (both, coincidentally, being royals) into making deals with them, and both songs ending with the protagonist undergoing a mystical transformation that will last for nearly most of the film.''' \\"Friends on the Other Side\\" is the first song in almost a decade after \\"Hellfire\\" from The Hunchback of Notre Dame in 1996, and the deleted song \\"Snuff Out the Light\\" from The Emperor's New Groove in 2000, to continue the tradition of Disney villains of newer Disney films having their own songs. Synopsis Dr. Facilier is envious at just how much wealth is owned by Eli \\"Big Daddy\\" La Bouff. He decides there must be a way to make himself just as wealthy as Eli. Facilier follows Big Daddy and his daughter, Charlotte La Bouff, into a cafe, where they discuss the arrival of a foreign prince, Prince Naveen. A lovesick Charlotte looks to marry Naveen and shares her excitement with a waitress named Tiana. While lurking in the shadows, Facilier eavesdrops on the conversation and plots to use Charlotte and Naveen's union to seize the La Bouff fortune. He leads Naveen and Lawrence into his shop and bids them sit down at a table for a Tarot reading. While performing tricks with his Tarot cards, Facilier reads Naveen and Lawrence's situations: Naveen has been cut off from his parents' money and needs to marry a rich young lady, while Lawrence has apparently been \\"pushed around all [his] life\\", primarily by his family. However, at the end of each reading, Facilier prognosticates that their situation will change, using deliberately ambiguous wording: Naveen will receive \\"green\\" (a double entendre referring to money and to Naveen's later transformation into a frog), while Lawrence will become \\"exactly the man [he] always wanted to be\\", referencing Lawrence's envy of Naveen's carefree life. Facilier pleads for both of them to shake his hand, and grins evilly as they do, sealing a contract with him and summoning his \\"Friends on the Other Side\\", who take the form of voodoo dolls, masks, and shrunken heads. Retrieving a talisman from the largest mask Friend, Facilier uses it to prick Naveen's finger and take his blood, starting his transformation into a frog. Lawrence is terrified as his master shrinks down into the shape of an amphibian, as Facilier exults with dancing and fireworks, before the camera fades to black with a warning of \\"Hush...\\" from the magician. Reprise Tiana tries to destroy the talisman Facilier received in the original to lock away Naveen's blood, but Facilier's shadow grabs it and hands it back to the doctor. A sadistic Facilier then transforms Tiana back into a frog, before taunting her by declaring that she will now spend the rest of her life as a frog. Tiana regains the talisman by grabbing hold of it with her elastic, frog tongue, and destroys it before Facilier can stop her. Upon doing so, Facilier falls into a state of immediate panic and frantically tries to recollect the pieces of the broken talisman, just as his \\"friends from the other side\\" arrive, announcing their intentions to collect the doctor's soul as punishment for his failure to repay his debt. A horrified Facilier tries to persuade his former accomplices to provide him with another opportunity to redeem himself since he still had Naveen captured and needed more time. Despite telling the truth, they are not persuaded as he makes an attempt to escape, but the spirits grab hold of his shadow, thus capturing Facilier as well, subsequently dragging him into the voodoo spirit world, where his soul will be doomed to remain for all eternity. With a flash of light, both Dr. Facilier and the spirits vanish, leaving behind only a tombstone with Facilier's name and horrified face engraved onto it, confirming the witch doctor's death. Critical reception The Telegraph describes it as a \\"trippy voodoo number\\". Commonsensemedia says the song \\"takes listeners through the squares and bayous of the city, bringing to life the mystery of voodoo and magic\\". Slate wrote \\"[Facilier's] big number, Friends on the Other Side, is the best-written in the movie and a great showcase of spooky, voodoo- inflected animation; his comeuppance is appropriately spectacular.\\" High-Def Digest wrote \\"Pixar stalwart Randy Newman... adds warmth and a wonderful sense of genuine Americana to the proceedings... In particular Dr. Facilier's song, 'Friends on the Other Side', is a showstopper. It's a big, broad, scary song and it is an absolute hoot\\". The review said \\"I would include [it] in any 'Blu-ray highlight reel', because it just sounds so amazing. Sequences like that, which are so wholly immersive, with the dialogue so crystal clear and the surround atmospherics at peak precision, are the sequences that will sway anyone towards the glories of the high definition format.\\" Variety said the song was \\"sinister\\", and said it \\"recalls Scar's \\"Be Prepared\\" from The Lion King. FilmTracks said the song \\"steals the show, Keith David's performance a standout\\". It also notes \\"The melodies of the songs do carry over throughout the score, of which more than half an hour exists on Disney's album for the soundtrack. The themes of \\"Almost There,\\" \\"Friends on the Other Side,\\" and \\"Ma Belle Evangeline\\" carry most of the load\\". Yahoo.com described it as \\"devious\\" and one of the film's highlights, saying it is \\"delightfully trippy with its visuals\\". FilmMusicMag wrote \\"if there's a devilish pleasure to The Princess and the Frogs songs, it's the Keith David-topped \\"Friends on the Other Side\\". This show-stealing, slick voodoo man ascends to classic Disney villainhood with \\"Friends on the Other Side\\", his soul-stealing enticement backed by a playfully sinister chorus, funeral brass and stop-and-start melodies that play the character like some twisted version of \\"Sportin' Life\\" in Porgy and Bess. It's a tune that's a devilishly fun match for Danny Elfman's \\"Oogie Boogie's Song\\" in The Nightmare Before Christmas, let alone when Alan Menken had Ursula belt out \\"Poor Unfortunate Souls\\" for The Little Mermaid\\".

The program was canceled in 2013 but resurrected in 2014 as part of phase one of the Amphibious Combat Vehicle. Role The United States Marine Corps is preparing to acquire a new fleet of wheeled armored vehicles to meet the attributes and metrics of the Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC) requirement. The MPC will serve as a medium weight personnel carrier and complements the capabilities offered by the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV ‚Äì light weight personnel carrier category) and the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV ‚Äì heavy weight personnel carrier category). This triad of capabilities EFV ‚Äì MPC ‚Äì JLTV comprises the USMC ground mobility portfolio and the means by which expeditionary, scalable, and networked armored protected seats will be provided to the Marine Air-Ground Task Force in the future. The Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC) will serve as a medium lift personnel carrier and complements the capabilities offered by the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) for light lift purposes and the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) for heavy lift purposes. The MPC will provide landward lift to infantry battalions. One infantry battalion can be lifted by one MPC company along with the infantry battalion's organic wheeled assets. Two MPC-Personnel Carriers can lift a reinforced Infantry squad. An Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) has already been approved and the Capability Development Document (CDD) is in development. The MPC is a new capability that will be a multi-wheeled, armored personnel carrier designed to operate across the range of military operations but focused on an irregular warfare operating environment characterized by operations in constrained and urban terrain. Required to carry 8-9 combat loaded Marines and 2-man crew, the MPC will enable high-speed land maneuver as well as substantial ballistic protection to embarked Marines. Design The MPC will possess a balance between the performance, protection and payload attributes and shall be designed to accomplish a broad array of missions across the range of military operations in a variety of operating environments in which expeditionary operations take place. Variants The MPC family of vehicles will consist of a basic vehicle and two role-specific variants. ;MPC- Personnel The MPC-Personnel will be the basic vehicle, two of which carry and support a reinforced rifle squad of 17 marines. Each vehicle would carry 8‚Äì9 combat-equipped marines and a two-man crew. This meets the need to transport more marine infantrymen than the existing Light Armored Vehicle (LAV) or Humvee platforms while providing greater protection. ;MPC-Command The MPC- Command will be equipped to serve as a mobile command-echelon/ fire-support coordination center for the infantry battalion headquarters. ;MPC-Recovery The MPC-Recovery will be the maintenance and recovery variant of the MPC. Development Rear hatch, with V-hull highlighted in green The Marine Corps deferred Milestone A (MS A) for the Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC) program by two years to FY10. The two-year investment period allowed for the maturation of Government Furnished Equipment and armoring technologies the Marine Corps plans to integrate onto the vehicles once produced. In addition, an MPC Technology Demonstrator vehicle effort will be initiated to inform CDD development on achievable capabilities and integration risks at the Nevada Automotive Test Center. This is the location that hosted the Combat Tactical Vehicle (CTV) test bed for the JLTV program. The MPC-Technology Demonstrator (MPC-TD) vehicle will address all major functional areas and specifically the following: *Mobility (Powerpack, drivetrain, suspension system) *Survivability (Weight affects mobility) *Electrical power generation, management and distribution *C4ISR *Vehicle Health Monitoring The initial Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) included \\"legacy\\" Stryker and the MPC AOA identified a medium armored personnel carrier as the solution to the MPC requirement. The MPC Program Office is pursuing jointness with the Army and including Stryker MOD in the revised MPC AoA. It is scheduled to begin Engineering, Manufacturing and Development in 2012, with initial operational capability in 2018. The acquisition objective is approximately 630 vehicles.

Winners each received $3.5 million contracts for a demonstration and study vehicle for water performance evaluation, survivability testing, and an analysis of human factors and stowage capacity starting in fall 2012.Personnel carrier development contracts awarded - Militarytimes.com, September 10, 2012 TestingAmphibious tests= On 3 April 2013, the Lockheed Havoc successfully completed amphibious testing as part of its evaluation for the MPC program. Trials were conducted at Camp Pendleton with the vehicle loaded to its full combat weight. The Havoc demonstrated its resistance to water penetration and ability to negotiate all surf and wave conditions while accommodating a full complement of Marine Corps battle gear for the crew. It maintained 100 percent operational readiness throughout the test.Lockheed Martin's Havoc 8x8 Completes Swim Tests - Lockheed press release, April 3, 2013 On 8 May 2013, BAE and Iveco successfully completed 12 days of evaluations on the Superav for the MPC program at Camp Pendleton. The evaluations included a water performance demonstrations in various sea conditions, as well as human factors and stowage capacity. The Superav exceeded all vehicle requirements, performing personnel exit drills in less than 17 seconds and showcasing advanced interior layout and compartmentalization that allowed for the stowage of more than three days of supplies without jeopardizing the survivability of the vehicle and personnel. Similar tests conducted by Iveco confirmed the vehicle's ability to be launched and recovered from ships and transition in surf zones. BAE and Iveco then prepared for survivability demonstrations in the summer.US Marine Corps Successfully Test Iveco SuperAV 8x8 Marine Personnel Carrier - Deagel.com, May 8, 2013 On 6 June 2013, General Dynamics successfully completed water performance swim and human factors testing at Camp Pendleton. The General Dynamics MPC entry is based on their LAV III APC with a Double V-hull, making it the first vehicle with the hull design to have swim capabilities. The General Dynamics MPC demonstrated swim capabilities at its fully armored combat weight, along with the required ability to carry 12 Marines and their equipment. Rapid tactical and emergency egress through the vehicle‚Äôs large roof hatches and rear ramp was also demonstrated. The vehicle was buoyant at its full combat weight, which included two days of supplies to support 12 marines. It also maneuvered safely through varying sea levels up to four feet deep and reached water speeds of over six knots.General Dynamics Marine Personnel Carrier Completes Critical Marine Corps Swim and Human Factors Testing - General Dynamics press release, 6 June 2013 On 18 July 2013, SAIC, along with ST Kinetics and Armatec Survivability Corporation, successfully completed two weeks of evaluations for the Terrex at Camp Pendleton. The tests included a series of water performance demonstrations in various sea conditions and an evaluation of human factors and stowage capacity. The Terrex completed all required surf transit and ocean swim maneuverability tests at its fully loaded combat weight. It demonstrated load capabilities through successful stowage of gear and supplies that Marines would require for three days of operations, with space available for additional equipment. The human factors evaluation demonstrated the spacious interior by accommodating the specified number of combat-equipped Marines and enabling rapid tactical and emergency egress through a quick-release hatch. The Terrex repeated ocean swim and maneuverability results achieved in a March 2013 rehearsal event. SAIC began ballistic and blast tests at the Nevada Automotive Test Center in May 2013, and was scheduled to complete all ballistic and mine blast demonstrations in July.

The vehicle completed all threshold and objective protection system testing, with instrumentation indicating that no disabling injuries would have resulted to any of the three crew members and nine dismounted Marines. Lockheed also delivered a report demonstrating the high degree of commonality between the Havoc and other Marine Corps vehicles, aimed at reducing cost, training requirements, and logistics needs.Havoc 8x8 Demonstrates High Levels of Crew Protection in Marine Corps' Blast Testing - Deagel.com, 24 September 2013 Deferment In June 2013, days after General Dynamics completed water performance swim and human factors testing, the Marine Corps officially put the MPC program on hold. The program was delayed by budget cuts and prioritization of the Amphibious Combat Vehicle by the Marines. Although the MPC's primary role is to carry troops once ashore, it is amphibious like the ACV, and Congress has expressed concerns about funding two vehicle programs to fulfill the role. Marine officials promised to maintain contact with interested vehicle manufacturers so that if the decision was made to restart the MPC program, it could be done in an expeditious and cost- efficient manner. Procurement of the planned 579 MPC vehicles was on \\"indefinite hold,\\" and it could have been 10 years before development was restarted. It would have taken several years for the vehicle to be designed, built, and fielded. Given technological advancements as well as emerging threat weapons systems and the constantly changing geo-strategic environment, the MPC developmental requirements may not have been valid or relevant over the next five to ten years.Commitment to Swimming Vehicle Throws Off Marines‚Äô Tight Modernization Schedule - Nationaldefensemagazine.org, October 2013 ACV Increment 1.1 Shortly after the Marine Corps submitted their FY 2015 budget request in February 2014, General Jim Amos decided to postpone development of the Amphibious Combat Vehicle program and return funding to the Marine Personnel Carrier. Originally, the Marines planned to buy both the ACV and MPC to replace outdated vehicles to complement each other for different missions. During an amphibious assault, a limited number of ACVs would carry the initial landing force from ship to shore and further inland. After the beach was secured, a larger number of MPCs would be landed by landing craft to reinforce the first wave. When budgets tightened, the ACV was taken as the priority and funding was removed from the MPC, with the service figuring they could buy an off-the-shelf wheeled troop transport later when money was available. Technical challenges to the proposed ACV continued to mount as funds kept getting constrained, so the decision was made that wheeled APC advancements were significant enough to address needs quicker. Marines still want a high-speed fully amphibious vehicle to move troops from the ocean to a beach with enough armor, mobility, and firepower to fight while on land, so a phased approach was decided for the ACV. Phase 1 would be the procurement of an interim vehicle to replace the aging Amphibious Assault Vehicle, while Phase 2 would develop desired capabilities for the platform. There was some suggestion of incorporating the MPC into ACV Phase 1, and combining it with a high-speed watercraft that can bring it to the landing area, or close enough that it can use its own limited amphibious capabilities. If the MPC had funding restored in 2015, time spent on holding a competition and evaluations would lead to operational quantities being available around 2020.Marines Budget Scramble: Commandant Resurrects MPC, ACV In Limbo - Breakingdefense.com, 17 February 2014 ACV Phase I is a restructured version of the MPC, which will be the procurement of a modified U.S. or foreign wheeled armored troop transport. 200 basic transports will be bought as part of ACV 1.1, following which ACV 1.2 will buy an additional 400 vehicles in other variants including command and fire support. Phase I ACV submissions are likely to include the previous contenders for the MPC program. The vehicle will need a higher swim capability standard than the MPC, with the ability to move to shore from water after being dropped off by a connector. It will travel that distance in one hour, roughly the same time and distance the AAV deploys and travels at.

It is named for the local 19th-century politician Morgan Lewis Martin. Housing development started in the 1920s around two breweries. The area has benefited from local improvement programs and community activities since the 1990s. Geography The Martin Drive neighborhood is located on Milwaukee's west side. The neighborhood is located north and west of Miller Brewing Company. It includes Harley-Davidson and the Highland Avenue Viaduct. The neighborhood was built up in the 1920s and is home to several old apartment buildings. The neighborhood has retained its density and is still one of the safest neighborhoods in the city.Crime Statistics for the city of Milwaukee Martin Drive is bordered by Martin Drive in the south, 35th Street in the east, Vliet Street in the north, and US 41 in the west. Milwaukee's Washington Park is located just north of the neighborhood. History=Naming Morgan Lewis Martin Morgan Martin, a Green Bay Lawyer and speculator, bought half of Solomon Juneau's Juneautown property for $500 in 1833. In 1835 they co-founded their new village, with Martin responsible for the legal and promotional aspects while Juneau took care of local issues. Martin, born in Martinsburg, New York in 1805 (his father founded the town), was a Wisconsin congressman, assemblyman, and state senator, as well as Oneida Indian Agent in Green Bay. He died in 1887. A street in the village was named for Martin, but during the 1920s renaming program it was changed to State Street. To appease those who complained that Martin deserved a place on the city's map, this street, one block south of Juneau Avenue, was renamed Martin Drive in 1926.Baehr, Carl. Milwaukee Streets: The Stories Behind their Names. Development The building era for Martin Drive began in about the late 1910s. Original plats of the area allowed commercial building on what is now State Street, with two breweries - the Gettleman brewery and Plank Road Brewery - located in the area adjacent to the Martin Drive Neighborhood. Much of the early development begins with platting of Highland Avenue. Advertisement for homes in area, circa 1920 1901 Map of Martin Drive Neighborhood. Schiller Street is now the 1200-1300 Block of North 43rd Street. Address numbers were different back then. A neighbor looked up an address of a house built in 1905. Back then the address was 398 Schiller ST. Today the house is 1260 North 43 ST. Advertisement for homes in area, circa 1920 1923 Map of the Martin Drive Neighborhood Advertisement for homes in area, circa 1920 1937 Map of the Martin Drive Neighborhood, all present day streets are visible. Area is before Highway 41 was built, causing the moving of homes and the demolition of 47th Street in the neighborhood. 1956 Map of the Martin Drive Neighborhood: Highway 41 is built with an on/off ramp on street named \\"Martin Drive\\". Forty-seventh street in the neighborhood is demolished and houses moved/destroyed. During the 1920s to 1950s, city boundaries at the time ended at 27th Street. The Town of Wauwatosa ran from what is now 27th Street to 124th Street. Ads began to run in the daily papers or on posted bills. An example of three ads from the period marketing property around Washington Park are pictured. The plotting of lots were completed and many houses were constructed during the period of 1920-1929. The Sanborn fire maps were created and fire insurance risks were calculated for this region. Most homes were of frame construction. The subdivision developments of the Martin Drive Neighborhood were the Park Front, Highland, Schmoldts, and Menomonee plats. Park Front: This development includes land north of Juneau on 46th Street in the 1200 to 1300 blocks, as well as on 45th Street from the 1100 block to Vliet Street. The homes in this development were primarily frame and were a mix of duplex and single family construction. Few brick homes were found in this development. Highland Heights: The homes and lots south of Juneau on 46th, 45th, 44th and 43rd Streets are in the Highland Heights subdivision plat, including 46th Street to State Street. Many of the homes on 46th and 45th Streets in this development were duplexes of frame construction. Schmoldt's: The 1200 and 1300 block of 43rd Street are in the Schmoldt's development plat. This includes some of the Vliet Street properties adjoining these streets. Menomonee: The 1300 block on 42nd Street, including the west side of Highland Boulevard are part of the Menomonee subdivision. Many of the units on Highland Ave are larger Victorian style brick faced homes. There are also multi-unit buildings of concrete and brick. RejuvenationThe 1990s= In the 1990s, neighborhood improvements and neighborhood housing services started the formation of an organized block club in the surrounding neighborhoods. Revitalization efforts and corporate neighbors raised concerns and began to improve housing stock in the area. Cleanup efforts gained support with some use of block grant funding for paint and fix-up programs. Such cleanups improved the appeal of the neighborhood and new owners were drawn to dwellings in the Martin Drive neighborhood. Yearly traditions developed. The value of a home compared to the money spent for it became a big benefit to new home buyers at this time. The new owners discovered the convenient location saved them time and helped to improve their quality of life. Other efforts by neighboring groups such as Vliet Street Business Association,Vliet Street Business Association Habitat for Humanity International, the Marquette Interchange improvements, Healthy Neighborhoods Initiative, and the efforts by nearby Miller Brewing Company and Harley-Davidson had positive economic effects on Martin Drive and other west side neighborhoods. =Present day= In the 21st century, improvements and updates continue as the city and neighborhood group focus on quality of life concerns. Many of the housing units have installed new windows, replaced siding, improved landscaping and fencing, added driveways, and replaced roofs. In addition, the neighborhood is seeing a growth in business on Vliet Street. Property values continue to rise because of the high quality housing stock. The neighborhood seems to have stabilized and owner occupancy continues to be a bonus for this area. Neighbors still see benefits in the annual neighborhood cleanups and many families participate in the Halloween trick or treat, neighborhood-wide rummage sale, summer picnic, holiday caroling and other neighborhood activities. In 2008, a Sunday farmer's market developed across the street from the neighborhood at the Washington Park Senior Center.[Interview: Mueller, Pat \\"Vliet Street Community Green Market\\" In 2009, a community garden developed at 46th and Vliet Street with a green space neighbors use for summer picnics. Three planters identify the neighborhood. In 2010, stone markers and new plantings mark boundaries for the neighborhood. In 2011, outdoor evening movies started at a community garden. In 2012, Little Free Libraries were first installed in the neighborhood. Neighbors are more active and have more dialog within the community, primarily at the monthly neighborhood meetings, but also are using the Internet and e-mail to facilitate these neighborhood communications.[Interview: Johnson, Dave \\"History of Martin Drive Neighborhood\\" After several decades of stagnant growth the neighborhood is now seeing redevelopment with a few new businesses and building renovations. As such, the neighborhood supports many small and upstart businesses such as Eat Cake, and the nearby Vliet Street Business Association. Martin Drive has several private and public schools nearby. Grocery stores, hardware stores and pharmacies are in close proximity to the Martin Drive Neighborhood. The neighborhood has a strong and dedicated volunteer-led neighborhood association, the Martin Drive Neighborhood Association.Martin Drive Neighborhood Association In 2014, neighbors formed a non-profit, called Martin Drive Neighborhood, Inc.

Uses  Its primary usage is primarily to neutralize peptide terminal amino groups in scientific research.Trinitrobenzenesulfonic Acid, Comparative Toxicogenomics Database. Occasionally it is used as a detonator for certain other explosive compounds. It is also used to induce Crohn's disease in the colon of laboratory animals in order to model inflammatory bowel disease.  Health concerns and safety precautions  The primary hazard of working with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid is the risk of instantaneous explosion. 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid is an extremely sensitive compound especially when mixed with other compounds, exposed to heat, or exposed to rapid temperature or pressure changes. The toxicological properties of this compound have not been investigated, so all health effects are unknown. To best prevent bodily harm or injury it is recommended that all direct contact be avoided and the compound be kept under extremely strict environmentally controlled conditions. In case of spillage it is recommended that a local fire department be called in advance prior to any attempt at cleaning.

Andersen has also worked for Pro Wrestling Revolution in California, Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) in Mexico and Japanese promotions Inoki Genome Federation (IGF) and New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW). Professional wrestling career=Early career Andersen trained for his professional wrestling career in the All Pro Wrestling (APW) Bootcamp, making his debut in 2003. From 2003 until 2007 he wrestled only part-time to focus on his bodybuilding and strongman career and primarily for APW. By 2008 he began making regular appearances for California-based Pro Wrestling Revolution (PWR) promotion as a \\"Special feature\\" due to his enormous size. He also worked tours of Japan, wrestling for Antonio Inoki's Inoki Genome Federation (IGF) in both 2008 and 2009. He received further training between 2008 and 2009 in Pro Wrestling Revolution by Vaquero Fantasma to prepare him for his work in Mexico. Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (2009‚Äì2011) In September, 2009 Andersen signed a contract to wrestle for the Mexico City, Mexico based Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) promotion and made his debut for the company on October 5, 2009 using the name \\"Jon Strongman\\". The storyline used to introduce Jon Strongman to CMLL was that Shocker found him while on tour with Pro Wrestling Revolution as the first member of his faction Los Guapos (\\"The good looking ones\\"). In his debut Strongman teamed with Shocker and H√©ctor Garza to defeat El Terrible, El Texano, Jr. and Ray Mendoza, Jr.. In the months after his debut Strongman began a storyline feud with √öltimo Guerrero, holder of the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship. The storyline heated up after √öltimo Guerrera was accidentally knocked unconscious during a match with Jon Strongman and CMLL decided to write it into the storyline between the two. Strongman appeared at CMLL's Sin Salida event on December 4, 2009 teaming with M√≠stico and H√©ctor Garza to defeat Guerrero, Atlantis and Mr. Niebla, his first appearance at a major CMLL event.

Background The founder of Blue Ridge Capital, John Griffin, is believed to have been a \\"right-hand man\\" to the billionaire money manager Julian Robertson. Blue Ridge Capital generally targets \\"absolute returns\\" by investing in and short-selling companies, with a focus on \\"going long\\" (i.e. buying the stock of companies rather than selling it short.) Blue Ridge's investment thesis is based on fundamental analysis, and focuses on companies that have competitive advantages in their industries, while shorting those thought to have \\"fundamental problems.\\" The principal, Griffin, is highly compensated and after a 65% return on the fund in 2007 he reportedly made $625 million. Investment process Blue Ridge has a lengthy process for vetting both long and short investments. Generally, they are focused on individual companies rather than a sector; a \\"checklist methodology\\" is used to identify good performers in a given category. Industry outlook is also taken into account in the investment process. Key factors in the consideration of industry-relevant matters are the power of stakeholders, barriers to market entries, ingredients of success, and business development opportunities. Analysts at Blue Ridge also need to address the business model, the management, the financial structure, and the risks of the company they're considering; a detailed time line is also created, which attempts to pin down catalysts for a changed valuation in the share price.Hedge Fund Newsletters, \\"Blue Ridge Capital A prospective investment must also be evaluated for the presence of questionable accounting practices.. Joint ventures In 2008, Blue Ridge Capital's division in China started a joint venture with Equity International investing in Xinyuan Real Estate.

She sued the school system and banned schools and was the hero. Family Rosita was the daughter of Luis de la Vega and Consuelo Tesoro. In 1948, she married Alberto Barretto da Roza, a dignified-looking Spanish-Portuguese mestizo. Together they have eight children: Enrique, Cynthia, Jose Alberto, Manuel Luis, Maria Luisa, Lourdes Rosario, Francisco Antonio and Ana Consuelo. At present, she has 33 grandchildren and 14 great grand children. Career Her first experience in singing in front of a big crowd was during her elementary graduation where she sang O Sole Mio which was taught to her by her father. She attended Arellano High School under American teachers when her father was transferred to Manila. During the Japanese occupation in the Philippines, Rosita got her first break with the help of Lou Salvador Sr. who hired her to sing the intermission numbers from the Cine Strand. It was also Lou who gave Rosita her name, from Rosario. Then she transferred to the production of Joe Generoso at the Life Theater. Here she performed with Kathy dela Cruz, Rogelio dela Rosa, Sylvia La Torre, Dolphy and Chiquito. After the war, she made rounds of camps to entertain the wounded American soldiers along with other singers that were invited by the United States Service Organization. Then, she joined the post- war night club, starting with El Cairo Nightclub in Sta. Mesa. Here she was accompanied by the orchestra of Mike Velarde, and where she met her husband Alberto da Roza. She also joined the Metro Garden and Grill, also in Sta. Mesa, where she was accompanied by the orchestra of Ben Aristorenas. Also at the Rivera Night Club where she sang before the high society crowd with the Joe Contreras Orchestra. In 1950 to 1953, Rosita already recorded no less than 48 songs under eight recording studios. Her songs made her popular and at the same time controversial. She was chosen by Raul Manglapus to sing the campaign song of Ramon Magsaysay, claiming that her voice could swing the vote for the candicate, which was known as the man of the masses. Rosita sang her version of the song Mambo Masaysay. Rafael Yabut, who banned her song \\"I Like It\\" in his radio program, in time, made amends in his critical attitude towards the beautiful singer and invited her to be one of the regular live singers for his Sunday morning program Tayoy'y Mag-aliw, which ran from 1969 to 1975. Later years and death Thereafter she chose to devote herself to her family. This time, her focus was on the Catholic Church where she became a lay leader, volunteer an avid cursilista and a member of the charismatic group of Sta. Ana. In 2006, Tribung Pilipino Foundation honored Rosita with an afternoon tribute. The concert was held at the South Seas of Pearl Manila Hotel. In early 2008, she suffered a massive brain hemorrhage. She died on April 7, 2008. Rosita was 83 years old. Signature songs Some of her famous songs were adaptations of American songs and also, Levi Celerio, who is now a National Artist, penned most of the local versions of the lyrics. * Sa Liwanag ng Buwan (1954) (By the Light of the Silvery Moon) * Kung Ikaw ay Akin (1958) (Oh My Wonderful One) * Mambo Magsaysay (1953) - the official song for the candidacy of Ramon Magsaysay * My Love (Since You Went Away) She also sang: * Atomic Boogie (1952) * Ayoko ng nga (1953) * Basagulera (1954) * Be Mine Tonight (1952) * Buhay ko (1956) * Cadillac-kad (1955) * Dahan-Dahan (1953) * Double Crosser (1954) * I Like It (1949) * Kung Lumimot ka man (1955) * Luneta (song) (1954) * Maladja Pala Pascalata (1952) * Nakasasabik (1957) * Night in Manila (1952) * No Money No Honey (1954) * Rose, Do You Have Bananas?

Chromatin, a substance that contains genetic material such as DNA, is normally found in a loose bundle inside a cell's nucleus. During the prophase of mitosis, the chromatin in a cell compacts to form condensed chromosomes; this condensation is required in order for the cell to divide properly. While mitotic cells have condensed chromosomes, interphase cells do not. PCC results when an interphase cell fuses with a mitotic cell, causing the interphase cell to produce condensed chromosomes prematurely. The appearance of a prematurely condensed chromosome depends on the stage that the interphase cell was in. Chromosomes that are condensed during the G1 phase are usually long and have a single strand, while chromosomes condensed during the S phase appear crushed. Condensation during the G2 phase yields long chromosomes with two chromatids. PCC was first reported in 1968, of viral-infected cells showing strange appearance of chromosomes. It was found that the strange appearance was selectively observed in S-phase nuclei, and therefore concluded that the nuclei of cells fused in mitotic cells condensed prematurely by unknown material which accumulated in mitotic cells, and observed chromosome structures that are equivalent to those in cell fusion. This material was named as the mitosis promoting factor (MPF). The precise mechanism of chromosome condensation, as well as the premature condensation, is still in question. It is only known that MPF is a key enzyme that induces PCC in somatic cells or oocytes, as they play a key role in cell cycle regulation and cell growth control. When the interphase nuclei is exposed to activated MPF, which is supplied from the mitotic nuclei, PCC is induced.

Raziel's real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans. He previously worked as Caligula for many years, forming the team Los Romanos along with Messala (who is now known as Cancerbero). The name \\"Raziel\\" is taken from the Archangel Raziel in Jewish mysticism and is sometimes also written as \\"Raciel\\". Professional wrestling career The wrestler who is currently known as Raziel trained under Skayde and Jos√© Aar√≥n Alvarado Nieves, better known as Brazo Cibernetico and was considered one of their top pupils at the time. Upon his debut in 1996 he adopted the ring persona \\"Neo\\", teaming up with a fellow Skayde/Alvarado graduate who wrestled as \\"Geo\\", both enmascarados (masked wrestlers) who wrestled a high-flying style. Early in their careers the duo worked for Asistencia Asesor√≠a y Administraci√≥n (AAA), and were part of a group called Los Cadetos del Espacio (\\"The Space Cadets\\") for a brief period of time. After their stint in AAA they worked for the short lived Promo Azteca promotion as well as International Wrestling Revolution Group before changing their ring characters. Los Romanos In 2005 he began working for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) and was teamed up with another recent CMLL signee. CMLL gave Neo a new identity as Caligula, named after the Roman Emperor Caligula, the ring persona was that of a Roman soldier complete with a mask designed to look like a Roman soldier's helmet. His teammate was named Messala and given a similar Roman inspired gimmick and collectively they became known as Los Romanos (\\"The Romans\\"). The team worked as low ranked Rudos (bad guys) who mainly worked with young wrestlers to give them in-ring experience and to assess their talent. On June 15, 2008, Los Romanos participated in a tournament for the vacant CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship but the experienced team lost to the makeshift team of √Ångel Azteca, Jr. and M√°scara Purpura in the first round. Los Romanos remained firmly placed in the opening or low card position throughout 2008 and into 2009. Los Cancerberos del Infierno On November 18, 2009, CMLL presented a new Rudo group, Los Cancerberos del Infierno (\\"The Infernal Cerberus\\") a team led by veteran mid-carder Virus and consisted of rookies P√≥lvora and Euforia as well as two new characters never used before: Raziel and Cancerberos. It was later revealed that Raziel and Cancerbero were not two new wrestlers, but the repackaged Los Romanos with Caligula changing his name to Raziel and Messala being turned into Cancerbero. In late 2009 Los Cancerberos participated in a tournament to crown new Mexican National Trios Champion, Virus, P√≥lvora, and Euforia represented the group and defeated Los √Ångeles Celestiales (√Ångel Azteca, Jr., √Ångel de Plata and √Ångel de Oro) in the first round. Following the tournament loss Los √Ångeles Celestiales and Los Cancerberos del Infierno have developed a rivalry between the two groups, facing off on various CMLL shows, including their Friday night CMLL Super Viernes show. On the January 15, 2010, Super Viernes Raziel defeated √Ångel de Plata in a Lighting match, continuing the building storyline between the two factions. In May, 2015 Raziel competed in a qualifying match for the 2015 version of En Busca de un √çdolo alongside 15 other wrestlers Raziel competed in a torneo cibernetico, elimination match where the last eight wrestlers would qualify for the tournament. He compete against Akuma, Blue Panther Jr., Cancerbero, Canelo Casas, Delta, Disturbio, Esfinge, Flyer, El Gallo, Guerrero Maya Jr., Joker, Pegasso, Sagrado, Stigma and Boby Zavala. Raziel was the second wrestler eliminated as he was pinned by Guerrero Maya Jr. On December 25, 2015 as part of CMLL's annual Infierno en el Ring show Raziel was one of twelve men risking their mask in the main event steel cage match. He was the tenth man to leave the cage, keeping his mask safe in the process. In January 2017, Raziel made his Japanese debut by taking part in Fantastica Mania 2017, the annual tour co-produced by CMLL and New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW).

They vary in temperature from . History A Latin inscription from Aquae Helveticae Baden is first attested in Roman sources as (\\"Waters of the Helvetii\\"). Hippocrates had counseled against the use of water from mineral springs, but by the time of Vitruvius, Pliny, and Galen they were being selectively employed for certain ailments. In addition to their medical use, the Romans also revered natural springs for recreational and religious use. Tacitus mentions the town obliquely, describing it as \\"a place built up into a semblance of a town... much used for its healthful waters\\". This Roman vicus was to the north of the Baden gorge on the Haselfeld, founded to support the legionary camp at Vindonissa. There was a pool complex on the left bank of the Limmat fed by a system of springs with water. The main axis of the vicus was the Vindonissa road, which ran parallel to the slope. It was flanked by porticos, beyond which lay commercial and residential buildings. The center of the settlement had some wealthy villa-like structures. The resort, residential, and commercial districts all grew to a respectable size over the first half of the 1st century. In 69, however, the 21st Legion burned the town amid the conflicts of the Year of the Four Emperors. Its wooden buildings destroyed, the town was rebuilt in stone. The town shrank some after the closing of the Vinonissa camp in 101 but survived on trade. Reginus's pottery workshop and Gemellianus's bronze works flourished during the second half of the 2nd century. Around the middle of the 3rd century, however, the settlement was threatened by multiple Alemanni invasions and the Huns. The pools were fortified and a large number of coins stamped with references to the hot springs show it continued to be settled and frequented into late antiquity, but expansion of the settlement of Haselfeld came to an end.

December 1874 The baths were frequented again by the time of Charlemagne. A medieval necropolis in Kappelerhof has been dated as far back as the 7th century and a local lord fortifying the Stein by the 10th. The modern name Baden is first attested in 1040. Around that time, its land was held by the Lenzburgs, some of whom styled themselves as the \\"Counts of Baden\\" in the 12th century and erected a castle. Upon their extinction around 1172, their domains were divided among the Hohenstaufens, Z√§hringens, and Kyburgs, with the Kyburgs gaining control of Baden through the marriage of Harmanns III with its heiress Richenza. Around 1230, they founded the medieval city of Baden, holding markets and erecting a bridge across the river in 1242. Upon the death of the childless Hartman IV in 1264, his lands were seized by Rudolf von Habsburg by right of his wife Gertrude's claim. Stein Castle was held by Habsburg bailiffs and maintained the administration and archives for their surrounding territory. The Confederacy besieged and destroyed the castle and its records in 1415 during its conquest of Aargau. Thus, the County of Baden was established. Baden in 1642 Under the Confederation, their bailiff held a castle on the right bank of the Limmat, controlling access to the bridge. The Swiss Diet met at Baden repeatedly from 1426 to about 1712, making Baden a kind of capital for Switzerland. The Town Hall ('), where the Diet met, can still be visited. Over the course of the 15th century, the town regained its popularity as a Spa Resort ('). The town was the site of a famous debate on transubstantiation from May 21 to June 18, 1526. Although Zwingli refused to attend in person, he printed broadsheets throughout its duration and sent his assistant Johannes Oecolampadius to debate Johann Eck and Thomas Murner. In the end, a majority decided against the reformers but a substantial bloc emerged on their behalf as well. Johann Pistorius held a disputation in the city in 1589. Stein was refortified sometime between 1658 and 1670 but the fortress was abandoned in 1712. In 1714, the treaties of Rastatt and Baden ended hostilities between France and the Habsburgs, the last theater of the War of the Spanish Succession. Another Treaty of Baden ended the Toggenburg War among the Protestant and Catholic Swiss cantons in 1718. Baden was the capital of the canton of Baden from 1798 until 1803, when the canton of Aargau was created. In the 19th century, the waters were considered efficacious for gout and rheumatism.

The word combines tele (for \\"television\\") and novela (meaning \\"novel\\"). Similar genres around the world include teleserye (Philippines), t√©l√©roman (Canada, specifically Quebec), or simply dramas (rest of Asia including the Middle East). Commonly described using the American colloquialism Spanish soap opera, many telenovelas share some stylistic and thematic similarities to the soap opera familiar to the English-speaking world. The significant difference is their series run length; telenovelas tell one self-contained story, typically within the span of a year or less whereas soap operas tend to have intertwined storylines told during indefinite, continuing runs.Paula Andal√≥, \\"Love, Tears, Betrayal...and Health Messages,\\" Perspectives in Health Magazine: The Magazine of the Pan American Health Organization. vol. 8, no. 2, 2003 This makes them shorter than most other television series, but still much longer than a miniseries.

Mercifully, unlike their slower-paced American brethren, they also were finite.\\" Episodes of telenovelas usually last between 30 and 45 minutes, and rarely more than an hour, except for final episodes. The telenovela combines drama with the 19th-century feuilleton, and naturally evolved from the Latin American radionovela, according to Blanca de Lizaur. The medium has been used frequently by authorities in various countries to transmit sociocultural messages by incorporating them into storylines. By the 1970s and 1980s, Mexico became a world pioneer in using telenovelas to shape behavior, particularly successful in introducing the idea of family planning.

In 1952 Cuba released Senderos de amor (\\"Paths of Love\\") and Mexico released √Ångeles de la calle (\\"Angels of the Street\\"), shown once a week. Between 1957 and 1958 Mexico produced its first drama serial in the modern telenovela format of Monday to Friday slots, Senda prohibida (\\"Forbidden Path\\"), written by Fernanda Villeli. The first global telenovela was Los ricos tambi√©n lloran (\\"The Rich Also Cry\\", Mexico, 1979), which was exported to Russia, China, the United States and other countries. Genres Telenovelas tend to fall within these seven categories: *Working-class melodrama, which is the most popular to date, easy to understand and contains less explicit content. This is heavily reliant of the common rags-to-riches plot, typically featuring a poor woman who falls in love with a rich man whose family spurns her, such as the Las Tres Marias (\\"Maria Trilogy\\", 1992, 1994 and 1995). *Historical romance is set in the past, such as the colonial period (Mart√≠n Garatuza, 1986), the restoration of the Republic (El carruaje \\"The Carriage\\", 1972), the late 19th Century (El vuelo del √°guila \\"The Flight of The Eagle\\", 1994) the Mexican Revolution (Bodas de odio \\"Weddings of Hate\\", 1982), and the 20th-century military dictatorships (such as Anos Rebeldes \\"Rebellious Years\\", 1992) *Teen drama, which portrays the lives of high school teenagers and their issues with sex, drugs and other coming-of-age topics. This genre started with Quincea√±era in 1987. *Mystery/thriller is a category of telenovela that is more cold-hearted than the other subgenres. It may portray a mysterious death or disappearance, which may tear couples, even families apart, such as Cuna de Lobos (\\"Wolves Crib\\"), La Casa al Final de la Calle (\\"The House at the Street End\\"), La Mujer de Judas (\\"The Woman of Judas\\"), ¬øD√≥nde est√° Elisa? (\\"Where's Elisa?\\"), El Rostro de la Venganza (\\"The Face of Revenge\\") or La Casa de al Lado (\\"The House Next Door\\"). Chile has produced this genre. *Horror is a subgenre of telenovelas that is rarer than the rest, it can deal with anything of the horror genre, but the majority of these telenovelas deal with the themes of the supernatural like demons, witchcraft, ghosts, and the occult, they're one of the only subgenres that uses special effects. It always portrays the main protagonist trying to find out the truth while at the sametime confronting frightening events and the main antagonist which is always a witch or warlock, demon, evil or vengeful ghost, or the devil itself such as El maleficio, El Extra√±o Retorno de Diana Salazar, and La chacala. *Romantic comedy, which portrays love stories with some or much comedy such as Las tontas no van al cielo \\"Fools Don't Go to Heaven\\" or Yo soy Betty, la fea (the most successful telenovela in history).\\"Yo soy Betty la fea‚Äô entra al libro de los Guinnes Records *Pop band story portrays the lives of aspiring popstars such as in Alcanzar una estrella (\\"Reaching a Star\\", 1990) and its sequel Alcanzar una estrella II (1991), as well as Rebelde (2004), which spawned a multi-platinum pop group, RBD. Some, though not all, of these type of telenovelas are geared towards a teenage and/or pre-teen audience. *Narcotraffic Recently narcotrafficer telenovelas have become frequently presented. Besides these, another category of serial that has become popular in recent years is the youth telenovela, which borrow some elements of the teen drama format but are usually more family-oriented in structure, contain comedic elements and sometimes maintain a high concept or supernatural plotline (such as 11:11: En mi cuadra, nada cuadra and Chica vampiro). Telenovelas have geographically diverged into two major groups ‚Äì the Latinovelas, and the Asianovelas, portmanteaus of Latin and Asian with novelas. Telenovelas, in particular, are the most popular non-English-speaking scripted forms of entertainment in the world to date. The Latinovelas, made in Spain, Portugal, and the Americas, are widely popular in Latin America and other Iberian-speaking countries including Brazil, Spain, Portugal, the Philippines, and East Timor, and in Hispanic Spanish-speaking communities in the United States. They also have a huge following in Europe's Mediterranean and eastern borders, as well as in Asia and Oceania. Latinovelas are primarily responsible for the telenovela trend in regions outside of Latin America, which is known as the biggest producer of telenovelas up until the early 2000s. The Asianovelas, made in South Korea, Turkey, the Philippines, and the Middle East, are currently dominating television programming through most of Africa and Eurasia, and have recently made inroads in the Latinovelas-dominated television in the Americas. In the Arab world, telenovelas are very popular with families taking breaks during the day from midday onward to watch these shows, whose content often reflects many of the moral and social issues faced in cultures like Morocco, Algeria and Egypt. The medium has been used repeatedly to transmit sociocultural messages by incorporating them into storylines.  Millennial telenovela  In the 2010s, the terms \\"millennial telenovela\\" and \\"modern telenovela\\" have been coined to describe an emerging genre related to the telenovela. Based in the same culture, the target audience is much younger (the millennials); the typical storylines and melodrama were recreated to better appeal to this demographic. Commenters have written that a millennial telenovela will contain many of the following themes: it fits into contemporary politics and culture; has positive representations of LGBT+ people when present; features themes of female empowerment and the sexualization of the male body; involves use of social media; presents characters of moral ambiguity rather than in black and white, and with more complexity; contains intentionally comedic moments; and is centered on an unconventional family. Though the term \\"millennial telenovela\\" was first used in 2016 when BuzzFeed and Telemundo co-produced a short series to cater for the emerging Latin American millennial market, it became more widely used in 2018 after the success of the Netflix black comedy The House of Flowers. The development of the genre may be a response to a polemic market of importing telenovelas to US channels, with a Univision and Televisa deal having to be renegotiated when traditional telenovelas fell in popularity around 2016; at this point, the majority of Hispanic people in the US were millennials, and \\"drawn to edgier and more fast-paced programs than traditional telenovelas.\\" Though Univision did not start making its own hybrid shows, they began investing in online and multimedia programming, and bought into Netflix's original Mexican programming. ;Series described as millennial telenovelas * Jane the Virgin * Much Ado About Nada * The House of Flowers * Luis Miguel: The Series Major producers of telenovelas Some of the world's major producers of telenovelas include the following: *North America **United States ***Telemundo, Univision *Latin America **Argentina ***Telefe, Artear, Ideas del Sur, Pol-Ka **Brazil ***Rede Globo, RecordTV, SBT, Band, Rede Manchete (defunct), Tupi (defunct) and Excelsior (defunct) **Chile ***TVN, Canal 13, Mega, Chilevisi√≥n **Colombia ***Caracol, RTI, RCN **Ecuador ***Ecuavisa, TC Televisi√≥n **Mexico ***Televisa, TV Azteca, Argos Comunicaci√≥n **Peru ***Am√©rica Televisi√≥n, ATV, Inka Visi√≥n **Puerto Rico ***WAPA-TV, WKAQ- TV **Venezuela ***Venevisi√≥n, RCTV, Marte TV, VTV *Europe **Spain ***Telecinco, Antena 3, EiTB (in Basque), TV3 (in Catalan) **Portugal ***RTP, TVI, SIC *Asia **Philippines ***ABS-CBN, GMA **East Timor ***RTTL **Turkey ***TRT, Kanal D, Star TV, ATV, Show TV, Kanal 7, TV8, Samanyolu TV (defunct) Telenovelas by country=Argentina Argentina's telenovelas generally focus on melodramatic twists of traditional middle class life, with touches of comedy. Many telenovelas are broadcast by the main television networks, Canal 13 and Telefe. Many popular \\"youth telenovelas\\", aimed primarily at children and teenagers, are produced in Argentina. Several youth telenovelas have become hits in other countries, where they have been remade or rebroadcast. Some well known youth telenovelas include Chiquititas (\\"Tiny Angels\\"), Rebelde Way, Floricienta, Mu√±eca Brava (\\"Wild Angel\\"), Violetta and Patito Feo (\\"Ugly Duckling\\"). Bolivia :See Red ATB, Bolivisi√≥n, Unitel Bolivia, Safipro and TeleArte. In Bolivia, themes of drama, romance, music, natural landscapes, remote situations and adventure are common. Some are based on novels, historical and factual events. Such melodramas produced in Bolivia include Las Tres Perfectas Solteras, Indira, Tierra Adentro, La Virgen de las 7 calles, Luna de Locos and Tres de Nosotras. The country has made over 15 telenovelas so far, and most of the productions take place in Santa Cruz de la Sierra. The majority of telenovelas shown on domestic television networks are international productions (imported from Brazil, Colombia, Argentina and Mexico). A lot of Bolivian telenovelas are produced by independent producers, since many producers are more dedicated to the country's film industry. Brazil :See Rede Globo, Rede Record, Sistema Brasileiro de Televis√£o, Rede Manchete, and Rede Tupi Brazilian telenovelas (more often \\"novelas\\") are both more realistic and apt to broach controversial subjects. These programs tend to showcase realistic depictions of middle class, working class and upper class individuals in society. Brazilian productions are the highest-budget telenovelas in South America. Escrava Isaura (1976) was a major hit in South America, the Eastern Bloc, Africa and China. Novelas usually last six to eight months at most in Brazil. One of the longest-running telenovelas in the country, however, is the teen-oriented Malha√ß√£o (Young Hearts), which has aired since 1995; as such, it is commonly classified as an Western-format soap opera instead. Brazilian telenovelas often have convoluted subplots involving three or four different settings. Usually, there is a rich setting, a poor setting and one or more settings in which the characters of both settings can interact. There is no clear-cut line between \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" characters, with protagonists often displaying weaknesses such as promiscuity, drinking, drug abuse, stupidity and excessive ambition, among others. Antagonists equally show positive features or motivations, including abuses suffered in the past, family problems and poverty. It is not uncommon for a villain to attract the sympathy of the public, or even to have their storylines conclude with a satisfactory ending. For instance, in the novela Bel√≠ssima (\\"Most Beautiful\\") in 2006, villainess Bia Falc√£o (played by Fernanda Montenegro) escaped a police siege and fled to France, where she settled with a boyfriend, living using a secret bank account in Switzerland that she had maintained prior. As well as this, it is not uncommon for a hero to be relegated to a secondary role due to an actor's lack of charisma. Besides the convoluted plots, Brazilian telenovelas also approach sensitive social issues and try to present some of the country's actual culture, occasionally in an idealized way. Another important characteristic of Brazilian telenovelas is that they rely less on individual stars than other South American works. A Brazilian telenovela may have a permanent cast of more than 40 actors, of which some seven or eight are considered \\"central\\" to the show. The chief reason for this is that telenovelas are not shot in advance (instead chapters are shot around two weeks before their airdate) so that they can respond to public reaction. Under this scheme, the eventual death or poor performance of the actor playing the main character may turn the production into a flop, which happened with the 1982 serial Sol de Ver√£o (\\"Summer Sun\\") after the death of main star Jardel Filho., and in 2016, in \\"Velho Chico\\" (\\"Old Frank\\", nickname for S√£o Francisco River), after the death of lead-actor Domingos Montagner. Canada :See Culture of Quebec, Television of Quebec and Television in Canada In Canada, telenovelas are known as t√©l√©romans in French and are a part of the culture of the Francophone province of Quebec. Nearly all television stations in the country that broadcast in the French language carry t√©l√©romans. The first t√©l√©roman was La famille Plouffe (\\"The Plouffe Family\\"), which was broadcast on Radio-Canada in the 1950s. The t√©l√©roman was created during the earliest days of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's television network, when CBC was the only television network in Canada (as per the 1949 Massey Commission). Whereas theoretically, CBC's main English-language television network could broadcast English-language shows from American stations (and also was forced to compete with U.S. television networks), CBC's Radio-Canada network had to develop its own programmes for French-Canadian viewers. As a consequence, Francophone television in Canada developed differently from Anglophone television. In 2003, Ontario's provincial French- language public television service, TFO, began broadcasting the first Franco- Ontarian t√©l√©roman, Francoeur. Beginning with its tenth season in 2010, Degrassi: The Next Generation was produced and broadcast in a style similar to the telenovelas format. This lasted until episode 21 of the twelfth season in 2012. Degrassi: Next Class also adapts this format for its broadcast on Family Channel. Chile Chilean telenovelas typically focus on both traditional drama and middle-class life, with some touches of comedy. Often, these programs show life outside of the capital, like with the TVN novela Iorana (which took place on Easter Island). Telenovelas in the country are usually produced and broadcast by Canal 13, and the public broadcaster Televisi√≥n Nacional de Chile (TVN), which debut their main telenovelas in March each year with a few days between their premiere dates, which have led marketing to a \\"telenovela war\\" of sorts. Lately, other Chilean television networks such as Mega and Chilevisi√≥n are joining the so-called \\"telenovela war\\". Many of the most successful telenovelas in Chile are set in a historical era such as Pampa Ilusi√≥n (1935), El Se√±or de la Querencia (1920), Los Pincheira (1918), Secretos en el jard√≠n (1981) or Perdona Nuestros pecados (1953‚Äì1961). Colombia :See Caracol TV, RTI Colombia, and RCN TV Colombian telenovelas such as Betty la fea (\\"Betty, the ugly one\\") often focus on comedic storylines. However, some are of a more realistic vein or are adaptations of novels. The first Colombian telenovela was El 0597 est√° ocupado, produced in 1959 by the programadora Producciones PUNCH.El 0597 est√° ocupado in Colarte From then until the late 1990s arrival of private television in the country, a variety of programadoras produced and aired their own telenovelas, such as those from Colombiana de Televisi√≥n, TeVecine, Cenpro Televisi√≥n (the producer of Perro amor, which was popular in the late 1990s). Telenovelas produced by RTI Colombia and Telemundo are usually shown and produced on Caracol, while Televideo and Fox Telecolombia produce some of RCN's telenovelas. Caracol and RCN also produce and broadcast their own shows. Currently, four or five Colombian telenovelas are usually broadcast from 6:00 to around 11:00 p.m. on those networks. It is notable that many novelas designed and written by Colombians sell outside the country well, as a prime export. Other countries then localize them by creating novelas based on the same story, barely changing names, settings and, more often than not, mixing the cast with Colombian actors to respect ownership/property agreements and copyright laws. One fine example is Betty, la fea (adapted by ABC in the United States as Ugly Betty) in which the franchise for the storyline was translated and adapted by over 30 networks around the world. Over the years, a new style of novelas/series have been produced by Caracol and RCN dubbed \\"narco-novelas\\" or \\"narco-series\\", including El Cartel, El Capo and Sin senos no hay para√≠so, which have been greatly successful in the American market and have achieved high ratings. These tend to focus on drug trafficking and situations related to it such as violence, mafiosos living luxurious hedonistic lives and women selling themselves to them in order to escape poverty. These stories have often been made in the format of television series even making seasons of these shows like El Cartel which consists of 2 seasons. Croatia The first Croatian telenovela was Villa Maria, made 2004 by AVA Production. After Villa Maria, AVA made Ljubav u zaleƒëu (2005‚Äì2006), Obiƒçni ljudi (2006‚Äì2007), Ponos Ratkajevih (2007‚Äì2008) and Zakon ljubavi (2008). Telenovelas made by AVA were aired in more than 25 countries. With Serbian FOX Televizija, RTL Televizija made Serbo-Croatian version of Yo soy Betty, la fea called Ne daj se, Nina (2007). After that RTL made Ru≈æa vjetrova (2011‚Äì2013), Tajne (2013‚Äì2014), Vatre ivanjske (2014-2015) and Prava ≈æena (2016‚Äì2017). Ring Multimedia production made Sve ƒáe biti dobro (2008‚Äì2009), Dolina sunca (2009‚Äì2010) and Pod sretnom zvijezdom (2011) for Nova TV. Nova TV itself made some telenovelas too: Najbolje godine (2009‚Äì2011), Larin izbor (2011‚Äì2013), Zora dubrovaƒçka (2013‚Äì2014), Kud puklo da puklo (2014‚Äì2016), Zlatni dvori (2016‚Äì2017) and ƒåista ljubav (2017‚Äì2018). Croatian telenovelas by AVA Production are very popular in Serbia too, so AVA created a branch office, AVA Film, in Serbia. AVA Film's first project is a Serbian telenovela called Zaustavi vreme. Dominican Republic Television networks in the Dominican Republic have started to produce their own novelas through Venevision International, Iguana Productions and Antena Latina Productions. The first Dominican telenovela, Mar√≠a Jos√©, oficios del hogar (\\"Mar√≠a Jos√©, Housewife\\"), was produced by Venevision and television station Color Visi√≥n, which formed the first Dominican telenovela company (now inactive) in 1986. Comedy-drama series such as Catalino el Dichoso and sequel En La Boca de los Tiburones were also considered telenovelas during the early 1990s. The telenovela Tropico was produced by Venevision International, Iguana Productions, and Antena Latina Productions, in 2007 with mostly Dominican actors and a few from Venezuela and Peru. It aired domestically on Antena Latina 7 and in United States on Univision. There are currently plans for more telenovelas to be filmed and produced in the Dominican Republic. Germany :See Bavaria Film Studios, Studio Hamburg Serienwerft and Grundy UFA In 2004, Germany began producing its own telenovelas. All German telenovelas are formatted as melodramatic love stories. With the exception of Storm of Love (\\"Sturm der Liebe\\"), which is produced by Bavaria Film Studios, and Rote Rosen which is produced by Studio Hamburg Serienwerft, every German telenovela is produced by Grundy UFA. The most successful ones, Bianca ‚Äì Wege zum Gl√ºck (\\"Bianca: Paths to Happiness\\"), Wege zum Gl√ºck (\\"Paths to Happiness\\"), Verliebt in Berlin (\\"In Love in Berlin\\"/\\"In Love with Berlin\\"), Storm of Love and Rote Rosen, were also syndicated in Italy, France and other European countries; Verliebt in Berlin was also syndicated in Canada. German television channels ARD, ZDF, Sat. 1 and ProSieben all include telenovelas on their programme schedules. Indonesia In Indonesia, a similar format exists called the sinetron (a portmanteau of sine, short for cinema and tron, from \\"electronic\\"), which are essentially soap operas in a miniseries-style format. While most English- language soap operas can continue indefinitely, almost all Sinetrons have a predetermined duration, usually running for only five-, six- or seven days a week and in total for more than five months. Sinetrons are usually made by production companies such as SinemArt and MD Entertainment. These programmes are usually broadcast on national television networks during the country's designated primetime period (6.00 to 11.00 pm), often a priority since these programme earn significant ratings, attracting advertisers. Malaysia In Malaysia, the equivalent of telenovela for a local language drama is '. The drama may last for 13 episodes for a weekly drama and more than 15 episodes if broadcast by a daily basis, usually three to five days a week. However, since almost all television broadcasters that air domestically produced dramas also air foreign dramas, Malaysian television dramas are less prolific compared to Indonesian, Philippine or South Korean dramas. Mexico Mexico was one of the first countries in the world to become known for producing telenovelas aimed at shaping social behavior ‚Äì one issue of which is family planning during the 1970s. The Mexican model of telenovelas ‚Äì quick to be replicated by other telenovela-producing countries in Latin America and Asia for most of the 1990s ‚Äì usually involves a romantic couple that encounters many problems throughout the show's run including a villain. One common ending archetype consists of a wedding and the villain dying, going to jail, becoming permanently injured or disabled, or losing their mind. The use of sexually themed episodes starring the leading couple of the story has been a common element through most Mexican (and Latin American) telenovelas. Televisa and TV Azteca are the largest producers and exporters of Mexican telenovelas. Their main competitor is independent company Argos Comunicaci√≥n. Telenovelas produced by U.S.-based network Telemundo tend to follow the Mexican model. Previously, telenovelas were often thought to be used as a government tool to distract citizens from national issues, a reason cited for temporary decrease in their credibility and popular appeal. Nowadays, Mexican television has managed to counteract government influence in its telenovelas. In particular, around 1990, Televisa found an enormous market for its telenovelas in regions such as Brazil and parts of Latin America, post-Cold War Eastern Europe and Asia. This precipitated the so-called 'Telenovela Craze'. Credited by media experts to Televisa's move in the early 1990s of exporting its telenovelas, it rivalled the wave of American sitcoms that were broadcast worldwide in the same period. During the peak of the global success of Latin American telenovelas in the 1990s and 2000s, several prominent Mexican actors and actresses gained huge following for the telenovelas that they starred in. For example, Ver√≥nica Castro's international fame grew when the novela she had starred in many years earlier, Los Ricos Tambien Lloran in 1979, became a major hit in Russia. In the same period, Thal√≠a earned the title as the \\"Queen of Soap Operas\\" after starring in the so-called Las Tres Marias or the \\"Maria Trilogy\\" telenovelas ‚Äì Maria Mercedes, Marimar and Maria la del Barrio ‚Äì and Rosalinda, converting her into one of the world's foremost television icons, as her telenovelas were broadcast in Mexico and more than 180 other countries to almost 2 billion viewers worldwide, earning the all-time highest television ratings both in Mexico and other regions. Due to the international success of the telenovelas broadcast in and out of Mexico, by the late 1990s, it was claimed that telenovelas were Mexico's leading export product. Many consider the period from 1958 to 2004 to be Televisa's Golden Age of telenovelas. At the same time the Mexican government loosened its control over television. Telenovelas, primarily those produced by Argos Comunicaci√≥n, consequently addressed new themes, including poverty, political corruption, immigration and drug smuggling. However, with American drama and comedy series becoming increasingly popular among Mexican audiences through cable or satellite television and unlicensed copying, the television companies opted to adapt stories from Argentina, Colombia and Brazil. These used veteran actors in order to decrease expenses. Currently, the most successful telenovelas are being created by Argos and Telemundo and are rebroadcast (or adapted) by the main companies. The most successful one, La Reina del Sur, based on the book by Arturo Perez Reverte, is based on the true story of a female drug trafficker in Sinaloa. Though it was censored somewhat due to the Drug War and was broadcast on a low-rated channel, it achieved higher viewership than other programs in the same timeframe. Peru Peruvian telenovelas, like other telenovelas, revolve around the character's personal lives. There are usually slight touches of comedy, drama and suspense. Al Fondo Hay Sitio has become one of the most famous telenovelas of Peru and has been shown around South America in Ecuador, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay. Philippines Domestically produced telenovelas first appeared on Philippine television in the 1960s, beginning with the ABS-CBN program Hiwaga sa Bahay na Bato. The format of Philippine telenovelas is almost the same as Spanish and Mexican telenovelas, as they have borrowed many elements including many clich√©s. However, Philippine telenovelas, which portray the reality of Filipino (as well as much of other Asian) societies, have evolved through decades and feature specific characteristics distinct from most of the world's telenovelas. The late 1980s and 1990s coincided with the end of martial law and the resulting expansion of commercial television networks as the Philippine government loosened controls over the press and media. With the help of simultaneous nationwide programming across the Philippines and the advent of the \\"telenovela craze\\" precipitated by Mexican telenovelas broadcast worldwide, previously dominant Filipino sitcoms had been largely replaced by domestically produced drama series airing on primetime television to encourage more competition among networks and reach out to more audiences across the nation. Examples of such classic telenovelas include Flordeluna, Villa Quintana, Mara Clara, Esperanza, Valiente, Kung Mawawala Ka, Mula Sa Puso and Sa Dulo Ng Walang Hanggan. Modern Philippine television dramas are usually termed teleserye, a portmanteau of the Filipino words \\"telebisyon\\" (\\"television\\") and \\"serye\\" (\\"series\\"), and are sometimes called P-drama overseas. The term \\"teleserye\\" originated in the 2000s from the ABS-CBN- produced Pangako Sa 'Yo, dubbed by the Philippine media as the first true teleserye as well as the most widely exported and most watched single Philippine television series abroad. In the 21st century, teleseryes may belong to one or several genres such as suspense, comedy, politics or fantasy, but featured several new variations from the previous Philippine telenovelas of the preceding century. Portugal The first Portuguese telenovela was Vila Faia, in 1982. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, almost all Portuguese telenovelas were broadcast by RTP. However, since the start of the 21st century, TVI has emerged as the most prolific broadcaster of Portuguese telenovelas. Morangos com A√ß√∫car, one of its most successful telenovelas, lasted for nine seasons. SIC, which usually imported telenovelas from Brazil's Rede Globo, has also started to produce its own telenovelas. Portuguese telenovelas have since exceeded telenovelas from neighboring Spain in terms of international popularity by the 2010s. In 2010, Portugal won the first Emmy for a Telenovela, with Meu Amor (\\"My Love\\"). In 2011, Portugal won its second consecutive International Emmy for a Telenovela with La√ßos de Sangue (\\"Blood Ties\\"). Portugal also sells telenovelas to Eastern Europe and America. Puerto Rico The telenovela genre was historically popular in the U.S. territory and there still is some interest to this day. The serials in days past were usually broadcast on domestic television stations three days a week at 6:30pm, with hour-long telenovelas airing at 7:00 and 9:00 p.m. during prime time. Production of telenovelas in Puerto Rico began in the 1950s with \\"Ante la ley\\" in 1955. Successful novelas to have come out of Puerto Rico have included La Mujer de aquella Noche, El Hijo de Angela Maria, El Cuarto Mandamiento, Tomiko, Cristina Bazan, El Idolo, Yo Se Que Mentia, Vivir Para Ti, Tanairi, Tres Destinos and many others. Russia Telenovelas were first introduced to Soviet viewers in 1988, when a stripped-down version of Escrava Isaura (running only 15 episodes) was shown on central television channel. The adaptation of that series was very popular with the Soviet viewers. An even bigger success was Los Ricos Tambi√©n Lloran, shown shortly afterwards. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russian TV channels commenced broadcasting telenovelas (usually those imported from Brazil) on a regular basis. Today, Latin American telenovelas are usually replaced by Russian-made alternatives. Serbia The first Serbian telenovela was made in 2004 by BK TV and its name is Jelena. After that RTV Pink made Ljubav i mr≈ænja (2007‚Äì2008). AVA Film (branch office of Croatian AVA Production) made Zaustavi vreme 2008, but it wasn't aired. A Serbian version of Graduados, Istine i la≈æi, was made by Prva Srpska Televizija and Smart Media Production. It currently airs on Prva Srpska Televizija. South Africa The first telenovela in South Africa was iNkaba, which was aired on Mzansi Magic. Inkaba was canceled after it flopped to lure in viewers. Isibaya was the first ever successful telenovela on the channel of Mzansi Magic. The most successful South African telenovela is Uzalo. Uzalo has over 10.25 million viewers in South Africa. Uzalo tells the story of two families in the township of Kwa-Mashu: the Mdletshe family which plays a significant role in the management of the Kwamashu Kingdom Church and the Xulu family which runs a car theft syndicate. The connection between the families is that their eldest sons were switched at birth during the period when Nelson Mandela was released from prison. Uzalo details the relationships and conflict between members of the two families as part of a complex story. Following the trend, other telenovelas started to flood in, with Mzansi Magic holding the monopoly of the genre with shows like Isithembiso, The Queen and The River among others. Other channels, such as e.tv and SABC, launched productions such as Keeping Score, Giyani: Land of Blood, High Rollers, Ashes To Ashes, Gold Diggers and Broken Vows. South Korea Korean telenovelas are often similar to a soap opera but without a neverending plot and frank sexual content. These dramas typically involve conflicts around dating and marital relationships, money problems, relationships between family members and in-laws (usually between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law), and often complicated love triangles. The heroine usually falls in love with the main character who may treat her badly for a while unlike the person who always cares for her. Korean telenovelas tend to run for 100+ episodes (rarely exceeding 200) and air from Monday to Friday. The main broadcasters and producers are KBS, MBC and SBS. South Korea became one of the world's largest Asian-based television drama producers at the start of the 21st century. Korean dramas have been exported globally and have contributed to the Korean Wave phenomenon known as Hallyu. Spain Spanish telenovelas are known in the nation as culebrones (Spanish of \\"long snakes\\") because of their convoluted plots. Broadcasters of telenovelas in the country are Telecinco, Antena3, and La 1; there are regional telenovelas produced in Basque and Catalan languages. They are produced by EITB (in Basque) and TV3 (in Catalan). However, Spain is not a producer of telenovelas so much as it is an importer of these programs. Telenovelas have also aided in the formation of a transnational 'Hispanic' identity, as the Venezuelan scholar Daniel Mato has suggested. The appeal of the genre lies in the melodramatic and often simplistic narrative which can be understood and enjoyed by audiences in a wide variety of cultural contexts. Bielby and Harrington have argued that this reverse flow has influenced soap operas in the United States, leading to \\"genre transformation,\\" especially with daytime soaps.4th edition published 2012, edited by Frank J.Lechner and John Boli, Wiley-Blackwell p.355 Turkey Turkey began producing its own telenovelas, also known in Turkish as televizyon dizileri, in the late 1990s at the same time that as the Philippines and South Korea began exporting their own television dramas as well in parts of the world. The storylines of Turkish dramas are usually based from the country's classic novels as well as historical settings (mostly during the Ottoman Empire period), and are known to have episodes lasting at least two hours each, much longer than an ordinary telenovela episode. These drama shows, in general, are of miniseries type, typically lasting for less than half a year, and are broadcast either as canned series or simultaneous telecasts in Turkey's key television markets with subtitles in multiple languages depending on the country outside Turkey where it has been aired. Turkish telenovelas have gained wide popularity and appeal among viewers especially in the Arab World and much of the Middle East as well as the Balkans, Eastern Europe, Russia, and Central and South Asia due in part to the picturesque cinematography. This exportation of dramas has been cited as one of Turkey's foremost strategies in boosting their popularity in these regions by promoting Turkish culture and tourism. As a result, these make up one of its most economically and culturally important international exports. International media experts have cited the 2010s as the biggest turning point of Turkish television production, which shifted to a balance of export of religious shows that were often widely viewed in these predominantly Islamic countries (with Ramadan known to be the most lucrative month of every television season in most Islamic countries for imported Turkish television shows) and secular shows tackling national issues of Turkey and even of the rest of the Islamic world. Some of the most internationally prominent Turkish television dramas include Muhte≈üem Y√ºzyƒ±l, Fatmag√ºl'√ºn Su√ßu Ne?, A≈ük-ƒ± Memnu and Binbir Gece. The rise of Turkish television drama on the international market attracted worldwide attention during this decade when it began gaining more viewers in Latin America, which is cited as a difficult market for foreign shows to be broadcast as its own produced telenovelas dominate programming there since the 1990s. Islamic conservatives in many Arab countries, however, condemn these Turkish shows as \\"vulgar\\" and \\"heretical\\" to Islam, as most of the prominent secular Turkish television series often have political undertones as well as a noticeable trend on emphasis of female empowerment, which contrasts the patriarchal nature of Islam. Nonetheless, Turkish television drama invokes wide impact too much of its 1 billion viewers from approximately 100 countries in the world, helping it surpass Latin America by the 2010s as the second largest exporter of television series worldwide after the United States. United States :See English language producers Fox Broadcasting Company and The CW :See Spanish language producers Univision and Telemundo :See MyNetworkTV telenovelas In the United States, the telenovela concept has been adapted into the English language. The first American telenovela was the soap opera Port Charles, which, although starting off as a traditional soap when it debuted in 1997, adopted a 13-week telenovela-style storyline format beginning in 2000 which continued in use until the show's cancellation in 2003. MyNetworkTV, an upstart network launched by News Corporation (now owned by 21st Century Fox), launched on September 5, 2006, with two nightly serials. The inaugural series Desire and Fashion House were moderately successful, however, ratings began to decline. The second pair of telenovelas, Wicked Wicked Games and Watch Over Me had decent ratings but were not as successful as its two predecessors. By the time the third batch of serials, American Heiress and Saints and Sinners debuted, ratings had declined significantly to where the network scaled back and eventually dropped the novela format in favor of reality-based series and specials by the fall of 2007. In contrast, ABC's adaptation of Betty la Fea, Ugly Betty, proved to be successful; however, the network opted to develop the show as a standard weekly series with elements of the comedic telenovela. An adaptation of the Venezuelan comedic telenovela Juana la virgen, Jane the Virgin, aired to success on The CW beginning in 2014, airing in a weekly format similar to other American series. NBC developed an adaptation of the racy Colombian telenovela Sin tetas no hay para√≠so called Without Breasts There Is No Paradise, however, it was never picked up to series. In 2001, after it was purchased by NBC (which later merged with Vivendi Universal to form NBCUniversal in 2003), Telemundo decided to stop importing Latin American telenovelas and produce its own. The network collaborated with RTI Colombia and Argos Comunicaci√≥n to co-produce its telenovelas, which follow the Mexican model, though Telemundo is a Puerto Rican firm. In order for its telenovelas to be recognized by the U.S. and Latin American audiences and even Spanish audiences, Telemundo chose to hire established telenovela actors from Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, and other Latin American countries; the network's novelas have since also hired American-born Hispanic actors. Telemundo's first telenovela co-productions were Amantes del Desierto (with RTI) and Cara o Cruz (with Argos) in 2001. The network also co-produced the 2002 novela Vale Todo in conjunction with Rede Globo, that series did not fare well in the ratings. In 2003, Telemundo began producing its novelas stateside in Miami, beginning with the RTI co-production Amor Descarado. Telemundo has experienced increasing success with its telenovelas, which have also been syndicated to Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, and Chile. Argos ended its co- production deal with Telemundo on December 31, 2006, with the last such co- production being Marina. Telemundo continues to co-produce telenovelas with RTI but has also started to produce these serials on its own. In 2005, the network opened Telemundo Television Studios in Miami, as a production studio for its telenovelas; Dame Chocolate also became the first telenovela to be fully produced by Telemundo. In 2006, Telemundo broadcast two telenovelas not created by the network or its partners, Amor M√≠o (co-produced by Televisa and Telefe) and La Esclava Isaura (produced by Rede Record). Cisneros Media Distribution (formerly Venevisi√≥n International) has also produced American- based telenovelas, which follow the Venezuelan story pattern and aired on Telemundo competitor Univision in the U.S. (in addition to being carried by main Venevisi√≥n network in Venezuela); its telenovelas portray the lives of Venezuelan Americans in the United States. Although a Venezuelan-owned company, Cisneros Media not only hired established telenovela actors from Venezuela, but also from other Latin American countries like Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Puerto Rico, etc. like in Telemundo, in order for its telenovelas to be recognized by the U.S., Latin American, and Spanish audiences. In recent years, Univision has also begun producing its own telenovelas for its primetime schedule. Some Spanish-language telenovelas are now translated into English. Univision and Telemundo provide closed captioning in English in order to attract English-speaking American viewers (primarily American-born Mexicans who are not fluent in Spanish), carried as the second or third caption channel depending on the station. Xenon Pictures also includes English subtitles on its DVD releases of Mexican serials. The sudden interest in English telenovelas can be attributed to the appeal and successful ratings of the genre. Producers also see this as a way to attract the fast-growing Mexican population, most notably the female sector of this demographic. In addition, telenovelas break the traditional production format in the United States, in which a television program runs for 20‚Äì25 episodes a season, on a once-weekly basis. Since 2010, Nickelodeon and its sibling networks have aired several programs produced in the style of telenovelas. These shows are usually broadcast in a daily-strip format over a one-month period. House of Anubis, based on a drama produced by its Dutch counterpart, was the first show produced for the network to adopt this format. Nickelodeon has since produced adaptions of some of its Latin American counterpart's telenovelas, including Every Witch Way (based on Grachi, Talia in the Kitchen (based on Toni la chef, and I Am Frankie (based on Yo soy Franky. The popular Canadian drama series, Degrassi, periodically used this format and aired daily during summer runs on Teennick. Venezuela :See RCTV, Venevisi√≥n and Televen Telenovelas in Venezuela are mainly produced by RCTV, Venevisi√≥n and Televen. Like Televisa in Mexico, Venevision controls a large portion of the entertainment industry in that country. Some of Venevision's telenovelas were also broadcast on Univision in the United States until the late 2000s. Some major telenovelas produced in Venevision include Amor Comprado, Dulce Enemiga, Cara Sucia, Bellisima and Pecado de Amor. Venezuela is one of the largest producers of telenovelas in the world, with up to 279 serials of this style have aired to date. Many of the major productions have been syndicated to Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, Peru, Ecuador, Spain, Italy, Japan, and the United States, among other countries. In the beginning, Venezuelan telenovelas followed the telenovela rosa format of a poor Cinderella who falls in love with Prince charming. Later in the 1980s, writers began writing realistic telenovelas that reflected everyday life of the common citizens where the audience could relate with the characters with telenovelas such as El sol sale para todos, Natalia de 8 a 9 and La se√±ora de C√°rdenas. The most famous of such telenovelas was Por est√°s calles which ran from 1992 to 1994. Another popular telenovela genre was the mystery telenovela which involved a serial killer with telenovelas such as Ang√©lica Pecado, La Mujer de Judas and La viuda joven which became successful during their original run and were sold to several countries around the world. In recent years, telenovela production has declined in the country especially after the closure of RCTV which was a major telenovela producer and exporter. Channels such as Venevisi√≥n end up producing only one national production per year. Government sanctions and regulations on media content has led to self- censorship of telenovela writers, also leading to reduced telenovela production. Awards The most important Telenovela award shows are the Mexican TVyNovelas Award, hosted by the Televisa-owned TVyNovelas magazine, and the award presented by Contigo in Brazil. TVyNovelas also has editions in Colombia, Chile, Puerto Rico, and the United States, while Contigo has an edition in Chile. In 2008, International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (IATAS) created a new International Emmy Award category for telenovelas produced and initially aired outside of the United States. Comparison with soap operas The standard American, British or Australian soap opera is of indefinite length, sometimes running for decades, with an ever-rotating cast of players and characters. However, most Latin American telenovelas have an average run of six months up to a year. The show's duration is pre-planned at the show's inception, with the overall story arc and conclusion also known by the show's creators and producers at its inception. Mundo de Juguete is one exception to the rule, with a total of 605 episodes (1974‚Äì1977), and a few cast changes during the course of the serial. Some earlier Argentine telenovelas (most of them written by Alberto Migr√©) had also run for a few years. Telenovelas also have a different type of story from English-language soaps, the typical telenovela story being focused on a rivalry between two or more people or families in romance or business. Many of them use stock themes like a Cinderella (who is a rival of the male protagonist's evil girlfriend), two brothers after one woman (or two sisters after one man) or mistaken/unknown parentage. Typically, the hero gets shot (or some form of fate equivalent to that).phorum ‚Äì Amarte As√≠ (Frijolito) forum . Foro.telenovela-world.com. Retrieved July 21, 2013. Telenovelas comprise the great majority of the dramatic productions by South American television networks, whereas in the United States, other formats like sitcoms or drama series are more popular on English language networks.

He is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of The Siegel Group Nevada, Inc., a real estate investment and management company that specializes in the acquisition, disposition and development of under-performing, value-added real estate and businesses with significant turn-around potential. The company has a portfolio valued in excess of $1 billion. Assets include a variety of businesses and a sizable commercial real estate portfolio comprising multi-residential, flexible-stay apartment complexes, extended-stay hotels, boutique resorts, hotel-casinos, retail, office, development land, restaurants and bars. The Siegel Group employs over 1,000 employees with professionals specializing in the areas of operations, management, legal, finance, marketing, branding, leasing, renovation, design, entitlements, construction, redevelopment and insurance.http://www.stephensiegel.com  Early life  Siegel dropped out of junior high and never attended high school. At the age of 15, after moving out of his family home to live on his own, Siegel supported himself by working at McDonald‚Äôs. Later, he met a friend whose father was a mechanic and owned a small repair shop where he observed the father and son repair the cars that came and went from the shop. Crediting this experience for instilling in him a desire to fix problems, Siegel began using this newfound knowledge to his benefit by buying cars which he customized to his friend‚Äôs specifications and quickly sold for a profit. With no bank account, and only a few thousand in savings, Siegel operated his business by saving what little money he could. He attributes this time in his life with being instrumental in developing his passion for buying, fixing and selling assets of all types. Initial Business Ventures= Unique Sounds  At the age of 19, Siegel invested what savings he had accumulated from his car venture, partnering with a friend to open Unique Sounds - a car stereo and alarm store. He operated this business all the while continuing to sell the cars he was able to restore for a profit. He ultimately agreed to sell his interest in the operation back to his partner so that he could pursue other business interests. Just one week after finalizing this transaction, Siegel narrowly avoided losing his entire investment as the business he had helped found was destroyed by vandals during the 1992 Los Angeles riots.  Prestige Motors  At the age of 21, Siegel embarked on his first solo venture, founding Prestige Motors, a one-bay mechanical auto repair shop which he ultimately repositioned as a collision center. Over the next six years, he grew this business to where it was generating annual sales in excess of $2 million at which point he sold the business to focus on other business interests.  Uncle Howie Products  After selling Prestige Motors Siegel utilized the proceeds to acquire a 45% stake in Uncle Howie Products, a struggling business involved in the manufacturing of children‚Äôs upholstered furniture. The company was immediately restructured under Siegel who used his business know-how to expand operations and increase sales(Howard increased sales, Steve ran the inside operations) and efficiency. He expanded the business from a 50 employee venture operating out of a small warehouse to one that employed over 100 employees working 24-hour production shifts in new manufacturing space that exceeded 54,000 square feet. Howard Napolske AKA \\"Uncle Howie\\" successfully negotiated, secured and managed licensing for brands such as Nickelodeon‚Äôs Blues Clues, Mattel‚Äôs Barbie, Pok√©mon and Betty Boop and expanded the company‚Äôs product line into national retailers including Sears, Target, JCPenney and Toys \\"R\\" Us, accelerating annual income from $1 million to over $8 million in one year.  McAlister‚Äôs Collision Centers  In 2000, Siegel acquired McAlister‚Äôs Auto Body - a failing business originally established in 1975 that suffered from significant cash flow problems, poor management and an aging founder. He completely revamped and rebranded the business changing the name to McAlister‚Äôs Collision Centers and worked diligently to initiate an aggressive and effective change in daily operations. Staff was increased, accounts were established with local automotive dealerships and new insurance companies and weak relationships with existing insurance carriers were restored to further increase sales. Within the first six months of Siegel taking over daily operations, monthly sales dramatically increased from $50,000 to $500,000. Four years later, annual sales had skyrocketed to over $8 million. McAlister‚Äôs Collision Centers flourished under Siegel‚Äôs leadership, expanding to a second location. Siegel ultimately exited the automotive collision center business to focus on the development and expansion of his real estate portfolio and entrepreneurial ventures. Real Estate Development It was while operating McAlister‚Äôs Collision Centers that Siegel began to gradually acquire commercial real estate using the same principles he had used selling cars. He had a penchant for problem properties with upside potential that were undervalued and suffered from a host of problems including deferred maintenance, under-market rents and low-occupancy and significant rehabilitation issues. Siegel formed a property management company that operated out of his body shop to oversee his real estate holdings which grew to include a variety of assets including multi-residential, industrial, office, retail, mixed-use, shopping centers and land. Today Siegel‚Äôs commercial real estate portfolio spans the United States and comprises over 100 properties that are operated under distinct business brands that he developed and continues to grow. Recognition In March 2009, the City of Las Vegas, Mayor pro tem Gary Reese and Mayor Oscar Goodman named Stephen Siegel as the Citizen of the Monthhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5Le3IgnWuw in recognition of his many past and present redevelopment projects relating to his Las Vegas properties and his continued support of the city and its revitalization efforts. Siegel‚Äôs focus on improving properties and cleaning up the surrounding areas has resulted in safer neighborhoods and led to the creation of numerous jobs for Las Vegas residents in a variety of industries. Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman has said that \\"Siegel‚Äôs practice of buying lost- cause properties overrun by drugs and crime and renovating them into viable, safe residences solves two problems at once, blight and the need for quality, safe, lower-income housing\\".http://www.portfolio.com/companies- executives/2010/04/08/stephen-siegel-takes-on-las-vegas-real-estate/ Inc. magazine recognized the Siegel Group as one of the fastest growing private businesses in America in 2007 and 2008.http://www.inc.com/profile/the-siegel- group Las Vegas Weekly named Siegel Las Vegas's Best Entrepreneur in 2010.http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/2010/may/27/entrepreneur-stephen- siegel/ References Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:American hoteliers Category:American real estate businesspeople Category:American entertainment industry businesspeople Category:American casino industry businesspeople ","title":"Steve Siegel"},{"id":"26536206","text":"Jonathan Wright (born 8 March 1987) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who most recently played for the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles in the National Rugby League.

Barbican Centre, London, United Kingdom In the mid-1990s, a cosmetic improvement scheme by Theo Crosby, of the Pentagram design studio, added statues and decorative features reminiscent of the Arts and Crafts movement. In 2005‚Äì2006, the centre underwent a more significant refurbishment, designed by architects Allford Hall Monaghan Morris and Roger Westman, which improved circulation and introduced bold signage in a style in keeping with the centre's original 1970s Brutalist architecture. That improvement scheme added an internal bridge linking the Silk Street foyer area with the lakeside foyer area. The centre's Silk Street entrance, previously dominated by an access for vehicles, was modified to give better pedestrian access. The scheme included removing most of the mid-1990s embellishments. Outside, the main focal point of the centre is the lake and its neighbouring terrace. The theatre's fly tower has been surrounded by glass and made into a high-level conservatory. The Barbican Hall's acoustic has also been controversial: some praised it as attractively warm, but others found it too dry for large-scale orchestral performance. In 1994, Chicago acoustician Larry Kirkegaard oversaw a ¬£500,000 acoustic re-engineering of the hall \\"producing a perceptible improvement in echo control and sound absorption\\", music critic Norman Lebrecht wrote in October 2000\\"Concert-Hall Blues ‚Äì Oh for an Acceptable Symphonic Environment\\", Lebrecht Weekly, 11 October 2000 on scena.org.

The members are Robin Juhkental, Jakob Juhkam, Siim Raidma, Ott Adamson, Johan Alexander Petti and Hans Kurvits. The original lineup consisted of Robin Juhkental (vocals/electronics) and Madis Kubu (bass). Juhkental has described their style as \\"electronic pop with a slightly quirky undertone\\". The band's name originates from the game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, where a woman incorrectly answered \\"Malcolm Lincoln\\" to a question involving the first name of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States. Malcolm Lincoln, together with a group of backing vocalists called Manpower 4, won the competition Eesti Laul 2010 with the song \\"Siren\\" and represented Estonia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010. The band released their debut album Loaded With Zoul in May 2010. History Malcolm Lincoln first started out as a solo-project of Robin Juhkental, when in the autumn of 2009 he uploaded his first songs to MySpace under the name Malcolm Lincoln. Later, he asked Madis Kubu to join him for their first gig on 31 October 2009 in Tallinn. In December, Vaiko Eplik, an Estonian singer-songwriter and producer, contacted Juhkental and offered releasing a small volume of records under his label Mortimer Snerd and with himself as the producer. Later, Juhkental submitted two potential songs from the upcoming album ‚Äì \\"I'm Still Standing Here\\" and \\"Siren\\" ‚Äì to the song contest Eesti Laul 2010. \\"Siren\\" was picked as one of the 10 final songs and later exited the final competition, held on 12 March, as the winning song. It was performed together with a vocal quartet Manpower 4. As a result of winning Eesti Laul 2010, Malcolm Lincoln represented Estonia at the Eurovision Song Contest 2010. In the end of April 2010, Malcolm Lincoln signed an artist contract with Universal Music. The band released their debut album Loaded With Zoul on 20 May 2010. They performed at the first semi-final of Eurovision Song Contest on 25 May 2010 in B√¶rum, but failed to qualify for the final. In February 2011, Malcolm Lincoln went through a line-up change and Ott Adamson and Jakob Juhkam were added to the band.

In 1873, he laid out the town of Napavine where he was Postmaster and ran the general store. He chose the town's name from the Indian word \\"napavoon\\" meaning small prairie. Early years Urquhart was born in Dingwall, Ross-Shire, Scotland. Cromarty and the Black Isle had been the home of the Clan Urquhart since ancient times. He left Ross-shire as a teenager going first to Arbroath on the North Sea coast where he learned the merchant's trade in an uncle's store. He then moved on to Linlithgow where he worked on the new railroad that was being constructed, married a local girl by the name of Helen Muir, and started a family of his own. Emigrant to America In 1851 Urquhart left his growing family in Scotland and sailed to New York City. He crossed the country, initially traveling through the antebellum south on foot to New Orleans, then up the Mississippi River by boat, and finally joining a wagon train and heading west on the Oregon Trail to the Oregon Territory. After working at several different jobs along the Columbia River, he filed a Donation Claim, homesteaded north of the river and voted in the first election in the newly created Washington Territory. His wife and children joined him in early 1855, sailing around Cape Horn on a journey that took six months. Washington Territory In 1855 the Washington Territory was thinly populated. The Urquhart family set off into the wilderness by canoe on the Cowlitz River, settling near Cutting's prairie. By 1870 seven additional Urquhart children (six survived infancy) had been added to five who had journeyed from Scotland with their mother. The entire family cleared fields, raised animals and crops and honed the skills of pioneer living. Urquhart served in the Lewis County militia in 1856. Because he had good relations with the local tribes, he did not take his family to the block house at Claquato for protection during the Yakima Indian uprisings of 1855-6. By 1873 James Urquhart had greatly expanded his land holdings. He purchased a small outpost and the merchandise of his pioneer neighbor H. H. Pinto and laid out a town around it. He named the town Napavine. He ran the general store for many years and saw the railroad come to his town. He was three times elected to the Territorial Legislature,http://www.leg.wa.gov/History/Territorial/Documents/territorial_assembly_members.pdf was appointed Postmaster, was a county commissioner and a delegate to the constitutional convention, and served on the school board. He returned to Scotland for a brief visit after the death of his wife of 51 years and spent the last years of his life surrounded by family and old pioneer friends, many of whom lie near him in the Fernhill/Urquhart Cemetery in Chehalis. Family in Public Service In his book \\"History of the Puget Sound Country\\" William Farrand Prosser, one of the founders of the Washington Historical Society, wrote personal histories of many prominent pioneers and their families. James Urquhart and his son William Muir Urquhart were both profiled in this book. William had served as Mayor of Chehalis, a town he and his business associates had played a role in developing. He also served as Postmaster and Treasurer of Lewis County. His brother John held these same two positions before his premature death. His brother David became Auditor of Lewis County and another brother, Henry, served many years as Lewis County Sheriff . Another brother, Alexander, became Postmaster of Rufus, Oregon.

Playing at half back, he also made two appearances for Wales in 1876 and 1877. Football career Born in Wrexham, Cross was a keen cricketer and a member of the Wrexham Cricket Club. On 4 October 1864, in search of a sporting activity for the winter months, he attended a meeting held at the Turf Hotel in Wrexham, which led to the formation of the Wrexham Association Football Club. Four years later, he attended the inaugural meeting of the Football Association of Wales held at the Wynnstay Arms Hotel, Wrexham on 2 February 1876. He also took part in trials organised by Llewelyn Kenrick to select Welsh players to represent their country in a match against Scotland. The match was played at Hamilton Crescent, Partick, the home of the West of Scotland Cricket Club on 25 March 1876, with Cross playing at right-half in a 2‚Äì2‚Äì6 formation. The Welsh were well defeated, conceding four goals without reply. The return match came on 5 March 1877 at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham, with Cross, described as \\"an energetic half-back\\", playing at centre-half; the Scots were again victorious, winning 2‚Äì0. Later that year, he was part of the Wrexham team that entered the inaugural Welsh Cup tournament. After defeating the local Civil Service in the first round, they had victories over Oswestry and Gwersyllt Foresters (8‚Äì0). With only three teams remaining in the tournament at this stage, Wrexham received a bye to the final, at Acton Park, Wrexham, on 30 March 1878 between Wrexham and Druids from Ruabon. The match was a cliffhanger, with no score until the Wrexham forwards charged the Druids' defenders to take the ball over the line to win the game in the final minute, with James Davies being credited with the goal. The following year, Wrexham again reached the final of the Cup, this time losing 1‚Äì0 to Newtown White Star. Career outside football Cross was employed as a clerk with the Alliance Insurance Company in Wrexham and later in Shrewsbury, before becoming an accountant. After retiring from playing football in 1879, he continued to play as a leading batsman with Wrexham Cricket Club for several years. He died at Old Colwyn, Denbighshire on 19 January 1924. His nephew, also E A Cross, was later a director of Wrexham Football Club and an alderman in the town.

This plant was used by various indigenous peoples to treat medical problems such as diarrhea and fever. Name and description The plant grows 1‚Äì5 ft (about 30‚Äì150 cm) high, producing a cluster of small, yellow, 5-parted flowers on a hairy stalk above pinnate leaves. The fruits are hooked dry seeds grouped in a cluster. A spicy scent is released when the stem is crushed.Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center Retrieved 2010-03-13.Robert W. Freckmann Herbarium University of Wisconsin - Stevens Point Retrieved 2010-03-13. The plant's native range covers most of the United States and Canada (except the Rocky Mountains) and extending south to Chiapas, Mexico. It grows in woodlands and forests. The specific epithet, gryposepala, is derived from the Greek grypos, meaning curved or hooked,Henry Liddell and Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, online at the Perseus Project. and from sepala, meaning sepal. The name \\"grooveburr,\\" which is sometimes applied to the plant, comes from the grooved shape of the seedpod or burr. Conservation status in the United States It is listed as threatened in Kentucky. Uses Across North America, various indigenous peoples used the plant for medicinal purposes. Among the Iroquois people, a drink made from the roots of the plant was used for diarrhea. Among the Cherokee, the plant was used for the same purpose, to reduce fever, and for a range of other problems. The Ojibwe used the plant for urinary problems, and the Meskwaki and Prairie Potawatomi used it as a styptic for nosebleeds. These ethnobotanical uses of the plant have some similarities to the traditional medical uses of Agrimonia eupatoria, which is native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.

A third armoured division, in addition to the two (3rd and 6th) that deployed to the 1973 war, appears in the 1975‚Äì76 edition. but disbanded in 1982. It was reformed after 2004. History The division was formed as part of the buildup of the Iraqi Army after the Yom Kippur War. Pesach Malovany says it was 'newly established' in the leadup to the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. Before the war it was garrisoned in the An Nasiriyah area as part of the 3rd Corps.Malovany 2017, 83. In British military attache reporting of 1977-78 it was listed with the 3rd Corps, with its headquarters at Samawa, with the 14th Mechanised and 43rd and 45th Armoured Brigades. It saw its first action in the initial Iraqi invasion of Khuzestan.Malovany 2017, 122-125. It fought in several battles in 1980‚Äì81, but then was so badly beaten in the First Battle of al-Basrah (Operation Ramadan), in July 1982, that it was disbanded. The 9th Division was the only Iraqi division to be disbanded without being reformed during the war.Pollack, Arabs at War, 2002, p. 204‚Äì205 Because the number nine had become unlucky in the Iraqi Army due to the division's severe losses, it was decided not to rebuild it, but instead to transfer what personnel and equipment was left to the new 17th Armoured Division (Iraq), which had just been formed within the 2nd Corps.Malovany 2017, 209, 214. The division was reformed after the recreation of the Iraqi Army began after 2003. A 2006 article in ARMY Magazine described how the division was being built from the 'wreckage of the old Republican Guard. ..[i]ts facilities occupy the greater portion of Camp Taji, Iraq, in scores of refurbished buildings that once belonged to the Republican Guard, and much of its equipment was salvaged' from the old regime's junk. T-55 tanks and 'armoured personnel carriers for two of its three brigades were cobbled together from battle-damaged vehicles..' at Camp Taji. Contractors rebuilt functioning equipment from the scrap. Used T-72 tanks for the division's third brigade were to be purchased from a former Soviet Bloc country. It was certified and assumed responsibility of the battle space of north Baghdad Governorate on June 26, 2006. In September 2006, ARMY Magazine said that two of the division's brigades had already been fielded and were operationally partnered with U.S. Army units. The division had carried out its first command post exercise in the northern summer of 2006. One of the division's commanders has been General Riyadh Jalal Tawfiq, who was eventually promoted to Lieutenant General and took over the Ninevah Operational Command (NOC). The Institute for the Study of War, describing Riyadh's assumption of command of the NOC, said that the 9th Division had controlled the Rusafa area of eastern Baghdad, and that Riyadh had been credited with helping secure that 'key district.' Other divisional commander have included Major General Bashar Mahmood Ayob (2006) and, as of April 2009, Major General Qassim Jassem Nazal.  Composition  The 9th Armoured Division has a territorial security mission in the region north of Baghdad, but it is also one of the principal reaction rapid formations of the Iraqi Army. After the renumbering of brigades of the army, its subordinate formations included: * Division Headquarters ‚Äì Taji * 34th Armored Brigade (Desert Lions) [M1A1/M113] * 35th Mechanized Brigade [T-90S.] * 36th Armored Brigade [M1A1/M113] * 37th Mechanized Brigade [T72/BTR80/EE9 ‚Äì converting to M113s, BTR80/EE9s expected to transfer to ISOF. T-72 Tank Rgt has trained on M1A1s indicating a planned future upgrade.] The artillery is a mix of M198, M109, and BM21s in the 9th Armoured Division. As the 9th Armoured Division upgrades, its older armor [T55/T72/BMP1/MTLBs] has been redistributed to other Iraqi Divisions: * 3 bns of BMP1s to 6th [2 Bns] and 8th Divisions * 2 Rgts of T55s to 3rd and 14th Divisions * 3 Rgts of T72s to 2nd, 10th, and 12th Divisions Of note, 9th Division provides armor instructors to the Iraqi Armor School. The presence of BTR-4s in 9th Divisions has never been confirmed as anything except training elements. Its 4th Brigade received 35 refurbished EE-9 Cascavel armoured cars from the United States in January 2008; these are now operated by the 37th Mechanized. In the prelude to the American withdrawal from Iraq, additional purchases of LAV-25s and parts for mothballed French Panhard AML-90s were also reported ‚Äì presumably to supplement the other reconnaissance vehicles already in service. In 2018, the 35th Brigade was reequipped with T-90S tanks. The brigade's M1A1s were transferred to the 34th Brigade.

Euforia's real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans. Euforia has a son, also wrestling in CMLL, as Soberano Jr. Euforia is a part of a wrestling group called Los Guerreros del Infierno under the leadership of √öltimo Guerrero, the group also includes Niebla Roja. He was formerly part of the groups Los Nuevos Infernales led by El Sat√°nico and later Virus, followed by Los Cancerberos del Infierno (\\"The Infernal Cerberusses\\") with Virus, Raziel, Cancerbero and P√≥lvora, while also forming a tag team with Nosferatu. Personal life As Euforia has never been unmasked in the ring via a Lucha de Apuestas (\\"Bet match\\") his real name is not a matter of public knowledge, a lucha libre tradition where the names of enmascarados (masked wrestlers) are not reported on. He was born on December 5, 1974 in Torre√≥n, Coahuila, Mexico, son of Pablo Moreno Rom√°n. Moreno was a professional wrestler known under the ring name \\"El Soberano\\" (\\"the Sovereign\\"). Euforia's older brother, Pablo Moreno Leon, wrestled under the ring name Stranger until his death in 2000. A younger brother works under the ring name \\"El Hijo del Soberano\\" (\\"The son of El Soberano\\"). Euforia's son, born August 12, 1993, followed in his father's and grandfather's footsteps and became a professional wrestler in 2007. He was originally known as \\"El Niete del Soberano\\" (\\"The Grandson of El Soberano\\") but is better known under the ring name El Soberano Jr. / El Soberano, both of which are used interchangeably. Professional wrestling career The wrestler currently known as Euforia made his professional wrestling debut on May 28, 1990 under the name \\"Soberano Jr.\\" (\\"Sovereign Jr.\\"). He wrestled for many years alongside both his father and his brother on the Mexican independent circuit, especially around his home region in Torre√≥n, Coahuila. Soberano made his Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) debut on April 23, 2006, in the second match of the show. He only wrestled a limited number of matches before disappearing from CMLL shows. In 2007 Soberano Jr. returned to the CMLL rings, but had been repackaged as \\"Euforia\\", a darker Rudo character (a \\"heel\\", those that portray the villains in wrestling) that was teamed up with El Sat√°nico and Nosferatu to form Los Nuevos Infernales (\\"The New Infernals\\"), the latest incarnation of the Los Infernales group. In June 2007, Euforia was one of eight Novatos (rookies) that participated in the 2007 Gran Alternativa tournament, where an experienced wrestler teams up with a newcomer. Euforia teamed up with top Rudo √öltimo Guerrero for the tournament, defeating S√∫per Comando and Villano V in the first round and Dos Caras Jr. and Valiente in the second round to earn a spot in the finals. The 2007 Gran Alternativa finals saw M√≠stico and La Sombra defeat √öltimo Guerrero and Euforia. In June 2008, Los Nuevos Infernales entered a tournament for the vacant CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship. In the first round Euforia and Nosferatu defeated Los Rayos Tapatio, in the second round they beat Metallik and Met√°lico and in the third round they eliminated √Ångel Azteca Jr. and M√°scara Purpura to earn a spot in the finals. The final match saw Flash and Stuka Jr. defeat Los Nuevos Infernales to win the Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship. Following their loss Los Nuevo Infernales began a long running rivalry with Flash and Stuka Jr., a rivalry that saw Euforia and Nosferatu unsuccessfully challenge for the Arena Coliseo Tag Team titles on December 14, 2008. Euforia and Nosferatu defeated the champions in a non-title match at CMLL's La Hora Cero pay-per- view on January 11, 2009. By mid-2009 Euforia and Nosferatu teamed less and less. Nosferatu was replaced by Skandalo in a trios match that saw Eurforia, Virus and Skandalo defeat Flash, Stuka Jr. and Metalico on the undercard of the 2009 Infierno en el Ring event. Los Cancerberos del Infierno (2009‚Äì2012) On November 18, 2009 CMLL presented a new Rudo group that they had formed, Los Cancerberos del Infierno (\\"The Infernal Cerberus\\") a team led by veteran mid-ranked worker Virus and consisted of Euforia and P√≥lvora as well as two new characters never used before - Raziel and Cancerbero. It was later revealed that Raziel and Cancerbero were not two new wrestlers CMLL brought in but actually two low card wrestlers that had been repackaged, Raziel was previously known as Caligula while Cancerbero was called Messala. In late 2009 P√≥lvora teamed up with Euforia and Virus to represent Los Cancerberos in a tournament to crown the new Mexican National Trios Champion. The team defeated Los √Ångeles Celestiales (√Ångel Azteca Jr., √Ångel de Plata and √Ångel de Oro) in the first round, but lost to eventual tournament winners Mascara Dorada, Stuka Jr. and Metro in the second round. Following the tournament loss Los √Ångeles Celestiales and Los Cancerberos del Infierno have developed a rivalry between the two groups, facing off on various CMLL shows, including their Friday night CMLL Super Viernes show. In early 2010 Euforia was entered in the inaugural Parejas Incredibles Nacional tournament, a tournament where CMLL groups a tecnico and a Rudo together for a contest where teams represent the region they trained in. Euforia teamed up with Ephesto to form the only \\"all rudo\\" team in the group. In the first round Euforia and Ephesto lost to tournament favorites M√≠stico and Averno. In April 2012, Euforia and CMLL World Heavyweight Champion El Terrible won the 2012 Gran Alternativa. The same month he entered the En Busca de un √çdolo tournament/reality television show, where he made it to the finals before losing to Tit√°n. Los Guerreros Laguneros (2012‚Äìpresent) On July 6, 2012, Euforia was named the newest member of √öltimo Guerrero's Los Guerreros del Infierno stable. In January 2013, Euforia made his Japanese debut, when he took part in the three-day Fantastica Mania 2013 event, co-promoted by CMLL and New Japan Pro Wrestling in Tokyo. During the first night on January 18, he teamed with Okumura in a tag team match, where they were defeated by Tama Tonga and Tit√°n. The following night, Euforia was defeated in a singles match by Atlantis. During the third and final night, Euforia teamed with Kazuchika Okada and Mephisto in a six-man tag team main event, where they were defeated by Atlantis, Hiroshi Tanahashi and Prince Devitt. Euforia was teamed up with tecnico Diamante Azul for the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles (\\"National Incredible Pairs Tournament\\") where the concept was that rivals would team up for a tag team tournament. The team defeated √Ångel de Oro and Ephesto in the tournament's first round, but lost to Atlantis and √öltimo Guerrero in the second round. A year later, Euforia won the 2014 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles tournament teaming with Atlantis. On March 28, 2014, Euforia won his first title, when he, Niebla Roja and √öltimo Guerrero defeated Los Estetas del Aire (M√°scara Dorada, M√≠stico and Valiente) for the CMLL World Trios Championship. They lost the title to Sky Team (M√≠stico, Valiente and Volador Jr.) on February 13, 2015. Euforia was a participant in the 2017 International Gran Prix. He was eliminated from the torneo cibernetico by Kenny King on September 1. On July 1, 2018, Los Guerreros Lagunero ended Sky Team's 1,223-day reign with the CMLL World Trios Championship as they defeated them in the main event of CMLL's Domingos Arena M√©xico show. Subsequently, Los Guerreros were positioned as \\"Defenders of CMLL\\" as they began a storyline feud with \\"The Cl4n\\" (Ciber the Main Man, The Chris and Sharlie Rockstar), three wrestlers who had made a name for themselves in CMLL's main rival Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide. On September 14, The Cl4n won the trios championship, followed by Los Guerreros regaining the championship two weeks later on September 28. 2018.

The video was allegedly recorded on the eve of Chinese New Year day. Following the incident, the Amateur Swimming Union of Malaysia (ASUM) suspended the allowances of the seven national divers with immediate effect with more disciplinary action set to follow. Pandelela and the six other divers apologised publicly and promised the incident will not be repeated. ASUM announced later that no further action will be taken to the seven divers as the divers have already expressed remorse for their actions.

Originally this would have served as a temporary watering hole for wildlife, including the American bison. Wallowing buffalo that drank from and bathed in these naturally occurring shallow water holes gradually changed the pristine watering hole into a buffalo wallow. Each time they went away, they carried mud with them from the hole, thus enlarging the wallow.Conway, Sr., Emmett A. \\"Buffalo Wallow on Pancake Trail\\". Retrieved May 27, 2011. Furthermore, wallowing action caused abrasion of hair, natural body oils and cellular debris from their hides and left the debris in the water and especially in the soil after the water evaporated. Every year the debris accumulated in the soil in increasing concentration and formed a water- impenetrable layer that prevented the rain water and runoff from percolating into the lower layers of the soil. Ultimately the water remained for long periods which attracted more wildlife. Even when stagnant, the water would be eagerly drunk by thirsty animals.Munroe, Kirk (1891). Campmates: A Story of the Plains, Chapter XXVI. Retrieved September 1, 2011. Though thriving buffalo herds roamed and grazed the great prairies of North America for thousands of years, they have left few permanent markings on the landscape to recall their past presence. Exceptions are the somewhat rare yet still visible ancient buffalo wallows found occasionally on the North American prairie flatlands. Buffalo wallows are also made by the Asian water buffalo and the African buffalo.

April, 2010, by Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) (in English: North German Broadcasting).  Design  Studio photo of Henry E. Steinway taken by the photographer Mathew Brady Virtually all critical design elements of the Steinway 'D' were developed during the 19th century. Among them are the action and string scale designs perfected by Henry Steinway Jr., the company founder's son; the hammers, cast iron frame and laminated wooden rim, all originating in designs patented by C.F. Theodor Steinway, another of the founder's sons; the trapwork (pedals), first devised by Albert Steinway, a third son; and most aspects of the soundboard. Since those early years, only two notable improvements have been made: a concentric shaping of the soundboard, a design patented by younger family member Paul Bilhuber, was introduced in 1936; more recently the Steinway action was changed to provide a greater mechanical advantage to the player, resulting in less touch resistance with no loss of power.\\"Today's Pianos Have Prelude In Yesterday's; Steinway Family Legacy Pervades Factory in Queens,\\" The New York Times, July 19, 2003 (accessed March 24, 2010)  History  Early Centennial D-270 built Sept 1877 (constructed case) being erected after transport Even before the German-born family emigrated to the United States, the founder, Henry E. Steinway, had built a grand piano in 1836 (the so-called \\"kitchen grand\\"), which today is preserved at the Steinway Hall in New York City. Such grand pianos with a limited keyset of 6 or 6.5 octaves and double strings produce less volume of sound than a D-type concert grand piano.Ronald V. Ratcliffe: Steinway. Chronicle Books, San Francisco (USA) 1989, . Concert grand pianos of full size are able to fill a concert hall with sound for 2,000 to 3,000 spectators. This was foreshadowed in the 1860s when grand pianos were given harps or frames of cast iron. Initially employed to accommodate the cumulative and extraordinary tension of the strings, thereby protecting the wooden structure from destruction, iron frames quickly facilitated a dramatic increase in string tension. With increased string tension came increased power and projection. At the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, there were several manufacturer's competitions, including a piano competition. The Steinway company sent two grand pianos displaying their latest developments, demonstrating the firm's innovative and markedly improved piano quality. Their determined pursuit of quality was rewarded at the world exhibition with a gold medal. Steinway won the competition against several established, well-known American piano makers, including Chickering and Sons and Weber. This Steinway concert grand piano, the direct predecessor of today's Model 'D', has become known as the \\"Centennial grand\\". It remained in production until 1878, when improvements prompted the Steinways to re-designate their models, replacing numeric designations (Types 1 through 4) with Model letters, i.e., A, B, C and D. These letters still mark the types of Steinway's four largest instruments. This was a time of remarkable advance: *The open pinblock was discarded in favor of the full frame. :Always mindful of production as well as excellence, Steinway realized that covering the pinblock with the plate would save manufacturing costs. Open blocks had necessitated multiple levels (to account for the height difference between the bass and treble bridges), whereas this disparity could be easily compensated for in the full frame casting. Further, the pinblock was no longer visible and as such needed no cosmetic treatment such as an attractive veneer. *The capo d'astro bar displaced agraffes in the upper treble sections. :While agraffes continue to be used in the bass, tenor and lower treble of modern instruments, earlier pianos also employed them in the upper treble. The massively cast capo bar, an integral part of the plate, enhanced the clarity and power of the upper treble *The pedal lyre was strengthened dramatically, and the pedals redesigned as a self-contained unit. :Pedaling became more reliable and precise, and withstood violent pedaling that often accompanies violent playing. *String lengths and tensions increased dramatically, and hammers were made heavier and employed denser felt. :These and other improvements remarkably enhanced the performance, power and brilliance of the new Steinway 'D', enabling it to fill ever-expanding concert venues with sufficient sound.  Development of the modern D-274  Steinway Artist Daniel Barenboim, age 11, plays a D-274 with the conductor Moshe Lustig and the Gadna symphony orchestra in Israel on August 1st, 1953 In 1878, Steinway began producing their new small Models 'A' and 'B' with laminated maple cabinets, creating the modern \\"rim\\" case: Very long, thin (3.5 mm) planks of maple were slathered with hide glue, bent around a form, clamped together and allowed to dry. This process made rim fabrication quicker, and the resultant structure stronger and more stable. It also was cheaper, requiring fewer man-hours and being less wasteful of hardwoods that need several years of storage and precise seasoning. This speedier production method was of great advantage in a time of huge demand for good pianos. In 1880, the two big grand models 'C' and 'D' were changed accordingly. The old 'Henry'-designed (father & son) C grand (formerly named 'Parlor Grand') also got a covered pinblock and a 'rim' (still with 85 keys), and the concert grand Model 'D' which had made a great success on the Centennial Exhibition 1876 in Philadelphia also got a 'rim' case. There are nearly no two identical grands of the 424 Centennial D-270 once built. One will find at nearly every grand tiny modifications. So one can regard the concert grand Centennial D-270 (1875‚Äì1884) as a transient model for continuous improvement. Of the known still existing Centennial grands, there is ca. a 2/3 portion with 'constructed case' and a 1/3 portion with 'rim'.Private investigations, author of this information is hunting Centennial D information since 2010. After the concert success of an 1883 prototype 'D' that featured a laminated case, radically higher string tension and capo bar (which began at note 36 yet retained vestigial agraffes all the way to note 88), Steinway unveiled the 1884 'D', a fully realized new model with a redesigned scale (including a 20-note instead of a 17-note bass), a capo bar in both upper treble sections, a newly designed pedal lyre, and a multi-laminated case.James Barron: Piano - The Making of a Steinway Concert Grand. Times Books, New York 2006, . In subsequent years few changes occurred, though the instrument's length increased slightly (the \\"rim type\\" D concert grand pianos from 1884 to about 1895 were only 272 cm long). However, in 1936 a soundboard based on a patent of Paul Bilhuber, an \\"in-law\\" member of the Steinway family, was introduced. Bilhuber had created a soundboard that tapered evenly from the thickest central point to a thinner perimeter, and it was judged to provide greater response and longevity. Not all Steinway innovations were successful. In 1961, Teflon bushings for the playing mechanism were incorporated into U.S.-built grand pianos ‚Äì a modification that the piano makers at the Hamburg branch did not adopt despite much pressure from the New York-based company. They were able to resist only because the profits of the Hamburg plant were greater than those of the New York factory. The Teflon bushings were intended to lessen friction problems that might occur because of seasonal humidity changes, but they themselves caused excessive friction. Further, because they were a hard and dimensionally stable substance (fixed into wood, which is not), at certain times of the year they would loosen in their holes and cause clicking during play. After years of complaints from pianists and technicians, in 1982 the New York makers re- introduced the classic felt bushings with an infused dry-grease fluid made with Teflon particles that allowed them to keep using the word Teflon in their advertising.Susan Goldenberg: Steinway - From Glory to Controversy - The Family - The Business - The Piano. Mosaic Press, Oakville (Ontario, CDN) 1996, . The Steinway Model 'D' represents about 5 percent of all Steinway grand pianos produced, a significantly larger share of concert-grand output than the 1-2 percent that other manufacturers produce. An explanation is found not only in their exceptional quality but in their sophisticated marketing programs ‚Äì the Steinway Artists program and the concert grand piano banks in New York City, London, and Hamburg have virtually guaranteed the loyalty of concert artists worldwide. On U.S. stages, more than 90 percent of performances using a concert grand use a Steinway 'D'. Of the approximately 600,000 pianos Steinway has built (as of 2010), about 25,000 are Models 'D'. Only 424 of the predecessor \\"Centennial D\\" pianos were built; about 30 are still known to exist.Website of the piano technician Bill Shull, Los Angeles  Artists' preference ‚Äì geographic origin and specific instruments  Stephen Beus performs on a D-274 in the 2006 Gina Bachauer International Piano Competition Steinway manufactures the 'D' in two factories, one in New York and one in Hamburg, Germany. Outwardly, New York and Hamburg 'D's differ most noticeably in finish, with the former displaying traditional satin lacquer and the latter high-gloss polyester.Allen, Frederick, \\"Steinway: Where high tech does only the simplest jobs,\\" American Heritage, Fall 1993 (accessed March 22, 2010) Differences in the respective instruments' tone and playing character, however, have led particular pianists to gravitate to the output of one factory or the other; Vladimir Horowitz, for instance, preferred a New York 'D', whereas Marc-Andre Hamelin, Alfred Brendel, Mitsuko Uchida, Burkard Schliessmann, Grigory Sokolov, Arcadi Volodos, Artur Rubinstein and Krystian Zimerman were partial to the Hamburg product. Garrick Ohlsson preferred the brilliance of the Hamburg instrument in his youth, but the warmth of the New York 'D' as he matured. Sergei Rachmaninoff bought three 'D's, all New York products, for his homes in the United States, but he installed a Hamburg 'D' in his Swiss villa. The difference between the New York and Hamburg Steinway pianos is less noticeable today. Pianist and Steinway Artist Emanuel Ax says that \\"... the differences have more to do with individual instruments than with where they were made.\\"\\"Steinways with German Accents...\\", The New York Times, August 27, 2003.

He retained technician Verne Edquist to restore and maintain the instrument and had it shipped to any auditorium in which he was to play. The piano sustained a cracked plate during such a shipment in 1971, when Gould had scheduled a recording session with the Cleveland orchestra; for years thereafter, Edquist attempted to repair the damage, and his inability to do so was a source of distress to Gould.Bethune, Brian, \\"Glenn Gould's Steinway,\\" The Encyclopedia of Music in Canada, reprinted from Maclean's of June 23, 2008 (accessed November 27, 2013) The CD 318-C still exists in its damaged state, preserved at Library and Archives Canada in Ottawa, which also houses the Glenn Gould Archive.Bazzana, Kevin, Geoffrey Payzant, and John Beckwith, \\"Gould, Glenn,\\" The Encyclopedia of Music in Canada (accessed November 27, 2013) *To circumvent company policy that would have compelled her to record on a smaller instrument, Olga Samaroff purchased a 'D' on which to make her recordings for Victor late in the acoustic era.

Such pianos are given \\"CD\\" designators, and they receive replacement stencils calculated for greater visibility at a distance. A pianist visiting one of these banks may sample and choose from a range of D-274s, according to taste, for public performance or recording; Steinway prepares and transports the chosen instrument, although the artist bears the cost of these services. As noted above, some artists have developed affinities for particular instruments included in this program; the requirement that instruments so supplied be credited to Steinway led to Olga Samaroff's above-mentioned purchase of a D-274 on which to make records.  Popular accounts of manufacture  At least three independent accounts have detailed the process by which Steinway manufactures the D-274. In 1982, Michael Lenehan published an article in Atlantic Monthly in which he followed the construction of a D-274, designated as K 2571 during manufacture and later, after its adoption into the piano bank program, as CD-129. A somewhat revised version of the article posted to the Internet includes information updated in 1997. The original article, dating to approximately the time of the company's sale to CBS, described many practices held over from the 19th century, mostly personalized by focusing on individual employees tasked with performing them, but it also touched on what then were prospective changes under consideration to modernize certain aspects of production. The 1997 update continues that approach, updating the various personal stories but also detailing the company's subsequent ownership history and adoption of selected new production methods. In 2003, The New York Times ran a series of articles, ultimately published in book form,Barron, James, Piano: The Making of a Steinway Concert Grand, New York: Times Books, 2006 () following the construction of a D-274 designated K 0862. In 2007, an independent documentary film entitled Note by Note: The Making of Steinway L1037 followed the construction of a D-274 for more than a year, from the search for wood in Alaska to display of the finished instrument at Manhattan's Steinway Hall.

His name has led to a possible identification with a similarly named son of Germanus (d. 550) and Matasuntha.Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), p. 528 But said son has also been identified with Germanus, a son-in-law of Tiberius II Constantine and Ino Anastasia.Whitby (1988), p. 7 The common name \\"Germanus\\" may hint to these figures being related to each other but there is insufficient evidence for identifications. Under Maurice In November 601 or more likely, in February 602, an unnamed daughter of Germanus married Theodosius, the eldest son of Maurice and Constantina. The marriage was recorded by Theophylact Simocatta, Theophanes the Confessor, the Chronicon Paschale, Joannes Zonaras and Georgios Kedrenos.Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), pp. 531‚Äì532, 1293 On 2 February 602, Theophylact records Germanus rescuing the life of Theodosius from a rioting mob in Constantinople, angry over a food shortage. Later that year, Germanus and Theodosius went hunting to Callicrateia, a brief distance from Constantinople. There they received correspondence from the rebellious army of Thrace. The rebels demanded the deposition of Maurice and offered their support to elevate either Theodosius or Germanus to the throne. Germanus was soon accused of treason by Maurice. The emperor suspected him of being responsible for the ongoing revolt. Besides the incriminating letter, there was another act pointing to the rebels being allied to Germanus. They were reportedly seizing all horses outside Constantinople, but had left Germanus' horses alone. Germanus pleaded for his innocence in vain. Theodosius convinced his father-in-law to flee before facing the wrath of Maurice. Germanus and his bodyguard sought sanctuary, first in the church to the Theotokos created by Cyrus of Panopolis, then in the Hagia Sophia. Maurice send his own guards to capture Germanus and turmoil followed. Germanus considered surrendering but a crowd sympathetic to him convinced him otherwise. They were convinced that Maurice was intending to execute Germanus. Under Phocas In late November, 602, Maurice fled Constantinople to escape the advancing rebels. Germanus took his chance to claim the throne. He counted on the support of the Green faction in the Hippodrome of Constantinople. He had miscalculated as the Greens firmly rejected him. The would-be-emperor immediately turned to support Phocas, the leader of the rebels. According to Theophylact, Phocas had briefly considered elevating Germanus to the throne, but instead seized the throne for himself. A rumor of the time suggested that Germanus had managed to save the life of Theodosius by bribing Phocas' men. Theophylact dismisses any truth to the rumor. In any case, Phocas did not trust Germanus. The Chronicon mentions Germanus becoming a priest in 603. Theophanes considers this to be a direct decision by Phocas, who had discovered Germanus conspiring against him. If Phocas believed that he was finished with Germanus, he was wrong. Theophanes records that Constantina maintained contact with Germanus and that both were conspiring against Phocas. Their messages were entrusted to Petronia, a maidservant under Constantina. Petronia proved disloyal and reported the conspiracy to Phocas. Constantina was arrested and placed in the custody of Theopemptus, prefect of Constantinople. Her interrogation included torture and she was forced to give the name of her fellow conspirators.Lynda Garland, \\"Constantina, Wife of Maurice\\" Constantina and all three of her daughters were executed at Chalcedon. Germanus and his unnamed daughter were also executed on the island of Prote. The daughter had been the widow of Theodosius. Theophanes places the deaths in 605/606 but the exact date is in doubt.Lynda Garland, \\"Constantina, Wife of Maurice\\" The Chronicon Paschale reports that all six were decapitated.

If the real exchange rate varies considerably, but the price elasticities of demand for imports and exports are low, the long run growth of the economy will then be determined by the growth of world income times the ratio of the income elasticity of demand for exports and imports which are determined by the structural characteristics of countries. One important example of this is that if developing countries produce mainly primary products and low value manufactured goods with a low income elasticity of demand, while developed countries specialise in high income elasticity manufactured goods the developing countries will grow at a relatively slower rate (Davidson, 1991). Thirlwall‚Äôs balance of payments constrained growth model ‚Äìor Thirlwall‚Äôs Law- is often called the dynamic Harrod trade multiplier result following Roy Harrod‚Äôs (1933) static foreign trade multiplier result that Y = X/m, where Y is national income; X is exports and m is the marginal propensity to import, which is derived under the same assumptions as Thirlwall‚Äôs Law (O‚ÄôHara, 1999). The assumption of balance of payments equilibrium on current account can be relaxed to allow capital flows (see Thirlwall and Nureldin Hussein, 1982), but for reasonable values of sustainable flows (e.g. 3% of GDP), capital flows make little empirical difference to the growth predictions of the basic model. Since 1979, the model has been extensively tested (for surveys of the literature see McCombie and Thirlwall 1994, 2004) with broad support for both developed and developing countries. See also \\"PSL Quarterly Review Vol. 64 No.259 (2011)\\" and \\"Models of Balance of Payments Constrained Growth: History, Theory and Evidence (2012)\\" The model provides an alternative to the supply side models of neo-classical growth theory which are close economy models with no demand constraints. In the Thirlwall model the ultimate constraint on growth is a shortage of foreign exchange or the growth of exports to which factor supplies can adapt. It is changes in growth that equilibrate the balance of payments, not changes in relative prices in international trade.

In Belfast Town, 1864-1880: Early Photographs from the Lawrence Collection. Belfast: Friar's Bush Press. It is situated opposite Queen's University Belfast. History Elmwood Hall was built originally as the Elmwood Presbyterian Church. It was designed in 1859 by amateur architect John Corry, but not actually erected until 1862. The pulpit and other internal furnishings were removed, along with the stained glass windows.Larmour, Paul (1987). Belfast: An Illustrated Architectural Guide. Belfast: Friar's Bush Press. The stonework was restored and the golden weathercock added by HA Patton & Partners in 1975. The polished granite pillars round the front courtyard had lost some of their elaborately carved sandstone capitals, but these were restored in 2000. Queen's University Belfast converted the church into a concert hall and renamed it Elmwood Hall. The building was deconsecrated and for a time became the home of the Ulster Orchestra. Following the closure of the Queen's University Student Union for redevelopment, the Mandela Hall team will be relocating many of their live concerts, comedies and student events to the Elmwood Hall until Mandela Hall re-opens in 2021-2022 within the new Student Centre. Architecture The building has a mixture of styles, principally Italianate with a spire on top of a campanile. It has been described as one of Ulster's best High Victorian church designs ‚Äì a triumph of eclecticism, where the combination of apparently discordant elements such as a Renaissance arcade with chunky Venetian columns, mediaeval machicolations, a classical cornice and balustrade, a Moorish well canopy and a French needle spire are absorbed into a coherent but very elaborate Irish version of a Lombard Gothic church (Irish Builder). Behind the polychrome freestone fa√ßade, the interior is surprisingly large, having a great width uninterrupted by roof supports, and a deep gallery running back over both vestibule and loggia, reached by a winding staircase beneath the tower (which, while part of the 1859 design, was added in 1872).

In 1989 Israel recognized him as among the Righteous Among the Nations and listed his name at Yad Vashem. Turkish and Greek Jews were deported to death camps from the island of Corfu. But on the island of Rhodes, Turkey‚Äôs Consul, Selahattin √úlk√ºmen, saved the lives of close to 50 people, among a Jewish community of some 2,000 after the Germans took over the island. The German occupation followed Italy's removal of Benito Mussolini from power and its armistice with the Allies. Background Jews had prospered on Rhodes during 390 years of Ottoman occupation (which ended in 1912 when Italy occupied Rhodes and the other Dodecanese islands). The Germans took over in September 1943 after Italy withdrew from the war. By the 1940s, the ethnic Jewish community numbered about 2,000, made up of people from Turkey, Greece, Italy and other Mediterranean countries, as well as those native to the island. √úlk√ºmen's interventions On 19 July 1944, the Gestapo ordered all of the island‚Äôs Jewish population to gather at its headquarters: ostensibly they were to register for \\"temporary transportation to a small island nearby\\", but in reality they were gathered for transport to Auschwitz and its gas chambers. √úlk√ºmen went to the German commanding officer, General Ulrich Kleemann, to remind him that Turkey was neutral in World War II. He asked for release of the Jews, including not only Turkish citizens but also their spouses and relatives, even though many of the latter were Italian and Greek citizens. At first the commander refused, stating that under Nazi law, all Jews were considered Jews foremost and had to go to the concentration camps. √úlk√ºmen responded with \\"under Turkish law all citizens were equal. We didn‚Äôt differentiate between citizens who were Jewish, Christian or Muslim.\\"Stanford J. Shaw, Turkey and the Holocaust: Turkey's Role in Rescuing Turkish and European Jewry from Nazi Persecution, 1933-1945, New York: New York University Press; London, MacMillan Press, 1993 √úlk√ºmen told Kleeman that \\"I would advise my Government if he didn‚Äôt release the Jewish Turks it would cause an international incident. Then he agreed.\\" The Jews protected by √úlk√ºmen were released, though not until they were subjected to considerable additional harassment by the Nazi authorities. √úlk√ºmen continued to provide protection and moral support to those whom he had rescued and other Jews who remained on the island. They feared suffering deportation, as they were required to report to the Gestapo daily and never knew whether or not they would be able to return home. Soon after √úlk√ºmen's gaining release of Turkish Jews, the Germans rounded up the other Jews on Rhodes, numbering 1,673 in all, and deported them to Greece. From there, the Germans had them transported to extermination camps; only 151 of the group survived the war. Nazi retaliation In retaliation German planes bombed the Turkish consulate on Rhodes. Killed in the bombing were √úlk√ºmen‚Äôs wife Mihrinissa √úlk√ºmen, leaving behind their newborn son Mehmet, as well as two consular employees. The Germans quickly detained and deported √úlk√ºmen to Piraeus on mainland Greece and confined him there for the remainder of the war. During the next six months, Jewish Turks remaining on Rhodes were subjected to almost constant harassment by the Gestapo, which often detained them for long periods of time. It did not deport them to concentration camps as earlier planned, presumably because of the disorder and other requirements for transport in the Third Reich during the last days of the war. Finally, early in January 1945, the German commander Kleeman learned that representatives of the International Red Cross were to visit Rhodes to look into the situation of its population. He ordered the remaining Jews on the island to go to Turkey, which they did the next day, traveling in small boats across a stormy sea to safety at the port of Marmaris. After the war Released at the end of the war, √úlk√ºmen returned to Turkey. He died in his sleep on 7 June 2003 in Istanbul, Turkey at the age of 89. Legacy and honors Maurice Soriano, the head of the 35-person Jewish community who remained in Rhodes after the war, recently stated, \\"I am indebted to the Turkish consul who made extraordinary efforts to save my life and those of my fellow countrymen.\\" *Quincentennial Foundation Vice President, historian Naim Guleryuz, collected testimony from living survivors and applied to Israel for recognition of √úlk√ºmen‚Äôs actions during the war. On 13 December 1989, the Yad Vashem Foundation of Israel declared √úlk√ºmen one of the Righteous Among the Nations.

The Early Wesco years  Born in California in 1928, he started his career in the Navy, and went to college, but found college difficult and did not graduate. He opened his own machine shop called Wesco Tool, where he experienced great success making airplane parts. In the late 1950s Butler started sailing dinghies, and as his family grew he desired a bigger boat. He set his eyes on the 21‚Äô Victory Sloop, designed by Naval Architect Ted Carpenter and first launched in 1959. He contracted with the boat builder to make him one, but the builder ran out of funds. Butler gave the builder a loan. Unable to repay the debt, the builder gave Butler the tooling to continue building the boat himself. In 1962 after 126 Victory 21 boats were manufactured, the rights for the Victory 21 were sold to Frank Butler who founded a second company he named Wesco Marine.  The Coronado years  A short while after producing boats under the name of Wesco Marine, Butler changed the name of Wesco Marine to Coronado Yachts. Among the first boats built by Coronado were the Victory 21 and the 14‚Äô Super Satellite. The first notable boat design by Butler was the Coronado 25, which incorporated his knowledge from his work in the airplane industry. In 1968 Butler sold Coronado to the Whittaker Corporation, which had divisions in aerospace, metal, chemical, and healthcare, and had already purchased Columbia Yachts from Dick Valdes in 1967. Whittaker had also acquired several power boat manufacturers. Butler worked for Whitaker for one year, and then left due to disagreements with management over the production of a trailerable boat with a movable keel. Dick Valdes left Whittaker in 1972, and eventually many of the Columbia models became cross-branded with Coronados. In 1974 Whitaker discontinued the Coronado line.  The Catalina years  Butler had a non- competition contract with Whittaker for two years, so his boat building was limited to the smaller ones for which Whittaker hadn't bought the rights. Butler built a marina in Oxnard, Calif, and founded Catalina Yachts. His first new product was the trailerable Catalina with a movable keel, and he continued to build the smaller boats, such as the Coronado 15, the Omega, the Super Satellite, and the Drifter. Butler‚Äôs employee and right-hand man, Beattie says, \\"We wanted to change the name of the Coronado 15 to make it obvious the boat wasn't built by Coronado Yachts, but couldn't because the class association wouldn't let us.‚Äù Shortly after its founding, Catalina Yachts acquired the manufacturing rights to the Victory 21, and later resumed its production selling the Victory as a Capri Victory 21. By 1977 Butler had designed and produced three more models: the Catalina 25, Catalina 27, and the Catalina 30. In 1978 Catalina developed the Catalina 38 based on molds for a Sparkman & Stephens racing design purchased from the bankrupt Yankee Yacht Company. Butler redesigned the interior and gave it a \\"Catalina deck\\", taller mast, shorter boom, and moved the rudder.  The Capri, Morgan, Prindle, Islander, and Pearson years  The Capri line of sailboats, developed under the Capri Sailboat Division, are the performance-oriented daysailers of Catalina. The Capri models range from 8 to . In 1984 Catalina expanded their manufacturing capabilities by acquiring Morgan Yachts, of which Catalina continues to use the brand name for the Catalina Morgan 440 introduced in 2004. The other lines produced by Catalina are the Nacra and Prindle catamarans, and the Islander 34- a powerboat made from a mold purchased from Pearson when it went out of business. Most recently, Catalina acquired the tooling and rights to build the True North line of traditional, Downeast-style power boats. The redesigned True North 34 was introduced at the Miami International Boat Show in February 2020. Wesco Marine is currently held as a separate entity which provides rigging hardware to Catalina Yachts.  Butler and Catalina today  Catalina Yachts is one of the largest boat manufacturers in the world, with over 60,000 boats manufactured to date, more than 120 employees, and about of manufacturing space. Catalina produces its boats in its Florida manufacturing facility. In 1998 Gerry Douglas, Vice President and the company's longtime chief designer & marine engineer, was named a partner in this privately owned company. Frank Butler, in his 90s, is no longer involved in day-to-day activities, but checks in regularly from his California home.

Early life and training The only daughter of Melbourne homeopath James Teague and his wife Eliza Jane Miller, Teague was born on 21 February 1872 in Melbourne. Her mother died while she was an infant, and she was raised by her father and his second wife, Sybella, along with Sybella's two children. Teague was taught by a governess at home, and her education included French and the classics. She completed college at the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Melbourne. Teague travelled with her family in Europe as a young woman. She toured widely, and visited galleries in Germany, France, Belgium the Netherlands and England. In 1901, she recalled visiting Spanish galleries during her childhood, and commented \\"never shall I forget the Velazquez, with their beautiful horses and exquisite colouring, or the lovely Raphaels\\". She studied in the Brussels studio of Ernest Blanc-Garin and with Sir Hubert von Herkomer in England. Career Teague exhibited regularly at the Paris Salons, including with a portrait of a Colonel Rede in 1897 at the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Fran√ßais. In 1902 she was appointed to the council of the Victorian Artists Society which published her poem 'A Cloud Fantasy' in its journal. She was \\"the first Australian to demonstrate a sustained interest in, and an understanding of Japanese woodblock printmaking\\". Printing from woodblock had a long history in Japan. She collaborated in woodcuts with her friend Geraldine Rede, publishing Night Fall in the Ti-Tree together from her Collins Street studio in 1905. The 32 page Haiku-style text tells the story of the simple life of bushland rabbits with 16 coloured woodblock illustrations. This collaborative little book is the first example of coloured woodblock printing in Australia, and also the first Australian artists' book. Her painting Boy with a Palette won a silver prize from the Old Salon, Paris when exhibited in 1920, and was later hung at the Royal Academy of Arts, London. Following the 1920 Paris Salon, Australian artist Rupert Bunny wrote to Teague, and observed that The Boy with the Pallette was one of the best works in that year's exhibition at the Old Salon. A page from Night fall in the Ti-Tree One of the most unusual aspects of Teague's oeuvre, one that lacks almost any referents in Australian art, was the creation of altar paintings and banners for Protestant churches. The first was a 1910 commission (now in the Hamilton art gallery) for a church in Wannon, Victoria, where her brother worshipped. The frame for the work was designed by her friend, artist Jessie Traill. In 1921, Teague exhibited an altar piece (now at St. Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne) for a new church at Kinglake, Victoria, built as a memorial to soldiers who died in World War I. Inscriptions to accompany the picture were again prepared by Traill, and placed on the base of the work. The painting was Teague's most prominent work at a solo exhibition held at the Melbourne Athenaeum in 1921. Paintings for Mt Eliza church, [19 Nov, 1931, p. 4], Frankston and Somerville Standard In 1933 Teague and her sister Una travelled across the outback by car to visit the Hermannsburg Mission. The Mission had recently suffered a drought resulting in the deaths of a third of the Aboriginal population. The sisters helped raise more than ¬£2,000 towards a pipeline to help transport water to the Mission. She also met famed Aboriginal artist Albert Namatjira, who named one of his children after her.

The Mantis did not enter full production, however, several prototype Mantis Flyers were successfully deployed in counter smuggling operations along the Israel-Egypt border and tested by special forces. In 2004, the Malaysia government military company DEFTECH formed a partnership with Flyer Defense LLC to market the Flyer Advance Light Strike Vehicle (ALSV) GEN II (variant ITV-1) in the region, after ST Kinetics had commenced developing their own vehicle, the partnership continues today. In 2008, the Indian government military company Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) produced a Flyer ITV-1 prototype with Flyer Defense LLC for the Indian Army Light Support Vehicle (LSV) contract. The vehicle did not enter production. Production In May 1996, Singapore placed an order with HSMV Corporation for 29 Flyer vehicles to be produced under licence in Australia by Australian Defence Industries (ADI) - an Australian government company ‚Äì which were delivered in April 1998. The Flyer replaced Singapore Army jeeps armed with 106mm recoilless guns. Indonesia placed a large order for Flyer vehicles, however, only 5 Australian produced vehicles were delivered. In March 1998, Singapore placed a second order with HSMV Corporation for 50 Flyer vehicles to be produced under licence by ADI. In October 1998, Singapore Technologies Kinetics (ST Kinetics) - (formerly Singapore Technologies Automotive, which is now known as Singapore Technologies Engineering) - was granted a licence to produce the Flyer for HSMV Corporation and commenced production. The production of Flyer vehicles by ADI ceased. The second order started delivery in May 2000. Armament A typical weapon installation could be a 7.62mm machine gun forward plus a pedestal mount for a missile launcher or a 40 mm automatic grenade launcher such as the 40AGL. The STK 50 heavy machine gun can also be mounted. Some vehicles in service with the Singapore Army carry a rear-mounted pedestal for two Spike anti-tank guided weapons (ATGW), with stowage for five missiles. Others have been seen with a combined 40 mm AGL and 7.62 mm machine gun mounting supplemented by a pintle-mounted 7.62 mm machine gun, while others have been seen mounting the MILAN ATGW. Operators *: Kopassus purchased 5 Australian produced vehicles. *: Singapore Army Guards initially purchased 29 Australian produced vehicles received in 1998 followed by 50 Singapore produced vehicles received in May 2000 R-12D Flyer 1 *: Hellenic Army special forces purchased 3 vehicles received in February 2003 ITV-1 *:Israel Defense Forces used prototype RAFEAL Mantis on Israel-Egypt border operations Unknown variant *: US special forces reportedly used the Flyer, unknown numbers and unknown variant either R-12D Flyer 1 or Flyer 21 / ITV-1 Light Strike Vehicle Mark II The primary role of the LSV MK. II is against armoured threats. It is designed to be helicopter portable and manoeuvrable over cross- country terrain. The vehicle is equipped with enhanced networking capabilities to support the integration with other combat systems during operations. Design The LSV MK. II is produced by Singapore Technologies Kinetics Ltd (ST Kinetics) as the Spider New Generation Light Strike Vehicle (Spider New Gen). In September 2011, ST Kinetics won a $68 million contract to supply its Spider New Gen and spares to the Singapore Army. The first MK. II was delivered in November 2013 concluding in 2014. ST Kinetics had designed a previous prototype vehicle to replace the Singapore Army Light Strike Vehicle named the Spider. At the Asian Aerospace 2004 in Singapore, ST Kinetics unveiled the Spider a redesigned Light Strike Vehicle that did not enter production. The LSV MK. II bears several enhancements vis-a-vis the LSV that it replaces. It has a more powerful engine, an improved suspension system and a better designed space frame with a higher payload. The new vehicle also has a larger seating capacity and supports an array of communication systems that enhances its networking capabilities with other combat systems in the battlefield. These enhancements allow the LSV MK. II to be more agile and deployable than its predecessor. It is capable of climbing and traversing 60% inclines and climbing slopes up to 50%. The driver was relocated from right hand drive to the front centre seat of the vehicle. This unique center-hand drive enables flexible weapon configurations on both sides of the driver position for a wide arc of fire. Due to its lightweight design, the vehicle can be carried underslung by medium-lift helicopters such as CH-47 Chinook or stacked during airlift for rapid deployment by the C-130 Hercules. The LSV MK. II is equipped with the Mantis system. At the Eurosatory 2004 in Paris, Israeli company Rafael Armament Development Authority unveiled the Mantis system fitted to a Light Strike Vehicle (Flyer ITV-1). The Mantis is based on advanced Israeli systems RAFAEL Spike LR ATGM, RAFAEL C4I Tactical System - a rugged laptop which is the center of the Mantis system, ESC BAZ retractable Multi-Sensor for surveillance and reconnaissance - includes a day camera, night (thermal) camera and a laser rangefinder and Azimuth Comet - provides target acquisition data such as coordinates to the targets. Capabilities The LSV MK. II is produced in three variants: the Automatic Grenade Launcher (AGL) variant that operates the 40mm AGL system; the Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) variant that operates the Spike missile system; and the Utility variant for general purpose usage.

Styles North-Western Italian architecture is usually quite big and bulky, contrasted to the Renaissance and medieval cityscapes in Central Italy, Venetian-style villas and towns in North-Eastern Italy, and cluttered Spanish-style architecture in Southern Italy. Buildings in North- Western Italy are often built with solid bricks, due to the harsh climate in this area. North-Western Italy is not usually identifiable by a particular style: the Aosta Valley and Piedmont tend to be more French in essence, Lombardy is a mixture of Central Italian (Emilia-Romagna and Tuscany), French, Spanish and Austrian styles, whilst Liguria is highly unusual, with its brightly painted houses. The area is full of medieval castles, including some very notable early ones in the Aosta Valley and Piedmont, and Renaissance ones in Lombardy. The North-West is also the hub of modern and contemporary Italian architecture; Milan, Turin and Genoa were and still are the capitals of Italian modernist and industrial design, and such examples can be seen in buildings such as the Torre Velasca and the Pirelli Tower in Milan, Lingotto building in Turin and the \\"Biscione\\" neighborhood in Genoa.Eyewitness Travel (2005), pg. 26 - 27 Regions=Aosta Valley Being a mountainous and very small region, the Aosta Valley's contribution to Italian architecture remains relatively small in comparison to some of the bigger regions, but is noted for its bulky and beautiful stone medieval castles, churches and buildings in general. Aostan architecture also remains highly French in essence, especially in the cities of Aosta and La Thuile. As a popular ski resort, the region is famous for its wooden chalets. Piedmont The Royal Palace of Turin Piedmont's architecture varies very much. The mountainous areas remain similar to those of the Aosta Valley, the central area is a similar to that of Lombardy, the western area and Turin are very French in style, whilst the Southern part is similar to the architecture of Liguria. However, Piedmont is known for its grand country houses and palaces, such as the Palazzina di caccia di Stupinigi, in Stupinigi and just outside Turin, or the Residences of the Royal House of Savoy which ended up being declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Turin's architecture is grandiose, and mixes elements of Baroque, Rococo and Neoclassicism together. As one of the most important industrial regions in Italy, Piedmont is also renowned for its world-class modern-design architecture, such as the Lingotto, for a period one of the biggest and most technologically advanced factories in Europe, or the region's 1930s mountain hotels. Lombardy Piazza del Duomo, Milan Lombardy's architecture also remains eclectic and unique. The southern part takes inspiration from the Renaissance architecture of Emilia-Romagna, however the northern part is in essence very Austrian and French. Lombardy is known for its beautiful medieval and Renaissance cities, such as Mantua, Bergamo, Pavia and Cremona, with monuments such as the Certosa di Pavia, and for its unique Gothic architecture (known as Lombard Gothic), clearly seen in the impressive Milan Cathedral. Lombardy is also home to Italy's industrial architecture, including Italy's first building in glass, steel and iron, the glamorous shopping gallery Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan, the impressive 19th century industrial estates at Crespi d'Adda, which have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and innovative modern architecture seen in the Torre Velasca and Pirelli Tower in Milan. Liguria Liguria probably has the most unusual architectural elements of all the North-Western Italian regions. It is famous for its brightly coloured small houses on the coast, which often have very beautiful and intricate designs. Baroque architecture is also common in Liguria, found in many of the region's cities. However, modern architecture has taken the region as well, with world-famous Ligurian architects such as Renzo Piano constructing innovative structures in Genoa, along with Genoa's big aquarium and the modernist mast structure in the old port of Genoa. Natable examples The medieval F√©nis Castle F√©nis Castle F√©nis Castle is highly unusual and one of the Aosta Valley's finest and best examples of medieval 14th-century architecture. It is asymmetrical, and features bastions, bulky stone walls, towers and turrets, and beautiful early-middle age frescoes inside.Eyewitness Travel (2005), pg. 26 - 27 Monza Cathedral The Monza Cathedral, built in the late 14th century, has a unique Renaissance style making it one of the most beautiful in the region. Milan Cathedral Probably the finest example of Italian Gothic architecture is the huge Milan Cathedral is famous for its medieval spires, impressive facade, grand bronze-doors, and the Madonnina golden statue at the top, which dominates the Milan skyline. Palazzo della Loggia The Palazzo della Loggia in Brescia is a Renaissance palace with strong Venetian influences. It was completed in 1574, after numerous interventions by the most famous architects of the time, including Jacopo Sansovino, Andrea Palladio, Luigi Vanvitelli and Lodovico Beretta, who completed the building. Cappella Colleoni in Bergamo Cappella Coleoni The Cappella Colleoni in Bergamo, built in 1476, has an octagonal dome, similar to that of Florence Cathedral, and a fine marble facade. Palazzo Carignano (Museo del Risorgimento) The Palazzo Carignano is one of the grandest Baroque palaces in Turin, and has two different facades: one Baroque and the other Neoclassical. Built by Guarino Guarini in 1679, it has a beautiful brink rotunda-like facade. Palazzina di caccia of Stupinigi Palazzina di caccia of Stupinigi is a Rococo hunting lodge is the arguably the best example of Rococo architecture in the country, and features an impressive facade, lavish interior, and spacious, leafy gardens and background park.Eyewitness Travel (2005), pg. 26 - 27 Mole Antonelliana This building, constructed from 1863 until 1897, was meant to be a synagogue in Turin, however with a spire reaching 167 metres, it was for a period in time the world's tallest building.Eyewitness Travel (2005), pg. 26 - 27 The Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II This revolutionary gallery was one of the oldest in the world, and the first building to use iron, glass and steel in Italy, built by Menegoni in 1865 and dedicated to King Vittorio Emanuele II.Eyewitness Travel (2005), pg. 26 - 27 Lingotto The Lingotto is one of the most impressive examples of factory architecture in Italy.

Created in 1980, The Wild Animal Sanctuary is situated on grassland northeast of Denver, and has helped over 1,000 animals since it first opened. By early 2018, home to more than 460 animals, the group announced the purchase of a major addition, a 9,004-acre ranch near Springfield, Colorado. Mission The stated mission of the sanctuary is \\"to rescue captive large carnivores who have been abused, abandoned, illegally kept or exploited; to create for them a wonderful life for as long as they live; and to educate about the causes and solutions to the Captive Wildlife Crisis.\\" The sanctuary states that there are many large carnivores living outside the zoo system in the United States, including 4000 or so tigers living as pets in Texas alone, and many of these come from the black market trade in exotic animals. History Timberwolves as seen from the walkway Pat Craig started The Wild Animal Sanctuary when he took in a Jaguar cub that he kept on a licensed facility on his family's farm outside Boulder, Colorado. The animals were soon moved to Lyons, Colorado to provide additional space. After 8 years in Lyons, a limestone quarry was opened nearby, forcing the sanctuary to move. In 2005, largely because of relief efforts for Hurricane Katrina and the Indonesia tsunami, donations to the sanctuary decreased significantly, and by mid-2006 the staff thought the sanctuary would need to close. In order to help raise money, the sanctuary was opened to the public, started selling donated merchandise, brought in more volunteers, and started a program of sponsoring individual animals. By 2007 the sanctuary was using of its site for rescued animal habitats. By 2010 it had of habitats. In February 2011, the sanctuary, in cooperation with Animal Defenders International, Bob Barker, and the Bolivian government (which had recently enacted legislation outlawing performing wild animals), received 25 lions from circuses in Bolivia that had typically housed the lions in crates for transport. The sanctuary built a fabric covered structure isolated from the main facility to house the lions while they got acclimated to the Colorado climate, and while four outdoor enclosures were being prepared. The first of the prides, picked because they \\"appear to be close-knit and familiar with each other\\", was first allowed access to their large outdoor habitat on April 14, 2011. The additional of enclosures created for the Bolivian lions took up the remainder of the existing sanctuary property, but later in 2011, a donation allowed the sanctuary to purchase another , expanding the site to and providing space for future expansion of the habitats. In May 2012 the sanctuary completed the \\"Mile Into the Wild\\" walkway. This walkway has let visitors view and photograph the animals in their large habitat areas from above, and at the time connected the original holding area and education building with the Bolivian Lion House and a new parking lot that was built for the increasing number of visitors. In addition, the county paved the road to the sanctuary, making access easier. Mile Into the Wild walkway approaching the Bolivian Lion House Facilities Bear enclosure with shade structures, water tank, and \\"dens\\" in the foreground Water feature under construction in 2012 The sanctuary aims to eventually get all of their animals into large acreage habitats. It designed with a central compound for receiving new animals and starting their recuperation and acclimation into these larger habitats. The lower floor of the main compound houses tigers, and the upper floor is an education center. The animals in this area have indoor/outdoor enclosures with play structures, and heated areas for the winter. The common pool area where tigers can take turns playing includes a waterfall. As of 2013, the sanctuary had 26 large , species specific habitats that are home to over 330 African lions, tigers, bears, leopards, cougars, timberwolves and other large carnivores. Habitats include pools for swimming and underground dens that stay at a constant temperature year round. Visitors can view these animals in their natural habitats from elevated walkways accessed from the education center. In the summer of 2016 a new 48,000 square foot welcome center was opened and an additional 1/2-mile of elevated walkway was added.Fall 2016 Newsletter p. 42 On October 31, 2016, Guinness World Records certified that the Wild Animal Sanctuary's elevated walkway was the world's longest footbridge at 1.51 miles (7,974 feet, 2,430 meters), supplanting the Poughkeepsie Railroad Bridge. In spring 2018, with the Keenesburg site deemed at capacity, and no local expansion options, partly due to expanding oil and gas operations, the sanctuary announced the purchase of an additional property of 9,004 acres in the southeastern part of the state. The new $7M property, dubbed \\"The Wildlife Refuge\\", is between the towns of La Junta and Springfield, mainly in Baca County, the rest in Las Animas County. In contrast to the plains of Keenesburg, the new location has a variety of wild terrain, including pine forest, canyons, caves and rocky areas. The sanctuary expects to have the first habitat ready later in 2018, but the new - and remote - facility will not be open to the public; the Keenesburg location will remain the public education and outreach center. To help pay for the new property, the sanctuary launched the Founder Program to offer various incentives for new donations. Education Estimates in 2007 were that 25,000 or more wild animals were living in captivity outside the zoo system in the United States. Many of these are mistreated or abused, and many are being kept illegally. The Wild Animal Sanctuary believes that education about these animals is critical to informing the public and helping to provide better conditions for the animals. The visitor center at the sanctuary provides information about these animals, and the sanctuary has speakers who do presentations for a variety of organizations.

Also on the estate are a garage, two guest cottages, a studio, and a circular swimming pool. The property was purchased by Harrison and his wife in the early 1930s. Harrison bought a prefabricated house for $1000, the Aluminaire House, designed by A. Lawrence Kocher and Albert Frey for the Architectural League Show of 1931 in New York. He also embarked on the main house, which was initially built as a wing to what was called the \\"Tin House.\\" As the complex grew the Tin House was relocated and became a guest cottage. The estate was sold by the Harrisons in 1974 to Hester Diamond, who placed the estate on the National Register of Historic Places. Subsequent owners placed the house for sale amid concerns about potential demolition, but the house was restored by the buyers, with guidance from architects SchappacherWhite. The Aluminaire House was disassembled and acquired by the New York Institute of Technology campus at Central Islip, which reassembled it. The property is to be transferred to a trust dedicated to its maintenance. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

It was founded as the Cold Spring Harbor Village Improvement Society in 1899. However, the library, consisting of a small collection of books, was first organized in 1886 and was housed at the Cutting House, 241 Harbor Road, Cold Spring Harbor. This building was located across the street from the local gristmill and the first librarian was the miller's wife, Mrs. Peter Waters. This building is now owned by the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. History In the 1890s, the library was run by the operator of the local telegraph office, Annie Wright. It is not clear exactly where the library was located during this time period, but it is thought to have been housed at the Jones & Hewlett store, next to the mill. This building, 222 Harbor Road, is now also owned by the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. In the late 1890s, the library was moved to Thespian Hall, a local venue for theatrical performances, lectures, and political meetings, located at the northeast corner of Harbor Road and Terrace Place. In 1896, this building became the Phoenix Fire Engine Company. In 1896, the library moved to a more populated area near the intersection of Main Street and Shore Road. This was a small building which also served as the post office and telegraph office. It is now home to the Cold Spring Harbor Barbershop. Several years later, the library's collection of books were moved to what is now 117 Main Street. In 1899, the Cold Spring Harbor Village Improvement Society was formed and in May 1899, adopted the Library as one of its activities. By this point in time, the library needed a larger and permanent building. Community donations made possible the construction of a building in 1913 which overlooked the harbor from the corner of Shore Road and Main Street in Cold Spring Harbor. It is a handsome, one story five bay brick building with a hipped roof in the Classical Revival style. It featured a decorative octagonal cupola atop the roof and the entrance had a pedimented portico supported by Doric order columns. Note: This includes The library outgrew this space after about 70 years. The trustees of the library sold the building to the Society for the Preservation of Long Island Antiquities after which they rented a space from the Cold Spring Harbor School District in the East Side School building on Goose Hill Road. In 1999, the school district decided not to renew the lease. In 2000, the library entered into an agreement with the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation for a long-term lease of five-acres of the newly created Cold Spring Harbor State Park. On August 9, 2006, the library moved into its current home at 95 Harbor Road, Cold Spring Harbor.

By Renato Grandelle. O Globo, 1 October 2014) is an architect and urban designer, Director of City Design at the City of Melbourne, Australia. He won multiple awards as the leader of the revitalization of the Melbourne City Centre and surrounds, helping to create a vibrant city streetscape with innovative design features. Background Adams grew up in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and gained a B.Arch at the University of Cape Town, South Africa in the 1960s. He later took a Masters in Urban Design from Oxford Brookes University in the UK. He helped establish an urban design course in Zimbabwe in 1978-80, before moving to Australia. Since the mid-1980s he has worked at the City of Melbourne. He is a regular lecturer at RMIT and at the University of Melbourne, where he has been a Professorial Fellow since 2004. Urban design in Melbourne Council House 2 (CH2), Melbourne In 1985 the city centre of Melbourne was in need of revitalization, with retail trading and cultural activities lagging behind its counterparts elsewhere in Australia and in Europe. Adams helped to write, and to put in place, the first comprehensive urban design strategy for the City, based on the idea of creating a vibrant and well populated street-scape profiting from the city's multi-mode transport system. He guided the strategy's implementation in several projects, which took place as the city recovered from economic recession in the late 1980s and was prepared to invest in the built environment. These included Postcode 3000 (bringing redundant buildings into use, particularly for apartments in the city centre), the redevelopment of Swanston Street as a pedestrian friendly street, the QV development, the creation of a new riverfront park called Birrarung Marr from under-used rail sidings,Raxworthy, J.R. 2003. Birrarung Marr. Architectural Review Australia, 84. pp. 46-49. the Queensbridge Precinct, the Turning Basin, and the CH2 building which was the first purpose-built office building in Australia to achieve a maximum Six Green Star rating and which has passive heating and cooling, power generation and blackwater treatment.ABC: Council House 2 - The eco-office block of the future, 19 April 2007, retrieved 28 January 2011 He has also overseen the installation of kilometers of detailed bluestone paving across the city, opened up laneways for retail use, redesigned the Yarra River frontage with walkways and new pedestrian bridges, installed street furniture and art, new lighting, signage and extensive tree planting. Adams' urban revitalization work in the urban core has assisted Melbourne to become one of the world's most liveable cities. Comprehensive urban design programs over two decades has seen a reversal in the way the city, and particularly its center, is perceived. By the mid-1990s Melbourne was ranked highly in indices of desirable cities - as of 2010 Melbourne took second place in the 2010 Economist's World's Most Livable Cities Index and rose to first in 2011, and second again in 2020.2010 Economist's World's Most Livable Cities Index Adams has also promoted the arts and culture of Melbourne through projects such as Blue Line, Travellers, and Birrarung Wilam. He has expanded the City‚Äôs cultural program through venues such as ArtPlay (a venue for children's art and teaching activities),ArtPlay MeatMarket, ArtHouse and the Town Hall Gallery.The construction of the Crown Casino on the Yarra in a prime riverside site was allegedly not one of his favored projects, but pushed through by the Kennett government of the time. It resulted in the relocation of the Melbourne museum. Currently, he is engaged in work looking at how to accommodate over a million extra people forecast to move to Melbourne in the next few decades, within the existing metropolitan boundary. He advocates medium density, 5+storey development for housing and commercial uses along the major tram and bus corridors leading out of the centre, but only in locations with rear access to properties. Accommodating these numbers in new residential developments and existing suburbs would avoid further urban sprawl. In 2020 hea rgued the pandemic would leave central city office space also available for housing. Significant greening and reorientation of roadscapes would accompany these measures, which were outlined in the 'Transforming Cities' report of 2010Transforming Australian Cities For a More Financially Viable And Sustainable Future.

History In the first two decades of the 20th century, the once predominantly rural Grosse Pointe area transformed into a residential suburb of Detroit. In 1921, in response to the influx of families, five school districts in what is now the Grosse Pointe area were consolidated into Rural Agricultural District No. 1 (later renamed the Grosse Pointe Public School District). The first building constructed after consolidation was Defer Elementary School, built on the site of a rhubarb patch owned by Ludwig Meininger.Ann Marie Aliotta, Suzy Berschback, Grosse Pointe, Arcadia Publishing, 2007, , p. 35 Defer was designed by architect George J. Haas and completed in 1924. The school was named for George Defer, who was at the time the president of Grosse Pointe Park. At the time of construction, the surrounding neighborhoods were quickly growing, and by 1927 the school was overcrowded. An addition to the school was constructed in 1928. Description Defer Elementary School is a three-story rectangular building built in the Tudor Revival style. This revival style was popular in Detroit and across the country in the years following World War I, and is symbolic of the prosperity of the era. The exterior is of brick with limestone detailing surrounding doors and windows. The doors are wood panelled with Gothic arches. The interior is decorated with Pewabic tile; in particular the kindergarten room contains a Pewabic fireplace and drinking fountain. The 1928 addition contains additional classrooms and a leaded glass conservatory. Modern use and feeder pattern Defer Elementary School is still used by the Grosse Pointe Public School District as an elementary school, and is the oldest building in the district.Defer Elementary School at a glance from GrossePointeToday.com, retrieved 3/13/2010 Typical enrollment was 465 students, but as of 2010 that number had dropped to approximately 420.

Origin of the book  The author of Journey Among Warriors, French pianist, journalist and writer √àve Curie (daughter of Marie and Pierre Curie), fled to the United Kingdom after the surrender of France in June 1940, where she joined the Free French Forces and General Charles de Gaulle. She fought Nazism mainly as a journalist, publishing articles and giving lectures. She spent the war years mostly in Britain and the United States, writing articles for New York Herald Tribune. In November 1941, her employers ‚Äì Herald Tribune Syndicate from New York City and Allied Newspapers Limited from London ‚Äì decided to send √àve Curie as a reporter on a journey to the countries in which warfare had already been waging. √àve was to visit Africa, the Near East, the Soviet Union, China and to return via Singapore, the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco to the East Coast of the USA, her planned journey being, in fact, a trip around the world. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 resulted in modifying these plans. After √àve Curie had reached China, she could not continue her journey to Singapore, which had already been taken by the Japanese, so she returned, also via Asia and Africa, to the US. She systematically wrote reports from the journey to the newspapers which employed her, and on the basis of these reports, the book Journey Among Warriors was published in 1943.  Synopsis  Journey Among Warriors consists of five parts, each describing one stage in the author's journey.  Part I ‚Äì Africa  Boeing 314 Clipper, on which √àve Curie reached Africa √àve Curie's journey started on November 10, 1941√àve Curie, Journey Among Warriors, Garden City, New York 1943, p. 1. when she set off from New York to Africa on board a Boeing 314 Clipper. This was the first, experimental flight of this huge flying boat from America to the west coast of the African continent, which was why it was kept secret both by Pan American World Airways, which operated the airline, and the American government. √àve was the only woman and the only journalist among the 40 passengers or so of the flying boat; most of her travel companions being members of the staff of Pan Am who were flying to Africa to prepare the infrastructure for the planned flight service on which war supplies (including military planes) were to be transported from the US to the Middle East (even though the United States was a non-belligerent country at that time, it actively supported the Allies with supplies of war equipment). Via Bermuda, Puerto Rico, Trinidad and the Brazilian coast √àve Curie reached Bathurst in the Gambia and then Lagos in Nigeria (which were British colonies then). Even though there was no warfare waged on the West African coast at that time, the threat from the Axis powers was felt everywhere in the region, and everybody worked at full steam to provide supplies to the front. In Nigeria, √àve also first met her Polish half- compatriots ‚Äì a Captain Izicki told her how Polish and British pilots ferried the planes assembled in West Africa in convoys over the jungles and deserts to Sudan and later to Egypt.Curie, Journey Among Warriors, p. 16. From Nigeria, √àve Curie flew to Khartoum in Sudan, with stopovers, among others, in Kano, where she met the local emir, and Fort-Lamy in Chad, which was controlled by the Free French. In Khartoum she learned about the offensive the British had started in Cyrenaica, and she left for Egypt to write a report about the fights. Despite the initial reservations of the military, who opposed to a woman being so close to the front line, √àve, thanks to the help of Randolph Churchill (Winston Churchill's son), managed to come near the places in Libya where the British fought the German and Italian troops in desert areas, in very unfavorable climatic conditions. Having returned to Egypt, √àve also visited a harbor on the Red Sea where American ships with supplies for the fighting British were being unloaded, and on December 8 she was shocked to learn about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.Curie, Journey Among Warriors, p. 64. When she later heard about further conquests of the Japanese in the Far East, she realized that she might not fulfill her plans to reach Singapore.  Part II ‚Äì The Near East  From Cairo, √àve Curie flew first to Beirut where she met General Georges Catroux,Curie, Journey Among Warriors, p. 75. who had been appointed by de Gaulle High Commissioner to the Levant. The reporter also made herself acquainted with the situation in Syria and Palestine. Even though the Free French controlled these territories, they still had to cope with the problem of political sabotage operations conducted by the Germans and the Italians, who were broadcasting radio programs aimed at the local Arab population. These acts of sabotage also took on graver forms ‚Äì anti-British feeling in nearby Iraq, which had been growing for some time, resulted in breaking out of the Anglo-Iraqi War in 1941. After several days, √àve flew from Lydda Airport farther to the east, to Teheran, the capital of Iran. Formally, during the World War II, Iran was an independent and neutral country; in fact, since August 1941, it had been under common British-Soviet occupation. The concern about the growing German influence in Iran, the willingness to secure the local oil deposits and, first of all, the importance of Iran as a transit country for supplies of war equipment to the Soviet Union resulted in an Anglo-Soviet intervention. The British and Soviet troops occupied the country, forced Reza Shah Pahlavi to abdicate and brought his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to the throne. Since then to the end of the war, Iran was a very important communication hub ‚Äì a transit country via which Western militaries and diplomats were traveling to the Soviet Union and one of the channels through which American war equipment was sent to the USSR under the Lend-Lease Act. In Teheran, √àve Curie had to wait for several weeks for an opportunity to leave for the Soviet Union. She spent this time, meeting politicians and soldiers, including the Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland in exile and the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski,Curie, Journey Among Warriors, p. 103. who, despite his country's negative experiences with the USSR (in September 1939, Poland had been invaded both by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, and many Poles were deported by the Soviets to Siberia, Kazakhstan and other regions of the interior of the USSR), still hoped for a common fight of Polish soldiers on the side of the Soviets against the Germans. In Teheran, Curie also had a meeting with Shah Reza Pahlavi, who, probably because of his young age (he was only 22 years old), did not feel fully comfortable on the throne yet.Curie, Journey Among Warriors, p. 108.  Part III ‚Äì Russia  √àve left Teheran on January 6, 1942, flying via Baku to Kuybyshev (now Samara), where the embassies and many Soviet central offices had been evacuated to from Moscow because of the threatening German offensive at the end of 1941. Already on board the plane she could observe the frozen Caspian Sea; biting frost and snow were to accompany her during her whole stay in the USSR. In Kuybyshev she met wounded soldiers in the local hospital, visited a bearings factory evacuated from Moscow where workers labored and lived in extremely difficult conditions, she also attended a service in an Orthodox church and talked to its priest (after the outbreak of the war, Joseph Stalin had slightly alleviated his policy of persecutions of religion). Both in Baku, Kuybyshew and later in Moscow, √àve could see how important culture, even though much ideologized, was for the fighting Soviet Union ‚Äì she watched theatrical and opera performances and went to other cultural events, in Kuybyshew she also interviewed Olga Lepeshinskaya, an outstanding Soviet ballerina of that time.Curie, Journey Among Warriors, p. 147. During her stay in the USSR √àve Curie was constantly \\"looked after\\" by Lieutenant Liuba Mieston, who was officially her translator, but in fact, as Curie was guessing, worked for NKVD and supervised her contacts with the inhabitants of the Soviet Union. Despite this, both women became friends, √àve wrote very warmly about Liuba in her memoirs. After several days of efforts, √àve succeeded in obtaining a permission to visit the front line. On January 12 (before other foreign correspondents, who stayed in Kuybyshev) she flew on a military plane with Liuba to Moscow, and on January 15 she could leave the capital for the places where fights were going on. In December 1941, as a result of the so-called Battle of Moscow, the Soviets had managed to repel the Germans from the capital; the hostilities were now going on around 60 miles from the borders of the city. On her way to the front, Curie could see many examples of atrocities the Germans committed on civilians ‚Äì burnt down villages and towns; their inhabitants who were now coming back told her about robberies and mass executions conducted by the Nazis. Now, the German troops were withdrawing, and their defeat was also the result of harsh climatic conditions ‚Äì this was the first winter for the Germans on the east front for which they were not prepared either in terms of clothing or military equipment. Many times, √àve saw corpses of German soldiers on the snow. After they had arrived in Volokolamsk, √àve and Liuba also had an interesting meeting with General Andrey Vlasov, the commander of the Soviet troops fighting at Moscow.Curie, Journey Among Warriors, p. 170. Vlasov appeared to her as a faithful soldier and Soviet patriot; she did not know yet that after a few months he would be taken prisoner by the Germans and defect to the Nazis as the commander of the Russian Liberation Army.√àve probably still did not know about Vlasov's betrayal at the moment of the publication of Journey Among Warriors, because she did not mention it in the book. The Russian Liberation Army was formed and sent to the front by the Germans only in 1943. On January 18, √àve again left Moscow to visit just relieved Tula (it had been besieged by the Germans from October to December 1941) and Lev Tolstoy's house in Yasnaya Polyana. In Tula, the local secretary of the Communist party Zhavoronkov told her about the hardships of the three-month siege;Curie, Journey Among Warriors, p. 204. in the town, √àve also met one of local Soviet partisans (guerillas) ‚Äì Esipov, a carpenter, who had fought the Germans behind the frontline.Curie, Journey Among Warriors, p. 200. On the next day (January 19), √àve and Liuba, accompanied by Sophia Andreyevna Tolstoy (Lev Tolstoy's grandniece), who supervised all Tolstoy's museums in the USSR, visited Tolstoy's family house in Yasnaya Polyana, which the Germans had converted into a mess for Wehrmacht officers and tried to burn down when they were withdrawing. √àve also wanted to see the siege of Leningrad but was refused a permit to fly to the city, so she stayed in the capital for some time, observing the daily life of its inhabitants, taking part in Moscow's cultural life (she saw for example the opera Eugene Onegin by Tchaikovsky) and meeting scientists at the Geological Institute and the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, where she learnt about huge losses (running into millions) of the Soviet army on the front.Curie, Journey Among Warriors, p. 239. The last trip to the areas where hostilities were going on was a short visit to Mozhaysk, where she went on January 23, just one day after the Germans had been driven from it. Again, she could hear about the atrocities of the Nazis, who had buried 200 people alive in the blown-up cathedral and tried to burn down the town. √àve also had the opportunity to talk to German soldiers who were taken prisoner and see how much their morale had lowered, because of the severe winter and defeats on the front.Curie, Journey Among Warriors, s. 250. Polish volunteers to the Anders Army, released from Gulag labor camps On January 26, √àve flew back from Moscow to Kuybyshev to catch the return plane to Iran. She spent the time of waiting for the plane mostly in the Polish embassy where she met the ambassador Stanis≈Çaw Kot and many Polish soldiers who had just been released from Gulag labor camps and wanted to join the Polish army which was just being formed under the command of General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski. She learnt from an officer named Grzybowski (who was also a pianist, like √àve) about the life in an officers' camp in Vologda in northern Russia; an unnamed aristocrat, who was arrested in 1939 and also spent a long time in a Soviet prison, told her about the comfort religion gave him during that time. √àve also learnt about the tragic fate of many other Poles who were deported to remote regions of the country and about the difficulties the Polish authorities had to cope with to find them in the depths of Russia.√àve did not know then yet that about 22,000 Polish officers who had been taken prisoner by the Soviets in 1939 had been murdered on Stalin's order in 1940. This war crime, known as the Katyn massacre, was discovered only in 1943. She could also see how determined both the Polish military and the civilians were to get out of the USSR and return to Poland. In a conversation with her, General Anders gave voice to this desire saying: \\"We will get to Poland. Not all of us, of course, But Poland will live.\\"Curie, Journey Among Warriors, p. 276. √àve Curie's description of her stay in the Soviet Union took up most space in her book; this was also the stage of her journey which most impressed her. √àve's attitude towards the Soviet reality was ambivalent. On the one hand, she perceived the authoritarian character of the Soviet political system, the political and religious persecutions, she realized that many of the people she talked to (for example the priest in the Orthodox church in Kuybyshev) were afraid to tell even her ‚Äì a Western correspondent ‚Äì openly what they thought about the life in the USSR; meeting Polish exiles in the USSR, she also learned the truth (or at least part of it) about Communist crimes in the Soviet Union. On the other hand, she was full of admiration for the sacrifice of ordinary soldiers and civilians fighting the invaders; her fascination for the Soviet system, which was so different from the systems in other countries which were known to her, can be seen in many places of the book. √àve Curie certainly was not one of the \\"fellow travelers\\", who sympathized with Communist ideology and the Soviet Union, but she was not their fierce critic either.  Part IV ‚Äì Asia  √àve Curie flew back from Kuybyshev to Iran on January 29, 1942. In Teheran, she learnt about furthers conquests of the Japanese in the Far East; nevertheless, she made an attempt to reach Singapore. She went by train to Abadan, the seat of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, then by plane to Basra, where she again heard about the pro-German sympathies of the Iraqis, finally from Basra by flying boat to Calcutta in India, which she reached on February 8. The journey to Singapore was no longer possible (the Japanese conquered the city on February 15, after a week's siege), so instead √àve flew to Burma, which was also a British colony then.Curie, Journey Among Warriors, p. 299. In Burma, Curie was staying in Lashio, in the north-eastern part of the country, at the house of Arthur Porter, the British Commissioner for the Northern Shan States. She also visited Rangoon and other places; throughout the country she could feel tension because of the attacking Japanese. In Burma, for the third time during her journey, √àve was also in close proximity of the front. On the 15th of February she drove in a station wagon forward of the British positions at the Bilin River with the intention of traveling to Thaton which was in the process of being evacuated. She was eventually ordered to turn around by British officers at an outpost along the road as she was approaching the no mans land between the British and Japanese armies.Curie, Journey Among Warriors, p. 315-316. The British army was commanded in this area by General John George Smyth, who told her about the difficult situation of his troops ‚Äì the Japanese had better equipment than the British, they also fought fanatically and ruthlessly in the jungle. Because of these factors, all the bravery and dedication to fight of the British and Indian soldiers were in vain: √àve witnessed the chaotic evacuation of the British and other foreigners from Rangoon, who were escaping the approaching Japanese.Curie, Journey Among Warriors, p. 321. Convoy of army trucks on the Ledo Road In her book, √àve Curie also described in detail the Burma Road, running through mountainous areas from Lashio to the Chinese province of Yunnan. This was the main road on which Chinese drivers, in difficult terrain conditions, often at the risk of their lives, transported war supplies for their country, which had been warring with Japan since 1937. Chiang Kai-shek The next stage in √àve Curie' journey was her visit to China, where to she flew by plane from Lashio. She spent most of the time in this country in Chungking, which was the provisional capital during the Second Sino-Japanese War in the years 1937-1945 and the seat of the government of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, which was the reason why it was often bombed by Japanese planes. China had been in a grave political crisis since the 1920s; the war with the external aggressor overlapped with the Chinese Civil War against Mao Zedongs Communists, which started in 1927. √àve also visited the Province of Sichuan with its capital Chengtu, where she could see the difficult living condition (often extreme poverty) of the local population and where she also visited Chinese military schools.Curie, Journey Among Warriors, p. 357. Back in Chungking, √àve also met the Communist General Zhou Enlai, who was a sort of envoy of the Communists to Chiang Kai-shek' central government, the widow of Sun Yat-sen (the Father of the Republic of China), finally Chiang Kai-shek himself and his Americanized wife Soong Mei-ling, known as Madame Chiang Kai-shek.Curie, Journey Among Warriors, p. 387. On her way back from China to India, √àve Curie also met one of the so-called Flying Tigers, and during a stopover in Kunming she could interview their commander ‚Äì Claire Lee Chennault. The Flying Tigers were American pilots who had been fighting the Japanese voluntarily in the ranks of the Chinese air force since 1941; they were known as daring, even though often undisciplined soldiers.Curie, Journey Among Warriors, p. 395. Gandhi and Nehru in 1942 Having returned from China to Calcutta, √àve could observe the growing fear of the Japanese invasion which could be felt in the city and the whole of Bengal. India's economy had already been mobilized for war production since 1939; the Indians themselves, however, were not fully convinced of the necessity of this war effort and sacrificing their lives for Britain. Already flying from Basra to Calcutta in February, during a stopover in Karachi, √àve Curie had first met sympathizers of the Indian National Congress; now she could talk to more and more nationalists demanding independence for their country. Going by train from Calcutta to Delhi, Curie also made a short visit to Allahabad, where she met Jawaharlal Nehru, a prominent member of the Congress, representing its left wing, and his daughter Indira Gandhi (the future Prime Minister of India), who was just getting ready for her wedding (on the following day she was to marry Feroze Gandhi). Nehru explained to Curie his views on India's independence, which was becoming a more and more urgent issue in the British Empire.Curie, Journey Among Warriors, p. 417. Curie's stay in India coincided with the visit of Stafford Cripps, Lord Privy Seal, who came from Britain to present some new proposals of the British government aiming at increasing India's autonomy (√àve also had a meeting with him in New Delhi). The British proposals, however, were received rather coolly by the Indians, who demanded \\"independence now\\", as their slogan went. After arriving in New Delhi, √àve was staying in the residence of General Archibald Wavell, commander of the British forces in the Far East. There she also met Governor-General of India Victor Hope; the most important event on this stage of her journey was, however, her meeting with Mahatma Gandhi on March 28. During that meeting, which greatly impressed her, Gandhi presented her his philosophy of nonviolent resistance and non-opposing the evil, even facing the German and Japanese threat and the danger of physical elimination by the enemy.Curie, Journey Among Warriors, p. 452. Soon after this conversation, √àve also met Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League and the future founder of Pakistan. As a result of the meeting, she became aware of how great the scale of religious conflicts between the Hinduists and the Muslims is and realized that the country may disintegrate after regaining independence.  Part V ‚Äì Back to America  √àve Curie set off on her return journey from New Delhi to America on April 4, 1942, on a flying boat traveling via the Near East, Africa and South America. The United States was already openly taking part in the war, so everywhere she met American soldiers, pilots and technicians, in service along with the British, Free French and soldiers from other countries. The last pages of the book are a hymn praising the cooperation of the Allies, American values, freedom and democracy in the fight with the German and Japanese invaders.  Significance of Journey Among Warriors  Journey Among Warriors is not a piece of war reportage in the strict sense of the word. During her 5-month journey √àve Curie was only three times in the immediate vicinity of the front line: during the fights in the Libyan Desert, in the Soviet Union and in Burma. Nevertheless, the book is an important document showing the events of the Second World War, not only in the direct combat zone but also in the hinterland. √àve Curie wrote not only about military operations but also logistic processes supporting them (for example Lend-Lease supplies of American equipment), problems connected with equipping of millions of soldiers etc. During her journey, √àve often met high military commanders and politicians, which gives the reader insight into the behind- the-scenes of World War II. Some of Curie's interlocutors became widely known already after the publication of the book, for example the Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the commander of the Russian Liberation Army Andrey Vlasov, or the Chinese military and politician Zhou Enlai, which only increases the value of the book as a historical source quoting their opinions. Another value of Journey Among Warriors is its documentary character ‚Äì the book depicts the life of civilians in the warring countries, their sacrifice, daily toil, joys and hardships. The descriptions of the life in the Soviet Union and China are especially valuable here. Admittedly, the author does not always remain objective (which is visible especially in her fascination for the Soviet Union); however, also in this respect, her book is an interesting historical source.  Reception of Journey Among Warriors  Journey Among Warriors, which was published in 1943 (the war was still going on then), received a favorable reception by the public and critics, even though it was sometimes criticized for its excessive length (the book is over 500 pages long). In 1944, Journey Among Warriors was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Correspondence; eventually, it was not awarded the prize, which went to Ernest Taylor Pyle, also for war correspondence. After the war, the book was not reissued and it was largely forgotten.

It is the main axis of long distance and regional rail transport on the east‚Äìwest axis of the Ruhr and is served by Intercity- Express, InterCity, Regional-Express, Regionalbahn and S-Bahn trains. Strictly speaking, the line today consists of two parallel two-track lines, one for mainline trains and the other for S-Bahn trains. On several sections of the line the long-distance tracks and S-Bahn tracks follow separate routes. The long-distance tracks follows the historical route built between 1860 and 1862 by the Bergisch-M√§rkische Railway Company as an extension of its trunk line between Elberfeld and Dortmund. Work at Essen-Kray S√ºd junction History  The Cologne-Minden Railway Company (German, old spelling: C√∂ln-Mindener Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, CME) planned the route of its trunk line, built from 1845 to 1847, to avoid the construction costs of a line through the very hilly land along the valleys of the Ruhr and Wupper rivers and in order to minimise operating costs. It was thus cut off from the coal mines, which is the mid-19th Century were found on the north bank of the Ruhr. Between 1847 and 1849 Bergisch-M√§rkische Railway Company (Bergisch-M√§rkische Eisenbahn- Gesellschaft, BME) built its own trunk line in the highly industrialised area in the Wupper valley and the Bergisches Land and decided to extend it to the west through the area between the Ruhr and the Emscher rivers. In particular it wanted to connect the coal mines north of the Ruhr with a port on the Rhine. Construction of the original line  On 26 October 1860, the first section was opened from Witten BME to Bochum BME (at one time called Bochum Sud station). On 1 March 1862 the section from Bochum to Steele, Essen BME M√ºlheim BME, Styrum and Oberhausen BME was opened. A few weeks later on 1 May 1862, the section from Styrum to Duisburg BME opened. In the same year, the route from Langendreer BME east to Dortmund BME was rebuilt and opened for passenger traffic on 5 October 1862.  Styrum‚ÄîRuhrort line  In later years the line was steadily improved and branches were built. In 1864 the BME took over the management of the lines of the Aachen-Dusseldorf-Ruhrort Railway Company (formally the K√∂nigliche Direction der Aachen-D√ºsseldorf-Ruhrorter Eisenbahn). On 8 January 1866, it took over the company, including the Ruhrort-Homberg train ferry. It opened a line on 4 December 1867 to Ruhrort from Styrum via Meiderich (Sud), partly parallel with the older line of the CME from Oberhausen crossing the Rhine-Herne Canal on a bridge constructed with gauntlet track.  Essen‚ÄîBochum‚ÄîHerne line  On 1 November 1874 the BME opened an additional line parallel to the existing track from Essen BME to Wattenscheid BME and Bochum BME and from there to Riemke, Herne Rottbruch and Herne BME (Bochum‚ÄìEssen/Oberhausen line). The line was initially used for freight with passenger services commencing on 1 January 1875. After the transfer of the station from the former Bochum BME station to the current Bochum Hauptbahnhof in 1957 the connection from Bochum West to the line to Herne was closed. Instead, a connecting line was built a kilometre east in 1979 from the new Hauptbahnhof to Bochum West. The route is now divided into two completely different sections. The western section is now used by long- distance services between Duisburg and Dortmund (other services follow the original route), while the northern section is now only used by regional trains to Gelsenkirchen via the Bochum‚ÄìGelsenkirchen railway and freight trains. Redevelopment for the S-Bahn  As part of the establishment of the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn in the early 1970s, the line was rebuilt to have at least four-tracks continuously. On 23 September 1973, the four line section between M√ºlheim and M√ºlheim-Styrum was inaugurated and on 10 December 1973 it was extended to Duisburg Hbf. After the opening of two more sections on 11 March 1974 between Essen Hbf and Essen-Steele and between Essen Hbf and Essen West, the service between Duisburg Gro√üenbaum Bochum Hbf was designated as S-Bahn line S1 and the service between Oberhausen Hbf and Hattingen designated as S3. Since the establishment of the Dortmund University of Technology in 1968 it has been considered necessary to connect it to the S-Bahn network and on 24 September 1983, a completely new route‚Äîpartly underground‚Äîwas opened from Bochum-Langendreer to Dortmund-Dorstfeld, where the line joins the historic route to Dortmund Hauptbahnhof. Redevelopment for long-distance services To relieve the congested Elberfeld-Dortmund line between Witten and Dortmund a new line (route number 2125) was opened on 29 May 1988 from a flying junction at Stockumer Stra√üe junction in Bochum-Langendreer to L√ºtgendortmund junction, including a 565-metre-long tunnel, and connecting to the long-distance lines to Dortmund. Since then, all InterCity Express, InterCity and RE4 Regional-Express trains running between Wuppertal and Dortmund use the new line. Partial closure  At the beginning of the 20th century the line had up to four parallel tracks used exclusively for freight. With the decline of rail freight traffic after World War II on the line much of this track was subsequently abandoned. Some of it was brought back into operation as part of the S-Bahn or with the construction of the new long- distance tracks between Witten and Dortmund. In recent years only series 515 battery railcars ran on the section between Duisburg-Meiderich Sud and M√ºlheim (Ruhr)-Styrum, but these services stopped on 1 April 1995 and the line was closed on 1 May 1996. The southern platform of Duisburg-Meiderich Sud station, the embankment to the east and the bridge over the Rhine-Herne Canal were immediately removed. Current situation  The Witten/Dortmund‚ÄìOberhausen/Duisburg railway since its opening has been of immense importance for the railways of the Ruhr area and has therefore been constantly expanded and modernized; six-line sections were not uncommon. Electrification of the line with overhead lines began in the late 1950s. Today, the main route between Dortmund and Duisburg is a four-track line with a maximum line speed generally between 150 and 160 km/h. The routes to and from Witten are double track and electrified. Its western access is cleared for 120 km/h and the eastern approach through the Oberstra√üe Tunnel is cleared for up to 140 or 155 km/h. Services  All of the various categories of German rail passenger services operate between Dortmund and Duisburg. Long- distance services InterCity Express line 10 services (between Berlin and Cologne) operate hourly on the main east‚Äìwest ICE line. Line 42 (between Dortmund and Munich) operates every two-hours on the north‚Äìsouth ICE line. Additional ICE services are operated as line 31, line 41 (every hour between Duisburg and Essen) and line 91. Every two hours InterCity trains operate over lines 30 and 51, as well as various services of lines 26, 32, and 55. Regional railways The line is the main axis of the Ruhr Regional- Express. Three Regional-Express services run every hour between Dortmund and Duisburg: the NRW-Express (RE 1) between Aachen and Hamm, continuing every two hours to Paderborn; the Rhein-Weser-Express (RE 6) between Minden and D√ºsseldorf and the Rhein-Hellweg-Express (RE 11) between D√ºsseldorf and Hamm. Line S1 of the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn runs at 20-minute intervals on the whole line between Dortmund and Duisburg, using the old line via Steele between Essen and Bochum and the new route opened in 1983 between Bochum and Dortmund. Line S3 runs on the section between Essen-Steele, and M√ºlheim-Styrum on its route between Hattingen Mitte and Oberhausen, providing a 10-minute interval S-Bahn service on this section in combination with S1. The section between Witten and Essen is served by Regional Express service RE16 Ruhr-Sieg-Express (Essen to Siegen and Iserlohn via Hagen) and Regionalbahn service RB40 Ruhr-Lenne-Bahn (Essen‚ÄìHagen). The line between Duisburg and Essen is used by the RE2 Rhein- Haard-Express, with the trains returning to the old Rhenish line between Duisburg and M√∂nchengladbach and between Essen and M√ºnster. RE14 Der Borkener and Line S9 connect Bottrop with Essen Dellwig on the former M√ºlheim- Hei√üen‚ÄìOberhausen-Osterfeld Nord line and then connect to line to Essen at Essen-Frohnhausen station (but not to lines that have access to its platforms). RE14 terminates at Essen, while S9 continues to Essen-Steele Ost, where it connects to the Wuppertal-Vohwinkel‚ÄìEssen-√úberruhr line to Wuppertal.

The American University speech, titled \\"A Strategy of Peace\\", was a commencement address delivered by United States President John F. Kennedy at the American University in Washington, D.C., on Monday, June 10, 1963. Delivered at the height of his rhetorical powers and widely considered one of his most powerful speeches, Kennedy not only outlined a plan to curb nuclear arms, but also \\"laid out a hopeful, yet realistic route for world peace at a time when the U.S. and Soviet Union faced the potential for an escalating nuclear arms race.\\" In the speech, Kennedy announced his agreement to negotiations \\"toward early agreement on a comprehensive test ban treaty\\" (which resulted in the Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty) and also announced, for the purpose of showing \\"good faith and solemn convictions\\", his decision to unilaterally suspend all U.S. atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons as long as all other nations would do the same. Noteworthy are his comments that the United States was seeking a goal of \\"complete disarmament\\" of nuclear weapons and his vow that America \\"will never start a war\\". The speech was unusual in its peaceful outreach to the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War, and is remembered as one of Kennedy's finest and most important speeches.  Background  After the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, Kennedy was determined to construct a better relationship with the Soviet Union to discourage another threat of nuclear war. He believed that Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev was also interested in renewing U.S.‚ÄìSoviet relations. On November 19, 1962, Khrushchev had submitted a report to the Central Committee of the Communist Party that implicitly called for a halt in foreign intervention to concentrate on the economy. One month later, Khrushchev wrote Kennedy a letter stating \\"the time has come now to put an end once and for all to nuclear tests.\\"Schlesinger Jr., Arthur M. A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House. Houghton Mifflin Co, Boston 1965. First printing C. Kennedy greeted this response with enthusiasm and suggested that technical discussions for nuclear inspections begin between representatives of the two governments. However, Kennedy faced opposition for any test ban from Republican leaders and his own State Department. After several months the opposition in the Senate lessened and gave the Kennedy Administration the opportunity to pursue the ban with the Soviet Union. In May 1963, the president informed his National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy that he wished to deliver a major address on peace. According to Special Assistant Ted Sorensen the speech was kept confidential in fear that the unprecedented tone would \\"set off alarm bells in more bellicose quarters in Washington\\" and allow political attacks against Kennedy in advance of the speech.Sorensen, Ted. Counselor: A Life at the Edge of History. Harper-Collins Publishers, New York 2008. In the days before the speech, Kennedy was committed to addressing the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Honolulu and asked Sorensen to construct the initial draft with input from several members of Kennedy's staff. The speech was reviewed and edited by Kennedy and Sorensen on the return flight from Honolulu days before the address. Historian and Special Assistant Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. observed in his diary, \\"from the viewpoint of orderly administration, this was a bad way to prepare a major statement on foreign policy. But the State Department could never in a thousand years have produced this speech.\\"Schlesinger Jr., Arthur M. Journals 1952‚Äì2000. New York, Penguin Books, 2007.  Style  Sorensen had been Kennedy's aide since the 1953 Massachusetts Senatorial election, and eventually served as his primary campaign speechwriter and as Special Counsel during and after the 1960 Presidential election.Schlesinger, Robert. White House Ghosts: Presidents and their Speechwriters. Simon & Schuster, New York 2008. By 1963 he had written drafts for nearly every speech Kennedy delivered in office, including the inaugural address, the Cuban Missile Crisis speech, and the Ich bin ein Berliner speech. Common elements of the Kennedy-Sorensen speeches were alliteration, repetition and chiasmus as well as historical references and quotations. Although Kennedy often interposed off-the-cuff ad-libs to his speeches, he did not deviate from the final draft of the address. Anca Gata described Ted Sorensen as \\"the chief architect of the speech in language, style, composition, and rhetoric. One of the most original issues in the speech was the reintroduction of the Russian people to the Americans as a great culture with important achievements in science and space, and as promoting economic and industrial growth on their own.\\"Gata, Anca. Encyclopedia of the Sixties: A Decade of Culture and Counterculture. Greenwood, 2011, p. 29-30. The content of the speech was unapologetically \\"dovish\\" in its pursuit of peace. Kennedy noted that almost uniquely among the \\"major world powers\\" the United States and Russia had never been at war with each other. He also acknowledged the massive human casualties that Russia suffered during World War II and declared that no nation had \\"ever suffered more than the Soviet Union in the Second World War,\\" a fact that had gone largely unheralded in the West due to the onset of the Cold War. Kennedy sought to draw similarities between the United States and the Soviet Union several times and called for a \\"reexamination\\" of American attitudes towards Russia. He warned that adopting a course towards nuclear confrontation would be \\"evidence only of the bankruptcy of our policy‚Äîor of a collective death- wish for the world.\\" Jeffrey Sachs, American economist and director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, was deeply moved by the speech, \\"not only for its eloquence and content, but also for its relevance to today's global challenges. For in it Kennedy tells us about transforming our deepest aspirations‚Äîin this case for peace‚Äîinto practical realities. He almost presents a method, a dream-and-do combination that soars with high vision and yet walk on earth with practical results.\\" In reviewing the history and context of Kennedy's speech at American University, Sachs' esteem for Kennedy grew further, concluding, \\"I have come to believe that Kennedy's quest for peace is not only the greatest achievement of his presidency, but also one of the greatest acts of world leadership in the modern era.\\"  Aftermath = Soviet response  Kennedy's speech was made available, in its entirety, in the Soviet press so that the people in the Soviet Union could read it without hindrance. Additionally, the speech could be heard in the Soviet Union without censorship because jamming measures against the western broadcast agencies such as Voice of America didn't take place upon rebroadcast of Kennedy's speech. Khrushchev was deeply moved and impressed by Kennedy's speech, telling Undersecretary of State Averell Harriman that it was \\"the greatest speech by any American President since Roosevelt.\\"Douglass, James W. JFK and the Unspeakbale. Why he died and why it matters. Maryknoll, NY, Orbis Books, 2008, p. 45-46. After 12 days of negotiations and less than two months after the president's speech the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was completed. The Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was signed by the governments of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States (represented by Dean Rusk), named the \\"Original Parties\\", at Moscow on August 5, 1963. US ratification occurred by the U.S. Senate on September 24, 1963, by a vote of 80‚Äì19 and the treaty was signed into law by Kennedy on October 7, 1963. The treaty went into effect on October 10, 1963.  Other reactions  The speech was met with little response in the United States; after one week, only 896 letters were sent to the White House concerning its content (in contrast to over 28,000 related to a bill affecting the price of freight). The response from Republicans in Congress was mostly dismissive in nature. Senator Barry Goldwater accused Kennedy of taking a \\"soft stance\\" on the Soviet Union.  Legacy  Robert McNamara, Kennedy's Secretary of Defense, declared at a 2003 memorial event at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum that the speech was \\"one of the great documents of the 20th century.\\" He later commented that it \\"laid out exactly what Kennedy's intentions were.\\" Ted Sorensen considered the address Kennedy's most important speech.

It was originally reserved for samurai in their code of honor but was also practiced by other Japanese people later on to restore honor for themselves or for their families. As a samurai practice, seppuku was used voluntarily by samurai to die with honor rather than fall into the hands of their enemies (and likely be tortured), as a form of capital punishment for samurai who had committed serious offenses, or performed because they had brought shame to themselves. The ceremonial disembowelment, which is usually part of a more elaborate ritual and performed in front of spectators, consists of plunging a short blade, traditionally a tant≈ç, into the belly and drawing the blade from left to right, slicing the belly open. If the cut is deep enough, it can sever the descending aorta, causing a rapid death by blood loss. Etymology Samurai about to perform seppuku The term seppuku is derived from the two Sino- Japanese roots setsu (\\"to cut\\", from Middle Chinese tset; compare Mandarin qi√® and Cantonese chit) and fuku (\\"belly\\", from MC pjuwk; compare Mandarin f√π and Cantonese f≈´k). It is also known as harakiri (ËÖπÂàá„Çä, \\"cutting the stomach\\"); the term harakiri (often misspelled/mispronounced hiri-kiri or hari-kari by American English speakers) is more familiar to non-Japanese speakers than the term seppuku. Harakiri is written with the same kanji as seppuku but in reverse order with an okurigana. In Japanese, the more formal seppuku, a Chinese on'yomi reading, is typically used in writing, while harakiri, a native kun'yomi reading, is used in speech. Ross notes, > It is commonly pointed out that hara-kiri is a vulgarism, but this is a > misunderstanding. Hara-kiri is a Japanese reading or Kun-yomi of the > characters; as it became customary to prefer Chinese readings in official > announcements, only the term seppuku was ever used in writing. So hara-kiri > is a spoken term, but only to commoners and seppuku a written term, but > spoken amongst higher classes for the same act.Ross, Christopher. Mishima's > Sword, p.68. The practice of performing seppuku at the death of one's master, known as oibara (ËøΩËÖπ or ËøΩ„ÅÑËÖπ, the kun'yomi or Japanese reading) or tsuifuku (ËøΩËÖπ, the on'yomi or Chinese reading), follows a similar ritual. The word means \\"suicide\\" in Japanese. The modern word for suicide is . In some popular western texts, such as martial arts magazines, the term is associated with suicide of samurai wives. The term was introduced into English by Lafcadio Hearn in his Japan: An Attempt at Interpretation, an understanding which has since been translated into Japanese. Joshua S. Mostow notes that Hearn misunderstood the term jigai to be the female equivalent of seppuku. Overview Illustration from Sketches of Japanese Manners and Customs, by J. M. W. Silver, Illustrated by Native Drawings, Reproduced in Facsimile by Means of Chromolithography, London, 1867 The first recorded act of seppuku was performed by Minamoto no Yorimasa during the Battle of Uji in 1180. Seppuku was used by warriors to avoid falling into enemy hands and to attenuate shame and avoid possible torture. Samurai could also be ordered by their daimy≈ç (feudal lords) to carry out seppuku. Later, disgraced warriors were sometimes allowed to carry out seppuku rather than be executed in the normal manner. The most common form of seppuku for men was composed of the cutting of the abdomen, and when the samurai was finished, he stretched out his neck for an assistant to sever his spinal cord. It was the assistant's job to decapitate the samurai in one swing, otherwise it would bring great shame to the assistant and his family. Those who did not belong to the samurai caste were never ordered or expected to carry out seppuku. Samurai generally could carry out the act only with permission. Sometimes a daimy≈ç was called upon to perform seppuku as the basis of a peace agreement. This weakened the defeated clan so that resistance effectively ceased. Toyotomi Hideyoshi used an enemy's suicide in this way on several occasions, the most dramatic of which effectively ended a dynasty of daimy≈çs. When the H≈çj≈ç were defeated at Odawara in 1590, Hideyoshi insisted on the suicide of the retired daimy≈ç H≈çj≈ç Ujimasa and the exile of his son Ujinao; with this act of suicide, the most powerful daimy≈ç family in eastern Japan was put to an end. Ritual A tant≈ç prepared for seppukuThe practice was not standardised until the 17th century. In the 12th and 13th centuries, such as with the seppuku of Minamoto no Yorimasa, the practice of a kaishakunin (idiomatically, his \\"second\\") had not yet emerged, thus the rite was considered far more painful. The defining characteristic was plunging either the tachi (longsword), wakizashi (shortsword) or tant≈ç (knife) into the gut and slicing the abdomen horizontally. In the absence of a kaishakunin, the samurai would then remove the blade and stab himself in the throat, or fall (from a standing position) with the blade positioned against his heart. During the Edo period (1600‚Äì1867), carrying out seppuku came to involve a detailed ritual. This was usually performed in front of spectators if it was a planned seppuku, as opposed to one performed on a battlefield. A samurai was bathed, dressed in white robes, and served his favorite foods for a last meal. When he had finished, the knife and cloth were placed on another sanbo and given to the warrior. Dressed ceremonially, with his sword placed in front of him and sometimes seated on special clothes, the warrior would prepare for death by writing a death poem. He would probably consume an important ceremonial drink of sake. He would also give his attendant a cup meant for sake. He would be dressed in the shini-sh≈çzoku, a white kimono worn for death. General Akashi Gidayu preparing to carry out Seppuku after losing a battle for his master in 1582. He had just written his death poem, which is also visible in the upper right corner. By Tsukioka Yoshitoshi around 1890. With his selected kaishakunin standing by, he would open his kimono, take up his tant≈ç‚Äîwhich the samurai held by the blade with a cloth wrapped around so that it would not cut his hand and cause him to lose his grip‚Äîand plunge it into his abdomen, making a left-to-right cut. The kaishakunin would then perform kaishaku, a cut in which the warrior was partially decapitated. The maneuver should be done in the manners of dakikubi (lit. \\"embraced head\\"), in which way a slight band of flesh is left attaching the head to the body, so that it can be hung in front as if embraced. Because of the precision necessary for such a maneuver, the second was a skilled swordsman. The principal and the kaishakunin agreed in advance when the latter was to make his cut. Usually dakikubi would occur as soon as the dagger was plunged into the abdomen. Over time, the process became so highly ritualised that as soon as the samurai reached for his blade the kaishakunin would strike. Eventually even the blade became unnecessary and the samurai could reach for something symbolic like a fan, and this would trigger the killing stroke from his second. The fan was likely used when the samurai was too old to use the blade or in situations where it was too dangerous to give him a weapon. This elaborate ritual evolved after seppuku had ceased being mainly a battlefield or wartime practice and became a para-judicial institution. The second was usually, but not always, a friend. If a defeated warrior had fought honourably and well, an opponent who wanted to salute his bravery would volunteer to act as his second. In the Hagakure, Yamamoto Tsunetomo wrote: A specialized form of seppuku in feudal times was known as kanshi (Ë´´Ê≠ª, \\"remonstration death/death of understanding\\"), in which a retainer would commit suicide in protest of a lord's decision. The retainer would make one deep, horizontal cut into his abdomen, then quickly bandage the wound. After this, the person would then appear before his lord, give a speech in which he announced the protest of the lord's action, then reveal his mortal wound. This is not to be confused with funshi (ÊÜ§Ê≠ª, indignation death), which is any suicide made to state dissatisfaction or protest. A fictional variation of kanshi was the act of kagebara (Èô∞ËÖπ, \\"shadow belly\\") in Japanese theater, in which the protagonist, at the end of the play, would announce to the audience that he had committed an act similar to kanshi, a predetermined slash to the belly followed by a tight field dressing, and then perish, bringing about a dramatic end. Some samurai chose to perform a considerably more taxing form of seppuku known as j≈´monji giri (ÂçÅÊñáÂ≠óÂàá„Çä, \\"cross-shaped cut\\"), in which there is no kaishakunin to put a quick end to the samurai's suffering. It involves a second and more painful vertical cut on the belly. A samurai performing j≈´monji giri was expected to bear his suffering quietly until he bled to death, passing away with his hands over his face. Female ritual suicide The wife of Onodera Junai, one of the Forty-seven Ronin, prepares for her suicide; note the legs tied together, a feature of female seppuku to ensure a decent posture in death Female ritual suicide (incorrectly referred to in some English sources as jigai), was practiced by the wives of samurai who have performed seppuku or brought dishonor. Some women belonging to samurai families committed suicide by cutting the arteries of the neck with one stroke, using a knife such as a tant≈ç or kaiken. The main purpose was to achieve a quick and certain death in order to avoid capture. Before committing suicide, a woman would often tie her knees together so her body would be found in a dignified pose, despite the convulsions of death. Invading armies would often enter homes to find the lady of the house seated alone, facing away from the door. On approaching her, they would find that she had ended her life long before they reached her. History Stephen R. Turnbull provides extensive evidence for the practice of female ritual suicide, notably of samurai wives, in pre-modern Japan. One of the largest mass suicides was the 25 April 1185 final defeat of Taira no Tomomori. The wife of Onodera Junai, one of the Forty-seven Ronin, is a notable example of a wife following seppuku of a samurai husband. A large number of honor suicides marked the defeat of the Aizu clan in the Boshin War of 1869, leading into the Meiji era. For example, in the family of Saig≈ç Tanomo, who survived, a total of twenty two female honor suicides are recorded among one extended family. Religious and social context Voluntary death by drowning was a common form of ritual or honour suicide. The religious context of thirty-three J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ adherents at the funeral of Abbot Jitsunyo in 1525 was faith in Amida Buddha and belief in rebirth in his Pure land, but male seppuku did not have a specifically religious context. By way of contrast, the religious beliefs of Hosokawa Gracia, the Christian wife of daimy≈ç Hosokawa Tadaoki, prevented her from committing suicide. Terminology The word means \\"suicide\\" in Japanese. The usual modern word for suicide is . Related words include , and . In some popular western texts, such as martial arts magazines, the term is associated with suicide of samurai wives. The term was introduced into English by Lafcadio Hearn in his Japan: An Attempt at Interpretation, an understanding which has since been translated into Japanese and Hearn seen through Japanese eyes. Joshua S. Mostow notes that Hearn misunderstood the term jigai to be the female equivalent of seppuku. Mostow's context is analysis of Giacomo Puccini's Madame Butterfly and the original Cio-Cio San story by John Luther Long. Though both Long's story and Puccini's opera predate Hearn's use of the term jigai, the term has been used in relation to western japonisme which is the influence of Japanese culture on the western arts. As capital punishment ≈åishi Yoshio was sentenced to commit seppuku in 1703 While the voluntary seppuku is the best known form, in practice the most common form of seppuku was obligatory seppuku, used as a form of capital punishment for disgraced samurai, especially for those who committed a serious offense such as rape, robbery, corruption, unprovoked murder or treason. The samurai were generally told of their offense in full and given a set time for them to commit seppuku, usually before sunset on a given day. On occasion, if the sentenced individuals were uncooperative or outright refused to end their own lives, seppuku could be carried out by an executioner, or more often, the actual execution was carried out solely by decapitation while retaining only the trappings of seppuku; even the tant≈ç laid out in front of the uncooperative offender could be replaced with a fan (to prevent the uncooperative offenders from using the tant≈ç as a weapon against the observers or the executioner). Unlike voluntary seppuku, seppuku carried out as capital punishment by executioners did not necessarily absolve, or pardon, the offender's family of the crime. Depending on the severity of the crime, all or part of the property of the condemned could be confiscated, and the family would be punished by being stripped of rank, sold into long-term servitude, or executed. Seppuku was considered the most honorable capital punishment apportioned to samurai. Zanshu (Êñ¨È¶ñ) and sarashikubi (Êôí„ÅóÈ¶ñ), decapitation followed by a display of the head, was considered harsher and was reserved for samurai who committed greater crimes. The harshest punishments, usually involving death by torturous methods like kamayude (ÈáúËåπ„Åß), death by boiling, were reserved for commoner offenders. Recorded events On February 15, 1868, eleven French sailors of the Dupleix entered the town of Sakai without official permission. Their presence caused panic among the residents. Security forces were dispatched to turn the sailors back to their ship, but a fight broke out and the sailors were shot dead. Upon the protest of the French representative, financial compensation was paid, and those responsible were sentenced to death. Captain Abel-Nicolas Bergasse du Petit-Thouars was present to observe the execution. As each samurai committed ritual disembowelment, the violent act shocked the captain, and he requested a pardon, as a result of which nine of the samurai were spared. This incident was dramatised in a famous short story, \\"Sakai Jiken\\", by Mori ≈ågai. In the 1860s, the British Ambassador to Japan, Algernon Freeman-Mitford (Lord Redesdale), lived within sight of Sengaku-ji where the Forty-seven Ronin are buried. In his book Tales of Old Japan, he describes a man who had come to the graves to kill himself: Mitford also describes his friend's eyewitness account of a seppuku: During the Meiji Restoration, the Tokugawa shogun's aide performed seppuku: In his book Tales of Old Japan, Mitford describes witnessing a hara-kiri:Tales of Old Japan by Algernon Bertram Freeman-Mitford > As a corollary to the above elaborate statement of the ceremonies proper to > be observed at the harakiri, I may here describe an instance of such an > execution which I was sent officially to witness.

In modern Japan Seppuku as judicial punishment was abolished in 1873, shortly after the Meiji Restoration, but voluntary seppuku did not completely die out. Dozens of people are known to have committed seppuku since then, including General Nogi and his wife on the death of Emperor Meiji in 1912, and numerous soldiers and civilians who chose to die rather than surrender at the end of World War II. The practice had been widely praised in army propaganda, which featured a soldier captured by the Chinese in the Shanghai Incident (1932) who returned to the site of his capture to perform seppuku. In 1944, Hideyoshi Obata, a Lieutenant General in the Imperial Japanese Army, committed seppuku in Yigo, Guam, following the Allied victory over the Japanese in the Second Battle of Guam. Obata was posthumously promoted to the rank of general. Many other high-ranking military officials of Imperial Japan would go on to commit seppuku towards the later half of World War II in 1944 and 1945, as the tide of the war turned against the Japanese, and it became clear that a Japanese victory of the war was not achievable. In 1970, author Yukio Mishima and one of his followers performed public seppuku at the Japan Self-Defense Forces headquarters following an unsuccessful attempt to incite the armed forces to stage a coup d'√©tat. Mishima performed seppuku in the office of General Kanetoshi Mashita. His second, a 25-year-old man named Masakatsu Morita, tried three times to ritually behead Mishima but failed, and his head was finally severed by Hiroyasu Koga, a former kendo champion. Morita then attempted to perform seppuku himself, but when his own cuts were too shallow to be fatal, he gave the signal and was beheaded by Koga. excerpt from Notable cases List of notable seppuku cases in chronological order. *Minamoto no Tametomo (1170) *Minamoto no Yorimasa (1180) *Minamoto no Yoshitsune (1189) *H≈çj≈ç Takatoki (1333) *Ashikaga Mochiuji (1439) *Azai Nagamasa (1573) *Oda Nobunaga (1582) *Takeda Katsuyori (1582) *Shibata Katsuie (1583) *H≈çj≈ç Ujimasa (1590) *Sen no Riky≈´ (1591) *Toyotomi Hidetsugu (1595) *Torii Mototada (1600) *Tokugawa Tadanaga (1634) *Forty-six of the Forty-seven r≈çnin (1703) *Watanabe Kazan (1841) *Tanaka Shinbei (1863) *Takechi Hanpeita (1865) *Yamanami Keisuke (1865) *Byakkotai (group of samurai youths) (1868) *Saig≈ç Takamori (1877) *Nogi Maresuke and Nogi Shizuko (1912) *Chujiro Hayashi (1940) *Seig≈ç Nakano (1943) *Yoshitsugu Sait≈ç (1944) *Hideyoshi Obata (1944) *Kunio Nakagawa (1944) *Isamu Ch≈ç and Mitsuru Ushijima (1945) *Korechika Anami (1945) *Takijir≈ç ≈ånishi (1945) *Yukio Mishima (1970) *Isao Inokuma (2001) In popular culture The expected honor-suicide of the samurai wife is frequently referenced in Japanese literature and film, such as in Taiko by Eiji Yoshikawa, Humanity and Paper Balloons, and Rashomon. Seppuku is referenced and described multiple times in the 1975 James Clavell novel, Sh≈çgun; its subsequent the 1980 miniseries Sh≈çgun brought the term and the concept to mainstream Western attention. It was staged by the young protagonist in the 1971 dark American comedy Harold and Maude. In The Last Samurai, a mortally wounded samurai leader Katsumoto performs seppuku with former US Army Captain Nathan Algren's help. This is also depicted en masse in the movie 47 Ronin starring Keanu Reeves when the 47 ronin are punished for disobeying the emperor's orders by avenging their master.(47 Ronin) In Season 15 Episode 12 of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, titled \\"Jersey Breakdown,\\" a Japanophile New Jersey judge with a large samurai sword collection commits seppuku when he realizes that the police are onto him for raping a 12-year-old Japanese girl in a Jersey nightclub. In the 2017 revival and final season of the animated series Samurai Jack, the eponymous protagonist, distressed over his many failures to accomplish his quest as told in prior seasons, is then informed by a haunting samurai spirit that he has acted dishonorably by allowing many people to suffer and die from his failures, and must engage in seppuku to atone for them.

It has been held in March annually since 1932. Each Boekenweek has a theme. The beginning of the Boekenweek is marked by the Boekenbal (book ball), a gathering that is attended by writers and publishers. Events are held across the country during the Boekenweek, such as book signing sessions, literary festivals and debates.  Publications  Hella Haasse, the only author who has written the Boekenweekgeschenk thrice, in 1948, 1959 and 1994. Each year a well-known writer, usually Dutch or Flemish, is asked to write a book, usually a novella, called the Boekenweekgeschenk (book week gift), which is to be given away during the festival. Book shops give a copy of the Boekenweekgeschenk when a customer buys a book in the Dutch language; libraries also give copies of these books when a new person becomes a member. The Boekenweekgeschenk is published by the Collectieve Propaganda van het Nederlandse Boek (CPNB, Collective Promotion for the Dutch Book). Some authors invited to write for this event have included Maarten 't Hart (1984), Hugo Claus (1989), Cees Nooteboom, and Harry Mulisch (2000). Boekenweekuitgaven en thema's vanaf 1930 , Collectieve Propaganda van het Nederlandse Boek In 2001, the Boekenweekgeschenk was originally written in English by Salman Rushdie and later translated into Dutch. In the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, the Boekenweekgeschenk was sometimes published anonymously, with a list of possible authors inside the book. Geschiedenis van de Boekenweek, Historiek, 10 March 2010 As a competition, readers could submit their guess by postcard as to who the author was. Since 2002, the Boekenweekgeschenk can be used as a ticket to travel for free by train with the Nederlandse Spoorwegen on the final Sunday of the Boekenweek. Since 1987, an essay, the Boekenweekessay, has been written in addition to the Boekenweekgeschenk. The Boekenweekessay can be purchased in book shops. Some authors include Jan Wolkers (1995), Gerrit Komrij (1997) and Adriaan van Dis (2004). The curriculum vitae of the author of the Boekenweekgeschenk ‚Äì called the Boekenweek-cv ‚Äì is distributed by public libraries among their members.

Publishers, booksellers and others interested in supporting books organized a longer event to promote Dutch literature. In 1932, the first Boekenweek was held and the first Boekenweekgeschenk was published. During World War II, the Boekenweek was not held in the years 1942 till 1945. In 1941, a Boekenweekgeschenk was published but it was withdrawn from the stores due to German occupation of the country. Despite competition from other media, including new technology since 1932, the Boekenweekgeschenk has grown in popularity over the years. In 2010, during the 75th Boekenweek, 958.000 copies of the Boekenweekgeschenk were produced.

The band was formed in 2002 by bassist Andrew Jacobs. Background=Formation, Signing to Roadrunner and debut album (2009-2010) They would go through a number of lineup changes and a name change before finally solidifying into the band they would eventually become. Jacobs recruited his younger brother, Brandon Jacobs, to play guitar, as well as drummer Bill Fore and keyboardist Drew Stavola. While searching for a singer, the band contacted Chris Clancy in England, based on a performance he posted on YouTube. Clancy moved to the United States and dedicated himself to the band. The final member, Daniel Bage, also came over from England when Clancy invited him to join the band in the studio to record some guitar solos. In 2010, Mutiny Within released their self-titled debut on Roadrunner Records. Their song \\"Born to Win\\" was the theme song to the WWE wrestler Evan Bourne for his entire WWE career (2008‚Äì2014). Roadrunner Records released a demo of their song \\"Awake\\" on their downloadable compilation album Annual Assault (2009). The song \\"Awake\\" was later released to Roadrunner subscribers and on iTunes for purchase. They also recorded another song called The End for the Roadrunner Records EP God of War: Blood & Metal. Their tours lined up included a North American summer tour supporting Soilwork with Death Angel running from July 14 through August 15, 2010. The band parted ways with drummer Bill Fore months after their self-titled debut album release. Bill Fore went on to play with former Black Market Hero guitarist and solo guitar instrumentalist Angel Vivaldi. Wishing him the best of luck on moving forward, he was temporarily replaced with 25-year-old Chad Anthony, who is also from New Jersey. Anthony learned all of the songs in only two weeks to be ready in time for the 2010 North American tour with Soilwork and Death Angel. They announced on September 20, 2010 that they needed to cancel their touring with Nevermore to do take the time to properly audition and rehearse for a new drummer. On October 5, 2010, they announced that they also cancelled their tour with Scar Symmetry and Epica, to concentrate on their new material for their second album and find a new permanent drummer instead of using yet another fill in drummer.  Departure of Chris Clancy, Planned Second Album and hiatus (2011)  On February 23, it was announced that the band had parted ways with Roadrunner Records. The band released a thirty-second trailer for a second album on YouTube. Although no official announcement has been made, Chad Anthony was listed on the band's MySpace as their drummer. Chris Clancy announced his departure from the band due to financial reasons on June 20, 2011, while Drew Stavola had apparently left the band earlier. The band is currently making a process on these changes. They also said that they will start the search for a new vocalist and new information of the upcoming album will be available soon. On October 11 the band announced via their Facebook that the band would take an indefinite hiatus due to the difficulties of finding a new vocalist. The statement was made by Bassist Andrew Jacobs: > It saddens us to announce today that we are taking an indefinite hiatus. > We've been searching the globe for a replacement vocalist for most of the > year, and we've come to a point where we simply can't afford to pass up > other opportunities any longer.

During the hiatus, Andrew Jacobs started the band Vext with ex-Snot/Divine Heresy singer Tommy Vext, as well as Bill Fore and guitar virtuoso Angel Vivaldi.  Album revival and Synchronicity (2012)  On January 31, 2012, the band posted YouTube links via Facebook for two unreleased demo tracks that were supposed to be on the second record, they are called In My Veins and Falls to Pieces. After a very good response the band said that they will probably put out more unreleased songs in the future. On July 5, 2012, Chris Clancy announced on his personal Facebook page that he would record vocals for several unfinished Mutiny Within tracks: > Next week I'm tracking vocals for the unreleased Mutiny Within tracks. Quite > excited about it after over a year of being sat on my hard drive doing > nothing! I've been working on making the instrumental versions for the last > week and they sound epic. Even though the band members remained quiet during most of 2012, members Chris Clancy and guitarist Brandon Jacobs worked together with Frederic Riverin with his solo work entitled I, Legion. This project also featured Bj√∂rn Strid & Peter Wichers (Soilwork), Jon Howard (Threat Signal), and Angel Vivaldi. The album Beyond Darkness, was released in September 2012. On September 29, 2012 the band posted the following on Facebook. > It's great to finally show you what we've been working on since our first > album. Share this with everybody you know, Chris, AJ, Brandon, Bill & Dan. Although no official announcement was made, this post confirmed that Bill Fore had re-joined the band. The title of the new album was announced as \\"Mutiny Within II: Synchronicity\\", with a release date of January 12, 2013. Clancy also set up a project called Industry Embers, an organisation dedicated to spread the word about music piracy. He revealed that music piracy had been the downfall of Mutiny Within, with the debut album only selling around 10,000 copies since released, and the album being shared and pirated at least 100,000 times. > \\"When Tommy Jones put to me the idea of Industry Embers, it was just a > concept.

On December 25, the band released another song \\"Machines\\" for streaming. In a Facebook update on January 21, 2013, the band released the following statement: \\"The response for our new album has been completely overwhelming, we are really speechless.

The original schools were Chadwell St Mary Primary School, Corringham Primary School, Grays Convent, Hassenbrook School, Herringham Primary School, Jack Lobley Primary School, Landsdowne Primary School, St Chad's Comprehensive School, Torrell's Comprehensive School, Tilbury Manor Infant School, Tilbury Manor Junior School, Tilbury St Mary's RC Primary School and Woodside Primary School. Schools outside of Chadwell St Mary or Tilbury were included either to add capacity or because a large number of their children came from the area. Jack Lobley school was closed in 2003 but the building was used for a while to house a cluster Inclusion Centre. St Chad's and Torrell's were also closed and reopened as one fresh start school; The Gateway Community College, which has since become The Gateway Academy but continues to have problems. Standards and attendance are still significantly below average. Excellence Clusters were originally given additional funding to development provisions over a four \\"strands\\": learning mentors, learning support units, gifted and talented and a tailored strand decided by each cluster which is in this case is school improvement.  Learning Mentors  Each cluster school had one or more learning mentors whose task was to overcome barriers to learning among children in the school. As well as working with individuals this has included proactive work to remove bullying and improve attendance.  Learning Support Units  The Gateway Academy had a unit within the school but there is a Learning Support Unit for the Primary Schools at Rainbow House on The Landsdowne site.  Gifted and Talented  Each school has a gifted and talented coordinator supported by the cluster who maintains a register of the gifted and talented children in their own school, tracking progress and promoting good practice in challenging the more able. The cluster also arranges special events such as the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra workshops for specifically talented children. Each cluster school has worked with a creative designer to establish a Link Gallery.Tilbury and Chadwell St Mary Excellence Cluster Annual Report 2007  School Improvement  This strand has focussed on developing the quality of teaching and learning throughout cluster schools with high quality professional development for staff and cluster wide monitoring and reporting.

His two sisters, Matilde and Santina, posed for several of his paintings. Expelled from school and considered incorrigible for drawing in his textbooks, Alice went to work as a shoeblack. At the age of 11, while sketching Gaucho portraits between shoe shines, he was discovered by Cupertino del Campo, who went on to become the Director of the National Museum of Fine Arts of Buenos Aires. Del Campo referred Alice to the painter, Decoroso Bonifanti who gave the boy his first painting lesson in 1897. In 1904, he was awarded the Prix de Rome (Premio Roma) and entered the Royal Academy of Painting in Turin, studying under Giacomo Grosso, Francisco Gilardi, and Andrea Tavernier.

This had no such mark on it, so she dared to taste it, and as she found it nice (it had, in fact, a taste of pie, ice-cream, roast fowl, and hot toast), she soon drank it off. Carroll's original There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (\\"which certainly was not here before,\\" said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words \\"DRINK ME\\" beautifully printed on it in large letters. It was all very well to say \\"Drink me\\", but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. \\"No, I'll look first,\\" she said, \\"and see whether it's marked 'poison' or not\\"; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked \\"poison\\", it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.

It won the 1993 American Book Award for ‚Äúexcellence in literature‚Äù. It is one of Rosca‚Äôs novels that recreated the diversity of Filipino culture (the other was State of War). Apart from tracing back Philippine History, Rosca also portrayed contemporary Philippine politics, delicate events, and cultural preferences through the novel. Description Twice Blessed was described as a ‚Äúcomic parable‚Äù concerned about the Philippines‚Äô status, at the time of writing, as ‚Äúa nation struggling to be born.‚Äù It was published when Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos were exiled in Hawaii, USA. In this satirical novel, Rosca derided the Marcoses and exposed how some moneyed Filipino warlords preserve their status and power through clan alliances, corruption, and ‚Äúfuel and favors‚Äù (i.e. bribery, sexual favors, and the like) generally known as gasolina in the vernacular meaning ‚Äúgasoline‚Äù to ‚Äúkeep things running‚Äù as planned. Characters The main characters in Twice Blessed are Hector Basbas, Katerina Basbas, and Teresa Tiklopluhod (her surname literally meant ‚Äúfold and kneel‚Äù in Tagalog). Hector and Katerina are twins having an incestuous relationship. Katerina had a shoe collection resulting from her experiences of ‚Äúhumiliations‚Äù during childhood. Teresa Tiklopluhod is a provincial governor‚Äôs daughter who became a confidante of Katerina Basbas. Description Through political tactics and societal manoeuvres, Hector and Katerina Basbas became dominant figures in the Philippines. When Hector won the Presidential elections by ‚Äúbuying‚Äù, the incumbent refused to relinquish the position. Hector needed to provide more ‚Äúfuel‚Äù to keep things moving, a plan that required Katerina‚Äôs help, covert assistance from the United States and ‚Äústrong-arm‚Äù persuasive manoeuvring. Together with Katerina, Hector was aiming to convert the Philippine democratic system into a dynastic reign of monarchs. Awards In 1993 the Before Columbus Foundation granted her the American Book Award, for excellence in literature, for her Twice Blessed. The Before Columbus Foundation seeks to recognize outstanding literary achievement by contemporary American authors, without restriction to race, sex, ethnic background, or genre. Author Ninotchka Rosca (born in the Philippines in 1946) is a Filipina feminist, author, journalist and human rights activist. Ninotchka Rosca is described as, \\"one of the major players in the saga of Filipina American writers\\". During the political instability during Ferdinand Marcos's rule she was arrested and held at a detention center for six months. She then spent sometime in exile in America. Much of her work is taken from her experiences during her imprisonment. Her short stories have been included in several collections including, the 1986 Best 100 Short Stories in the U.S. compiled by Raymond Carver and the Missouri Review Anthology. She went on to write Jose Maria Sison: At Home in the World, \\"To read Ninotchka Rosca's [latest is] not just to discover the controversial man, but to learn the political and economic history of the Philippines.\\" Bibliography ;Notes ;References  \\\\- Total pages: 269 * \\\\- Total pages: 608 Category:Novels by Ninotchka Rosca Category:1992 novels Category:Political novels Category:Novels set in the Philippines Category:W.

Early life Francis Cargeeg was born in Carnsew, Hayle, Cornwall. He was the second youngest of eight children born to William and Emma Cargeeg between 1878 and 1897. Frank's father was originally a miner seeking tin and copper in the hard rocks of the County. Subsequently, he moved up to the position of engine man (driver), initially at a mine and later at Harvey's of Hayle. Harvey's was an internationally known pumping engine and other mine goods manufacturer in the 19th century. After his initial schooling Frank became an apprentice at Holman's of Camborne, another internationally recognised company. He finished his 6-year apprenticeship in engineering on 2 December 1914. World War I changed the face of employment in UK at that time and Frank went to sea in the merchant marine as 4th engineer on the SS Trevalgan, one of the Hain Line ships. After just one voyage he left the vessel on medical grounds. Thereafter he became employed in HM Dockyard, Devonport. In 1939 he decided to leave his safe employment at this large facility and become self-employed as an artist in hand-beaten copper ware. Unfortunately, World War II intervened preventing him from carrying out his dream, instead he found himself employed in a new factory in Hayle producing dibromoethane, an additive used in petrol allowing higher compression ratios to be used in the most modern aircraft engines of the time - such as the Merlin. After the war he worked in Pool's of Hayle for a few years finally realising his dream of full-time employment in copperware in the late 1940s. At this time Cornwall had a history of copperware, beginning with Newlyn Copper in the late 19th century. At this time he lived with his wife, Winifred, whom he married in September 1919, and his unmarried sister Holly in her cottage, Trevean, at Mellanear Road, Hayle. Career Jar with lid For the next 30 years or so he worked from his small workshop here producing bowls, plates, mirror surrounds and vases in copper, using only hand tools and other simple equipment. All of his designs followed images based on the products of the ancient Celts ‚Äì particularly those of the La T√®ne Culture.Francis Cargeeg Cornwall Artists Index Between 1939 and 1970, Cargeeg was asked by the Gorseth Kernow to create most of the copper regalia they use, including the Grand Bard's Crown. The Grand Bards Crown was photographed and written about in the Western Morning News, 9 September 1940. Francis had been a member of the group since 1934. He became the group's Deputy Grand Bard in 1962, and held the position until 1967. He exhibited pieces at the Red Rose Guild in Manchester in 1950 and 1951. At St Ives in 1948, along with Barbara Hepworth, David Leach and Ben Nicholson. In the Newlyn Art Gallery in the late 1940s. Penlee House MuseumPenlee House Museum (Penzance, Cornwall) in early 2003, in a display arranged by J. Laity, covered in the Western Morning News on 4 March 2003. Additionally, the sale of one of his works was detailed in D Lays catalogue on 14 October 2003. Finally, A few articles were published by him including in the Cornish Review, Spring 1950, and the New Cornwall Volume 2, No. 5, in July and September 1963. A line attributed to Cargeeg helps explain the few works he produced: \\"I deliberately limit my output to a small range of styles and sizes in order that I can master my art.\\" Additionally, some of the complicated items took a year or more to make. His very best works, he was \\"loath to see them pass into other hands\\" (The West Briton 1970). As described in a West Briton interview \\"one fine vase, with separate moulded lid\\" (shown on this page) was kept part of his personal collection, and never sold (The West Briton 1970). The last few years of his life were non-productive due to the onset of age-related degeneration. He died on the 25 March 1981 and is buried in St Erth, Cornwall.

The shock occurred off the coast of Jalisco, Mexico, where a tsunami was triggered that affected a stretch of the coast. The earthquake could be felt in Mexico City and in high-rise buildings in Dallas and Houston. In Mexico, the Cihuatlan-Manzanillo was the most severely affected area. At least 49 people died and 100 were injured. Tectonic setting This earthquake occurred in the area where the Rivera Plate subducts beneath the North American Plate. It was the result of the relative movements between the North American Plate, the Rivera Plate, and the Cocos Plate. Damage Although the tsunami affected a 200 km stretch of coast, severe damage was confined to areas with shallow shoreline topography. Most of the flooding occurred in the Tenacatita Bay area. Landslides blocked roads between Guadalajara and Manzanillo. In Manzanillo, 18 people died in the collapse of an eight-story hotel. Characteristics=Earthquake The earthquake rupture lasted for about a minute and involved a 200 km long break along the plate boundary. The greatest displacement of the fault is about 5m. A 14 cm subsidence occurred at Manzanillo. The variations in observed seismic intensity indicate that three asperities were ruptured during this event. Tsunami The tsunami had a maximum run-up height of 5.1 m. There were at least two waves recorded. The tsunami was also observed in Ecuador, French Polynesia, Samoan Islands, Australia and Hawaii. Postseismic moment release The aftershocks of this earthquake marked a rectangular region of about 170 km by 70 km. Postseismic deformation has been recorded after the main shock. If the postseismic moment release up to about two weeks after the main shock is included, it will be equivalent to 35% of that of the main shock, which will make the additional seismic moment equivalent to that of an 7.7 earthquake.

Baillytown is a former community in northern Porter County, Indiana, near the present-day communities of Porter and Burns Harbor. Although the town platted as the Town of Bailly was never built, the Baillytown name was used for many years to refer to the area around the original Joseph Bailly trading post. The name continues today as the name of a subdivision, constructed in the 1990s, in the town of Porter. Baillytown began as a paper community, platted by Joseph Bailly in 1833 near his trading post on the Little Calumet River. Bailly had a group of French Canadians planning on settling in the dunes. When he became ill in 1835, he wrote to these families and recommended that they not journey to the shores of Lake Michigan. The development of a new settlement in the wilderness would be compounded by their lack of English and their lack of experience living among Indians.Administrative History of Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, National Park Service, Midwest Region; Omaha, Nebraska; 1989 In the 1830s, the Baillytown name was commonly used for the settlement around the Bailly trading post, which saw frequent visits from Potawatomi trading parties. Baillytown was on a northern branch of the Sauk Trail, and was also accessible from Lake Michigan via Petit Fort. When stagecoach traffic began in 1833, Baillytown was the last stop before Chicago, a journey that could take between six hours and six days depending on conditions. Subsequently, the Long Pole Bridge, a terrifying thousand-foot wooden bridge, was constructed just west of Baillytown to allow travelers to cross the Little Calumet inland. Swedish- American community In the 1850s, Baillytown became home to a growing Swedish-American community. It was originally populated by lumber workers who came to work in the sawmill operated by Bailly's son-in-law, and who later settled on farms in the area. An 1856 account reported about 20 Swedish families in the area, engaged in farming and logging. The immigrants were chiefly from √ñsterg√∂tland. Religious life in the town began with a visit by pioneer Swedish Lutheran minister Erland Carlsson around 1855. Carlsson reported \\"a good deal of apathy\\" toward religion in the community, but the Swedish Lutheran Church of Baillytown was organized in 1858 under the Augustana Synod. The church continues today as the Augsburg Evangelical Lutheran Church in Porter. The town's residents wanted to ensure that their children did not lose touch with Swedish language and culture. Consequently, a renovated toolshed, which had served as the town school from 1880 to 1885, was used until 1912 for Swedish language classes. A substantial Swedish community also developed in the nearby town of Chesterton, centered on the Hillstrom Organ factory. During this period, it is estimated that Westchester Township had the highest concentration of Swedes in Indiana. Legacy and present state In the early 20th century, the Baillytown name was used for a local school, and for a stop on the South Shore Line. One of eight one-room schools in Westchester Township, the Baillytown school was closed in the 1920s as part of the general consolidation of schools. Later, early meetings of the Save the Dunes Council were held in the Baillytown schoolhouse. Today, the French Canadian and Swedish legacies of Baillytown are commemorated by the Chellberg Farm area of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. It takes its name from the Chellberg (originally Kjellberg) family, who developed a farm on part of the old Bailly property in the 1870s.

The whole council was up for election with boundary changes since the last election in 2000 reducing the number of seats by 2. The Conservative party stayed in overall control of the council. Campaign All of the seats on the council were contested after boundary changes had reduced the number of seats from 55 to 53. Before the election the Conservatives ran the council with an overall majority of 1 seat. The Liberal Democrats were the main opposition on the council and contested 46 of the 53 seats. They attacked the Conservatives for increasing council tax since taking control in 2000, while cutting grants to various groups and moving the council offices to a rented site. The Conservatives however defended their record saying that the move in council offices would save money and that they had introduced a new bus pass allowing cheaper travel. Other issues raised in the election included social housing, the environment, speeding traffic and recycling. The results were counted electronically as part of a pilot scheme, while voters were able to use electronic voting in 140 electronic polling booths. This was expected to lead to results being declared much earlier than in many areas, with some expected within minutes of polls closing. However while turnout was quite high at around 40%, the results were delayed after the computers did not perform as well as expected. Election result The results saw the Conservatives retain an overall majority of just 1 seat on the council. They made gains in Ettington, Snitterfield and the new ward of Stockton and Napton, but lost seats in Studley and Harbury. The Liberal Democrats made gains primarily at the expense of independents, who lost the most seats in the election. Meanwhile, Labour retained their 2 seats in Southam, but failed to make any gains.
