He is famous for his rustic comedies, written mostly in the Paduan dialect of the Venetian language,And precisely in a now-dead form of it, called \\"dialetto pavano\\". featuring a peasant called \\"Ruzzante\\". Those plays paint a vivid picture of Paduan country life in the 16th century. Biography Born in Padua, Beolco was the illegitimate son of Giovan Francesco Beolco, a physician who occasionally worked at the University, and a certain Maria, possibly a maid. (It has been suggested, however, that his real name was Ruzzante, and that Beolco was a local corruption of bifolco, meaning \\"ploughman\\" ‚Äî by extension, \\"country simpleton\\".) Some claim that he was born in Pernumia, a small town near Padua.Rai International, Ruzzante: dalla \\"Pastoral\\" alla \\"Bet√¨a\\" alla \\"Prima orazione\\" (a biography of Ruzante, in Italian) Online version accessed on 2009-06-27. Angelo was raised in his father's household and there he received a good education. After Giovan Francesco's death in 1524, Angelo became manager of the family's estate, and later (1529) also of the farm of Alvise Cornaro, a nobleman who had retired to the Paduan countryside and who became his friend and protector. He developed his theatrical vocation by associating with contemporary Padua intellectuals, such as Pietro Bembo and Sperone Speroni. His first stints as an author and actor may have been mariazi, impromptu sketches delivered at marriage parties. In 1520, already known as il Ruzzante, he played a role in a peasant play at the Foscari Palace in Venice. Soon afterwards he put together his own theater troupe. His plays were staged first at Ferrara (1529‚Äì1532) and then at Padua, in Cornaro's residence. He died in Padua in 1542, while preparing to stage Speroni's play Canace, for the Accademia degli Infiammati. In spite of his success as an actor, he was very poor through most of his life. His friend Speroni remarked that while Angelo had unsurpassed understanding of comedy, he was unable to perceive his own tragedy. His work In his first printed play, La Pastoral, labeled \\"a rural comedy\\", he contrasts Arcadian shepherds who tell of their frustrated loves in affected tercets, with the peasants Ruzzante and Zilio, who deliver rustic verses in Venetian, generously spiced with vulgarities and obscenities (starting with Ruzante's very first word in the play).Nancy Dersofi (1996), Translating Ruzante's Obscenities. Text of the Translation Seminar Lecture delivered at Amherst in December 1996. Published in Metamorphoses Five College Faculty Seminar, issue 6.1, December 1997, p. 4‚Äì14. Online version accessed on 2009-06-27. Much of the play's comical effect comes from the contrast between the two languages, which provides the occasion for many misunderstandings and wordplays. Featured is also a physician, who earns the gratitude of Ruzzante for prescribing a fatal medicine to his stingy father and thus uniting the lad with his long-awaited inheritance. In his later plays and monologues he shifts to the Venetian language almost exclusively, while keeping up with his social satire. In the Oratione, a welcome speech for Bishop Marco Cornaro, he suggests several measures that the new prelate should consider for improving the peasants' life; such as either castrating the priests, or forcing them to marry ‚Äî for the peace of mind of the local men and their wives. Because of his \\"lascivious\\" themes and abundant use of \\"very dirty words\\" (in the evaluation of his contemporary critics), Beolco's plays were often considered unfit for educated audiences, and sometimes led to performances being canceled. On the other hand, his plays seem to have been well received by those rural nobles which had opposed the metropolitan nobility of Venice in the Cambraic Wars. Perhaps for that reason, none of his plays was staged at Venice after 1526. One of his best-known pieces is the short dialogue Il Parlamento de Ruzante, where the character tells of his return from the Venetian war front, only to find that he had lost his wife, land, and honor. Again, Ruzante's speech begins with his favorite expletive: Cancaro ai campi e √† la guera e ai sold√®, e ai sold√® e √† la guera! (\\"Rotten be the front and the war and the soldiers, and the soldiers and the war!\\") Modern studies have concluded that Ruzante's speech was not a linguistically accurate record of the local Paduan dialect of Venetian, but was to some extent a \\"theatrical dialect\\" created by Beolco himself. Italian playwright and 1997 Nobel laureate Dario Fo puts Ruzzante on the same level as Moli√®re, claiming that he is the true father of the Venetian comic theater (Commedia dell'Arte) and the most significant influence on his own work.

They continue this task today along with arranging public services (toilets, buses, security, medics) and scheduling live music and family-oriented games and contests.

Food and drinks are sold onsite by local Austin 501c-3 non-profit groups. Purified water is available onsite for participants to fill their own containers. Due to the lack of parking in the area and the high attendance, the Friends of the Forest Foundation provides festive shuttle buses between state parking lots just north of the capitol building and Pease Park. Singing of folk and road trip songs is encouraged on the short bus ride. Eeyore's Birthday Party is attended by people from a wide variety of backgrounds and ages, some of whom may have been attending for decades.

Gentile appeared for Italy in two World Cup tournaments, and played for the winning Italian team in the 1982 final. His club career was notably spent with Juventus for whom he made almost 300 league appearances, winning six national titles and two major European trophies. Club career He was born in Tripoli, Libya, but came to Italy as a child. After beginning his career with Arona, Gentile played in Serie B with Varese during the 1972‚Äì73 season. Gentile playing for Juventus in 1975 He then moved to Juventus and first played for them in a Coppa Italia match against Ascoli Calcio on 29 August 1973, with his Serie A debut following on 2 December 1973 against Verona. In all he played 414 senior matches for Juventus, including 283 in Serie A. In over a decade with Juventus, Gentile won two major European club competitions (1976‚Äì77 UEFA Cup and 1983‚Äì84 European Cup Winners' Cup), six Serie A championships, and two Coppa Italias. He also reached the final of the 1982‚Äì83 European Cup with the Turin club, only to suffer a 1‚Äì0 defeat against Hamburg in Athens. In 1984, he moved to rivals Fiorentina where he spent three further seasons in Serie A, making over 60 appearances for the club. He then played a final season with Piacenza, in Serie B, retiring at the end of the 1987‚Äì88 season. International career Gentile was capped on 71 occasions by Italy between 1975 and 1984, scoring a single goal during his international career. He played in all of Italy's matches at the 1978 World Cup, where Italy finished in fourth place, after reaching second place in the final group stage of the tournament and then losing the 3rd place playoff to Brazil. Gentile also played in the 1980 European Championship, and he was named in the team of the tournament. In the 1982 World Cup, Gentile was once again a permanent member of the starting line-up as Italy went on to win the World Cup that year. He gained notoriety for his aggressive man-marking of Diego Maradona in a 2‚Äì1 second-round victory against Argentina at the 1982 World Cup, where he fouled the Argentine star 11 times in the first half, and 23 in total, after which Gentile famously quipped, \\"Football is not for ballerinas!\\" Italy ending up defeating the defending champions Argentina 2‚Äì1. Italy then faced tournament favorites Brazil in the next second-round group match and won 3‚Äì2. Paolo Rossi had a hat trick. Italy defeated Poland 2‚Äì0 in the semi-final, and Gentile returned for the final against West Germany where Italy won 3‚Äì1. Gentile was once again in the team of the tournament for his performances during the 1982 World Cup. Style of play A tough, strong, tenacious, ruthless, and uncompromising defender, Gentile was regarded as one of the best defenders of his generation, one of the toughest ever players in his position, and as one of the greatest Italian defenders of all time. A hard-tackling and versatile defender, he was capable of playing both as a man-marking centre- back or \\"stopper\\", and as a full-back on either flank, and was particularly known for his tight, heavy, physical marking of opponents, as well as his work-rate, and aggressive challenges. He was also capable of playing as a sweeper, a role which he occupied towards the end of his career, as he lost some of his pace, or in the centre of the pitch as a defensive midfielder. He also stood out for his ability in the air. Although he was not initially known to be the most naturally talented footballer from a skilful standpoint, and was seen as more of a defensive-minded right-back, who mainly sought to break down opposing attacks, he was known for his discipline in training, and showed significant technical improvements throughout his career. Indeed, he was a mobile and hard-working player, who was also capable of contributing offensively as an attacking full-back in a zonal-marking system, by getting up the flank and providing deliveries into the box for his teammates. Alongside Juventus and Italy teammates Dino Zoff, Brio, Cabrini, and Scirea, he formed one of the most formidable defensive lines in football history. In 2007, The Times placed Gentile at number 8 in their list of the 50 hardest footballers in history. However, despite his infamous reputation, Gentile considered himself to be a hard yet fair player. He was only sent off once in his career, with Juventus, in a 2‚Äì0 away loss to Club Brugge in a European Cup match in April 1978, for a double booking following a hand ball. Due to his aggressive playing style and country of birth, Gentile was given the nickname Gaddafi in the Italian media. Coaching career Gentile later coached the Italy national under-21 football team which won the 2004 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship, and the under-23 team which won a bronze at the 2004 Olympics in Athens. On 5 June 2014 he signed two-year deal with FC Sion.

As the baby boomer generation came of age during the 1960s and 1970s, off-road motorcycling experienced a boom in popularity. Cooper sought to fill a void in the motorcycle marketplace between the less expensive, entry level Japanese motorcycles and the more expensive European motorcycles. Cooper contracted with Isidro Lopez, the owner of a Mexican moped manufacturer named Moto Islo, to build motocross and enduro motorcycles to Cooper's specifications. Using engine parts made in Italy and later, engines made by Sachs, Cooper imported the motorcycles into the United States and sold them as Cooper motorcycles beginning in early 1973. Cooper produced an Enduro 250 cc model designed by Malcolm Smith using an engine based on a Yamaha two-stroke engine in addition to other bikes. Although the motorcycles were initially well received, they soon developed a reputation for poor quality due to metallurgy failures, poor quality fiberglass parts and deficient quality control during the manufacturing process. Although Cooper addressed most of the reliability issues, the brand's poor reputation persisted. Cooper was also unable to manufacture motorcycles at prices low enough to compete against Japanese motorcycle manufacturers. The combination of a poor reputation along with a higher than anticipated price caused the company to cease operations after producing approximately 1,200 motorcycles. At least one motorcycle dealer/distributor did well with the Cooper brand. FreeWheeler Motors of Coeburn, Virginia bought over 50 of the motorcycles for both retail sales and wholesale distribution to other dealers in the early 1970s. The dealership fielded a motocross team riding Coopers and competed in the 250cc class with considerable success. The owner of FreeWheeler Motors, B.V. Cooper (no relation to Frank Cooper) was a mechanical engineer and former motorcycle racer. He and his shop manager, Danny Bolling, made several modifications to the motorcycles to improve durability and performance, resulting in the shop's team winning several trophies. Buyout and rebranding The Cooper motorcycle brand was then purchased by Southern California Yamaha distributor, Don Jones who renamed the brand Ammex. Their intent was to achieve sales success by having Jones' son, three-time motocross national champion Gary Jones compete aboard the motorcycles. The Jones family significantly improved the Ammex over the previous Cooper model. Jones competed on an Ammex motorcycle during the 1976 250cc motocross national championship with his best result being a 10th place at the Sears Point race. However, the brand failed when the Mexican peso was devalued in 1976. Moto Islo Moto Islo also made a trials motorcycle from 1971 to 1975 called GRM (Grapevine Racing Motors) that was imported to the United States, for Bill Grapevine, who designed the bike. The Islo manufacturing facilities and name were bought by Honda around 1982. Since 2000, the brand has resurfaced in the Mexican market under the ownership of Moto Road S.A. de C.V.; the same company that currently owns the Carabela motorcycle brand.

It is located south of Stettler and north of Drumheller on Highway 56 in the County of Stettler No. 6.  History = Ranching era  Big Valley Alberta began to be settled even before 1910; people realized the value of the rich soil and natural grass known as Prairie Wool. Settlers began cattle farming operations and the town expanded. The Imperial Lease of land south-east of Big Valley consisted of thousands of acres of land owned by Pat Burns. Most of the land became an ecological reserve to preserve its natural flora.  Rail era  In 1911 the Canadian Northern Railway (CNR) began to lay track through Big Valley. In 1912 Big Valley built a thriving terminal with a big roundhouse, stockyards, rail yards, water tower, coal-dock, general railway maintenance and repair facilities. It became a village in 1914 with a population of 500 growing to 803 in 1920 when it became a town. After the merger of Canadian Northern Railway and Grand Trunk Pacific railways to create Canadian National Railway (CNR) they believed there was no need of a railway to go through Big Valley. There are still the remains of the railway you can see with a walking self-tour. In November 1986 Central Western Railway Corp. (later Railink) purchased the portion of CNR track from Ferlow Junction (seven miles south of Camrose) to Munson Junction (about seven miles (11 km) north of Drumheller). They began to haul grain along these lines from elevator to elevator on a regular basis. Railink has sold most of the line to a salvage company and now the tracks extend from Stettler to Big Valley. This remaining portion is owned by a group named the East Central Alberta Heritage Society (ECHAC). Alberta Prairie Steam Tours (a Stettler-based group) rents the use of the track, from ECHAC, for their steam train excursions. Steam Train at Station Waiting to depart  Coal era  Early explorers discovered coal along the dramatic cut banks of the Red Deer River--about west of Big Valley. Several small mines were later developed on the outskirts of Big Valley; but the largest of these many mines (Big Valley Collieries) opened in 1912. Located about north of Big Valley, it employed over 100 men and had its own school and hotel. Big Valley coal was all of a softer variety, suitable only for residential heating. The demand for this soft coal remained strong for many years and the mines continued to operate almost up to the time that gas and oil was discovered in Big Valley in 1950. The last local mine located north of the town was a \\"Strip Mine\\" which closed in 1952.  Oil boom  Up until the early 1950s, coal had been the commodity mined in the area. In the late 1940s, a blizzard in the Alberta foothills pushed the seismic operations eastward to Stettler. The move resulted in the discovery of oil near Big Valley. But more importantly, it spawned extensive oil and gas exploration throughout the county. That exploration resulted in the Big Valley No. 7 discovery well the following year, located south of Big Valley, Alberta. This well was completed in September 1950. Once developed, the Fenn-Big Valley field covered an area of 78.2 hectares (30.2 square miles). This field produced over 51 million cubic metres (321 million barrels) of oil and over 2.4 billion cubic metres (85 billion cubic feet) of solution gas. Small amounts of oil and gas remain to be produced from this field. The oil and gas formation lies 1660 metres (5,445 ft) below the surface of the ground. At its peak, the Fenn-Big Valley Field produced 5,352 cubic metres (35,000 barrels) of oil a day for Gulf and similar amounts for Shell and Esso. The original portion of No. 7 well alone produced 95,700 cubic metres (626,000 barrels) of oil during its lifetime. Today, many of the pump jacks that dot the Big Valley landscape stand idle. A local symbol of the importance of the petroleum industry is an oil pumper displayed in Memorial Park.  Historical places  St. Edmund's Church St. Edmund's Anglican Church on the hill (the Blue Church) was built in 1916. It was started by a financial gift from Mrs. Caroline Leffler (in England) who raised the $500.00 down payment by making, and selling, children's clothing. She sent the money to the Anglican Diocese in Calgary, asking that it be used to help start an Anglican church anywhere in western Canada that they saw fit. At that time Big Valley, with its booming mining, ranching, and railroading industries in full swing, made it a logical spot for a new church. Walter Dennis, a local craftsman, built St. Frances Museum. The building contains the original pews (with a few additions), pump organ, and other furnishings. The last regular church service was held in the 1960s and the building soon became very weather-worn. A nearly broke Homecoming 1974 group obtained some unclaimed blue paint from a local lumber yard and the once cream-coloured church became blue. Jimmie Jock Boardwalk Jimmie Jock Boardwalk The Jimmy Jock Boardwalk is named after a Chinese restaurateur, named Jimmy Jock, who ran a restaurant on that site, for many years, until he died. The building was torn down and the space remained empty for many years, until 1992 when a couple of local entrepreneurs came up with the Boardwalk concept. Today it houses many unique little shops and displays for locals and tourists to enjoy.

U.S. District Court, 407 U.S. 297 (1972), also known as the Keith case, was a landmark United States Supreme Court decision that upheld, in a unanimous 8-0 ruling, the requirements of the Fourth Amendment in cases of domestic surveillance targeting a domestic threat. The United States charged John Sinclair, Lawrence 'Pun' Plamondon, and John Forrest with conspiracy to destroy government property. One of the defendants, Lawrence 'Pun' Plamondon, was also charged with the dynamite bombing of an office of the Central Intelligence Agency in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The defendants were leaders of the radical White Panther Party. In response to a pretrial motion by the defense for disclosure of all electronic surveillance information, Nixon's attorney general, John Mitchell, claimed he authorized the wiretaps pursuant to Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 and was not required to disclose the sources. Though warrantless, the act allows for an exception to prevent the overthrow of the government and when \\"any other clear and present danger to the structure or existence of the Government\\" exists. The Government contended that since the defendants were members of a domestic organization attempting to subvert and destroy it, this case fell under the exception clause. After reading the briefs and hearing oral arguments by Constitutional attorney Hugh M. \\"Buck\\" Davis, Judge Damon Keith of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan disagreed and ordered the Government to disclose all of the illegally intercepted conversations to the defendants. The Government appealed, filing a petition for a writ of mandamus with the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit to set aside the order. The Sixth Circuit also rejected the Government's arguments and upheld the lower court decision. The decision The Supreme Court upheld the prior rulings in the case, holding that the wiretaps were an unconstitutional violation of the Fourth Amendment and as such must be disclosed to the defense. This established the precedent that a warrant needed to be obtained before beginning electronic surveillance even if domestic security issues were involved. Note that the decision applied only to domestic issues; foreign intelligence operations were not bound by the same standards. The governing law for electronic surveillance of \\"foreign intelligence information\\" between or among \\"foreign powers\\" is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 1978. Quotations * The price of lawful public dissent must not be a dread of subjection to an unchecked surveillance power. Nor must the fear of unauthorized official eavesdropping deter vigorous citizen dissent and discussion of Government action in private conversation. For private dissent, no less than open public discourse, is essential to our free society.; Lewis Powell, writing for the Majority. * \\"As I read it - and this is my fear - we are saying that the President, on his motion, could declare - name your favorite poison - draft dodgers, Black Muslims, the Ku Klux Klan, or civil rights activists to be a clear and present danger to the structure or existence of the Government.\\"; Senator Philip A. Hart, quoted by Lewis Powell, writing for the Majority. * History abundantly documents the tendency of Government - however benevolent and benign its motives - to view with suspicion those who most fervently dispute its policies. Fourth Amendment protections become the more necessary when the targets of official surveillance may be those suspected of unorthodoxy in their political beliefs. The danger to political dissent is acute where the Government attempts to act under so vague a concept as the power to protect \\"domestic security.\\" Given the difficulty of defining the domestic security interest, the danger of abuse in acting to protect that interest becomes apparent.; Lewis Powell, writing for the Majority. * This is an important phase in the campaign of the police and intelligence agencies to obtain exemptions from the Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment. For, due to the clandestine nature of electronic eaves-dropping, the need is acute for placing on the Government the heavy burden to show that \\"exigencies of the situation [make its] course imperative.\\" Other abuses, such as the search incident to arrest, have been partly deterred by the threat of damage actions against offending officers, the risk of adverse publicity, or the possibility of reform through the political process. These latter safeguards, however, are ineffective against lawless wiretapping and \\"bugging\\" of which their victims are totally unaware. Moreover, even the risk of exclusion of tainted evidence would here appear to be of negligible deterrent value inasmuch as the United States frankly concedes that the primary purpose of these searches is to fortify its intelligence collage rather than to accumulate evidence to support indictments and convictions. If the Warrant Clause were held inapplicable here, then the federal intelligence machine would literally enjoy unchecked discretion.; William O. Douglas, in a concurring opinion. * Here, federal agents wish to rummage for months on end through every conversation, no matter how intimate or personal, carried over selected telephone lines, simply to seize those few utterances which may add to their sense of the pulse of a domestic underground.; William O. Douglas, in a concurring opinion. * We are told that one national security wiretap lasted for 14 months and monitored over 900 conversations.

The synagogue is one of the two oldest Jewish congregations in Connecticut and one of the largest Reform Jewish congregations in New England, with about 900 member families and about 2,000 individual members. Its 1933 building, Temple Beth Israel, was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Beth Israel serves as a center for worship, education, and social programs.  Location  Congregation Beth Israel is located at 701 Farmington Ave in West Hartford, Connecticut. The congregation occupies a large building dominated by an enormous Byzantine dome. Inside are a sanctuary (upon which the dome is built), a chapel, a religious school, a pre-school, offices, two meeting halls, a small museum, and a library. Beautiful stained glass windows are present in both the sanctuary and the chapel. The building has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places by the U.S. government. The congregation worships in a notable 1936 building by architect Charles R. Greco. Built at the height of the Art Deco period, the Byzantine revival form in Art Deco style presents a majestic appearance. In 2006, the congregation was given the West Hartford Historic Preservation Award for its meticulous restoration of the historic structure.  History = Founding and affiliation  Beth Israel, which means \\"House of Israel\\" in Hebrew, was founded in 1843, the year the Connecticut legislature first permitted public worship by Jews in the state. Congregation Mishkan Israel was founded in the same year.Olitzky, Kerry M.; Raphael, Marc Lee. The American Synagogue: A Historical Dictionary and Sourcebook, Greenwood Press, June 30, 1996, pp. 76-80. Congregation Beth Israel began as an Orthodox congregation, however, in part influenced by the immigration of German Jews to Hartford, the congregation quickly adopted Reform practices. In 1877, it joined with other American Reform Jewish congregations to form the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (which is now known as the Union for Reform Judaism), an umbrella support organization for American Reform Jewish congregations. Beth Israel continues to be a member of the Union for Reform Judaism.  First synagogue  Congregation Beth Israel's first synagogue was built at 21 Charter Oak Ave. in Hartford in 1876. Though Beth Israel left the building in 1936, the building still stands and is occupied by the Charter Oak Cultural Center. It is among the oldest synagogue buildings still standing in the United States.Rediscovering Jewish Infrastructure: Update on United States Nineteenth Century Synagogues, Mark W. Gordon, American Jewish History 84.1 (1996) 11-27 . 2019 article update.  Rabbi Feldman  Beth Israel moved into its present location in 1936. For most of the middle of the 20th century (1925‚Äì1977), the congregation was led by Rabbi Abraham Feldman, a leading exponent of Classical Reform philosophy. One of the innovations that Rabbi Feldman brought to Congregation Beth Israel was the confirmation ceremony at age 16. Feldman's influence was far reaching. He fostered a sense of community and was held in great respect by most, if not all, of the congregation. He focused on building a congregation that people stayed in for a long time and celebrated all their life events as a congregation. His long service as Rabbi meant that many people were born, confirmed, and married under his leadership. Indeed, even at the beginning of the 21st century, a number of older congregants would use his leadership and rabbinate as an example.  Rabbi Silver  Rabbi Harold Silver succeeded Feldman in 1968. He would serve as senior rabbi for 25 years, retiring in 1993. Silver came from a family of rabbis. Five generations of his family before him served as rabbis. His father, Maxwell Silver, was a rabbi in New York City; his uncle, Abba Hillel Silver, was a rabbi in Cleveland, Ohio; and his grandfather, Moses Silver, was a rabbi in Jerusalem. Silver was ordained in 1951 at Hebrew Union College in New York City. Rabbi Silver's first rabbinate was as assistant rabbi at the Rodef Shalom Congregation in Pittsburgh. He went on to become rabbi at Temple Emanuel in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he served from 1955 until he came to Congregation Beth Israel in 1968. Silver was prominent in the Hartford Jewish community. He organized the first Greater Hartford Rabbinical Board of Rabbis, which brought together rabbis from different Jewish congregations and movements. He also served on a variety of community boards, both Jewish and non-Jewish. Silver also promoted cross-religious interfaith dialogue, preaching at many local churches and encouraging peace and understanding between people of different faiths. Additionally, Silver taught Judaism courses at local universities. Rabbi Silver retired in 1993 became rabbi emeritus (see Leadership). He passed away on March 9, 2017 at 92 years of age.  Rabbi Glaser  Silver was succeeded by Rabbi Simeon Glaser, who has served as assistant rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel at the end of Rabbi Silver's tenure as senior rabbi. Glaser was particularly popular with young families and children because of his love, and evident talent, for music and song. Glaser put on exciting Purim and Simchas Torah holiday services in which he would team up with Cantor Green and Assistant Rabbi Weiss to sing, dance, and act out the stories of the holidays. After serving four years as senior rabbi, Glaser left Beth Israel, first to serve at a small Conservative synagogue in Wethersfield, Connecticut and then to Temple Israel in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  Soviet immigration  During the 1990s, Congregation Beth Israel became instrumental in the absorption of hundreds of Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Early on, the New American Committee was formed to provide education assistance, licensure help, clothing acquisition assistance and help with the home needs of the new Americans. The New American Committee also continues to provide educational opportunities including lectures and weekly language classes (see Education). Congregation Beth Israel now has a large Russian speaking population and immigrants make up a significant demographic of the congregation.  Rabbi Fuchs  Rabbi Stephen Fuchs became senior rabbi in 1997 (see Leadership).  Leadership  Congregation Beth Israel, like most American Jewish congregations, is led by both a lay board and clergy.  Clergy  Beth Israel has long had a clergy system consisting of a senior rabbi, an assistant rabbi, and a cantor. Occasionally, this system has changed to better reflect realities of the offices, such as when Rabbi Weiss held the title of assistant rabbi, then associate rabbi, and then simply rabbi (with no qualification) after serving the congregation for many years from the late 1990s until early the early 2000s. Additionally, the congregation now has the position of rabbi emeritus, occupied by the previous senior rabbi, Harold Silver. Rabbi Stephen Lewis Fuchs became Rabbi Emeritus in 2011 when he was named President of the World Union of Progressive Judaism. He had been senior rabbi since 1997, having previously served as senior rabbi of the Temple Congregation Ohabai Sholom in Nashville, Tennessee for 11 years. Rabbi Fuchs is the author of six books and is currently the spiritual leader of Bat Yam Temple of the Islands. in Sanibel Island, FL. Michael Pincus is the current senior rabbi. Andi Fliegel is the current assistant rabbi. Stephanie Kupfer is the current cantor.  Lay leadership  The lay leadership of Congregation Beth Israel set policy, hires clergy, and oversees the running of the congregation. The governing body is the board of trustees, which consists of approximately 30 active members of the congregation. The head of the board is the president, who is assisted by a number of vice-presidents, a treasurer, and a secretary. Additionally, the brotherhood president, sisterhood president, young families chair, youth group president, and the clergy sit on the board but mostly in an ex-officio capacity. = Officers = The officers of the board of trustees are the president, vice-presidents, treasurer, and secretary. The president is the head of the board of trustees and the lay leader of Congregation Beth Israel. It is his job to make sure the congregation continues to run smoothly and to spearhead any new projects that become necessary. The vice-presidents assist the president. At any given time there are usually between three and five vice-presidents. Usually vice-presidents are long standing members of the board of trustees who have been particular active, often as committee chairs. It is common for vice-presidents to eventually become president, and they are often chosen to be vice-president with this in mind. The treasurer is in charge of the finances and the secretary takes minutes at the meetings. = Committees = The board of trustees has a number of committees that manage different aspects of the congregation. Some important committees include the Finance Committee, the Ritual Committee, and the Social Action Committee.  Worship = General practices  Worship at Congregation Beth Israel follows Reform Jewish practices. Men and women sit and pray together. The service usually follows a variant on the traditional Jewish service, usually mixing English and Hebrew (the English usually, but not always, reflecting at least the meaning if not a literal translation of the Hebrew). Services usually use the Gates of Prayer, the New Union Prayer Book or the book, though occasionally the clergy will write or adapt another service.  Worship times  The most popular regular service is the Friday night Shabbat service. It takes place in the sanctuary and is led by the clergy. Occasionally during the summer the service takes place outside instead. Over 100 people regularly attend these services. The congregation also has Saturday morning Shabbat services, also in the sanctuary and led by the clergy. Usually the services follow Torah study, which takes place at the synagogue and is led by the clergy (see Education). Beth Israel, like most Jewish congregations has special services for holidays. Hundreds of people annually attend the Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur services. A daily minyan service is held in the chapel and is usually led by a lay person, though occasionally the clergy will lead. Students of the Youth Education Program also attend a student and parent service on Sunday mornings in the chapel.  Innovations  Congregation Beth Israel has added a few innovations to services: #A monthly Friday night Shabbat family service that is aimed at children and young families. #Rabbi Stephen Fuchs has initiated an alternative Yom Kippur service, in addition to the regular service, in order to better serve the modern congregation. #One service a month using the older New Union Prayer (as opposed to the newer Gates of Prayer) in order to better serve the members who preferred the earlier book. #On June 28, 2019, Congregation Beth Israel held their first Pride Shabbat service.  Education = General  Beth Israel has educational opportunities for all ages and types of congregants. The cantor holds the role of director of education.  Youth Education Program  The Youth Education Program is for children preschool through 7th grade. It teaches Jewish values, history, and traditions. Additionally, conversational Hebrew and prayer reading in Hebrew is taught. Students also attend Sunday morning services where they learn basic Jewish prayers.  La'atid: Learning For Life  La'atid is a lifelong learning program for families and adults, the point of which is to continue Jewish education and promote knowledge and spirituality.  Noah's Ark  Noah's Ark was Congregation Beth Israel's pre-school and early care and education program. In early 2014, the Congregation established a Task Force to find a solution to the financial challenge of the program and still allow for the continuation of quality childcare. Educational Playcare, a Connecticut-based provider of childcare and pre-school programs, became the new provider of child care programs in June 2014.  Torah study  Beth Israel holds weekly Torah study at the synagogue, usually just prior to Saturday morning Shabbat services (see Worship). About 20-30 congregants participate each week and the session last about an hour. Torah study sessions are led by a rabbi at Beth Israel.  New American education  The New American Committee provides educational opportunities including lectures and weekly language classes to Soviet immigrants (see History).  Ellen Jeanne Goldfarb Community Learning Center  Funded with the help of private donors, the Jewish Federation of Greater Hartford and the Hartford Foundation of Public Giving, the Ellen Jeanne Goldfarb Community Learning Center opened in April, 2008.  Facilities  The new learning center has a number of facilities, including the Deborah Library, which boasts over 13,000 lendable volumes, the Miller Media Center, a children's room, and the Abraham J. Feldman Museum and Archives where artifacts are stored from the past 160 years.

According to his obituary in The Guardian newspaper, \\"For a time Hilton was a star ‚Äì strictly for home consumption ‚Äì with nine Top 20 hits between 1954 and 1957, that transitional era between 78 and 45rpm records. A quarter of a century later he became the voice of BBC Radio 2's Sounds of the Fifties series\\". A true Yorkshireman, Hilton always remained loyal to his roots ‚Äì especially to Leeds United. He composed, sang and recorded several anthems as tribute to the club. Biography Born Adrian Hill in Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, England, Hilton left school at 14 and worked in an aircraft factory at the beginning of the Second World War, then was part of the Highland Light Infantry. Following demobilisation in 1947, he became a fitter in a Leeds sewing plant. Career He started singing professionally under his adopted name in 1954 after leaving his safe job in the Leeds based engineering factory. He came to fame by supplying smoothly delivered cover versions of popular American songs during the 1950s. His most enduring recordings were \\"No Other Love\\"; and his last chart entry in 1965 with \\"A Windmill in Old Amsterdam\\" written by Ted Dicks and Myles Rudge. The latter spent a total of 13 weeks on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at No. 23 in the chart of 17 February 1965. The song's composers were granted an Ivor Novello Award in 1966 for the Year‚Äôs Outstanding Novelty Composition. Despite the prominence of rock and roll in his recording career, he amassed a formidable array of best-sellers in the UK Singles Chart, albeit mainly with cover versions of US hit records. This was common practice at the time, and many British recording artists followed this trend. His chart single recording career alone spanned from 1954 to 1965, which flew in the face of the rapidly changing trends of pop music. From a comparatively unknown Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, \\"Me and Juliet\\" written in 1953, Ronnie Hilton took the hit tune \\"No Other Love\\", and scored his one and only UK Number One hit in 1956. In securing the Number One, Hilton fought off competition from the UK- based Canadian Edmund Hockridge, and from the Johnston Brothers. Oddly, no American versions of \\"No Other Love\\" reached the UK Singles Chart at the time. Perry Como had been very successful with the song in America, but his version was released much earlier in 1953, when \\"Me and Juliet\\" first opened on Broadway. Nevertheless, Hilton's light operatic style, similar to fellow Hullensian, David Whitfield, was already by the mid-1950s being overtaken by events. By the time \\"No Other Love\\" dropped off the UK Singles Chart, Elvis Presley had clocked up his first three UK hit singles. Hilton also performed in three Royal Variety Performances. He also took part in the inaugural A Song For Europe contest in 1957, failing in his attempt to be the UK's first representative in the Eurovision Song Contest. Hilton's last chart hit for almost five years, in 1959, was \\"The Wonder of You\\"; the same song that Elvis Presley topped the UK chart with in 1970. Hilton kept on performing well into the 1960s, in summer seasons and Christmas shows, and was also a regular fixture in pantomimes in Hull, at the New Theatre, but knew that his chart days were behind him. In 1967 he released a single with covers of \\"If I Were a Rich Man\\" and \\"The Laughing Gnome\\" on the A-side and B-side respectively. It did not chart. In 1968, he participated in a successful album of songs from the then newly released film, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. This was issued on the budget Music For Pleasure label, and was his only charting album. He appeared as a guest on the BBC's Morecambe & Wise Show in June 1971. Hilton suffered a stroke in 1976, which hindered his progress for a time. He also encountered financial problems. Following his recovery, he presented Sounds of the Fifties, a nostalgic radio series for BBC Radio 2. The British Academy of Song Composers and Authors honoured him with its gold medal for services to popular music in 1989. He died in Hailsham, East Sussex from another stroke, aged 75. He was twice married. He had three children (Geraldine, Jane and Derry) with his first wife, Joan. She died in 1985. He was married to Christine Westoll from 1989 to 2001; together they had a son, Simon (born in 1966 during their earlier affair).

He was the brother of celebrated Revolutionary war hero John Stark. Early life Stark was born in Londonderry, New Hampshire. He was with his brother John Stark, David Stinson and Amos Eastman, hunting along the Baker River, a tributary of the Pemigewasset River, on 28 April 1752, when John Stark and Amos Eastman were captured and David Stinson was killed by Abenaki Indians. William escaped in his canoe after being warned by his brother. Career During the French and Indian War Stark commanded a company of Rogers' Rangers in northern New York and Nova Scotia where he served under James Rogers. He took part in the assaults on Fortress Louisbourg in 1758, the St. John River Campaign and Battle of the Plains of Abraham in 1759, where he served as a Major for General James Wolfe. In the painting by Benjamin West titled \\"The Death of General Wolfe\\"The Death of General Wolfe, Major William Stark is seen holding the mortally wounded General in cradle. Major William Stark was essential in the British triumph and was a pathfinder leading the Royal troops from riverside to the Field of Abraham, high above. Early in the American Revolution, Stark did not join the New Hampshire Militia forces in the Siege of Boston, but the sounds of the Battle of Bunker Hill could be heard at his home in Dunbarton, New Hampshire, and he left on his swiftest horse to fight, but he arrived too late and the battle had already ended. Both General John Sullivan and Colonel Jonathan Moulton recommended Stark to command the new regiment being raised in New Hampshire for service with the Continental Army in the invasion of Canada, but the New Hampshire General Assembly gave the command to Timothy Bedel, a former subordinate of Stark's. Stark, feeling ill-used by his home state, left for New York City, which was occupied by the British Army, and offered his services to them. The British made him a lieutenant colonel of Loyalist troops. Stark's property in New Hampshire was confiscated by the revolutionary government. Rick Holmes, of Derry News Aug 1, 2013, Derry, New Hampshire wrote: \\"William Stark was born in 1724 in a small house on Stark Road in Derry. In the 1750s, William moved to Starktown ‚Äî now Dunbarton, N.H. ‚Äî where his house was used as the meeting house for the next 17 years. On the frontier, the Stark brothers soon gained a reputation as skilled hunters and trappers who ranged all over New Hampshire and Quebec. While hunting in 1754, they were ambush by Indians. William managed to escape but his brother was taken prisoner. John was taken to Montreal where he was eventually ransomed for $103 ‚Äî the price of a pony. During the French and Indian War, William Stark was part of Rogers‚Äô Rangers ‚Äî colonial America‚Äôs greatest fighting force. William Stark was appointed captain and was second in command to the legendary Robert Rogers himself. During the next few years, he fought with bravery in many battles from Fortress Louisbourg in Cape Breton to Fort Ticonderoga in New York. William frequently traveled with his dog Beau de Bien, who drew full soldiers pay because of services as a scout and guard. William was assigned to go with Gen. James Wolfe to attack the French-held city of Quebec. The general could find no way to attack the French army, which was secure on top of the impenetrable cliffs looming high above the St. Lawrence River. One historian purports that it was Major William Stark who told Wolfe of the hidden path to the top of the cliff. The English went on to win the battle but Gen. Wolfe was critically wounded. Stark was one of the four officers who were assigned to carry Wolfe away from the fighting. In Benjamin West‚Äôs famous painting, ‚ÄúThe Death of General Wolfe,‚Äù it is believed that it‚Äôs William Stark cradling the dying general in a pose reminiscent of Christ in Michelangelo‚Äôs ‚ÄúPieta.‚Äù This battle resulted in England taking control of all of Canada. It is considered one of the most important battles in world history. After Quebec, William returned to his farm high on a ridge in Dunbarton. Here for the next 16 years, the soldier was at peace; here he and his wife raised seven children and took part in small-town politics. During the morning of April 17, 1775, he was startled to hear the distant sounds of cannon fire coming from 70 miles away at Bunker Hill outside of Boston. Immediately, he grabbed his musket, jumped on his horse and rode toward the fighting. By the time he arrived, the battle was over and he joined his brother John in Medford. William Stark was solidly on the patriot side and soon applied for command of an army to protect the northern border and capture the city of Quebec. Because of his experiences in the French and Indian War there was no one who more qualified for that position then Stark. The New Hampshire government saw fit however to award the command to a politically connected soldier who had formerly been one of Stark‚Äôs lieutenants. This act of disrespect and idiocy infuriated William Stark. He rode to the British line and became a colonel in the king‚Äôs army. This action was very upsetting to his brother, patriot Gen. John Stark. When hearing about his brother leaving the state, John Stark said that leaving was ‚Äúthe best thing he ever did!‚Äù During the war William Stark served in the defense of New York City. The government of New Hampshire confiscated all of his property consisting of thousands of acres of farm and forest land.\\"https://www.derrynews.com/opinion/column-stark-brothers-took-different- paths-in-revolution/article_60d79cb8-f4d8-5f1e-a77a-7d0114163dd8.html Death Stark died from injuries he received in falling from his horse on Long Island, New York during the Battle of Long Island on August 27, 1776. Notes from Debbie Carr record that: \\"According to an \\"Abstract of Graves of Revolutionary Patriots about William Stark\\" he is buried in: Lyme Plain Cemeter in Lyme, Grafton County, New Hampshire 29I\\". However, the Cemetery listing is apparently of his son, William, Jr., b. 1740, d. 5 Oct 1787. m.

He married Mary Stinson on February 22, 1754 and they had seven children: William JR., John, Archibald, Mary, Stephen, Thomas, and James.

History Hartford Seminary's origins date back to 1833 when the Pastoral Union of Connecticut was formed to train Congregational ministers. The next year the Theological Institute of Connecticut was founded at East Windsor Hill, Connecticut. The institution moved to Hartford in 1865 and officially took the name Hartford Theological Seminary in 1885. The Bible Normal College affiliated with the seminary in 1902 and changed its name to Hartford School of Religious Pedagogy. The Kennedy School of Missions became another affiliated activity, originally organized by the Seminary as a separate organization in 1911. In 1913, these three endeavors were combined. In 1961, the entities were legally merged and adopted the new name Hartford Seminary Foundation, which was used until 1981, when the current name came into use. The Hartford Seminary Foundation published the Hartford Quarterly (originally named Bulletin - Hartford Seminary Foundation) from 1960 to 1968. Hartford Seminary began to offer niche concentrations in Christian-Muslim dialogue in 1972, and in 1990 Hartford Seminary officially claimed non- denominational status.Hartford Seminary, Our Story, hartsem.edu, USA, Retrieved December 17, 2017 On Jan. 1, 2018, the Hartford Seminary joined the Boston Theological Institute (BTI), which is the largest theological consortium in the world. Hartford campus When the seminary moved to Hartford in 1865, it was at first located in the area now occupied by buildings of the Wadsworth Atheneum. In the 1910s, it planned a dedicated new campus on Hartford's west side, south of Elizabeth Street. Construction was delayed by World War I, and a handsome campus of Collegiate Gothic Revival buildings was constructed in the 1920s. Surviving elements of this construction phase were used by the seminary until 1981, and currently constitute the campus of the University of Connecticut School of Law. The present main seminary building, designed by architect Richard Meier, was completed in 1981, replacing several buildings demolished from the initial building phase. The seminary also continues to occupy several adjacent buildings that have historically been part of its campus. These, as well as the law school, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, primarily for their architecture. Academics Hartford Seminary Hartford Seminary is centered on two academic centers: the Hartford Institute for Religion Research and the Duncan Black Macdonald Center for the Study of Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations. The seminary offers certificate programs and graduate degrees, including the only accredited Islamic chaplaincy programs. The Muslim World Publication Hartford Seminary has been home to the academic journal The Muslim World since 1938. The journal was founded in 1911.

Although the band became identified with other music groups like UK Decay and Sex Gang Children, the band felt they didn't belong under the Gothic title. The band made three studio albums for four different small labels ‚Äî Fresh Records, Jungle Records, Situation 2, and Clay Records ‚Äî before forming their own label, Tanz, for their final album, Company Of Justice, which they released in 1985. The original line-up of Play Dead consisted of Rob Hickson (vocals), Pete Waddleton (bass guitar), Mark \\"Wiff\\" Smith (drums) and Re-Vox (guitar). In July 1981, Re-Vox was replaced by Steve Green, a very talented guitarist who took the band in a far more successful direction with his unique style of playing. During their active years, Play Dead were well respected among their peers, including the likes of Killing Joke, The Cult and The Sisters Of Mercy in the UK, all of whom had Play Dead as a support band at one time or another. An appearance on Channel 4's flagship music TV show, The Tube in late 1984 also cemented their credibility as a serious band who, despite their own attempts to dis-establish themselves from the Goth genre, were actually true pioneers of the movement with their dark, tribal music and often enigmatic image (photographs of the band members never appeared on any of their vinyl releases). A string of singles were released (many through Stoke-based Clay Records) from late 1983, throughout 1984 and early 1985. Play Dead toured frequently around the UK and Europe and, by 1985, felt they had enough quality material to be able to put out their first ever live album, \\"Into The Fire\\", which was released in May of that year. However, against the backdrop of similar artists such as Spear Of Destiny, The Cult, The Sisters Of Mercy and Fields Of The Nephilim, whose success was evident through having higher profiles in the music press, Play Dead struggled to compete. In 1984, Rob and Pete created the project Mankind's Audio Development (nicknamed M.A.D.). Only one single single was recorded with the two songs \\"Craving\\" and \\"Sunfeast.\\" Waddleton left the group in 1986 and, after a brief period as The Beastmaster Generals, the band dissolved.

The river is the sole drainage outlet of Taal Lake, which empties to Balayan Bay. The river stretches about passing along the towns of Agoncillo, Lemery, San Nicolas and Taal serving as border between the communities. It has a very narrow entrance from Taal Lake. History Before the eruptions of Taal Volcano in the 18th century, Pansipit was a navigable channel connecting Taal Lake to Balayan Bay. Sailing ships and Chinese junks freely entered Taal Lake to visit the town of Taal and other population centers along its shores.Herre, Albert (1927). \\"The Fisheries of Taal Lake and Lake Naujan\\", pp. 288-289. Philippine Journal of Science. The water of the lake was then saline.Blair, Emmma Helen and Robertson, J.A. (1905). \\"The Philippine Islands, 1493-1803: Volume XXIII\\", pg. 209. Arthur H. Clark Company, Cleveland. In 1754, after the culmination of worst eruption of Taal Volcano had subsided, the mouth of the river was found blocked by volcanic material, eventually raising the level of the lake.Maso, Fr. Saderra (1911). The Eruption of Taal Volcano\\", pg. 11. Bureau of Printing, Manila. A narrower Pansipit River eventually formed from the layer of ejecta from the volcano and a new course was created. The present source of the river on the lake is perhaps north of the old entrance with the new channel joining the old channel about down the river valley. The change in the elevation of the lake also prevented sea water from flowing into the lake thus turning it to freshwater, its marine life evolved and adapted to freshwater living. Ecology As the river is the sole drainage outlet, the Pansipit shares many of the unique biota found in the lake. One specific strain, the lake's freshwater population of the jack Caranx ignobilis, is known to conduct its annual migration runs through the river. Commonly known as the \\"giant trevally\\" and locally as maliputo, this population is particularly notable for inhabiting the river's freshwater waters since the species itself is commonly associated with coral reefs. At one time, more than 80 different species of fish were found to inhabit the river's waters, either as a migratory channel or as a permanent residence. This included Taal Lake's now-extinct population of bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas). The map of Taal Lake and Pansipit River with the towns separated by the river. Protection Being the sole outflow of a commercially important lake, the Pansipit has a rich history of management and regulation of its aquatic resources. In 1941 fishing in the river and its surrounding waters was banned with a 5-year closed season by the then Commonwealth of the Philippines. During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II, the exclusive rights to the river for aquaculture purposes were leased to Santiago Banaag. At the time, a maximum of one fish corral was authorized by the contract, and the structure was to cover only up to two-thirds of the width of the river, leaving the remaining third for \\"free navigation and the migration of fishes\\". After the war, the lease was rescinded in 1949 and fishery rights reverted to the towns of Taal and Lemery. Since then, the construction of fish cages has long been a problem for the river's natural ecology. The fish cages, often spanning the width of the entire river, physically block the natural migratory paths of fish species that move between the lake and the sea. The presence of the wooden structures also impede and disrupt the river's natural currents, slowing down the flow of water and creating stagnant spots in the river. By 2002, a high of 623 fish cages were recorded by a census group. Over the years, numerous measures have been attempted to curb the growing number of illegal fish cages in the river. In 1996, fish cages and other aquaculture elements in the river (and the adjoining lake) were ordered removed through an official executive order. Some of the reasons cited referred to pollution of the river caused by effluent waste from the fish pens. The structures were also said to physically impede the progress of native fish migrating up and down the river. Protected area status was granted to the river with the enactment of the National Integrated Protected Areas System (NIPAS) Act in 1996. Another attempt to clear the river was pursued in 2002. A record 623 cages were dismantled during that effort. Less than a decade after, in 2007 cages were found to have been reconstructed in significant amounts throughout the length of the river. This culminated in the latest river-clearing effort in mid-2008 by a special task force appointed for the job. A total of 96 illegal fish cages were removed in June 2008, the number of which had already dropped from the previous year's tally of more than 150 cages. As of July 2008, no fish pens remain within the river's waters.

Album background Shaw had released a couple of singles in the late 1970s on the CBS label, but did not show a serious interest in making additional material until the early 1980s, when new husband Nik Powell (co-founder of the Virgin Group) introduced her to the B.E.F. (British Electric Foundation). Shaw recorded an updated version of the Burt Bacharach/Hal David classic \\"Anyone Who Had a Heart\\" for their Music of Quality and Distinction album, which was subsequently released as a single. Shaw learned that her earlier work had influenced musicians like Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders, and she was invited to join Hynde on stage during one of their concerts to perform one of their songs with them. She and Hynde also sang a duet of Shaw's Top 3 hit from 1964, \\"Girl Don't Come\\". An album was discussed with Virgin Records, who had released the B.E.F.'s album, but Shaw became pregnant with her daughter Amie and delayed the project. In 1983, Shaw wrote and recorded a new original album entitled Choose Life, 1,000 promotional copies of which were released in support of the World Peace Exposition. However demand by fans led to the album being officially released on the Palace label. Around this time, Shaw received a letter signed \\"Two incurable Sandie Shaw fans\\" telling her that \\"The Sandie Shaw legacy is not over yet - there is more to be done.\\" It was in fact from Steven Morrissey and Johnny Marr of The Smiths. They also informed her that they had written a song that they would be delighted if she would record. Though wary at first, Shaw agreed to meet Morrissey and continued to receive letters from him via Geoff Travis of Rough Trade Records (the label to which the band was signed), a personal friend of Powell's. Shaw eventually recorded the song, \\"I Don't Owe You Anything\\" as well as versions of other Smiths songs, including \\"Hand in Glove,\\" which had been their first single. Shaw's version of the song was subsequently released as a single, and reached the Top 30 in the UK Singles Chart. It was accompanied by a performance on Top Of The Pops, which involved Shaw writhing on the floor kicking her feet in the air backed by The Smiths all in bare feet (as a tribute to her quirk of performing barefoot during the 1960s). An album with Rough Trade was discussed, but the project was put on the back burner when Shaw became pregnant. Two years later Shaw was signed to Polydor Records and released two singles with them. She also embarked on her first University tour in over twenty years. Again an album was discussed, but was cancelled due to a change in management and the feeling that the two singles had not done well enough for an album to be made. In the end, Shaw secured a deal with Rough Trade to make the Hello Angel album (the title of which was inspired by a postcard from Morrissey), and it was released in 1988. Personnel Everyone involved with the album was either a personal friend or supporter of Shaw's. She was determined to make it her own personal album, totally unlike the ones she had made two decades previously. Seven of the eleven tracks were co-written by Shaw herself, four of which alongside Chris Andrews, who had written the vast majority of her 1960s hit singles. Morrissey and Stephen Street provided the song \\"Please Help the Cause Against Loneliness\\" which would become the first single to be released from the album. Street was also given production credits for most of the songs. Writing credits were also given to Jim and William Reid of The Jesus and Mary Chain on the song \\"Cool About You.\\" Guitarist Kevin Armstrong was credited on every track with the exception of the now two-year-old \\"Hand in Glove\\" which credited Johnny Marr as guitarist and the rest of The Smiths as musicians. Armstrong also co-wrote two tracks with Shaw and was given production credits on one track. Writer/producer Clive Langer was also given credits on the song \\"Comrade In Arms.\\" Overview The opening track is called \\"Nothing Less Than Brilliant\\" and is written by Shaw and Andrews. Shaw had lost confidence in herself after her initial fame and had spent much of the 1970s poor after her divorce from bankrupt fashion designer Jeff Banks. As mentioned previously, Shaw later came to realise that she had influenced other people, and this song talks about her perception of herself and how she was seen by others in a more positive light. \\"Nothing Less Than Brilliant\\" became the second and final single to be released from the album, and later became the title of a 1994 compilation album. Song number two, the title track, is another Shaw/Andrews track. Andrews had originally written the music for Morrissey to put lyrics to, but Shaw ended up doing them herself instead. \\"Take Him\\", also by Shaw and Andrews, is a tongue-in-cheek rumba/cha-cha-inspired song rumoured to be based on a true incident with Morrissey. \\"A Girl Called Johnny\\" is the first of two cover versions on the album, and was originally recorded by The Waterboys. Mike Scott had originally written the song about American singer Patti Smith. \\"Strange Bedfellows\\", by Shaw and Kevin Armstrong is one of the more eccentric tracks on the album, telling the story of a married couple engaged in some sort of gender-swapping role-play. \\"Please Help the Cause Against Loneliness\\" was written by Morrissey and Stephen Street for Morrissey's first solo album. A demo was recorded though it did not end up on the final product. It was instead given to Shaw who took to the song straight away, and it became the first single to be released from the album. Side two of the album begins with a new mix of Shaw's original Rough Trade hit \\"Hand in Glove\\", which had originally been The Smiths's first single. Stephen Street is credited as remixing the track. \\"Cool About You\\" is a Phil Spector-influenced song written by Jim and Willian Reid of The Jesus and Mary Chain. Several effects used here are reminiscent of the wall of sound, such as plucked strings sounding like raindrops. \\"Flesh and Blood\\" is the other track on which Kevin Armstrong is credited as writing alongside Shaw. \\"Comrade In Arms\\" is possibly the most significant song on the album. Written by Shaw and Clive Langer, it tells of the relationship Shaw had with a close friend who was dying of AIDS. She finished writing the lyrics on the day he died, and it was recorded in the studio in the middle of the night with some friends present. \\"I Will Remain\\" is the final track on the album, and once again Shaw and Andrews are given writing credits.

Biography Quartley was born in Paris and lived there to the age of twelve, when his family moved to Baltimore, Maryland. He studied drawing with his father Frederick William Quartley, who was an English engraver. His father was reputed to have demanded two drawings per week from the young lad. At age 17, Arthur was apprenticed to a sign painter in Baltimore. In 1852 Quartley and his family left Paris for New York City and in 1862, founded a design firm in Baltimore. The firm Emmart & Quartley was regarded as the best decorating company in the city (Dictionary of American Biography); however, young Quartley began painting marine seascapes of Chesapeake Bay, and progressively spent more and more time in that pursuit. He held a successful show of marine paintings at the studio of Norval H. Busey in Baltimore. Scholar Elizabeth Johns remarked that Quartley's work reveals familiarity with the Dutch Masters marine tradition of composition in treatment of light and color. To pursue his painting more seriously, Quartley moved to New York City in 1875. New York at that time had become a premier center for notable painters. From there he painted seascapes of Long Island bays, New York Harbor, the New Hampshire Isle of Shoals, and Naragansett Bay in Rhode Island. The Hudson River School was waning at this point, so that other groups were forming, among them the Tilers, of whom Quartley was a founding member. The Tilers was a group of artists and writers, that included such luminaries as Winslow Homer, William Merritt Chase, and Augustus Saint Gaudens. They met frequently to exchange ideas and decorate ceramic tiles in promotion of their works. They also took excursions for painting, such as the 1878 pilgrimage to Eastern Long Island by Quartley and ten others. On that trip Quartley painted Seascape and also a blue painted tile of an introspective girl at the beach. The journalist and philanthropist John W. McCoy promoted the careers of Quartley and of his friend, the sculptor William H. Rinehart. In the year 1876 Quartley was elected to the National Academy. Quartley's prominence during his lifetime is illustrated by his inclusion as one of 68 painters in the publication American Painters (1880). Some of his noteworthy canvases are: Early Moonlight, Naragansett Bay (1877); Afternoon in August, Coast of Maine (1878); and Low Country on the North Shore of Long Island (1881).

The company's main ports of call were AntwerpHarnack, 1938, page 566 in Belgium, Liverpool and Southampton in the United Kingdom and New York City and Philadelphia in the United States. History The company was founded by Clement Griscom, who led it from its founding until the International Mercantile Marine Co. took it over in 1902. Red Star Line survived IMM's financial crisis in 1915. In the 1930s Red Star Line was part of Arnold Bernstein Line. The company declared bankruptcy in 1934. It operated until 1935 when it ceased trading. Its assets were eventually sold to the Holland America Line. Heritage Red Star Line museum at Antwerp The former warehouses of the Red Star Line in Antwerp were designated as a landmark and reopened as a museum on 28 September 2013 by the City of Antwerp. The main focus of the museum is the travel stories that could be retrieved through relatives of the some two million Red Star Line passengers. In the exhibition the visitor follows the travelers' tracks from the travel agency in Warsaw until their arrival in New York. The museum exhibits works of art depicting the Red Star Line emigrants by the Antwerp artist Eugeen Van Mieghem (1875-1930), together with Red Star Line memorabilia from the collection of Robert Vervoort. About a quarter of the some two million Red Star Line migrants were Jews, largely from Eastern Europe until the exodus driven by the rise of Nazi Germany. Among them were many famous persons, including regular passenger Albert Einstein. On learning of the Nazi confiscation of his possessions, Einstein chose not to return to Germany; his letter resigning from the Prussian Academy of Sciences, written on the line's stationery, is a part of the museum exhibit. Other notable emigrants included the five-year-old Irving Berlin.

Her novels, which have been critical and financial successes, centre on strong female characters and their raunchy exploits. Biography In 1991, she gave up writing her PhD in Art History in order to start writing her first novel, Sally, about a woman embarking on a no-strings erotic affair. Top agent Jonathan Lloyd at Curtis Brown Ltd put the novel into a five-publisher bidding war which resulted in a three-book deal for a six-figure sum. Sally was published in 1996. Chloe followed soon after, and tells of a woman travelling around the four countries of the UK during the four seasons of the year and her various sensual exploits en route. Polly, about a teacher exchange trip between America and England, was published in 1998 and Cat, about a sports journalist covering the Tour de France, in 2000. Further titles were Fen (2001), set in the art world and Pip, about a female clown (2004). Her seventh novel, Love Rules (2005), about whether one listens to one's head or follows one's heart, was published in 2005. Home Truths, which reunites the McCabe characters from earlier novels Cat, Fen and Pip, was published in 2006. In 2008, Freya won the Romantic Novel of the Year Award for her ninth novel, Pillow Talk, which reunites childhood sweethearts Petra and Arlonow a sleepwalker and an insomniac. Pillow Talk was set in the North East of England, specifically in Teesside. Secrets, Freya's tenth novel, also set in the North East, was published in 2009. Because the book's setting was the small Victorian resort of Saltburn by the Sea and featured the famous Transporter Bridge in Middlesbrough, the author was subsequently invited to become an Ambassador for the region.

The organisation is managed by a Council group elected at an Annual General Meeting in November each year, which consists of up to 12 volunteers, who meet in Birmingham every six weeks. There are no specific regional meetings or sub- committees, but each county has a Regional Representative on the Council, a River Users Coordinator to look after the special interests of boat owners on rivers and a Continuous Cruising Representative. Achievements NABO, by promoting the interests of private boaters on Britain's canals, rivers and lakes has achieved the following: *They were successful in taking British Waterways to the Waterway Ombudsman over the lack of consultation concerning boat licence fee increases. By doing so they also brought to British Waterways attention the inadequacies in its Licence and Mooring Permit Conditions. *They have been a leading influence in securing a commitment to minimise the mandatory requirements of the Boat Safety Scheme, and also in securing changes to the appeals procedure. *NABO secured 28 amendments to the British Waterways Act 1995 and concessions on the way it would be applied before it was passed which brought in valuable safeguards for boaters. *They took British Waterways to the Waterways Ombudsman over the BW's Waterways Standards document (standards for depth, facilities, etc. on waterways controlled by British Waterways) because BW had refused to make copies available to the public, and made it available to all boaters at a nominal charge. *NABO continues to promote more dredging, and pressure from NABO and others secured a 50% increase in British Waterways Southern Region dredging budget over a five-year period. *Their campaign for an Independent Waterways Regulator for all waterways, added significantly to British Waterways resolve to restructure their complaints and consultation procedures and produce a statement of intent document titled 'Openness and Accountability'. Membership Members are informed of NABO's current progress and status through the organisations magazine NABO News which is published six/seven times a year, and the 'members pages' on their website.

It was founded in 1922 and in 2004 it became fully integrated with Manulife Financial, with the Maritime Life brand being retired. In 2004 it had 2700 employees. The Maritime Life headquarters was located in Armdale, Nova Scotia (part of Halifax) near the head of the Northwest Arm. After the merger with Manulife Financial, the signage of the building was changed accordingly and the facility became Manulife's central Halifax office. History Maritime Life was co-founded in 1922 by 9 residents of Nova Scotia. At the time of its founding, the company ranked 58th out of 60 insurance companies in Canada. One of the company's founders was The Hon. William Anderson Black, who was later was elected as the member of Parliament for Halifax, from 1923 until his death in 1934. Incidentally, the last president of Maritime Life, prior to the amalgamation with Manulife Financial, was his great-grandson William \\"Bill\\" Black. In his grandfather's tradition, Bill Black ran for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Nova Scotia, but lost to Rodney MacDonald. His election bid for MLA, in the Halifax Citadel riding in 2006, was also unsuccessful. In 1924, Maritime Life wrote its first policies and by 1933 had surpassed $1 million in assets, with that figure doubling two years later. In 1956 the company spread outside of Atlantic Canada, with a branch opening in Kingston, Ontario. Within three years, additional branches were opened in Toronto and Montreal, as well as in the smaller centres of Perth and Windsor in Ontario. By the early 1960s, Maritime Life was one of the fastest growing insurance companies in Canada and it acquired The Royal Guardians insurance company of Montreal in 1961. Total assets for the growing company were $18.8 million. In 1969, the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company of Boston, Massachusetts purchased Maritime Life, making the company its primary Canadian subsidiary. That same year, Maritime Life won a major contract, providing insurance services for personnel of the Canadian Forces. In 1973, the company moved into a distinctive new headquarters in Halifax's Armdale neighbourhood. By the end of the decade, Maritime Life had expanded across Canada, with offices in most major centres. By 1982, the company had approximately $1 billion in assets and in 1986, it ranked 17th out of 150 insurance companies in Canada. By 1993, it had $3.2 billion in assets, with that figure growing to $4.3 billion within two years. In 1995, Maritime Life acquired Confederation Life. In 1997, the company celebrated its 75th anniversary, with $5.5 billion in assets. In 1999, the company doubled in size, with the purchase of Aetna Life Insurance Company. In 2001, Maritime Life purchased Royal & SunAlliance Life Insurance Company, with total assets for the company approaching $13.5 billion and net income exceeding $100 million. In 2003 it acquired the insurance business of Liberty Health and in 2004, for the fifth consecutive year, it was recognized as one of \\"The 50 Best Employers in Canada\\" as ranked by The Globe and Mails Report on Business. On September 29, 2003, Manulife announced its intent to acquire John Hancock Financial, including Maritime Life, for $15 billion.

The park is managed by South African National Parks. The property is included as part of the UNESCO Cape Floral Region World Heritage Site. The park contains two well- known landmarks: Table Mountain, for which the park is named; and the Cape of Good Hope, the most southwestern extremity of Africa.  History  Arguments for a national park on the Cape Peninsula, centred on Table Mountain, began in earnest in the mid-1930s. The Table Mountain Preservation Board was set up in 1952, and in 1957 its recommendation to the National Monuments Board was accepted and Table Mountain was declared a national monument. In the mid 1960s, the Cape Town City Council declared nature reserves on Table Mountain, Lion's Head, Signal Hill, and Silvermine. Following high fire incidence in the 1970s, Douglas Hey was appointed to assess the ecological state of Table Mountain and the southern Peninsula, and he recommended (1978) that all the Peninsula's mountains above 152m should be conserved. This laid the foundations for the Cape Peninsula Protected Natural Environment (CPPNE) area, finally established in 1989. However, environmental management was still bedeviled by the fragmented nature of land ownership on the Peninsula. Following a big fire above the city bowl in 1991, Attorney General Frank Kahn was appointed to reach consensus on a plan for rationalising management of the CPPNE. In 1995, Prof. Brian Huntley recommended that SANParks be appointed to manage the CPPNE, with an agreement signed in April 1998 to transfer around 39,500 acres to SANParks. On 29 May 1998, then-president Nelson Mandela proclaimed the Cape Peninsula National Park. The park was later renamed to the Table Mountain National Park. Geography Cape Town City Bowl, nestled between Table Mountain, Lion's Head, Devil's Peak and Table Bay, the main mountains and peaks that make up the Peninsula, and the Cape of Good Hope in the far south of the Peninsula. Most of the mountainous areas indicated in light and darker brown, as well as the southern end of the Peninsula, south of the 34¬∞ 10'S line of latitude, belong to the Table Mountain National Park. The park runs approximately north-south along the range of mountains that make up the mountainous spine of the Cape Peninsula, from Signal Hill in the north, through Lion's Head, Table Mountain, Constantiaberg, Silvermine, the mountains of the southern Peninsula, terminating at Cape Point. The park is not a single contiguous area; the undeveloped mountainous areas which make up most of the park are separated by developed urban areas on the shallower terrain. Thus the park is divided into three separate sections, as listed below. Table Mountain section This section covers Signal Hill, Lion's Head, Table Mountain proper, including the Back Table (the rear, lower part of the mountain), Devil's Peak, the Twelve Apostles (actually a series of seventeen peaks along the Atlantic seaboard), and Orange Kloof (a specially protected area not open to the public). It borders on central Cape Town in the north, Camps Bay and the Atlantic coast in the west, the Southern Suburbs in the east, and Hout Bay in the south. This section was formed from the Table Mountain National Monument, Cecilia Park, and Newlands Forest. Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden is not officially part of the national park, but its higher reaches are maintained as part of the park. Silvermine-Tokai section This section runs northwest-southeast across the Peninsula from the Atlantic seaboard to the False Bay coast. It covers Constantiaberg, Steenberg Peak and the Kalk Bay mountains. It borders on Hout Bay in the north-west, the suburbs of Constantia and Tokai in the north-east, Kalk Bay in the south-east, and Fish Hoek and Noordhoek in the south-west. This section was formed from the Tokai State Forest and the Silvermine Nature Reserve. Cape Point section Smitswinkel Bay, between Simon's Town and Cape Point. This section covers the most southern area of the Cape Peninsula, stretching from Cape Point and the Cape of Good Hope in the south, as far north as Scarborough on the Atlantic coast and Simon's Town on the False Bay coast. It was formed from the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve. Flora King Protea growing in Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos in Table Mountain National Park Silver trees (Leucadendron argenteum) growing in Peninsula Granite Fynbos in Table Mountain National Park This area forms part of the Cape Floristic Region and as such supports a high diversity of flora, much of which is rare and endemic. Protea, erica, restio and Asteraceae species, as well as geophytes, are all found in abundance. The main indigenous vegetation types are Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos and Cape Granite Fynbos, both of which are endangered and endemic to Cape Town - occurring nowhere else in the world. In addition, some sections of the park are the natural home of deep, indigenous Afro-temperate forests. A well known local tree is the Silver tree (Leucadendron argenteum), a popularly cultivated species which is found in the wild only on the slopes of Lion's Head and a few scattered locations elsewhere on the Cape Peninsula (a notable area is above Kirstenbosch). The Park lies in the heart of the Cape Floral Kingdom, which is a bio-diversity hot spot and seen by botanists as a botanical anomaly. In fact, there are more species of plant in Table Mountain National Park (over two thousand) than exist in the whole of the United Kingdom. Much of the unique flora in the area surrounding the park has been lost to agriculture and urban development. Indigenous plants are being increasingly harvested for traditional medicines, an activity some regard as a form of poaching. Such produce can be found on sale as remedies on the streets of Cape Town's central business district. Indigenous species are also threatened by invasive plants such as Acacia cyclops, three Hakea species, and invasive pines that were planted in commercial timber plantations on the slopes of the mountain also . Today the Table Mountain range has the highest concentration of threatened species of any continental area of equivalent size in the world. afro-montane forest on Table Mountain, with Devil's Peak visible in the distance Commercial plantation of invasive European Pinus pinaster or \\"Cluster Pine\\", on Table Mountain's eastern slopes Removal of non-indigenous forests SANParks have been criticised for their programme of removing invasive non- indigenous trees. These alien forests make up only 2% of the park, but cover areas that were previously incredibly rich in biodiversity. The invasive trees were originally planted as commercial plantations for timber, once most of the indigenous afro-montane forests had been felled. Unfortunately, the fertile lower slopes that were selected for the plantations are also the areas of the park which host the highest proportion of endemic and threatened species. The park's current programme is to allow for the re-growth of the indigenous forests, while slowly removing the plantations of invasive trees. This removal has been controversial however, as some of the pine plantations are recreational areas for people living in the wealthy suburbs adjacent to the park. Fauna Male ostrich at Cape Good Hope Larger predators that historically roamed the area include the Cape lion, leopard (which persisted as late as the 1920s, and tracks are claimed to still be found today), as well as spotted hyena and black-backed jackal. Large herbivores similarly disappeared at the hands of the European settlers, for example elephant, black rhinoceros, kudu, eland, mountain zebra and bontebok, although the last three species were re-introduced to the Cape Point section of the park. Smaller mammals are still found in the park: caracal, rock hyrax and a variety of small antelope species, such as the Cape grysbok and notably the recently re- introduced klipspringer. The population of the alien Himalayan tahr originated from a pair that escaped from the now defunct Zoological Gardens on Groot Schuur Estate below Devil's Peak in 1935. As of 2006, virtually all tahrs have been culled from Table Mountain, thus clearing the way for the re-introduction of the smaller klipspringer, with which the tahr would have competed due to similar niches. However it is still highly likely that a few survived. Chacma baboons inhabit the southern parts of the park. They are highly visible and popular with tourists, but are capable of becoming extremely dangerous when they become accustomed to human beings and start to associate them with free food. Many residents who live in places close to the park, such as Da Gama Park, Tokai and Scarborough, often clash with baboons which have attempted, and succeeded, in raiding their houses for food and many resort to measures such as reinforcing their security by erecting electric fences, and illegal measures like shooting them with pellet guns, running them over, and setting dogs on them. This is ineffective as it can maim the baboons and simply re- inforce their penchant for gaining easy food, as it is easier for baboons to raid a dustbin for scraps rather than forage in the mountains with only one hand.http://www.baboonmatters.org.za/baboons.html Thus it is imperative that visitors to the park are not allowed to feed the baboons at all. A rare endemic species of amphibian is only found on Table Mountain, the Table Mountain ghost frog. The Park lies in the heart of the Cape Floral Kingdom, which is a bio-diversity hot spot and seen by botanists as a botanical anomaly. In fact, there are more species of plant in Table Mountain National Park (over two thousand) than exist in the whole of the United Kingdom.

Education Humphreys graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 1972 with a Bachelor of Business Administration in Finance. Career From 1972 until 1989, Humphreys built a distribution business with his brothers that specialized in the distribution of beauty products and other non-food items to leading retailers across the United States. In 1989 he founded The Humphreys Company, a real estate development and investment firm. Among the company's current projects are Carlton Landing, a 1,800-acre new town development on Lake Eufaula in southeastern Oklahoma, and The Wheeler District, the redevelopment of the 150-acre site of the former Downtown Airpark on the Oklahoma River near downtown Oklahoma City.

From 2008 until 2019, Humphreys was co-host of \\"Flash Point,\\" an award-winning locally-produced Sunday morning political talk show on Oklahoma City NBC affiliate KFOR-TV (channel 4), alongside co-host Mike Turpen and moderator Kevin Ogle. Religious Liberties Controversy On December 10, 2017, in his capacity as a \\"Flash Point\\" cohost, Humphreys made comments about his personal beliefs, the \\"me too\\" movement, homosexuality, and his belief in the existence of universal truth in a culture of moral relativism. His comments prompted calls for his resignation from the University of Oklahoma Board of Regents by the LGBTQ Alumni Society and Freedom Oklahoma. In addition, Paula Lewis, the chair of the Oklahoma City Public Schools board of education, issued a statement calling for Humphreys to resign from the board of John Rex Charter Elementary School, located in downtown Oklahoma City. A few dozen John Rex parents held a protest December 15, 2017, also demanding Humphreys' resignation from the school's board. In January, 2018, more than 2,000 parents of John Rex students and citizens of Oklahoma City signed a letter of support for Humphreys, demanding that he remain in a role of leadership for John Rex and defending his religious liberties http://m.news9.com/story.aspx?story=37220732&catId;=112032 https://humphreysresign.wordpress.com/ On December 21, 2017, at the end of a special meeting of the OU Board of Regents, Humphreys announced he would resign from the board of regents at the beginning of the spring semester in January 2018.

Mayor of Hamilton MacDonald was a colourful figure in office, and endorsed several large development projects for the city. In 1978, he led the city council into accepting a multimillion-dollar plan for an office tower and convention centre in downtown Hamilton.The Globe and Mail, March 23, 1978. The plan, which resulted in the Hamilton Convention Centre and the Ellen Fairclough Building above it, was formally endorsed by the provincial government later in the year.The Globe and Mail, July 21, 1978. He also endorsed a pledge by the federal government to assist in construction of a National Hockey League-sized arena for the city in 1979,The Globe and Mail, February 3, 1979 and argued that Hamilton deserved a team in the next NHL expansion.The Globe and Mail, April 14, 1979. In 1980, the city approved an $80 million plan for a football stadium and arena.The Globe and Mail, October 1, 1980. In 1979, he approved a freeway construction project which eventually became known as the Red Hill Creek Expressway. MacDonald himself owned a house on the Red Hill Valley, where the highway corridor was slated to run. He was quoted as saying, \\"I would prefer it in somebody else's backyard but I've got a greater responsibility than that\\".The Globe and Mail, July 2, 1979. In 1980, he supported plans by the Hamilton Harbour commissioners to build for an industrial area on the city's Beach Strip.The Globe and Mail, November 23, 1979. He also encouraged airport expansion and upgrades to the city's transit system. He was an early supporter of one-tier government for the Hamilton region, and in May 1978 supported a provincial commission report which called for Hamilton to be amalgamated with neighbouring municipalities. This plan was opposed by many in the municipalities, who worried that the city would burden them with financial costs and overwhelm their local identities.The Globe and Mail, May 11, 1978. The provincial government rejected the one-tier recommendation and MacDonald, in protest, insisted that the province pay the full cost of the commission report.The Globe and Mail, June 17, 1978. MacDonald endorsed property tax assessment reform in 1978, noting that the city had lost $1.5 million in appeals the previous year.The Globe and Mail, August 31, 1978. Conservative in matters of perceived government interference, he opposed plans for mandatory smoke detectors in Hamilton apartmentsThe Globe and Mail, October 11, 1979 and was openly contemptuous of the city's anti- smoking by-law.The Globe and Mail, October 2, 1980. With no strong opposition candidates, MacDonald was easily re-elected mayor in November 1978. He was unexpectedly defeated in 1980, losing to a 73-year-old. He was a former Chairman of the regional conservation authority and a former alderman for the City of Hamilton. William Powell who was unknown before the election. The Globe and Mail described the result as a \\"major upset\\". Powell won the election by promising integrity in government and by criticizing MacDonald as arrogant and uncompromising, describing him as \\"a good salesman but a poor manager\\".The Globe and Mail, November 6, 1980. MacDonald launched a strong bid for re-election in 1982, but lost to Bob Morrow.The Globe and Mail, November 9, 1982. It has been reported that MacDonald reached an agreement with Toronto Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard near the end of his mandate, to bring the Colorado Rockies hockey franchise to Hamilton in 1982. His successor is said to have rejected the arrangement, causing the plan to fall through.Toronto Star, April 12, 1990. Federal politics MacDonald was a strong supporter of the Progressive Conservative Party at the federal level. He supported Paul Hellyer's bid for the party leadership in 1976,Hamilton Spectator, May 24, 2000. although he also became an admirer of Joe Clark's abilities during the same campaign. During his tenure as mayor, he once presented Clark with a novelty \\"Trudeau pencil\\", mocking Liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. The pencil had an eraser on both ends, and no point.The Globe and Mail, April 27, 1978. In 1979, he was an honorary pallbearer at the funeral of former prime minister John Diefenbaker.The Globe and Mail, August 18, 1979. He campaigned for the House of Commons of Canada in the 1984 federal election, running for the Progressive Conservative Party in Hamilton East. The PCs did not have a strong support base in this region, and he finished third with 30.5 per cent against Liberal candidate Sheila Copps and New Democrat David Christopherson. This loss effectively ended his career as a politician. The Progressive Conservatives won a majority government under Brian Mulroney, and MacDonald was appointed to the federal parole board.Toronto Star, March 20, 1986. Journalist MacDonald wrote on political matters for the Hamilton Spectator throughout the 1990s, and into the 2000s. He continued to support plans for the Red Hill Creek ExpresswayHamilton Spectator, October 25, 1991 and regional amalgamation,Hamilton Spectator, April 10, 1996. and frequently wrote in support of mayor Bob Morrow and regional chair Terry Cooke. In 2000, he supported Bob Wade over Morrow for mayor.Hamilton Spectator, October 30, 2000. He remained a supporter of the Progressive Conservative Party at the federal level, and wrote pieces supporting party leader Jean Charest while criticizing the rival right-wing Reform Party of Preston Manning. He voted for Joe Clark to return as Progressive Conservative leader in 1999, although he also argued that both Clark and Manning would need to leave the federal scene for a united conservative party to emerge.Hamilton Spectator, March 3, 1999. MacDonald supported the Progressive Conservative government of Mike Harris at the provincial level, although he also wrote a piece strongly critical of the government just prior to the 1999 provincial election. MacDonald argued that Harris \\"betrayed\\" Hamilton-Wentworth by refusing to impose one-tier government, and openly speculated about voting against the Progressive Conservatives for the first time in his life.Hamilton Spectator, June 2, 1999. He was later reconciled with the government, and argued that Harris was the logical choice to lead a united federal conservative party.Hamilton Spectator, August 13, 2002. He retired from the Spectator in late 2002. Since 2002 MacDonald supported Larry Di Ianni's bid to become mayor of Hamilton in 2003,Hamilton Spectator, November 7, 2003 and became involved with the new Conservative Party of Canada in early 2004. There was speculation throughout 2004 that the Red Hill Creek Expressway would be renamed after MacDonald, but this proposal was defeated by council in 2005.Hamilton Spectator, May 4, 2005. He underwent open heart surgery in September 2004.Hamilton Spectator, September 21, 2004. When asked about his legacy after being discharged from hospital, he said, \\"There are very, very few people who are neutral about Jack MacDonald, and I like it that way\\".Hamilton Spectator, October 29, 2004.

It was first circulated in manuscript form and then published on December 3, 1489. It was constantly in print through the middle of the seventeenth century. The first book is about physical health, the second is about prolonging life, and the third (De vita coelit√πs comparanda) is about astral influences. The work focuses not on the soul or body, but on the spiritus, which is described early on:Walker 3 The work focuses on the health and well-being of the scholar. Scholars are described as being naturally prone to extremes of melancholy and thus the ambivalent influence of Saturn, which can be remediated by the influence of the benign planets (the Sun, Jupiter, Venus and Mercury).Walker 5 Ficino considers three types of things beneficial to the spirit: wines and aromatic substances, odours and clean air, and music. Music is described as probably the most important:Walker 5 De vita is an amalgam of philosophy, medicine, magic and astrology. Alongside passages explaining the immortality and divine source and nature of the soul, there are astrological charts and remedies, speeches from various Greek gods arguing with one another, philosophical digressions, medieval prescriptions for various ills, attempts at reconciling the Neoplatonism of Plotinus with Christian scripture, and magical remedies and talismans. Ficino was one of the major philosophical voices of the Italian Renaissance, but he was also a physician, and the son of a physician. De vita is an example of the medical thinking of the early Renaissance, steeped in Galen and Hippocrates and the theory of the four humors and their attendant Aristotelian qualities (e.g., hot, cold, moist, dry), but also beginning to align this viewpoint with the awakening sense of the archetypal significance of the pagan gods, derived from the first exposure in the West for many centuries to the dialogues of Plato and to the Hermetica. (Ficino was the first translator of Plato into Latin.) The result‚Äîparticularly in the third book‚Äîis a work which takes the pagan Classical god-archetypes quite literally, and personifies them with the planets which are named for them. For Ficino, the planets affect the tenor and vigor of the intellectual's mind and the health of his body. But the main thrust of de Vita is the notion that there are remedies and balances that can be undertaken to mitigate their effect‚Äîin fact, to change the temper, even the fate, of a human being. In this regard, Ficino shows his deeply humanist point of view, which sets him apart from earlier writers. The book's thrust depends on the tension Ficino tries to resolve intellectually‚Äîa tension that is typical of the syncretism of much of the early Renaissance‚Äîbetween Classical philosophy and religion and Christian belief. By filtering both through cosmology of Plato, Ficino attempts to reconcile these world-views. An English translation by Charles Boer of the De vita was published in 1982. A critical edition and English translation of the Three Books on Life, with the Latin on one page and the English translation on the facing page, with Introduction and Notes, by Carol V. Kaske and John R. Clark, was re-published in 1998 and again in 2002 by The Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, in conjunction with The Renaissance Society of America.

He was born at Vriesland, Michigan. In 1887 he received an A.B. from Hope College, Holland, Mich., and in 1890, he received an M.A. from New Brunswick Theological Seminary, New Brunswick, N. J.. His other degrees include a D.D. from Hope College in 1904, a L.L.D. from Muskingum College in 1918, and a D.D. from Rutgers College in 1919. After being ordained to the Reformed Church ministry by the Pella, Iowa Classis in 1890, he was a missionary at Busrah, Bahrein, and at other locations in Arabia from 1891 to 1905. He was a member of the Arabian Mission (1890‚Äì1913). He is the founder of American Mission hospital in Bahrain. Zwemer served in Egypt from 1913 to 1929. He also traveled widely in Asia Minor, and he was elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society of London. In 1929 he was appointed professor of missions and professor of the history of religion at the Princeton Theological Seminary, where he taught until 1937. He had married Amy Elizabeth Wilkes on May 18, 1896. He was famously turned down by the American Missionary Society, which resulted in him going overseas alone. He founded and edited the publication The Moslem World for 35 years. He was influential in mobilizing many Christians to go into missionary work in Islamic countries. Zwemer retired from active work on the faculty of Princeton College Seminary at the age of seventy, but continued to write and publish books and articles as well as doing a great deal of public speaking. Zwemer died in New York City at the age of eighty-four. According to Ruth A. Tucker, Ph.D., Samuel Zwemer's converts were \\"probably less than a dozen during his nearly forty years of service\\" and his \\"greatest contribution to missions was that of stirring Christians to the need for evangelism among Muslims\\".Ruth A. Tucker. From Jerusalem to Irian Jaya: A Biographical History of Christian Missions. p. 241.  Career  In his biography of Raymond Lull, Zwemer divided Lull‚Äôs ministry threefold‚ÄòLull‚Äôs lifework was three-fold: he devised a philosophical or educational system for persuading non-Christians of the truth of Christianity; he established missionary colleges; and he himself went and preached to the Moslems...‚Äô Zwemer, Raymond Lull: First Missionary to the Moslems (New York: Funk & Wagnalls, 1902), 63-64. and we may use the same broad categories to examine Zwemer‚Äôs own ministry: Evangelism, Writing and Recruitment.  Evangelism  James Cantine, J.G. Lansing, and Samuel M. Zwemer, Founding Fathers of Arabian Mission for the Reformed Church of America In 1889, Zwemer co-founded with James Cantine at the Seminary, the American Arabian Mission. Zwemer saw his first milestone in his ministry as leaving for Arabia in 1890 to work directly with the Muslim community.He settled at first in Basrah and then he moved with his wife Amy to Bahrain, where they stayed until 1905. Ruth Tucker, From Jerusalem to Irian Jaya, 240. At this time, his main mode of evangelism was distribution of literature‚ÄòThe distribution of the Word of God always holds the first place. It has always proved its power.‚Äô Zwemer, ‚ÄòA Call to Prayer‚Äô, 152. and personal conversation.Ruth Tucker, From Jerusalem to Irian Jaya, 239. He thought personal interaction was always the most effective mode: Samuel Zwemer, ‚ÄòBroadcasting our message‚Äô, The Moslem World 29/3 (1939): 217. He combined models of confrontational and a more irenic approach of presenting the love of Christ, ‚Äòcharacteristic of the student volunteers‚Äô.Ruth Tucker, From Jerusalem to Irian Jaya, 241. cf. Zwemer, ‚ÄòA Call to Prayer‚Äô in Islam and the Cross. Edited by Roger S. Greenway. Original year 1923. Phillipsburg: P&R;, 2002. 147. Two methods stand out in clear contrast: the polemic and the irenic; the method of argument, debate, contrast, and comparison on the one hand, and on the other had the method of loving approach along lines of least resistance.‚Äô Stories of his spontaneous interaction with people suggest that he was a capable and creative personal evangelist.e.g. The story of the Cretan Tavern keeper and asking the fruit vendor for ‚Äòfruit of the Spirit‚Äô. Jesse R. Wilson, ‚ÄòOne of a kind‚Äô, Christian Century 84/21 (1967): 687-688.  Writing  In the tradition of Lull,‚ÄòIt was said that of Raymond Lull that he wrote an unbelievable number of books - hundreds of manuscripts of his works may be found in European libraries to this day.

Recruitment  Zwemer‚Äôs third milestone was accepting a professorship at Princeton in 1929 and marked an era of equipping and recruiting for the missionary movement, though this had been a significant aspect of his career from the beginning.

First foundation Engraving in \\"Topographia Germaniae des Matthaeus Merian\\" of about 1644 The monastery at Scheyern was established in 1119 as the final site of the community founded in around 1077 at Bayrischzell by Countess Haziga of Aragon, wife of Otto II, Count of Scheyern, the ancestors of the Wittelsbachs. The first monks were from Hirsau Abbey, of which the new monastery was a priory, founded as it was against the background of the Investiture Controversy and the Hirsau Reforms. The original site proved unsuitable for a number of reasons, including difficulties with water supply, and the monastery moved in 1087 to Fischbachau. When that site too proved unsuitable, they moved to Petersberg, in 1104. When Haziga, the widowed Countess of Scheyern, left Burg Scheyern in 1119 for Burg Wittelsbach, the castle from which the family subsequently took their name, the old castle, constructed in about 940, was given to the monks at Petersberg and became Scheyern Abbey, independent of Hirsau. Scheyern was considered a Wittelsbach family monastery, which they used as a place of burial until 1253. The Wittelsbachs also retained the office of Vogt. The dedication is to the Holy Cross and the Assumption of the Virgin Mary: the abbey has had in its possession since 1180 a relic of the True Cross from Jerusalem, and is still today a place of pilgrimage for this reason. By the 13th century the abbey had already gained a reputation for its school of illumination and its scriptorium. It suffered particularly severely in the Thirty Years' War and did not participate afterwards in the Baroque revival to the same extent as other monasteries in Bavaria. In the 18th century however it was refurbished in the style of the Rococo. On 15 November 1802 the monastery came under the governance of the territorial rulers, and on 21 March 1803 was dissolved as part of the secularisation of Bavaria. The buildings were sold, and changed hands several times in a short period. Second foundation Recent photograph (2011) In 1838 however under Ludwig I of Bavaria the monastery was re-established, and re-settled by monks from Metten Abbey; in 1843 it regained the status of an abbey. Between 1876 and 1878 the church, now serving both the community and the parish, was restored to the Romanesque style. Scheyern now also possesses a Byzantine Institute, specialising in the works of Saint John of Damascus. It also enjoys historical links with Hungary. Scheyern Abbey is a member of the Bavarian Congregation of the Benedictine Confederation. Schools Shortly after the re-establishment in 1838, a grammar school was opened. In 1939 all schools run by religious orders were closed, including Scheyern Abbey's. After World War II a humanistic Gymnasium was opened here. It was replaced however in 1970 by the Schyrengymnasium in Pfaffenhofen. Once the transfer to the new school was complete, the monastery set up a residential high school for vocational training, the Staatliche Berufsoberschule, a type of school which was considered very experimental at the time. It opened in 1976 and is still in operation.

The summit of Pores Knob is only 2,680 feet (817 meters) above sea level, yet the mountain stands prominently above the surrounding countryside, rising close to 1,500 feet above its base.Hugh Talmage Lefler & Albert Ray Newsome, North Carolina: The History of a Southern State, University of North Carolina Press. Geographical location The mountain itself is nearly unconnected to any other peak in the Brushy Mountains, and could thus be considered a monadnock, or isolated mountain peak. A rough gravel road leads to the mountain's summit, which is devoid of trees but does contain several radio towers. From the summit a person can see up to 75 miles on a clear day, and can view a large portion of the Appalachian Mountain range in North Carolina, several of the highest mountains in the state of Virginia, and the skyline of Charlotte, North Carolina, approximately 70 miles to the south.

It is situated near the hamlet of Todpool, between the villages of Twelveheads and St Day, three miles (5 km) east of Redruth. History A legal document of 1512 about a theft of tin \\"near Poldyth in Wennap\\" indicates that mining was probably taking place around Poldice at that time, but this mine is certainly known to have been in operation by the 17th century. In 1748, Poldice's chief adventurer William Lemon and manager John Williams started the Great County Adit in the Carnon Valley. It formed a cheap and effective method of draining many of the mines in the locality and also provided a means of locating new lodes of ore. When the adit reached Poldice in the late 1760s, the mine was using two Newcomen steam engines, with cylinders of diameter 66 inches and 60 inches to drain the mine into the adit. As the mine was some distance from the sea, transport to market was a problem for the mining operation. A pioneering railway, the Portreath Tramroad was opened in 1812 giving access to Portreath harbour. In November 1821 a 90-inch Woolf single-cylinder pumping engine was installed at the mine, the third one of this size in the county, after two had been installed at Consolidated Mines in February of the same year. These were by far the largest steam engines in Cornwall at the time.Barton 1966, p. 41 In 1842 this engine was raising an average of 887 gallons per minute and it was one of the most heavily worked engines in the county.Barton 1966, p. 102 It was re-cylindered as an 85 inch in 1845 and was still working well when it was sold for ¬£700 in August 1867 to Great Western Deep Coal Co. in the Forest of Dean. By the 1860s the copper industry was in decline, and some time between 1869 and 1872 the mine sold ¬£12,000 worth of redundant equipment to J. C. Lanyon & Son of Redruth, a major dealer and exporter of mine equipment.Barton 1966, pp. 65‚Äì66 Despite these sales, the mine purchased from Perran Foundry a new 85-inch pumping engine that cost ¬£2,250 and which was in operation by early 1873. At the time it was needed to deal with the water flooding into the mine as a result of a very wet winter, but in July 1873 after working for just 6 months, the engine was up for sale and the mine had closed because it was unable to cope with the cost of pumping water out of the workings. The engine was sold to a company in Scotland.Barton 1966, p. 71 Minerals The mine was extracting tin ore in 1748, but by 1788 the output of copper ore exceeded that of tin, and by the 1790s it was making a good profit. In the early 19th century the mine merged with neighbour Wheal Unity. The mine switched to arsenic extraction, although metals were still being mined in decreasing quantities, but by the 1910s most of the activity was over and although small- scale mining continued into the 1920s, it closed in 1930. Apart from the enormous quantities of the common ores mined at Poldice, the area was also known for rarer and more valuable minerals including chalcophyllite, olivenite, mimetite and liroconite. The site today Today, the ruins of many mine buildings and mineshafts are visible in the Poldice Valley, which has not seen any further development since the end of mining. The valley is now a nature reserve. References * Poldice Valley, Bob Acton, Landfall Publications, 1990.

It is considered to be pseudoscientific and is different from the meaning of \\"engram\\" in cognitive psychology. According to Dianetics and Scientology, from conception onwards, whenever something painful happens while the \\"analytic mind\\" is unconscious, engrams are supposedly being recorded and stored in an area of the mind Scientology calls the \\"reactive mind\\". The term engram was coined in 1904 by the German scholar Richard Semon, who defined it as a \\"stimulus impression\\" which could be reactivated by the recurrence of \\"the energetic conditions which ruled at the generation of the engram.\\" Convenience link at http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/mom/Messiah_or_Madman.txt . L. Ron Hubbard re-used Semon's concept when he published Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health in 1950. He conceived of the engram as a form of \\"memory trace\\", an idea which had long existed in medicine. According to physician Joseph Winter, who collaborated in the development of the Dianetics philosophy, Hubbard had taken the term \\"engram\\" from a 1936 edition of Dorland's Medical Dictionary, where it was defined as \\"a lasting mark or trace...In psychology it is the lasting trace left in the psyche by anything that has been experienced psychically; a latent memory picture.\\" Hubbard had originally used the terms \\"Norn\\", \\"comanome\\" and \\"impediment\\" before alighting on \\"engram\\" following a suggestion from Winter. Hubbard equates the reactive mind to the engram or reactive memory bank. An engram is described as a \\"cellular level recording\\" that includes both physical and emotional pain. Engrams are stored in chains or series of incidents that are similar. Hubbard describes the engram as \\"a definite and permanent trace left by a stimulus on the protoplasm of a tissue. It is considered a unit group of stimuli impinged solely on the cellular being.\\" In Dianetics and Scientology doctrine, engrams are believed to originate from painful incidents, which close down the \\"analytic function\\", leaving a person to operate only on the \\"reactive\\" level, where everything, including pain, position and location are experienced as \\"aspects of the unpleasant whole.\\" This engram is restimulated if the person is reminded of the painful experience days later, causing feelings of guilt or embarrassment ‚Äì another engram. This cycle is called a \\"lock\\" in Scientology terminology. Hubbard's concept of the engram evolved over time. In Dianetics, he wrote that \\"The word engram, in Dianetics is used in its severely accurate sense as a 'definite and permanent trace left by a stimulus on the protoplasm of a tissue'\\", which followed fairly closely the original definition in Dorland's. He later repudiated the idea that an engram was a physical cellular trace, redefining his concept as being \\"a mental image picture of a moment of pain and unconsciousness\\".L. Ron Hubbard Ability: the Magazine of Dianetics and Scientology, Issue 36, Washington D. C., mid-October 1956 According to Hubbard whenever an engram is stimulated it increases in power. Jeff Jacobsen compared auditing for engrams in Scientology to the Freudian psychoanalytic concept of abreaction, equating engrams to the painful subconscious memories that abreaction therapy brings up to the conscious mind. He quoted Nathaniel Thornton, who compared abreaction to confession.Jeff Jacobsen. \\"Dianetics: From Out of the Blue?\\" Reprinted from The Arizona Skeptic, vol. 5, no. 2, September/October 1991, pp. 1-5. Accessed on 2010-06-15. Dorthe Refslund Christensen describes engrams in layman's terms as trauma, a means to explain the long and short term effects of painful experiences. According to Christensen, Hubbard wrote about the dramatization of an engram, where the one who suffered and recorded the pain as an engram relates all sensory perceptions during the time of the painful incident to the incident. These sensory perceptions become \\"restimulators\\" that remind the individual of the pain and triggers him or her to re-experience it. Scholar Richard Holloway writes that according to Scientology, engrams are \\"damaging experiences that happen by accident,\\" bruises through time implanted on thetans through the course of millions of lives. Sometimes the damage is intentionally inflicted by thetans who desired power over other thetans. Deliberate injuries are called implants in Scientology. Hubbard wrote, \\"Implants result in all varieties of illness, apathy, degradiation, neurosis and insanity and are the principle causes of these in man.\\" The Christian idea of heaven is a deceptive implant, Hubbard taught, for there is an infinite series of lives after the first, contrary to the Christian notion of the afterlife. Dianetics became Scientology in 1952 and the concept of clearing engrams remains a central part of the practices of the Church of Scientology.Christian D. Von Dehsen-Scott L.

They emerged during a time when society, the arts, and people were changing quickly. The inner circle of this new visual art movement consisted of Kenneth Noland, Morris Louis, Gene Davis, Howard Mehring, Tom Downing, and Paul Reed. The Washington Color School, a visual art movement, describes a form of image making concerned primarily with color field painting, a form of non-objective or non-representational art that explored ways to use large solid areas of paint. The Washington Color School originally consisted of a group of painters who showed works in an exhibit called the \\"Washington Color Painters\\" at the now-defunct Washington Gallery of Modern Art in Washington from June 25 to September 5, 1965. The exhibition's organizer was Gerald \\"Gerry\\" Nordland and the painters who exhibited were Sam Francis, Gene Davis, Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland, Howard Mehring, Thomas \\"Tom\\" Downing, and Paul Reed. This exhibition, which subsequently traveled to several other venues in the United States, including the Walker Art Center, solidified Washington's place in the national movement and defined what is considered the city's signature art movement, according to art historians and journalists alike. The Washington Color School artists painted largely non-representational works, and were central to the larger color field movement. Though not generally considered abstract expressionists due to the orderliness of their works and differing motivating philosophies, many parallels can be drawn between the Washington Color School and the abstract expressionists. Minimally, the use of stripes, washes, and fields of single colors of paint on canvas were common to most artists in both groups. A common technique used in the Washington Color School was \\"soak staining\\" or just \\"staining\\", in which the artist would pour a thinned painting medium onto canvas and let it sit over time. The result would be a stain in the canvas with no visible traces of conventional application, such as brush strokes. After their initial benchmark exhibition, Davis, Mehring, and Reed were joined by Timothy Corkery, Willem de Looper, and Jacob Kainen at The Seventeenth Area Exhibition of Artists of Washington and the Adjacent Area at The Corcoran Gallery of Art from November 12 to December 19, 1965. The Eighteenth Area Exhibition at The Corcoran from November 18 to December 31, 1967 again featured artists including de Looper, Corkery, Downing, Gilliam and Kainen. Many of these artists exhibited at the Jefferson Place Gallery, originally directed by Alice Denney and later owned and directed by Nesta Dorrance/Sept 21,1969 Washington Post Dorrance/) Other artists associated with the group include: Anne Truitt, Mary Pinchot Meyer, Leon Berkowitz, Jacob Kainen, Alma Thomas, James Hilleary, and others. The group is sometimes thought to have expanded as it achieved a dominant presence in the Washington, D.C. visual art community through the 1960s into the 1970s. Along with the original Washington Color School painters, a second generation also exhibited at Jefferson Place Gallery.(6/69 ‚ÄúFour Minds With It‚Äù Wash Star; Benjamin) those artists remained influential even as some of its members dispersed elsewhere. Other works that reflect the Washington Color School include Sam Gilliam's suspended paintings (whose style can be described by some as Baroque), Timothy Corkery's sharp Arrows and contrasting diffuse architectural doorways. Rockne Krebs' transparent sculptures, light and laser works, Ed McGowin's vacuum-formed pieces which he was ending and moving towards a more personal art (tableau), Bill Christenberry's neon works, which led him to deal more directly with his roots, and the work of Bob Stackhouse and Tom Green. Though the six artists who exhibited in the seminal Washington Color School show were all men, women have had an equal presence in the movement. Hilda Thorpe (Hilda Shapiro Thorpe), for example, a color field painter who made oversized paintings and paper sculptures, taught a generation of artists in the Washington, D.C. area. Other Washington Color School female artists include Anne Truitt (whose work relates to the 'minimalist-purity' side of three-dimensional painterly objects and painters), Mary Pinchot Meyer, and Alma Thomas. During spring and summer 2007, arts institutions in Washington, D.C. staged a citywide celebration of color field painting, including exhibitions at galleries and museums of works by members of the Washington Color School. In 2011, a group of Washington art collectors began the Washington Color School Project, to gather and publish information about the history of the color painters and abstract art in Washington. Though some of them were not born in Washington, they exhibited together representing Washington as a new hub for the visual arts.

It was founded in April 1909 and its publisher (from 1912 on) was Eugen Diederichs from Jena. From 1939 until 1944 Die Tat was continued as Das XX. Jahrhundert. 1909‚Äì1912 The magazine was founded by the freemason Ernst Horneffer. It had the subtitle Wege zu freiem Menschentum, which in this case would be that of a Nietzsche-man. 1912‚Äì1928 In October 1912 Eugen Diederichs took control of the magazine, which at that point had only a distribution of about 1,000. The content would change, and from now on it would sport the subtitle Eine sozial-religi√∂se Monatsschrift, later changed to Sozial-religi√∂se Monatsschrift f√ºr deutsche Kultur. It would not be published during the First World War. Again, in 1921 Diederichs would change the title of Die Tat, implying another change of viewership and ideology: Die Tat. Monatsschrift f√ºr die Zukunft deutscher Kultur. 1928‚Äì1929 In 1928 Diederichs transferred editorial control of Die Tat to the writer Adam Kuckhoff (who later gets to be executed by the Nazis). This would only last shortly. The magazine would be restyled however, getting the subtitle Monatsschrift zur Gestaltung neuer Wirklichkeit. 1929‚Äì1933 Tat Schriften (1931) Hans Zehrer would become (unofficial) chief editor of Die Tate in September 1929 (now subtitled as Unabh√§ngig Monatsschrift zur Gestaltung neuer Wirklichkeit), and would together with Ernst Wilhelm Eschmann, Ferdinand Fried and Giselher Wirsing make Die Tate into an influential promoter of the Tatkreis and the Conservative Revolutionary movement. In a short time the circulation of the magazine would rise to 30,000, attracting mostly a middle- class populace, and becoming a front-runner of the Nazi propaganda machine with the magazine's stress on autarky, nationalism, and anti-capitalistic tendencies. It also provided a front for Kurt von Schleicher, when Die Tate took control of the Berlin paper T√§gliche Rundschau in 1932. 1933‚Äì1939 In 1933 the Nazis took control of the publication and Giselher Wirsing would become its main editor, changing the subtitle of the magazine to Unabh√§ngige Monatsschrift in 1934. The last subtitle change of the magazine occurred in 1936, fittingly it was now to be named the Deutsche Monatsschrift.

In addition the school serves students from all across the county that are selected to enroll in its prestigious Biomedical Program. History In 1950 a permanent building was constructed, in phases. Beginning in the 1980s the district made plans to renovate or replace the building, but delays occurred as PGCPS resources were devoted to schools that needed to be built or ones that had more serious problems in their facilities. In 1999 PGCPS decided that Bladensburg High would get a new building instead of a renovation. Prior to 2001 the school building became infested with insects and rats, prompting PGCPS officials to make its replacement a priority. \\\\- Also under the title \\"Residents upset Bladensburg High still in Bowie .\\" The $45 million project was scheduled to begin in January 2001 and was originally to last until circa 2003. In 2000 officials were looking for a campus to temporarily house the students. The first plan was to send the students to the former Northwestern High School building, but the Hyattsville city council disapproved of this as it felt the Bladensburg students would be too close to the Northwestern students, already occupying the current school building. The second choice was a building in Bowie, but around 100 Bowie residents protested against this plan in a city hall meeting; Several Bowie city council members stated that the controversy gave Bowie a negative image. Bladensburg High was temporarily relocated to the Belair Annex in Bowie, a former school building that was used by PGCPS to house excess students from other schools; \\\\- Also published July 25 as \\"Bladensburg High to push confines of Belair Annex even further \\" Bowie residents hoped to use the annex to relieve area schools that had excess students. By 2002 the district planned to install 18 trailers at Belair to house additional students. The trailers were later 22, then 38. The opening of the new Bladensburg High was pushed back from 2004 to 2005, and the swelling student population that was far larger than the capacity of the original school necessitated additional construction, eroding the patience of the residents of surrounding Bowie neighborhoods who felt impacted by the additional buildings and traffic. In addition Bladensburg students wished for the new campus to be complete as they perceived the temporary facilities to be inadequate. The new Bladensburg High opened in August 2005. In April 2011, Bladensburg High School won three first-place awards, placing the schools in Bladensburg as the number-one contender in Communication, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math. In 2011, Bladensburg High School appeared in several media showcases for its work with the DREAM Act; Communication, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math awards; Secondary School Reform courses; Nobel Laureate William Daniel Phillips' physics presentation at the school; and winning the Grammy Foundation Award for Excellence in Music. Bladensburg High School graduated a Gates Millennium Scholar in 2009 and its first Posse Foundation scholar in 2011. Demographics Bladensburg has had significant historical changes in the demographics of its students. When Bladensburg High School opened in the mid-1930s, all students were white. Due to the desegregation of public schools nationwide in 1954 and, later, the changing population of Prince George's County overall, student enrollment is now 49% African-American and 49% Hispanic/Latino. Programs In 2011 the school was one of two in the county with an on-site daycare; it also had classes for new parents. Curriculum Bladensburg High School offers programs of study in biomedicine, culinary arts, cosmetology, agriculture, and nursing. Over the last two years, the school, along with its feeder middle school and elementary school, participated in the national Communication, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math competition in Houston.

Hoogerbrugge was born in Rotterdam, where he is still based, and started out as a painter and cartoonist until he found the internet in 1996. He is the creator of the extremely popular Modern Living Neurotica series as well as his current interactive series Hotel, created for the online SubmarineChannel. Han has also created prints and drawings that have appeared in galleries such as the Centraal Museum Utrecht in the Netherlands as part of their collection as well as Museo Tamayo in Mexico City and in the Design Museum in London. A book of his work was published in September 2008. Notable works=Neurotica 1998‚Äì2001 Originally Han's Modern Living / Neurotica series was a comic strip which he described as a \\"ongoing self-portrait\\" that chronicled his life as an artist during the mid-1990s. It was during this time that he decided to adapt his Neurotica idea for the internet and began publishing Modern Living Neurotica on his own website first as Animated Gif's and later using Macromedia's Flash which introduced his first attempt at creating interactive art media. The series later concluded in 2001 when the 100th episode was published. Online flash animations Hoogerbrugge also created a short interactive animation titled \\"Flow\\" on albinoblacksheep.com.

The final episode of the series was released in May 2006. There is also a fake website here which is supposed to be Dr. Doglin's own website which has an ad for volunteers. NAILS 2002‚Äì07 Nails was begun in 2002 and ended in 2007. It consisted of a series of interactive flash shorts, that are reminiscent of the original Neurotica series, with him featuring prominently as the main character. 27 of these interactive shorts were made. Pro Stress Han's latest series is a collaboration with writer Paul A. Hall called Pro Stress. The series began on August 28, 2006 and ended October 13, 2006 after seven 'episodes'. A Pro Stress pill box was also released in a limited edition of 8 and is available from Han's website. He has recently begun work on Pro Stress 2.0, which has adopted more of a traditional comic style. It is renewed daily, as a comic- esque strip is added, one per day. Occasionally paintings, quotes and portraits are included in amongst these, more often than not on the weekends. This project is noticeably more focused towards Han's dry, surrealist humour than his previous work. Prostress 2.0 began in the 38th week of 2008 and is still being updated.

Awards given for this profession in the entertainment industry include the Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and entertainment industry awards such as the Emmy Awards, and the Golden Globes. In some countries professional licenses are required by agencies in order for them to hire the MUA. Bigger production companies have in-house makeup artists on their payroll although most MUA's generally are freelance and their times remain flexible depending on the projects. right Makeup techniques ; Fashion Fashion makeup is used in magazine photography as well as on the fashion runway. Avant-garde makeup is also an applicable technique used for projects that require experimental themes. Fashion makeup is also commonly used in television and film ranging for the natural prime look to more sophisticated applications such as color balance. ; Theatrical makeup Stage makeup is used as a method in conjunction with stage lighting to highlight the actors' faces in order to make expressions visible to the audience from moderate distances. This often includes defining the eyes and lips as well as the highlights and lowlights of the facial bones. ; Special make-up effects (FX makeup) The use of special effects techniques enhancing physical features to exhibit as well as fantasy makeup. The use of prosthetics and plaster casting are also required for projects that entails non-human appearances. Accents such as theatrical blood and ooze are also techniques applicable to this type of makeup. ; Airbrushing The use of an airbrush which is a small air-operated device that sprays various media some products and water-based makeup by a process of nebulization. The earliest record of this type of cosmetic application dates back to the 1925 film version of Ben-Hur, it has recently been re-popularized by the advent of HDTV and digital photography, where the camera focuses on higher depths of detail. Liquid foundations that are high in coverage but thin in consistency are applied with the airbrush for full coverage without a heavy build-up of product. ; Bridal makeup Bridal makeup is a new segment in a makeup artist's repertoire. From ethnic, to glamorous, to contemporary, makeup artists are now an important part of wedding planning in Asia, Europe, Africa and North America. ; High definition This is an art which involves the use of light reflectors and ingredients such as minerals to give the skin a flawless finish. This was developed due to the further development of high definition mediums and the cost implications of airbrush makeup. Makeup artists in Bollywood In 1955 the Bollywood group Cine Costume Make- Up Artist & Hair Dressers' Association (CCMAA) created a rule that did not allow women to obtain memberships as makeup artists. However, in 2014 the Supreme Court of India ruled that this rule was in violation of the Indian constitutional guarantees granted under Article 14 (right to equality), 19(1)(g) (freedom to carry out any profession) and Article 21 (right to liberty). The judges of the Supreme Court of India stated that the ban on women makeup artist members had no \\"rationale nexus\\" to the cause sought to be achieved and was \\"unacceptable, impermissible and inconsistent\\" with the constitutional rights guaranteed to the citizens. The Court also found illegal the rule which mandated that for any artist, female or male, to work in the industry, they must have domicile status of five years in the state where they intend to work. In 2015 it was announced that Charu Khurana had become the first woman to be registered by the Cine Costume Make-Up Artist & Hair Dressers' Association. In June 2014, the Cine Costume Make-Up Artist & Hair Dressers' Association (CCMAA) authorised an official protest on the movie set of Bang Bang! in protest of a foreign makeup artist, Daniel Bauer working on the movie for its lead actress, Katrina Kaif. The CCMAA and 15 of its members protested on the movie set as Daniel Bauer was not registered with the Union, despite the Union banning foreign artists working in Bollywood.

The process employs the use of a cryptographic hash to validate authenticity and integrity. Code signing can provide several valuable features. The most common use of code signing is to provide security when deploying; in some programming languages, it can also be used to help prevent namespace conflicts. Almost every code signing implementation will provide some sort of digital signature mechanism to verify the identity of the author or build system, and a checksum to verify that the object has not been modified. It can also be used to provide versioning information about an object or to store other meta data about an object. The efficacy of code signing as an authentication mechanism for software depends on the security of underpinning signing keys. As with other public key infrastructure (PKI) technologies, the integrity of the system relies on publishers securing their private keys against unauthorized access. Keys stored in software on general-purpose computers are susceptible to compromise. Therefore, it is more secure, and best practice, to store keys in secure, tamper-proof, cryptographic hardware devices known as hardware security modules or HSMs. Providing security Many code signing implementations will provide a way to sign the code using a system involving a pair of keys, one public and one private, similar to the process employed by TLS or SSH. For example, in the case of .NET, the developer uses a private key to sign their libraries or executables each time they build. This key will be unique to a developer or group or sometimes per application or object. The developer can either generate this key on their own or obtain one from a trusted certificate authority (CA). Code signing is particularly valuable in distributed environments, where the source of a given piece of code may not be immediately evident - for example Java applets, ActiveX controls and other active web and browser scripting code. Another important usage is to safely provide updates and patches to existing software. Windows, , and most Linux distributions provide updates using code signing to ensure that it is not possible for others to maliciously distribute code via the patch system. It allows the receiving operating system to verify that the update is legitimate, even if the update was delivered by third parties or physical media (disks). Code signing is used on Windows and Mac OS X to authenticate software on first run, ensuring that the software has not been maliciously tampered with by a third- party distributor or download site. This form of code signing is not used on Linux because of that platform's decentralized nature, the package manager being the predominant mode of distribution for all forms of software (not just updates and patches), as well as the open-source model allowing direct inspection of the source code if desired. Debian-based Linux distributions (among others) validate downloaded packages using public key cryptography.https://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt Trusted identification using a certificate authority (CA) The public key used to authenticate the code signature should be traceable back to a trusted root authority CA, preferably using a secure public key infrastructure (PKI). This does not ensure that the code itself can be trusted, only that it comes from the stated source (or more explicitly, from a particular private key).https://casecurity.org/wp- content/uploads/2013/10/CASC-Code-Signing.pdf A CA provides a root trust level and is able to assign trust to others by proxy. If a user trusts a CA, then the user can presumably trust the legitimacy of code that is signed with a key generated by that CA or one of its proxies. Many operating systems and frameworks contain built-in trust for one or more certification authorities. It is also commonplace for large organizations to implement a private CA, internal to the organization, which provides the same features as public CAs, but it is only trusted within the organization. Extended validation (EV) code signing Extended validation (EV) code signing certificates are subject to additional validation and technical requirements, . These guidelines are based on the CA/B Forum's Baseline Requirements and Extended Validation Guidelines. In addition to validation requirements specific to EV, the EV code signing guidelines stipulate that \\"the Subscriber‚Äôs private key is generated, stored and used in a crypto module that meets or exceeds the requirements of FIPS 140-2 level 2.\\" Certain applications, such as signing Windows 10 kernel- mode drivers, require an EV code signing certificate. Additionally, Microsoft's IEBlog states that Windows programs \\"signed by an EV code signing certificate can immediately establish reputation with SmartScreen reputation services even if no prior reputation exists for that file or publisher.\\" =Sample EV code signing certificate= This is an example of a decoded EV code signing certificate used by SSL.com to sign software. \`SSL.com EV Code Signing Intermediate CA RSA R3\` is shown as the Issuer's commonName, identifying this as an EV code signing certificate.

Alternative to CAs The other model is where developers can choose to provide their own self-generated key. In this scenario, the user would normally have to obtain the public key in some fashion directly from the developer to verify the object is from them for the first time. Many code signing systems will store the public key inside the signature. Some software frameworks and OSs that check the code's signature before executing will allow you to choose to trust that developer from that point on after the first run. An application developer can provide a similar system by including the public keys with the installer. The key can then be used to ensure that any subsequent objects that need to run, such as upgrades, plugins, or another application, are all verified as coming from that same developer. Time- stamping Time-stamping was designed to circumvent the trust warning that will appear in the case of an expired certificate. In effect, time-stamping extends the code trust beyond the validity period of a certificate. In the event that a certificate has to be revoked due to a compromise, a specific date and time of the compromising event will become part of the revocation record. In this case, time-stamping helps establish whether the code was signed before or after the certificate was compromised.  Code signing in Xcode  Developers need to sign their iOS and tvOS apps before running them on any real device and before uploading them to the App Store. This is needed to prove that the developer owns a valid Apple Developer ID. An application needs a valid profile or certificate so that it can run on the devices. Problems Like any security measure, code signing can be defeated. Users can be tricked into running unsigned code, or even into running code that refuses to validate, and the system only remains secure as long as the private key remains private.http://blog.trendmicro.com/fake-antivirus-solutions- increasingly-stolen-code-signing- certificates/http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/Theres-A-Racket-Brewing-In-the- Code-Signing-Cert-Business/ It is also important to note that code signing does not protect the end user from any malicious activity or unintentional software bugs by the software author ‚Äî it merely ensures that the software has not been modified by anyone other than the author. Sometimes, sandbox systems do not accept certificates, because of a false time-stamp or because of an excess usage of RAM. Implementations Microsoft implements a form of code signing (based on Authenticode) provided for Microsoft tested drivers. Since drivers run in the kernel, they can destabilize the system or open the system to security holes. For this reason, Microsoft tests drivers submitted to its WHQL program. After the driver has passed, Microsoft signs that version of the driver as being safe. On 32-bit systems only, installing drivers that are not validated with Microsoft is possible after accepting to allow the installation in a prompt warning the user that the code is unsigned. For .NET (managed) code, there is an additional mechanism called Strong Name Signing that uses Public/Private keys and SHA-1 hash as opposed to certificates. However, Microsoft discourages reliance on Strong Name Signing as a replacement for Authenticode.Strong Name Bypass: .NET Security Blog  Unsigned code in gaming and consumer devices  In the context of consumer devices such as games consoles, the term \\"unsigned code\\" is often used to refer to an application which has not been signed with the cryptographic key normally required for software to be accepted and executed. Most console games have to be signed with a secret key designed by the console maker or the game will not load on the console. There are several methods to get unsigned code to execute which include software exploits, the use of a modchip, a technique known as the swap trick or running a softmod. It may not initially seem obvious why simply copying a signed application onto another DVD does not allow it to boot. On the Xbox, the reason for this is that the Xbox executable file (XBE) contains a media-type flag, which specifies the type of media that the XBE is bootable from. On nearly all Xbox software, this is set such that the executable will only boot from factory produced discs so simply copying the executable to burnable media is enough to stop the execution of the software. However, since the executable is signed, simply changing the value of the flag is not possible as this alters the signature of the executable causing it to fail validation when checked.

Identification with the terms is not necessarily dependent upon the person's physical appearance or gender expression, or upon the identity of a partner. Etymology and history The term \\"stone butch\\" was popularized by Leslie Feinberg in her 1993 novel Stone Butch Blues, which describes the protagonist's explorations of the lesbian community. A large segment is devoted to the tribulations of being a stone butch person, and the experience of being a lesbian while identifying with masculine traits. Bonnie Zimmerman documents a use of the term to refer to a lesbian who \\"does not allow herself to be touched during lovemaking\\", but may experience vicarious sexual pleasure from her partner's enjoyment. Zimmerman notes that this may have been particularly prevalent in the 1940s and 1950s. Social role The term \\"stone butch\\" has also been used in reference to a subculture or set of mannerisms, as opposed to a statement about sexual behaviour. In this context, \\"stone butch\\" can describe the opposite of \\"femme\\" or \\"high femme\\" attributes, although an individual can identify with both categories. Stone butch identities can overlap with non-binary gender identities and transgender masculine identities among assigned-female lesbians. The sociologist Sara Crawley has written that, while stone butch and masculine transgender identities may share significant characteristics, the primary distinction between the two is that lesbian self-identification prioritizes communicating one's identity to a specifically lesbian audience, whereas transgender masculine self-identification does not. Similarly, Jack Halberstam has contextualised stone butch identities as one of many distinct female masculinities.

While playing for Claremont in the WAFL, he won the 1984 Sandover Medal. Malaxos was an All-Australian with Claremont in 1986 and while he was with the West Coast Eagles in 1988. He was the inaugural fairest and best player at West Coast (1987), holds the Eagles' record for the most possessions in a game (48) and captained the club in 1990. Malaxos was the head coach at East Fremantle, after successfully coaching the colts team to a premiership in 2010. In 2005, he was inducted into the Western Australian Football Hall of Fame. He began his senior career as a forward in 1979, with Claremont, and helped the Tigers rise to power at the beginning of the 1980s. In 1981, Claremont broke scoring records week after week on their way to their first WA(N)FL premiership since 1964, and Malaxos' crumbing was the perfect foil to Warren Ralph. Despite missing a quarter of the season though injury, Malaxos kicked 82 goals and during 1982 was widely tipped to be the second non-full forward to top the century after Kevin Taylor in 1979Young, Doug; 'Malaxos on Target'; The West Australian, 26 April 1982, p. 60 ‚Äì though he finished nine goals short. During 1983 Malaxos was shifted onto the ball to cope with losses to the VFL. The move was a resounding success as he won the club trophy in both 1983 and 1984, becoming Western Australian Sports Star of the Year in 1984, after winning the Sandover. Malaxos was recruited by Hawthorn in the VFL for the following season. He went to Glenferrie Oval as the all-Australian captain, but struggled for an opportunity in the powerful Hawks line-up. Malaxos was a Reserves and night premiership player with the Hawks, but returned to Claremont at the end of the season after playing only nine senior games. At the end of the 1986 season, West Coast, due to enter the VFL competition for the 1987 season added Malaxos to their inaugural list. The Eagles were required to pay the Hawks a $35,000 clearance fee. In Malaxos' inaugural season at West Coast he played 21 games; in round 22, against St. Kilda, he collected his record of 48 possessions. In 1990, Malaxos played 20 games during the home-and-away season, including the club's historic drawn qualifying final against Collingwood, and the replay a week later. Despite being captain, Malaxos was dropped for the remaining finals matches, and replaced as captain by John Worsfold. He did not add to his total of 66 games for West Coast, but was on the club's list for the 1991 season. During 1991, he played his 150th game with Claremont. In 1992, he transferred to East Fremantle. He won three club fairest and best awards with the Sharks, and played in premiership sides in 1992 and 1994. In 1999, Malaxos was appointed as coach of the Sydney Swans reserves team in the AFL. In 2004, Malaxos was appointed to an assistant coach's position with Fremantle in the AFL, a position he left in 2009. Malaxos was inducted into the Western Australian Football Hall of Fame in 2005.

Simonds, Nina. Lowe, Jason. [2005]. The Food of China: A Journey for Food Lovers. Bay Books. . p. 24. The buns are filled with barbecue-flavored cha siu pork. They are served as a type of dim sum during yum cha and are sometimes sold in Chinese bakeries. Cha siu refers to the pork filling; the word bao means \\"bun\\". Varieties There are two major kinds of cha siu bao, the traditional steamed version is called () or simply (), while the baked variety is usually called (). Steamed cha siu bao has a white exterior, while the baked variety is browned and glazed. Cantonese cuisine Although visually similar to other types of steamed baozi, the dough of steamed cha siu bao is unique since it makes use of both yeast and baking powder as leavening.rec.food.recipes Luckytrim, Chinese Pork Buns (Char Siu Bao) RecipeMichelle Che, Chinese Pork Buns (Cha Siu Bao) This unique mix of leavening gives the dough of cha siu bao the texture of a slightly dense, but fine soft bread. Encased in the center of the bun is tender, sweet, slow- roasted pork tenderloin. This cha siu is diced, and then mixed into a syrupy mixture of oyster sauce, hoisin sauce, roasted sesame seed oil, rice vinegar, shaoxing wine or dry sherry, soy sauce, sugar, and cornstarch. Philippine cuisine Siopao (; ), literally meaning \\"hot bun\\", is the Philippine indigenized version of the Cantonese steamed bun called cha siu bao. Polynesian cuisine In Hawaii, the item is called manapua. Its name is a shortening of the Hawaiian mea ono puaa, meaning \\"delicious pork thing\\". On the US mainland, the Chinese term is commonly used. The Chinese immigrants brought this dim sum item with them when they were brought over as plantation workers. In American Samoa and its surrounding islands, the item is referred to as keke pua'a, literally meaning \\"pig cake\\". This food usually consists of a white bun with a dark pink-colored diced pork filling. The Hawaiian version of the cha siu bao tends to be larger than its Chinese cousin and can be either steamed or baked. In Hawaii starting in the plantation era, manapua sellers were and still are a common occurrence and have even become iconic symbols of Hawaii. The red pork filling's dark pink color comes from marinating the pork with a very small amount of saltpeter prior to slow roasting. The bun is occasionally baked, but more frequently is steamed when it is made. Manapua has come to mean any meat-filled or bean-paste-filled bun made with the same dough as described above, including locally-created versions with hot dogs, curry chicken, kalua pig, and even ube (purple yam), which is a popular vegetarian version of the manapua. In Hawaii, freshly prepared or prepackaged frozen manapua may be found in dedicated bakeries, restaurants, and chain convenience stores. In addition to existing in Hawaii, bao buns are also commonly found in Tahiti, French Polynesia. In Tahiti they are called chao pao, and were brought to the islands during the Chinese migration wave dating back to the mid 1800s. Despite its long Tahitian history, the chao pao retains all its authentic characteristics. The chao pao is a local favorite and is commonly sold all over the island in Chinese mom- and-pop stores as a breakfast item.

It is the professional association for solicitors in Victoria, making rules to regulate their practice, and representing them to governments and other bodies. The Institute was founded in 1859. The current President, since 1 January 2019, is Stuart Webb and the current CEO is Adam Awty. History On 22 March 1859, a group of 26 solicitors in Melbourne founded the Institute at a meeting. The first President was David Ogilvy. From 1859, the Institute's offices were located in Collins Street, and in 1883 the offices were relocated to the law courts complex in Lonsdale Street. In 1905, Flos Greig became the first woman to be admitted to practise as a solicitor in Victoria, and shortly after, was the first female member of the Institute. In 1927, the first issue of the Law Institute Journal (LIJ) was published by the Institute. In 1933, the Institute became a constituent member of the newly formed Law Council of Australia. In 1947, the Legal Profession Practice Act 1946, an act of the Parliament of Victoria, officially confirmed the Institute's role as the regulating body for the legal profession in Victoria. By 1948, almost all solicitors in Victoria had become members of the Institute. In 1961 the Institute relocated to premises in Little Bourke Street, but after fire destroyed the building in 1978, the Institute moved to 470 Bourke Street, a site which previously hosted the first meeting of the Victorian Legislative Council on 13 November 1851. In 1991, Gail Owen became the first female President of the Institute. Former Presidents of the Institute include Alfred Brooks Malleson, Arthur Palmer Blake, John Gavan Duffy (brother of Frank and son of Charles), Sir Arthur Robinson, William Slater, Bernard Teague and John Cain II. In 1996, the Legal Profession Practice Act 1946 was replaced by the Legal Practice Act 1996. In 2005, the Legal Practice Act 1996 was repealed and replaced by the Legal Profession Act 2004, the current legislation regulating the legal profession in Victoria. Law Institute Journal The Law Institute Journal (LIJ) is a monthly legal journal published by the Institute. It carries information about changes to the rules of practice, and the rules of the courts, as well as general commentary on legal issues. The first issue was published in July 1927.

She was both cousin to and wife of composer Darius Milhaud. Madeleine Milhaud was born in Paris to Michel and Maria Milhaud. Her father was from Aix-en-Provence, and her mother from Brussels. She began acting at a young age, and had a long career as an actress and reciter. Madeleine married her cousin, Darius Milhaud, in 1925. The couple had one son, Daniel (born 1930 died 2014), a painter. Darius' piano suite La Muse Menag√®re (The Household Muse) is dedicated to her, and depicts their daily life together. She wrote the libretti for his operas M√©d√©e, Bolivar, and La m√®re coupable. The family fled France when the Germans were within range of Paris in May 1940. They reached Lisbon and from there sailed to America, where they and their 10-year-old son stayed for the remainder of the war. Darius taught at Mills College (in California) and Madeleine taught American students about French and French theatre. They returned to France in 1946.

The action of snRNPs is essential to the removal of introns from pre-mRNA, a critical aspect of post- transcriptional modification of RNA, occurring only in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Additionally, U7 snRNP is not involved in splicing at all, as U7 snRNP is responsible for processing the 3‚Ä≤ stem-loop of histone pre- mRNA. The two essential components of snRNPs are protein molecules and RNA. The RNA found within each snRNP particle is known as small nuclear RNA, or snRNA, and is usually about 150 nucleotides in length. The snRNA component of the snRNP gives specificity to individual introns by \\"recognizing\\" the sequences of critical splicing signals at the 5' and 3' ends and branch site of introns. The snRNA in snRNPs is similar to ribosomal RNA in that it directly incorporates both an enzymatic and a structural role. SnRNPs were discovered by Michael R. Lerner and Joan A. Steitz. Thomas R. Cech and Sidney Altman also played a role in the discovery, winning the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1989 for their independent discoveries that RNA can act as a catalyst in cell development.  Types  At least five different kinds of snRNPs join the spliceosome to participate in splicing. They can be visualized by gel electrophoresis and are known individually as: U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6. Their snRNA components are known, respectively, as: U1 snRNA, U2 snRNA, U4 snRNA, U5 snRNA, and U6 snRNA.Weaver, Robert F. (2005). Molecular Biology, p.432-448. McGraw-Hill, New York, NY. . In the mid-1990s, it was discovered that a variant class of snRNPs exists to help in the splicing of a class of introns found only in metazoans, with highly conserved 5' splice sites and branch sites. This variant class of snRNPs includes: U11 snRNA, U12 snRNA, U4atac snRNA, and U6atac snRNA. While different, they perform the same functions as do U1, U2, U4, and U6, respectively. Additionally, U7 snRNP is made of U7 small nuclear RNA and associated proteins and is involved in the processing of the 3‚Ä≤ stem-loop of histone pre-mRNA.  Biogenesis  Small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) assemble in a tightly orchestrated and regulated process that involves both the cell nucleus and cytoplasm. Synthesis and export of RNA in the nucleus The RNA polymerase II transcribes U1, U2, U4, U5 and the less abundant U11, U12 and U4atac (snRNAs) acquire a m7G-cap which serves as an export signal. Nuclear export is mediated by CRM1. Synthesis and storage of Sm proteins in the cytoplasm The Sm proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm by ribosomes translating Sm messenger RNA, just like any other protein. These are stored in the cytoplasm in the form of three partially assembled rings complexes all associated with the pICln protein. They are a 6S pentamer complex of SmD1,SmD2, SmF, SmE and SmG with pICln, a 2-4S complex of SmB, possibly with SmD3 and pICln and the 20S methylosome, which is a large complex of SmD3, SmB, SmD1, pICln and the arginine methyltransferase-5 (PRMT5) protein. SmD3, SmB and SmD1 undergo post- translational modification in the methylosome. These three Sm proteins have repeated arginine-glycine motifs in the C-terminal ends of SmD1, SmD3 and SmB, and the arginine side chains are symmetrically dimethylated to œâ-NG, NG'-dimethyl-arginine. It has been suggested that pICln, which occurs in all three precursor complexes but is absent in the mature snRNPs, acts as a specialized chaperone, preventing premature assembly of Sm proteins. Assembly of core snRNPs in the SMN complex The snRNAs (U1, U2, U4, U5, and the less abundant U11, U12 and U4atac) quickly interact with the SMN (survival of motor neuron protein); encoded by SMN1 gene) and Gemins 2-8 (Gem- associated proteins: GEMIN2, GEMIN3, GEMIN4, GEMIN5, GEMIN6, GEMIN7, GEMIN8) forming the SMN complex. It is here that the snRNA binds to the SmD1-SmD2-SmF- SmE-SmG pentamer, followed by addition of the SmD3-SmB dimer to complete the Sm ring around the so-called Sm site of the snRNA. This Sm site is a conserved sequence of nucleotides in these snRNAs, typically AUUUGUGG (where A, U and G represent the nucleosides adenosine, uridine and guanosine, respectively). After assembly of the Sm ring around the snRNA, the 5' terminal nucleoside (already modified to a 7-methylguanosine cap) is hyper-methylated to 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine and the other (3') end of the snRNA is trimmed. This modification, and the presence of a complete Sm ring, is recognized by the snurportin 1 protein. Final assembly of the snRNPs in the nucleus The completed core snRNP-snurportin 1 complex is transported into the nucleus via the protein importin Œ≤. Inside the nucleus, the core snRNPs appear in the Cajal bodies, where final assembly of the snRNPs take place. This consists of additional proteins and other modifications specific to the particular snRNP (U1, U2, U4, U5). The biogenesis of the U6 snRNP occurs in the nucleus, although large amounts of free U6 are found in the cytoplasm. The LSm ring may assemble first, and then associate with the U6 snRNA. Disassembly of snRNPs The snRNPs are very long-lived, but are assumed to be eventually disassembled and degraded. Little is known about the degradation process. Defective assembly Defective function of the survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein in snRNP biogenesis, caused by a genetic defect in the SMN1 gene which codes for SMN, may account for the motor neuron pathology observed in the genetic disorder spinal muscular atrophy. Structures, function and organization Several human and yeast snRNP structures were determined by the cryo-electron microscopy and successive single particle analysis. Recently, the human U1 snRNP core structure was determined by X-ray crystallography (3CW1, 3PGW), followed by a structure of the U4 core snRNP (2Y9A), which yielded first insights into atomic contacts, especially the binding mode of the Sm proteins to the Sm site. The structure of U6 UsnRNA was solved in complex with a specific protein Prp24 (4N0T), as well as a structure of its 3'-nucleotides bound to the special Lsm2-8 protein ring (4M7A). The PDB codes for the respective structures are mentioned in parenthesis. The structures determined by single particle electron microscopy analysis are: human U1 snRNP, human U11/U12 di-snRNP, human U5 snRNP, U4/U6 di-snRNP, U4/U6‚àôU5 tri- snRNP. The further progress determining the structures and functions of snRNPs and spliceosomes continues. Anti-snRNP antibodies Autoantibodies may be produced against the body's own snRNPs, most notably the anti-Sm antibodies targeted against the Sm protein type of snRNP specifically in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

For example, if one question on a survey is to be answered by a choice among \\"poor\\", \\"fair\\", \\"good\\", and \\"excellent\\", and the purpose of the analysis is to see how well that response can be predicted by the responses to other questions, some of which may be quantitative, then ordered logistic regression may be used. It can be thought of as an extension of the logistic regression model that applies to dichotomous dependent variables, allowing for more than two (ordered) response categories. The model and the proportional odds assumption The model only applies to data that meet the proportional odds assumption, the meaning of which can be exemplified as follows. Suppose the proportions of members of the statistical population who would answer \\"poor\\", \\"fair\\", \\"good\\", \\"very good\\", and \\"excellent\\" are respectively p1, p2, p3, p4, p5. Then the logarithms of the odds (not the logarithms of the probabilities) of answering in certain ways are: : \\\\begin{array}{rll} \\\\text{poor}, & \\\\log\\\\frac{p_1}{p_2+p_3+p_4+p_5}, & 0 [8pt] \\\\text{poor or fair}, & \\\\log\\\\frac{p_1+p_2}{p_3+p_4+p_5}, & 1 [8pt] \\\\text{poor, fair, or good}, & \\\\log\\\\frac{p_1+p_2+p_3}{p_4+p_5}, & 2 [8pt] \\\\text{poor, fair, good, or very good}, & \\\\log\\\\frac{p_1+p_2+p_3+p_4}{p_5}, & 3 \\\\end{array} The proportional odds assumption is that the number added to each of these logarithms to get the next is the same in every case. In other words, these logarithms form an arithmetic sequence. The model states that the number in the last column of the table‚Äîthe number of times that that logarithm must be added‚Äîis some linear combination of the other observed variables. The coefficients in the linear combination cannot be consistently estimated using ordinary least squares. They are usually estimated using maximum likelihood. The maximum-likelihood estimates are computed by using iteratively reweighted least squares. Examples of multiple ordered response categories include bond ratings, opinion surveys with responses ranging from \\"strongly agree\\" to \\"strongly disagree,\\" levels of state spending on government programs (high, medium, or low), the level of insurance coverage chosen (none, partial, or full), and employment status (not employed, employed part-time, or fully employed). Suppose the underlying process to be characterized is :y^{*} = \\\\mathbf{x}^{\\\\mathsf{T}} \\\\beta + \\\\varepsilon, \\\\, where y^{*} is the exact but unobserved dependent variable (perhaps the exact level of agreement with the statement proposed by the pollster); \\\\mathbf{x} is the vector of independent variables, \\\\varepsilon is the error term, and \\\\beta is the vector of regression coefficients which we wish to estimate. Further suppose that while we cannot observe y^{*}, we instead can only observe the categories of response : y= \\\\begin{cases} 0 & \\\\text{if } y^* \\\\le \\\\mu_1, \\\\ 1 & \\\\text{if } \\\\mu_1 where the parameters \\\\mu_i are the externally imposed endpoints of the observable categories. Then the ordered logit technique will use the observations on y, which are a form of censored data on y*, to fit the parameter vector \\\\beta.

Early life After being educated at Perth Academy, Sharp took a degree in English at the University of Aberdeen. Graduating with honours in 1975, he was selected as scholar of the St Andrews Society of New York, and then studied for a Masters at Princeton University combining literature, theatre and politics. Journalism career Having been offered the opportunity to join the BBC's journalistic training programme in 1975, after completing his one- year MA, Sharp joined the BBC in 1976 as a trainee journalist. Upon qualification he became a BBC TV news scriptwriter, and then a reporter for IRN/LBC. After helping to start the independent Radio Tay in Dundee, he then freelanced for mostly British news outlets in California for six years until 1987. Joining BBC News, Sharp was the channel's correspondent in California and the Pacific Northwest.And now for a BBC reporter who is completely different SalemNews.com, 12 June 2009 In 1987 he moved with his wife to London as a reporter for the BBC World Service, then as duty foreign editor at Channel 4 News. Returning to BBC News, when the corporation started the news and sport station Radio 5 (now 5 Live) in 1994, Sharp came up with the idea for the programme Up All Night. Since its launch he has been one of the two regular presenters. The Washington Post once described the show as probably the best night-time radio show in the world. In 2001, Sharp was on the second commercial flight to New York City after 11 September to give in-depth analysis of the aftermath of the terrorist attacks. He also presented 5 Live's programmes on the American presidential and congressional elections. He has become instrumental in giving wider coverage on British radio of sports like baseball and American football, presenting its live broadcasts of the World Series and the Super Bowl. After reporting on the 11 September attacks, while taking a sabbatical, Sharp and his wife fell in love with the fishing town of Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA. From 2004 he presented his editions of the show (Monday to Wednesday) from the town. Initially using the studios and ISDN line of local radio station WESX to connect him to Broadcasting House, London, from 2007 he presented the show from a home studio within the couple's 18th- century property. Broadcasting from the United States made Sharp \\"pretty unique\\" among BBC radio hosts, according to the then BBC deputy news director Stephen Mitchell. In March 2020, after having presented Up All Night for 26 years, Sharp stood down.Rhod Sharp to leave 5 Live after 26 years Up All Night, RadioToday UK, December 17, 2019. Personal life Whilst broadcasting from San Francisco in the early 1980s, Sharp met his future wife Vicki Staveacre. The couple moved to London in the 1980s, where Sharp later created Up All Night. Following 9/11, the couple took a two-month sabbatical in Harvard, Massachusetts. On forays to North Shore, they became enamoured with Marblehead. In 2004, they bought a small apartment in the seaside town, and in 2007 moved to their present home, an 18th-century house in Marblehead's Old Town section. Sharp is the President of the University of Aberdeen USA Trust, and as of 2012 was intending to apply for US citizenship.

It offers admission at ages 11, 13 or 16 (for sixth form). The Good Schools Guide 2013 described Queenswood as \\"a girls' school to which others should aspire.\\" History Two Queenswood School ambulances in Salonika The school's origins were with \\"The Educational Home for the Daughters of Wesleyan Ministers\\" founded in Clapton, London in 1869. After a transfer to Clapham Park the school reopened with its current name in 1894. The head was Marion Waller and she was the daughter of the school's founder Rev David Waller. Marion Waller arrived with Ethel Trew as her assistant. Waller left to marry in 1897 and Trew was persuaded to give up her own ambitions to lead the school. During the first world war the school raised money to fund an ambulance that was sent to Salonika. Under Trew's leadership the school moved to Sheepwell House in Hatfield, Hertfordshire in 1925 and a preparatory school was established. The original school and the head's house was burnt down in 1936 and was replaced with a nearly identical building. Trew had many successes but took too many years to retire in 1944. She was superseded by Enid \\"Emma\\" Essame who had many hours planning the school's future with Baron Stamp, the chair of governors. Essame had been identified as the head designate in the early 1930s and she had turned down other offers in the long wait for Trew to retire. Essame was inspiring to the schjool's supporters and new money was found to support the school. A new science block and library were added in 1957.Essame served until 1971 and she was succeeded by Margaret Ritchie. In 1981 she in her turn was succeeded by Audrey Butler who had been educated at Queenswood. Name The name \\"Queenswood\\" along with the school's motto \\"in hortis regin√¶\\" (In Queens‚Äô Gardens) pays tribute to John Ruskin (1819‚Äì1900) who was a champion on female education and women's place in society. In 1865 he published a lecture \\"Of Quenns' Gardens\\" on which the name and motto were based. The lecture was one of a series \\"Sesame and Lilies\\" delivered in December 1864. Pastoral care As Queenswood is a Methodist school, all girls are required to attend chapel services. Special services are held to welcome new girls and farewell upper sixth leavers. The tutor system is a key part of the school's pastoral care. Girls are organised into small groups and assigned to a tutor or their housemistress.Tutor system House system Trew House Girls in years 7 and 8 belong to Stamp House, which accommodates up to 45 boarders.

However, when he recognized that cameras were able to create realistic images quicker and more accurately than he could, he turned to drawing the creations of his mind. Kidd particularly credits Chesley Bonestell and Norman Rockwell as his most formative influences. Kidd received a scholarship to Syracuse University, but dropped out after two years in the program. He moved to New York City to become a professional artist and, after a difficult start, began to see some success as an illustrator. Since then, Kidd has illustrated two books, The Three Musketeers and The War of the Worlds, and is currently at work on a book called Gnemo: Airships, Adventure, Exploration. A collection of his art, The Tom Kidd Sketchbook, is also available. He has painted the cover artwork for numerous paperback novels published by William Morrow, Random House, Warner Books, Doubleday, St. Martin's Press and Tor Books, as well as Marvel Comics.

Baker, supported the political career of the Springfield-based Abraham Lincoln in the years before the American Civil War; in fact, it was in the Journals office that Lincoln and his friends waited for the telegraphic news from Chicago to find out who would be the Republican presidential nominee in 1860. Later in publication, the name was changed to Illinois State Journal. The cover-price is $2 daily, $4.50 on Sunday. Copley Press bought the State Journal in 1927. In 1942, it bought Springfield's afternoon paper, the Illinois State Register. For years, the two papers maintained separate editorial stances, with the State Journal tilting Republican and the State Register tilting Democratic.Swanson, Walter S. J.

It was established in 1677 by local philanthropists, including Richard Lea, who donated the land for the school, and Francis Welles, who helped to fund the schoolhouse. It was located at Egerton Lodge, Middlewich Road, before moving into a new set of buildings designed by George Gilbert Scott in 1851. It became an independent school in 1945, and a state-funded independent grammar school in 1955. It became a state-funded independent school accepting boys of all abilities in 1979. In 2011, it became one of the country's first free schools. There are 1220 pupils in the school, aged 11‚Äì18. The lower school, years 7 to 11, is entirely boys, however, the sixth form is coeducational. The current headteacher is Sarah Burns, who assumed the role in 2008. In 2011, 96.7% of the students identified as White British, and 6.9% of students had some form of Special Educational Need. Two-thirds of pupils are from the Sandbach and Haslington area, with the remaining third coming from the Crewe area. The school is the largest provider of adult education in the area. History A school existed in Sandbach as early as 1578, when the York visitation returns referred to a schoolmaster in the town. In 1606, the parish register also mentioned a schoolmaster in the town. However, it was not until 1677 when the grammar school proper was founded by Richard Lea, after he gave a piece of land for the schoolhouse. Francis Welles and others paid for the construction of the schoolhouse. In 1718, a deed was drawn up that demonstrated how the school should be managed and gave instructions for the appointment of governors and a master. 20 poor boys of Sandbach were to be educated at the new school, and the second master was likely to have also been the parish curate. By 1816, the school had 60 pupils and was located at Egerton Lodge, Middlewich Road. In 1848, a private Act of Parliament was passed that set out how the school should be better managed. An annual salary of ¬£140 was set for the schoolmaster, and of ¬£60 to the second master. From 1849, the school's buildings were replaced by buildings designed in the early English style by George Gilbert Scott. It entered these new buildings in 1851. By 1890, the school had a laboratory, gymnasium and swimming bath. In 1909, the school acquired eligibility for the Board of Education grants, however, in 1945, the government decided that the school should no longer have direct access to these grants. The governors chose independence rather than becoming a local education authority (LEA) school. The school operated as an independent school until 1955, when it entered into a unique agreement with Cheshire County Council that it would maintain its independence and charitable status but operate as the boys' day grammar school in south-east Cheshire. In 1957, to help to alleviate the shortage of grammar school places in south-east Cheshire, the governors agreed with the local education authority to provide 60 places for boys based on residence, not ability. In 1976, these were increased in 180. In the same year, Sandbach School was first listed as a Grade II Listed building. 1979 saw the school enter into a new agreement with the LEA that it would have an all-ability intake of boys from a defined area of south-east Cheshire. In September 2011, Sandbach School became one of the first 24 free schools to open in the country. School House the original part of the school  School structure  At the last Ofsted inspection, in 2008, the school had 1167 students. In 2011, it was reported the school had 1220 students and was likely to rise to its capacity of 1265 by 2012/13 as a result of \\"organic growth due to rising demographics\\". The main primary school feeders to Sandbach School are Sandbach Primary, Wheelock Primary, Haslington Primary, The Dingle Primary, St John's Primary, Elworth Hall Primary, Elworth C of E Primary and Offley Road Primary. There are six other secondary schools and sixth forms in a five-mile radius: Sandbach High School and Sixth Form College, Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School, Alsager School, Sir William Stanier School, Middlewich High School and Congleton High School.  Lower school  In year 10 and 11, a range of GCSEs and vocational subjects are offered.  Sixth form  At sixth form, the school offers AS-Levels, A-Levels and BTECs.  House System  There are currently four Houses at Sandbach School, which students are grouped into. Brothers are usually placed into the same house, and a student's House can be determined by the colour of the crest on their tie. Four teachers (one for each House) are assigned the role of Head of House. Lea/Red: Head of House - Mr D Roberts Welles/Blue: Head of House - Mrs L Massey Ward/Yellow: Head of House - Miss G Baccelliere Craig/Green: Head of House - Mr M Southern In addition to the Heads of Houses, students are annually given the opportunity to apply for the position of House Captain. The Houses compete to win points each year which determines who will win the House Cup. These events range from a Spelling Bee to a Tug of War, and end with Sports Day in the Summer Term. For a short period of time in the early 1980s, the school had six Houses. These were: Hall (Ward was renamed Hall during this period), Welles, Lea, Craig, Scott and Kent.200px Adult education Sandbach School Adult Education Department is the largest provider of adult education courses in South Cheshire, offering up to 100 courses on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday evenings.Sandbach School Cricket Pavilion Extra-curricular activities The school has a wide range of extra- curricular activities including international mentors, reading club, war games club, languages club, many musical ensembles, drama/theatre, Duke of Edinburgh, rock climbing and many sports clubs. There is also a Combined Cadet Force (CCF) contingent based at the school, which offers the vocational qualification of BTEC First Diploma in Public Service, which is worth four GCSEs in conjunction with the school. The contingent is run by Lt Col R.J. Ayres, a former teacher at the school.  Sports  The school has a number of sports teams, including in rugby union, association football, field hockey, badminton, athletics, cricket, swimming, cross country, and golf. The school has had success playing football in the Cheshire Schools FA competitions. In 2017‚Äì2018, the school won the U14 Hefin Roberts Cup and the U18 Don Ormes Cup for Schools. Historical results include winning the U18 Don Ormes Cup in 2011‚Äì2012, the U13 Redrow Cheshire Cup in 2015‚Äì2016, and the U15 Emberton Cup in 2011‚Äì2012. In 2017, Sandbach School's U13 cricket team won the U13 Hill Hopkins Trophy of the Cheshire Schools Cricket Association, beating Birkenhead School. In 2015, the school won the U12 Campey Cup, beating King's School, Macclesfield. In 2011, the school won the U14 Lord's Taverners' Cricketer Cup, beating King's School, Chester. Drama and performing arts Sandbach School has an international reputation for drama and music, touring to Hong Kong, New Zealand and Brazil, and performing shows in the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. The school was awarded specialist arts college status in 2006. The school's theatrical director is John Lonsdale (awarded an MBE in the 2014 Queen's New Years Honours list); music is led by John Barber (principal trombonist with Foden's Band). The school's theatrical success led to the founding of a separate theatre group, the Ut Severis Seges Theatre Company (named after the school motto). In Edinburgh, the school's 2004 performances of Macbeth and The Madness of King George III both garnered 4-star reviews within the fringe press. Following this, in 2006 the performance of the original play Oedipus, written by former pupil and future teacher Andrew Cargill, was also given a 4-star rating in the magazine Three Weeks. The school also performed Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Ut Severis Seges also toured to the Edinburgh Fringe alongside the school theatre group in 2006, with a production of Amadeus. A third tour of the Edinburgh Fringe took place in 2008, costing ¬£20,000, with a new production of Oh! What A Lovely War, which gained a 5-star review, and 4-star performances by the school's Big Band. The Sandbach School Big Band was formed in 2003. It has toured to Boston, USA and Berlin, and also performed at the finals of the National Jazz Festival 'Music for Youth', at Birmingham Conservatoire, and was a finalist at the 2007 National Festival of Music for Youth. In recent years the group has worked with many of the country's leading musicians including Georgie Fame. The Big Band have been winners of the Cheshire East Schools' Music Competition for the past 3 years (2010 to 2012). Film In 2007 the school hosted the British Youth Film Academy's production of the film The School That Roared, allowing school students a chance to work with film professionals and star in a feature film. International links The school is linked to schools across the world. Sandbach School gained the International Schools Award from the British Council, it has been granted from September 2007 to September 2010. In October 2007 the senior rugby squad toured Italy. Germany The school band toured in Germany in October 2005, and formed a partnership with Leibniz Oberschule in Berlin. Since 2005, an exchange visit to Berlin and regular contact via e-mail and video conferencing has helped Sandbach pupils in their German studies. Hong Kong The school also has a long-term partnership with Fukien Secondary School in Kowloon, Hong Kong where some pupils performed in October 2006 and again - with a performance of \\"The King of Denmark\\" - in 2013. The schools collaborated at the Edinburgh Fringe in an event at the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, where a 50-strong group from Fukien met over 100 Sandbach pupils and staff. Former Sandbach pupils have visited Fukien and taught there during their gap year, and a former Sandbach School teacher has also taught at Fukien. United States Sandbach School has toured to Dover High School in New Hampshire, sending football tours to Dover to play them and other schools in the area. In October 2004 and October 2007, joint football and music tours were arranged. New Zealand The school has a link with the National Youth Drama School, New Zealand.

The Firebird Band Bio *In 2003, Broach met Znavor when they were both part of another band called Life at Sea. Broach joined as a guitarist and keyboardist, and Znavor was already the drummer. *In 2004, Broach left Life at Sea to do a reunion tour for Braid, and then to begin to focus again on finishing The Firebird Band's newest album ‚Äì The City at Night with John Isberg. *In 2005, Znavor moved on and joined as a full-time member in time to play the Vans Warped Tour, CMJ Music Marathon, and a few other high-profile shows that year. At that time, The Firebird Band had just signed on with The Underground Management in NYC. The band remains with The Underground Management to this day. *In 2006, as the band was going through a line-up change, Znavor suggested that they bring on Mike Marsden to complete the new line-up.

There are two styles: uta (song) and hayashi (festival). The uta is properly tuned to the Western scale, and can be played in ensembles or as a solo instrument. The hayashi is not in the correct pitch, because it is simply a piece of hollow bamboo with holes cut into it.

He lived in the Lancaster and Dover areas of England. His book A Description of the Qualifications Necessary to a Gospel Minister is used to inform Quaker ministry to this day. Childhood Samuel Bownas was born in 1676, to Quaker parents, although his father died when he was a month old. His father had been a Friend during the time of Quaker persecution, with meetings of the Friends having been held in his house. Bownas was admitted as a member of Great Strickland (Westmorland) Monthly Meeting as a baby. During his childhood he did not have a great taste for Quakerism or religion at all, although his mother would read accounts of his father's sufferings to him in the evenings, and he went with his mother to meeting and to visit Friends imprisoned in Appleby. He was apprenticed to his uncle as a blacksmith, at the age of 13. Religious conversion In 1696, his life was changed. At this time he was apprenticed to Samuel Parrott, a Friend from Briggflatts meeting in Sedbergh. Attending meeting for worship, another Friend, Anne Wilson rose in worship and accused him of being no better for his attendance of meeting for worship, and that would prove perilous for him \\"in the end\\". Afterwards he felt called to preach and read the Bible with greater ease. His famous A Description of the Qualifications Necessary to a Gospel Minister was first printed in 1750. Having first journeyed to Scotland, he sailed for America aboard the Josiah, John Sowden, master. He landed two months later in Potuxant River, Maryland about 29 May 1702, and continued his work.

In most countries, ISO/IEC 17025 is the standard for which most labs must hold accreditation in order to be deemed technically competent. In many cases, suppliers and regulatory authorities will not accept test or calibration results from a lab that is not accredited. Originally known as ISO/IEC Guide 25, ISO/IEC 17025 was initially issued by the International Organization for Standardization in 1999. There are many commonalities with the ISO 9000 standard, but ISO/IEC 17025 is more specific in requirements for competence and applies directly to those organizations that produce testing and calibration results and is based on somewhat more technical principles.. Laboratories use ISO/IEC 17025 to implement a quality system aimed at improving their ability to consistently produce valid results. It is also the basis for accreditation from an accreditation body. There have been three releases; in 1999, 2005 and 2017. The most significant changes between the 1999 and 2005 release were a greater emphasis on the responsibilities of senior management, explicit requirements for continual improvement of the management system itself, and communication with the customer. It also aligned more closely with the 2000 version of ISO 9001 The 2005 version of the standard comprises five elements; Normative References, Terms and Definitions, Management Requirements, and Technical Requirements. Management requirements are primarily related to the operation and effectiveness of the quality management system within the laboratory. Technical requirements include factors that determine the correctness and reliability of the tests and calibrations performed in the laboratory. The 2017 version of ISO/IEC 17025 has modified this structure to be Scope, Normative References, Terms and Definitions, General Requirements, Structural Requirements, Resource Requirements, Process Requirements, and Management System Requirements. General Requirements and Structural Requirements are related to the organization of the laboratory itself. Structure Requirements cite those issues related to the people, plant, and other organizations used by the laboratory to produce its technically valid results. Process Requirements are the heart of this version of the standard in describing the activities to ensure that results are based on accepted science and aimed at technical validity. Management System Requirements are those steps taken by the organization to give itself quality management system tools to support the work of its people in the production of technically valid results. Predecessors Some national systems (e.g. UKAS M10 in the UK) were the forerunners of ISO/IEC 17025:1999 but could also be exceedingly prescriptive. ISO/IEC 17025 allows laboratories to carry out procedures in their own ways, but require the laboratory to justify using a particular method. In common with other ISO quality standards, ISO/IEC 17025 requires continual improvement. Additionally, the laboratory will be expected to keep abreast of scientific and technological advances in relevant areas. In common with other accreditation standards of the ISO 17000 series (and unlike most ISO standards for management systems), assessment of the laboratory is normally carried out by the national organization responsible for accreditation. Laboratories are therefore \\"accredited\\" under ISO/IEC 17025, rather than \\"certified\\" or \\"registered\\" by a third party service as is the case with ISO 9000 quality standard. In short, accreditation differs from certification by adding the concept of a third party (Accreditation Body (AB)) attesting to technical competence within a laboratory in addition to its adherence and operation under a documented quality system, specific to a Scope of Accreditation. Accreditation bodies In order for accreditation bodies to recognize each other's accreditations, the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) worked to establish methods of evaluating accreditation bodies against another ISO/CASCO standard (ISO/IEC Guide 58 - which became ISO/IEC 17011). Around the world, geo-political regions such as the European Community, and Asia-Pacific, the Americas and others, established regional cooperations to manage the work needed for such mutual recognition. These regional bodies (all working within the ILAC umbrella) include European Accreditation Cooperation (EA), the Asia Pacific Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (APLAC), Southern Africa Accreditation Cooperation (SADCA) and the Inter-American Accreditation Cooperation (IAAC). The first laboratory accreditation bodies to be established were National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) in Australia (1947) and TELARC in New Zealand (1973). Most other bodies are based on the NATA/TELARC model include UKAS in the UK, FINAS in Finland and DANAK in Denmark to name a few. In the U.S. there are several, multidisciplinary accreditation bodies that serve the laboratory community. These bodies accredit testing and calibration labs, reference material producers, PT providers, product certifiers, inspection bodies, forensic institutions and others to a multitude of standards and programs. These ILAC MRA signatory accreditation bodies carry identical acceptance across the globe. It does not matter which AB is utilized for accreditation. The MRA arrangement was designed with equal weight across all economies. ABs include: * The ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board and their recent acquisitions of L-A-B and ASCLD- LAB which are now both [http://www.anab.org/ ANAB * The American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) * Perry Johnson Laboratory Accreditation (PJLA) * American Industrial Hygiene Association * International Accreditation Service, Inc. (IAS) * National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) - technically part of the US government and only accredits a few narrow disciplines * American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors-Laboratory Accreditation Board (ASCLD-LAB) which is now ANAB (see above). In Canada, there are two accreditation bodies: * Standards Council of Canada * The Canadian Association for Laboratory Accreditation The accreditation of calibration laboratories is the shared responsibility of the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) Program for the Accreditation of Laboratories-Canada (PALCAN), and the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) Calibration Laboratory Assessment Service (CLAS). The CLAS program provides quality system and technical assessment services and certification of specific measurement capabilities of calibration laboratories in support of the Canadian National Measurement System. In other countries there is often only one Accreditation Body. Typically these bodies encompass accreditation programs for management systems, product certification, laboratory, inspection, personnel and others: * National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) (India) * Komite Akreditasi Nasional (KAN) (Indonesia) * Irish National Accreditation Board (INAB) (Ireland) * International Accreditation New Zealand (IANZ) (New Zealand) * Dutch Accreditation Council (DAC) (The Netherlands) * Bureau of Accreditation (BoA) (Vietnam) * Korea Laboratory Accreditation Scheme (KOLAS) (South Korea) * DAkkS (Germany) See also * List of ISO standards * ISO 17025 Documents *Quality management system *Measurement uncertainty References External links  * 17025:2017 General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories Category:Quality control #17025 ","title":"ISO/IEC 17025"},{"id":"3768179","text":"Jared Poulton (born 21 April 1977) is a former Australian rules footballer in the Australian Football League.

These services have a wide variety of forms, creating a spectrum from typical Protestant liturgy (one extreme of programmed worship) to silent waiting for the Spirit (called unprogrammed worship). A Meeting for Worship may start with a query; something to think about during Meeting. The query is most of the time based on one of the Quaker testimonies. Meeting will then sit in silence for varying amounts of time, but usually from twenty minutes to an hour and a half. If an attendee is provoked to share, they can stand up and speak their mind, usually but not always with regards to the query. Attendees are encouraged to speak once \\"the Spirit finds you\\", thus meaning one should only speak if the message is good for the community and beneficial to the meeting. A traditional Quaker belief is everyone has \\"that of God\\" inside, and everyone's inner light and spirit can be shown. At a few meetings, some people will stand up and sing songs or recite poetry. In Britain Within the United Kingdom, the vast majority of Quaker worship is unprogrammed. In America In the United States, Friends' worship is conducted in a variety of ways that form more of a continuum than a set number of possible formats or styles. Currently, there are Meetings that belong to and follow the traditions of specific branches of the Religious Society of Friends, and there are independent Friends' meetings, worship groups and churches. Pastoral meetings, as the name implies, have a pastor or minister whose job is to lead worship and preach. These meetings may have choirs and patterns of liturgy, similar to Protestant church services. Unprogrammed meetings also vary. Depending on the backgrounds and beliefs of members and attenders, there can be a difference in how Friends approach the meeting. Some emphasize the benefit of stillness and contemplation, while others emphasise listening. Of those that are concerned with listening, there are different understandings of to whom or to what Friends are listening. When the word \\"meeting\\" is used, as it is here, the reference is to a \\"monthly meeting\\", so called because meeting for business is held every month. This can be confusing because meeting for worship is typically held every week. However this is important in the structure of the Quaker faith. Meetings (monthly meetings) do not stand alone, but the vast majority of meetings belong to a \\"yearly meeting\\". Most yearly meetings have a book of, not quite doctrine, but an outline of belief, to which the monthly meetings that belong at least generally adhere to. For instance, most ‚Äì but not all ‚Äì meetings in New England belong to New England Yearly Meeting and subscribe to the Faith and Practice published by New England Yearly Meeting. There are terms, Inner Light, Guide, Seed, or Spirit (or some variation) used by many Friends to explain the source of what they may say or reflect upon during meeting. These terms also have different shades of meaning depending upon the meeting's background. Conservative Friends consider Jesus to be that Seed or Guide. Others have a more general concept of something within each person that encourages the good. In meeting for worship among Conservative Friends, someone speaks when that person feels that God has given them a message for others. After anyone speaks (or sings or recites a scripture passage), several minutes are allowed to pass before anyone else speaks, to allow the message to be considered carefully. Friends should not answer or argue during meeting for worship. Among other types of Friends' meetings for worship, the explanation of the source of what is spoken depends upon the person speaking. Some may believe it is God who prompted them to speak. Some explain an inward prompt, but they may be unable to say precisely from where. Some explain that there is a collective spiritual wisdom that is speaking through them. These are just examples, not a comprehensive list. At times unprogrammed meetings may wander from the generally accepted guidelines. If this is a problem in a specific meeting it may be raised with a member of the committee for Ministry and Worship. Unprogrammed meetings may have a time after the end of the meeting for worship (called the rise of meeting) for Friends and attenders to speak about something that occurred to them during meeting, but may not have seemed like something to share during the meeting.

Most people have D.folliculorum on their skin. Usually, the mites do not cause any harm, and are therefore considered an example of commensalism rather than parasitism. If D.folliculorum does cause disease, this is known as demodicosis. Anatomy D. folliculorum is adapted to live inside hair follicles, and therefore is thin and worm-like, with short legs. As an adult, D.folliculorum measures long. Adults have four pairs of legs, larvae and nymphs have only three pairs. D.folliculorum has a rudimentary gut, and no anus. Reproduction and life cycle The entire life cycle of D.folliculorum takes 14‚Äì16 days. Adult mites copulate at the top of the hair follicle, near the skin surface. Eggs are deposited in the sebaceous gland inside the hair follicle. The heart-shaped egg is long, and hatches into a six-legged larva. It takes seven days for the larva to develop into a mature adult, with two intervening nymph stages. The adult lives for 4‚Äì6 days.  Ecology  Demodex folliculorum prefers areas where sebum production is high, and is typically found in hair follicles on the human face, generally in greater numbers around the cheeks, nose, and forehead, but also elsewhere on the face, eyelids and ears. The mites may also be found on other parts of the body, such as the chest and buttocks. Within the hair follicle, D. folliculorum is found above the sebaceous gland, positioned head downward, with the end of abdomen often protruding from the hair follicle. Infested follicles usually contain 2‚Äì6 mites, but greater numbers can occur. In one hour, D. folliculorum can travel ; the mites usually travel at night. The mites are obligate commensals of humans, and can only live on the skin; they soon dry out and die if they leave the host. Higher numbers of D.folliculorum are found in the spring and summer than at other times of the year.  Relationship with humans  D. folliculorum are not found on newborn babies, but are acquired shortly after birth, most likely due to maternal contact. Few mites are found on children under ten years of age, but nearly all elderly people are infested. The increasing population over time may be due to a small initial infestation gradually growing over time, or may be because levels of the mite's food, sebum, increase with age. High numbers of D. folliculorum are associated with blepharitis and acne rosacea. The exact mechanism by which the mites cause disease is unknown; they may physically block the hair follicle, carry disease-causing bacteria, or, after death, their bodies may cause either a delayed hypersensitivity response, or an innate immune response. There is controversy over whether high numbers of D. folliculorum cause rosacea, or whether the skin environment caused by rosacea is more hospitable to mites than normal skin, allowing them to flourish. Populations of D. folliculorum are also increased in people with immunosuppression.  History  The first report of Demodex folliculorum was made by German scientist Jakob Henle in 1841, but his presentation to the Natural Sciences Society of Zurich, reported in a local newspaper, attracted little attention at the time. In 1842, German dermatologist Gustav Simon gave a full report of the appearance of Demodex folliculorum, naming it Acarus folliculorum. The following year, 1843, the genus was named Demodex by English scientist Richard Owen. From Simon's initial description of D.folliculorum onwards, two forms were recognized, a long form and a short form. In 1963, it was suggested that these long and short forms were two subspecies of D.folliculorum, and that the smaller mite be named Demodex brevis, with the larger mite retaining the name D. folliculorum. It was not until 1972 that the existence of two separate species was confirmed.

The game supposedly became popular in the pirate coves of the Caribbean. With its very simple concept, this game of strategy gives each player a group of six pirates and the objective is to have all six escape through the tortuous underground passage that connects the fortress to the port, where a sloop is waiting for them. Gameplay The first player to move all of his or her pirates from the Cartagena prison to the sloop is the winner. Set-Up The game board and its pieces were designed by Leo Colovini and drawn by artists Christoph Clasen, Claus Stephan, Didier Guiserix, Martin Hoffmann, and Studio Tapiro. The board itself is made up of six double-sided sections, each of which has a different permutation of the same six pictures: daggers, pirate hats, pistols, bottles of rum, skulls, and skeleton keys. These six sections can be combined in any order, to make thousands of different games (although nowhere near as many as the 7206 combinations theoretically possible). Each player is dealt six cards out of a set of 102: 17 cards for each of the six pictures. Each also begins the game with six pirates, represented by solid- coloured, wooden figures. Colour choices include brown, red, yellow, green, and blue. The player who looks most like a pirate goes first, with gameplay proceeding in a clockwise direction. Turns Cartagena During one's turn, a player can make between one and three moves. Each move sees one of the player's pirate going either forward or backward. Pirates are moved forward by playing the cards in their hand. New cards can only be obtained by moving backward. To move forward, the player selects a pirate. plays a card, and moves that pirate forward to the next unoccupied square with the same picture as the card. If there are no unoccupied spaces ahead, the pirate moves to the sloop. To move backward, the player selects a pirate and moves it back to the closest square with one or two pirates. If that square has one pirate, the player draws one card; if it has two pirates, the player draws two. Pirates cannot be moved all the way back to Cartagena. Variations The game can be played in two variants: Jamaica, in which the deck is hidden and players cannot see each other's cards, and Tortuga, in which the cards are visible. The game plays quite differently in the two versions. Jamaica games tend to be fast-paced (30‚Äì45 minutes), and involve both skill and luck. Tortuga games involve much less luck; the game is simple enough that the winner is usually the player who can perform the deepest analysis. Series A published sequel to the game, Cartagena II, was released in 2006. It follows the storyline of the original game, with the pirates working to figure out what to do now that they have escaped the prison. It is based on the same card-based movement mechanism but introduces additional gameplay elements. In particular, the board is divided into two islands, and pirates are ferried from one to the other on a single boat. Cartagena: Die Goldinsel was released in 2008 by a different designer, R√ºdiger Dorn and published only by Winning Moves Germany. This game sees the pirates searching for Treasure Island, after having escaped the fortress of Cartagena and returned to the Pirates' Nest in the previous two games. Players take on the role of pirate captains and try to get together a new crew of pirates, gather Island cards and acquire digging rights before setting sail to Treasure Island. Cartagena: Die Meuterei was released in 2009. This game too was published by Winning Moves but was designed by Michael Rieneck. The saga of Cartagena continues with the first signs of a mutiny emerging after a long calm. Players try to equip with gold and weapons and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of other players in order to obtain the most gold and thus win the game. A new version of Cartagena was released in 2017 that includes both the classic base game mixed with Cartagena 2: The Pirate's Nest, and several new variants. http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/224031/cartagena Cartagena can also be played online in real-time at BrettspielWelt. There are two turn-based online versions available at Youplay.it and Cartagena Online. Category Cartagena is generally categorized as a race game. It is much shorter and simpler than Hare and Tortoise, which is often considered the exemplar of race games. It is usually played as a light time-killer rather than a serious competition. However, it is much more complicated and requires much more skill (even in the Jamaica variant) than children's race games like Snakes and Ladders. It is also has been categorized as a family game and a pirates game. For its mechanics, it has been grouped with modular board games as well as hand management games. Also, its lack of necessary in-game text makes it accessible to non-English speakers. The fact that each player has six pieces and three moves per turn makes the strategy somewhat different from most other games. Therefore, it has been very well received by casual gamers.

Developed by Oberon Media for Microsoft, it was introduced in Windows Vista and is also included in Windows 7. It was no longer available starting with Windows 8.  History  Purble Place was publicly introduced in Windows Vista build 5219, along with Chess Titans and Mahjong Titans.  Games in Purble Place  The collection has a single home screen that offers three packs of games: Purble Pairs, Comfy Cakes, and Purble Shop. Purble Pairs is a pattern recognition and memory game similar to Concentration. The object is to clear the tableau in the fewest turns. As the skill level progresses, the game becomes timed, the grid size increases, and more similar pictures are used. The Beginner level has one 5x5 grid, Intermediate has two 6x6 grids, and Advanced has four 8x8 grids to solve per game (Shamrocks, hearts, smiley faces or gumdrops). In addition to a jester that automatically finds another match of an exposed card, numerous special pairs are present in the higher levels: such as a card of the cake batter station in Comfy Cakes that shuffles the board when paired, a clock that adds more time to the timer, and a Comfy Cakes Chef that automatically finds and matches pairs of cards containing cakes. A sneak peek coin bonus allows the player to expose all remaining cards for a couple of seconds, but every card exposed in this way is counted as a turn. This game is not available in v0.4. Comfy Cakes is a hand-eye coordination game. The object is to fill orders in a bakery by assembling a cake to match a given cake specification on the TV, by controlling a conveyor belt that brings the cake to various stations. Elements of the cake include cake pan shapes (square, circular or heart-shaped), flavor of batter (strawberry, chocolate or vanilla), 3 cake layerings (Red, green or white), optional icing (strawberry, chocolate or vanilla), and other decorations (e.g. sugar may be sprinkled on top of the cake, and in rarer cases, flames are applied to iced cakes to create a smooth glaze). If the cake does not match the specification on the TV, the player is penalized and the cake gets thrown in the trash. If the player sends two or three incorrect orders, the game is over. After a certain number of correct orders are shipped in the box, the player wins the game, and the score is tabulated. The final score depends upon the number of cakes baked, the number of incorrect orders sent and the efficiency of the player in baking. At higher levels the specifications become more complex and multiple cakes must be manufactured in parallel on a single conveyor belt. The player makes about 5 or 6 cakes in one of the difficulty levels. When you do not get the features in the plastic paper, the computer tells you the move is not allowed. One of 3125 possible looks for a purble with five features Purble Shop is a code-breaker game. The computer decides the color of up to five features (topper, eyes, nose, mouth and clothes) that are concealed from the player. you can choose from an assortment of colors (Red, purple, yellow, blue or green), and a color can be used once, several times or not used. The player then attempts to deduce or guess the right feature colors in a limited number of guesses (not available in beginner difficulty). There are three difficulty levels: Beginner with three features in three possible colors; 33 = 27 different possible solutions, Intermediate with 44 = 256 solutions, and Advanced with 55 = 3125 solutions. The beginner and intermediate levels are guessing games where after each move the computer tells the player which items were right, so there is little scope for deduction. At the advanced level the computer doesn't tell the player which specific items were right, reporting only the count of picks in the right color and position, and the count of picks in the right color but the wrong position. This level is similar to the colored peg game Mastermind where success requires logical reasoning (although, there is a small chance of succeeding through lucky guesses).

It works, until that Robert Jade a rebellious and attractive new student comes into the picture and begins to turn Georges' belief system upside-down. While Georges tries hard to get along with everyone, Robert doesn't care who he annoys. Compelled to shatter Georges' angelic image, Robert can't help but test the younger boy's faith and innocence, which he both hates and admires. However, Georges and Robert are more similar than either realizes, and are soon berated by jealous and protective classmates, yet the two find themselves forming a friendship that will transform them both. Characters ;Georges Saphir :Georges is an angel-faced do-gooder student at an all-boys' religious academy. He is known for his kind-heart, soft voice and angelic manners. He is always surrounded by friends, though seems to keep most distanced to an extent. Until Robert shows up and confronts him, Georges keeps his pain confined inside himself about his reasons and true nature. Robert finally draws out of him that Georges doesn't want to be hated, and you learn by the end of the first volume that he is like so because he doesn't want to be a shadow of his father, who was well known for being a cruel and malicious man. ;Robert Jade :Robert is an enigmatic and handsome transfer student to the academy. He seems to have a hobby for harassing Georges. He draws out a lot of hidden emotions and feelings from the blond in his malicious trouble-making. But Robert also is revealed to have a dark past of his own when Alain, an enemy from the past, draws out old memories of a lost love whose death is blamed on Robert. This person was an angelic, pure sort, just like Georges. Robert is the son of the academy's principal. ;Henri Quartz :Henri is one of Georges better friends and seems to often appear around the blond. They hang together and attend classes together, though, like everyone else, Georges still draws a line between the two of them. Henri seems defensive over Georges and openly is suspicious and confrontational toward Robert about his harassing Georges. ;Sir Freddy :Frederic is a royal figure who is held in high-regards because of his silver hair. Though this has spoiled him, it has also crushed him, causing him to be cold and alone. He is set up to be \\"official friends\\" with Georges by his father and the principal. This affects Georges negatively, since Freddy has taken him in as a gopher-boy, too.

The National Bravery Awards are presented annually at Farmleigh by the Ceann Comhairle, the chair of the council. Members The council has listed seven members, of whom four constitute a quorum: * the Ceann Comhairle of D√°il √âireann, the chair of the council * the Cathaoirleach of Seanad √âireann * the chairperson of the Central Council of the Irish Red Cross * the Lord Mayor of Dublin * the Lord Mayor of Cork * the chairperson of the Association of County and City Councils (formerly called the General Council of County Councils) * the commissioner of the Garda S√≠och√°na. The secretary of the council is a civil servant in the Department of Justice and Equality. History Comhairle na M√≠re Gaile was established by the Deeds of Bravery Act, 1947. The concept was introduced on a non-statutory basis in June 1945, when a committee was formed with the same members who would later form Comhairle na M√≠re Gaile. A supplementary estimate of ¬£250 was authorised for the Minister of Justice to fund the scheme's inaugural year, including the travel expenses of honorees to √Åras an Uachtar√°in to receive their awards from the President.Committee on Finance. ‚Äì Vote 32‚ÄîOffice of the Minister for Justice D√°il debates Vol.97 cc.1716‚Äì29, 27 June 1945 James Dillon proposed that the Council of State should be the competent body rather than a new committee. Originally the President was to present the highest award, the Gold Medal; other awards were presented by the local district court judge, or the mayor if the deed was in a city or borough. In recent years, all awards are presented in an annual ceremony by the Ceann Comhairle. The first Gold Medal was presented in 1956. Nine more were presented between 1992 and 2010. Awards Acts of bravery are eligible for recognition if committed in Ireland or on an Irish-registered ship. Defence Forces personnel are not eligible for acts performed while on active service; however the Defence Forces have their own medals and awards, beginning with the medal issued to participants in the Easter Rising in 1941, on its 25th anniversary. Garda√≠ are eligible for Comhairle awards, although the Scott Medal is the Garda S√≠och√°na's own highest award for valour. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) reached an agreement with the state in 1948 whereby Comhairle na M√≠re Gaile would not make awards to RNLI personnel and the RNLI would not make awards to others for deeds which had already been recognised by Comhairle na M√≠re Gaile. The medal may be awarded in gold, silver or bronze, with ribbons respectively coloured green, red, or blue, in each case with two white stripes. The medal was designed by Richard King after an open competition. From 1945 to September 2010, the council awarded 10 gold, 68 silver, and 261 bronze medals; 1,468 certificates; and nine letters of commendation.

To take the prevailing visibility, controllers reference a number of visual reference points: usually buildings, hills, or other geographic features. The value obtained is usually reported on a METAR and recorded on the ATIS. In Canada, it is the maximum visibility value common to sectors comprising one- half or more of the horizon circle. The horizon circle may be divided into as many sections as required based on differing visibilities. When the prevailing visibility is less than 4 miles, or goes from less than 4 miles to four miles or greater, tower personnel are required to take a prevailing visibility reading. If this reading differs from the ground reading (i.e., different readings for different heights), the lower value of the two is used for aircraft operations. Also visibility is defined as greatest distance at which an object of specified characteristics can be seen and identified by an observer with normal flight under normal condition in daylight.

Biography Born in K≈çchi city Tosa Province (present day K≈çchi Prefecture), Shimamura entered the 7th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy following the Boshin War. Graduating at the top of his class of 30 cadets in 1880, he served as midshipman on the corvette , as ensign on the ironclad warship , and as a sub- lieutenant and lieutenant on the corvette . Selected for staff work, Shimamura served as a junior officer for several years during the mid-1880s. Studying abroad in Great Britain, he served as a foreign naval observer with the Royal Navy from 1888 to 1891. After his return to Japan, he was assigned as chief gunnery officer on the . He was promoted to lieutenant commander in 1894. During the First Sino-Japanese War, Shimamura was assigned as a staff officer of the Standing Fleet from August 1894 to April 1895 and involved in planning the column formations of the battle. He was later wounded while on board the cruiser during the Battle of the Yalu on September 17, 1894.Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, p. 352. After serving in various staff positions after the war, (including naval attach√© to Italy in 1894) Shimamura was promoted to captain in 1899 and commanded the cruiser and marines during the Battle of Tientsin during the Boxer Rebellion. From 1902-1903, he was captain of the battleship . Promoted to rear admiral on June 6, 1904, shortly before the Russo-Japanese War, Shimamura was made Chief of Staff of the 1st Fleet. In command of the 2nd Fleet's Second Battle Division, Shimamura was aboard his flagship, the cruiser during the Battle of Tsushima on May 26, 1905. After the war, he was assigned command of the Training Fleet and became Commandant of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy from 1906-1908. He became Commandant of the Naval War College (Japan) from 1908-1909. He was subsequently Commander in Chief of the 2nd Fleet from 1909‚Äì1911, Commander in Chief of the Sasebo Naval District from 1911‚Äì1914, and Chief of the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff during World War I from 1914-1920. Shimamura was initially opposed to the deployment of the Imperial Japanese Navy to the Mediterranean under the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, as he felt that this would weaken Japan's defenses against the \\"true threat\\" of the United States.Rising Sun in the Mediterranean Promoted to full admiral on August 28, 1915, Shimamura was ennobled as a danshaku (baron) under the kazoku peerage system in 1916. Following his death in 1923, Shimamura was posthumously promoted to the rank of Marshal Admiral. His grave is at the Aoyama Cemetery in Tokyo.

Early life and friend of Arnold Schoenberg  Back was born in 1874 in Lvov (then Lemberg, capital of Austrian Galica) to Jewish parents. As a boy, Bach was a close friend of the young Arnold Schoenberg, who later named him as one of the three friends (the other two were Oskar Adler and Alexander von Zemlinsky) who greatly influenced him in his youthful explorations of music and literature. Describing him as \\"A linguist, a philosopher, a connoisseur of literature, and a mathematician\\" as well as \\"a good musician\\", Schoenberg paid tribute to his friend by claiming that it was D.J. Bach who furnished his character with \\"the ethical and moral power needed to withstand vulgarity and commonplace popularity\\" ('My Evolution', 1949).  Early studies and career  After studying Natural Sciences at the University of Vienna, where he was influenced by Ernst Mach, D.J. Bach became a journalist, being appointed as music critic of the Arbeiter-Zeitung ('Worker's Newspaper') in 1904 after the death of Josef Scheu (1841‚Äì1904). As a loyal supporter of Schoenberg and of the slightly older Gustav Mahler he supported contemporary music in a city where performances of 'modern' works would sometimes be disrupted by noisy protests.  Socialist  An active socialist dedicated to making the arts accessible to the working classes, it was D.J. Bach who instituted the Arbeiter-Symphonie-Konzerte ('Workers' Symphony Concerts') in Vienna in 1905. His wide-ranging activities earned him the hostility of right-wing groups, who denounced his artistic programme as part of a 'Jewish conspiracy' to undermine traditional Austrian culture. Such accusations were all the more vehement because D.J. Bach was also one of the earliest members of the Vienna Psychoanalytical Association which met under the aegis of Sigmund Freud and whose members were mostly Jewish.  Editor-in-chief of the Arbeiter-Zeitung  D.J. Bach was made editor-in-chief of the literature and art section of the Arbeiter-Zeitung in 1917. Once the Social Democratic Party came to power in 1919, however, he became highly influential politically. Immediately appointed Director of the Sozialdemokratische Kunststelle ('Social-Democratic Arts Council'), he was able to develop a dynamic programme of cultural events as an integral part of the programme of socialist reconstruction in so-called 'Red Vienna'. He organized readings for the workers of Vienna by the satirist Karl Kraus; in 1933, commissioned a painting by Oskar Kokoschka of the Wilhelminenberg Kinderheim, with its panoramic view of the City of Vienna; and invited the avant-garde stage designer Frederick Kiesler to construct a full-sized experimental stage ‚Äì the ‚ÄòRaumb√ºhne‚Äô ‚Äì in the Konzerthaus. The organization of the Theatre and Music Festival of the City of Vienna in 1924 was one of the high points of his career. But he also ‚Äì year in, year out ‚Äì made major musical and theatrical productions available to working-class audiences through a system of subsidized block bookings. In order to help the Workers to be better prepared for the Concerts, Operas or Plays they were planning to attend, from 1926 to 1931, the 'Kunststelle' issued a monthly Arts' magazine, 'Kunst und Volk', in which distinguished contributors from all around Europe discussed not only the artistic events in question, but also a broad range of historical, political and social matters.  Music  Music was, and remained, his central focus, and it was he who founded the amateur Vienna Singverein ('Vienna Choral Society') in 1919. This organisation, together with the Arbeiter-Symphonie-Konzerte and the 'Workers' Music Conservatoire', flourished until all were disbanded upon the new fascist government's outlawing of the Social Democratic Party and imposition of an authoritarian constitution in 1934. Anton Webern was active as a conductor of all musical organisations, and developed a close and enduring friendship with D.J. Bach: it was Bach who delivered the address which opened the concert of Webern's music given on 3 December 1933 to celebrate the composer's fiftieth birthday, and Bach who persuaded Webern not to resign from his position as president of the Vienna International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM) chapter when his projected performance of Alban Berg's opera Wozzeck in Florence in 1934 was cancelled for political reasons.  Cultural politics  D.J. Bach can be said to have held a unique position in the cultural politics of Vienna. In a situation of increasing polarization between 'Right' and 'Left', he attempted to create a cultural consensus by including conservatives like Hofmannsthal and Kralik in his system of patronage, as well as radicals like Ernst Fischer and Alban Berg. The esteem in which he was held by the Viennese cultural community is reflected in the collection of eighty-eight large-format literary, artistic and musical dedications in a \\"Kassette\\" presented to him in August 1924 on the occasion of his fiftieth birthday. This collection, now in the care of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, includes original artistic works of considerable value and forms a unique 'time capsule' of Viennese cultural life.  Move to London and death  In 1939 David Bach, his wife Gisela and nephew Herbert, emigrated to London. In England he became a leading member of the Austrian Labour Club and President of the Union of Austrian Journalists. He continued to organize musical events, particularly concerts of chamber music, supported by members of the future Amadeus Quartet. Bach died in London in 1947.

By contrast, static timing analysis computes the delays of entire paths, using delay calculation to determine the delay of each gate and wire. There are many methods used for delay calculation for the gate itself. The choice depends primarily on the speed and accuracy required: :*Circuit simulators such as SPICE may be used. This is the most accurate, but slowest, method. :*Two dimensional tablesE.-Y. Chung, B.-H. Joo, Y.-K. Lee, K.-H. Kim and S.-H. Lee, ‚ÄúAdvanced delay analysis method for submicron ASIC technology,‚Äù in Proc. IEEE 5th Int. ASIC Conf. 1992, pp. 471-474. are commonly used in applications such as logic synthesis, placement and routing. These tables take an output load and input slope, and generate a circuit delay and output slope. :*A very simple model called the K-factor model is sometimes used. This approximates the delay as a constant plus k times the load capacitance. :*A more complex model called Delay Calculation Language,IEEE standard including DCL or DCL, calls a user-defined program whenever a delay value is required. This allows arbitrarily complex models to be represented, but raises significant software engineering issues. :*Logical effort provides a simple delay calculation that accounts for gate sizing and is analytically tractable. Similarly there are many ways to calculate the delay of a wire. The delay of a wire will normally be different for each destination. In order of increasing accuracy (and decreasing speed), the most common methods are: :*Lumped C. The entire wire capacitance is applied to the gate output, and the delay through the wire itself is ignored. :*Elmore delay*W. C. Elmore, , Journal of Applied Physics, January 1948, Volume 19, Issue 1, pp. 55-63. is a simple approximation, often used where speed of calculation is important but the delay through the wire itself cannot be ignored. It uses the R and C values of the wire segments in a simple calculation. The delay of each wire segment is the R of that segment times the downstream C. Then all delays are summed from the root. (This assumes the network is tree structured, true of most nets in chips. In this case the Elmore delay can be calculated in time O(N) with two tree traversals. If the network is not tree structured the Elmore delay can still be computed, but involves matrix calculations.) :*Moment matching is a more sophisticated analytical method. It can be thought of as either matching multiple moments in the time domain, or finding a good rational approximation (a Pad√© approximation) in the frequency domain. (These are very closely related - see Laplace transform.) It can also be thought of a generalization of Elmore delay, which matches the first moment in the time domain (or computes a one- pole approximation in the frequency domain - they are equivalent). The first use of this technique, AWE,*Pillage, L.T.; Rohrer, R.A., used explicit moment matching. Newer methods such as PRIMA*Odabasioglu, A.; Celik, M.; Pileggi, L.T., , IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, Volume 17, Issue 8, Aug. 1998, pp. 645 - 654 and PVL use implicit moment matching, based on Krylov subspaces. These methods are slower than Elmore but more accurate. Compared to circuit simulation they are faster but less accurate. :*Circuit simulators such as SPICE may be used. This is usually the most accurate, but slowest, method. :*DCL, as defined above, can be used for interconnect as well as gate delay. Often, it makes sense to combine the calculation of a gate and all the wire connected to its output. This combination is often called the stage delay. The delay of a wire or gate may also depend on the behaviour of the nearby components. This is one of the main effects that is analyzed during signal integrity checks. Delay calculation in digital design In the context of semi-custom digital design, pre- characterized digital information is often abstracted in the form of the above mentioned 2-D look up table (LUT). The idea behind semi-custom design method is to use blocks of pre-built and tested components to build something larger, say, a chip. In this context, the blocks are logic gates such as NAND, OR, AND, etc. Although in reality these gates will be composed of transistors, a semi-custom engineer will only be aware of the delay information from input pin to output pin, called a timing arc. The 2D table represents information about the variability of the gate's delay with respect to the two independent variables, usually the rate of change of the signal at the input and the load at the output pin. These two variable are called slew and load in design parlance. A static timing analysis engine will first calculate the delay of the individual cells and string them together to do further analysis.  Statistical delay calculation  As chip dimensions get smaller, the delays of both gates and wires may need to be treated as statistical estimates instead of deterministic quantities. For gates, this requires extensions to the library formats. For wires, this requires methods that can calculate the means and distributions of wire delays. In both cases it is critical to capture the dependence on the underlying variables such a threshold voltage and metal thickness, since these result in correlations among the delays of nearby components. See Ying Liu; Pileggi, L.T.; Strojwas, A.J., (1999) , proceedings of the 36th Design Automation Conference, 21‚Äì25 June 1999, pp. 201 - 206 for an early example.

It was released direct-to-video on April 18, 2006. Principal photography was on location in Cape Town, South Africa.  Plot  CIA dirty deeds man John Dresham (Luke Goss) and Black Ops organiser Anthony Chapel (Roger Guenveur Smith) hire John Seeger (Steven Seagal) and his crew for a mission in the French-controlled Galmoral Island in Southern Africa. They tell them they are helping the locals when in reality they just want to get rich on oil and diamonds. John gets steamed when the mission goes wrong. Some of his soldiers take the French Ambassador (Rudiger Eberle) and his family hostage for leverage and later blow them all up. The French close in on them, his best friend Radio Jones (Zaa Nkweta) is killed, and Maxine Barnol, his spy posing as a journalist, suggests CIA involvement. John heads back to the US and goes to the home of Radio's wife Shondra (Faye Peters), tells her the news, and then promises her that he'll take care of her and her young son Eddie (Tumi Mogoje). While there he kills two of Dresham's men sent to kill him and discovers Dresham's implication. Chapel again hires the team of mercenaries, kidnapping Shondra and Eddie to force John into cooperating. The mission involves rescuing Kamal Dasan, the son of prominent gun runner Ahmet Dasan (Peter Butler), who has been arrested and thrown into the Randveld Prison outside of Cape Town, South Africa, and is due to be transferred to the States. Dresham discovers the job but not its object and when he bumps into Maxine he forces her to work for him instead of Chapel. Maxine leads him to believe that the target is the safe of the bank of South Africa and Dresham uses his CIA influence to be shown round the security installation. Maxine listens attentively and takes photos. John leads Dresham in circles but when the mercenaries break into the prison Kamal isn't there any more and the bad elements of the team get killed. Next stop the bank. In the safe John persuades the Greeks to arrest Kamal's father, then escapes making sure Dresham will be arrested too. Finally, with a few faithful members of his team, John rescues Shondra and Eddie and kills Chapel and his guards.

The director later said \\"the story was confusing because there were four writers on the film and things were left over from draft to draft. I pointed all this out but the producers but they did not care. Also the producers cut scene number 101 from the shooting schedule that played right in the middle of the film it caused a domino effect before and after. That scene was the tie up in the movie. I talked until I was blue in the face trying to convince them the decision was a huge mistake. They did not care.\\" Fauntleroy said scene 101 was where Maxine and Seeger meet up and set the plan in motion to expose Chapel and Dresham. \\"A fight sequence was to take place as Seeger left the Hotel where Seagal had to take on four guys so Maxine could slip away.\\" Fauntleroy claims the producers \\"just hated Steven and their whole existence was to destroy him, staff of personal, and the film.\\" Lawsuit Fauntleroy claimed the day he arrived on the film the producers \\"showed me a law suit that had already been prepared and was ready to file if Steven gave them any problems.\\" Nu Image, Inc., and Kill Master Productions sued Seagal for $14 million, claiming the actor caused production delays on the set of \\"Mercenary\\" and a second film, Today You Die by routinely arriving late on the set, rewriting the script and allowing members of his entourage to interfere with the work of crew members. The lawsuit was settled out of court.

It serves approximately 27,000 students in 41 schools and centers. The district is governed by the School Board of Alachua County, which is made up of five board members elected at large who serve staggered, four-year terms. In 2015, the district's average SAT score of 1620 was the highest in the state of Florida and above the national average. The districtwide passing rate on Advanced Placement exams was 63%, higher than state, national and global passing rates on the exams, which reflect college-level material. Five of the district's six traditional high schools were ranked on The Washington Post's 2015 High School Challenge Index, placing them among the top high schools in the nation. The district also received the What Parents Want Award from SchoolMatch, the nation's largest school selection consulting firm. About 16% of school districts nationwide receive the award each year. The district offers a number of magnet programs for gifted/talented students at the elementary, middle and high school levels. It also has thirteen career-tech high school magnet programs in fields such as healthcare, biotechnology, culinary arts and emergency services. There are approximately 4,000 employees of Alachua County Public Schools. About half of them are teachers. Each school has a nurse on campus full-time. School resource officers/deputies are also assigned to all schools.  History  The Alachua County Board of Public Instruction was established in 1869. Prior to that year there had been no publicly supported schools in the county. The Board of County Commissioners had provided for the payment of tuition to private schools for students whose families could not afford the tuition, but few families were willing to be seen as paupers and receive the aid. In 1866 the state-supported East Florida Seminary, which had been in Ocala until it closed early in the Civil War, was re-opened in Gainesville using the facilities of the private Gainesville Academy. The next year the Union Academy, a school for African-Americans sponsored by the Freedmen's Bureau, opened in Gainesville. By 1870 there were 22 schools in Alachua County, each with its own board of trustees. The schools were integrated, and therefore unpopular with most of the white population. Funding was low and the schools were poorly equipped and short of qualified teachers. The Compromise of 1877, which marked the end of Reconstruction, left the Alachua County school system under the control of white Democrats. A segregated public school system was established, with most of the available resources going to white schools. The change in control of the schools brought a cut in spending, and the school year for county supported schools, which had been five months long, was reduced to three months. The Union Academy, however, remained in session for six months a year, and then operated another two months as a normal school training African-American teachers. For a number of years public schools in Alachua County met in old houses or other rented spaces. The first building in the county erected specifically for use as a district school was in Gainesville in 1885. The Gainesville Graded and High School was built in 1900. With additions over the years, it has been known as Eastside Elementary and Kirby Smith Elementary. The building eventually became the administrative headquarters of the school district, designated the Kirby Smith Center, and since 2017, the Alachua County Public Schools District Office. The high school classes of the Gainesville Graded and High School moved to a new building, designated as Gainesville High School, in 1923. That same year the Lincoln School opened, replacing the Reconstruction-era Union Academy. Gainesville High School was moved to a new building in 1955. Gainesville High School was integrated in 1970 and Lincoln High School was closed, leaving Gainesville High School as the only high school in Gainesville. In northwestern Alachua County a school was opened in 1895 in the new community of Alachua. A new building for the school opened in 1901. Over the next few years schools in the neighboring communities of Newnansville, Haynsworth, Greenleaf, Hague, Gracy, Perseverance, Spring Hill, Santa Fe, Bland and LaCrosse were closed and the students moved to the Alachua school. In 1917 the high school classes were moved to a new building. In 1955 Alachua High School was combined with High Springs High School as Santa Fe High School.  Desegregation  Public schools in Alachua County were racially segregated from the end of Reconstruction in 1877. In response to the ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education, the Alachua County Public Schools Board was ordered by the courts to operate a freedom of choice system starting in 1964, when there were eleven all-black schools in the district. In 1969 there were still eight all-black and three all-white schools in the district. That year the U.S. Supreme Court decided, in Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, that public schools must be immediately fully desegregated. A district appeals court order established a biracial committee to advise the school board on a plan for desegregation. When the school board refused to forward the committee's recommended plan to the courts, the committee submitted it directly to the court, which ordered it to be implemented. Students were assigned to schools so that each school had a 70% white - 30% black ratio. Three elementary schools and Lincoln High School were closed. Schools The district has 48 schools including 31 elementary schools, 9 middle schools, 8 high schools, two special education centers (Sidney Lanier School and A. Quinn Jones Center), an early childhood center (Duval Early Learning Academy), a family services center (Fearnside Family Services Center) and an environmental education center (Camp Crystal Lake). The School Board of Alachua County also operates the virtual, online Alachua eSchool. Private, for-profit, and charter schools are not administered by the School Board of Alachua County, and are not included in these lists.

Finley was a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. Removal of Confederate monuments and memorials is motivated by the belief that the monuments glorify white supremacy and memorialize a treasonous government with founding principles based on the perpetuation and expansion of slavery. An opposing belief also exists, that monuments and memorials to Confederates are part of the cultural heritage of the southern United States of America. In August 2017, the School Board of Alachua County acknowledged the Finley legacy as potentially problematic, but declined to take action to rename the school. On June 16, 2020, the School Board of Alachua County (Florida) removed J.J. Finley's name from the school, during international protest associated with the murder of George Floyd. The School Board will convene a citizen committee to recommend a new name by August 2020.  Stephen Foster Elementary School  Stephen Foster is an American songwriter known primarily for parlor and minstrel music. Some modern interpretations of Foster's compositions consider the compositions to be disparaging to African Americans. Others, however, have argued that Foster unveiled the realities of slavery, while also imparting dignity to African Americans in his compositions, especially as he grew as an artist.  Sidney Lanier School  Sidney Lanier served in the Confederate States Army as a private, and was promoted by the United Daughters of the Confederacy as a poet of the Confederate States of America. As stated in a previous sub-section of this article, removal of Confederate monuments and memorials is motivated by the belief that the monuments glorify white supremacy and memorialize a treasonous government with founding principles based on the perpetuation and expansion of slavery.

He was born to William and Cecelia Deacon. After his mother married the non-juror bishop Jeremy Collier, the young Deacon was introduced to many of the leading Jacobite and non-juror figures including George Hickes. Though lacking a university education, Deacon became an accomplished scholar and was ordained by Jeremy Collier to the nonjuring priesthood in 1716. In addition to his theological studies, Deacon studied medicine with Richard Mead (1673‚Äì1754). He served several non-juror congregations in London before moving to Manchester around 1722, where he became a leading physician and married his wife Sarah (died 1745). Three of his twelve children served in the Jacobite rising of 1745. The oldest, Thomas Theodoras, served as captain of the Jacobite Manchester Regiment and was executed. His brother Robert Renatus died in prison and Charles Clement was exiled to Jamaica where he died in 1749. His daughter Sarah Sophia (1731‚Äì1801) married William Cartwright, an apothecary and later a Non-juring bishop in Deacon's church. During his years in Manchester, the city became a significant hub of Jacobite and Non-juror activity. Though he was clearly a Jacobite, he gave his primary attention to creating a continuing Non-juror church. He strongly espoused ecclesial independence from the state and opposed reunion with the Church of England. Joining him in his efforts were Collier, Thomas Brett and Roger Laurence, all of whom participated in the Usages Controversy that divided the Nonjuring community. The Usages party, freed from the oversight of the established church, advocated the reintroduction of four elements to the Eucharist -- the invocation of the Holy Spirit, the oblation, the mixed chalice, and the prayers for the dead. The first effort at creating such a liturgy was published in 1718, with the liturgy being drafted by Deacon and Brett. Many Non-jurors, even some who thought the usages acceptable, thought that this effort came at an inopportune time. Brett would later rejoin the main Non-Usages party in 1732, but his partner, Deacon, remained true to his belief that the Usages were a necessary part of the true and efficacious Eucharist. Scottish bishop Archibald Campbell would consecrate Deacon and Laurence as bishops of what now became the Orthodox British Church (1733). Deacon's interest in liturgics and spirituality are evidenced in his Compleat Collection of Devotions (1734). This book included a new liturgy, \\"The Order of the Divine Offices of the Orthodox British Church\\", which replaced the earlier one from 1718. In this liturgy Deacon added other ancient liturgical practices including infant communion. The book also included excerpts from John Wesley's \`Essay upon the Stationary Fasts'. Wesley met Deacon through John Clayton of Manchester who had been part of Wesley's Oxford group, which led to the invitation of the future Methodist founder to contribute to the book. Though never becoming an official Anglican liturgy, Deacon's incorporation of ancient Christian liturgies and reclaiming of the doctrine of eucharistic sacrifice would influence later liturgical developments. His most important work A Full, True, and Comprehensive View of Christianity (1747) included two catechisms, a detailed theological commentary on the Compleat Collection of Devotions, and the development of a sacramental theology that extended the number of sacraments to twelve. Among the offices added were confirmation, marriage, ordination, and infant communion. Deacon died on 16 February 1753 and was buried in the churchyard of Manchester's St. Ann's church. His graveslab still remains. References *Henry Broxap, The Biography of Thomas Deacon (1911) * Robert Cornwall, \\"Thomas Deacon\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, (2005) *Robert D.

The battle was fought on 19 April 1809 between the French III Corps led by Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout and the Austrian III Armeekorps commanded by Prince Friedrich Franz Xaver of Hohenzollern-Hechingen. The French won a hard- fought victory over their opponents when the Austrians withdrew that evening. The site of the battle is a wooded height approximately halfway between the villages of Teugn and Hausen in Lower Bavaria, part of modern-day Germany. Also on 19 April, clashes occurred at Arnhofen near Abensberg, D√ºnzling, Regensburg, and Pfaffenhofen an der Ilm. Together with the Battle of Teugen- Hausen, the fighting marked the first day of a four-day campaign which culminated in the French victory at the Battle of Eckm√ºhl. Austria's invasion of the Kingdom of Bavaria caught Emperor Napoleon I of France's Franco-German army by surprise. Though the advance of Archduke Charles' Austrian army was slow, mistakes by Napoleon's subordinate Marshal Louis-Alexandre Berthier placed Davout's corps in great peril. As Davout withdrew southwest from Regensburg on the south bank of the Danube, Charles tried to intercept the French with three powerful attacking columns. The first Austrian column missed the French altogether, while Davout's cavalry held off the second column. The third column crashed head-on into one of Davout's infantry divisions in a meeting engagement. Generals of both armies led their troops with courage and skill as the troops fought over two ridges. French reinforcements finally pushed the Austrians off the southern ridge late in the afternoon and Charles ordered a retreat that night. This opened a clear path for Davout to join the main body of the French army on 20 April. Background=Austrian plans On 8 February 1809, the Austrian Empire determined to make war on Napoleon. Led by Foreign Minister Johann Philipp Stadion, Count von Warthausen, the brilliant diplomat Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich, and Empress Maria Ludovika, the war party pointed to the 1808 French disaster at the Battle of Bail√©n in Spain. However, Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen, wished to put off the war in order to fully mobilize and find allies.Chandler, p. 663 Archduke Charles Archduke Charles, appointed generalissimo after the debacle of the War of the Third Coalition in 1805, had tried for three years to improve the Austrian army.Chandler, p. 664 Historian David G. Chandler wrote, \\"Charles was the very best man available to Austria\\" to lead her army.Chandler, p. 667 He expanded the number of regular soldiers to 340,000 and created a large body of 240,000 Landwehr troops. He upgraded the artillery corps, adopted the corps organization, and revised the infantry drillbook, incorporating more French- style tactical evolutions. Serious deficiencies remained, however, in Austrian staffwork, in the Landwehr organization, and among the non-German nationalities. At the start, only 15,000 of the best Landwehr formations were added to the field army while the rest were relegated to garrison duty or the reserves.Chandler, pp. 664‚Äì666 The Habsburgs did not wish to arm the population for fear of an insurrection and therefore the Landwehr was never fully utilized. In Hungary, the nobles and people were cool toward the war and contributed as little as possible.Arnold, p. 36 Archduke Charles and the Hofkriegsrat sent 50,000 in two corps to Italy under General der Kavallerie Archduke John and 40,000 more in one corps to Galicia under Feldmarschall- Leutnant Archduke Ferdinand Karl Joseph of Austria-Este. Charles massed the remaining regular army in Bohemia and along the Danube for the main effort.Chandler, p 673 Charles' 206,906-strong Hauptarmee (\\"main army\\") was organized into six army corps and two reserve corps. The I Armeekorps was led by General der Kavallerie Count Heinrich von Bellegarde and numbered 27,653 men. The II Armeekorps commanded by Feldzeugmeister Johann Kollowrat counted 28,168 soldiers. The III Armeekorps consisted of 29,360 troops under Feldmarschall-Leutnant Prince Friedrich Franz Xaver of Hohenzollern-Hechingen. The IV Armeekorps of Feldmarschall-Leutnant Prince Franz Seraph of Orsini- Rosenberg controlled 27,800 soldiers. The V Armeekorps was commanded by Feldmarschall-Leutnant Archduke Louis and numbered 32,266 men. The VI Armeekorps was made up of 35,693 troops under Feldmarschall-Leutnant Johann von Hiller. The I Reserve-Armeekorps was directed by General der Kavallerie Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein and counted 18,063 men. The II Reserve-Armeekorps was directed by Feldmarschall-Leutnant Michael von Kienmayer and controlled 7,975 soldiers.Bowden & Tarbox, pp. 65‚Äì73Arnold, p. 235. Arnold's strengths are used and are estimated in some cases. They do not include artillerists or sappers. Originally, Archduke Charles deployed six corps in Bohemia with only two corps south of the Danube. This proved to be too ambitious for the Austrian high command, so four corps were transferred south of the Danube. Accordingly, the I and II Armeekorps remained in Bohemia; the III, IV, and I Reserve-Armeekorps formed a central mass under Charles; and the V, VI, and II Reserve Armeekorps made up the southern flank guard.Chandler, pp. 676‚Äì677 Operations Louis Berthier excelled as Napoleon's chief of staff, but as army commander, he fumbled. On 9 April 1809, Archduke Charles gave notice to the French ambassador at Munich and Marshal Fran√ßois Joseph Lefebvre that Austria and France were at war. The next morning, Charles' army began crossing the Inn River in an invasion of the Kingdom of Bavaria. Only Lefebvre's VII Corps of three Bavarian divisions were available to oppose the Austrian onslaught. Fortunately for the Franco- Bavarians, it took six days for their enemies to reach the Isar River near Landshut.Chandler, p. 677 Napoleon did not expect the Austrians to declare war, but when it became obvious that war was imminent, he believed that hostilities would start after 15 April. From Paris, Napoleon ordered Marshal Louis-Alexandre Berthier to form the Grande Arm√©e d'Allemagne (Grand Army of Germany) from French and Allied units located on the Danube front. To Berthier he sent orders to concentrate at Regensburg if the Austrians invaded Bavaria after 15 April. If, however, his enemies attacked before the deadline, the army was to assemble farther west at Donauw√∂rth.Arnold, p. 59 By misfortune, an order that Napoleon sent on 10 April did not arrive until the 16th. A second order, elaborating on the first order, arrived late on the 13th. Berthier was an excellent chief of staff to Napoleon, but as an army commander he was out of his element. In the confusion, he misinterpreted the out-of- sequence instructions and ordered a forward concentration at Regensburg.Chandler, pp. 678‚Äì679 Berthier commanded Davout, who had been sensibly concentrating rearward, to collect his corps at Regensburg on the left wing. Meanwhile, the right wing of the Grande Arm√©e was distant, with only a thin line of Bavarians holding the center. On the right wing, General Nicolas Oudinot's II Corps was ordered to move toward Regensburg, while Marshal Andr√© Mass√©na's IV Corps was directed to move from Ulm to Augsburg. On 16 April, the Austrians forced a crossing over the Isar at Landshut. Early the next morning, Napoleon reached the front to take over from his harried subordinate Berthier. He quickly ordered a new concentration near Ingolstadt. To this end, the emperor recalled Davout's III Corps from Regensburg on the south bank of the Danube. Lefebvre's Bavarians must hold the center until Davout got away.Chandler, pp. 679‚Äì681 It was not until 18 April that Napoleon realized that 80,000 Austrians menaced Davout. He decided to send Mass√©na toward Landshut to threaten Archduke Charles' rear in an attempt to take the pressure off Davout. Meanwhile, the emperor instructed Oudinot to support Lefebvre, and directed G√©n√©ral de Division Dominique Vandamme's small W√ºrttemberg corps to march east from Ingolstadt. For his part, Archduke Charles was aware that he had a chance to destroy Davout's corps.Chandler, pp. 682‚Äì683 Order of battle=French forces Marshal Louis Davout * III Corps: Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout (34,672, 47 guns)Bowden & Tarbox, pp. 58‚Äì59 ** Corps Artillery Reserve: G√©n√©ral de Division Antoine Hanicque (359) *** (2) 12 pdr foot batteries (12 guns) ** 2nd Division: G√©n√©ral de Division Louis Friant (11,440) *** Brigade: G√©n√©ral de Brigade Jacques Gilly **** 10th Light Infantry Regiment **** 33rd Line Infantry Regiment *** Brigade: G√©n√©ral de Brigade Louis Grandeau **** 108th Line Infantry Regiment *** Brigade: G√©n√©ral de Brigade Claude Hervo **** 111st Line Infantry Regiment *** Brigade: G√©n√©ral de Brigade Joseph Barban√®gre **** 48th Line Infantry Regiment *** Divisional Artillery: 8 pdr foot battery (8 guns) ** 4th Division: G√©n√©ral de Division Louis Vincent Le Blond de Saint-Hilaire (11,330) *** Brigade: G√©n√©ral de Brigade Guillaume Latrille de Lorencez **** 10th Light Infantry Regiment **** 3rd Line Infantry Regiment **** 57th Line Infantry Regiment *** Brigade: G√©n√©ral de Brigade Jean-Marie Destabenrath **** 72nd Line Infantry Regiment **** 105th Line Infantry Regiment *** Divisional Artillery: 8 pdr foot battery (8 guns), 6 pdr horse battery (7 guns) ** 3rd Division: G√©n√©ral de Division Charles-√âtienne Gudin de La Sablonni√®re (11,543) *** Brigade: G√©n√©ral de Brigade Claude Petit **** 7th Light Infantry Regiment *** Brigade: G√©n√©ral de Brigade Pierre Boyer **** 12th Line Infantry Regiment **** 21st Line Infantry Regiment *** Brigade: G√©n√©ral de Brigade Jean Duppelin **** 25th Line Infantry Regiment **** 85th Line Infantry Regiment *** Divisional Artillery: 8 pdr foot battery (6 guns), 4 pdr horse battery (6 guns) Austrian forces Prince Friedrich of Hohenzollern-Hechingen led the Austrian III Armeekorps at Teugen- Hausen. * III Armeekorps: Feldmarschall-Leutnant Friedrich Franz Xaver Prince of Hohenzollern-HechingenBowden & Tarbox, pp. 67‚Äì68 (18,000) ** Artillery reserve: Oberst Johann Smola *** 6 pdr position battery (6 guns) *** (3) 12 pdr position batteries (18 guns) ** Light division: Feldmarschall-Leutnant Josef Philipp Vukassovich *** Brigade: General-Major Moritz Liechentstein **** Erzherzog Karl Legion (1st and 3rd bns) **** Erzherzog Ferdinand Hussar Regiment No. 3 (8 sqns) **** 3 pdr brigade battery (8 guns) *** Brigade: General-Major Josef Pfanzelter (detached) **** Peterwardeiner Grenz Infantry Regiment No. 9 (2 bns) (one bn detached) **** Hessen-Homburg Hussar Regiment No. 4 (8 sqns) (two sqns detached) **** 3 pdr Grenz brigade battery (8 guns) *** Divisional artillery: 6 pdr Cavalry Battery (6 guns) ** Division: Feldmarschall-Leutnant Franz Joseph, Marquis de Lusignan *** Brigade: General- Major Nikolaus Kayser **** Schr√∂der Infantry Regiment No. 7 (3 bns) **** Wenzel Colloredo Infantry Regiment No. 56 (3 bns) **** 6 pdr brigade battery (8 guns) *** Brigade: General-Major Ludwig Thierry (detached) **** Kaiser Infantry Regiment No. 1 (3 bns) (detached) **** Lindenau Infantry Regiment No. 29 (3 bns) (detached) **** 6 pdr brigade battery (8 guns) (detached) *** Divisional artillery: 6 pdr position battery (6 guns) ** Division: Feldmarschall-Leutnant Franz Xaver Saint-Julien *** Brigade: General-Major Alois Liechentstein **** Manfredini Infantry Regiment No. 12 (3 bns) **** W√ºrzburg Infantry Regiment No. 23 (3 bns) **** 6 pdr brigade battery (8 guns) *** Brigade: General-Major Josef Bieber **** Kaunitz Infantry Regiment No. 20 (3 bns) **** W√ºrttemberg Infantry Regiment No. 38 (3 bns) **** 6 pdr brigade battery (8 guns) *** Divisional artillery: 6 pdr position battery (6 guns) Key * bn, bns = infantry battalion(s) * sqns = cavalry squadrons * pdr = pounder, where 3, 4, 6, 8, or 12 represents the weight of the cannonball in pounds Battle=Deployments Archduke Charles hoped that 19 April would bring a great success. His orders for that morning were for the center of his army to attack Davout in an effort to trap the French III Corps against the Danube.Arnold, pp. 78‚Äì79 By a stroke of luck Charles obtained a copy of Davout's marching orders for the 19th. By 5:00 AM, the Austrian commander issued the marching orders for the day from his headquarters in Rohr in Niederbayern.Petre, pp. 108‚Äì109 Charles directed three major columns to intercept the French. He sent the right and center columns northeast toward Langquaid. From there, the right column would pass near Eckm√ºhl (Eggm√ºhl) and turn north for Regensburg where it would rendezvous with General-Major Peter von V√©csey's II Armeekorps brigade. The center column would guide left in the direction of D√ºnzling. Charles instructed the left column to march via Bachel, Hausen, Teugn, and Bad Abbach.Petre, p. 109 Battle of Teugen-Hausen, showing the attempt by Archduke Charles to cut off Marshal Davout On the right marched the Prince of Liechtenstein with the three heavy cavalry brigades of his I Reserve-Armeekorps. Attached to this command was General-Major Andreas Schneller's II Reserve-Armeekorps cuirassier brigadeArnold, p. 83 and Feldmarschall-Leutnant Karl Friedrich von Lindenau's V Armeekorps infantry division.Arnold, p. 74 map In the center, Feldmarschall-Leutnant Prince Franz Seraph of Rosenberg-Orsini led the IV Armeekorps, followed by General-Major Prince Victor Rohan's division-sized 13,904-man grenadier brigade belonging to the I Reserve-Armeekorps.Arnold, p. 235 On the left, Hohenzollern advanced with his III Armeekorps, minus two detachments of about 7,000 troops.Arnold, pp. 83‚Äì84 Altogether, the Archduke committed 65,000 soldiers to destroy the French III Corps. Liechtenstein's right column moved north on the main road to Regensburg. Rosenberg advanced toward the hamlet of D√ºnzling, while Hohenzollern's proposed route went through the villages of Haugen and Saal an der Donau. At Saal, the Feking stream emptied into the Danube, creating a potential bottleneck. If the Austrians held the Saal defile, Davout's escape route would be cut off. North of the Danube, Bellegarde's I Armeekorps was still distant. Kollowrat's II Armeekorps assembled on the Danube's north bank, opposite Regensburg, which was defended by a small French garrison. South of III Armeekorps, Archduke Louis' V Armeekorps, minus Lindenau's division, had orders to contain Marshal Fran√ßois Joseph Lefebvre's Bavarian VII Corps near Abensberg. Kienmayer's II Reserve-Armeekorps, minus its cuirassier brigade, remained at Pfeffenhausen in support of Louis. Hiller's VI Armeekorps was on the extreme left wing.Arnold, p. 79 Hiller posted Major Scheibler and 1,200 troops at Pfaffenhofen an der Ilm to look out for Mass√©na's forces.Arnold, p. 98 At the beginning of the war, Feldmarschall-Leutnant Franz Jellacic's division was detached from Hiller in order to capture Munich and provide a link between Bavaria and the Tyrol. Hiller ordered Jellacic to rejoin him on 18 April, but the latter never arrived because Charles ordered him back to Munich.Arnold, p. 78 Jellacic's luckless command would continue its wanderings until being smashed at the Battle of Sankt Michael on 25 May.Schneid, pp. 86‚Äì87 Archduke Charles ordered Hohenzollern to detach troops in order to provide a link between the III and V Armeekorps. Hohenzollern obeyed, sending General-Major Ludwig Thierry's brigade on this assignment, then he erred in sending a second 1,000-man detachment under General-Major Josef Pfanzelter to link III Armeekorps and Thierry. After the two detachments, only 18,000 troops remained to carry out the III Armeekorps main mission. Davout sent the III Corps trains along the river road from Regensburg to Abensberg. Friant's 2nd Division, La Sablonni√®re's 3rd Division, and G√©n√©ral de Division Raymond- Gaspard de Bonardi de Saint-Sulpice's 2nd Heavy Cavalry Division protected the wagon train. Flank protection was provided by G√©n√©ral de Division Charles Antoine Morand's 1st Division, Saint-Hilaire's 4th Division, and G√©n√©ral de Division Louis-Pierre Montbrun's Light Cavalry Division. The corps commander also directed one battalion to make a night march in order to secure the all- important Saal defile. Regensburg was defended by Colonel Louis Coutard's 2,000-strong 65th Line Infantry Regiment.Arnold, p. 100 D√ºnzling, Arnhofen, and other clashes Johann Liechtenstein Johann Liechtenstein's blow on the right flank hit only air, as no French troops stood between him and Regensburg. Near D√ºnzling and Schneidert, Rosenberg bumped into Montbrun's cavalry, reinforced by two infantry battalions. With less than 4,000 troops, Montbrun conducted a brilliant delaying action against IV Armeekorps all day, using the wooded terrain to good advantage.Arnold, p. 90 Rosenberg's corps was weakened early in the campaign by the detachment of Feldmarschall-Leutnant Joseph von Dedovich's division to besiege Passau.Epstein, p. 58 On 19 April Rosenberg marshaled 16 infantry battalions and 15 cavalry squadrons.Petre, p. 110 At 9:00 am near Schneidert, three kilometers east of Haugen, General-Major Karl Wilhelm von Stutterheim's IV Armeekorps advance guard brigade brushed against the 12th and 21st Line Infantry of Gudin's division as they marched west. Continuing to the northeast, Rosenberg began to \\"fritter away\\" forces to guard his flanks and rear. He left one battalion and one squadron with the grenadiers, one battalion and four squadrons to hold Schneidert, five battalions to guard his line of march, and one battalion to hold a hill at Moosholzen.Petre, p. 111 After holding the Austrians near Moosholzen and D√ºnzling until evening, Montbrun fell back northwest to Peising near Abbach.Petre, pp. 111‚Äì112 Montbrun reported 233 total casualties while inflicting much heavier losses on his opponents. The Austrians lost 116 killed, 452 wounded, 357 captured, and 159 missing for a total of 1,084.Smith, p. 289 As the link between Archduke Louis and Hohenzollern, Thierry had his reinforced brigade on the road at 6:00 am. When he reached high ground near Abensberg, he saw Bavarian troops massing nearby and soon became embroiled in a skirmish with them near the village of Arnhofen, northeast of Abensberg. In this contest, the Bavarian light cavalry mauled Thierry's four squadrons of attached dragoons.Arnold, pp. 93‚Äì94 Elements of Crown Prince Louis' 1st Bavarian Division and General Karl Philipp von Wrede's 2nd Bavarian Division were involved. The Bavarians admitted 13 killed, 201 wounded, and 13 captured out of 7,600 troops engaged, while claiming to have captured one cannon and 400 Austrian prisoners. Thierry withdrew his brigade southeast to Offenstetten. At Regensburg, the 65th Regiment evacuated the fortified bridgehead on the north bank of the Danube and withdrew into the suburb of Stadt-am-Hof. Under an artillery barrage, Kollowrat launched an assault against the town which burst through a gate and into the streets. However, the French defenders ambushed the Austrian column and drove it out of the suburb. After an all-day fight, the French held Stadt-am-Hof and Regensberg, but ran dangerously low on small-arms ammunition. Coutard begged Davout for a resupply but it would never arrive.Arnold, pp. 101‚Äì102 A hastily organized convoy was captured by Austrian cavalry the following morning.Arnold, pp. 119‚Äì120 Far to the southwest at Pfaffenhofen an der Ilm, General Nicolas Oudinot fell on Scheibler's isolated VI Armeekorps detachment with the leading formations of his II Corps. Attacking with an infantry division and Pierre Colbert's cavalry brigade, the French routed the Austrians and took 200 prisoners. Teugn and Hausen Sometime after 9:00 am, Saint-Hilaire's advance elements blundered into the III Armeekorps marching column at Hausen. Feldmarschall-Leutnant Vukassovich quickly deployed two battalions of light infantry, the Peterwardeiner Grenz and the Archduke Charles Legion, and flushed the French from the village, chasing them north. By the time the French commanders reacted, Vukassovich installed Moritz Liechtenstein's brigade on a wooded ridge approximately halfway between Hausen and Teugn. (Half of Pfanzelter's brigade of Vukassovich was detached.)Arnold, p. 85 He was joined there by Feldmarschall-Leutnant Lusignan and the brigade of General-Major Nikolaus Kayser. (Lusignan's other brigade, Thierry's was detached to the left.)Arnold, p. 250 French grenadier (left) and voltigeur (right) of a line infantry regiment To gain time for Saint-Hilaire's division to deploy out of marching column, Davout hurled the 2,000 troops of the 3rd Line Infantry Regiment at Vukassovich and Lusignan's 6,000 soldiers and 12 cannon. The entire 3rd Line deployed into skirmish formation and swarmed uphill. Its attack failed to dislodge the Austrians, but it allowed time for the 57th Line Infantry Regiment (called \\"the Terrible\\") to organize a second assault. The 57th Line's charge carried the first ridge, but stalled before a second ridge. In the teeth of intense musketry and cannon fire, the highly trained French infantry deployed into line and returned fire. By this time the 3rd Line had reformed behind the 57th and took position on its right. Farther to the right, the 10th Light Infantry surged forward against the Austrian left flank where they forced an Austrian battery to retire to the rear. The new attack faltered and fell back to the first ridge when it ran into a strong position on the second ridge.Arnold, pp. 86‚Äì87 By this time both sides had received reinforcements. On the French side, the last two units of Saint-Hilaire's division, the 72nd and 105th Line Infantry Regiments deployed near Teugn.Arnold, p. 88 For the Austrians, General-Major Alois Liechtenstein brought up the first brigade of Feldmarschall-Leutnant Franz Xaver Saint-Julien's division. Hohenzollern launched a frontal attack on the 57th Line. At the same time he sent half of Alois Liechtenstein's brigade through the woods to envelop the French left flank. Davout's chief of staff, G√©n√©ral de Division Jean Dominique Compans, alertly sent the 72nd Line to stop the flanking move. The French caught the Austrians just as they began to deploy from column into line and hustled them back into the trees.Arnold, p. 89 Lusignan, Saint-Julien, and Alois Liechtenstein called for another effort. One of Vukassovich's hussar regiments swept out of the woods, heading for the 57th Line's flank. The left battalion of the 57th formed square and drove off the horsemen. With their generals displaying front-line leadership, the Austrian attack roared out of the woods and fell on the French troops lining the first ridge. The push collapsed in the face of converging musketry from the defenders' concave line and a thrust against its left flank by the 3rd Line. Alois Liechtenstein bravely led the W√ºrzburg Infantry Regiment No. 23 in another charge, this time against one French flank. This thrust finally succeeded in shoving the French off the first ridge, though Liechtenstein fell badly wounded. A lull ensued in which Davout personally rallied Saint-Hilaire's exhausted survivors.Arnold, pp. 90‚Äì91 Davout's artillery arrived about 3:00 pm, having been delayed by a staff blunder. Backed by artillery support for the first time, the tired French infantry retook the first ridge. An artillery colonel scouted the woods on the Austrian right flank and found a promising position to post his guns. When he reported his discovery to Saint-Hilaire, the two improvised a new attack. Saint-Hilaire waved his men forward in a new frontal attack while a horse artillery battery slipped into position unnoticed by the Austrians.Arnold, p. 91 The advance guard of Friant's division soon appeared, aiming for the Austrian right flank. Suddenly, the French unmasked their hidden battery, opening a destructive enfilade fire. The shocked Austrians rapidly lost ground. About this time, the last of Saint-Julien's brigades under General- Major Josef Bieber put in an appearance. A counterattack by one of Bieber's regiments halted the French pursuit, though Moritz Liechtenstein was wounded. At 5:00 pm a violent thunderstorm swept across the area, ending the battle.Arnold, pp. 91‚Äì92 Results According to historian James R. Arnold, the Austrians admitted 527 killed, 2,470 wounded, and 466 captured, for a total of 3,463. The French reported 2,345 casualties, mostly in Saint- Hilaire's division.Arnold, p. 93 Digby Smith puts Austrian casualties at 3,862 and French losses at about 4,000. Francis Loraine Petre gives Austrian casualties as 3,846 and French losses as 4,376. The latter total includes French losses at D√ºnzling.Petre, p. 118 Austrian general officers suffered unusually heavy losses, attesting to \\"front-line leadership that heretofore had been rare.\\" The brothers Alois and Moritz Liechtenstein, Bieber, and Lusignan were all wounded. Lusignan sustained a dangerous head wound which forced his permanent retirement from military service.Smith-Kudrna, Lusignan, Franz Joseph Marquis After receiving an unfavorable report of the battle from Hohenzollern, Archduke Charles ordered him to retreat. This act conceded the victory to Davout, since this gave the French Marshal a clear line of communication with his Bavarian allies. At 10 pm on the 19th, Lefebvre sent the important information to Napoleon that he could see Davout's campfires near Teugn. To the Emperor, this meant that the III Corps had escaped entrapment.Arnold, p. 95 The Battle of Abensberg was fought the next day.Smith, p. 290 Historical note Napoleon's name for the battle of the 19th was \\"Thann\\". Francis Loraine Petre remarked, \\"The 'battle of Hausen- Teugen' would have been more appropriate.\\"Petre, p. 112 Herrnwahlthann or ThannPetre, p. 114 is two kilometers southwest of Haugen.The distance and direction can be discerned by using Google Earth.

The Keokuk‚ÄìHamilton Bridge was built in 1985, taking over automobile traffic from the Keokuk Rail Bridge (though the latter bridge still carries rail traffic). During the Great Flood of 1993, the rising Mississippi temporarily made the Keokuk‚ÄìHamilton Bridge inaccessible from the Illinois side of the river; later, gravel was layered over the threatened section of U.S. 136 to raise its level and keep the road and bridge accessible for the remaining flood period. More recently, during the 2008 Midwest floods, the Illinois access was again threatened, but this time gravel was applied and the road level raised before it was rendered completely impassable; only temporary closings were required to allow road workers to complete the job. IDOT,(Illinois Department of Transportation), and WL Miller Co., a large concrete, quarry and asphalt company, put over 26,000 tons of rock on the eastbound lanes. The bridge approach was lifted about 4‚Äì6 feet in some areas. During the cleanup, some of the fairly new road was damaged, and IDOT is considering repaving the eastbound lanes from the bridge to Pats Pit Stop.

It was the largest U.S. airborne operation since Operation Varsity in March 1945, the largest airborne operation of the Vietnam War, and one of the largest U.S. operations of the war.Retrieved 9 November 2010. The operation was named after Junction City, Kansas, home of the operation's commanding officer. Background The stated aim of the almost three-month engagement involving the equivalent of nearly three divisions of U.S. troops was to locate the elusive 'headquarters' of the Communist uprising in South Vietnam, the Central Office of South Vietnam (COSVN). By some accounts of U.S. analysts at the time, such a headquarters was believed to be almost a \\"mini-Pentagon\\", complete with typists, file cabinets, and staff workers possibly guarded by layers of bureaucracy. In truth, after the end of the war, the actual headquarters was revealed by Viet Cong (VC) archives to be a small and mobile group of people, often sheltering in ad hoc facilities and at one point escaping an errant bombing by some hundreds of meters. Junction City's grand tactical plan was a \\"hammer and anvil\\" tactic, whereupon airborne forces would \\"flush out\\" the VC headquarters, sending them to retreat against a prepared \\"anvil\\" of other forces. The U.S. forces included most of the 1st Infantry Division and the 25th Infantry Division including the 196th Light Infantry Brigade, the airborne troops of the 173rd Airborne Brigade and large armored elements of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (11th ACR). Operation II Field Force, Vietnam started the operation on 22 February 1967 (while Operation Cedar Falls was winding down). The initial operation was carried out by the 1st (commanded by Major General William E. DePuy) and the 25th (commanded by Major General Frederick C. Weyand) infantry divisions, who led their forces to the north of the operational area to build the \\"anvil\\" on which the VC 9th Division would be crushed. At the same time as the movement of infantry (eight battalions with 249 helicopters) along with 845 paratroopers conducted the only mass jump of the Vietnam War and the largest since Operation Tomahawk of the Korean War. The 2nd Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment of the 173d Airborne Brigade, went into action west of the deployment of the 1st and the 25th Infantry Divisions. At first the operations appeared to be succeeding, objectives were reached without encountering great resistance and on February 23, the mechanized forces 11th ACR and the 2nd Brigade, 25th Infantry Division, the \\"hammer\\" of armor struck against the '\\"anvil\\" of the infantry and airborne positioned north and west, giving the VC forces seemingly no chance to escape. The PAVN claim that on the first day of the operation they killed almost 200 U.S. troops, destroyed 16 armored vehicles and shot down 16 aircraft. The VC, highly mobile and elusive, with information sources deep in the South Vietnamese bureaucracy, had already moved their headquarters to Cambodia and launched several attacks to inflict losses and wear down the Americans. On February 28 and March 10 there were engagements with U.S. forces at the Battle of Prek Klok I and the Battle of Prek Klok II where the US, supported by powerful air strikes and massive artillery support repulsed VC attacks but the strategic result was disappointing. On 18 March 1967, General Bruce Palmer Jr., new commander of II Field Force, Vietnam, after General Seaman, launched the second phase of Junction City, this time directly to the east by the mechanized divisions, the 1st Infantry Division and 11th ACR, reinforced this time from the 1st Brigade of the 9th Infantry Division. This maneuver gave rise to the toughest battle of the operation, the March 19 Battle of Ap Bau Bang II, where the VC 273rd Regiment put into difficulties the American armored cavalry, before being forced to retire by a huge amount of firepower. The VC launched two more attacks in force, on March 21 and in Ap Gu on April 1, against the 1st and the 25th Infantry Division, both assaults were bloodily repulsed and the VC 9th Division came out seriously weakened, though still able to fight or retreat to safety in areas adjacent to the Cambodian border. On April 16 the U.S. command of II Field Force, in agreement with the MACV, decided to continue operations with a third phase of Operation Junction City. Until May 14 certain units of the 25th Infantry Division, undertook long and exhausting searches, advancing in the bush, raking villages and retrieving large amounts of materiel but with little contact with the Communist units, now cautiously moved to a defensive footing. Aftermath The US infantry enjoyed advantages in mechanization over the Viet Cong forces encountered, including the M113 and in certain locales, full battle tanks Air drop of supplies in Operation Junction City Tay Ninh Province was picked over thoroughly and VC forces suffered significant losses, including large amounts of material captured: 810 tonnes of rice, 600 tonnes of small arms, 500,000 pages of documents. The American losses were not negligible, however, amounting to nearly 300 dead and over 1,500 injured. According to calculations by the American command, the VC 9th Division was seriously weakened by the operations, suffering the loss of 2,728 killed, 34 captured men and 139 deserters. 100 crew-served weapons and 491 individual weapons were captured. After the operations, the American forces were recalled to other areas of operation, and the country which was supposed to be in the firm control of the South Vietnamese government soon fell prey again to infiltration by the VC forces when they returned from their sanctuaries in Cambodia. Allied intelligence later learned that as a result of the operation the VC moved most of their main force units across the border into Cambodia rather than stationing them in South Vietnam where they were more vulnerable to attack. The border sanctuaries in Cambodia which had previously been logistical areas were now expanded dramatically creating further tension between Cambodia and South Vietnam and its Allies. When American troops found in some stores 120 reels of film and logistical equipment for the printing of documents, the command of MACV believed they had finally found the famous COSVN. However, the reality was very different. The mobile headquarters, commanded by some mysterious and famous personalities such as generals Thanh, Tran Van Tran and Do, had quickly retreated to Cambodia, maintaining its operations and confounding the hopes of the U.S. strategic planners. With a huge consumption of resources and equipment, including 366,000 rounds of artillery and 3,235 tons of bombs, the American forces had inflicted losses on the communist forces and demonstrated the ability of airborne forces and even mechanized forces (also useful in impervious territory). Despite the tactical results, Junction City on an operational level had missed the most important objective as well as a failure to yield long term strategic leverage.

They are skin- colored or yellowish firm, rounded bumps, 1‚Äì3 mm in diameter, and may be confused with xanthoma, milia, hidrocystoma, trichoepithelioma, and xanthelasma. They are more common in women and are most commonly found in middle-aged Asian women. While they can present at any time in life, they typically present during adolescence. They are usually not associated with any other symptoms although can sometimes cause itchiness or irritation.  Types * Eruptive this form typically presents on the anterior chest, abdomen, neck and arms. It presents in successive crops with periods of relief in between times of active rash. * Milia-like this type of syringoma is typically smaller lesions that have a milky white center that can look like milia. * Plaque type this type is more commonly associated with itchiness and chronic scratching that leads to epidermal thickening similar to lichen planus. * Familial some cases of syringoma exhibit a familial pattern in an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Chromosome 16q22 has been shown to be involved in the genetic links of syringoma. Presentation= Associated syndromes  Syringomas can be found in association with other symptoms as part of a syndrome. Hailey‚ÄìHailey disease (also known as familial benign chronic pemphigus) is a blistering disease that can also include syringomas. Several systemic syndromes have also been associated with syringoma including diabetes mellitus, Down syndrome, Brooke-Spiegler and Nicolau-Balus. Specifically, diabetes mellitus is strongly associated with clear cell syringoma consisting of nests of clear cells containing glycogen. It is thought that phosphorylase deficiency, resulting from elevated glucose levels seen in diabetes leads to an accumulation of glycogen in the skin and within the clear cells. The incidence of syringomas has been reported in up to 40 percent of people with Down syndrome and can be associated with a condition calcinosis cutis which requires prompt medical attention. Brooke-Spiegler syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome with cutaneous manifestations including syringomas and trichoepitheliomas. Nicolau-Balus syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder consisting of atrophoderma vermiculata and syringomas.  Pathophysiology  Syringoma (eccrine) The pathophysiology of syringomas remains largely unknown. Familial patterns presenting in an autosomal dominant pattern suggest a genetic link that can result in varying genetic aberrations in lesions, specifically chromosome 16q22. The most commonly accepted theory is that syringomas are benign growths that arise from the intraepidermal portion of eccrine ducts. Another theory suggests that syringomas are a reactive hyperplasia rather than a true neoplasm resulting after inflammatory processes such as eczema. It has also been suggested that a hamartomatous process could explain eruptive syringomas. A hamartoma of pluripotent stem cells could precede the pathological process. Syringomas may also be under hormonal influence explaining the female predominance.  Diagnosis  Syringomas can often be diagnosed clinically based on presentation, distribution patterns over the body, lack of associated symptoms and family history. A definitive diagnosis requires a skin biopsy to allow the tissue to be examined under a microscope. Histologically, syringomas have a characteristic comma- (\\"tadpole\\") shaped tail of dilated, cystic eccrine ducts.  Treatment  The goal of treatment is to improve the appearance of lesions since they are otherwise not serious and typically do not cause symptoms. Many treatment methods have been attempted however, complete removal is uncommon. No single treatment method has been shown to consistently work. Both medical and surgical treatments have been studied, each with variable success. Common destructive treatment methods include carbon dioxide lasers, dermabrasion, surgical excision, electrocoagulation and chemical peels. Many of these methods are very time-consuming and require multiple treatment sessions. Carbon dioxide lasers are the most commonly practiced method; however, can cause thermal damage leading to scarring in the area. Medical therapies include topical atropine, topical retinoids and oral tranilast. The most common adverse effects include redness, skin discoloration and pain. Other side effects include blistering and scarring.

Third generation The 3rd generation Pier at Edinburgh Place, 2005. Third Generation (1957) near Edinburgh Place, decommissioned 11 November 2006. The pier was created in the late 1950s following a major land reclamation in Central. The pier was built in 1957 in the Streamline Moderne style at the height of the Modern Movement near the City Hall complex, which was being planned at the time. Its completion was concurrent with the completion of the still standing Tsim Sha Tsui Ferry Pier, which was built on the Kowloon side. The Star Ferry Pier was designed by a local Chinese architect, Hung Yip Chan (born in 1921). He worked at the Architectural Office (AO) of the Hong Kong Government from 1952 to 1957 as an assistant architect. He designed the facade of the pier, and the Chief Architect Michael Wright added the Clock Tower to make the pier more balanced and practical. Fourth generation 4th generation Star Ferry Pier in 2009, with Pier 8 on the left and Pier 7 on the right. Pier 8 was converted into a museum in 2013. Fourth Generation (2006) ‚Äì also known as \\"Central Ferry Piers 7 and 8\\" at Man Kwong Street. Central Piers 7 and 8 were built to replace the Edinburgh Place Ferry Pier in Central, on Hong Kong Island, pursuant of the Central and Wan Chai Reclamation projects. The building design resembles the second generation pier. The pier was moved further into Victoria Harbour, and constructed on reclaimed land approximately 300 metres away from the former site (as the crow flies). The new pier is located directly northwards, in front of the old pier. Part of the new pier was built at the time of the reclamation for the Hong Kong Station of the Airport Express MTR line and the International Finance Centre. It thus derives its name from having been Pier No.7 of the outlying islands ferry piers. Pier 8 was subsequently converted and is currently housing the Hong Kong Maritime Museum since February 2013. As a consequence, Pier 7 remains the only one serving the Star Ferry in Central. Design The northern fa√ßade of the fourth-generation Star Ferry Pier (harbour side). As these structures occupy a prime waterfront site, the Government had attempted to develop the piers into a new landmark for public enjoyment. The Star Ferry proposed a historical heritage design approach and this pier was expanded eastwards to resemble a replica of the second generation Edwardian pier. The present mock-Edwardian pier, being a 600-square-metre terminal, features a clock tower with a new set of five electronically controlled bells that sound similar to those of the former Edinburgh Place Ferry Pier. Other design features of the building include open-air pier, natural lighting, including skylights. The bottom two floors of each of the two \\"finger piers\\" will serve as boarding and waiting rooms, while the top floors will feature a public viewing deck, a canteen- style restaurant and a caf√©. The Star Ferry Company has also applied to set up a bar in one area of the top floor. To get to the public viewing corridor, visitors should pass through the passage to the Waterfront restaurant and turn right. Design controversy The Government's attempt at Edwardian architecture drew some criticism from the public in both the design and materials used, and the structure has been criticised as \\"an imitation of the past without capturing the spirit of the past or present\\". It has been derided amongst others as \\"theme park\\" in appearance.Ng Tze-wei, \\"Not even HK's storied Star Ferry can face down developers, 10 November 2006, International Herald Tribune See also *Wan Chai Pier *Tourism in Hong Kong ReferencesExternal links *Star Ferry official site Category:Central, Hong Kong Category:Piers in Hong Kong Category:Star Ferry Category:Streamline Moderne architecture in Hong Kong Category:Victoria Harbour Category:Water transport in Hong Kong ","title":"Star Ferry Pier, Central"},{"id":"3768496","text":"Kynance Cove (, meaning ravine cove) is a cove on the eastern side of Mount's Bay, Cornwall, England. It is situated on the Lizard peninsula approximately two miles (3 km) north of Lizard Point.Ordnance Survey,Explorer Map 103, The Lizard, Falmouth and Helston. The cove became popular in the early Victorian era, with many distinguished visitors including Queen Victoria and Prince AlbertPenzance: The Biography, Mike Sagar-Fenton, page 158 and the poet Alfred Tennyson.Objective One webpage: Kynance visits by Alfred Tennyson. The BBC has described Kynance Cove as \\"one of the most beautiful stretches of coastline in the South West\\".BBC sevenwonders south-west-cornwall The South West Coast Path, which follows the coast of south west England from Somerset to Dorset passes by on the cliffs overlooking the cove. Kynance Cove and the surrounding coast are owned and managed by the National Trust. It is part of the West Lizard Site of Special Scientific Interest and is in the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The Kynance Caf√©, which opened for business in 1929, relied on spring water and on a generator for power. When the caf√© became the property of the National Trust in 1999, the Trust renovated it and provided mains water and electricity. Access is via the South-west coastal footpath from the nearby National Trust car park. Geography and geology Much of the Lizard peninsula is known for its botany and geology, and about 375 million years ago the molten rock, which eventually became the Lizard, was about 10 km below the surface of the earth and under immense heat and pressure. One of the rocks (peridotite) is rich in magnesium and iron, and changed through heat and pressure to serpentinite as it pushed upwards from the Moho, the boundary of the earth's crust and mantle. It finally reached the crust's surface, about 30¬∞ south of the equator as part of an ocean ridge, in the Rheic Ocean. Over the next 80 million years the Rheic Ocean disappeared and the mass of rock headed north crossing the equator about 250 million years ago. The rock mass, which became the Lizard peninsula, passed the Tropic of Cancer less than 100 million years ago and finally reached 50¬∞ north at about the start of the last Ice Age. There are two types of serpentine at Kynance: bastite and tremolite. The rocks at the car park, cliffs to the south and the path to the cove are bastite serpentine, which is the primary serpentine on the Lizard. The rock is coarse-grained with large shiny crystals of bastite which give a flecked appearance. The islands and stacks within the cove and the valley are of tremolite serpentine which is fine-grained and banded. Tremolite is different from bastite serpentine because it was subject to higher pressure within the crust. Kynance Cove is an important site for geologists because of the exposures of the two types of ophiolitic serpentinite, together with granite and gneiss pods within the serpentine. The area has been designated as a Geological Conservation Review site. The National Trust cafe at Kynance Cove There are a number of small tidal islands and stacks within Kynance Cove which were formed because the tremolite serpentine was broken into blocks and invaded by other types of rock, including granite and basalt. These softer rocks were eroded by the sea and the four largest stacks from left to right are The Bishop, Gull Rock, Asparagus Island and Steeple Rock. It was thought that Asparagus Island, which is cut off on almost every high tide, was connected to the mainland by a sand tombolo. The winter storms washed the sand away to reveal a rocky ridge, probably formed more than 100,000 years ago when sea levels were higher. At about half-tide a snorting can be heard ‚Äì the sound of the Devil's bellows a blowhole on Asparagus Island which was caused by the sea tunnelling along a fault. A second blowhole, the Post Office is so named because there is enough suction to post a letter in it!

Popular culture Kynance Cove features in the 2015 production of Agatha Christie‚Äôs And Then There Were None, a period drama of three daily episodes first broadcast on 26 December 2015. It is also used as a location for the TV series Poldark (2015 TV series), as Ross Poldark‚Äôs beloved Nampara, and in the episode The Devil's Foot from The Return of Sherlock Holmes.

It encompasses most of the territories of Tigrinya-speakers (and a few minority groups closely linked with them) in Ethiopia; Tigray is separated from the northern Tigrinya territories by the River Mereb, now serving as the state border to Eritrea. The great majority of inhabitants are Orthodox Christians (95.5% in 1994), with the exception of a small, but important Muslim subgroup (Jeberti) and a few Catholics (mainly Irob). Protestantism is only a very recent urban phenomenon. Despite a general impression of ethnic and cultural homogeneity, there are a few ethnic minorities, especially at the borders of Tigray, belonging to a non-Tigrinya groups, such as the Saho-speaking Irob at the north-eastern border to Eritrea, the Raya Oromo in the south-east (mostly speaking Tigrinya today), the Agaw- speaking HÃ¨amta in Abergele north of Wag, a few Kunama in the Habesha Kunama woreda east of Humera, and scattered peripheral groups in the western lowlands, such as the Chare of the Sellim Bet (related with the Gumuz) and Tukrir in the Humera area. Some of these groups have adopted Tigrinya as their first language. Tigray's administrative capital is Mekelle. Administratively, Tigray was divided into four, later six zones (zoba), which replaced the former awrajjas in 1991 (names with number of inhabitants of the four original zones in the year 2005 with their capitals): Western Zone (ca. 1 million inhabitants; Humera), Eastern Zone (ca. 800,000 inhabitants; Adigrat), Central Zone (ca. 1.3 million inhabitants; Aksum), Southern Zone (ca. 1.2 million inhabitants; Maychew); in a recent administrative reform some of these were split and first a North-Western Zone (Enda Selassie Shire) and later a South- Eastern Zone (Mekelle) were created. Tigray went through numerous administrative changes in the course of its history. In 1991 Tigray was radically reshaped. During the reign of Haile Selassie I and also the following Derg period, Tigray did not yet encompass Welqayt (until 1991 having been part of Begemder), while Enderta in eastern Tigray extended over large Afar areas including the salt plains, which were given to Afar k…ôll…ôl. Still in the 1930s the regions south of Enderta, i.e. Wajjarat and Angot, formed the separate governorate called \\"Southern Tigray\\". Modern Tigray is the result of a merger of diverse historical northern provinces (with Tigrinya and Agaw speakers), which were often independent from each other. At the mid of Haile Selassie's rule of Ethiopia (in 1941 and 1943), Welkait, Tselemti, Raya (i.e. Lasta & Wag) and some other provinces (which all were mostly inhabited by Tigrayan people) were taken away from the governance of the old Tigray Province and they were given to Begemder and to Welo provinces. One of the reasons why Raya (Lasta and Wag) was given to Wollo was because Haile Selassie's son Crown Prince Amha Selassie was appointed as the governor of Wollo. Welkait and some other provinces were given to Begemder since there was armed rebellion in Tigray against Haile Selassie's rule (so it was part of the effort to divide and rule Tigray). Therefore, until the 1995 administrative reorganization, Welkait was part of Begemder province and Raya Azebo was part of Wollo. Welkait was then split into two parts once ethnic federalism was established in Ethiopia (in 1995). One of the two parts, which now turned to have Amhara ethnic majority went to the new Amhara Region's North Gondar Zone. The other (which kept the old name), still had a majority of Tigrayan ethnic people (over 90% Tigrayan ethnic people) so it was returned to the governance of the new Tigray Region (like it was for most of the 3000 years history of Ethiopia , before Haile Selassie changed it in 1941/1943).Bereket Habte Selassie, \\"Constitutional Development in Ethiopia\\", Journal of African Law, 10 (1966), p. 79. History Today's unity of Tigrayan territories south of the Mereb river is a rather modern phenomenon. Most northern provinces were ruled by their own governors, often descending from local dynasties and preserving a high degree of autonomy within the empire, e.g., in legal and judicial issues, taxation etc. Only rarely these territories were unified under one ruler. The core of today's Tigray was the most important northern province and bore the name \\"Tigray\\". Usually it controlled adjacent territories, which might be the reason why the term Tigray basically encompassed only Adwa, Aksum and Yeha, and regularly extended over Hawzen (with Amba Enda Seyon) and Enticho. It included sometimes wider areas, such as Shire and Tembien, which, however, kept their own separate identities and often their local governors. Hawzen was an important province seemingly already in Aksumite times (with important early rock-hewn churches); according to the , in the 13th century Hawzen encompassed wide areas from today's Hawzen to the Afar salt plains in the east. Consequently, over the centuries the realm of Tigray regularly extended over all these territories. Tembien was included into Tigray already in the 17th century, and at times also well before. An ancient permanent boundary of Tigray proper to the south is the Tekeze, in ancient sources equalled with the Nile River. Therefore, Tigray proper together with its dependencies was occasionally also called (\\"beyond the Tekezze\\"). Over a long period, the capital of Tigray proper was Hawzen in the sub-province Haramat. Already in the 17th century this town served as a seat of governors. In the 19th century it again served as the capital, e.g. of Wube Haile Mariam and negus Negusse. Adwa assumed the role of a capital in the 18th century under Amde Haymanot, and again later (starting from the 1880s in competition with the new capital Mekelle). Tigray was of strategic importance, both symbolically, as it included the sacred town of Aksum, and economically, due to important trade routes from the east (i.e. Agame and Enderta) and the north. It included fertile plains (e.g.,. to the west of Aksum), and strategically important mountains. \\"The one who controlled Amba Enda Seyon controlled Tigray\\" said Markham in 1869. Still in the 20th century, Tigray proper was a province of its own in the framework of a wider homonymous province, also called Tigray. Even if well before the 20th century occasionally the term Tigray already extended over areas outside of Tigray proper, local parlance preserved the old provincial names, and the term Tigray is still used by rural people of Tigray as referring only to Adwa awrajja, while other regions of modern Tigray are still considered to be \\"outside Tigray\\" by elders and rural people. Several names of the other northern provinces in today's Tigray are very ancient (for example, the Agame were already mentioned in the Monumentum Adulitanum), and persisted from their first mention in ancient inscriptions or medieval documents until modernity, while others only existed temporarily, shaped for the needs of newly appointed governors. Historical provinces are Shire, Adyabo, Haramat (with Hawzen), Geralta, Tembien (or Weri mallash, its border river Weri separating it from Tigray proper), Agame (including the Irob mountains), Sira (in the 20th century replaced by the Kelette Awlealo awrajja), Wemberta (with Asbi and Dara), Enderta (historically including the Arho saltplains of the Afar lowlands, with the Balgada, the controller of the salt trade), Sehart, Selewa, Wejjarat, Rayya Azebo (submitted only in the 19th century by atse Yohannes IV), and in the west Sellemt and W√§lqayt (originally encompassing only the Western Tigray highlands), and finally the Mezega lowlands including the former Muslim sultanate in the west successively included into the sphere of influence of Welqayt. Some smaller territories were at time independent form the rulers of these greater provinces; the exact boundaries could change quickly following the political (and military) fortunes of their rulers. The spiritual core of Tigray was and is Aksum. Even if being formally under the rulership of the central province (Tigray proper), the town enjoyed a special status, as a free city with its own self- government. Its administrators were the , a governor appointed by the Ethiopian ruler, and the , the mayor elected by the male members of the seven \\"Aksumite clans\\" of Aksum, , , , , , , . These encompassed the entire whole indigenous city population, who was not to pay any taxes. The represented the sphere of the Ethiopian state and often descended from the local leading families; if he was a layman, he appointed an (speaker of the ) for the administration of church issues. Aksum as the guardian of the Tables of the Law (, also identified as ; Ark of Covenant) was regarded as \\"a church\\". On this ground its priests did not allow atse Yohannes IV to permanently establish his royal there, who therefore used Mekelle as his capital. The city population managed to defend their traditional self-government - with the being independent from the - even throughout the 20th century politics of centralization by atse Haile Selassie I.  First mention of Tigray in ancient sources  The oldest inscriptions and texts referring to the population of the Aksumite kingdom and its neighbors do not know the term Tigray yet; they show an ethnic diversity, which has partially disappeared today. A variant of the term Tigray, first appears in a 10th-century gloss to Cosmas Indicopleustes, i.e. after the Aksumite period; according to this source important groups of the region were the \\"\\" and the \\"\\" (i.e. the Ag øazi), the latter being the Aksumites. The toponym Tigray is probably originally ethnic, the \\"\\" then meant \\"the tribes near Adulis\\". These are believed to be the ancient people from whom the present day Tigray, the Eritrean tribes Tigre and Biher-Tigrinya descended from. There is no indication that the term Tigray could be explained through Ge'ez (\\"subdue\\"), with the meaning \\"the submitted\\" (in supposed contrast to the \\"free\\" Agaziyan linked with the rulers of Aksum), as this could not explain why the area where the city of Aksum itself located took the name Tigray. The term might even not be Ethiosemetic and predate the Sabaen presence in Ethiopia. It is not excluded that the term (\\"Tekaru\\") from a list of southern peoples and countries allegedly subdued by Pharaonic Egypt in the 15th century BC may already be linked with the term Tigray; in this case it should mean a region within or in the vicinity of Punt.  Population history  Tigray was densely populated since ancient times; research in Lake sediments of Ashenge show that ecological change started with first dense settlements ca. 4,000 years ago. Today's Tigray region is the result of a complex process of internal migrations, cultural assimilation and also expansion (in western Tigray), as well as of unification, separation, and re-unification of diverse Tigrinya sub-groups and provides; starting from an early age Tigray was marked by dynamics of interaction between Cushitic-speaking groups (probably the most ancient population of Tigray) and Semitic-speakers, whose language and political culture makes Tigray deeply. Place names are usually of Cushitic and Semitic origin; several of the latter can be linked with toponyms in southern Arabia. Pre-Aksumite inscriptions show that Tigray was marked by a Sabaic- influenced kingdom (D'mt), which had merged with a local culture. In later Aksumite times migration again linked both sides of the Red Sea, with Aksumite settlements also on the Arabian side. Toponyms indicate that the Tigray highlands had an important (Pre-) Agaw population in ancient times (the house- style specific for Agaw regions reaching up to Aksum, in a region with Agaw toponyms); north of Tigray there was a Beja migration after the fall of Aksum, and later several migrations of Agaw groups. Overpopulated Tigray was a source for migrations over centuries, e.g., to the south, numerous southern groups claiming origin from Tigray. The history of migration also links much of the Eritrean highland population with Tigray. Oral tradition maintains that the Tigrinya groups of Hamasen and Akele Guzay descend from a 13th-century leader called negus Meroni in the tradition, who had led his followers from Tigray to the Eritrean highlands (assimilating the older population of partially Beja background). There are numerous other examples of groups who migrated from Tigray at different times. For example, oral traditions collected by Conti Rossini report on such migrations. The important sub-group is found both in Tigray and Akele Guzay. One of the last important migrations from Tigray took place in the 19th century, when atse Yohannes IV placed Tigrayan lords as governors over the Mereb Mellash (i.e. mainly the Eritrean highlands), such as was Alula Engeda from Tembien. Many Tembienay settled especially in the Asmara area, mixing with the local inhabitant. The foundation of the Italian Colonia Eritrea attracted further migrants from Tigray, including Muslim Jeberti merchants. The population of Tigray has preserved ancient self-designations, usually linked with the names of their historical provinces (at least some of which might originally have been ethnonyms); etymologically some can be linked to the Ethio-Sabaean past (e.g. S…ôra), but most are of unclear etymology. Inhabitants of Tigray call themselves (Tigrinya singular ; Amharic plural [neolog. from Ge'ez], ). Examples for other ancient province names and self- designations are: Agame, Rayya, S…ôra (S√§ba S…ôra; in the Atsbi area S…ôr…ôti for a sub-group), Tembien, etc. In oral tradition, the terms Again and Sabawiyan for the inhabitants of Tigray proper and Agame are still in use. Other ancient ethnonyms are still preserved in names of villages or small districts (e.g., the 8th/9th century G√§mbela, now a village south of Mekelle; the \\"kingdom\\" Agabo, known from the stelae of Maryam Anza, in village names in eastern Tigray).  Modern Tigray  Modern Tigray as a united province has its origin in the unification of its (sub-)provinces by atse Yohannes IV and his successors. This did not, however, change the ancient claims for autonomy by local leaders and by several quite egalitarian, non-feudalist peasant communities. After its heyday under Yohannes, Tigray was heavily challenged, and was gradually reduced in importance within Ethiopia, and outside influence within Tigray increased. Tigray oral traditions preserve numerous poems and legends which report on Tigray resistance against non-Tigray lords. Much of Tigray was briefly occupied by the Italians in the format of the 1896 Battle of Adwa. Against, Tigray was one of the major battle grounds during the Italian War 1935-36, with an initial success by the Ethiopians in the First Battle of Tembien in January 1936, and their dramatic defeat in the Second Battle a month later; after the Battle of Maychew in southern Tigray (followed by attacks of Rayya against atse Haile Selassie's army), the Ethiopian government collapsed. During Italian occupation, Tigray was included into Eritrea, and then after 1941 reunified with restored Ethiopia. Haile Sellasie's harsh measures to establish control by the central government, however, quickly led to local resistance. Significantly, the Woyone rebellion started in the province of Wejjerat, which was especially marked by egalitarian structures. After the rebels had captured the capital Mekelle, heavy bombing by the British in 1943 ended the uprising. This was followed by a further process of marginalization of Tigray, which was heavily affected by the 1970s and 1908s famines (often caused by resettlement measures). The decline of Tigrayan ethnic population in Ethiopia (and in present-day districts like Addi Arkay (woreda), Kobo (woreda) & Sanja (woreda)), during Haile Selassie's rule is likely to have been his immense oppression & systematic prosecution against non-Amhara ethnic people of Ethiopia (in particular, his immense systematic prosecution of Tigrayans). For example, on the 1958 Tigray famine, Haile Selassie refused to send basic emergency food aid to Tigray province even though he had the money; so in consequence over 100,000 people died of the famine (in Tigray province). Later on, the Mengistu Haile Mariam-led military dictatorship (Derg) also used the 1983‚Äì1985 famine in Ethiopia as government policy (by restricting food supplies) for counter- insurgency strategy, and for \\"social transformation\\" in non-insurgent areas (against people of Tigray province, Wello province and so on). Due to organized government policies that deliberately multiplied the effects of the famine, around 1.2 million people died in Ethiopia from this famine where majority of the death tolls were from Tigray province (and other parts of northern Ethiopia).  Cultural heritage  The cultural heritage of Tigray is particularly rich. Tigray hosts the UNESCO world heritage site of the Aksum stelae park, numerous medieval rock-hewn churches, with a special concentration in eastern Tigray and other church buildings dating from the ancient Aksumite period (such as Debre Damo monastery), often richly painted. Archaeological research has been able to document a great density of cultural remain from the Stone Age until medieval times. Tigray as the core of the Aksumite Empire bears the oldest witnesses of Christianization of the region. The monastery Enda Abba Selama, an important, but remote pilgrimage site in the mountains of Tembien, is said to host the grave of Frumentius; monasteries and churches attributed to the Nine Saints are found all over Tigray. The sometimes rich manuscript collections of church and monasteries are under threat due to economic decline of the Church (following the 20th century land reforms); they preserve some of the oldest surviving manuscripts of Ethiopia (such as in the monastery Enda Abba Gerima near Adwa). Most important for the reconstruction of the history of regional interrelations, political and genealogical alliances and dependencies, governors, and ancient administrative structure are land charters, documenting g'…ôlti and r…ôst rights. The most prominent text preserving legal documents-some allegedly Aksumite-is the Liber Axumae, which documents traditions on Aksum and Aksum S…ôyon, land rights, and duties towards the church. Written documents are amended by a rich, and often very strictly transmitted oral tradition on genealogies and land rights, poetry, songs and legends which form a rich intangible heritage of Tigray. In the course of history, many sanctuaries in Tigray were affected by war, especially in the 16th century, when the armies of imam Ahmad b. Ibrahim al- Gazi occupied most of Tigray, destroying churches and monasteries (however, the Aksumite Debre Damo, which offered refuge to atse Lebna Debg…ôl, stayed unharmed). A great part of the ancient manuscript heritage got lost in that period. As the home to the oldest Muslim population of Ethiopia, Tigray also possesses Muslim sites (especially the pilgrimage site of Negus; architectural remains in Weger Hariba, and possibly in Maryam Nazret) and inscriptions. In addition, during the 16th century a group of Portuguese soldiers together with Jesuit missionaries founded the settlements of F…ôremona, which included a Catholic church. After Catholicism was re-established among a minority by de Jacobis in the 19th century, some new churches were built.  Rulers of Tigray  A \\"Tigrayan dynasty\\" in the proper sense never came into existence, the competing dynasties of the respective Tigray provinces being too strong. At times, local provincial rulers managed to establish their rule over most Tigrayan provinces. Temporarily, the northern provinces were unified under one or two rulers, since at least the 14th century, mainly the T…ôgre M√§k√§nn…ôn, usually seated in the Hawzen or Adwa area (i.e. Tigray proper), and, further north, the bah…ôr n√§gash, who controlled the trade routes to the Red Sea. Only rarely were its territories united under one man; notable examples being Dejazmach K…ôfl√§ Wah…ôd in the late 16th century, the 17th century ruler Dejazmach G√§br√§ Kr…ôstos of Hamasen, in the 18th century Dejazmach Amd√§ Haymanot, succeeded by the much more powerful Ras Mikael S…ôhul, and, finally, in the 19th century Atse Yohannes IV and his family members. The 18th century Regent of Ethiopia Mikael S…ôhul formed a great Tigray, which after him virtually became a separate kingdom. He was succeeded by Ras Wolde Selassie of Enderta, who ruled Tigray independently in the Zamane mesafent; and he in turn by d√§ggiyat Sabagadis of the shum agame dynasty, whose successor was his son- in-law Wube of the Amharic-speaking Semien. Rulers of Tigrayan provinces were almost always of Tigrayan origin; in this sense, Wube's rule was a new phenomenon and is often perceived in oral tradition as a period of \\"oppression by an outsider\\". However, even the rule by Tigrayan princes were often perceived as such by locals, if they did not descend from their own local dynasties; this regularly motivated popular support to numerous competing princes (e.g., Kasa Golja against Kasa Mercha, the later Yohannes IV). There was no strong concept of a \\"pan-Tigrayan\\" ethnicity, local identities often being stronger. Some areas never or only rarely submitted to the rule of a Tigrayan overlord, but remained under their own autonomous rulers (such as Hamasen for most of the time, Welkait, Wajjarat, Rayya, Zebul, etc.); this was in a way solved by atse Yohannes IV, who due to his descent from all important Tigrayan dynasties could rally support from most Tigrayan regions. After his accession to the imperial throne, Tigray was governed by his uncle Araya Selassie Demsu, who died shortly after Yohannes. Araya successor ras Mengesha Yohannes, the Emperor's son, was only to some degree able to keep Tigray under his control. Atse Menelik II used the situation to partition again Tigray along older borders between several governors, who sent into war against each other immediately after his death (e.g. Gebre Selassie Barya Gabar of Aksum and Sebhat Aregawi of the Agame dynasty). Later, Tigray was given as a fief to other descendants of Yohannes. Thus the first \\"Tigrayan\\" dynasty was created, which, however, depended on support of the Shewan-dominated state. In a brief attempt to exploit Tigrayan discontent with Shewan rule for his own power interests, Haile Selassie Gugsa from that dynasty allied with the Italians in the war of 1935-1936 to become ruler of a more autonomous Tigray. This, however, proved to be a political miscalculation. Instead of becoming an autonomous princedom, Tigray was included into Eritrea within Africa Orientale Italiana. Only when the fortune of the Italian occupants changed in World War II, they placed negus Seyoum Mengasha as their governor over Tigray. After the Emperor's return from exile, he was confirmed as a governor (with the title l…ôul ras), but mainly nominally. His son, l…ôul ras Mengasha Seyoum, succeeded him in 1960 and was deposed in the Revolution of 1974. After that he was involved in the formation of the armed Ethiopian Democratic Union in the western lowlands, together with General Iyasu Mengasha. This \\"Tigrayan dynasty\\" strongly relied on Christian symbolism and deducted their legitimacy from their control of Aksum, which hosts the church Aksum Tseyon with the Ark of the Covenant. \\"Defined by its predominant Christian character, Tigray formed not only a durable component of the Ethiopian nation but was also part of backbone of the Ethiopian state\\". The rulership over Tigray (and Ethiopia) was occasionally identified with the rulership over Aksum Tseyon by powerful rulers with connection to Tigray. Consequently, even the term Tseyon (Zion) could be used in exchange with Tigray in specific contexts. Yohannes IV called himself negus tseyon. Creating a sort of spiritual succession, Mikael Ali called himself negus tseyon after his coronation as negus of Tigray in 1914 (he translated it into Arabic as \\"king of Tigray\\". Also the history of titles and ranks in Tigray shows interesting features and reflects the complex local systems of government. Tigray knows a wide variety of ancient state and cultural titles and designations of ranks and offices. Their meaning often differed from the meaning these or similar titles have acquired in territories further south (Amhara). Some are remnants of an ancient administrative system (many of these old titles have vanished today, e.g., the hasgwa and aqqabe sensen of Enderta), others are expressions of local cultural and socio- political structures (e.g., abba gaz; hanta, etc.).

He was signed by the Milwaukee Mustangs as a street free agent in 1994. He played college football at Toledo. McCollum also played for the New Orleans Saints, St. Louis Rams, and Detroit Lions. He earned a Super Bowl ring with the Rams in Super Bowl XXXIV. Nowadays Andy McCollum coaches the Eureka Wildcats High School Football team. He also coaches his sons football teams. Early years McCollum attended Revere High School in Richfield, Ohio. New Orleans Saints McCollum was a center for the New Orleans Saints from 1994 to 1999. St. Louis Rams In his first year with the Rams (1999), McCollum was a reserve offensive lineman of the winning team of Super Bowl XXXIV. McCollum took over from Mike Gruttadauria as the starting center for the St. Louis Rams in his second year with that team (2000), the first under first-time NFL head coach Mike Martz, their offensive coordinator of the previous year. Thanks to a strong offensive line of McCollum, guards Tom N√ºtten and Adam Timmerman, and tackles Orlando Pace and Ryan Tucker, the Rams won a wildcard playoff berth with a 10-6 won-lost record and 540 points scored (33.8 points per game, 1st in the NFL), but lost a wild card game of the 2000-01 NFL playoffs to the New Orleans Saints, despite Kurt Warner's 365 yards in the air, the offensive line allowing 2 sacks for 15 yards. The following year, the Rams' record was a powerful 14-2 and 503 points scored (31.4 points per game, 1st in the NFL), winning the west division title again. In the 2001-02 NFL playoffs with the same offensive line except for Rod Jones (offensive lineman) replacing Tucker at right tackle, St. Louis won the divisional round game against the Green Bay Packers and the NFC championship game against the Philadelphia Eagles with over 200 net passing yards in each game. However, the Rams lost Super Bowl XXXVI to the New England Patriots, despite 337 net passing yards. In 2002, Warner was injured for most of the year, replaced by Marc Bulger, less effective as the Rams missed the playoffs with a record of 7-9. With Bulger as the new quarterback, and Warner in reserve, St. Louis came back strong in 2003 with a 12-4 record, 1st in the NFC West, and 447 points scored (27.9 points/game), 2nd in the NFL. But in the 2003-04 NFL playoffs, the Rams lost to the Carolina Panthers in the divisional round, despite 316 net passing yards. In that game, as well as throughout the year, McCollum played left guard in place of the injured N√ºtten, with Dave Wohlabaugh at center. In 2004, with Bulger as the regular starter and McCollum back at center, the team was only 8-8, but still qualified for a wild card game in the 2004-05 NFL playoffs, beating the Seattle Seahawks with the same basic offensive line (McCollum at center, N√ºtten and Timmerman at guards, Pace and a new offensive right tackle, Blaine Saipaia. But the Rams lost 47-17 in the divisional round to the Atlanta Falcons, as they could not control Michael Vick's running and passing. The Rams did not make the playoffs in McCollum's last 3 years with the team, up to 2007, when their record was a dismal 3-13. McCollum started all 16 games for 6 years from 2000 to 2005, but played and started in 1 game in 2006 and started in 10 games in 2007. In 2006, he was replaced as the starting center by Richie Incognito. But Incognito was injured through most of 2007, starting in 4 games, and so McCollum returned briefly as the starter. In 2008, Incognito became the starting right guard and Brett Romberg among others became the center. Detroit Lions McCollum ended his career in 2008, starting 4 games, playing in 12, for a Detroit Lions team that finished with a 0-16 record.

The name Illubabor is said to come from two Oromo words, \\"Illu\\" and \\"Abba Bor(a)\\". \\"Illu\\" is a name of a clan, and \\"Abba Bor\\" was the horse name of Chali Shone, who founded the ruling family of the area when it was conquered by Shewa; hence IlluAbabor means the Illu belonging to Ababor(a).Yasin Mohammed Ruffo, \\"Border and Border-Crossing: The Case of Internal and External Migrants into and Out of Illubabor, 1904 - 1936\\", in AEGIS Cortona Summer School in African Studies, Borders and Border-Crossings in Africa, 16‚Äì22 June 2008, Cortona, Italy. (accessed 12 February 2009) Originally, its capital city was Gore, then around 1978 the capital was moved to Metu. With the adoption of new constitution in 1995, the territory of Illubabor was divided between the Gambela, Oromia and the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Regions of Ethiopia.  History  Illubabor was, by the late 19th century, an Oromo state facing the prospect of forcibly being absorbed into the Ethiopian Empire, whose reconsolidation of authority over long-abandoned peripheral territories had been intensifying since the ascension of Menelik II, who had begun his southern campaigns while King of Shewa, to the imperial throne in 1889. Invasion and reconquest The last king of Illubabor was Fatansa Illu. When the imperial forces invaded Illubabor in 1889, the king sent messengers to Kumsa Mereda of Leqa Naqamte and Abba Jifar of Jimma to form an alliance to resist the imperial army. Although the messengers were warmly accepted by Kumsa Moroda, when they presented their message he declined the offer, saying that the provincial forces could not resist Imperial troops well armed with modern firearms. The messengers who went to Abba Jifar were unsuccessful. Both rulers had previously secured their autonomous status from Menilek. Emperor Menelik II sent a message to Fatansa Illu where he was asked to submit to Menelik II's authority and that failure would lead to unnecessary deaths. Had Fatansa Illu peacefully submitted he would have been allowed autonomy under the condition that he pay the annual tax to pay for the defense of the empire. However, he refused and war was inevitable. Consequently, Ras Tessema Nadew led Emperor Menelek's force into Illubabor. When the lead elements of the Shewan forces reached the Gebba River, Fatansa's main forces began defensive attacks using spears and shields. However, when the major Shewan forces headed by Ras Tessema reached the Gaba river, the Illu defensive lines were broken and many villages were burnt down. After this incident the Shewan forces marched to the heart of Illubabor and camped at a place called Qarsa Gogila, near modern-day Metu. After realizing the strength of the Shewans, Fatansa Illu made a show of accepting the Shewan victory. Fatansa even prepared a fabulous feast for the Shewan at their camp at midnight. However, Fatansa had his soldiers surround the camp to make a surprise attack on the invaders and a bloody battle took place; Fatansa's forces were overwhelmed by the firepower of Ras Tessema's men. Fatansa was captured and imprisoned at Barroi, about five kilometers from Metu. Establishment of imperial administration Ras Tessema made Gore the seat of his administration. It was at this time that the semi-feudal system of neftegna, balabats, and gebbars was introduced to Illubabor. The Shewan officials and soldiers who settled in Illubabor, known as neftegna or \\"Musketeers\\", were assigned to a number of peasant households, or gabbars depending on their rank and position. A Dejazmach was granted 1,000 peasant households, a Fitawrari 300, a Kenyazmach 100 to 150; a Shambal 70 to 90; a Mato Alaqa 40 to 60, Hamsalaqa 25 to 35 and an ordinary soldier 5 to 10. Each peasant household had to go to the land owned by the overland and contribute his labor as a form of tax. The overland provided food and drinks. At the end of the work, each peasant went back to their land or business. Taxes were collected from every married couple. In addition to the tax [gabbar] sometimes the local farmers built the fences and homes of the overlord. They had to supply honey, butter, chicken and fattened sheep or goat on holidays. Each household had to produce fifty kilos of grounded cearls to each neftegna every month. Furthermore, the peasants had to transport grain crops to the nearest government granaries. If a gabbar failed to fulfill his duties, he would be summoned to the court. As C.F. Rey had noticed \\". . . The judges are the sub governor creatures of course take the side of the plaintiff in nine cases out of ten.\\" The neftegnoch could pass any judgment they wanted, short of capital punishment, which required Emperor Menelek's approval. But people were killed without even the consent of the governors especially in case of rebels or bandits. The importance of Gore as a center for invaluable export trade items in Illubabor depended upon smaller markets such as Hurumu, Noppa, Metu and Bure. By 1930 each of these markets had a population of about 500 including resident foreign merchants. Import trade items to Illubabor were textiles, liquors, sacks, salt, soap, ironware, abujedid, machinery, glass bottles (birrile) and others. Exported trade items included ivory, rubber, coffee, and wax. Ras Tessema monopolized the ivory trade and controlled it for his own benefits. He deployed spies and prohibited any one from engaging in selling and buying of ivory. Rubber grew wild in Illubabor, and Gore was the center of the rubber trade. This was exported to Europe through the port at Gambela. Another important item exported through Gambela was coffee, which was brought there through Gore and Bure. For the peasant society of Illubabor, the only means of earning money was to serve as porters of coffee, wax, hides, skins and salt bars between Gore and Gambela through Bure. The round trip journey took about eight to ten days. Porters were usually cheated of their earnings. A porter would carry a load with a certain weight and when he reached his destination, merchants would complain that it was some pounds lighter than what the porter had started with and thus deprived of most of his pay. It is important to note that the trade of the area was in the hands of foreigners and immigrants from the highlands and Shewa. Particularly, Ras Tessema and his officials benefited from the trade of the area. It is reported that he had frequently led punitive expeditions against the Gimira and captured thousands of slaves for himself and his soldiers. After the fall of Haile Selassie, the first Chief-Administrator of the Illubabor Province was Ato Hussein Ismail, a statesman belonging to the Gadabursi clan residing in Ethiopia appointed by the DERG, Tafari Benti. Reform and development When Lij Iyasu was designated as a successor of Emperor Menelik II, Ras Tessema was summoned to Addis Ababa in 1908 to serve as Iyasu's regent. Ras Tessema was replaced as governor by his son Dejazmach Kebede Tessema (1908 - 1910); Dejazmach Kebede did not make any changes in the administrative system set up by his father. He was in turn succeeded by Dejazmach Ganame. The process of land measurement began under this governor, which was one of the most dramatic consequences of the consolidation of the new system in Illubabor. This process classified the land into various categories. The major ones were: Yemengist Meret (government land), Samon Meret (church land) and Siso (land to the balabats, or local supporters). Government land was registered exclusively as government property. It was from this category that land grants were made to the soldiers, or granted to government employees in lieu of salary. Samon Meret was Church land given to the church and was cultivated by the peasants for its benefit. Siso was a portion of land that was allocated to the local supporters. The balabats were allowed to retain one-third of the measured land, and the rest went to the government. It was during the governorship of Dejazmach Ganame that the cultivation of coffee was further developed in Illubabor. Coffee became one of the most important trade items exported through Gambela to the Sudan. Traditionally, the Oromo cultivators were made to pay taxes on the amount of coffee they have actually picked from the trees and were permitted to retain those fallen coffee beans on the ground. In 1914 when Dejazmach Ganame started collecting taxes on the fallen coffee beans, the peasants protested against the new tax burdens. They sent a delegation to Addis Ababa to appeal the case to Ras Tafari (the future Emperor Haile Selassie. Dejazmach Ganame was summoned to Addis Ababa and ordered to cease this tax on the fallen coffee beans. Fascist occupation The Fascist occupation in Illubabor led to the disintegration of the Neftegna-Gabbar system. The Italians proclaimed that all the land in the area belonged to the Italian government, but allowed gabbars to use the land under better terms. The Neftegna were deprived of their usufruct and their leading members were exiled from Illubabor, which led to some of the local Oromos accepting the Fascist occupation. Despite this, some of the local ballabats remained and collaborated with the Italians in administrating Illubabor. These included Eba Seko and Marga Karo: Marga Karo administered the people west of the Gebba river while Eba Seko was in charge of the people living east of the riverThis narrative is based on the account in Yasin Mohammed Ruffo, \\"Border and Border- Crossing: The Case of Internal and External Migrants into and Out of Illubabor, 1904 - 1936\\". Post-war This was however reversed after the liberation of Ethiopia.

He spent seven seasons in the minor leagues, primarily with the New York Yankees organization. In his career, he had a win‚Äìloss record of 22-30, a 5.12 earned run average (ERA), and 425 strikeouts. Born in Beaufort, North Carolina, Taylor attended East Carteret High School, where his pitching ability caused him to be chosen by the New York Yankees with the first overall selection in the 1991 Major League Baseball Draft. After two full seasons in the minor leagues, he injured his shoulder in a fight, and was ineffective after returning to baseball. He retired in 2000, having never played a game above Class AA. He is one of three players to be drafted first overall in the Major League Baseball Draft and never play in the major leagues, along with Steve Chilcott and Mark Appel. Early life and MLB draft Taylor was born in Beaufort, North Carolina to parents Willie Ray, who worked as a mason, and Bettie, who was a crab picker at the local seafood plant. He was the second of four children, and was named after the lead character in the movie Brian's Song. Taylor attended East Carteret High School in Beaufort and played on the school baseball team. In high school, Taylor had a win‚Äìloss record of 29-6 and an earned run average (ERA) of 1.25. He also struck out 213 hitters in 88 innings pitched while walking 28. His fastball often hit 98 and 99 mph. The New York Yankees selected Taylor with the first overall selection in the 1991 Major League Baseball Draft, and he signed Scott Boras as an advisor, who said of him in 2006, \\"Brien Taylor, still to this day, is the best high school pitcher I've seen in my life.\\" The Yankees offered Taylor $300,000 to sign a minor league contract, the typical amount given to the first overall draft choice at that time. However, Boras advised the Taylor family that the previous year's top-rated high school pitcher, Todd Van Poppel, was given more than $1.2 million to sign with the Oakland Athletics, and gave up a scholarship to the University of Texas in the process. The Taylors held out for a three-year $1.2 million contract, even though they had less leverage because Brien's poor grades in high school prevented him from getting a major college scholarship offer. They threatened the Yankees that Taylor would not sign and instead attend Louisburg College, a local junior college, to get the Yankees to agree to their terms. The Yankees were without the official services of owner George Steinbrenner, who was serving a suspension at the time, but through the media, Steinbrenner said that if the Yankees let Taylor get away, \\"they should be shot.\\" Taylor signed for $1.55 million on August 26, the day before his classes were set to begin. Further delay would have meant the deal could not be signed until after the school year ended, which coincided with the following year's draft. Professional career The Yankees originally planned to bring Taylor up through the minor leagues rapidly, like the Mets did with Dwight Gooden. However, they found he needed a better move to first base to hold base runners, and chose not to expedite his major league debut. Before even playing a game, he was named the game's top prospect by Baseball America before the 1992 season. He began his professional career with the Fort Lauderdale Yankees, the Yankees' Class-A Advanced minor league affiliate. His performances with Fort Lauderdale included throwing nine strikeouts against the Osceola Astros in an 8-5 victory, as well as a 12-strikeout, two-hit performance in September against the West Palm Beach Expos. For the season, Taylor had a 6-8 win-loss record, a 2.57 ERA, and 187 strikeouts in 161.1 innings pitched. The next year, Taylor pitched for the Double-A Albany-Colonie Yankees, where the Yankees planned to have Taylor work on his curveball, as they already felt that his fastball was good enough for the major leagues. Entering the season, he was named baseball's second-best prospect behind Chipper Jones. That year, Taylor had a 13-7 record, a 3.48 ERA, and 150 strikeouts in 163 innings, and also led the Eastern League with 102 walks. In 1994, he was expected to pitch for the Triple-A Columbus Clippers of the International League, and start for the Yankees to begin the 1995 season at the latest, dependent on how he would have performed in spring training. After the season ended, the Yankees wanted Taylor to take part in an instructional league to work on his fundamentals. Taylor declined to attend the camp, and instead chose to return to his home in North Carolina. On December 18, 1993, Taylor was injured while defending his brother Brenden in a fistfight. The New York Times reported that Brenden confronted a man named Ron Wilson, who he had fought with in Harlowe, North Carolina. Brenden suffered head lacerations in his fight with Wilson. Once Brien found out his brother had been hurt, he and a cousin went to Wilson's trailer home to confront him. There, Taylor got into an altercation with Jamie Morris, Wilson's friend, and Taylor fell on his shoulder. According to Wilson, Taylor attempted to throw a haymaker at Morris, and missed, which caused the injury. In the hours following the altercation Boras told reporters the injury was a bruise. However, when the Yankees had Taylor visit Dr. Frank Jobe, he called the injury one of the worst he'd seen. The following week, Jobe repaired a torn capsule and a torn glenoid labrum in Taylor's shoulder, which caused him to miss the 1994 season. Taylor returned to baseball in 1995, and spent the season with the Rookie-level Gulf Coast Yankees. When he returned to the game, after surgery, he had lost 8 mph off his fastball and was unable to throw a curveball for a strike. As a result, in his first season back, he had two wins, five losses, a 6.08 ERA, and 54 walks in 40 innings pitched. The Yankees planned to have Taylor spend the 1996 season with the Double-A Norwich Navigators, but he continued to struggle with his control in spring training, saying at one point, \\"Sometimes I get the ball across the plate, sometimes I feel like I've never held a ball in my life\\". He instead spent the year with the Single-A Greensboro Bats and walked 43 batters in 16.1 innings, going 0-5 with an 18.73 ERA in nine games; the Yankees removed him from their 40-man roster as a result. Taylor spent the next two seasons in Greensboro. In 1997, he walked 52 batters in 27 innings, going 1-4 with a 14.33 ERA in eight games, and in 1998, he went 0-1 with a 9.59 ERA in 13 games. He was released by the Yankees at the end of the 1998 season, and signed with the Seattle Mariners the following year. With the Mariners, Taylor took part in extended spring training, and was released in June due to his inconsistency. After the 1999 season, the Cleveland Indians signed him to a contract and placed him with the Class-A Columbus RedStixx. In 2.2 innings pitched over five games for Columbus, he gave up 5 hits and 9 walks for a 27.00 ERA. After baseball After retiring from baseball, Taylor moved to Raleigh, North Carolina with his five daughters and worked as a UPS package handler, then worked as a beer distributor. By 2006, he had moved back home and was working as a bricklayer with his father. In March 2012, Taylor was charged with cocaine trafficking after undercover narcotics agents purchased a large quantity of cocaine and crack cocaine from him over a period of several months. He was federally indicted on cocaine trafficking charges in June 2012. Taylor pleaded guilty in August 2012 and was sentenced to 50 months in prison, followed by three years' supervised release; he was released on September 12, 2015.

As of 29 June 2020, the music video uploaded on YouTube via an official channel has garnered over 180 million views. The video was directed by Juuso Syrj√§, a.k.a. Uzi, and was shot in various places in Helsinki, including the Helsinki Cathedral and the Senate Square. It became the first Finnish music video shown on MTV in the US and it received several awards in Finland and on MTV. Usage in media=In film and television \\"Sandstorm\\" appeared on the pilot episode of popular Showtime series Queer as Folk, which first aired on 3 December 2000.. Princessofbabylon.com.

Detail from the Gemma Augustea, circa 20-30 AD A fully erected Roman tropaion with shackled and adorsed seated male and female Sarmatian captives (the right-hand female with head resting on hand, possibly a representation of the defeated \\"Sarmatia\\") tied to base. Dupondius from reign of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, AD 161-180 A tropaion (, ), whence English \\"trophy\\" is derived, is an ancient Greek and later Roman monument set up to commemorate a victory over one's foes. Typically this takes the shape of a tree, sometimes with a pair of arm-like branches (or, in later times, a pair of stakes set crosswise) upon which is hung the armour of a defeated and dead foe. The tropaion is then dedicated to a god in thanksgiving for the victory. Greece In the Greek city-states of the Archaic period, the tropaion would be set up on the battlefield itself, usually at the site of the \\"turning point\\" (Gk. trop√™) at which the routed enemy's phalanx broke, turned and ran. It would be dressed in the typical hoplite panoply of the period, including (at different times), a helmet, cuirass (either of bronze or linen), and a number of shields, etc., would be piled about the base. It remained on the battlefield until the following season's campaigns (since battles were often fought in the same, relatively few plains amid Greece's numerous mountains), where it might be replaced with a new trophy. In later eras in the Greek world, these tropaia might be vowed at the battle-site, but in fact erected at pan-Hellenic sanctuaries such as Olympia or Delphi to further increase the prestige of the victorious state. The significance of the monument is a ritualistic notification of \\"victory\\" to the defeated enemies. Since warfare in the Greek world was largely a ritualistic affair in the archaic hoplite-age (see Hanson, The Western Way of War for further elaboration of this idea), the monument is used to reinforce the symbolic capital of the victory in the Greek community. Another interpretation of the tropaion is that it was a monument dedicated to the slaughter of the enemy. Key passages describe that the tropaion was the last stage of battle, following the critical rout and chase of the enemy.Thuc. 5.10.12Thuc. 6.70.3 A critical passage of Thucydides suggest that the tropaion was set up to celebrate the enemy killed in battle.Thuc. 7.54.1 Ancient sources attest to the great deal of significance that early Greek cities placed upon symbols and ritual as linked to warfare ‚Äì the story involving the bones of Orestes, for example, in Herodotus 1 which go beyond the ritualistic properties to even magically 'guaranteeing' the Spartan victory, displays the same sort of interest in objects and symbols of power as they relate to military success or failure. Rome The tropaeum in Rome, on the other hand, would probably not be set up on the battle-site itself, but rather displayed prominently in the city of Rome. Romans were less concerned about impressing foreign powers or military rivals than they were in using military success to further their own political careers inside the city, especially during the later years of the Republic. A tropaeum displayed on the battlefield does not win votes, but one brought back and displayed as part of a triumph can impress the citizens (who might then vote in future elections in favor of the conqueror) or the nobles (with whom most aristocratic Romans of the Republican period were in a constant struggle for prestige). The symbolism of the tropaeum became so well known that in later eras, Romans began to simply display images of them upon sculpted reliefs (see image and Tropaeum Traiani), to leave a permanent trace of the victory in question rather than the temporary monument of the tropaeum itself.

Rail traffic occupies the lower deck of the bridge, while two lanes of road traffic occupy the upper deck. The double-decker bridge, about a mile long with a swing span of , was the longest and largest double-deck swing-span bridge in the world, when constructed in 1927. with It replaced an inadequate combination roadway/single-track bridge completed in 1887. The main river crossing consists of four Baltimore through truss spans and a swing span made of two equal arms, long. In 1999, it was listed in the National Register of Historic Places under the title, Fort Madison Bridge, ID number 99001035. It was also documented by the Library of Congress Historic American Engineering Record, survey number HAER IA-62. Construction and photographic details were recorded at the time in Scientific American magazine. The bridge is the eastern terminus of Iowa Highway 2, and the western terminus of Illinois Route 9. Iowa 2 runs westwards towards Farmington, Iowa, about , while Illinois 9 continues eastwards towards Canton, Illinois (about ) and Peoria, about . On July 26, 1927, operations were transferred from the original single-track bridge to the current double-track bridge. The first opening for river traffic occurred at 11:58 a.m. on July 26, 1927, for the scow traveling downriver with no barges attached. The bridge is privately owned by BNSF Railway and is the river crossing for the Southern Transcon, BNSF's Chicago to Southern California main line. About 100 trains a day, including Amtrak's Southwest Chief, cross the bridge. Amtrak's Fort Madison station is west of the bridge. Per Coast Guard regulations and the BNSF Fort Madison River Bridge operations manual, river traffic has the right-of-way over train and vehicle traffic on the bridge. The length of time for an opening varies due to weather, river current, size and number of boats, and occasional mechanical problems. A typical opening for a tow with 15 barges will take 15 to 20 minutes. The bridge logs over 2,000 openings per year, an average of more than five per day. Automobile traffic As of 2018, the upper deck of the Fort Madison Toll Bridge is open to automobile traffic. It is closed to semi-trailer truck traffic. The BNSF, which owns and maintains the bridge has posted the following limits: Gross weight posted as no more than 16,000 Pounds (8 Tons). Width: 8 Ft. Height: 14 Ft. 4 In. Length: 60 Feet.

He played in minor league baseball as a catcher from 1966 to 1972. Chilcott was chosen as the first overall selection in the 1966 Major League Baseball Draft, by the New York Mets. He is one of three players to be drafted first overall in the Major League Baseball Draft and never play in the major leagues, along with Mark Appel and Brien Taylor.  Early life  Born in Lancaster, California, Chilcott attended Antelope Valley High School.  Athletic career After graduating high school, Chilcott was chosen as the first overall pick by the New York Mets in the 1966 Major League Baseball Draft. In 1967, during his second season in the minor leagues, he injured his shoulder while playing for the Winter Haven Mets in the Florida State League. After reaching second base as a baserunner, he dove back toward the base when the pitcher tried to pick him off. As he dove back to the bag, he slammed into it with full force on his right arm, dislocating his shoulder and ending his season. Chilcott was plagued by injuries for the rest of his baseball career. The Mets released him in 1971, and he signed with the New York Yankees. However, he was released after only playing 24 games in 1972, and his athletic career was over at age 24. Chilcott never played higher than Triple-A, and is one of only three retired number-one picks to have never played a major league game.

It was founded as a coeducational academy in 1837 and sits on a campus.  History = New London Academy  A legislative charter was granted by the State of New Hampshire in 1837 to 11 New London citizens for the purpose of establishing a school in the town. The eleven men who were named as the academy's incorporators were Joseph Colby, Anthony Colby, Perley Burpee, Jonathan Greeley, John Brown, Jonathan Herrick, David Everett, Samuel Carr, Walter Flanders, Jonathan Addison and Marshall Trayne. It was a coeducational secondary school, for which Susan Colby served as the first teacher and principal. It opened with a student body of 26 girls and one boy, but soon enrolled 54 male students. In 1858, the New Hampton Literary and Theological Institution moved to Fairfax, Vermont, and the New Hampshire Baptists, with encouragement from former Governor Anthony Colby and New London's Baptist minister, Ebenezer Dodge, assumed responsibility for the Academy. The name was changed to the New London Literary and Scientific Institute. The new Board of Trustees was made up of 24 members, three-fourths of whom had to be from New Hampshire but not from New London, and three- fourths of whom also had to be Baptists in good standing.  New London Literary and Scientific Institution  In 1854, the Ladies Boarding House (later called Heidelberg) was built on what is now the New London green to accommodate up to 40 female students and the female faculty. Anthony Colby also purchased the original New London town meeting house and moved it to campus, where it was renovated to provide 20 double rooms for the male students. The building is called Colby Hall. In 1870, a brick Academy building was dedicated, located on the present site of Colgate Hall. The building provided dormitory space for 100 female students as well as classrooms, laboratories, library, gymnastic facilities, chapel, dining room, kitchen and laundry facilities. It burned in 1892.  Colby Academy  The New London Literary and Scientific Institution was in 1878 renamed Colby Academy in tribute to the ongoing support of the Colby family of New London. Financed by Mary (‚ÄùMellie‚Äù) Colgate, Colgate Hall was completed and dedicated in 1912, named in honor of the Colgate family whose members were dedicated supporters of the college. Colgate Hall housed female students, administrative offices, a library, dining room, kitchen, chapel, classrooms, and laundry. The male students continued to reside in Colby Hall.  Colby School for Girls to Colby Junior College for Women  After 90 years as a secondary school, Colby Academy trustees voted in 1927 to transform Colby Academy into a junior college and preparatory school for women. In 1930, 14 women received the first associate degrees conferred by Colby School for Girls. McKean Hall was built in 1930 and named for Dr. Horace G. McKean, Colby Academy's headmaster from 1899 to 1905. In 1931, Colby Hall was built, a residence hall named in honor of the Colby family. In 1931 Shepard Hall was built in honor of one of the original New London families who were trustees of the Academy and the College. In 1934 Burpee Hall was built, dedicated to the Burpee alumni, and trustees. The hall housed the library collection until 1949. In 1933, by an act of the New Hampshire Legislature, Colby School for Girls was changed to Colby Junior College for Women. The preparatory courses were phased out. On Oct. 18, 1941, Eleanor Roosevelt visited the college and gave a speech to the community at the Baptist church. In 1943, the college charter was amended by the New Hampshire General Court to allow the granting of baccalaureate programs.  Colby-Sawyer College  The Board of Trustees changed the name of the institution to Colby College-New Hampshire in 1973. In 1974, it was reported to the board that the college faced a lawsuit by Colby College, in Waterville, Maine, regarding its name, and so in 1975, the Board of Trustees voted to change the name to Colby‚ÄìSawyer College. The Windy Hill School, a child study lab school, was established in 1976 as a site for teacher internships and student practica. The Windy Hill School is now housed in the college's first building designed to be LEED silver certified (opened 2010) and remains one of the few lab schools in northern New England. In 1989, the Board of Trustees announced that Colby‚ÄìSawyer College would begin admitting male students beginning in the fall of 1990, returning the college to its coeducational roots. In 1990, the Ware Campus Center, formerly the Library-Commons building, was dedicated to Judge Martha Ware. In 1991 the Hogan Sports Center, dedicated to Daniel and Kathleen Hogan, and the Kelsey Tennis Courts opened; in 1994, Mercer Field was dedicated in honor of William and Ramona Mercer. In 1995, the Baker Communications Center was dedicated, named for Elbert H. Baker, distinguished in the communications industry and father of Martine Baker Anderson, a member of the Class of 1959. In 2004, the Curtis L. Ivey Science Center opened, and the student lodge was renamed the Lethbridge Lodge in honor of trustee and friend, George ‚ÄúBud‚Äù Lethbridge. In fall 2010, Windy Hill School moved into its new building, and in summer 2011, Colby-Sawyer introduced online summer courses. Colby-Sawyer was featured in the 2007 edition of U.S. News & World Report's \\"Great Schools, Great Prices\\" category of the top comprehensive baccalaureate colleges in the North.  Presidents  Dr. Sawyer served as president until his retirement in 1955, followed by Presidents Eugene M. Austin (1955‚Äì1962) and Everett M. Woodman (1962‚Äì1972). The college began its transition to a senior institution during the administration of Louis C. Vaccaro (1972‚Äì1978) and completed this change under the presidency of H. Nicholas Muller III (1978‚Äì1986). Peggy A. Stock (1986‚Äì1995), sixth president of the college, increased enrollment, completed a successful capital campaign, and constructed or renovated several buildings, including Rooke Hall. Anne Ponder became the seventh president of the college in March 1996; she extended the college's contiguous land holdings to , to build and dedicate Lawson Hall, and to enhance academic facilities and programs. Tom Galligan joined Colby‚ÄìSawyer College as its eighth president in August 2006. In July 2016, President Galligan was succeeded by Dr. Susan D. Stuebner as the ninth president.

The species was described and given its binomen by German physician Philipp Jakob Cretzschmar in 1828. Three subspecies are recognized. It is no longer present in Sudan. Since 1986, Soemmerring's gazelle has been classified as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Taxonomy and evolution Illustration of Soemmerring's gazelle (1867). The scientific name of Soemmerring's gazelle is Nanger soemmerringii. Formerly considered member of genus Gazella within the subgenus Nanger before Nanger was elevated to genus status, Soemmerring's gazelle is one of members of the genus Nanger and is classified under the family Bovidae. The species was described and given its binomial name by Swedish zoologist Philipp Jakob Cretzschmar in the In R√ºppell, Atlas zu der reise im n√∂rdlichen Afrika (\\"Atlas of R√ºppell's Travels in Northern Africa\\"; 1826‚Äì28) in 1828. Soemmerring's gazelle is named after German physicist Samuel Thomas von S√∂mmerring. Soemmerring's gazelle is more genetically related to Grant's gazelle (N. granti) and Thomson's gazelle (Eudorcas thomsonii) with Soemmering's gazelle being the closest relative of the two species. Subspecies Traditionally, three subspecies are recognized: * Sudan Soemmerring's gazelle (N. s. soemmeringii) (Cretzschmar, 1828) * Borani Soemmerring's gazelle (N. s. butteri) (Thomas, 1904) * Somali Soemmerring's gazelle (N. s. berberana) (Matschie, 1893) The dwarf population on Dahlak Kebir island might also qualify as a subspecies. Physical description Soemmerring's gazelle is a tall gazelle with tan flanks, gradually turning to white on the belly, and long black horns. They are about 75‚Äì90 cm (2.5‚Äì3.0 ft) at the shoulder, and they weigh 35‚Äì45 kg (77-99 lb). Soemmerring's and Grant's gazelles' outward appearance are so similar, they are often mistaken for each other where their ranges overlap. Distribution and habitat Soemmerring's gazelles is native to the Horn of Africa. It lives in Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and South Sudan. However, it is extinct in Sudan. They inhabit open steppes with brush and acacia, as well as steppes with few trees. At some point in history, a Soemmerring's gazelle population became isolated on Dahlak Kebir island in the Dahlak Archipelago, where the gazelle actually developed a dwarf form of the larger mainland races. Ecology and behavior=Diet The diet of the gazelle consists of acacia and bush leaves, grasses, and herbs. Reproduction Scientists suggest the males are temporarily territorial. The lifespan for this animal is up to 14 years. Threats Soemmerring's gazelle is listed as Vulnerable in the IUCN Red List. In many parts of North Africa and the Middle East, large stone corrals were constructed to drive herds of gazelle into, making for an easy ambush. This method of hunting started in prehistoric time, and continued into the early part of the 20th century. Most species of gazelles have been hunted for food over the course of history. Soemmerring's gazelles are very understudied due to their small numbers. In parts of their former range they are extinct due to hunting and habitat destruction.

It remains an area of mixed residential and small commercial properties, with a wealth of 19th-century architecture.neworleansonline neighborhoodguide - Garden District, Uptown, and Carrollton It includes part or all of Uptown New Orleans Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Boundaries and definitions Mardi Gras Indians, second lines, and Carnival parades are part of Uptown's traditions. Historically, uptown was a direction, meaning movement in the direction against the flow of the Mississippi. After the Louisiana Purchase, many settlers from other parts of the United States developed their homes and businesses in the area upriver from the older Creole city. During the 19th century Canal Street was known as the dividing line between uptown and downtown New Orleans, the boundary between the predominantly Francophone area downriver and the predominantly Anglophone area upriver. The very broadest definition of Uptown, historically, included everything upriver from Canal Street, which would encompass about one-third of the city. In the narrowest usage, as a New Orleans City Planning neighborhood, Uptown refers to an area of only some dozen blocks centering on the intersection of Jefferson and St. Charles Avenues. Neither of these is what most New Orleanians of recent generations usually mean by uptown. While some may quibble about the exact boundaries, Uptown broadly refers to the areas of the city closer to the River (river side of South Claiborne Avenue) and upriver from the Pontchartrain Expressway and the modern CBD/Warehouse District neighborhood. The boundaries of the federal Uptown New Orleans Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, are the River to S. Claiborne Avenue and Jackson Avenue to Broadway. Adjacent areas, which are often colloquially referred to as parts of Uptown are other federal historic districts: Carrollton, the Garden District, the Irish Channel, Central City, and the Lower Garden District. History Uptown was developed during the 19th century, mostly from land that had been plantations in the Colonial era. Several sections were developed as separate towns, like Lafayette, Jefferson City, Greenville, and Carrollton. For much of the 19th century most of what is now Uptown belonged to Jefferson Parish. New Orleans and Orleans Parish gradually annexed Lafayette (not to be confused with the present city of the same name in Lafayette Parish), Carrollton, and other communities from the neighboring Parish. This newly-absorbed area became known as uptown New Orleansprcno.org preservation resource center - neighborhood brochuresDying with history, in Uptown People from other parts of the United States settled uptown in the 19th century, joined by immigrants, notably from Italy, Ireland, and Germany. Uptown has always had a sizable African American population. Census data shows that ethnically and racially mixed city blocks were common in the 19th and early 20th centuries, which continues to be the case with much of Uptown. City of Lafayette The front gates to Lafayette Cemetery No. 1 Several small settlements grew up at steamboat landings a few miles upstream of New Orleans. The original Lafayette began as one of these. The sugar plantation once owned by Fran√ßois Livaudais, situated in Jefferson Parish along the Mississippi River between the present Philip, Pleasant, and LaSalle streets, was sold to developers in 1832. The Livaudais Plantation was subdivided and incorporated in April 1833 as the City of Lafayette and included the land which would later become known as the Garden District. The center of town was around Jackson Avenue. Lafayette was also the site of the original Jefferson Parish court house. The New Orleans and Carrollton Railroad, also incorporated in 1833, constructed a spur from the main line along Nyades Street (now St. Charles Avenue) down Jackson Avenue.Swanson, Betsy.

Cityscape A view of Loyola University New Orleans, adjacent to Tulane University from St. Charles Avenue Uptown was built along the higher ground along an old natural river levee on a wide, gradual bend of the Mississippi. Streets were laid out either roughly following the River's curve or perpendicular to it, resulting in what has been called a \\"wheel with spokes\\" street pattern (with the hub inland from Uptown, in the Broadmoor and Mid-City areas). Major roadways echoing the river's crescent include Tchoupitoulas Street closest to the river. Formerly heavily devoted to river shipping commerce, as shipping became more containerized in the later 20th century more of Tchoupitoulas was devoted to residential and other commercial uses. The next major street back is Magazine. While Magazine Street has only one lane of traffic in both directions, it is a major commercial district, known for its many locally owned shops, restaurants, and art galleries. Prytania Street is the next major street inland, although it extends only up to Jefferson Avenue as a major thoroughfare. Next is well-known St. Charles Avenue, home to the St. Charles Avenue streetcar line. St. Charles was the city's \\"millionaires row\\" in the 19th century, and a good number of the architecturally significant old mansions remain. But much of the avenue holds newer apartment buildings and commercial establishments, and some mansions have been converted to rental units. Farther back, the streets Simon Bolivar, LaSalle, and Freret form another parallel with the river. Farthest back is wide Claiborne Avenue, which until the early 20th century had a canal running down its neutral ground and was the back boundary of development until the drainage pumps designed by A. Baldwin Wood were installed (see: Drainage in New Orleans). Major \\"spokes\\" perpendicular to the river include Melpomene/Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard; Jackson, Washington, Louisiana, Napoleon, Jefferson, and Nashville Avenues; and Broadway, Carrollton Avenue, and Leonidas Street. Many of these were formerly the main streets of, or boundary lines between, the various early 19th-century towns which were absorbed into the city. Near the upper end of Uptown, on and around the land used for the 1884 World Cotton Centennial, are Uptown landmarks Audubon Park, Tulane University, and Loyola University. Neighborhoods and sections in Uptown Important neighborhoods and sections of Uptown include, going roughly upriver from Canal Street: * Central City * Garden District * Irish Channel * Faubourg Bouligny * Audubon/University District * Carrollton * Central Business District Some definitions of Uptown also include areas back from Claiborne such as the Broadmoor and Fontainebleau neighborhoods. Central Business District, historically also known as the \\"Old American Quarter,\\" was the earliest area called \\"Uptown New Orleans,\\" though many no longer include it in their definition of Uptown.

Hurricane Katrina Like most of the oldest parts of the city developed before 1900 on the city's higher ground, the majority of Uptown had very little flooding from Katrina For this reason, the portion of New Orleans along the riverfront stretching from the Bywater to Carrollton and including about half of Uptown was sometimes called \\"the Sliver by the River\\" and \\"Isle of Denial.\\" High water did affect some portions of Uptown, especially the areas closer to Claiborne Avenue, in some places severely. While 20th-century floods such as from the 1909 hurricane and the May 1995 Louisiana flood affected Uptown, the post- Katrina flooding was worse than anything seen since Sauv√©'s Crevasse in 1849. In these areas many old homes were built on piers 0.9 to 1.2 meters (3 to 4 feet) above street level to insure against the occasional disastrous flood.\\"Pier Foundation: what is it?\\" http://www.building-your-green- home.com/pier-foundation.html Accessed 30 July 2010. These piers proved to be insufficiently elevated, as the flood water rose an additional 30 to 60 cm (one to two feet). However, the area on the river side of St. Charles Avenue, and some sections farther back, escaped flooding. This was the single largest area of New Orleans to be spared the levee-disaster flood. For months early in the post-Katrina recovery, Magazine Street became a commercial hub of New Orleans, with many businesses owned and run by locals reopening before chain stores in the metro area.

Early life Archie Weller was born in Subiaco, Western Australia, and grew up on a farm, Wonnenup, near Cranbrook in the Great Southern region of the state. He attended Guildford Grammar School in Perth as a boarder. His mother was a journalist and his father was a farmer. As a young child Weller was encouraged by his grandfather to write. Writing Weller states he wrote his first book, The Day of the Dog, \\"within a period of six weeks in a spirit of anger after his release from Broome jail for what he regarded as a wrongful conviction\\". It won the 1980 The Australian/Vogel Literary Award, in 1982 the inaugural Prose Fiction award in the Western Australia Week Literary Awards, now called the Western Australian Premier's Book Awards, and was made into a film entitled Blackfellas, which won two AFI Awards in 1993. Weller's second novel Land of the Golden Clouds was published in 1998. Plot of Going Home The title story in the collection Going Home deals with the complexities of the Aboriginal identity in Australia. It is set in the 1980s and the protagonist has succeeded at university. He excels at sports, studies art and does paintings that are admired by the white community. But in achieving this acceptance he has turned his back on his home and his family. He feels white, but at the same time he is proud to be black. On his 21st birthday, nostalgia for his roots leads him to return to the camp of his birth, only to discover that his new \\"white\\" identity is invisible in the darkness of ignorance and prejudice. In contrast, another story in the collection, \\"Herbie\\", is about a white boy named Davey who witnesses the killing of an Aboriginal boy and though he is cruel to the boy and offers no resistance to the boys who eventually result in his death, the boy sympathises with Herbie's mother and shows remorse. In this story he portrays a boy who at the time has no empathy towards Herbie, an indigenous boy. It portrays bullying and brutal behaviour in a schoolyard with fatal consequences. Confession of a Headhunter The script Confessions of a Headhunter, which Weller co-wrote with Sally Riley, won an award in the 2001 Western Australian Premier's Book Awards, the Cinema Nova Award and the 2000 Australian Film Institute Awards for Best Short Fiction Film, and the 2001 Film Critics Circle of Australia award for Best Short Film.

It is affiliated with the Reform Judaism movement. Originally named Nidche Yisroel, Jewish Encyclopedia bibliography: *Archives of the congregations; *files of the Occident and of the local newspapers; *personal reminiscences of older members of the Jewish community; *Publications of the American-Jewish Historical Society, **No. 1, pp. 21, 22; **No. 2, pp. 65, 66; **No, 4, pp. 94-96. the synagogue was founded in 1830, and for the first fifteen years of its existence, services were held in a small room above a local grocery. It was originally an Orthodox synagogue, but became Reform officially in 1871. The pressure from the Congregation for modernization was such that its Orthodox first rabbi, Abraham Rice, resigned his position in 1849 over this question. In 1845, the congregation moved to Lloyd Street under the new name, Baltimore Hebrew Congregation. The new synagogue was dedicated by the Rev. S. M. Isaacs of New York and the Rev. Isaac Leeser of Philadelphia, together with the ministers of the congregation, Abraham Rice and A. Ansell (Anshel). That building, the Lloyd Street Synagogue, the third-oldest synagogue building in the United States, is now preserved as a museum. As the city of Baltimore and its Jewish population continued to grow, so too did the number of congregants, and thus also the size of its endowment. Thus, in 1891, the congregation moved to Madison Avenue, where it built a brand new building. This building, the Baltimore Hebrew Congregation Synagogue, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The congregation finally moved to Park Heights Avenue on the border of Baltimore City and Baltimore County, as the Jewish population fled to the countryside following the Second World War.  The Day School at Baltimore Hebrew  Under the direction of Rabbi Murray Saltzman, BHC senior rabbi at the time, BHC added a day school to its educational programming in 1991 for children from 18 months through 8th grade. In early 2008, it was officially renamed The Day School at Baltimore Hebrew. The Day School received accreditation from the State of Maryland and the Association of Independent Maryland Schools (AIMS), was a member of the Center for Jewish Education of The Associated, Progressive Association of Reform Day Schools (PARDeS) and The Association of Independent Schools (NAIS). It closed after the 2012‚Äì2013 school year. It was slated to reopen as a new school, The Independent Academy, as a joint venture with The Cardin School, but the Cardin school pulled out and closed and the new school did not materialize.

It is considered the most serious form of homicide, in which one person kills another with the intention to cause either death or serious injury unlawfully. The element of intentionality was originally termed malice aforethought, although it required neither malice nor premeditation. Baker (Glanville Williams Textbook of Criminal Law; London: Sweet & Maxwell, 2015), chapter 14 states that many killings done with a high degree of subjective recklessness were treated as murder from the 12th century right through until the 1974 decision in DPP v Hyam. Because murder is generally defined in law as an intent to cause serious harm or injury (alone or with others), combined with a death arising from that intention, there are certain circumstances where a death will be treated as murder even if the defendant did not wish to kill the actual victim. This is called \\"transferred malice\\", and arises in two common cases: * The defendant intended serious harm to one or more persons, but an unintended other person dies as a result; * Several people share an intent to do serious harm, and the victim dies because of the action of any of those involved (for example, if another person goes \\"further than expected\\" or performs an unexpectedly lethal action). Definition Murder is defined, at common law rather than by statute, as the unlawful killing of a reasonable person in being under the King or Queen's peace with malice aforethought express or implied. Actus reus The actus reus (Latin for \\"guilty act\\") of murder was defined in common law by Coke: The latter clause (known as the 'year and a day rule') was abolished in 1996 (see below). A further historic rule, the felony murder rule, was abolished in the Homicide Act 1957. Until abolition, the effect of this rule had been to create murder offences in two cases: when manslaughter occurs during the course of a crime it could in certain cases be automatically reclassified by law as murder; and that any deaths resulting from acts of a criminal during the crime could cause culpability as murder on the part of all his or her fellow criminals. The effect of this rule is partly retained despite abolition, since intent to kill is not necessary ‚Äì intent (including common intent) to cause serious injury is sufficient for murder if death results. =\\"Unlawfully\\"= \\"Unlawfully\\" means without lawful justification or excuse.Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice. 2009. Paragraphs 17-44 and 19-3. =Causation and foreseeability= For a killing to amount to murder by a defendant, at the time of death the defendant's acts or omissions must be the operating and most substantial cause of death with no novus actus interveniens (Latin for \\"new act breaking in\\") to break the chain of causation. Thus, the defendant cannot choose how the victim is to act, nor what personality to have. No matter whether brave or foolish, the defendant must expect the victim to: *try to escape and if he or she dies in that attempt, the chain of causation is not broken; or *try to fight back and so escalate the extent of the violence between them; or *seek medical treatment for the injuries sustained and, even if mistakes are made by the medical staff, this will not break the chain of causation unless the mistakes become the more substantial cause of death. There are conflicting authorities on the above point, R v JordanR v Jordan (1956) 40 Cr App R 152 and R v Smith.R v Smith [1959] 2 QB 35; soldier stabbed, dropped twice, poor medical treatment, defendant still guilty of murder In short, any contingency that is foreseeable will maintain the chain. Put the other way, only some unexpected act by a third party which places the original attack as a merely a background context, or some unpredictable natural phenomenon, will break the chain. =Life in being= For a killing to amount to murder by a defendant, the defendant must have caused the death of \\"a reasonable creature in rerum natura\\". The phrase as a whole is usually translated as \\"a life in being\\", i.e. where the umbilical cord has been severed and the baby has a life independently of the mother. The case Attorney General's Reference No. 3 of 1994 is a relatively recent case involving a murder charge for death of an unborn child. The Law Lords considered the case of a man who stabbed his pregnant wife in an argument. The wife recovered but delivered the baby prematurely. The baby died some time after the premature birth. The cause of death was simply that she had been born prematurely due to the effect of the attack on the mother, rather than due to any injury. In that case, Lord Mustill noted that the legal position of the unborn, and other pertinent rules related to transferred malice, were very strongly embedded in the structure of the law and had been considered relatively recently by the courts. The Lords concurred that a foetus, although protected by the law in a number of ways, is legally not a separate person from its mother in English law. They described this as outdated and misconceived but legally established as a principle, adding that the foetus might be or not be a person for legal purposes, but could not in modern times be described as a part of its mother. The concept of transferred malice and general malice were also not without difficulties; these are the legal principles that say when a person engages in an unlawful act, they are responsible for its consequences, including (a) harm to others unintended to be harmed, and (b) types of harm they did not intend. As such in the above case where a husband stabbed his pregnant wife, causing premature birth, and the baby died due to that premature birth, in English law no murder took place. \\"Until she had been born alive and acquired a separate existence she could not be the victim of homicide\\". The requirements for murder under English law, involving transfer of malice to a foetus, and then (notionally) from a foetus to the born child with legal personality, who died as a child at a later time despite never having suffered harm as a child (with legal personality), nor even as a foetus having suffered any fatal wound (the injury sustained as a fetus was not a contributory cause), nor having malice deliberately directed at it, was described as legally \\"too far\\" to support a murder charge. However, they did note that English law allowed for alternative remedies in some cases, and specifically those based on \\"unlawful act\\" and \\"gross negligence\\" manslaughter which does not require intent to harm the victim: Lord Hope drew attention to the parallel case of R v MitchellR v Mitchell [1983] Q.B. 741 where a blow aimed at one person caused another to suffer harm leading to later death, affirmed by the Court of Appeal as manslaughter, and summarized the legal position of the death of the unborn child: Four years later, the case St George's Healthcare NHS Trust v S R v Collins and others, ex parte S [1998] 3 All ER considered the willful killing of a foetus before birth, without maternal consent, in a medical context. It was held a trespass to the person that the hospital terminated the pregnancy involuntarily due to the mother being diagnosed with severe pre-eclampsia. The court held that an unborn child's need for medical assistance does not prevail over the mother's autonomy and she is entitled to refuse consent to treatment, whether her own life or that of her unborn child depends on it (see a discussion in Omission (criminal law)). It also can be contrasted against the United States Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004. Under this law, the intent to cause harm (mens rea) from the initial assault applies to any unborn child similarly to any other unplanned victim, and death or injury to the foetus is charged as a separate homicide whether or not the accused had actual knowledge or intent with respect to the child, or even knowledge of the pregnancy. =\\"Under the Queen's peace\\"= A killing is not murder if the person killed is not \\"under the Queen's peace\\".3 Co Inst 47Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice. 1999. Paragraph 19-18 at page 1564.Some of the sources cited by this section use the term \\"King's peace\\" because, at the time they were written, the Sovereign was male. This section follows the other source, in using the term \\"Queen's peace\\", because the present Sovereign is female. The killing of an alien enemy in the heat of war, and in the actual exercise thereof, is not murder because the alien enemy is not under the Queen's peace.Archbold's Pleading, Evidence and Practice in Criminal Cases. Twenty-third edition. 1905.Page 780. The killing, otherwise than in the heat of war, and the actual exercise thereof, of an alien enemy, within the kingdom, is not excused by the fact that he is an alien enemy, and can, therefore, be murder.1 Hale 433 (\\"If a man kills an alien enemy within this kingdom, yet it is felony, unless it be in the heat of war, and in the actual exercise thereof.\\") The effect of R v DepardoR v Depardo (1807) Russ & Ry 134, (1807) 168 ER 723, (1807) 1 Taunt 2b, (1807) 127 ER 739, (1807) 9 RR 693. is that the same rule applies where an alien enemy is charged with killing a British subject. See also R v Page.R v Page [1954] 1 QB 170, [1953] 3 WLR 895, [1953] 2 All ER 1355, 37 Cr App R 184, Ct-MAC Certain acts are excluded as murder, usually when the place or circumstances were deemed not to be under the Queen's peace at the time. Examples of killings not under the Queen's peace include the killing of an enemy combatant during a time of war or other international conflict. In the case of R v Clegg,R v Clegg [1995] 1 All ER 334. a soldier in Northern Ireland was convicted of murder after shooting into the back of a fleeing vehicle and killing a joyrider who had driven past the checkpoint he was guarding, although the conviction was later overturned on appeal. =Transferred malice= In English law, transferred malice (known in some jurisdictions as \\"transferred intention\\") is a doctrine that states in some circumstances a person who intends to commit an offence involving harm to one individual and instead (or as well) harms another, may be charged with the latter as a crime ‚Äì the mens rea (malicious intent) is 'transferred'. It may not apply when the crime which took place was different from the crime intended,E.g., R v Pembliton [1874] although a charge of manslaughter may be possible in such cases. =Common intent= As well as being responsible for any murderous consequences of his or her own unlawful actions that affect others, a person may also be held liable for the unlawful actions of others he or she acts with, even if not agreed or planned, if there is a common (or shared) intention (sometimes called a \\"common purpose\\"). In the 1998 case R v Greatrex (David Anthony), the Court of Appeal summarised some of the legal circumstances this can apply:R. v Greatrex (1998) EWCA Crim 976 (19 March 1998) In R v Gnango (2011), the Supreme Court controversially held under the doctrine of joint enterprise and transferred malice that D2 is guilty of murdering V if D1 and D2 voluntarily engage in fighting each other, each intending to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to the other and each foreseeing that the other has the reciprocal intention, and if D1 mistakenly kills V in the course of the fight. ='Year and a day' rule= The requirement that death occur within a year and a day of any injury for a killing to amount to murder was abolished by the Law Reform (Year and a Day Rule) Act 1996. Historically it had been considered that if a person survived more than that period after an incident, and died later, the incident could not be considered the proximate cause of death. Advances in modern medicine and patient care, including stabilized states such as coma which can last more than a year before death, made this assumption no longer appropriate. Mens rea (intention) The mens rea (Latin for \\"guilty mind\\") of murder is either an intention to kill (per the 2004 binding case of R v Matthews & Alleyne[2003] EWCA Crim 192) or an intention to cause grievous bodily harm (R v Moloney,(1985) 1 AER 1025 R v Hancock & Shankland,(1986) 1 AC 455 and R v Woollin[1999] AC 82). In Moloney, Lord Bridge was clear that, for the defendant to have the mens rea of murder, there must be something more than mere foresight or knowledge that death or serious injury is a \\"natural\\" consequence of the current activities: there must be clear evidence of an intention. This intention is proved not only when the defendant's motive or purpose is to kill or cause grievous bodily harm (direct intent), but when death or grievous bodily harm is a virtually certain consequence of the defendant's act (indirect or 'oblique' intent). Also in Moloney, Lord Bridge held that the mens rea of murder need not be aimed at a specific person so, if a terrorist plants a bomb in a public place, it is irrelevant that no specific individual is targeted so long as one or more deaths is virtually certain. Further, it is irrelevant that the terrorist might claim justification for the act through a political agenda. How or why one person kills could only have relevance to the sentence. Concurrence (simultaneity) For a killing to amount to murder, the actus reus and mens rea must coincide in point of time. The so-called single transaction principle allows a conviction where the defendant has both actus reus and mens rea together during the sequence of events leading to death. In Thabo Meli v R[1954] 1 All ER 373; [1954] 1 WLR 288 the defendants thought they had already killed their victim when they threw him over a cliff and abandoned the \\"body\\". Thus, although the act actually causing death was performed when the defendants did not have the intention to kill, the conviction was confirmed. Concurrence is also known as simultaneity or contemporaneity. Jurisdiction An offence of murder by a British subject \\"may be dealt with, inquired of, tried, determined, and punished\\" in England and Wales wherever in the world the killing took place and no matter what the nationality of the victim.Offences against the Person Act 1861, section 9 (as read with sections 5 and 22(1) of, and paragraph 5(a) of Schedule 2 to, the Interpretation Act 1978). =Visiting forces= Murder is an offence against the person for the purposes of section 3 of the Visiting Forces Act 1952.Visiting Forces Act 1952, section 3(6) and Schedule, paragraph 1(a) The terminally ill or incapacitated, 'mercy killings' and assisted suicide Euthanasia involves taking the life of another person, generally for compassionate reasons. It is distinct from assisted suicide, in which one person takes actions that helps another person to voluntarily bring about his or her own death, and distinct from refusal of treatment. Both remain illegal in the United Kingdom, despite multiple bills and proposals proposed to legalise some form of exemption in certain cases, or with certain safeguards, and polls suggesting that \\"80% of British citizens and 64% of Britain‚Äôs general practitioners\\" favour some form of legalisation. In such cases criminal charges, which may include murder and other unlawful killing charges, depend to some extent on the discretion of the Director of Public Prosecutions and whether a prosecution is deemed \\"in the public interest\\". A stated purpose of retaining this discretion is to allow human opinion, rather than codified rules, as a final decider, due to the highly sensitive circumstances typical of such cases, and to reduce the risk of persons killing or being pressured to take their own lives, if the law were codified more concretely. In 2010, the DPP was forced to publish the guidelines used by the Crown Prosecution Service to determine whether to bring a criminal prosecution in the case of an assisted suicide following a decision by the House of Lords in a case brought by Debbie Purdy, a woman with multiple sclerosis who sought clarity on whether her husband would be prosecuted if he were to assist her in travelling to Switzerland to end her life at Dignitas. Criticism and proposals to amend the lawJudicial views= The case Attorney General's Reference No. 3 of 1994 considered in some depth the legal basis for murder, manslaughter, transferred malice, and the position of an unborn child who dies before or after birth, and as a result of harm to the foetus, mother, or the natural processes of pregnancy. The primary ruling of the case, by Lord Mustill, noted that the foundation and delineation for several rules of law in theory and in historical terms was unsatisfactory, but that the rules themselves were very strongly embedded in the structure of the law and had been considered relatively recently. In particular, \\"the concept of general malice must be rejected as being long out of date\\". =Reviews and reports= In 2004, the Law Commission published an initial report, Partial Defences to Murder. It concluded the law on murder was \\"a mess\\"; a full review was announced by the Home Office in October 2004. The terms of reference were published in July 2005, and in 2006 the Law Commission published their second report Murder, Manslaughter and Infanticide which examined the law in these areas. The key recommendations included: * A three tier classification of homicide, by creating first and second degree murder charges, as well as manslaughter which would be retained. The distinction would be to allow a distinction between intention to kill (mandatory life sentence) and intention to grievously harm with a \\"serious risk\\" of death (discretionary life sentence). The second degree case would also include certain cases involving diminished responsibility, provocation or suicide pact. At present all murder convictions are simply described as \\"murder\\", argued by critics to attach the same emotive label to great extremes of circumstance. * Reforms \\"in relation to complicity in murder, diminished responsibility, provocation and infanticide\\"; * Consultation on whether and in what way the law should recognise either \\"an offence of 'mercy' killing or a partial defence of 'mercy' killing\\". Defences=Complete defences The first words Coke's definition refer to the M'Naghten Rules on the insanity defence and infancy. If any of the general defences such as self-defence apply, an accused will be acquitted of murder. The defence in the 1860 Eastbourne manslaughter case was that the schoolteacher Thomas Hockey was acting under parental authority in using corporal punishment (he was charged with murder but found guilty of manslaughter). Another defence in medical cases is that of double effect. As was established by Judge Devlin in the 1957 trial of Dr John Bodkin Adams, causing death through the administration of lethal drugs to a patient, if the intention is solely to alleviate pain, is not considered murder.Margaret Otlowski, Voluntary Euthanasia and the Common Law, Oxford University Press, 1997, pp. 175-177 The defences of duress and necessity are not available to a person charged with murder. The statutory defence of marital coercion, before it was abolished, was not available to a wife charged with murder.Criminal Justice Act 1925 (15 & 16 Geo.5 c.86), section 47 Partial defences The following partial defences reduce murder to voluntary manslaughter: *Loss of control, under sections 54 and 55 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. *Diminished responsibility (Homicide Act 1957, section 2 ‚Äì as amended) *Suicide pact, under section 4 of the Homicide Act 1957 Section 1(2) of the Infanticide Act 1938 creates a partial defence which reduces murder to the offence of infanticide under section 1(1) of that Act. If a partial defence is successful, it will allow the sitting judge full discretion as to the sentence given to the offender; these can range from a conditional discharge to a life sentence (which accounts for around 10 percent of voluntary manslaughter sentences). Proceedings=Restriction on institution of proceedings Proceedings against a person for murder, if the injury alleged to have caused the death was sustained more than three years before the death occurred, or the person has previously been convicted of an offence committed in circumstances alleged to be connected with the death, may only be instituted by or with the consent of the Attorney General.Law Reform (Year and a Day Rule) Act 1996, sections 2(1) and 2(2) and 2(3)(a) Indictment A count charging a single principal offender with murder will now be in the following form:Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice, 1999, para. 19-85 at p. 1584The Inns of Court School of Law. Drafting Manual. 2001. The date which is specified in the indictment is the date on which the deceased died, because the offence is not complete until that date. =Joinder of counts= A count of murder may be joined with a count charging another offence of murder,R v Kray [1970] 1 QB 125, 53 Cr App R 569, [1969] 3 WLR 831, [1969] 3 All ER 941, CA or a count charging a different offence.Connelly v Director of Public Prosecutions [1964] AC 1254, [1964] 2 WLR 1145, [1964] 2 All ER 401, 48 Cr App R 183, HL A count of conspiracy to murder may be joined with a count of aiding and abetting murder.R v Schepke, The Times, 4 May 1995, CA In R v Greatrex (David Anthony),R v Greatrex (David Anthony) [1999] 1 Cr App R 126, [1998] Crim LR 735, The Times, 2 April 1998, CA Beldam LJ said: Alternative verdict On the trial of an indictment for murder, the jury cannot return an alternative verdict to the offence charged in that indictment under section 6(3) of the Criminal Law Act 1967, except for the offences listed below: *ManslaughterThe Criminal Law Act 1967, section 6(2)(a) *Causing grievous bodily harm with intent to do so, contrary to section 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 *Any offence of which a person found not guilty of murder may be found guilty under an enactment specifically so providing,The Criminal Law Act 1967, section 6(2)(b) namely: **Child destruction, contrary to section 1(1) of the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929Criminal Law Act 1967, section 6(2)(b) and the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929, section 2(2) **Infanticide, contrary to section 1(1) of the Infanticide Act 1938Criminal Law Act 1967, section 6(2)(b) and the Infanticide Act 1938, section 1(2) **Aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring suicide or an attempt to commit suicide, contrary to section 2(1) of the Suicide Act 1961Criminal Law Act 1967, section 6(2)(b) and the Suicide Act 1961, section 2(2) *Any offence of which a person found not guilty of murder may be found guilty under section 4(2) of the Criminal Law Act 1967 (assisting an offender, i.e. doing \\"any act with intent to impede [the murderer's] apprehension or prosecution\\", given that the jury believe that the offence (of murder) was committed, though not necessarily by the defendant). *Attempted murder, or an attempt to commit any other offence of which a person found not guilty of murder may be found guilty, contrary to section 1(1) of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981.Criminal Law Act 1967, section 6(2)(c) For this purpose each count is considered to be a separate indictment.Criminal Law Act 1967, section 6(7) Mode of trial Murder is an indictable-only offence. Sentencing The sentence for murder is, in all cases, mandatory and depends upon the age of the offender at the time of the crime or conviction.Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice. 1999. Paragraph 19-92 p. 1585. Where a person convicted of murder appears to the court to have been age under eighteen at the time of the offence was committed, the court must sentence the guilty party to be detained during Her Majesty‚Äôs pleasure.Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000, section 90; this section replaces section 53(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 In any other case, where a person age under twenty-one is convicted of murder the court must sentence that person to custody for life.Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000, section 93. Section 93 replaces section 8(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1982. Section 93 will be repealed by sections 74 and 75 of, and paragraph 182 of Schedule 7 to, and Schedule 8 to, the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 when it comes into force. Section 61 of that Act will abolish the sentence of custody for life when it comes into force. In any other case, a person convicted of murder must be sentenced to imprisonment for life.Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965, section 1(1) Since the abolition of capital punishment, murder has carried a mandatory life sentence in English law. this comprises three elements: # A minimum term, often called a \\"tariff\\", set by the judge, representing retributive justice without any prospect of parole. This may be appealed by the individual or, if considered unduly lenient, by the Attorney General; # Until otherwise decided, continuing incarceration running from the expiry of the minimum term until the parole board considers the person may safely be \\"released on licence\\", i.e., upon conditions known as \\"early release provisions\\",Criminal Justice and Courts Services Act 2000 s.82A (as enacted) based upon consideration of the risk posed to the public by the person; # At any time the licence may be revoked and the offender recalled to prison until it is considered safe to release him or her again on licence. This element does, in a real sense, represent a life sentence and affords a degree of ongoing deterrence and improved public safety after release. Tariff system The tariff sets the minimum time that must be spent in prison before an offender can be considered for parole. Following the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in T v UK(2000) 30 EHRR 121 and the consequent statutory change (enacted as Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 s 60), the judge must indicate in open court the appropriate tariff for an offender aged under 18 who is convicted of murder. The period specified by the judge is a 'sentence', which may, with the leave of the Court of Appeal, be appealed or be the subject of an Attorney General's Reference.McBean (2002) 1 Cr. App. R. (S) 98 Criminal Justice Act 2003 s 271 sets the same rule for adults. The Practice statement (Life sentences for murder)Practice statement (Life sentences for murder) (2000) 2 Cr. App. R. 457 set the tariff for adults, i.e. one aged 18 or over at the time of the offence, with a starting point of 14 years as the minimum term for a case with no aggravating or mitigating factors, and lists the factors which might suggest either a higher or a lower than normal minimum term in an individual case. Mitigating factors include a mental illness, battered woman syndrome, using excessive force in self-defence or mercy killing. Assassination, contract killing, killing to subvert the justice system (such as killing a witness, etc.) are aggravating factors. The statutory guidelines and case law on sentencing are covered in the Crown Prosecution Sentencing Manual. The trial judge has always been expected to make a recommended minimum term. In 1983 the Home Secretary began amending, usually increasing, the minimum term recommended by the trial judge; this system was declared illegal in 2002 by both the High Court and the European Court of Human Rights following a successful challenge by convicted murderer Anthony Anderson. Anderson had been convicted of a double murder in 1988 and the trial judge recommended that he should serve at least 15 years before being considered for parole, but six years later his tariff was increased to 20 years by Home Secretary Michael Howard. Since then trial judges have been obliged to recommend a minimum term; only the Lord Chief Justice has the power to make any amendments, either through an appeal by the Attorney General to increase a sentence which is seen as unduly lenient, or an appeal by the prisoner to have the minimum term reduced. Life imprisonment has been the only option that judges have had when sentencing murderers since the death penalty was abolished in 1965. The average prisoner sentenced to life imprisonment spends 14 years behind bars. More serious cases, which included aggravating factors such as a rape or robbery, have led to murderers spending 20 or more years in prison. A few multiple murderers have remained in prison until their deaths; these include Myra Hindley and Ronnie Kray. An estimated 20 prisoners in Britain have been recommended for lifelong imprisonment; these include Mark Hobson, Donald Neilson, Dennis Nilsen, Jeremy Bamber and Steve Wright. Lengthy minimum terms have also been imposed on some killers including 40 years on Ian Huntley and 35 years on Robert Black. Criminal Justice Act 2003 The Criminal Justice Act 2003 changed the law so that instead of the Home Secretary having discretion to modify judicial sentences (which might have been seen as unjustly subject to populism and political considerations), all appeals whether by the subject or by the Attorney General (for \\"unduly lenient\\" sentences) are submitted to the Court of Appeal, with the leave of that court, for a ruling. To ensure the right of judges was used reasonably, the Act stipulated standard \\"starting points\\", and typical aggravating and mitigating factors. While judges were allowed discretion to set any minimum sentence or \\"whole life\\" term, their reasoning for departure from these was to be provided. The Act also states that in considering an appeal of a minimum term (by any party), the Court of Appeal shall not make any allowance in respect of the (slightly inaccurately described) \\"double jeopardy\\" discount, whereby the uncertainty and distress to the respondent prisoner of being sentenced a second time is considered as mitigation.Criminal Justice Act 2003, s.272 =Starting points, post-2003= Under schedule 21 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003 the starting points for murders committed on or after 18 December 2003Section 336(2) are as follows. Where a crime falls into multiple categories, the applicable starting point is the highest: ; Whole life starting point (schedule 21, paragraph 4) :A whole life starting point would normally be appropriate for the following \\"exceptionally high seriousness offences\\" (or multiple offences committed together and considered as a whole) committed by a person age 21 or over: :* the murder of two or more persons, where each murder involves any of the following- :** a substantial degree of premeditation or planning, :** the abduction of the victim, or :** sexual or sadistic conduct :* the murder of a child if involving the abduction of the child or sexual or sadistic motivation :* the murder of a police officer or prison officer in the course of his duty (on or after 13 April 2015) (this was added by section 27 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015) :* a murder done for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause. (The Counter-Terrorism Act 2008 adds \\"racial cause\\" to these, from 16 February 2009Criminal Justice Act 2008 s.75 and Criminal Justice Act 2003 schedule 21 para 4(2)(c) as modified) :* a murder by an offender previously convicted of murder ; 30 year minimum starting point (schedule 21 paragraph 5) :A 30 year starting point would normally be appropriate for the following \\"particularly high seriousness offences\\" (or multiple offences committed together and considered as a whole) committed by a person age 18 or over. In Griffiths and others v R (2012)[2012] EWCA Crim 2822 the Court of Appeal said that this list is not exhaustive. :* the murder of a police officer or prison officer in the course of his duty (before 13 April 2015) :* a murder involving the use of a firearm or explosive :* a murder done for gain (in furtherance of robbery or burglary, done for payment or done in the expectation of gain as a result of the death) :* a murder intended to obstruct or interfere with the course of justice :* a murder involving sexual or sadistic conduct :* the murder of two or more persons :* a murder that is racially or religiously aggravated or aggravated by sexual orientation :* a murder normally resulting in a whole life tariff committed by a person aged 18 or over but under 21 ; 25 year minimum starting point (schedule 21 paragraph 5A) :A 25 year starting point was later added (as of 2 March 2010) for the circumstance where a person age 18 or over takes a weapon to \\"the scene\\" intending to either commit any offence, or have it available as a weapon, and used that weapon to commit the murder.The Criminal Justice Act 2003 (Mandatory Life Sentence: Determination of Minimum Term) Order 2010 section 2, a statutory instrument 2010 No. 197. Criminal Justice Act 2003 schedule 21 para 4(2)(c) as modified ; 15 year minimum (schedule 21 paragraph 6) :Any other murder committed by a person age 18 or over ; 12 year minimum (schedule 21 paragraph 7) :Any other murder committed by someone under the age of 18 Related proceedings and crimes=Coroner verdicts In the case of death arising violently or \\"unnaturally\\", suddenly with an unknown cause; or in prison or police custody, there is a duty to hold an inquest (a formal inquiry) to ascertain the identity of the deceased, time and place of death, and method of death (but no further specific allegations). A range of verdicts are possible; cases where murder is a consideration are likely to return a coroner's verdict of unlawful killing, covering all unlawful killings and in particular murder, manslaughter and infanticide. The standard for this ruling is beyond reasonable doubt; failure to meet this standard would usually result in a verdict of accidental death or death by misadventure,Lord Mackay of Clashfern (ed.) (2006) Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th ed. reissue, vol.9(2), \\"Coroners\\", 1043. Killed unlawfully or an open verdict where the cause is not known. Other verdicts possible cover suicide, accident, execution of sentence of death and lawful killing (formerly \\"justifiable homicide\\"). The verdict does not name individuals as responsible parties. Civil claims ('wrongful death') Wrongful death is a civil action brought against a person who has wrongfully caused the death of another person. Under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 a claim may only be brought for the benefit of certain classes of people, mostly close relatives, and usually by the executor or (failing this) any person for whose benefit a claim could have been made. Claims can cover economic loss, grief, and funeral expenses. Historically under common law, a dead person could not bring a suit, and this created a loophole in which activities that resulted in a person's injury might result in a claim for damages and other remedies, but activities that resulted in a person's death would not. The rapid development of railways in the 1830s led to increasing outcry over the indifferent attitudes of railway companies to railway-related deaths, leading to the Fatal Accidents Act 1846 (later superseded by the Fatal Accidents Act 1976) which gave personal representatives the right to bring a legal action for damages where the deceased person had such a right at the time of their death. Compensation was restricted at the time to the husband, parent, or child of the deceased. Related offences The following inchoate offences relate to the substantive offence of murder: * Attempted murder * Soliciting to murder * Conspiracy to murder History Provocation was formerly a partial defence to murder.

That Act came into operation of 1 September 1851.Criminal Procedure Act 1851, section 31 That section was replaced by section 6 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 provided that in any indictment for murder, it was not necessary to set forth the manner in which, or the means by which, the death of the deceased was caused, but it was to be sufficient in any indictment for murder to charge that the defendant did feloniously, wilfully, and of his malice aforethought kill and murder the deceased. That section was repealed by the Indictments Act 1915. The following specimen count was contained in paragraph 13 of the Second Schedule to the Indictments Act 1915 before it was repealed.

It seats 2,225. The Caulkins family pledged $7 million towards the enhancement of the lyric opera house and adjacent public spaces which were constructed inside of the Newton Auditorium. History of the theatre  The outside of the Opera House, with a view of its original entrance on Champa Street. The Municipal Auditorium, the largest in America except for Madison Square Garden in New York, was completed in time to host the Democratic National Convention in 1908. Mayor Speer and the Chamber of Commerce raised $100,000 to celebrate the July 7 grand opening of the Auditorium with Denver's first national political convention, when William Jennings Bryan was nominated to run for President for the third time. Originally, the building was a multi-purpose structure: it accommodated concerts, operas, theatrical shows, conventions, basketball, auto shows and even circuses, with flags flying from its domes and light bulbs outlining its pediments, cornice, and corners. The proscenium of the original building was designed to be portable so as to create different-sized spaces for different events. When the proscenium was in place, the building was a 3,326-seat theatre with an extraordinarily large backstage area. When the proscenium was raised, increasing the seating capacity to 12,000, the stage and backstage area became large enough to hold circuses and rodeos. For several years in the 1920s and 1930s, Music Week was an annual event in Denver. Various communities of the state presented musical programs and most of the performances were in the Auditorium. An opera or operetta was commonly included in the offerings. In 1921, a company of Denver musicians performed Flotow's Martha in May; of special historical significance was the fact that the two performances were broadcast by radio station 9ZAF, the first time ever that a full-length opera was broadcast. The Auditorium became the de facto opera house for Denver, and the most enduring. For more than 75 years, until the 1980s and 1990s when other halls opened in an adjoining complex, the Auditorium hosted almost all visiting opera companies and opera concerts, as well as local opera productions. In 1955 the Auditorium was closed and renovation was begun to make the grand old house a modern theatre. In September 1956, the project was completed and the seating capacity was decreased to 2,240. In the 1980s other theaters were constructed next to the Auditorium, including Boettcher Concert Hall, Bonfils Theatre Complex and the Denver Center Theatre, to which the Seawell Ballroom was added in the 1990s (these now make up the Denver Performing Arts Complex). The Auditorium arena received another makeover in the early 1990s when the Temple Hoyne Buell Theater was built into it. This theater was a reincarnation of the Municipal Auditorium's old theater and basketball and wrestling arena. In 1992, after the construction of the Buell Theatre, the facade of the Municipal Auditorium was renovated and the seating capacity became 2,065. The Auditorium was renamed Quigg Newton Denver Municipal Auditorium in 2002.  Renovations  In need of major work, the Newton Auditorium underwent a renovation funded primarily through seat tax revenues collected at city-owned facilities and the proceeds of a bond issue approved by Denver voters in 2002.\\"Caulkins Family Makes Generous Contribution to the City of Denver's Newton Auditorium Renovation\\" (see below) In all, the city spent $75 million, while private donors provided $17 million more. The gift from the Caulkins family was used to fund additional enhancements to the lyric opera house and adjacent public spaces inside the Newton Auditorium. The ‚ÄúEllie‚Äù opened as Opera Colorado's new home on September 10, 2005 with a gala benefit for the Colorado Opera Foundation and featured some major singers from the world of opera. Opera Colorado's first season in the new opera house opened on November 3, 2005 with a production of Carmen starring internationally known mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves in the title role. The historic shell of the old Auditorium Theatre was rebuilt and named the Ellie Caulkins Opera House, honoring \\"Denver's First Lady of Opera\\". The architect of record, Semple Brown Design, created the performance space, described as \\"three tiers of balconies curve like lyres; uninterrupted sight lines from every seat focus viewers onto a deep, wide stage....

Successful in shifting the theatre of war into the Hellespont, he then experienced a string of defeats; in the third and final of these, he was killed and the entire Peloponnesian fleet was captured or destroyed. Relocation and early battles :Main articles: Battle of Cynossema, Battle of Abydos Mindarus first took command of the fleet at Miletus, where the satrap Tissaphernes had promised the Spartans they would be joined by the sizeable Phoenician fleet under his command. After several months of waiting, Mindarus realized that no such fleet would be forthcoming, and made the strategic decision to relocate his fleet to the Hellespont, where the satrap Pharnabazus had promised him greater support than he was receiving from Tissaphernes.Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 402 Mindarus set out from Miletus with 73 ships; a storm forced him ashore at Chios, but he remained there only a few days. Sailing with haste to avoid an Athenian fleet that had been brought up from Samos to oppose him, he succeeded in bringing his fleet between Lesbos and the mainland and into the Hellespont, where he brushed aside a small Athenian fleet and joined the few allied ships in the region in the Spartan base at Abydos.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War 1.99-103 With this strategic move, Mindarus had placed his fleet in position to cut off the Athenian grain supply, and had forced the Athenian fleet to challenge him on ground of his choosing.Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 403-4. From this point onwards, however, Mindarus' luck turned sour. Five days after his arrival at Abydos, the Athenians sailed into the narrow waters of the Hellespont to engage his numerically superior force. In the resulting battle, Peloponnesian victory appeared within grasp in the early going, as the Athenian left was cut off and the centre driven ashore on the promontory of Cynossema; superior seamanship on the part of the Athenian captains and sailors, however, turned the tide of the battle, and Mindarus' fleet fled back to Abydos with losses.See Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War 8.104-7 for an account of the battle, and Diodorus Siculus, Library 13.40.2-3 for a description of the superior Athenian seamanship. See Kagan, The Peloponnesian War 404-6, for a synthesis. Mindarus summoned reinforcements to him at Abydos, but suffered a second defeat when a small group of ships sailing to join him there was trapped by the Athenian fleet; Mindarus sailed out to rescue them, but, after a hard fought battle, the arrival of Alcibiades with Athenian reinforcements turned the battle into a rout, with the Peloponnesians again suffering losses in their flight back to Abydos.Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 408-9. Cyzicus Over the next several months, Mindarus, with financial support from Pharnabazus, rebuilt his fleet to 80 triremes by the spring of 410 BC. Sailing eastward to Cyzicus, he besieged the city with the assistance of Pharnabazus' army and took it by storm. The Athenians pursued him, and, in the waters off Cyzicus, enticed Mindarus into a fatal trap. While Thrasybulus and Theramenes waited out of sight with a number of triremes, Alcibiades took forty ships and showed himself before Cyzicus. Mindarus took the bait, setting out with his entire fleet in pursuit. When he was sufficiently far from shore, the hidden Athenian forces emerged to cut off his line of retreat. Surrounded, Mindarus led his ships in a desperate flight towards a beach south-west of the city, the one direction open to him. Landing with Alcibiades' force hot on their heels, Mindarus' men, and Pharnabazus' troops who had come up to support them, fought to prevent the Athenians from towing their ships out to sea. Initially, the Athenians were driven back, but Thrasybulus and Theramenes, bringing up their forces and the Athenian land forces from the rear, were eventually able to drive the Persians off. Undaunted, Mindarus divided his force to face the threat now pressing from both sides, but when he fell in the fighting, Peloponnesian resistance dissolved; all the fleet's ships were either destroyed or captured.For the battle, see Diodorus Siculus, Library 13.49-51 and Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 410-13. In the wake of this resounding defeat, Mindarus' name was immortalized in one of the most famous examples of laconic brevity: a dispatch from the Spartan survivors was intercepted by the Athenians. It read: \\"The ships are lost. Mindarus is dead. The men are starving. We wonder what is to be done.\\"Xenophon, Hellenica 1.1.23. NotesReferences *Diodorus Siculus, Library *Kagan, Donald.

He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1964 and was also selected in 1969 as the center on the NFL 1920s All-Decade Team. A native of Chicago, Trafton played college football for Knute Rockne's undefeated 1919 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team. He played professional football in the National Football League (NFL) as a center for the Decatur Staleys (1920), Chicago Staleys (1921), and Chicago Bears (1923‚Äì1932). He is credited as being the first center to snap the ball with one hand and was selected six times as a first-team All Pro. Trafton also competed as a boxer for a time. He also worked as an assistant football coach for Northwestern in 1922, the Green Bay Packers in 1944, and the Cleveland / Los Angeles Rams from 1945 to 1949. He was the head coach of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers from 1951 to 1953. He led the Blue Bombers to the 41st Grey Cup in 1953. Early years Trafton was born in 1896 in Chicago. He attended Oak Park High School, in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park. He played football for Oak Park from 1913 to 1915. At age 22, Trafton played college football for one year at the University of Notre Dame. He was a member of Knute Rockne's 1919 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team that featured George Gipp, compiled a perfect 9‚Äì0 record, outscored opponents 229 to 47, and was recognized as a co-national champion by the National Championship Foundation and Parke H. Davis. Trafton also played for the Notre Dame basketball team during the 1920-1921 season. Professional football player=Staleys In early July 1920, Trafton signed to play for the Decatur Staleys in the inaugural season of the National Football League (known that year as the American Professional Football Association). Trafton appeared in all 13 games for the 1920 Staleys team that compiled a 10‚Äì1‚Äì2 record and finished in second place in the new league. At the end of the 1920 season, Trafton was selected as a first-team All Pro. The 1920 Staleys included three players who were later inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame: Trafton, George Halas, and Jimmy Conzelman. In June 1921, Trafton returned to the Staleys, working in A. E. Staley's starch plant during the summer. The 1921 Staleys compiled a 9‚Äì1‚Äì1 and won the first NFL championship in the history of the Chicago Bears franchise (the Staleys were renamed the Bears in 1922). Northwestern In 1922, Trafton took leave from professional football to serve as an assistant football coach, with responsibility for the linemen, for Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. The 1922 Northwestern Purple football team compiled a 3‚Äì3‚Äì1, and went 1‚Äì3‚Äì1 against Big Ten Conference opponents. In February 1923, Trafton was forced to resign his coaching job due to a ruling from the Big Ten Conference prohibiting former professional players to coach in any capacity for a conference team. Northwestern's athletic director, Dana Evans, said at the time that he accepted the resignation with reluctance and called Trafton \\"one of the best line coaches in the conference and a large factor in developing the 1922 Purple eleven.\\" Bears In September 1923, Trafton returned to the NFL as a player with the Chicago Bears. He continued playing with the Bears through the 1932 season. During Trafton's tenure with the Bears, the Staleys/Bears won NFL championships in 1921 and 1932, and Trafton was selected six times as a first- team All Pro (1920, 1923‚Äì1927). According to his biography at the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he \\"was one of the first centers to rove on defense and the very first on offense to center the football with only one hand.\\" Trafton also became known as one of the roughest players in the earliest years of the NFL. Red Grange called Trafton the \\"meanest, toughest player alive.\\" Grange claimed it was a tackle by Trafton, twisting Grange's knee while his cleats were stuck in the turf, that ended Grange's career. It was said of Trafton that he was strongly disliked in every NFL city except Green Bay and Rock Island where \\"he was hated.\\" During a game against Rock Island, he reportedly knocked unconscious four Rock Island players over a span of only 12 plays, knocked a Rock Island halfback into a fence, and was chased from the city after the game under a barrage of thrown objects. Boxing In addition to his football career, Trafton also had a long association with the sport of boxing, as a boxer in 1929 and 1930, and thereafter as a boxing manager and gymnasium operator. Boxer Trafton's first boxing match of note was a December 1929 bout against Chicago White Sox first baseman Art Shires. Trafton won by decision after five rounds. Sports writer Charles Dunkley later called it a legendary bout \\"which was as vicious and spectacular as it was hilarious.\\" He fought three more bouts in January and February 1930, winning two of those matches by knockout and a third by disqualification. On March 26, 1930, Trafton faced future world champion Primo Carnera in Kansas City. Trafton was knocked out by Carnera in the first round of their fight. In the aftermath of the fight, Trafton was suspended indefinitely by the Missouri Boxing Commission for failing to provide more resistance in the 54-second bout. Manager and gymnasium owner After retiring from professional football, Trafton operated a boxing gymnasium at 180 West Randolph Street in Chicago in the 1930s and early 1940s. He also served as a manager for boxers. The boxers he managed included light welterweight Willie Joyce who was the 1936 National AAU bantamweight champion, and the 1937 (126 lb) Chicago & Intercity Golden Gloves Champion. Professional football coach=Green Bay Packers In June 1944, Trafton was hired as an assistant coach with the Green Bay Packers and put in charge of the team's linemen. Working with head coach Curly Lambeau, Trafton helped lead the 1944 Packers to an 8‚Äì2 record and the NFL championship. Despite the team's success, Trafton was released by the Packers in January 1945. Cleveland / Los Angeles Rams In May 1945, Trafton was hired by the Cleveland Rams as the team's line coach. He remained the Rams' line coach when they moved to Los Angeles in 1946 and through the 1949 season. In 1950, he moved to a position in the Rams' front office as promotions director. Winnipeg Blue Bombers In May 1951, Trafton signed a one-year contract as the head coach of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. Trafton led the 1951 Blue Bombers to an 8-6 record and a third-place finish out of four teams in the Western Interprovincial Football Union. Trafton remained with the Blue Bombers in 1952 and led the club to a 12‚Äì3‚Äì1, though the team lost to Edmonton in the WIFU Finals. In his third and final season with Winnipeg, he led the 1953 Blue Bombers to an 8‚Äì8 record and led the club to the 41st Grey Cup game, which it lost by a 12‚Äì6 score against Hamilton. Two weeks after Winnipeg's loss in the Grey Cup game, Trafton was fired in December 1953. He announced his retirement from coaching in January 1954. Family, later years, and honors Trafton was married on multiple occasions. He was first married to Suzanne Kellington of Decatur, Illinois, in December 1923. In March 1926, Trafton divorced his first wife on grounds that she deserted him two months after their marriage. In June 1929, he was married for a second time to Alyce. In April 1931, Trafton sued for divorce on grounds of extreme cruelty; he alleged that she hit him over the head with a ginger ale bottle, threw a chair at him, attempted to kill him with a carving knife, kicked him in the stomach, and frequently clawed him. In her answer, Trafton's wife accused him of being a gigolo at a Chicago hotel and breaking her nose. The divorce was granted in June 1931. In December 1932, Trafton was married for a third time to Helen Lowenstein. Trafton and his third wife had two children, a daughter (Bliss) born in 1944 and a son (George, Jr.) born in 1949. He was divorced again in 1950. He later married to a fourth wife, Jacqueline. After retiring from coaching, Trafton returned to Los Angeles where he worked in the real estate and property management business. During his retirement, Trafton received numerous honors for his contributions to the sport of football. These honors include the following: * In 1950, Trafton was among 25 professional football players inducted in the Helms Athletic Foundation Hall of Fame. * In 1964, Trafton was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of its second class of inductees. * In 1969, Trafton was selected by the Pro Football Hall of Fame as the center on the NFL 1920s All-Decade Team. Trafton underwent \\"major hip surgery\\" in April 1971 and was then sent to the Villa Gardens Convalescent Home in Los Angeles. He died in September 1971 at West Los Angeles Hospital at age 74. A friend noted at the time, \\"George just plain wore out.\\" Trafton's funeral service was held in Los Angeles with pall bearers including former teammates and Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees George Halas, Ed Healey, and Link Lyman.

It is one of the new towns that were developed by the Hong Kong Government in the New Territories from the 1960s. It was built around the existing rural local centre of Tuen Mun ( Castle Peak). The town is currently regulated by the Tuen Mun Outline Zoning Plan. Land leases in this area were known as Tuen Mun Town Lot ‚Ññ foo. The new town covers most of the urban area of Tuen Mun District. Another new town, Hung Shui Kiu, which is located partially in Tuen Mun District, is currently under development. History The initial plan for Tuen Mun New Town can be traced to a report by consulting firm Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick & Partners in 1959. At that time the project was known as Castle Peak. The history of settlement in Tuen Mun can be traced back 6,000 years. The area was part of a larger region which was leased from the Qing Empire to the British Empire in 1898 for 99 years as part of the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory. The colonial government, faced with overcrowding resulting from large numbers of immigrants from China as well as natural increase, embarked on various new towns projects to create large housing developments to house the rapidly growing population. Construction of the new town started in 1966. In the next year, the government reclaiming of land near an area known as \\"Tuen Mun San Hui\\" (). San Hui was considered as a market township of the area at that time, which was a market centre for the surrounding area. Further reclamation was carried out in Castle Peak Bay, among others, until the late 1960s. The government also levelled the hillside area to obtain land for the town during that period. J. M. Wigglesworth, a senior planning officer of the government, has stated that choosing coastal sites is partially due to land tenure rights in the New Territories. Thus the government preferred land reclamation. In 1973, the new town project was renamed Tuen Mun New Town. Rumour has it that the town was renamed because Castle Peak was more famous for a psychiatric hospital which was named after the area. The major construction works, such as land reclamation, underground drainage, electricity infrastructure, and roads were completed in 1974. However, the last sale of the land lease of the new town by the government won't carried out until 2019. The first public housing estate of the new town was San Fat Estate. It was completed in 1971. Geography Tuen Mun New Town, as of 1971, was by road and by sea from Kowloon. There was little chance of flood at that time. The new town is situation in the valley between Castle Peak and Tai Lam hill (should be Kau Keng Shan). Before the development, it was a major fishing port with a land-based population of 22,500 people. Studies suggested that the area should be developed into a satellite city of 1 million population. As of 2011 census, whole Tuen Mun District, which covers Tuen Mun New Town and other urban and rural areas, had a population of 487,546 people.https://www.census2011.gov.hk/en/district-profiles.html Design The development model is constructed around a town centre. The town is also served by multiple lines of the Light Rail. According to the early draft of the new town, the settlement was designed to have land allocated for industrial use, which would provide employment to residents, however this did not eventuate. As Hong Kong transformed into a service-oriented economy, only 30% of residents in the western New Territories (including the Tuen Mun, Yuen Long, and Tin Shui Wai New Towns) worked locally, according to 2011 census. In 2019, some industrial buildings of the new town applied to be rezoned for commercial use. However, it was also reported that due to the opening of the Hong Kong‚ÄìZhuhai‚ÄìMacau Bridge, some industrial buildings were rented by logistic companies in 2018. A number of logistics companies also expressed interest in land leases near the River Trade Terminal in 2018. The road infrastructure of the town to other areas of Hong Kong relies on Tuen Mun Road and Castle Peak Road, as well as roads to northern Yuen Long District. Until the opening of the West Rail in 2003, local residents suffered from traffic congestion on Tuen Mun Road and Castle Peak Road. However, as of 2019, the railway line also reached its capacity and the government had planned new road to connect the town to the CBD via Lantau Tomorrow Vision. Tuen Mun‚ÄìChek Lap Kok Link is under construction. Tuen Mun Ferry Pier serves as the pier for the town to connect to Mainland China, and Macau, as well as local destinations such as Lantau Island. In the past it also had scheduled ferries to Hong Kong Island. The boundary and land uses of the town are still regulated by Tuen Mun Outline Zoning Plan. The government still periodically updates the plan. The first plan was approved by Governor-in-Council in 1967. As of 2018, the statutory boundaries of the town are \\"the ridges of Castle Peak to the west, Lam Tei Interchange of Castle Peak Road to the north, and Tai Lam Country Park to the east. To the southeast the area extends to Siu Lam Interchange of Tuen Mun Road, while to the southwest it extends to Tap Shek Kok.\\" In 2017, the local council rejected the government's plan to convert some land from \\"government, institution and community\\" use or \\"open space\\" to residential. Tuen Mun town centre The town centre was designed to have public library, education centre, theatre, convention and exhibition hall, arts museum, as well as government building that connects to commercial buildings, which house supermarkets, banks and other shops that provide daily needs. In a history book edited by Lau Chi-pang () and Liu Shuyong (), they give a positive review on the town planning, which they describe the Tuen Mun town centre is the \\"centre of gravity\\" () of the town: In 1971, the section of the town that encompassing the existing market town San Hui was considered as the most- valuable land for high-rise private residential use. These residential area are designated as Tuen Mun Area 10, 11 and 13 in the OZP, which they are bordering one to another. Area 11 also accommodated the planned town centre. Tuen Mun Area 34, due west to Area 11 and 13, was designed to be an open space. Area 34 is now known as Tuen Mun Park.https://www.ozp.tpb.gov.hk News reports also consider residential blocks of the , Kam Wah Garden, Tuen Mun Town Plaza and are the four major residential estates of the town centre. In urban zoning, they were located at the aforementioned Area 11, as well as on a small strip of Area 37 of the Tuen Mun OZP. Another private residential estate, Tuen Mun Centre (), is situated at Area 10, which also marked as the site of the San Hui. Another land lease, Tuen Mun Town Lot ‚Ññ513, which was sold by the government in 2014, was also considered as next to the town centre and the railway station by the real estate critics. Nowadays, near to the Tuen Mun railway station, are Tuen Mun Town Hall, Tuen Mun Public Library, Tuen Mun Clinic, Tuen Mun Government Offices, Tuen Mun Law Courts, Tuen Mun Park, as well as shopping centres such as V City, The Trend Plaza Shopping Arcade, Tuen Mun Town Plaza shopping centre, as well as pentahotel Tuen Mun, etc. Those public facilities were mostly located in Area 11 as well as Area 37, while the V City and its associated residential blocks, are located in Area 10. The railway station itself is located above the river, which divides Area 10 to Area 9. Politics Some constituencies of the Tuen Mun District Council serve the new town, although the boundaries of the constituencies differ from the boundaries of the urban planning OZP. The executive branch of the district-level government, the Tuen Mun District Office of the Home Affairs Department, is located on the second floor of Tuen Mun Government Offices, a building located within the new town at 1 Tuen Hi Road.

They formed in Melbourne in 1977 and were led by Philip Brophy. The group performed music, produced artwork, films, videos, live theatre, multi-media, and wrote literature.Philip Brophy , 22 Contemporary Australian Composers History The Melbourne suburb of Clifton Hill's Community Music Centre, an artist run space focused on the performance of new sound art and experimental music, was the base for Philip Brophy's project, ‚Üí ‚Üë ‚Üí. Sometimes compared to Andy Warhol's Factory collective, the group provided experimental music (Brophy on drums or synthesiser), films, videos, and live theatrical performances exploring his aesthetic and cultural interests, often on a minimal budget. ‚Üí ‚Üë ‚Üí were often seen as working with Roland Barthes theory of The Death of The Author. They were primarily interested in demystifying creative practices and analysing cultural phenomenons, stripping them down to their most basic defining characteristics. Musically the group touched upon a wide range of experimental styles including minimalism, punk rock, muzak, krautrock and disco, usually with no vocalist,McFarlane 'Philip Brophy' entry. Retrieved 7 March 2010.Spencer et al, (2007) TCH TCH TCH/ TSK TSK TSK entry. Retrieved 7 March 2010. which frustrated countless music audiences.Anonymous untitled review. July 17, 1980. in Brophy (ed.). Made by ‚Üí ‚Üë ‚Üí. Melbourne: self-published, 1983. pg. 39. Although they were regularly performing and presenting music and performances in art spaces like the Clifton Hill Community Music Centre and even the National Gallery of Victoria, ‚Üí ‚Üë ‚Üí frequently played with post-punk and new wave bands, including The Boys Next Door at pubs like the Crystal Ballroom in St. Kilda to non-art audiences. Over the project's operation it involved over sixty of Brophy's friends in variable line-ups that included musician David Chesworth from Essendon Airport, a post-punk band who explored similar experimental music forms,Spencer et al, (2007) ESSENDON AIRPORT entry. Retrieved 8 March 2010. on synthesiser, and visual artists Maria Kozic and Jayne Stevenson both on synthesiser. The group grew to notable popularity in the early-mid 1980s, being asked to participate in a range of large scale Australian exhibitions, including Paul Taylor‚Äôs Popism at the National Gallery of Victoria in 1982, the 1982 Biennale of Sydney, and the Art Gallery of New South Wales art festival Perspecta in 1983. Artistically, they were closely linked to Paul Taylor, the artists in his Popism exhibition including Juan Davila, Howard Arkley and Jenny Watson, and Taylor‚Äôs journal Art & Text to which Brophy contributed. Crossover between this art scene with the Melbourne post-punk and new wave can be seen in both Arkley and Watson painting of images of Nick Cave, but also in Art & Text publishing articles about music subcultures, Taylor even using current music terms to describe these young visual artists as the ‚ÄúAustralian New Wave‚Äù. ‚Üí ‚Üë ‚Üí crossed both though, appearing in exhibitions with the aforementioned artists but also performing frequently with groups like The Boys Next Door and including them in gigs they organised such as Punk Gunk where they performed their work/band ‚ÄúPunk Band‚Äù. The band performed or exhibited in Europe, including London's Institute of Contemporary Arts and Paris' Museum of Modern Art. In 1983 Brophy produced a retrospective book, Made by ‚Üí ‚Üë ‚Üí, which is co-credited to ‚Üí ‚Üë ‚Üí. He dissolved the project shortly after the 1986 European tour of Stills, and continued to work with, his then partner, Kozic for some time, prior to her relocation to New York City. Asphixiation: What is This Thing Called 'Disco'? This work first appeared as a performance and installation by ‚Üí ‚Üë ‚Üí in 1980 at the George Paton Gallery called Asphixiation: What is This Thing Called ‚ÄòDisco‚Äô?. It featured large screen printed reproductions of fashion magazines and several plinths with instruments, tape players and hanging frames, all lit with neon. The performance involved the group miming to a disco album they made, the reel-to-reel visibly playing, and was recorded by David Chesworth from Essendon Airport, the album itself written in five days. An executive from Missing Link Records saw this show and approached the group about doing a single, to see if it would be a breakthrough hit like they had the previous year with The Flying Lizards ‚ÄúMoney‚Äù. If this was successful they would put out the whole album. The single was for the song ‚ÄúL‚ÄôAcrostique D‚ÄôAmour‚Äù with the b-side ‚ÄúThe Crush‚Äù and was released under the name Asphixiation. Seemingly the records did not sell enough, so the album was released on Philip Brophy and Chesworth's label Innocent, with the single repressed by Innocent and packaged with the album. The project was focused on what Brophy saw as a phenomenon of disco being used to market a whole range of consumer products, tied to its ongoing commercialisation in mainstream music.  Legacy  The music of ‚Üí ‚Üë ‚Üí has appeared on various compilations from the 2000s into the 2010s which look at underground Australian new wave music. ‚Üí ‚Üë ‚Üí and Asphixiation appear on both of Chapter Music‚Äôs Can‚Äôt Stop It! compilations. Andras Fox and Instant Peterson made a compilation titled Midnite Spares in 2016 of ‚Äúoverlooked avant-pop and electronic works‚Äù released on Efficient Space, an offshoot label of Noise in My Head. The record included ‚ÄúSedation‚Äù as well as a later song by Maria Kozic and The MK Sound, the MK Sound being Philip Brophy, both members of ‚Üí ‚Üë ‚Üí, called ‚ÄúTrust Me‚Äô. Chapter Music Reissued the Asphixiation album What is Thing Thing Called ‚ÄòDisco‚Äô? in July 2017, along with the additional single it originally came with, as well as new liner notes and photographs. In the context of art, ‚Üí ‚Üë ‚Üí were included in the National Gallery of Victoria‚Äôs 2013 exhibition Mix Tape 1980s: Appropriation, Subculture, Critical Style which used a lot of material from Paul Taylor‚Äôs 1982 Popism exhibition. It also included several albums available to listen to, including Asphixiation's What is This Thing Called ‚ÄòDisco‚Äô?. Members ‚Üí ‚Üë ‚Üí was a fluid project with little stability in the line-ups.

She is described as having light brown hair prone to sun-streaks, bright corn-flower blue eyes and an unusually small button nose. She is described as very pretty in Magic Steps by Pasco Acalon, her student, and in The Will of the Empress by her suitors Fin and Jak. Background Sandrilene fa Toren is a girl of noble birth. Her mother and father were killed in a smallpox epidemic before she is introduced in Sandry's Book. Her father was Baron Mattin fer Toren, her mother Clehame Amiliane fa Landreg (equivalent to a Countess). She is the great-niece of Vedris IV, duke of Emelan and some speculate that he may change his will to make Sandry his heir instead of his third son (and Sandry's cousin) Franzen. She is also cousin to the Empress Berenene of the Namorn Empire. Until The Will of the Empress, her Namornese estates are run by her cousin, Saghad Ambros fer Landreg. Sandry matures as the books go on, but still tends to be a bit 'uppity' about certain things. In The Will of the Empress, we see a potential romantic interest in the form of Pershan fer Roth (Shan), but that is later dispelled when Sandry finds out that he is the Empress' current lover. Though she claims to dislike flirting, and be opposed to the idea of marriage, Sandry's infatuation with Shan is clear. Of all her suitors in the Will of the Empress, Jak is the one she likes most, but only as a friend. Sandry also is afraid of the dark, she always carries a rough clear rock as her nightlight, that Tris, Daja, and Briar made that gives out light. Because she comes from noble family, Sandry is somewhat na√Øve. However, through the series she is shown as a very loyal friend, and does not judge people by their place in society. She has a very strong sense of justice and obligation. Briar mentions her as one of the bravest people he knows, and describes her as a great listener. Daja has commented that she 'has too good of a heart.' When first introduced, Sandry was the only one who wanted to befriend everybody, and during The Will of the Empress, she is the only one of the four to want to \\"reforge\\" their circle. Magic=Thread magic Since childhood, Sandry has always wanted to learn how to spin and weave, but because of her social status, both crafts are considered unseemly. Instead, Sandry spent many hours embroidering, to the point where she was scolded for doing it too much and damaging the skin of her hands. During the smallpox epidemic that killed her parents, she was locked in a small room to keep her safe from rioters. When she ran out of light she realized that she is capable of braiding light into silk threads. She was found and rescued by Niklaren Goldeye (Niko), a powerful mage, and taken to Discipline Cottage of Winding Circle where she meets three other children with magical abilities. Together, they learn how to control and use their unusual magic. Spinning pure magic When an unexpected earthquake trapped Sandry and her three companions in a cave, their individual magics, although powerful, could not reach far enough to protect them. In an act of desperation, Sandry spun the fibers of their power into an abstract thread, using the first corporeal thread she'd ever spun as an anchor for the working. The working causes their magic to mingle and leak into each other, a process only halted when, in Daja's Book, Sandry weaves a cloth map of their respective powers, with dividers blocking them from leaking any further. According to Dedicate Lark, her teacher, Sandry is the only mage known to have spun pure magic. She does this again in Magic Steps, when encountering a young Unmage embroiled in a war between two organized crime families. This time, the rope of Unmagic is knotted into a web similar to a fishing net, and Pasco performs a summoning charm on it designed to trap the Unmage and his handlers. The Unmage and the assassins are literally torn to pieces by this net when Sandry uses it to rip the Unmagic from their bodies.  Credential  In The Circle Opens quartet, it is mentioned that all four of the ambient mages received a mage's credential that most mages would receive in their late twenties after mastering their power. These young mages had mastered their powers when they were 13. In the book Magic Steps, it does not mention what image is on her medallion. Student In Magic Steps, Sandry discovers Pasco Acalon, a twelve-year-old boy with rare dancing magic. She becomes his magic teacher as Yazm√¨n Hebet, a famous dancer, becomes his dance instructor. Pasco comes from two powerful \\"harrier\\", or police, families. He is expected to become a harrier like his parents, grandparents and other relations all of whom disapprove of his interest in dancing. He proves himself worthy of dancing by using his magic to help capture some magical murderers. In Magic Steps, he develops his own spell which makes him \\"invisible\\" by causing others to simply not notice his presence.

The current building occupied a seafront location until 2007, since when reclamation works have led to it becoming inland. As of 2018, the building is scheduled for demolition, although there are efforts to preserve it as a historical landmark. Past locations General Post Office, c. 1923 Des Voeux Road Central and Pedder Street in Central, 1911 View from Victoria Harbour in the 1920s. The General Post Office is the third building from right, at the corner with Pedder Street. The pier in front is Blake Pier. The GPO has been moved three times after several reclamations as it was essential to locate the office near the shore for receiving letters from ocean liners. Past locations of the GPO were: * 1841‚Äì1846: Above St. John's Cathedral, Garden Road (current Former Central Government Offices) * 1846‚Äì1911: Queen's Road Central, opposite D'Aguilar Street * 1911‚Äì1976: Junction of Des Voeux Road Central and Pedder Street (rebuilt into World-Wide House) * 1976‚Äìpresent: 2 Connaught Place, Central 1846 GPO In 1846 premises which had belonged to Dent & Co. were transformed into Government Treasury (), Supreme Court and General Post Office.

The resulting China Building () was completed in 1924.Feature: Buildings for Pedder Street since colonialisation , Sing Pao, 29 October 2005 1911 GPO Reclamations had taken place in the meantime in the late 1890s, and the first General Post Office was relocated in 1911 into new premises on the newly reclaimed section of Pedder Street. It was a typical Edwardian municipal construction of granite and red brick, and was known as \\"the Old Lady of Pedder Street\\".Eric Cavaliero, Pedder Street was where it all happened, The Standard, 13 August 1998 This old General Post Office building was demolished in 1976, and was functionally relocated to Connaught Place to make way for the construction of the Central station of the MTR below ground. Below the building is the interchange of Hong Kong Station and Central Station of MTR. World-Wide House, an office block, was constructed above ground. Joseph Ting, former chief curator of the Hong Kong Museum of History, regarded the 1911 General Post Office as Hong Kong's most beautiful building. 1976 GPO The building was constructed on reclaimed land. In 1967, the Government had planned for a 30-storey block, with 5 floors for the GPO, and 25 for government offices. The site directly to its south was secured by Hongkong Land at a record price. In exchange, the Government was obliged to accede to a stipulation that no building directly to the north of Connaught Centre, now Jardine House, would obstruct its views, thus the maximum height of the GPO building was limited to 120 feet. The GPO was designed by architect K. M. Tseng, as a 5-storey building, and the foundation to support another 2, up to the maximum permitted height of 120 feet. The building houses the first central vacuum-cleaning system in Hong Kong, without the need to change bags.

Gayle Village from Bence Gayle was originally a farming settlement but the population grew during the late 18th century to around 350 with employment in local quarries, coal-mining in Sleddale and in a water-driven cotton mill on Gayle Beck. The population of the village later contracted. Gayle Mill, constructed in 1776, is now a Grade II* listed building, a scheduled monument and came third in the BBC's 2004 Restoration contest. Originally a cotton-spinning mill it was converted to a sawmill in 1878. It is the oldest structurally unaltered cotton mill in existence, and its Thomson Double-Vortex turbine built by Williamson's of Kendal in 1878 is believed to be the world's oldest surviving water turbine still in its original situation. The mill has been restored and is now open to the public. Gayle has a Methodist Church, constructed in 1833. A breakaway Methodist sect, associated with the Sandemanians in Scotland, was previously associated with the village, but only their graveyard remains. Gayle relies primarily on farming and tourism, with the area boasting campsites and bed-and-breakfasts, as well as being a popular location for holiday homes.

The Austrians, though outnumbered, fought hard until Napoleon arrived, when the battle subsequently became a clear French victory. Prelude There were in fact two engagements at Landshut. The first occurred on 16 April when Hiller pushed a defending Bavarian division out of the town. Five days later, after the French victory at Abensberg, the left wing of the Austrian army (36,000 men) withdrew on Landshut (this force was once more led by Hiller). Napoleon believed that this was the main Austrian army and ordered Lannes to pursue the enemy. Lannes‚Äôs troops caught up with Hiller on the twenty-first. Hiller had decided to defend Landshut to allow his baggage train to withdraw. At Landshut the Isar river was spanned by two bridges with a small island in the center. Hiller had positioned cavalry outposts to the north of the town. His main force was deployed in Landshut and to the south on higher ground. Early in the morning Hiller was informed that a French force (57,000 men) had crossed the Isar upstream at Moosburg. Mass√©na led this force.Ralph Baker in The Encyclopedia of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars by Gregory Fremont-Barnes (main editor) (Santa Barbara: ABC- CLIO, 2006) 546-547. The battle Hiller realized that he would be unable to hold his position for long, as Mass√©na was trying to block him from escaping. At this point his cavalry were forced back by Lannes‚Äôs troops and the Austrians were pushed back into Landshut. The French now quickly seized the northern bridge over the river, and the Austrians withdrew into the main part of the town to defend the southern bridge. The Austrians tried to set fire to this second bridge, but owing to the rainfall over the previous days, this was only partially successful. However the Austrians did manage to close the gates at the end of the bridge. The French were now faced with attacking across the smoldering bridge. Napoleon ordered his aide General Georges Mouton (later comte de Lobau) to assume command of the attacking grenadiers of the 17th Line. In the face of heavy Austrian fire from all sides, Mouton ordered his men to attack without firing their muskets. The grenadiers reached the gateway and broke it down, allowing Bavarian troops to quickly reinforce the breach. The fighting now continued in the streets of Landshut itself. However the French had crossed a bridge immediately to the west of the town and were now entering Landshut from the south. Consequences Many of the defenders were captured, but Hiller was able to retreat with the bulk of his force toward Neumarkt am Wallersee. Landshut finally fell to the French just after noon. The Austrian force had suffered around 10,000 casualties as well as losing 30 cannon, but more importantly they had lost many caissons, a pontoon train, and thousands of supply wagons. The victorious French forces spent much of the afternoon ransacking these supplies.

Biography Born on a farm near Stromsburg, Nebraska, on May 12, 1878, Norton attended Bryant Normal University in Stromsburg. He graduated from Nebraska Wesleyan University in 1901 and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 1903. He served as clerk and recorder of Polk County, Nebraska, from 1906 to 1909, and served as mayor of Osceola, Nebraska, from 1908 to 1909. Norton moved to a farm near Polk, Nebraska and farmed from 1910 to 1922. He was a member of the Nebraska House of Representatives from 1911 to 1918. During this time he introduced a bill to establish a unicameral legislature; the effort failed at the time, but Norton continued to advocate for the idea for two decades until it was finally enacted. Norton was a member of the State Constitutional Convention in 1919 and 1920, and became a Chautauqua and Lyceum lecturer in 1922. He was the Democratic nominee for Governor of Nebraska in 1924, as the Democratic incumbent, Charles W. Bryan, was running for Vice President of the United States. Both Norton and Bryan lost, and Norton returned to lecturing, continuing in that line of work until 1927. In 1926, Norton was elected as a Democrat to the Seventieth Congress (March 4, 1927 ‚Äì March 3, 1929), unsuccessfully running for reelection in 1928. In 1930, he was elected to the Seventy-second Congress (March 4, 1931 ‚Äì March 3, 1933). He was defeated for renomination in 1932 by fellow incumbent Ashton C. Shallenberger, when the two were thrown together in redistricting following Nebraska's loss of one U.S. House seat in reapportionment. From June 1933 to December 1936, Norton was a representative and adviser to the Agricultural Adjustment Administration. During this time, Norton saw one of his chief political goals accomplished: in 1934 voters in Nebraska approved a constitutional amendment to take effect with the 1936 elections, abolishing the state House of Representatives and granting its powers to the state Senate, forming a unicameral legislature. (This was enacted with the help of U.S. Senator George W. Norris.) Norton was elected to the first \\"Unicameral\\" in 1936 and wrote the rules for the new governing body; he served one term in it, in 1937 and 1938. Norton became a special adviser in the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation in Washington, D.C., where he served from 1939 to 1948. He died in Washington, D.C. on October 5, 1960, and was buried in Swede Plain Cemetery in Polk County, Nebraska. Norton's daughter, Evelyn Lincoln, was President John F. Kennedy's personal secretary, serving him both in the Senate and in the White House, for nearly 11 years. She was riding in the motorcade in Dallas on November 22, 1963, when Kennedy was assassinated.

He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1991. Jones is credited as the first professional player to use weight training to improve his conditioning for football. Early life Jones was born in Altoona, Pennsylvania, but grew up in the Harrisburg area after his father, a telephone company employee, was transferred to that area. He then played football at Lemoyne High School in Lemoyne, Pennsylvania. He attended the University of Maryland, where he was a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity. College career Jones attended the University of Maryland, where he played college football as a tackle. He was a unanimous All-American selection in 1953. Jones was on some of the most successful Maryland teams. The Terps were co-champions with Virginia Military Institute in 1951 in the Southern Conference. In 1953, they played in the Atlantic Coast Conference and were co- champions with Duke University. That year, they were also named the national champions. Jones was awarded the Knute Rockne Memorial Trophy as the nation's outstanding lineman and the school awarded him the Anthony Nardo Award as the team's best lineman. He then played in the College All-Star Game against the Detroit Lions. Professional career Jones was drafted in the fifth round of the 1953 NFL Draft by the Chicago Bears and started in 1954 as an offensive tackle. In 1955, Jones switched to guard and, for the next eight seasons, was a fixture at that position and one of the NFL's most highly respected guards. When the Bears needed help on defense in 1962, assistant coach George Allen decided that Jones could help at defensive tackle. He played both ways in 1962 and then switched to defensive tackle permanently in 1963. After 1965, Bears coach George Halas agreed, as a favor to Jones, to trade him to the Washington Redskins so that he could play a final season near his home in Rockville, Maryland. He retired after the 1966 season. Jones missed only two games his first 11 seasons, was an All-Pro guard in 1955, 1956, 1959, and 1960, and played in seven straight Pro Bowls following the 1955 through 1961 seasons. He has also been credited as the first professional player to use weight training for football conditioning. Coaching career After playing football, Jones became an assistant coach for the Denver Broncos, Buffalo Bills, Cleveland Browns, and the New England Patriots. He later went back to work, this time as a defensive line coach for the Scottish Claymores of NFL Europe. During the mid-1950s Jones also worked in the off-season teaching physical education in the Montgomery County elementary schools. Honors Jones is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and College Football Hall of Fame. In 1977, he made the Atlantic Coast Conference 25-year team. Jones died on May 21, 2010 from complications of a stroke. He had a heart attack which triggered his death. Jones was also named to the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame.

The Zorin unit, led by Simcha-Shalom Zorin, included 800 Jews. The Germans invaded Minsk in late June 1941 and transferred the city's Jews, Zorin included, to a ghetto. Zorin worked in a local prisoner of war camp, where he met a captured Soviet officer named Semyon Ganzenko. In late 1941, Zorin and Ganzenko escaped to the forests in the Staroe Selo region, about 19 miles southwest of Minsk. While hiding in the forest, the two established a partisan unit called Parkhomenko. The unit consisted of 150 members, including many Jews. As more and more Jews joined the Parkhomenko unit, many conflicts arose between the Jewish and non-Jewish fighters. Zorin had about 100 fighters in his combat unit. Some were members of the Socialist-Zionist youth movement Hashomer Hatzair (\\"The Young Guard\\") who had escaped the Bia≈Ça Podlaska ghetto. In July 1944, Simcha Zorin was wounded in his leg during a battle with a retreating German unit; seven of his men were killed. In 1971, some 25 years after the war, Simcha Zorin emigrated to Israel.

In many cases it allows store personnel to preview and/or purchase merchandise before it is made available to the public. Typically, clients view the merchandise, place orders, and then wait for the vendor to manufacture and deliver the goods. If the merchandise has a designer, the vendor may choose to have the designer present at the event to add to the customers' experience. Prototypes, samples, remnants and leftover items from runway shows are also sometimes offered at trunk shows. Trunk shows may be open to the general public and advertised in the mass media or may be confined to special customers or those on a mailing list. The term is derived from the common practice of merchandise being transported to these events in trunks. Bridal industry Trunk shows are particularly popular from January to May in the bridal industry because the bride can view more designer's collections than in store. Online trunk shows Online or virtual trunk shows are gaining traction in the luxury sector. Bergdorf Goodman held its first virtual trunk show in 2010, and Salvatore Ferragamo launched its first online show in August 2011. Linda Fargo of Bergdorf's labeled virtual trunk shows \\"the future.\\" Retailers add behind-the-scenes footage and customers make online purchases, usually pre-season and at full price. Many trunk shows online allow pre-order with a deposit. Theatrical Performance A Trunk show may also refer to a very small theatrical performance.

Specifically, the Gang of Eight includes the leaders of each of the two parties from both the Senate and House of Representatives, and the chairs and ranking minority members of both the Senate Committee and House Committee for intelligence as set forth by . Under normal conditions, the President of the United States is required by Title to \\"ensure that the congressional intelligence committees are kept fully and currently informed of the intelligence activities of the United States, including any significant anticipated intelligence activity as required by [the] title.\\" However, under \\"extraordinary circumstances\\", when the President thinks \\"it is essential to limit access\\" to information about a covert action, 50 U.S.C. ¬ß 3093(c)(2) allows the President to limit reporting to the Gang of Eight. For a possible origin of the term \\"Gang of Eight\\" see Gang of Four. Background The term \\"Gang of Eight\\" gained wide currency in the coverage of the Bush administration's NSA warrantless surveillance controversy, in the context that no members of Congress other than the Gang of Eight were informed of the program, and they were forbidden to disseminate knowledge of the program to other members of Congress. The Bush administration asserted that the briefings delivered to the Gang of Eight sufficed to provide Congressional oversight of the program and preserve the checks and balances between the executive and legislative branches. The non-partisan Congressional Research Service prepared a legal analysis on January 18, 2006 that noted: \\"If the NSA surveillance program were to be considered an intelligence collection program, limiting congressional notification of the NSA program to the Gang of Eight, which some Members who were briefed about the program contend, would appear to be inconsistent with the law, which requires that the 'congressional intelligence committees be kept fully and currently informed of all intelligence activities', other than those involving covert actions.\\" However, as noted by David S. Kris, former Assistant Attorney General for National Security at DOJ: \\"As it turns out, however, Rep. Nadler was in fact aware of the bulk metadata collection in 2009, and (as discussed in the text) wrote to the Department of Justice about the collection at the time. In response, DOJ sent him a letter in December 2009 noting that the government was making available to all Members of Congress information about the bulk collection and compliance issues that had arisen.\\" In 2011, as it did in 2009, the Executive Branch again made documentation available to all members of Congress to explain reauthorization of Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. Senator Feinstein stressed in July 2013, \\"I know of no federal program for which audits, Congressional oversight and scrutiny by the Justice Department, the Intelligence Community and the Courts are stronger or more sustained.\\" Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales repeatedly made references to the \\"Gang of Eight\\" when being questioned about the warrantless surveillance/domestic spying while testifying at the Justice Department Oversight hearing held July 24, 2007.

Joe McManus was a pioneer in the field of Histochemistry during its period of expanding growth and application in the 1940s and 1950s. He was, furthermore, an exceptionally observant microscopist. The term he coined \\"Juxtaglomerular Complex\\" was used to denote the relationship of the renal tubular macula densa to the arteriolar granular cells. It was derived from his observations that the golgi of the distal tubular cells were reversed to a position beneath the nuclei in the macula densa and that the basement membrane between the macula densa and arteriolar cells was absent. His publications on glomerular obsolescence and late in his career on the dialysis kidney were based upon the same meticulous study of renal morphology. Education Dr. J.F.A. McManus was born in Blackville, New Brunswick, Canada on 13 July 1911. After graduating from Fordham University in 1933, he enrolled at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario where he received his MD degree in 1938 and where he also played on the university football team and boxed as a light heavyweight, winning an intercollegiate championship. After graduation from Queens he was accepted as the resident pathologist at Johns Hopkins University and the Cornell University-New York Hospital. He returned to Canada to enlist in the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps. Military service and early research From 1940 to 1945, McManus served in the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps. While he was stationed in England at Aldershot outside of Farnsborough at No.8 Canadian General Hospital, he met Professor J. R. Baker. It was in Baker's laboratory in the Department of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy at Oxford University, Dr. McManus developed a number of histochemical procedures including a Sudan black B procedure for demonstrating phospholipids. This work was to mark the beginning of his influence in identifying the chemistry of microscopic structure. In 1944, he joined the allied expeditionary force in the invasion of the continent with the British Liberation Army serving in field hospitals in Belgium and the Netherlands. Dr. Harold Taylor has pointed out that it was at this time that Joe's interest in fundamental biology became evident. Dr. Taylor happened to follow after McManus in three army hospitals, and in each he found that McManus had left a legacy: the best trained histology technicians Dr. Taylor had ever encountered. They had been painstakingly taught to use the McManus Periodic acid-Schiff stain to study normal kidneys, which led to his unique contributions on the nature of the juxtaglomerular complex. That anecdote probably illustrates better than any other the early promise of a distinguished scientific career. Where many other physicians had found laboratory work in the army a chore, McManus had made the very best use of the available resources. Many of the principles of histochemistry had been established before the outbreak of war, but developing and applying them to the physiologic and pathologic problems were mainly a post-World War II contribution to medical science. His honorable discharge carried the rank of Major and following the war, he returned to Professor Baker's department as a Beit Memorial Fellow. It was during this fellowship in 1946, the details of the Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reagent method for the staining of aldehyde components of mucosubstances were delineated. The impact of this staining procedure on the study of the kidney morphology is well known. Indeed, Dr. McManus' classic monograph on Medical Diseases of the Kidney is based upon the usefulness of the method. Academic career After leaving England in late 1946, Dr. McManus took up a position as Assistant Professor of Pathology first at the University of Alabama and then two years later in Virginia. In 1953 he returned to the U of A and he became Professor of Pathology for the next 8 years. It was there in collaboration with Robert Mowry, Charles Lupton and Sidney Kent, that the department became one of the best known medical centers for research and education. In 1960 he teamed with Dr. Robert Mowry to write Staining Methods; a handbook integrating newer histological and histochemical methods of tissue examination into standard laboratory procedures. After a one-year sabbatical in Oxford in 1960 working back at the same lab where he had made his earlier discovery, McManus accepted a teaching position at Indiana University. He was a pioneer in the combined M.D. / PhD. program there until 1965. Through this period, his work was pivotal to the development of a number of MD-PhD graduates, many of whom hold important academic positions today. While at Indiana he wrote The Fundamental Ideas of Medicine: a Brief History of Medicine. Written from a philosophical point of view, this text is still much sought after. This experience in medical' education also brought to fruition the publication of a textbook, General Pathology, in 1966. He became the President of the American Society of Experimental Pathologists in 1962-1963, the year of the Society's fiftieth anniversary. From 1965 to 1970, he served as the Executive Director of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology in Bethesda Maryland. His vision and enthusiastic leadership set the scene for a new phase of Federation affairs resulting in considerable growth in services to the scientific community. Next he was appointed to be the Dean of the Medical University of South Carolina. During his four-year tenure (1970‚Äì1974) as Dean of the Medical University of South Carolina, he provided the impetus for the establishment, with area hospital leaders, of a consortium of statewide hospitals for undergraduate and postgraduate medical education. He recruited an outstanding faculty with his own scholarship and academic achievements attracting many young investigators for whom he was a constant source of inspiration. Following the deanship, McManus returned to research at the Medical University of South Carolina, producing a detailed description of the histopathologic changes occurring in kidneys after long-term dialysis. Civil rights advocacy An ardent advocate for civil rights, during his tenure at the University of Alabama in the '50s, McManus frequently travelled down to Tuskegee University from Birmingham to lecture during a time when helping black academia was a sometimes precarious undertaking. He was also responsible for the hiring and training of the first black medical lab technicians at the Birmingham Hospital. During his tenure as Dean at the University of South Carolina McManus also established a minority admission program and hired an old friend, Dr. Middleton Lambright, as the Dean of Minority Students.

From The Canadian Medical Association Journal By Dr. Robert H. More Although an American citizen for many years, Joe McManus continued to visit his Canadian friends and attend many Canadian meetings in spite of the numerous demanding professional and scientific positions which he held for more than 3 decades. His continuing interest in Canada and his support and friendliness towards our scientists at meetings is a good reason for Canadians to remember him. To those of us who met him later in his career it was apparent that he showed the fearlessness of a fighter, regardless of the odds against him whenever it seemed important to state his opinion on controversial scientific, professional or political problems. As a distinguished alumnus he was constantly in touch with Queens University and participated in the scientific program held during the 100th anniversary of the Queen's University Medical School.

The name may be attributed to a line in the Isaac Watts hymn Alas! and Did My Saviour Bleed (Pub 1707) which says \\"Would he devote that sacred head for such a worm as I?\\" This thinking was prevalent in the days when this hymn was originally written, perhaps because there was also a higher view of God. Furthermore, worm theology can be attributed to a recognition of the ugliness of sin, resulting in contrition.  Origins  John Calvin (1509‚Äì1564) a 16th-century theologian and Protestant reformer much of his theological thinking was similar to Augustine of Hippo (354-430). Calvin saw the human race as being totally unable to do anything for itself to free itself from the stranglehold of sin, hence the reason why Jesus came to reveal what God the Father was really like (John 14:6) and that it is only through faith in Jesus and a continual yielding of self to the Holy Spirit that one is able to have an intimate relationship with a holy and righteous God. There are three passages in the Old Testament that ascribe the term \\"worm\\" to human beings: Isaiah 41:14, Job 25:4-6, and Psalm 22:6.

It was garrisoned between 1683 and 1701. The city of St. Ignace developed at the site, which also had the historic St. Ignace Mission founded by Jesuits. The fort was named after New France's governor at the time, Louis de Buade de Frontenac. Mission The French-Canadian settlement at St. Ignace began with the Mission of Saint Ignace, founded by Father Jacques Marquette, S.J. in 1671. By 1680 it had become a considerable community consisting of the mission, a French village of a dozen cabins, a Wyandot (Huron) Indian village surrounded by a wooden palisade and an adjacent Odawa (Ottawa) village, also behind a palisade. In 1681, the Huron and Illiniwek at St. Ignace killed the Seneca chief Annanhac, who had been leading his forces against the western peoples. The Seneca were part of the Iroquois Confederacy based in present-day New York state. Sharp practice by the fur traders also caused tensions. In 1683, Governor Joseph-Antoine de La Barre ordered Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut and Olivier Morel de La Durantaye to establish a strategic presence on the north shore of the Straits of Mackinac, connecting Lake Michigan and Lake Huron of the Great Lakes. They fortified the Jesuit mission and La Durantaye settled in as overall commander of the French forts in the northwest: Fort Saint Louis des Illinois (Utica, Illinois); Fort Kaministigoya (Thunder Bay, Ontario); and Fort la Tourette (Lake Nipigon, Ontario). He was also responsible for the region around Green Bay in present- day Wisconsin. In the spring of 1684, La Durantaye led a relief expedition from Saint Ignace to Fort Saint Louis des Illinois, which had been besieged by the Seneca as part of the Beaver Wars as they sought to gain more hunting ground to control the lucrative fur trade. That summer, and again in 1687, La Durantaye led coureurs de bois and Indians from the Straits against the Seneca homeland in upstate New York. During these years, English traders from New York entered the Great Lakes and traded at Michilimackinac. This, and the outbreak of war between England and France in 1689, led to the construction of Fort de Buade in 1690 by the new commandant Louis de La Porte de Louvign√©. Forts=Fort de Buade at St. Ignace During the 1690s, the fort became a staging area for French and Indian attacks against the Seneca, who were then allied to the English. It remained an important fur trading center and a distribution point for arms and munitions for the war against the Iroquois. In 1694 Governor Louis de Buade de Frontenac sent an aggressive young prot√©g√©, Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, to run the post. Cadillac made a small fortune as the post commander, possibly by collecting bribes. In 1697, the Huron chief Kondiaronk from Michilimackinac led an attack on the Seneca at Lake Erie. He gained a crushing victory and dashed the Seneca hopes for victory against the French. Four years later, Kondiaronk took a leading role in forging the Great Peace of Montreal, which would conclude the war. Relations between the fort and the adjacent Jesuit mission were not good during Cadillac's tenure. La Durantaye had ruled Michilimackinac with a firm hand. He controlled the trade in brandy, policed the fur trade, and kept the traders in line. An honest man, he would spend the last years of his life in relative poverty. Cadillac did not hold to these standards. He brought in for sale much of the alcohol at the post. The missionaries, led by Etienne de Carheil, accused Cadillac of encouraging the sale and trading of brandy to the Native Americans. Cadillac may have seen this move as a necessary tactic to check the English traders. In any case, he used it as a tactic in his own financial plans. Despite Cadillac's liquor trade, Anglo-French commercial competition continued. Cadillac was replaced as commandant by Alphonse Tonti, brother of the explorer Henri de Tonti. In 1701, Cadillac asked permission from Paris to found a new post on the Detroit River, to interdict the flow of British trade goods into the Lake Huron area. In that sense, the Fort de Buade garrison was related to development of the future city of Detroit. The final fate of Fort de Buade is unclear. After the withdrawal of the garrison, coureurs de bois continued to frequent Michilimackinac. Governor Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil used these traders to smuggle goods to the northern nations during the War of the Spanish Succession, despite the objections of J√©r√¥me Ph√©lypeaux, comte de Pontchartrain. Among his agents was the voyageur Daniel Amiot de Villeneuve. Unless the fort was destroyed when the garrison was evacuated, Vaudreuil's men likely used it to store goods intended for the Indians, until the new fort was completed on the south side of the Straits (1715). After this date few French remained at East Moran Bay. The fort was either destroyed or fell into disrepair and eventually disappeared. The 1690-1701 Fort de Buade was probably built as a wooden stockade. It is believed to have been located on a site within the current municipality of St. Ignace, possibly on a hill above East Moran Bay locally called \\"Fort Hill.\\" The fort could also have been located on the bay's waterfront. the fort's remains had not yet been found. Successor fort near Mackinaw City Between 1701 and 1715 there was no official French- Canadian presence at the Straits of Mackinac. Unlicensed fur trading by coureurs des bois no doubt continued during this period. In 1715 a French detachment under Constant le Marchand de Lignery re-established a presence at the Straits of Mackinac to prepare for war against the Fox nation in Wisconsin (Fox Wars). The new post, called Fort Michilimackinac, was built on the south shore of the Straits. Present-day Mackinaw City, Michigan developed near it. Most of the Huron migrated south to Detroit with Cadillac in 1701. The Ottawa moved from East Moran Bay to the new fort, and the St. Ignace area was largely abandoned until the nineteenth century.

It champions the Texans' efforts against Mexico to establish an independent republic. Tex Ritter first released the song as the b-side of \\"Gunsmoke\\" in 1955. It was the first song in the catalogue of his and Johnny Bond's music company Vidor Publications. Ritter's recording was used in the film Down Liberty Road the following year. While the song was never a hit single and did not initially make a big impact on the folk community, it has since been covered by many important folk and country artists. Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time. Covers=The Kingston Trio's recording The Kingston Trio met Jane Bowers while playing shows in Austin, Texas in the late 1950s. They went on to record several of her songs, including \\"Remember the Alamo\\". The song was released with slightly different lyrics on their 1959 album At Large, which subsequently reached No. 1 on the Billboard pop album charts in the United States. Johnny Cash's recording In the early 1960s Johnny Cash recorded \\"Remember the Alamo\\" with Tex Ritter's original lyrics. He also utilized different instrumentation from the Kingston Trio's version by adding a military drumbeat and lush backing vocals. The song was included on his 1963 album Ring of Fire: The Best of Johnny Cash which also reached No. 1 in the United States. Willie Nelson's recording Willie Nelson recorded the song for his 1968 concept album Texas in My Soul. This version is very similar to the one by Johnny Cash. Donovan's recording British singer- songwriter Donovan recorded \\"Remember the Alamo\\" with a mix of both Kingston Trio revised lyrics and Tex Ritter's original lyrics in early 1965 for inclusion on his debut album What's Bin Did and What's Bin Hid: Although he had never visited the United States, Donovan was deeply interested in the American folk tradition. He stripped away all backing vocals, military drumbeats and militant guitar strumming and simply sang the song with an acoustic guitar as accompaniment. In early 1966, Donovan was still suffering from the legal battles between his original record label Pye Records and his new label Epic Records. During the dispute, Pye Records released \\"Josie\\" without Donovan's approval and the single failed to chart. Not long after, Pye Records culled \\"Remember the Alamo\\" from What's Bin Did and What's Bin Hid and prepared it for single release in the United Kingdom. The song was backed with \\"The Ballad of a Crystal Man\\" and released in April 1966 (Pye 7N 17088). The single was quickly withdrawn from the market not long after its release, ostensibly due to the ongoing contractual battles, and never charted. John Otway and Wild Willy Barrett's recording British musicians John Otway and Wild Willy Barrett recorded the song on their 1978 album Deep & Meaningless. The album was re-released in 2007. The version is a colourful one, with strangled singing, pounding drums and the sound of cannon. Unlike in other versions, the courier referred to in the third verse is a woman. Asleep at the Wheel's recording Texas Swing band Asleep at the Wheel released its version of the song in 2003 on Asleep at the Wheel Remembers The Alamo. Since the early 1970s this group has performed big band Western swing in the style of Bob Wills and The Texas Playboys, and has a devoted following in the US and the UK as well. The song is part of a theme album about the Battle of the Alamo, and includes traditional tunes (\\"Deguello\\", \\"The Yellow Rose of Texas\\") and more recent whimsical songs (\\"The Ballad of Davy Crockett\\", \\"Don't Go There\\"). \\"Remember the Alamo\\" is sung by longtime frontman Ray Benson, and the band performs the song in the traditional free and flowing Texas Swing style.

It seems certain that the design for the 18-knot tanker (Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey Design No. 652 NDF) evolved out of the bureau's (C&R;) design for a fleet oiler.\\" Three of the original twelve ships were commissioned directly into the Navy at launch in 1939; the remainder entered merchant service with Standard Oil of New Jersey and Keystone Tankships before being acquired under the Two-Ocean Navy Act of July 1940. A further eighteen were built for the Navy between 1943 and 1946, with five additional units, sometimes called the Mispillion class, built to the slightly larger Type T3-S2-A3 design. Four of the Cimarrons were converted to escort carriers in 1942; two others were sunk by enemy action.

This is further complicated by the fact that these ships were jumboized in the 1960s, together with , , and , for some then comprising the Ashtabula class ‚Äì sometimes with or without the Mispillions. Adding to the confusion, some sources refer to the 18 war- construction repeat Cimarrons as the Ashtabula class. The argument for separation of Ashtabula, Caloosahatchee, and Canisteo as a separate class from Mispillion, Navasota, Passumpsic, Pawcatuck, and Waccamaw can be made by comparing the actual design and equipment of the two groups. The Ashtabulas and Mispillions are quite different in appearance and UNREP equipment. The three Ashtabulas have a fully enclosed well deck, no exterior deck walkways on the forward superstructure, a tunnel through the forward superstructure to allow the movement of cargo to the forward deck, two sets of STREAM gear, the second being forward of the forward superstructure, and no helo deck on the bow. The Mispillions have none of these features. * ; launched & commissioned 1945, jumboized 1965, transferred to MSC 1974, retired 1990, struck 1995, NDRF, sold for scrapping 3 December 2011 * ; launched 1945, commissioned 1946, jumboized 1964, transferred to MSC 1975, retired 1991, struck 1992, sold for scrapping 1995 * ; launched 1945, commissioned 1946, jumboized 1965, transferred to MSC 1973, retired, struck & sold for scrapping 1991 * ; launched 1945, commissioned 1946, jumboized 1965, transferred to MSC 1975, retired & struck 1991, sold for scrapping 2005 * ; launched 1945, commissioned 1946, jumboized 1965, transferred to MSC 1975, retired 1989, struck 1991, sold for scrapping 2005 Jumboization From 1964 through 1967, eight of the T3 type oilers were \\"jumboized\\" in order to increase their capacity to 180,000 barrels, which the Navy considered the amount necessary to support a supercarrier and its jet air wing's fuel needs. This jumboization was done by cutting the ships in two with cutting torches, then the aft section was pulled away, and new mid-body moved in and welded to the bows and sterns. After many other cutting and welding modifications a new long ship was created; a helipad was also fitted forward on the five Mispillions. Ashtabula, Caloosahatchee and Canisteo were jumboized after the five Mispillions and were given a limited capacity for ammunition and dry stores as well as a new midships superstructure and full scantlings, whereas AO-105 through 109 retained their shelter-deck configuration. Importance The US Navy's mastery of underway replenishment and its ability to refuel the fleet at sea without returning to port was a major factor in its successful operations against the Japanese during the Second World War. As the largest and fastest of the Navy's oilers, the Cimarrons were the principal class employed in direct support of the task forces. Many of the Cimarron class continued to sustain this function through the Korean and Vietnam wars as well, with the \\"jumbos\\" serving right up to the Persian Gulf War. US Navy captains who had flight status (\\"wings\\") were eligible to command aircraft carriers, but it was a prerequisite that the officer in question first have a \\"deep-draft\\" command; accordingly the Navy assigned these officers to oilers which had a similar draft.

Biography Landstad was born in the village of M√•s√∏y in Finnmark, Norway. He was one of ten children born to the parish priest Hans Landstad (1771‚Äì1838) and Margrethe Elisabeth Schnitler (1768‚Äì1850). His father was a minister, who first worked in √òksnes in 1806, then relocated to Vinje in 1811 and to Seljord in 1819. His grandfather was Peter Schnitler (1690‚Äì1751). He was a cousin of the priest and local historian Hans Peter Schnitler Krag (1794‚Äì1855). Landstad received a theology degree (cand.theol.) in 1827, and worked after that as the resident chaplain in Gausdal for six years. After that he worked in various parishes in Telemark and √òstfold before he became the minister of Sandar in Vestfold in 1859. He is well known for introducing popular, contemporary Norwegian language into the hymns he wrote, contributing significantly to the spirit of Norwegian romantic nationalism, which grew in Norway during this period. Although criticized at the time for the use of unscientific methods, today it is commonly accepted that he contributed significantly to the preservation of traditional ballads. His single greatest achievement was the Landstad hymnal (Landstads kirkesalmebog). He included about 50 of his own hymns in it and completed the editing in 1861. Later revisions were used in Norwegian (bokm√•l) parishes until 1985. The current official church hymnal contains a number of his hymns as well as his translations of foreign-language hymns. Personal life He married Wilhelmine Margrete Marie Lassen (1808‚Äì1892) in 1828. They were the parents of twelve children, of whom six died in early childhood. He died in 1880 at Kristiania (now Oslo) and was buried at V√•r Frelsers gravlund. Publications * 1852: Norske Folkeviser. 3 vols. Christiania: C.

Jonathan Hale (born Jonathan Hatley, March 21, 1891 - February 28, 1966) was a Canadian-born film and television actor. Life and career Hale was born in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Before his acting career, Hale worked in the Diplomatic Corps. Hale is most well known as Dagwood Bumstead's boss, Julius Caesar Dithers, in the Blondie film series in the 1940s. He is also notable for playing Inspector Fernack in various The Saint films by RKO Pictures. In 1950 he made two appearances in The Cisco Kid as Barry Owens. He also appeared in two different episodes of Adventures of Superman: \\"The Evil Three\\", in which he played a murderous \\"Southern Colonel\\"-type character, and \\"Panic in the Sky\\", one of the most famous episodes, in which he played the lead astronomer at the Metropolis Observatory, actually a California observatory. Among the relatively few television programs on which Hale appeared are the religion anthology series Crossroads, The Loretta Young Show, Brave Eagle, Schlitz Playhouse, The Joey Bishop Show, and Walt Disney Presents: \\"A Tribute to Joel Chandler Harris\\". Death Hale committed suicide on February 28, 1966. He was found dead that evening in his room at the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California. Hale had taken his own life with a .38 caliber pistol, which was found near his body. He was 74. Hale was interred at Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery in North Hollywood, California. Hale's grave went unmarked for more than four decades, until a proper headstone was erected by donations from the \\"Dearly Departed\\" fan-based group in 2013; he is now honored with the inscription, \\"We Remembered You\\".

First demonstrated in 1978, it was invented by UK-based, US-born film director Cy Endfield and his partner Chris Rainey and was marketed in the early 1980s by Microwriter Ltd, of Mitcham, Surrey, UK. By using a mnemonic alphabet, it was claimed to allow note-taking of up to 8,000 characters at an input rate averaging 1.5 times that of handwriting.[The Microwriter Technology Week20 March 1982 p39] A Microwriter MW4 (circa 1980)  The Microwriter MW4  Although there was an earlier unit with an LED display, the MW4 with an LCD was the most common unit. The 23 cm √ó 12 cm √ó 5 cm (9\\" x 5\\" x 2\\") device comprises: * A six-button chording keyboard. * A single line LCD. * An 8 bit CDP1802 microprocessor. * Complete Word processing software in ROM. * 16 kilobytes of RAM. * Rechargeable Nickel-cadmium batteries - sufficient to run the device for 30 hours. * Various interfaces (see below). This device is capable of allowing the user to enter and edit several pages of text - and by connecting a printer to the RS-232 serial port connector, documents can be printed without the aid of a separate computer. It was first sold in the UK in most mail-order shops in computing magazines such as YOUR COMPUTER from Spring/Summer 1983 and cost around ¬£400-¬£500 (equivalent to around ¬£1500 in 2014).  Keyboard  The keyboard uses one button for each finger and two for the thumb of the user's right hand. The five buttons immediately beneath the fingers are pressed in different combinations to generate all letters. The second thumb button is used to toggle through a range of modes that allow the user to switch case, enter numbers, insert punctuation and even add ASCII control characters, to be used in editing the document being prepared. To type a letter \\"T\\", for example, the user would tap the top thumb button to shift to uppercase, then chord a \\"t\\" by pressing the index finger and ring finger buttons simultaneously. The manufacturers claimed that most people could learn to use it in just a couple of hours. With some practice, it is possible to become a faster typist with the Microwriter than with a conventional keyboard, providing that what is being entered is just text. Typing is slowed if a substantial number of special characters have to be entered using the \\"shifting\\" mechanism. Learning the chords for the basic letters and numbers is facilitated by a set of flash-cards that show simple mnemonics for each character.  External ports  At the top end of the unit is a 25 pin D-type connector providing an RS-232 port, an interface to an audio cassette player for saving and restoring files and a small white on/off button. At the other end is the connector for the battery charger and a 37 pin D-type connector that can be hooked up to an optional external unit to allow the Microwriter to be connected to a television and thus to perform full-screen editing. The serial port can be used to connect the Microwriter directly to a printer, or to allow it to be plugged into a computer to function in place of the conventional keyboard.  Reception  Despite a lack of similar products, the Microwriter was not a success, and ceased production in 1985. Microwriters were sold direct, in the USA the advertised price was $499.00USDMicrowriter advertising brochure and materials. which might have been too high for a successful product offering. A MicroWriter, MicroWriter AgendA, and its modern successor the CyKey. A cut-down version of the Microwriter, known as the \\"Quinkey\\", was sold as a keyboard add-on for the BBC Micro computer connecting via the analogue port. It came with a game that helped the user to learn the chords. There were two versions of the interface software, one optimised for entering BBC BASIC commands, the other for word processing. Later, drivers were created for the Amstrad CPC and PC1512 home computers that worked through the digital joystick ports, and a version for IBM PC's running MSDOS that used the IBM RS232 port control pins as a digital port for a 2x3 key matrix. These saw limited use.  Microwriter AgendA  The Microwriter AgendA was one of the first PDAs.AgendA Released in 1989, it includes a set of small \\"conventional\\" keys arranged inside the half circle of a Microwriter chording keyboard with larger keys. It has 32k of storage, pluggable memory modules, a 4-line LCD screen, and advertised excellent build quality and long battery life. It was designed for text-mode note-taking without a conventional desk or keyboard. In 1990 it was awarded the British Design Award. Interface cables were available for the common serial (RS-232) and parallel (printer) ports of the day. These use a \\"smart\\" cable connected to a single I¬≤C bus on the AgendA.  CyKey  Chris Rainey, the co-inventor of Microwriter, re-introduced Microwriting for PC and Palm PDAs with a standalone miniature chording keyboard called CyKey. CyKey is named after the Microwriter chord system's co-inventor Cy Endfield.  SiWriter  The SiWriter is an app for the iPad and iPhone which uses a close variant of the microwriter chording system developed by Cy Enfield. It is available via the Apple app store. The system is let down by the lack of haptic feedback - you can't tell if your fingers are in the right place without looking, but you get better with practice. The finger pad positions are adjustable to fit your hand size. It also works for left handed users and has a live speech output facility that could be helpful for people with speech impairments.

The square and the surrounding buildings are all built in a 20th-century modern architectural style. History In 1976 Hongkong Land, the developer of the adjacent Connaught Centre (now Jardine House), approached the Urban Council and offered to help fund construction of the square. The company procured a preliminary layout plan and selected the Henry Moore sculpture. On 17 September 1976 the council agreed to proceed with project on a joint venture basis with Hongkong Land. Hongkong Land funded about 25 per cent of the project and retained ownership of the sculpture, while the council covered the remaining cost and managed the space following completion. The square was completed in December 1977. The square and the sculpture were both formally unveiled on 20 December 1977 by Urban Council chairman A. de O. Sales. Features The focal point of the square is a sculpture by English artist Henry Moore titled Double Oval, one of two casts from a 1966 mould. Upon its unveiling in December 1977 it was dedicated to Vernon Roberts, former director and general manager of the Hongkong Land company, who had died on 21 October of that year.

When the surface of the material briefly melts, surface tension smooths the surface. Operator skill is critical with this method. When done properly, flame plastic polishing produces the clearest finish, especially when polishing acrylic. This method is most applicable to flat external surfaces. Flame polishing is frequently used in acrylic plastic fabrication because of its high speed compared to abrasive methods. In this application, an oxyhydrogen torch is typically used, one reason being that the flame chemistry is unlikely to contaminate the plastic. Flame polishing is essential to creation of the glass pipettes used for the patch clamp technique of voltage clamping.  Equipment  Machines used for flame polishing make a combination of oxygen and hydrogen from water and input it into a precision flame nozzle which can output flames that range from 4500 - 6000 degrees Fahrenheit. The process is best used on acrylic or glass with curved or sloped surfaces. A specially designed machine called the hydro flame is most commonly used in this line of work. The hydro flame is a gas powered generator that uses distilled water and electricity to split water molecules to produce the flame.

Construction and commissioning Brownsville, originally classified as patrol gunboat, PG-118, was reclassified as a patrol frigate, PF-10, on 15 April 1943. She was laid down on 14 September 1943, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 1428, at the Permanente Metals Richmond Shipyard #4, Richmond, California. Brownsville was launched on 14 November 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Lillian Runyon Burney; and commissioned on 6 May 1944, with Commander Hollis M. Warner, USCG, in command. Service history=United States Navy Brownsville completed outfitting at Richmond, between 6 May and 19 June. At the end of this, on 19 June, the patrol frigate headed south to San Diego, where she engaged in a month of shakedown training. On 21 July, she completed that training and began post-shakedown availability at Alameda and Oakland, California. After several extensions, she completed her repair period near the end of September, and reported for duty at San Diego, on 28 September. Brownsville spent her entire, brief Navy career assigned to the Commander, Western Sea Frontier. From September 1944 to April 1945, she served in the Southern California Sector, operating out of San Diego. She conducted barrier patrols and escorted coastal shipping in addition to amphibious training and anti-submarine warfare exercises. After April 1945, the patrol frigate moved to the Northern California Sector and, after a brief assignment patrolling off the entrance to San Francisco Bay, began weather patrols and planeguard duty out of San Francisco. That duty, punctuated by repair periods at Treasure Island, lasted until 15 April 1946, when she was decommissioned, turned over to the Coast Guard on a loan basis, and commissioned as USCGC Brownsville. United States Coast Guard The Coast Guard made use of her only until the following August. On 2 August 1946, she was decommissioned once more and later returned to the Navy. Declared surplus to the needs of the Navy, Brownsville was berthed at Seattle, Washington, for more than a year. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 25 September 1946, and she was sold to the Franklin Shipwrecking Company on 30 September 1947, for scrapping.

Life and career Rolph Grant was a middle-order batsman and off-spin bowler. He made his highest first-class score for Trinidad against Barbados in 1933-34, when he scored 55 and 152, top-scoring in each innings. In the 10-wicket victory over Hampshire on the 1939 tour he top-scored with 54 and took his best figures of 4 for 41 and 2 for 24. When the West Indies needed an opening batsman during the 1939 tour he took over the role, opening with Jeffrey Stollmeyer in all three Tests, with a highest score of 47. He took over the captaincy of the West Indies team from his brother Jackie Grant. Two other brothers played cricket but without the same level of success. Rolph had not always been picked for the Cambridge University team, but he was a gifted sportsman, being a national amateur footballer and being heavyweight boxing champion for his country. Later pundits put Rolph's selection as captain down to his race. The selectors wanted a white captain and Rolph fitted that requirement. Discussing the West Indian captaincy in his history of West Indian cricket, Michael Manley described Grant as \\"a man of great decency and intelligence\\", but in his qualifications for the captaincy he was \\"far more importantly the son of a wealthy and powerful Trinidadian family ... It was the families who were accustomed to ruling who were assumed to produce the sons who were capable of leading.\\"Michael Manley, A History of West Indies Cricket, Andre Deutsch, London, 1988, p. 66.

He attended Florida A&M; University, working with the legendary coach Jake Gaither. Galimore is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame. Galimore possessed incredible speed and lateral movement; many of the opposing players of the time stated that they believed Galimore could run side-to-side down the field just as fast as most men could in a straight line. His running style could be said to most resemble the style of Billy Sims or perhaps Terrell Davis, but faster. In a documentary short by NFL Films on Galimore, it was said that he was probably the last great find before NFL scouting became sophisticated. Bears assistant coach Phil Handler, while scouting for talent in Florida, received a tip about Galimore's prowess as a halfback, and the Bears subsequently drafted him in the fifth round (58th overall) of the 1956 NFL Draft. His contemporaries (including Chuck Bednarik and Doug Atkins) referred to Galimore as one of the best runners they ever faced. Galimore's last visit to his hometown of St. Augustine, Florida came just weeks before his death, and he participated in the St. Augustine movement during the Civil Rights Movement, becoming the first Black person who was able to register as a guest at the previously all-white Ponce de Leon Motor Lodgehttp://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=17916 (where the arrest of the 72-year-old mother of the governor of Massachusetts for trying to be served in a racially integrated group had made national headlines a few months before). Galimore's civil rights activism is honored with a Freedom Trail marker at his home at 57 Chapin Street in St. Augustine. His widow, Mrs. Audrey Galimore, took part in the dedication of the marker on July 2, 2007. A community center in the historic Lincolnville neighborhood of the city also bears Galimore's name, and he is depicted on a historical mural painted by schoolchildren on Washington Street. Death At age 29, Galimore and teammate Bo Farrington were killed in an automobile accident on July 27, 1964, in Rensselaer, Indiana.

It is a highly social and vocal bird found in forest and scrub from the Himalayan foothills to Southeast Asia.  Audio  File:Garrulax-leucolophus-white-crested- laughingthrush-singing.oggWhite-crested laughingthrush singing - Khao Yai National Park, Thailand File:Garrulax leucolophus (Wei√ühauben-H√§herling - White-crested Laughingthrush) ‚Äî Weltvogelpark Walsrode 2013.oggThe voice of the white-crested laughingthrush  Taxonomy  The white-crested laughingthrush is a member of the family Leiothrichidae, recently split from the Old Word babbler family, Timaliidae. Its scientific name Garrulax leucolophus comes from Latin garrire \\"to chatter\\", in reference to its very vocal nature, and from Greek leuk√≥s \\"white\\" and lophos \\"crest\\". Four subspecies are identified: G. l. leucolophus or Western White-Crested laughingthrush, G. l. patkaicus, G. l. belangeri, and G. l. diardi or Eastern White-crested laughingthrush. A former subspecies, G. l. bicolor, has been re- classified as a species of its own, the endemic Sumatran laughingthrush, on account of its lack of characteristic rufous plumage, different face pattern, and shorter tail.  Description  Pangolakha Wildlife Sanctuary, East Sikkim district, Sikkim, India. Like other birds in its genus, G. leucolophus has a stocky build, with strong blackish legs and bill, rounded tail, and voluminous plumage. Its body length averages 30 cm, and its tail ranges from 13 to 15 cm. It is named after its characteristic white hood and raised crest. It is also easily recognizable due to its broad and elongated black eye-mask. The mantle, back and underparts from the lower breast down are rufescent, contrasting with the white head, throat and upper chest and fading into darker olive-brown on the tail and upper wings. The nape is light gray. Females look almost identical to males but have a smaller crest, duller mantle, and slightly more pronounced gray on the nape. Juveniles can be identified by their shorter crest and tail, paler mask, brownish nape and brighter mantle. Subspecies have subtle variations in plumage: patkaicus' mantle is a darker, richer chestnut; belangeri has white extending lower onto the belly and paler underparts; diardi even more so and with a brighter upper mantle.  Habitat and Distribution = Native range  G. leucolophus has one of the widest ranges of all laughingthrushes and as such is at minimal risk of being threatened by extinction. It is native to the following countries: India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, China, Vietnam, and Thailand. The four subspecies have slightly different distributions: leucolophus: N India, Nepal, Bhutan, S China (Tibet) patkaicus: NE India, Bengladesh, Myanmar, S China (Yunnan) belangeri: Myanmar, Thailand diardi: Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, S China (Yunnan)  Introduced populations  The White-crested laughingthrush is a popular caged bird species, and it is likely that individuals who escaped or were voluntarily released during religious practices are the cause for the expansion of G. l. diardi's range to Malaysia and Singapore in the 1970s-1980s. The exotic bird trade has brought it to the UK and US as well, but no wild populations have been reported there. It is thought to only remain in small numbers in Malaysia due to trapping, but in Singapore it has become well-established and may be displacing native birds with similar ground-foraging habits that are threatened by habitat fragmentation, such as Abbott's Babbler. Its success as an invasive species is attributed, among other factors, to social, cooperative behaviour, high flock densities, and being able to adapt to many different habitats including parks, gardens and degraded forest.  Habitat  G. leucolophus is commonly found in foothill forests, up to elevations of 1600m. It favours dense, moist and shady thickets and scrubs, and the edge and understory of broadleaved secondary forests, where it can hide from predators and take shelter from the subtropical sun. It will typically only come out of cover to feed on the ground. The ideal habitat of the white-crested also includes bamboos, which provide excellent nesting substrate and camouflage.  Behaviour = Vocalization  White-crested laughingthrushes are social birds, usually in flocks of 6-12 individuals (but reportedly up to 40). These small parties can be very noisy as a leader initiates a call (typically with short syllables such as \\"ow‚Äù, ‚Äúu‚Äôow‚Äù or ‚Äúu‚Äôah\\") and is answered with a chorus, in sometimes disorderly fashion. The name \\"laughingthrush\\" comes from the \\"loud cackling outbursts\\" they produce, often followed by a quieter, more pleasant chatter or muttering (\\"kerWICKerWICK\\" or \\"nYUKoop nYUKoop\\"). In total, 4 different types of vocalizations exist, in order of increasing length and complexity: short sounds, phrases (repeated elements), sentences and subsongs. Since they are a highly gregarious species, most of the sounds they produce serve a social purpose, such as reminding other members of their flock of their presence and their movements, alerting them of danger or intruders, or inciting mobbing (they are known to be aggressive birds to different flocks or species).  Diet  Similarly to other laughingthrushes, G. leucolophus is omnivorous and opportunistic. It subsists mostly on invertebrates such as beetles, spiders, flies, mealworms and caterpillars, snails and leeches. However, it also eats fruits, seeds, nectar, and even small reptiles and amphibians (snakes, lizards and frogs). In Singapore, observers have noticed individuals picking at human food and garbage. One witness even reported birds soliciting humans for scraps. When looking for food, G. leucolophus forages on the ground, often in small parties, hopping from one place to the next and tossing the leaf litter aside with its beak to uncover invertebrates.  Reproduction  White- crested laughingthrushes start reproducing in their second year. They breed several times between February to September. Nests are shallow and cup-shaped, in shrubs and trees at heights between 2-6m, made with bamboo leaves and grass bound with twigs and stems. In each nest are laid 2-6 pure white eggs, estimated at 6.5 g each, which are incubated for 13‚Äì17 days by both parents. The male and female also share brooding and feeding duties while the chicks develop from completely naked to miniature adults in the 14‚Äì16 days after hatching. These tasks are not distributed just between the parents, however ‚Äî White-crested laughingthrushes are cooperative breeders. A female may share a nest with another, and 3 or more adults may take turns incubating the eggs and feeding the chicks. In fact, these \\"helpers\\" are not always adults: young from the current year's previous clutch sometimes help with building the nest or feeding their siblings.

In the summer of 1861, Union troops, which included a number of newly-formed Western Virginia regiments, under General George McClellan, drove off Confederate troops under General Robert E. Lee. This essentially freed Unionists in the northwestern counties of Virginia to form a functioning government of their own as a result of the Wheeling Convention. Prior to the admission of West Virginia the government in Wheeling formally claimed jurisdiction over all of Virginia, although from its creation it was firmly committed to the formation of a separate state. After Lee's departure, western Virginia continued to be a target of Confederate raids. Both the Confederate and state governments in Richmond refused to recognize the creation of the new state in 1863, and thus for the duration of the war the Confederacy regarded its own military offensives within West Virginia not as invasion but rather as an effort to liberate what it considered to be enemy-occupied territory administered by an illegitimate government in Wheeling. Nevertheless, due to its increasingly precarious military position and desperate shortage of resources, Confederate military actions in what it continued to regard as \\"western Virginia\\" focused less on reconquest as opposed to both on supplying the Confederate Army with provisions as well as attacking the vital Baltimore and Ohio Railroad that linked the northeast with the Midwest, as exemplified in the Jones-Imboden Raid. Guerrilla warfare also gripped the new state, especially in the Allegheny Mountain counties to the east, where loyalties were much more divided than in the solidly Unionist northwest part of the state. Despite this, the Confederacy was never able to seriously threaten the Unionists' overall control of West Virginia. History=Political events On April 17, 1861, the Virginia state convention in Richmond declared secession. Nearly all delegates from counties west of the Allegheny Mountains voted against secession, and most people and officials in that area refused any directions from the secessionist state government. On May 15, western Virginia Unionists convened the first session of the Wheeling Convention. Many of the delegates were informally or self- appointed, so the Convention only denounced secession and called for a formal election of delegates. The elected delegates met in the second session on 11 June. On 20 June the Convention declared that by acceding to secession, the officials of the state government in Richmond had forfeited their offices, which were now vacant. The Convention then elected replacements for these state offices, creating the Restored Government of Virginia. The \\"Restored\\" government was generally supported in areas where secession was opposed. Union troops also held the three northernmost counties in the Shenandoah Valley, and despite the pro-secession views of most residents, these counties were also subjected to the \\"Restored\\" government. At the Wheeling Convention, some delegates proposed the immediate establishment of a separate state. However, other delegates pointed out that the creation of a new state would require the consent of Virginia, under Article IV of the Constitution. Thus it was necessary to establish the Restored Government of Virginia to give that consent, which was granted 20 August 1861. A referendum in October 1861 approved statehood; a constitutional convention met, and its work was approved by referendum in April 1862. Congress approved statehood that December, with the condition that slavery must gradually abolish in the new state. This condition required a new constitutional convention and referendum, which was approved. On 20 June 1863, the newly proclaimed state of West Virginia was admitted to the Union, including all the western counties and the lower (northern) Shenandoah \\"panhandle\\". All the northern states had free public school systems before the war, but not the border states. West Virginia set up its system in 1863. Over bitter opposition it established an almost-equal education for black children, most of whom were ex-slaves.F. Talbott, \\"Some Legislative and Legal Aspects of the Negro Question in West Virginia during the Civil War and Reconstruction,\\" West Virginia History, Jan 1963, Vol. 24 Issue 2, pp 110-133 When Union troops occupied parts of eastern Virginia such as Alexandria and Norfolk, these areas came under the jurisdiction of the Restored Government. They were not included in West Virginia. With West Virginia statehood, the Restored government relocated to Alexandria. The pro- Confederate state government in Richmond maintained its claim to the Commonwealth's antebellum borders and, under the auspices of the state's 1851 constitution, administered the regions of the Commonwealth still held under Confederate arms - at the time of West Virginia's statehood this included at least some measure of control in about thirteen counties claimed by the newly admitted state. Many localities (especially in the southeastern part of the state) sent representatives to both the Wheeling and Richmond state legislatures. As was the case with all regions the Confederacy claimed but did not control, the Confederate States Congress seated Representatives from districts encompassing the whole of Virginia's antebellum borders until its dissolution. In House districts where the Confederates could not hold conventional elections, the Confederate Congress accepted the fragmentary Congressional results from army and refugee camps as representative of the majority of residents. While Confederate Congressional elections were ostensibly nonpartisan, especially in Virginia districts under Union occupation the administration of President Jefferson Davis manipulated the electoral process to ensure the election of pro-administration representatives, in large part to counteract the increasing tendency of House districts still under Confederate control to elect anti-administration candidates. While the level of effective Confederate control over West Virginia would continue to diminish as the war progressed, authorities in Richmond were able to maintain at least a tenuous control over West Virginia's southeastern border regions until the end of the war. Slavery During the Civil War, a Unionist government in Wheeling, Virginia, presented a statehood bill to Congress in order to create a new state from 48 counties in western Virginia. The new state would eventually incorporate 50 counties. The issue of slavery in the new state delayed approval of the bill. In the Senate Charles Sumner objected to the admission of a new slave state, while Benjamin Wade defended statehood as long as a gradual emancipation clause would be included in the new state constitution.James Oakes, Freedom National: The Destruction of Slavery in the United States, 1861-1865, W.W. Norton, 2012, pgs. 296-97 Two senators represented the Unionist Virginia government, John S. Carlile and Waitman T. Willey. Senator Carlile objected that Congress had no right to impose emancipation on West Virginia, while Willey proposed a compromise amendment to the state constitution for gradual abolition. Sumner attempted to add his own amendment to the bill, which was defeated, and the statehood bill passed both houses of Congress with the addition of what became known as the Willey Amendment. President Lincoln signed the bill on December 31, 1862. Voters in western Virginia approved the Willey Amendment on March 26, 1863. President Lincoln had issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, which exempted from emancipation the border states (four slave states loyal to the Union) as well as some territories occupied by Union forces within Confederate states. Two additional counties were added to West Virginia in late 1863, Berkeley and Jefferson. The slaves in Berkeley were also under exemption but not those in Jefferson County. As of the census of 1860, the 49 exempted counties held some 6000 slaves over 21 years of age who would not have been emancipated, about 40% of the total slave population. The terms of the Willey Amendment only freed children, at birth or as they came of age, and prohibited the importation of slaves. West Virginia became the 35th state on June 20, 1863, and the last slave state admitted to the Union.Alton Hornsby, Jr.,Black America, A State-by-State Historical Encyclopedia, Greenwood, 2011, vol. 2, pg. 922 Eighteen months later, the West Virginia legislature completely abolished slavery, and also ratified the 13th Amendment on February 3, 1865. Military events In April 1861, Virginia troops under Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson occupied Harpers Ferry and part of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad leading into western Virginia. They seized many B&O; locomotives and railcars on May 23. In May and June 1861, Confederate forces advanced into western Virginia to impose control by the Richmond government and the Confederacy. They got no further than Philippi, due to bad roads. Then Union troops under McClellan drove them back in July. There was additional campaigning further south, where Greenbrier County was pro-Confederate, enabling Confederate troops to enter Nicholas County to the west. In September 1861, Union troops drove the Confederates out of Nicholas County and defeated their counterattack at Cheat Mountain. Thereafter all of the trans-Allegheny region was under firm Union control except for some of the easternmost counties. Greenbrier County was occupied in May 1862. Pro-Confederate guerrillas burned and plundered in some sections, and were not entirely suppressed until after the war was ended. There were two minor Confederate expeditions against the northeastern corner of the west later on: Jackson's Romney Expedition in January 1862; and the Jones-Imboden Raid in May‚ÄìJune 1863. Confederate Memorial, Romney. Union strategy for the region was to protect the vital B&O; Railroad and also attack eastward into the Shenandoah Valley and southwestern Virginia. This latter goal proved impossible, due to the poor roads across mountainous terrain. The B&O; passed across the lower (northern) end of the Shenandoah, east of the Alleghenies. This area was therefore occupied by Union troops for nearly all of the war, and was a scene of frequent combat. Harpers Ferry was the site of a major U.S. Army arsenal, and was taken by Confederates in the opening days of the war, and again during the Maryland Campaign of 1862. During the Maryland Campaign it was a route of invasion and retreat for the Army of Northern Virginia; the campaign concluded there with the Battle of Shepherdstown. Many soldiers from West Virginia served on both sides in the war. Those in Confederate service were in \\"Virginia\\" regiments. Those in Union service were also in \\"Virginia\\" regiments until statehood, when several Unionist \\"Virginia\\" regiments were redesignated \\"West Virginia\\" regiments. Among these were the 7th West Virginia Infantry, famed for actions at Antietam and Gettysburg, and the 3rd West Virginia Cavalry, which also fought at Gettysburg. On the Confederate side, Albert G. Jenkins, a former U.S. Representative, recruited a brigade of cavalry in western Virginia, which he led until his death in May 1864. Other western Virginians served under Brig. Gen. John Imboden and in the Stonewall Brigade under Brig. Gen. James A. Walker.Snell, Mark A., West Virginia and the Civil War, History Press, 2011, pg. 194 Guerrilla warfare On May 28, 1861 one of the first trials of the Civil War for sabotage took place in Parkersburg, Virginia. A group of men were found playing cards under a B&O; railroad bridge and arrested by Federal authorities. The trial was conducted by Judge William Lowther Jackson (later, Gen. W.L. Jackson, C.S.A.). The men were acquitted, since no actual crime had taken place, but Parkersburg was split over the verdict, and Judge Jackson left to join Col. Porterfield at Philippi.Hardway, Ronald V., \\"On Our Own Soil. William Lowther Jackson and the Civil War in West Virginia's Mountains\\". Quarrier Press, 2003, pgs. 39-40Union and Confederate territorial losses in West Virginia 1861-1865 With the defeat of Confederate forces at the Battle of Philippi and the Battle of Cheat Mountain only occasionally would they occupy parts of western Virginia. Local supporters of Richmond were left to their own devices. Many guerrilla units originated in the pre-war militia, and these were designated Virginia State Rangers and starting in June, 1862, these were incorporated into Virginia State Line regiments. By March, 1863, however, many were enlisted in the regular Confederate army.James Carter Linger, \\"Confederate Military Units from West Virginia\\", 2002 ed., pg. 20. There were others though who operated without sanction of the Richmond government, some fighting on behalf of the Confederacy, while others were nothing more than bandits who preyed on Union and Confederate alike. Early in the war captured guerrillas were sent to Camp Chase or Johnson Island in Ohio, Fort Delaware in Delaware and also the Atheneum in Wheeling. Some were paroled after taking an oath, but many returned to their guerrilla activities. The Union authorities began to organize their own guerrilla bands, the most famous of which was the \\"Snake Hunters\\", headed by Capt. Baggs. They patrolled Wirt and Calhoun counties through the winter of 1861‚Äì62 and captured scores of Moccasin Rangers, which they sent as prisoners to Wheeling. The fight against the rebel guerrillas took a new turn under Gen. John C. Fremont and Col. George Crook, who had spent his pre-war career as an \\"Indian fighter\\" in the Pacific Northwest. Col. Crook took command of the 36th Ohio Infantry, centered around Summersville, Nicholas County. He trained them in guerrilla tactics and adopted a \\"no prisoners\\" policy.Kenneth W. Noe, \\"Exterminating Savages\\" essay in \\"The Civil War in Appalachia\\", Univ. of Tennessee Press, 1997, pg. 115 \\"The Secessionist Army-Irregular Riflemen of the Alleghanies, Virginia\\", Harper's Weekly, July 20, 1861 On January 1, 1862, Crook led his men on an expedition north to Sutton, Braxton County, where he believed Confederate forces were located. None were found, but his troops encountered heavy guerrilla resistance and responded by burning houses and towns along the line of march.Noe, pg. 116 But by August, 1862, Unionist efforts were severely hampered with the withdrawal of troops to eastern Virginia. In this vacuum Gen. William W. Loring, C.S.A, recaptured the Kanawha valley, Gen. Albert Gallatin Jenkins, C.S.A., moved his forces through central West Virginia, capturing many supplies and prisoners.Richard O. Curry and F. Gerald Ham, \\"The Bushwhacker's War: Insurgency and Counter-Insurgency in West Virginia\\", Civil War History, December 1964, pgs. 428-29 Confederate recruitment increased, Gen. Loring opening recruitment offices as far north as Ripley. In response to rebel raids, Gen. Robert H. Milroy issued a command demanding reparations to be paid in cash and proceeded to assess fines against Tucker county citizens, guilty or not, and threatened them with the gallows or house-burning. Jefferson Davis and Confederate authorities lodged formal complaints with Gen. Henry Wager Halleck in Washington, who censured Gen. Milroy. However, Milroy argued in defense of his policy and was allowed to proceed. By early 1863 Union efforts in West Virginia were going badly. Unionists were losing confidence in the Wheeling government to protect them, and with the approaching dismemberment of Virginia into two states guerrilla activity increased in an effort to prevent organization of county governments. By 1864 some stability had been achieved in some central counties, but guerrilla activity was never effectively countered.Curry & Ham, pgs. 430-33 Union forces that were needed elsewhere were tied down in what many soldiers considered a backwater of the war. But Federal forces could not afford to ignore any rebel territory, particularly one so close to the Ohio River.Noe, \\"Exterminating Savages\\", pg. 120-121 As late as January, 1865, Gov. Arthur I. Boreman complained of large scale guerrilla activity as far north as Harrison and Marion counties. The Wheeling government was unable to control more than 20 to 25 counties in the new state.Curry, Richard O., \\"A House Divided\\", Univ. of Pittsburgh Press, 1964, pgs. 74, 77-78 In one last, brazen act of the guerrilla war, McNeill's Rangers of Hardy County kidnapped Generals George Crook and Benjamin F. Kelley from behind Union lines and delivered them as prisoners of war to Richmond. The Confederate surrender at Appomattox finally brought an end to guerrilla war in West Virginia.Jones, Virgil Carrington \\"Gray Ghosts and Rebel Raiders\\", Galahad Books, 1995 ed., pgs. 350-362 Soldiery On May 30, 1861, Brig. Gen. George B. McClellan in Cincinnati wrote to President Lincoln: \\"I am confidently assured that very considerable numbers of volunteers can be raised in Western Virginia...\\".The Civil War Papers of George B. McClellan: Selected Correspondence, p. 28 After nearly two months in the field in West Virginia he was less optimistic. He wrote to Gov. Francis Harrison Pierpont of the Restored Government of Virginia in Wheeling that he and his army were anxious to assist the new government, but that eventually they would be needed elsewhere, and that he urged that troops be raised \\"among the population\\". \\"Before I left Grafton I made requisitions for arms clothing etc for 10,000 Virginia troops ‚Äì I fear that my estimate was much too large.\\"The Civil War Papers of George B. McClellan: Selected Correspondence, pp. 63-4 On August 3, 1861, the Wellsburg \\"Herald\\" editorialized \\"A pretty condition Northwestern Virginia is in to establish herself as a separate state...after all the drumming and all the gas about a separate state she has actually organized in the field four not entire regiments of soldiers and one of these hails almost entirely from the Panhandle.\\"McGregor, \\"The Disruption of Virginia\\", p. 245, note 2. Similar difficulties were experienced by Confederate authorities at the beginning of the war. On May 14, 1861, Col. George A. Porterfield arrived in Grafton to secure volunteers, and reported slow enlistment. Col. Porterfield's difficulty ultimately, however, was lack of support by the Richmond government, which did not send enough guns, tents and other supplies. He eventually turned away hundreds of volunteers due to lack of equipment.White, Robert, Col. \\"Confederate Military History, Maryland and West Virginia\\", part 2, p. 15 Gen. Henry A. Wise also complained of recruitment in the Kanawha valley, though he eventually assembled 2,500 infantry, 700 cavalry, three battalions of artillery for a total of 4,000 men which became known as \\"Wise's Legion\\".Horn, \\"The Robert E. Lee Reader\\", p. 118 One regiment from the Wise legion, the 3rd Infantry (later reorganized as the 60th Virginia Infantry) was sent to South Carolina in 1862, and it was from Maj. Thomas Broun of the 3rd Infantry that Gen. Robert E. Lee bought his famous horse Traveller. In April 1862 the Confederate government instituted a military draft,Ayers, Edward L. In the Presence of Mine Enemies, W.W. Norton, 2003, pg. 241 and nearly a year later the U.S. government did the same. The Confederate draft was not generally effective in West Virginia due to the breakdown of Virginia state government in the western counties and Union occupation of the northern counties, although conscription did occur in the southern counties. In the southern and eastern counties of West Virginia Confederate recruitment continued at least until the beginning of 1865.Nov. 15, 1864, Lt. Col. V.A. Witcher reported to Maj. Gen. J.C. Breckenridge from Logan County Court House that he had 400 new recruits with him, 200 more waiting for him in Wyoming County, as well as 4-5 partially recruited companies. Official Records of the War of the Rebellion, Series 1, Vol. 43, pgs. 651-52. The Wheeling government asked for an exemption to the Federal draft, saying that they had exceeded their quota under previous calls.Current, Richard N. Lincoln's Loyalists, Oxford Univ. Press, 1994, pgs. 21-22 An exemption was granted for 1864, but in 1865 a new demand was made for troops, which Gov. Boreman struggled to fill. In some counties, ex-Confederates suddenly found themselves enrolled in the U.S. Army.Shaffer, John W. Clash of Loyalties, A Border County in the Civil War\\", West Virginia Univ. Press, 2003, pg. 78 The loyalty of some Federal troops had been questioned early in the war. The rapid conquest of northern West Virginia had caught a number of Southern sympathizers behind Union lines. A series of letters to Gen. Samuels and Gov. Pierpoint in the Dept. of Archives and History in Charleston, most dated 1862, reveal the concern of Union officers. Col. Harris, 10th Company, March 27, 1862, to Gov. Pierpoint: \\"The election of officers in the Gilmer County Company was a farce. The men elected were rebels and bushwhackers. The election of these men was intended, no doubt, as a burlesque on the reorganization of the militia.\\"McGregor, \\"The Disruption of Virginia\\", pp. 246-7, note 1. Letter to Governor Pierpoint from Fairmount, March 10, 1862, signed John Coogle, Company I, 18th Regiment. They had elected \\"a most vile Secessionist as Captain. A majority are rebels and would like nothing better than to hand over the organization to the South.\\" Because the government in Richmond did not keep separate military records for what would become West Virginia, there has never been an official count of Confederate service in West Virginia. Early estimates were very low, in 1901 historians Fast & Maxwell placed the figure at about 7,000.Fast, Richard E. & Hu Maxwell The History and Government of West Virginia, Morgantown, 1901, pg. 135 An exception to the low estimates is found in Why The Solid South?, whose authors believed the Confederate numbers exceeded Union numbers.Herbert, Hilary A. (ed.), Why The Solid South?, Baltimore, 1890, pg. 259 In subsequent histories the estimates rose, Otis K. Rice placed the number at 10,000-12,000.Rice, Otis K. West Virginia: A History, Lexington, KY, 1985, pg. 125 Richard O. Curry in 1964 placed the figure at 15,000.Curry, Richard O. A House Divided, Pittsburgh, 1964, pgs. 167-68 The first detailed study of Confederate soldiery estimates the number at 18,000,Dickinson, Jack L. Tattered Uniforms and Bright Bayonets: West Virginia's Confederate Soldiers, Huntington, WV, 1995 which is close to the 18,642 figure stated by the Confederate Dept. of Western Virginia in 1864.Headley, John W. Confederate Operations in Canada and New York, New York, 1906, pg. 471 In 1989 a study by James Carter Linger estimated the number at nearly 22,000.Linger, James Carter Confederate Military Units of West Virginia, Tulsa, OK, 2002 revised ed. The official number of Union soldiers from West Virginia is 31,884 as stated by the Provost Marshal General of the United States.Biennial Report of the Department of Archives and History of the State of West Virginia, Charleston, 1906, pg. 62 These numbers include, however, re-enlistment figures\\"...it was shown that on April 30. 1865, the State of West Virginia had furnished, of all arms and for different terms of service, 31,884 men, for service in the United States Army. These figures, however, include all re-enlistments of which there were quite a large number. Of these there were two regiments of Veteran Infantry, and one of Cavalry. They were composed of three years men who re- enlisted for the war. In addition to the men composing these regiments, numbers of others re-enlisted, so that it is believed that the actual number of troops from West Virginia in the United States service during the war was about 28,000.\\"Biennial report of the Department of Archives and History of the State of West Virginia, 1911, pg. 206. as well as out-of-state soldiers who enlisted in West Virginia regiments. In 1905 Charles H. Ambler estimated the number of native Union soldiers to be about 20,000.Ambler, Charles H. Disfranchisement in West Virginia, Yale Review, New Haven, 1905, pg. 38. Richard Current estimated native Union numbers at 29,000.Current, Richard Lincoln's Loyalists, Union Soldiers from the Confederacy, New York, 1992, pg. 216 In his calculations, however, he only allowed for a deduction of 2,000 out-of-state soldiers in West Virginia regiments. Ohio contributed nearly 5,000,Reid, Whitelaw Ohio in the War, Vol. II, pg. 3 with about 2,000 from Pennsylvania and other states. In 1995 the George Tyler Moore Center for the Study of the Civil War began a soldier-by-soldier count of all regiments that would include West Virginians, both Union and Confederate. They concluded that West Virginia contributed approximately 20,000-22,000 men each to both the Union and Confederate governments.Snell, Mark A., West Virginia and the Civil War, History Press, 2011, pg. 28, Nursing during the Civil War The Sisters of St. Joseph, who operated Wheeling Hospital in that city, were nurses during the war. They treated soldiers brought to the hospital and prisoners at the Athenaeum in downtown Wheeling. In 1864, the Union army took control of the hospital, and the sisters went on the federal payroll as matrons and nurses, beginning that summer. Several of them later received pensions in recognition of their service.

Based on the 1948 Niven Busch novel of the same name, its plot follows the ruthless daughter of a tyrannical rancher in 1870s New Mexico Territory who struggles with her stake in his estate. Released in August 1950 by Paramount Pictures, the film was a financial failure, but went on to accrue a reputation as a \\"Freudian Western,\\" and one of Mann's greatest contributions to the genre. In 2008, the film was released on DVD in the United States by The Criterion Collection. Plot Temple Caddy \\"T. C.\\" Jeffords is an elderly, tyrannical, and arrogant cattle baron who owns a sprawling property in the New Mexico Territory, called The Furies. He harbors special contempt for the Herrera family, who are squatting on the property. T. C.'s beloved daughter, Vance, is as obsessed with wealth and every bit as ruthless as her father, though she has a secret, close bond with Juan Herrera, whom she has known since childhood. However, Vance seeks a suitor who can run the giant ranch with her once her father dies . She falls in love with Rip Darrow, who believes a portion of The Furies' land is rightfully his and holds a grudge against T. C.; meanwhile, Vance is shocked when Rip accepts a $50,000 bribe from T. C. to permanently get out of her life. In town, Rip owns a saloon he calls \\"The Legal Tender\\"; he subsequently opens a bank near it. T. C. is so self-possessed, he pays bills with \\"T. C.\\" notes rather than actual dollars. One day, he brings a woman home to The Furies: Flo Burnett, who plans to marry T. C. for his money. When Vance confronts Flo, Flo unabashedly admits she is seeking the marriage for financial security, and tells Vance that she and T. C. are soon to be married in San Francisco. Together, Flo and T. C. inform Vance that they have arranged for an outsider to take over the maintenance The Furies, so as to take pressure off of Vance, as well as oust the Herreras from the property. Furthermore, they have planned an extended trip to Europe for Vance. Enraged by this news, Vance hurls a pair of scissors at Flo's face, permanently disfiguring her. Vance flees on horseback to the Herreras' home on The Furies. T. C. summons a number of his men to run the Herreras off the property. They arrive on horseback armed with guns, but the Herreras fight back by hurling boulders down the hill at them and returning fire. Vance stands by Juan's side as he fires back at her father's associates. The Herreras eventually surrender, and T. C. and his men execute Juan by hanging as Vance looks on. Before she departs, Vance proclaims her hatred for her father, and swears to him that she will ruin his life. Seeking vengeance, Vance travels throughout the American west, buying up all of the \\"T. C.\\" notes and dramatically eroding her father's wealth. At risk of losing his property, T. C. unsuccessfully seeks to borrow $50,000 from Flo to save The Furies. Meanwhile, Vance visits Rip, asking for assistance in her plot to ruin her father. Rip observes that Vance is consumed by hatred, but agrees to help her if she gives him a section of The Furies, to which she agrees. The two conspire to deceive T. C. by giving him false hope that a wealthy California investor is going to loan him the funds to save The Furies. When T. C. arrives at the bank to receive his \\"loan,\\" he is met by Vance and Rip, and offered a crate of $140,000 of his own \\"T. C.\\" notes, now worthless. Rather than lambasting his daughter, T. C. congratulates her on her cunning, and willingly relinquishes The Furies to her. He declares he will start his life over elsewhere the little means he has. T. C. exits the bank, and burns his box of currency outside. As he walks down the street arm-in-arm with Vance and Rip, he is shot to death by Juan's bereaved mother. Vance and Rip return to The Furies with T. C.'s body, where they plan his burial. CastAnalysis Film scholar Michael Adams, writing for the City University of New York, observes that the film blends archetypes borrowed from Greek tragedies as well as several works by Shakespeare, specifically King Lear and Macbeth. In a 1957 interview, director Anthony Mann stated that he felt the screenplay shared several similarities to the Fyodor Dostoevsky novel The Idiot. Production=Filming Filming took place primarily on location in Tucson, Arizona, beginning on November 9, 1949. Filming completed on December 23, 1949, though additional footage and retakes were filmed on January 7, 1950. Some interiors were shot at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles. Release=Box office The Furies premiered in Tucson, Arizona on July 21, 1950 before screening nationally in August 1950. Though it grossed $1,550,000 million at the U.S. box office, the film was considered a financial failure for Paramount.

She is considered to have been one of the first to systematically collect folk songs and melodies in Telemark. Olea Styhr Cr√∏ger was born in Heddal in Telemark, Norway. She was the daughter of Johannes Cr√∏ger (1753-1830) and Helle Margrethe Neumann (1764-1849). She was the daughter of a parish priest and a mother who taught her song and music. As an adult, she taught singing at Kviteseid Seminar, one of the first public teacher's college in Norway. On their own, she began to collect old folk songs and melodies. By one account, she responded to the call for citizens to collect disappearing vestiges of Norwegian folk balladry. These first appeared in Samling AF Sange, Folkeviser Og Stev I Norske Almuedialekter, the folklore collection of J√∏rgen Moe first published 1840. This material was published in an enlarged edition in 1869 which was accompanied by melodies edited by Ludvig Mathias Lindeman. However, Moe's 1840 anthology was not a bona fide ballad collection with the exception of two or three pieces, and by the time Moe met Cr√∏ger in 1842, she had already compiled a substantial collection of genuine ballads. The Norwegian ballad texts and tunes she collected in the 1840s onward were eventually published through Magnus Brostrup Landstad's Norske folkeviser (1853), which re-edited the raw ballad texts in composite form and normalized spelling. Her collected ballads also comprised a good part of Lindeman's later melody collections. The contribution by Olea Cr√∏ger as pioneer collector of folk ballad and melody had been underappreciated until the 20th century, Modern folk ballad archivist √òystein Gaukstad has analyzed this in his survey of the history of ballad collecting. The first 57 melodies in L. M. Lindeman's transcription of 1851 were essentially the melodies she collected,The 1851 Lindeman manuscripts with Cr√∏ger contributions: . 6874d, 6875c, 6875d, as were 33 of the 114 melodies appended to Landstad's Norske folkeviser (1853). When Cr√∏ger engaged in the ballad collecting, she intended her own name to appear as co-contributor to the work, but Landstad merely acknowledged her in the preface. Lindeman also stinted crediting Cr√∏ger with all but three ballads in his fifty ballad supplement of 1862, but the 1851 manuscript belies this, and Lindeman's debt to her for many more pieces is revealed. An early commentator A. P. Berggreen suspected that though Lindeman was responsible for the \\"editing\\", Cr√∏ger had done much of the \\"collecting\\".

The short was released on January 13, 1945, and features Bugs Bunny. This short, released not long before the collapse of the Third Reich, was the penultimate wartime themed cartoon from Warner Bros. (Draftee Daffy was the last) being released just under four months before Victory in Europe Day. Plot The cartoon opens with a faux Walter Winchell-like voice discussing the end of the Third Reich, saying that \\"Germany has been battered into a fare-thee-well\\", and musing about where the high leadership, and \\"Fatso\\" G√∂ring in particular has gone. The scene soon cuts to the Black Forest, where Hermann G√∂ring‚Äîin bemedalled lederhosen‚Äîis \\"soothing his jangled nerves\\" marching while on a hunt. Nearby, a furrow in the ground appears, with a hole at the end. Bugs pops out of the hole, and sees no sign of the Black Forest on his map (variants of this scene would be used in later cartoons as the lead-in to the joke that Bugs, while tunneling underground, did indeed turn wrong somewhere in New Mexico, usually by not taking a left turn at Albuquerque. This cartoon is the first time Bugs says the popular catchphrase: \\"I KNEW I ‚Äòshoulda‚Äô (should have) made ‚Äòdat‚Äô (that) left ‚Äòtoin‚Äô (turn) at ‚ÄòAlbakoikie‚Äô (Albuquerque)\\"). The other is Bugs asks G√∂ring about the directions to Las Vegas, oblivious to his location. G√∂ring is almost tricked into going to Las Vegas, but then quickly realizes, \\"Las Veegas? Why, there is no Las Veegas in Germany!\\" before he fires his musket at Bugs. Genuinely alarmed by his mistaken destination (\\"Joimany?! Yipe!\\"), Bugs hightails it. G√∂ring chases after the rabbit, trying to suck Bugs out of his hole with his musket as a plunger. A few chase gags go by in which Bugs insults the integrity of G√∂ring‚Äôs medals by bending one with his teeth. Suckered into bending one himself, G√∂ring declares them ersatz and mumbles all sorts of anti-Hitler sentiments (\\"Oh, do I hate that Hitler swine, that phony f√ºhrer, that‚Ä¶\\").Shull, Wilt (2004), p. 181‚Äì182 Bugs masquerades as Adolf Hitler after smearing on some mud, and faces the surprised G√∂ring. G√∂ring disappears off- screen in a flash to change into his Nazi uniform adorned with all sorts of medals. After the usual Nazi salute, Bugs berates him in faux German as he rips all of the medals off G√∂ring's uniform (Klooten-flooten-blooten-pooten- meirooten-tooten!), quickly followed by his belt. G√∂ring \\"kisses\\" in reverence, saying, \\"Look! I kiss mein F√ºhrer‚Äôs hand. I kiss right in 'der F√ºhrer‚Äôs face!'\\" (the joke being a popular near-contemporary song with this title composed by Oliver Wallace and the subject of a Disney animated short in 1943). Afterwards, G√∂ring exclaims \\"Oh, I‚Äôm a bad flooten-boy-glooten!\\", a variant on Warner Bros. cartoons' frequently-cited Lou Costello-type catchphrase: \\"I'm a bad boy!\\". Later, when the jig is up, Bugs rides in on a white horse, dressed as Br√ºnhilde‚Äîfrom Wagnerian opera, to the tune of the \\"Pilgrims‚Äô Chorus\\" from Tannh√§user. Entranced, G√∂ring responds by dressing up as Siegfried. The two dance, before Bugs once again makes a fool of G√∂ring and escapes (anticipating What's Opera, Doc? co-starring Elmer Fudd).Goldmark (2005), pp. 143‚Äì145. Eventually, G√∂ring gets a hawk to capture Bugs. Bugs, standing next to G√∂ring asks, \\"Do you think he‚Äôll catch me, doc?\\" to which G√∂ring replies, \\"Do I think he'll catch you? Why, he‚Äôll have you back here before you can say Schicklgruber.\\" (Schicklgruber was the original surname of Hitler‚Äôs father Alois.) Bugs runs off and jumps into his rabbit hole, but as he falls down the hole, the hawk, which imitates Jimmy Durante, catches Bugs in a bag, capturing him. G√∂ring brings the bag to Hitler, who plays solitaire in front of a map depicting the decline of Fortress Europe. G√∂ring identifies the captive in the bag as \\"Bugsenheimer Bunny\\" (as opposed to \\"Weisenheimer\\", or \\"wise guy\\") to der F√ºhrer.During this final sequence, realistic hand prints are visible on a wall map. These prints represent a signature of background artist Robert Gribbroek, who is not credited in this cartoon. As Herr Hitler talks of the great rewards he‚Äôs going to pile upon G√∂ring for this act of heroism, he peeks inside the bag and is shocked (\\"Ach!! Himmel!\\"). G√∂ring goes and looks inside the bag as well, to be shocked as well (again, \\"Ach!! Himmel!\\"). Out of the bag comes Bugs dressed as Joseph Stalin‚Äîcomplete with an enormous pipe and a large moustache‚Äîstaring back at them. As the cartoon ends, Bugs glances back at the camera and asks, in a Russian accent: \\"Does your tobacco taste different lately?\\", citing an ad slogan of that era for the Sir Walter Raleigh pipe tobacco manufactured by the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company.

Cartoons name, as Schlesinger sold the studio to Warner Bros. the previous year. Bugs dresses as Hitler to assert control over his German opponent. This is a repetition of a scene from Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips, in which Bugs dresses up as a Japanese general.Lerner (2010), p. 220 Daniel Goldmark cites the cartoon as a significant precursor to What's Opera, Doc? (1957) and a source for its visual imagery. After running off, Bugs re-enters the scene dressed as Br√ºnnhilde. The costume includes a blonde wig with braids and a Viking-style helmet. Bugs rides on a white horse, visually based on the Clydesdale horse. Musically, the scene is accompanied by the \\"Pilgrim‚Äôs Chorus\\" from the Tannh√§user (1845). In response, Hermann G√∂ring changes clothes. His lederhosen is replaced by a long brown loincloth. He wears a horned-type Viking helmet. The horns grow in size as if erect, as he lustfully gazes at \\"Br√ºnnhilde\\". The duo dances to the tune of two waltzes by Johann Strauss II: \\"Vienna Life\\" and \\"You and You\\", the latter originating in Die Fledermaus (1874). The entry of Bugs and his white horse into the scene is repeated in What‚Äôs Opera, Doc?. The dance with the male suitor is, however, changed from a slapstick-rendition of the waltz to a refined ballet. The motivation of the dancers also changes. G√∂ring is \\"lost in the moment\\" and follows his partner's lead. In the latter, the dance is part of an artistic performance. Both cartoons were written by Michael Maltese, which may account for the similarities. In the older short, the musical references were intended as a criticism of Germany, Richard Wagner serving as \\"a suitable musical backdrop\\". The second short makes Wagner and opera itself as its targets. Reception Like other American animated cartoons, Herr Meets Hare was available to German prisoners of war in the United States, some of whom did not like it; Hans Goebler said: \\"You saw Hermann G√∂ring standing there full of decorations, then all of a sudden a rabbit showed up and took all the decorations off, and stuff like that. And we didn‚Äôt care for that.\\"Waters, Michael R., Mark Long, and William Dickens. Lone Star Stalag: German Prisoners of War at Camp Hearne. 2004, Texas A&M; University Press. , page 27. As with many of the World War II‚Äìthemed cartoons put out by the major studios, Herr Meets Hare was placed under an unofficial ban from broadcast or video distribution by Warner Bros. and other rights-holders (including Turner Broadcasting and AOL Time Warner). In 2001, Cartoon Network had planned on showing each and every Bugs Bunny cartoon made so far as part of its yearly \\"June Bugs\\" festival. AOL Time Warner refused to allow the broadcast of Herr Meets Hare, on the grounds that the cartoon was offensive (by today's standards) as it dealt with the Nazis in a joking manner. The cartoon saw limited broadcast on a special one-hour episode of ToonHeads about cartoons from World War II. It has also appeared on Turner Classic Movies‚Äô Cartoon Alley as recently as January 20, 2007. In 2008, it was released to DVD on the set Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 6.

Background In 1909, the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway Company was incorporated by an Act of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. Another Act was passed in the same year to authorize the Province to guarantee the principal and interest of bonds that were to be issued by the Company. The proceeds of the bonds raised in England were credited to a Railway Special Account set up by the province and kept in a branch of the Royal Bank of Canada in Edmonton, and the Company proceeded to enter into a contract with the Canada West Construction Company. In 1910, public uneasiness was raised concerning the arrangements that had been entered into by the Province, and a commission of inquiry was set up to look into the matter. While the commission was deliberating, a new government was formed that proceeded to pass two new Actsthe first authorizing the transfer of the balance in the Railway Special Account into the General Revenue Fund of the Province on the basis that the company had defaulted on the construction of the railway, and the second providing that anyone suffering loss or damage under the first Act must file a claim with the Government that would be reported to the Legislature. When the Provincial Treasurer arranged to issue a cheque to draw the balance out of the special account, the Royal Bank of Canada refused to honour it. The Province then proceeded to sue the Bank for the funds, and the two Companies were joined in the action as defendants. The courts below At first instance, the District Court of Northern Alberta, Stuart J. ruled that the proceeds of the bond issue were within the Province, and therefore the matter was one of a local nature in it. Accordingly, the Act was validly passed and judgment was issued in favour of the Province. The judgment was upheld by the Supreme Court of Alberta in a unanimous decision. Appeal to the Privy Council Appeal was allowed by the Privy Council, which noted that the law in this field provided that the lenders in London were entitled to claim from the Bank at its head office in Montreal the money which they had advanced for a purpose that had ceased to exist.as stated in Wilson v Church (13 Ch. D. 1, at p. 29), the principle being subsequently affirmed by the House of Lords in The National Bolivian Navigation Company v Wilson (1880) (5 AC 176) Therefore, this was a civil right that existed outside the Province of Alberta, and the Legislature of Alberta could not legislate validly against it. Aftermath The absolute rule in Royal Bank of Canada v R has since been relaxed somewhat by Re Upper Churchill Water Rights Reversion ActRe Upper Churchill Water Rights Reversion Act , to allow for incidental effects, where, as noted by McIntyre J.: See also * List of Judicial Committee of the Privy Council cases References Category:1913 in Canadian case law Category:Canadian constitutional case law Category:Judicial Committee of the Privy Council cases on appeal from Canada Category:Royal Bank of Canada ","title":"Royal Bank of Canada v R"},{"id":"3769390","text":"KBUL (970 AM, \\"News Radio 970 AM\\") is an American talk radio station that broadcasts in the Billings Metro Area of the U.S. state of Montana.

In terms of the associated equivalence relation on X, G-invariance means that :x ~ y implies gx ~ gy for all g ‚àà G and all x, y ‚àà X. The action of G on X induces a natural action of G on any block system for X. The set of orbits of the G-set X is an example of a block system. The corresponding equivalence relation is the smallest G-invariant equivalence on X such that the induced action on the block system is trivial. The partition into singleton sets is a block system and if X is non-empty then the partition into one set X itself is a block system as well (if X is a singleton set then these two partitions are identical). A transitive (and thus non-empty) G-set X is said to be primitive if it has no other block systems. For a non-empty G-set X the transitivity requirement in the previous definition is only necessary in the case when X=2 and the group action is trivial. Characterization of blocks Each element of some block system is called a block. A block can be characterized as a non-empty subset B of X such that for all g ‚àà G, either *gB = B (g fixes B) or *gB ‚à© B = ‚àÖ (g moves B entirely). Proof: Assume that B is a block, and for some g ‚àà G it's gB ‚à© B ‚â† ‚àÖ. Then for some x ‚àà B it's gx ~ x. Let y ‚àà B, then x ~ y and from the G-invariance it follows that gx ~ gy. Thus y ~ gy and so gB ‚äÜ B. The condition gx ~ x also implies x ~ g‚àí1x, and by the same method it follows that g‚àí1B ‚äÜ B, and thus B ‚äÜ gB. In the other direction, if the set B satisfies the given condition then the system {gB  g ‚àà G} together with the complement of the union of these sets is a block system containing B. In particular, if B is a block then gB is a block for any g ‚àà G, and if G acts transitively on X then the set {gB  g ‚àà G} is a block system on X. Stabilizers of blocks If B is a block, the stabilizer of B is the subgroup :GB = { g ‚àà G  gB = B }. The stabilizer of a block contains the stabilizer Gx of each of its elements. Conversely, if x ‚àà X and H is a subgroup of G containing Gx, then the orbit H.x of x under H is a block contained in the orbit G.x and containing x. For any x ‚àà X, block B containing x and subgroup H ‚äÜ G containing Gx it's GB.x = B ‚à© G.x and GH.x = H. It follows that the blocks containing x and contained in G.x are in one-to-one correspondence with the subgroups of G containing Gx. In particular, if the G-set X is transitive then the blocks containing x are in one-to-one correspondence with the subgroups of G containing Gx. In this case the G-set X is primitive if and only if either the group action is trivial (then X = {x}) or the stabilizer Gx is a maximal subgroup of G (then the stabilizers of all elements of X are the maximal subgroups of G conjugate to Gx because Ggx = g ‚ãÖ Gx ‚ãÖ g‚àí1).

It is a popular pastime in Australia and New Zealand. It can be a dangerous pastime and claims many lives each year, although this may improve as more fishermen are beginning to wear life jackets. Dangers According to Surf Life Saving Australia's 2009 Coastal Report, there were 94 drownings on the coast of Australia, for the year to July 2009. Of those deaths 12 were related to fishing. The Randwick Council area in Sydney NSW, is the National black spot for rock fishing deaths, with 10 in the past 5 years.Preventing coastal drownings in Australia National Coastal Safety Report 2009. Techniques Tranquil rock fishing in Israel Shihtiping in Taiwan Rock fishing can be done with a rod and reel and line, or a line only. Both ground and surface fishing are generally successful methods. Rock fishing can be done both with artificial lures and natural bait. While bottom fishing typically relies on natural bait, both natural bait and artificial lures are used in different forms of surface rock fishing. Some fishers who are rock fishing use an umbrella rig in spring, and use bait fish, such as perch and bluegill, in summer and autumn (the fall). Using an umbrella rig is a method of trolling. Typically, an umbrella rig consists of four plastic neon green lures with a lead dragging behind. An additional lure is attached to the lead. Only the lure behind the lead will have hooks attached because this lure can appear to a stalking fish as the wounded or sick laggard in a school, making it a more likely target. Another method of rock fishing is using bait fish. The bait fish may be bought from a store, or the angler can catch them himself. Bait fish can be used either whole or cut up into pieces. The size and type of bait fish used will vary depending what species is being targeted. Problems may arise from the fact that sea bottom areas close to a rocky water's edge often consist of jagged rocks, which can cause a sinker rig to become snagged beyond recovery and thus be lost. Conversely, surface fishing with a float or buoy is often made difficult by the fact that rocky shore areas can have strong currents, in which light floats in particular can be carried away quickly from a desired area. Spin fishing as a form of surface fishing can allow more control over a lure or bait in these conditions. Techniques in Britain right Rock Angling as the name suggests usually entails the angler fishing from a rock ledge or outcrop on the shore. This will usually allow the angler access to deeper water than from the beach, which usually means more fish. Fishing from rock ledges and outcrops can be very dangerous and should never be done alone, as anglers each year are swept off rocks by the power of the sea and some of these are swept to their deaths. An angler rock fishing will usually use a rod of between 10 and 11 feet when fishing from rocks although the full Beach Casters of 12 to 14 feet may be used when distance casting is required or a stiff rod is required due to rough ground. It is usual that only short casting is required from rocks to catch fish as they tend to be close in trying to feed of crabs and other animals. Again the angler may use a fixed spool reel or a multiplier reel loaded with line from as little as 8 pound (float fishing) to 30 pounds over rough ground. When fishing from rocks several different methods can be used such as bait fishing, spinning/plugging and float fishing. Bait fishing will be much the same as from the beach but the most common bait would now be peeler crab and hard back crab. Spinning/plugging involves casting an artificial lure or plug and retrieving it to induce a fish to 'take' attack the lure or plug. Whilst float fishing is simply suspending a bait usually a rag worm, sand eel of prawn below a float. The species of fish targeted will be the same as from the beach but will include species such as Ballan Wrasse. Species varie from coast to coast, but the main species from rock marks are conger eels, various species of ray, tope, cod, bass and bullhuss. A rotten bottom system is commonly used among professional anglers looking to cut down on tackle losses due to rocky snags.

Playing for Santa Barbara High School, he was selected as the CIF Player of the Year in 1953 and went on to play at the halfback position for the USC Trojans in 1955 and 1956. Between 1962 and 1975, he was a college football coach at Allan Hancock Junior College (1962‚Äì1965), Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (1966) and San Diego State University (1967‚Äì1975). Between 1976 and 1999, he served as an assistant coach, scout, assistant head coach and offensive coordinator for various NFL teams. He gained his greatest acclaim as the assistant head coach and offensive coordinator of the San Diego Chargers during the Air Coryell years. Football player=Santa Barbara High School Despite his small size (5 feet, 8 inches and 155 pounds), Zampese played tailback for Santa Barbara High School from 1951 to 1953. As a senior in 1953, Zampese rushed for 869 yards (9.3 yards per carry) and 19 touchdowns. He also passed for 1008 yards and 14 passing touchdowns. In December 1953, he was selected by the Helms Athletic Foundation's football board as the CIF Player of the Year. The Los Angeles Times called him \\"Little Ernie Zampese, a durable workhorse who did everything well for the Santa Barbara High Dons.\\" Zampese later recalled his days playing for the Dons as follows: > \\"We had a great tradition at Santa Barbara. The stadium was on the school > grounds in a little bowl. The town was much smaller then and everyone > watched the Santa Barbara Dons on Friday nights. The of success was to play > for the Santa Barbara Dons. That was as high as you could go.\\" USC Trojans After graduating from high school, Zampese enrolled at the University of Southern California. He played left halfback for the USC Trojans football team from 1955 to 1956. Zampese developed a reputation as a colorful character at USC. In a 1987 feature story, the Los Angeles Times wrote of Zampese in his college days, \\"Zampese was a work of art, or so the legend goes, a guy who could paint the town Trojan Red at night and be seen whistling at sunrise the next morning, a Daily Racing Form folded under his arm, a soda in one hand and a cigarette in the other. Let's just say he wasn't headed for biology class.\\" He had his best season for the Trojans as a junior in 1956. In the Trojans' final pre-season game in September 1956, Zampese scored two rushing touchdowns and returned a punt 66 yards. Zampese's performance led sports writer Braven Dyer to write, \\"A lightweight named Ernie Zampese stole the show ... Weighing less than the 160 pounds credited to him on Troy's roster, the slick Santa Barbara speedster sparked the so-called second varsity unit ...\\" In addition to playing halfback, Zampese was also the punter for the 1956 Trojans team and was among the national leaders with an average of 43.9 yards per punt. He set the USC record for longest punt, 85 yards against Wisconsin. In his final college football game, Zampese ran 38 yards for a touchdown in the fourth quarter to give the Trojans a 28-20 win over Notre Dame at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The Los Angeles Times concluded its coverage of the game with a tribute to Zampese, \\"Troy had the final word, though, and came up with the clutch play on Zampese's 38-yard run 46 seconds into the final period. Clutch? You bet! It was fourth and 1 on the Notre Dame 38 when Ernie decided to be a hero.\\" Zampese was barred from competition in 1957 due to Pacific Coast Conference penalties against USC. Zampese and other players had part-time jobs which were determined to be in violation of NCAA rules. Zampese later recalled that the part-time job that cost him his eligibility as a senior was sweeping leaves for $1.50 an hour. Zampese later recalled, \\"We did that to get extra money because you could hardly survive on what the Pacific Coast Conference allowed for scholarships. I had to report to a groundskeeper and do whatever he did.\\" Having been ruled ineligible for the 1957 season, Zampese did not complete his degree at USC. He later recalled having academic problems in his senior year: \\"The thing that happened my last semester was that I never went to class. I took Incompletes and they turned to F's, and I blew the whole thing off. At that time, I wasn't real interested and I had no direction, other than having fun.\\" Ottawa Rough Riders In June 1958, Zampese signed a contract to play professional football for the Ottawa Rough Riders in the Canadian Football League, reportedly for $9,000. He was cut by the Rough Riders in August 1958. Football coach=Cal Poly and Hancock College After being cut by the Ottawa Roughriders in the summer of 1958, Zampese took a job driving a sugar beet truck in Bakersfield, California. He then took a job as a postman in Santa Barbara, where he was married to his wife, Joyce. He later recalled that his wife straightened him out and urged him to return to college so that he could pursue his dream of becoming a football coach. Zampese enrolled at Cal Poly and received a degree in physical education. He recalled, \\"For the first time, I sat down and really did the work. I was really proud of myself. The first year I ended up with a 3.0 average and, boy, that was big stuff.\\" Zampese got his start in coaching in 1962 when he was hired by John Madden as the backfield coach at Allan Hancock Junior College in Santa Maria, California. Zampese became the head coach at Hancock in 1964 after John Madden left to join Don Coryell's coaching staff at San Diego State University. The brief stint as head coach at Hancock proved to be Zampese's only head coaching experience. Zampese later noted, \\"I did it once, and I wasn't good at it. Why? I don't know. I don't like to be the out-front guy. I'm not comfortable in that position.\\" In 1966, Zampese moved to Cal Poly as the backfield coach. San Diego State In June 1967, he was hired by San Diego State head coach Don Coryell as his defensive backfield coach; Zampese replaced Madden, who resigned to join the Oakland Raiders staff. He remained an assistant coach at San Diego State from 1967 to 1975 and was one of two assistant coaches to retain his job after Coryell resigned in 1973 to join the St. Louis Cardinals. Zampese recalled that his years as an assistant coach at San Diego State was his first exposure to a great passing attack. San Diego Chargers He began his NFL coaching career in 1976 as the defensive backs coach for head coach Tommy Prothro of the San Diego Chargers. He spent the 1977 and 1978 seasons as a scout for the New York Jets. In March 1979, Zampese was reunited with Don Coryell as the wide receivers coach for the San Diego Chargers. He coached the receivers, including Hall of Famers Charlie Joiner and Kellen Winslow, from 1979 to 1983. In 1981, the Los Angeles Times published a feature story giving the little- known Zampese much of the credit for the famed Air Coryell offense of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Times feature appeared under the headline, \\"Zampese Puts Air in Coryell Attack\\", and portrayed Zampese as a behind-the-scenes strategist sitting in a cubbyhole and speaking in an incomprehensible jargon. Zampese explained his approach to the passing game as follows: > \\"Everybody uses basically the same pass patterns. Philosophy varies in the > formations you throw from. We have a lot of formations and movements. When > you move like we do, you get constant movement from the defense. We have to > do a lot of adjusting and reading on the move. ... There's no question our > movement is confusing. Our movement can change the strength of a formation > from strong left to strong right. We like to eliminate the pre-snap thought > and anticipation by the defense. It's a game of matchups, and our formations > are primarily predicated on certain matchups.\\" In 1983, Zampese was promoted to assistant head coach in charge of the passing game. In 1985, the Chargers shuffled assignments, with Zampese losing the title of assistant head coach and becoming offensive coordinator. The Los Angeles Times in December 1985 wrote the following about Zampese's new role: > \\"Fortunately for morale, Zampese is not the type to worry about what he is > called. For that matter, he probably did not even know that he was assistant > head coach and undoubtedly does not care that he is now a mere offensive > coordinator. If he knows. Zampese's only interest is in designing a high- > octane offense. All he needs is a blackboard and a projector. He does not > need a desk and he cares not what it says on the door. He could work in a > cave on Mt. Laguna and be happy.\\" During Zampese's years with the Chargers, they consistently ranked among the top offensive teams in the NFL. The team ranked first in passing offense six times in seven years from 1979 to 1985 and ranked first or second in total offense four times during the same span. The Chargers' 1982 average of 325.2 passing yards per game, still ranks as the highest average in NFL history. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" - ! bgcolor=\\"#F8E616\\" width=\\"12%\\"  Year ! bgcolor=\\"#F8E616\\" width=\\"22%\\"  Position ! bgcolor=\\"#F8E616\\" width=\\"13%\\"  Points/game ! bgcolor=\\"#F8E616\\" width=\\"13%\\"  Passing yards ! bgcolor=\\"#F8E616\\" width=\\"11%\\"  Pass yds/game ! bgcolor=\\"#F8E616\\" width=\\"11%\\"  Passing offense rank ! bgcolor=\\"#F8E616\\" width=\\"11%\\"  Scoring offense rank - align=\\"center\\" 1979 Wide receivers  25.7  3915  244.7  1  2 - align=\\"center\\" 1980 Wide receivers  26.1  4531  283.2  1  4 - align=\\"center\\" 1981 Wide receivers  29.9  4739  296.2  1  1 - align=\\"center\\" 1982 Wide receivers  32.0  2927  325.2  1  1 - align=\\"center\\" 1983 Asst. head coach  22.4  4661  291.3  1  12 - align=\\"center\\" 1984 Asst. head coach  24.6  4643  290.2  2  6 - align=\\"center\\" 1985 Offensive coordinator  29.2  4870  304.4  1  1 - align=\\"center\\" 1986 Offensive coordinator  20.9  3780  236.3  7 15 - align=\\"center\\" } Los Angeles Rams In February 1987, Zampese signed as offensive coordinator of the Los Angeles Rams. Rams head coach John Robinson had earlier been asked who he would most like to start a new coaching staff with, and without hesitation Robinson named Zampese. Zampese was described at the time as an \\"offensive genius\\" and \\"one of the most likable and most respected coaches in the league.\\" Zampese spent seven years with the Rams from 1987 to 1993. Zampese took an offense that was ranked 17th in the league before he arrived, and turned it into the third best scoring offense in the NFL in 1988 and second best in 1989. His Rams' teams ranked among the top 7 in passing offense four straight years from 1988 to 1991. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" - ! bgcolor=\\"#F8E616\\" width=\\"15%\\"  Year ! bgcolor=\\"#F8E616\\" width=\\"29%\\"  Position ! bgcolor=\\"#F8E616\\" width=\\"17%\\"  Points ! bgcolor=\\"#F8E616\\" width=\\"13%\\"  Passing yards ! bgcolor=\\"#F8E616\\" width=\\"11%\\"  Passing offense rank ! bgcolor=\\"#F8E616\\" width=\\"11%\\"  Scoring offense rank - align=\\"center\\" 1987 Offensive coordinator  317  2554  27  16 - align=\\"center\\" 1988 Offensive coordinator  407  3805  3  3 - align=\\"center\\" 1989 Offensive coordinator  426  4133  4  2 - align=\\"center\\" 1990 Offensive coordinator  345  3818  3  12 - align=\\"center\\" 1991 Offensive coordinator  234  3410  7  24 - align=\\"center\\" 1992 Offensive coordinator  313  3218  10  12 - align=\\"center\\" 1993 Offensive coordinator  221  2790  23  26 - align=\\"center\\" } Dallas Cowboys From 1994 to 1997, he was the offensive coordinator for the Dallas Cowboys. In his first year in Dallas, the Cowboys' offense finished second in the NFL in scoring with an average of 25.9 points per game.

Until February 1936, the official name was Kazak Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic (), abbreviated as Kazakh ASSR () and simply Kazakhstan (). History The Kazakh ASSR was originally created as the Kirghiz ASSR (not to be confused with Kirghiz ASSR of 1926‚Äì1936, a Central Asian territory which is now the independent state of Kyrgyzstan) on 26 August 1920, and was a part of the RSFSR.

However, on 15‚Äì19 June 1925 the Fifth Kazakh Council of Soviets decided to rename the republic the Kazak Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic. The capital of the former Kirghiz ASSR, Ak-Mechet, was retained as the seat of the Kazak ASSR but was renamed Kzyl- Orda, from the Kazakh \\"red centre\\". In 1927 or 1929Vladimir Babak, et al., eds. Political Organization in Central Asia and Azerbaijan: Sources and Documents. Routledge, 2004. p. 90. the city of Alma-Ata was designated as the new capital of the ASSR. In February 1930, there was an anti-Soviet insurgency in the village of Sozak. On 5 December 1936, the ASSR was detached from the RSFSR and made the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, a full union republic of the Soviet Union. Geography The Kazak ASSR that succeeded the recently expanded Kirghiz ASSR included all of the territory making up the present-day Republic of Kazakhstan plus parts of Uzbekistan (the Karakalpak Autonomous Oblast), Turkmenistan (the north shore of Kara-Bogaz-Gol) and Russia (parts of what would become Orenburg Oblast). These territories were transferred from the Kazak ASSR over the following decade. The administrative subdivisions of the ASSR changed several times in its history. In 1928 the guberniyas, administrative districts inherited from the Kirghiz ASSR were eliminated and replaced with 13 okrugs and raions. In 1932, the republic was divided into six new larger oblasts. These included: *Aktyubinsk Oblast (capital: Aktyubinsk); *Alma-Ata (capital: Alma-Ata); *East Kazak Oblast (capital: Semipalatinsk); *Karaganda Oblast (capital: Petropavlovsk); *South Kazak Oblast (capital: Chimkent); *West Kazak Oblast (capital: Uralsk). On 31 January 1935, yet another territorial division was implemented which included the six oblasts listed above plus a new Karkaralinsk okrug.–ü–æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –í–¶–ò–ö –æ—Ç 31.01.1935 ¬´–û –Ω–æ–≤–æ–º –∞–¥–º–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ-—Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–º –¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –ö–∞–∑–∞–∫—Å–∫–æ–π –ê–°–°–†¬ª.

Among his best known paintings are Haugianerne (The Haugeans; 1852) and Brudeferd i Hardanger (The Bridal Procession in Hardanger; 1848), painted in collaboration with Hans Gude. Biography Adolph Tidemand was born in Mandal, Norway as the son of customs inspector and Storting representative Christen Tidemand (1779‚Äì1838) and Johanne Henriette Henrikke Haste (1779‚Äì1859). He received private art lessons in his home town and his talent was soon recognized. He then was enrolled in an art school in Christiania, moving on to Copenhagen in the period 1832‚Äì1837. Upon arrival in Copenhagen, he was rejected by the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and studied at a private school of art, but by 1833 he was a pupil at the Academy, earning Academy exhibitions in 1835 and 1836. He studied there for five years and then began a journey to Italy to study further. But when Tidemand came to D√ºsseldorf, Germany, he liked it so much that he settled down there. From 1837 until 1841 he continued his studies at the art academy in D√ºsseldorf, which at the time enjoyed widespread international recognition. He studied with and was influenced by his teacher, Theodor Hildebrandt. Here he prepared the well known Hjemvendte fiskere ved den sj√¶llandske kyst (1838). The painting Gustav Vasa taler til dalalmuen i Mora kirke (1841) was sold to a German museum, but was later returned to Christiania. He is associated with the D√ºsseldorf school of painting. In the autumn of 1841 he studied in Italy along with his brother Emil. Few of his works from this period remain, except for the picture Napolitansk fisker (1842). Tidemand was preoccupied by Norwegian history, particularly after returning on a journey to Norway. During a journey to 1843 in Hardanger, he met the 18-year-old Hans Gude. This resulted in a close friendship, and eventually they collaborated on several landscape paintings in which Tidemand painted the figures. Haugianerne Low Church Devotion (The Haugeans. 1852) During 1842‚Äì1845 he traveled extensively in Norway (to √òsterdalen, Gudbrandsdalen, Sogn, Hardanger and Telemark). More of his works survive from this period, including Eventyrfortellersken (1844), S√∏ndagskveld i en hardangersk r√∏kstue (1843) and Gudstjeneste i en norsk landsens kirke (1845). In his later travels in southern Norway, the last in 1875, Tidemand studied folk costumes, domestic utensils and building and made himself familiar with oral traditions, folk tales and legends. His version of rusticity proved highly popular and in 1848 he was commissioned by Oscar I, King of Sweden and Norway, to paint a series of Norwegian peasant life for the royal palace of Oscarshall, near Christiania. Today Adolph Tidemand is best known for this depiction of Norwegian farm and culture and is counted among the first Norwegian historic painters. In Tidemand‚Äôs paintings of the old Norwegian farm culture, he portrayed the peasant with a new dignity, humane and culturally. The National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design (Nasjonalgalleriet) in Oslo alone owns more than 100 of his works. Personal life He married in 1845 with his childhood sweetheart, Claudine Marie Bergitte J√¶ger (1817‚Äì1887). The couple settled in D√ºsseldorf in 1845. Their only child, a son, Adolph, died in 1874 at 28 years of age. Tidemand was awarded the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav (Den Kongelige Norske St. Olavs Orden) in 1849, the French Legion of Honor (L√©gion d'honneur) in 1855 and the Swedish Order of the Polar Star (Nordstj√§rneorden) in 1866.

Dustin Vu. History Blessed John XXIII parish was created on September 3, 2000 in a ceremony led by Archbishop Jerome Hanus, OSB, at a ceremony at Taft Middle School. The parish was created in response to a growing number of Catholics in the southwest portion of the city, and to provide for people living in surrounding areas as well. For the first three years and five months, the parish hosted Masses at Taft Middle School. During this time a combined building with church, school, meeting spaces, offices, and kitchen facilities was designed by Novak Design Group. The building was built by Kleiman Construction Company. Archbishop Hanus consecrated the new church on February 1, 2004. The parish has indicated that they eventually plan to build a larger church structure adjoining the current building in a few years.

City Park is approximately 50% larger than Central Park in New York City, the municipal park recognized by Americans nationwide as the archetypal urban greenspace. Although it is an urban park whose land is owned by the City of New Orleans, it is administered by the City Park Improvement Association, an arm of state government, not by the New Orleans Parks and Parkways Department. City Park is unusual in that it is a largely self-supporting public park, with most of its annual budget derived from self-generated revenue through user fees and donations. In the wake of the enormous damage inflicted upon the park due to Hurricane Katrina, the Louisiana Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism began to partially subsidize the park's operations. City Park holds the world's largest collection of mature live oak trees, some older than 600 years in age. The park was founded in 1854, making it the 48th oldest park in the country, and established as the \\"City Park\\" in 1891. History=The Dueling Oaks Live Oak trees, located near City Park Avenue in the oldest section of the park. The park was originally a location used for dueling. In the 1800s, men would defend their pride and honor by dueling each other under the oaks at what is now City Park but then was a normally quiet spot secluded from the rest of the city. Originally, there were two \\"dueling oaks,\\" but one was lost in a hurricane in 1949. Some of the city's most notable figures who participated in duels in City Park include Bernard de Marigny, a nobleman and president of the Louisiana Senate in 1822-23. Many of the disputes between parties were either reconciled before the duel or after one party sustained a minor injury. Dueling deaths were reported, however. In 1805, Micajah Green Lewis, Gov. William C.C. Claiborne's private secretary and brother-in-law, was killed by Robert Sterry, a Claiborne opponent. By 1890, dueling was outlawed. New Orleans City Park lost approximately 2,000 trees after Hurricane Katrina and the federal levee failures, but the Dueling Oak still stands where Dueling Oaks Drive meets Dreyfous Drive between the Sydney and Walda Besthoff Sculpture Garden and the New Orleans Museum of Art. There‚Äôs a small sign in front of it. Park history City Park was established in the mid-19th century on land fronting Metairie Road (now City Park Avenue), along the remains of Bayou Metairie, a former distributary of the Mississippi River. The tract of land, formerly the Allard Plantation, became city property in 1850 through John McDonogh's will and was reserved for park purposes. In 1854, the 4th District Court pronounced the property a public park. The park originally extended 100 acres back from City Park Avenue, as swampland covered most of the landscape between Bayou Metairie and the south shore of Lake Pontchartrain. This area, to the north of the original park, was actually platted for streets by city planners, though none was ever realized. In 1891, the City Park Improvement Association is founded, and the property was officially established as \\"City Park.\\" Canoe recreation in City Park Lagoon about 1900 The carousel, originally mule-driven, opened in 1897, and was updated to a mechanical carousel in 1906. The miniature train opened in 1898 and the original golf course was built in 1902. A racetrack opened February 11, 1905, but closed only 3 years later in 1908. In the first two decades of the 20th century, numerous improvements were undertaken by the City Park Improvement Association. The Peristyle was constructed in 1907 and the Isaac Delgado Museum of Art, later renamed the New Orleans Museum of Art, opened in 1911. Two years later, in 1913, the Casino building opened offering refreshments. The Casino building is currently occupied by Cafe Du Monde. The Popp Bandstand was constructed in 1917 and dedicated on July 4. The Irby swimming pool was built in 1924. City Park's governing board also accomplished a number of large land acquisitions, such that the park assumed its current boundaries. In 1915, the Gen. Beauregard Equestrian Statue was erected at the entrance to City Park. On June 24, 2015, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu acknowledged the impact of the June 2015 Charleston church shooting, and called for the removal of several city memorials to Confederate slaveholders. On December 17, 2015, the New Orleans City Council voted 6-1 to remove the Gen. Beauregard statue, along with three other historical monuments; the Beauregard statue was removed on May 16, 2017. In 1919, William McFadden purchased property on the park and built a mansion. In 1949, this mansion began to be used as Christian Brothers School, an all-boys middle school for grades 5-7, and still remains a boys' school today. In 1927, the city extended the park by 900 acres, and the first tennis courts were built in the following year. In 1928, John Philip Sousa performed at the Popp bandstand. The park was expanded in the 1930s due to a $12 million grant from the Works Progress Administration. A master plan, by Bennett, Parsons & Frost of Chicago was commissioned to guide the development of the greatly enlarged park; this plan was largely implemented in the 1930s by the W.P.A. This included the installation of many sculptures by WPA artist Enrique Alf√©rez, construction of buildings, bridges, roads, and much of the electrical and plumbing infrastructure that were still serving the park when Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005. A formal rose garden was developed, the genesis of today's New Orleans Botanical Garden. The WPA also planted Couterie Forest and constructed Popp Fountain, City Park Stadium, a second 18-hole golf course - home for many years to the New Orleans Open golf tournament - and a golf clubhouse, which was later partially demolished to accommodate I-610. Many events have taken place at Tad Gormley Stadium in City Park. Actress Dorothy Lamour from New Orleans traveled the country selling war bonds, and in 1942, made a stop in her hometown to sell war bonds in Tad Gormley stadium. Bob Hope performed in the stadium in 1944. Roy Rogers and Trigger appeared in the stadium in 1959. Even the Beatles performed in the stadium in 1964, and tickets costed just $5. In 1992, Tad Gormley Stadium was remodeled to host the US Olympic Track & Field Trials. After World War II, two additional 18-hole golf courses were added, I-610 was constructed through the park, a new golf clubhouse was erected, the Wisner Foundation subsidized the development of a scenic parkway running almost the entire length of Bayou St. John (Wisner Boulevard), and multiple rounds of expansion and improvement occurred involving various park facilities. By the 1970s, City Park featured four 18-hole golf courses, over 50 tennis courts, numerous other athletic fields and facilities, and the newly expanded New Orleans Museum of Art. However, as was the case with many urban parks during this period, City Park began to suffer neglect, the result of insufficient maintenance due to budget cuts. Towards the end of this period the Friends of City Park were formed (1979) to rally support and raise resources for the park. The first City Park Big Bass Fishing Rodeo took place in the park in 1946. In 1960, 593 fishermen from around the country participated in the rodeo. Until 1958, two years after Storyland opened, all park amenities, including the playground and Storyland, were restricted to white residents. African American children and families were banned from entering the park. Aerial view from above City Park after Katrina. New Orleans Museum of Art is at center right. New Orleans Fairgrounds can be seen in distance at top left. Since 1999, City Park has been the venue for the Voodoo Experience, which has become the largest of the live music events held in the park. Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 did $43 million in damage to the park, with winds toppling an estimated 1,000 trees and damaging many more. The subsequent failure of multiple floodwalls brought about the inundation of much of the city, and 95% of the park was flooded with to of water that remained for two to four weeks, damaging all buildings, amusement rides, maintenance equipment, electrical systems and vehicles, and causing the death of more trees and landscaping - including nearly the entire plant collection in the New Orleans Botanical Garden. About 75,000 local and national volunteers assisted in repair projects that began in 2005. As of 2017, City Park is administered and being redeveloped according to its 2005 master plan, the existence of which proved invaluable to the effective channeling of rebuilding assistance in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The park has recovered since Hurricane Katrina with the facilities having reopened and many new attractions being added, including a water park coming soon and many future plans such as a skate park and an Environmental Education Center. A dedicated bikeway was added between Wisner Boulevard and Bayou St. John for the length of the parkway, another was installed between Bayou St. John and Marconi Drive along the park's northern boundary, and a third was introduced alongside Harrison Avenue. Most recently, a landscaped walk debuted surrounding Big Lake, adjacent to the New Orleans Museum of Art. This new amenity, called for in the park's 2005 master plan, has realized the long-held wish of surrounding neighborhoods for a pedestrian- and bicycle-only scenic walk akin to the popular facility long offered in Audubon Park, Uptown.

The principal cave is one of the country's finest, best known, and most popular tourist caves and attracts many visitors from overseas. Although the extensive system of tunnels and chambers go on for over , only about a quarter of this is open to visitors, who may proceed into the cave only in groups supervised by a guide.

Manual of South African Geography: Forming a Companion to the Map of South Africa to 16¬∞ South Latitude. Cape Town: S. Solomon. p. 161. The chamber he first was lowered down into was found to be as long as a football field, and is named Van Zyl Hall in his honor. Further exploration was done and a second chamber discovered in 1792. The caves soon became a popular place to visit.Robert Gray, 1856. Three Months' Visitation, by the Bishop of Capetown, in the Autumn of 1855. London: Bell & Daldy. pp. 70-73. A.J.H. Goodwin, an archaeologist at the University of Cape Town, carried out a test excavation in the Cango Caves in 1930 which found stone artefacts and other cultural material. The Cango Caves Ordinance of 1971 gave certain legal powers over the caves to what was then the Administrator of the Cape; legally, these same powers now devolve to the local government members of the executive. However, day-to-day management of the caves is the responsibility of the municipality of Oudtshoorn. Legends of the caves Mr. Johnny van Wassenaer, the cave‚Äôs first official guideBurman, Jose (1981). The Little Karoo, p114-124, Human & Rousseau Publishers (Pty. Ltd.), Cape Town. is purported to have walked 29 hours to find the end of the caves in 1898. When there, he is said to have calculated that he was from the entrance, and underground; his route apparently followed an underground river. So far, they are finding more and more caves to support this story.South African Speleological Society (1960). Kango, Maskew Miller Ltd., Cape Town Surveys and explorations The first rough survey was done in 1897, mapping out the first 26 chambers. In 1956 the South African Spelaeological Association was tasked to draw up an accurate mapping of the Cango Caves, and look for alternative entrances. Their results indicated that the caves were long in a single line, and that they never rise nor fell more than . These were called Cango I. The nearest point to the surface in the caves is at the top of the shaft in the Devil's Kitchen, from the floor. In 1972 James Craig- Smith, Luther Terblanche and Dart Ruiters widened an obstructed passage to discover Cango II. It stretches beyond the end of the Devil‚Äôs Kitchen. At the end of Cango II there is a shaft that descends to a chamber filled with water. This water flowed in the direction of Cango I. In August 1975, during a symposium on cave biology, an exploration team led by Hans Oosthuizen, Luther Terblanche, Michale Schultz, Digby Ellis, Jean Paul Matisse, Bob Mann, Florus Koper and Peter Breedt drained the chamber of most of its water and crawled through what was previously an underwater passage. This led to the discovery of more caves, called Cango III. Altogether these caves are about long. The biggest of the chambers, stretches about . Digby Ellis and Dave Land added to Cango III when they discovered a crawlway in December 1977. A further was added in June 1978. All these extensions were surveyed in August 1978 by Dave Land, Charles Maxwell, Brian Russell and Dave Crombie. Tourism Tours are conducted at regular intervals on most days‚Äîthere is a \\"Standard Tour\\" which takes an hour and an \\"Adventure Tour\\" which takes an hour and a half. The \\"Adventure Tour\\" consists of crawling through narrow passages and climbing up steep rock formations guided by small lights. The caves contain halls and limestone formations (on both tours) as well as small passages on the Adventure Tour. The smallest passage that tourists will have to pass through on the Adventure Tour is just under 15 cm to exit. The caves are considered to be part of the R62 road.

As one of Richmond's greatest players in the post-war ear, Clay was renowned for his versatility, aerial strength and prodigious field kicking, and was duly named in the Tigers' Team of the Century. Clay began playing football for Kyabram in the Goulburn Valley Football League, initially as a forward flanker. But after growing 15 centimetres in six months, he was developed into a key position player. Although he spent his entire VFL career at Richmond, Clay was actually signed by North Melbourne in 1964, after former player Les Mogg saw him in action in a practice match for Kyabram at Cobram. Clay kicked 116 goals for Kyabram that season and was invited to try out for North Melbourne. Clay made his VFL debut with Richmond in Round 2 of the 1966 VFL season in a win against Footscray at the MCG, lining up at centre half-forward on the great Ted Whitten. A versatile player, Clay was soon switched to the wing where he formed a revered centreline with Francis Bourke and Bill Barrot. As well as playing State of Origin for Victoria, he played in four Premiership sides ‚Äì as part of the famous centreline in 1967 and 1969, and at full-back in the back-to-back victories of 1973 and 1974. After retiring in 1976, Clay headed to the VFA where he captain-coached Prahran in 1977 before returning to Richmond where he served as Director and a member of the Match Committee in 1985. Today he has retired, and lives on the south coast of Victoria.

The mission of LIHEAP is to assist low income households, particularly those with the lowest incomes that pay a high proportion of household income for home energy, primarily in meeting their immediate home energy needs. The program, part of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is funded by grants appropriated from the federal government. Weatherization funding peaked to over 500 million dollars in 2009 and by 2014 had decreased to about 300. In 2014, it served over 80 thousand households in over 40 states, out of over 5 million in the LIHEAP program. In total since 1976, weatherization assisted over 7 million low- income households, which received free home improvements worth an average of about $5,000. The most common measures were furnace replacement, attic and wall insulation, and infiltration reduction. A random trial in Michigan estimated that the measures reduced energy consumption by 10-20 % on average.  Funding distribution  Funding is distributed to each of the fifty states, U.S. territories and tribal governments through the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Administration of the program is left up to state, territorial or tribal governments. Congress also provides the President of the United States with limited contingency funds each year, which are reserved for emergency situations and released at the President's discretion. State legislatures often provide additional appropriations each year to supplement federal LIHEAP funds. LIHEAP offers one-time financial assistance to qualifying low-income households who require support in paying their home heating or cooling bills. Applicants must have an income less than 150% of federal poverty level or 60% of state median poverty level to be eligible, however some states have expanded their programs to include more households (for example, in Massachusetts, applicants must be within 60% of the estimated State Median Income).Fiscal Year 2012 LIHEAP Annual Report The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides funding assistance to low-income households, targeting those who are truly vulnerable: the disabled, elderly, and families with preschool-age children. Funding is distributed to states or other governmental entities, who administer the program and stems from four sources including: Block grants, the Residential Energy Assistance Challenge Program, Contingency Funds, and Leveraging Incentive Programs. Allocations are based on local climate, economic, and demographic formulas. Additional funds may be available in emergency situations or as match funds when contributions are provided by local governments, private businesses, or non-profit organizations. Final distribution of funds is conducted through the program grantees, which are able to design their programs to meet consumer needs while adhering to the goals and policies of LIHEAP. In most states, the program is run on a first come-first served basis. This typically results in a rush to apply and receive assistance, because once the funding pool is empty most energy assistance offices close their doors. In some states, the legislature or governor may make a politically popular gesture of extending eligibility to additional individuals through an emergency bill or executive order, even though this may result in funds being claimed earlier in the winter season. The Home Energy Assistance Target (H.E.A.T.) program is the State of Utah's program through which funds are distributed to the target population. This program is specifically administered by the state and various Associations of Governments (AOG). The Mountain land AOG provides H.E.A.T. assistance to persons in Utah, Wasatch, and Summit Counties. Many state LIHEAP agencies also offer weatherization support, in which contractors are sent to residences to make physical changes to help retain heat or install more fuel-efficient furnaces. Occasionally, acceptance of the weatherization process is mandatory with approval for LIHEAP assistance. Some states have attempted to enact Percentage of Income Payment (PIP) plans within or in addition to the traditional LIHEAP block grant model. Although overall funding has increased since 2002, future funding may be limited due to the recent trend in cutting the budget based on building codes requiring energy efficiency, modern appliances with low energy use standards, and concerns about federal budget sustainability. As the program moves forward, the budget being cut along with the rise of applicants are the two major challenges it faces. History LIHEAP history began in 1980 when congress created the Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIEAP), as part of the Crude Oil Windfall Profits Tax Act to answer the concerns of the rising energy prices of the 1970s. In 1981, LIEAP was replaced with LIHEAP as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. In 1984, the Human Services Reauthorization Act added a new goal to provide funds for cooling costs of low-income households. Congress also required the use of more recent population and energy data, which meant the shifting of funds from solely cold-weather states to warm-weather states. Administration LIHEAP is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. Several federal divisions provide oversight and direction to the program. These include the Administration for Children and Family Services, the Office of Community Services, and the Division of Energy Assistance. The federal government does not provide LIHEAP assistance to the public. Instead, the federal government provides funds to states, federal or state-recognized Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and insular areas to administer. Groups who receive funds are considered grantees in the program. LIHEAP grantees have flexibility to design their programs, within very broad federal guidelines, to meet the needs of their citizens. Each state may have varying departments or divisions to disseminate funds. Shown above is the program flow from the federal to local level in the State of Utah. In Utah, LIHEAP funding is managed through the Home Energy Assistance Target (HEAT) program, which is handled by the state or Association of Governments (AOG). The Mountainland AOG provides direct oversight for assistance to local government agencies in Utah, Wasatch, and Summit Counties. MAG receives nearly $2.5 Million annually. State of Illinois has announced in 2014 that residents can apply at two area agencies; a single- person household can qualify with a monthly income of up to $1,459; a two- person household up to $1,966; a family of three can earn up to $2,474; and a family of four can earn up to $2,981.  Federal funding  right LIHEAP is funded by annual appropriations to the Department of Health & Human Services. The funding for the fiscal year 2017 is $3.09 billion. Funding is distributed to each of the fifty states, U.S. territories and tribal governments through the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Administration of the program is left up to state, territorial or tribal governments. Congress also provides the President of the United States with limited contingency funds each year, which are reserved for emergency situations and released at the President's discretion. State legislatures often provide additional appropriations each year to supplement federal LIHEAP funds. Funding sources The amount of funding available for actual assistance comes from four major sources including: Block grants, the Residential Energy Assistance Challenge Program, Contingency Funds, and Leveraging Incentive Programs. The following is a synopsis of how these sources tie into LIHEAP.  Block grants  Block grants account for the majority of dollars distributed for the LIHEAP program. To be granted a block grant, states, territories, Indian tribes, and tribal organizations that wish to assist low-income households in meeting the costs of home energy, may apply for a LIHEAP block grant.  Residential Energy Assistance Challenge Program (REACH)  The Residential Energy Assistance Challenge Program (REACH) \\"provides grants that fund demonstration projects to test various approaches to help low-income families reduce their energy usage and become more self- sufficient in meeting their home energy needs.\\" Local community-based agencies that implement innovative plans to help LIHEAP eligible households reduce their energy vulnerability can receive these funds. As of 2001, 54 REACH grants had been funded creating an annual budget of $6 Million, or one half of a one percent of the total funding for the LIHEAP program. These grants have been used to create weatherization materials, workshops on energy efficiency measures for homes, budget counseling, and have formed consumer cooperatives to purchase home energy. State projects run for three years, and state grantees are required to contract for third-party evaluations and to report after the conclusion of the project on the effectiveness of the approaches that they have tried.  Contingency funding  Contingency funds are funds that are released to assist with home energy needs due to emergency situations. They may be allocated to one or more grantees, or to all grantees, based on criteria appropriate to the nature of the emergency. Generally, these funds are released in response to extreme weather conditions or energy price increases. In the 1980s, contingency funding was only used twice. In the 1990s, it was used eight times, and since the year 2000 there has been a call for contingency funding every year.  Leveraging Incentive Program  The Leveraging Incentive Program is designed to reward those grantees that have acquired non-federal leveraged resources for their LIHEAP programs. It encourages grantees to look for ways to add non-federal dollars or other resources to their LIHEAP programs. Additionally, grantees are encouraged to integrate and coordinate with other energy assistance programs to provide non- federal energy assistance to low-income households who meet LIHEAP eligibility criteria. Participation in this program is optional, but if non-federal dollars are reported, the grantee can receive additional LIHEAP funds. An example of this program is to leverage a discount on wood that is negotiated by a tribal LIHEAP coordinator with a wood supplier. The amount of the discount, given to LIHEAP eligible households, would be reported as a leveraged or non-federal resource and be eligible for additional funding to the tribe.  How LIHEAP and WAP work together  Low Income Home Energy Assistance Programs (LIHEAP) and Weatherization Assistance Programs (WAP) work together to help low-income individuals and families pay energy bills and reduce energy costs. This article gives of overview of each program and describes how they work together. LIHEAP and WAP literature is also examined. Finally, a section detailing literacy in low-income consumers is included. Overview of LIEAP The mission of the Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIEAP) (also known as Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)), created in 1981, is to assist low income households, particularly those with the lowest incomes that pay a high proportion of household income for home energy, primarily in meeting their immediate home energy needs. The program, part of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), is funded by grants appropriated from the federal government. LIHEAP pays partial winter energy bills for eligible individuals and families. Payments are usually made directly to local utility companies or vendors. To be eligible, an individual's income level must not be more than 150% of the federal poverty level. The payment amount is figured according to the size and type of your home, as well as type of fuel. A press release from the Department of Health and Human Services on June 5, 2013, indicates that $187.4 million was released to states to help low-income homeowners and renters with rising energy costs. This funding supplements $3.065 billion in grants made available earlier in the year through the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). The funding serves to help families pay their heating and electricity, as well as make weather-related improvements to their homes. This helps to prevent these families from having service interruptions. George Shelton, HHS acting assistant secretary for the Administration for Children and Families, stated that high temperatures translate into high energy bills for families who are already struggling to make ends meet. Overview of the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) The United States Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) was created in 1976 to help low-income families reduce energy consumption and costs. WAP is governed by various federal regulations designed to help manage and account for the resources provided by the Department of Energy (DOE). WAP funding is derived from annual appropriations from Congress. Each year, the Senate and House Interior Appropriations committees decide how much funding to allocate to the Program. WAP technicians perform energy audits on a home to help locate efficiency problems. Once an audit is complete, the program can help by insulating walls and windows, replacing broken glass, and testing, repairing, and/or replacing combustion appliances. Like the LIHEAP, an individual's income level must be at or below 150% of the federal poverty level to be eligible for the WAP. Many state WAPs and LIHEAPs work together to provide the best energy services for low-income households. Weatherization measures may include caulking, weather- stripping, insulation, vent dampers, replacement of broken glass, repair or replacement of primary doors, and furnace tune-ups. Weatherization workers may not be able to install all the materials, but they will do the most important weatherization within the dollar limits allowed. When a home is scheduled for weatherization service, a crew will come to install the necessary materials in the home. After the work is completed, the client will be asked to sign a statement saying the work was done properly and to the client's satisfaction. Surveys have shown that weatherizing a home can significantly decrease winter heating or energy bills. Enrollment in LIHEAP and WAP LIHEAP and WAP are the cornerstones of any public energy assistance program. Often, the two programs not only work together, they automatically encompass each other. At the Montana energy assistance offices, clients are automatically enrolled in the WAP when they are enrolled in the LIHEAP. This association is fitting being that the LIHEAP and WAP are usually located in the same office. In Butte, Montana, the Energy Assistance office and Weatherization departments (which are part of the Human Resources Council, District XII) are in charge of LIHEAP and WAP. Each department offers several other programs that assist low- income individuals and families with heating and energy issues. When a client completes and turns in an application for LIHEAP, they are automatically enrolled in WAP. After the application is processed, it usually takes one to two weeks to receive financial assistance for their heating and energy bills. During this time, the applicant is contacted by the WAP department. Before a client's home can be weatherized, an auditor comes to the home to complete an energy audit. The auditor is trained to determine the most cost-efficient weatherization measures for the home. Besides working together to provide energy assistance, LIHEAP and WAP programs around the country provide information about energy conservation such as tips including replacing light bulbs with LED light bulbs and using Energy Star appliances. LIHEAP funding up to 2012 Congress appropriated $3.47 Billion toward the program in 2012. Over the past decade, funding for LIHEAP has trended closely with winter fuel prices, except for the federal fiscal years of 2009‚Äì2011, when funding leapt above the winter fuel price index tracked by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP). The President's budget proposal in 2012 significantly reduced allocation amounts to \\"return LIHEAP funding to historic levels received for 2008 prior to energy price spikes.\\" The two main reasons why the budget has been cut for 2012 is because first, the building codes now require energy efficiency, modern appliances with low energy use standards and second, overall opposition to federal spending. Changes in future funding will need to consider the efficacy of program management, energy costs, the number of recipients, and other potential sources of assistance. LIHEAP efficacy is monitored on a regular basis through its recipiency targeting index. This index quantifies the extent to which assistance eligible households are receiving LIHEAP assistance. The greatest focus of eligibility is those households with elderly, disabled, or young children. An index score above 100 indicates that LIHEAP is serving a target group of households at a rate higher than the prevalence of LIHEAP income eligible households that are members of that group. The table at right reflects the target scores from Fiscal Years (FY) 2004-2009 for households with an elderly member. The table also shows what the actual national targeting score was for FY 2004‚Äì2006. Each December, state LIHEAP grantees are required to report on the LIHEAP Grantee Survey the following data for the previous federal fiscal year: *sources of LIHEAP funds *uses of LIHEAP funds *average household benefits for assistance *maximum income cutoffs chosen by States for four-person households The data from the LIHEAP Grantee Survey are included in the LIHEAP Report to Congress. The most recent available data are for FY 2003 LIHEAP and related data are obtained from LIHEAP grantee reports and surveys, national household surveys, and other federal agencies. Much of the data are published in the department's LIHEAP Home Energy Notebook and the LIHEAP Report to Congress. Energy costs While the program administrators use the above measures and reports to understand how the program is working, there is greater concern that not enough funding is being brought into the program to stave off increases in fuel prices. The 2008 spike in funding was needed to address the sharp increase in home heating oil. The recent decrease in allocations prior to 2008 levels may not be enough to handle the continued climbing of heating costs and its effect on many households with low incomes. Recipients Not only are fuel prices continuing to increase, program recipients are on the rise. This may be illustrated in the following chart showing the increase in households served by the program in relation to the amount of LIHEAP funds allocated to the State of Utah. Some statistics of note for the State of Utah include: *SEALworks recorded that 1,619 households were shut off before coming in for HEAT assistance *HEAT program helped prevent 10,243 households, that had shut off notices, from being shut off *Almost $375,769 in regular HEAT Crisis assistance assisted 1,373 families in 2011 *The program served 18,592 families with young children in 2011 *The program assisted 10,875 elderly households to receive HEAT assistance in 2011 *The program assisted 17,947 people who have disabilities in 2011 Coordination with Outside Programs In addition to providing matching funds through the Leveraging Incentive Program, LIHEAP strives to coordinate efforts with private utility companies and non-profits where federal funding is not available.

(December 15, 1893 ‚Äì October 29, 1972) (sometimes Victor Miller) was an American cinematographer. He was nominated for ten cinematography Academy Awards, winning once for 1934 Cleopatra. Milner worked on more than 130 films, including dramas (Broken Lullaby), comedies (Unfaithfully Yours), film noir (Dark City), and Westerns (The Furies). He worked for large production companies like Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Universal, and Paramount during his film career. Early life Victor Milner was born on December 15, 1893 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. When he was 12, his family moved to New York City. As a teenager, he was sometimes put in charge of operating the projector at movies when the movie projector's girlfriend came to visit. Milner later got his projectioner's license and worked as a projectionist. In 1912, he taught Calvin Coolidge how to use a camera. Career Victor Milner, A.S.C., at Port Said in 1913 with his pioneer camera and African assistant Milner was hired by Eberhard Schneider, a film equipment manufacturer. He worked as a projectionist and also ran supply runs for Schneider. During this time, Milner shot Hiawatha: The Indian Passion Play in 1913 as his first film. In 1914, he managed to photograph a mine strike in Trinidad, Colorado. Milner was later sent to Galveston, Texas to embark on a destroyer; however his orders never arrived by mail. Instead, Milner was hired as a private photographer and was able to travel extensively, even spending nine months in the Belgian Congo taking pictures of the wildlife and people. Milner was later hired by Pathe Freres News Reel, and his first responsibility there was to film marathon races at Union Heights. As part of his job, Milner went on a world tour with the New York Giants and the Chicago White Sox. Milner was able to go on Woodrow Wilson's first campaign tour where he became acquainted with Teddy Roosevelt. It was reported that on one occasion, Milner stepped in front of Roosevelt to take a photograph. Roosevelt was angered at first, but then simply requested a copy of the picture. When Milner returned to the United States, he was married to Margaret Schneider, the daughter of Eberhard Schneider, on November 1, 1916. In 1916 while on his honeymoon, he was hired by the Balboa Amusement Producing Company in Long Beach, California as a cameraman. He worked for Balboa for a year before he went to work for Thomas H. Ince in the William S. Hart unit. Throughout his career, he worked as a second cameraman for 17 films for William S. Hart. He also later worked with the Constance Talmage Company, and at large production companies like Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Universal, and he went to Paramount in 1925. Later Milner became known for the epic look he lent to Cecil B. DeMille film productions. He worked with DeMille for ten years, and helped him direct movies in Technicolor. Milner also worked with other icons in the film industry including Victor Fleming, Raoul Walsh, Preston Sturges, and Ernst Lubitsch. Milner was captured for three days by Russians with his son, Victor Milner Jr. in 1949. The two were on a trip in Berlin after Milner worked on a film project in Italy, when they were arrested by Soviet officials. They had apparently gotten lost and asked a Russian soldier for directions. They were well-treated, however. Milner retired in 1953 after he completed the film Jeopardy. He died in 1972, having worked on over 130 films throughout his career. Awards and accomplishments Milner was nominated for nine Academy Awards during his career, winning one for cinematography in 1934 for the film Cleopatra. Milner received several nominations for in the category of cinematography in the Academy Awards, including The Crusades in 1935, The General Died at Dawn in 1936, and The Buccaneer in the 1938 awards. Milner was also an honorary member of the American Institute of Cinematography. Milner was a founding member of the American Society of Cinematographers and became its president from 1937 to 1939. Milner was featured on the cover of the Who's Who in 1934, and appeared on the cover of American Cinematographer: The Motion Picture Camera Magazine in April 1935.

Biography  Davey Ray Moor was born as David Raymond Moore in Beirut, his father was an accountant for the United Nations. As a teen he had asthma attacks and was confined indoors where he learned to play the piano by playing along to Elton John and David Bowie. He was raised in Canberra and Sydney. In Canberra he had attended Copland College alongside Russell Kilbey and Charles Ratcliffe. In 1983 Moor, on keyboards and vocals, with Kilbey, Phil Maher and Ratcliffe formed a psychedelic rock group, the Crystal Set, in Sydney. Moor also supplied keyboards for the psychedelic band, the Church, on two of their extended plays, Remote Luxury (March 1984) and Persia (August). The Crystal Set issued their debut album, From Now On, in May 1987 ‚Äì which included the track, \\"Flat Earth\\", written by Moor. He left the Crystal Set in April 1988. The album went to the top of the Australian Independent Chart, and was well received by the critics. Moor relocated to the United Kingdom where he began working at The Beatmasters' studio as a media and film composer. He later established a recording studio near Glastonbury where, for the next decade, he composed soundtracks for television, film, advertising and documentaries. In 1998, with partners Robin Brown and Zennor Alexander, Moor contributed the soundtrack to the BAFTA-winning Best Documentary for a Channel 4 \\"Dispatches\\" film. Other prizes included Best Short for an MTV ident at the New York Film Festival in 1993. Clients across this period include Pepsi, Budweiser, Bacardi, Nintendo, Nissan, Remington, the BBC, Channel 4, ITV, MTV, VH-1 and Sky. All the while Moor continued to develop his idea for original songs, eventually writing all the songs that were to become the launchpad for Cousteau. Toward the end of the nineties, Moor recruited Cousteau and the band recorded a collection of his songs. An invitation to play on Later With Jools Holland on the BBC launched the band into the mainstream. In 2000, Chris Blackwell's Palm Pictures released the recordings as a self-titled album. With baritone Liam McKahey singing all but two of the songs (Moor leads the vocals on the others), Cousteau's lounge-set sound was presented with the perfect raft upon which Moor's romantic sound could float. The band received both enthusiastic reviews (Single of the Week, The Times, Album of The Week, The Guardian, 5-stars, Uncut) and sales throughout the United Kingdom and Europe and met with substantial success in the United States. Capturing the allure of its predecessor, a second album Sirena replicated its critical and substantial commercial success yet Moor departed the band prior to their third American tour. Instead he chose to work as a producer on Italian singer Cristina Don√†'s album, which achieved critical acclaim and went to No. 4 on the Italian Charts. In 2004, with the assistance of vocalists Sergio Cocchi, Darion Marshall, Christina Dona and Debbie Sanders, Moor released his first true solo endeavour \\"Telepathy\\" on NuN/Edel in Europe. 4 and 5 star reviews across publications such as Rolling Stone Magazine and All Music followed, and Telepathy was included in Musica's Critics Top 100 in 2004 - one of two albums that Moor wrote and produced - the other being Cristina Don√†'s debut album in English. In 2005 Telepathy was released by Lakeshore Records throughout the US. Critical reaction was again enthusiastic, some describing the album as the best work of his career. Later Moor teamed up with Libertine Carl Barat co- wrote Run With the Boys, Carve My Name, Shadows Fall, Death Fires and This Is The Song on Barat's eponymous solo album, which was released in 2010. He co- wrote one song (Beginning To See) with Barat, and also produced two songs (We Want More and The Gears) on Carl Barat and The Jackals' Let It Reign album. Moor and Barat continued their partnership, composing the soundtrack to the French movie This Is My Body, directed by Paule Mueret which debuted at the Geneva Film Festival in 2015. It was in this era that the songs The Innermost Light and Love Is Not On Trial were written, later performed by the reformed CousteauX. That same year, Moor and Liam McKahey re-united to record their comeback album 'CousteauX'. In September 2017 the album was released in the UK and the US to resounding acclaim. Mojo magazine gave the album 4 stars, describing it as 'feel-the-quality nourish songs of emotional masochism'. All Music said \\"CousteauX is not only one of the year's most promising debuts, but a timeless offering that a decade on will sound as vital and provocative as it does now.\\" Music Republic awarded it 5 stars and claimed it was \\"One of the very best albums in a decade- the album throbs and pulses with passion... It‚Äôs faultless.\\" KCRW in LA featured the opening track Memory Is A Weapon in its Today's Top Tune feature, and Huffington Post singled out Seasons of You for a feature. The album launched with sell out shows in Milan, London, Oxford and Porto. CousteauX remain an international cult band with a following distributed across 47 countries. As of October 2018, he held the position of Course Director MMus Songwriting (Distance Learning) at Bath Spa University.

Some recent quotations have included rerum lacrimae sunt or sunt lacrimae rerum meaning \\"there are tears of (or for) things.\\" Background In this passage, Aeneas gazes at a mural found in a Carthaginian temple dedicated to Juno that depicts battles of the Trojan War and the deaths of his friends and countrymen. Aeneas is moved to tears and says \\"sunt lacrimae rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt\\" (\\"There are tears for [or 'of'] things and mortal things touch the mind.\\") Two interpretations The genitive \\"rerum\\" can be construed as \\"objective\\" or \\"subjective.\\" The scholar David Wharton observes that the \\"semantic and referential indeterminacy is both intentional and poetically productive, lending it an implicational richness most readers find attractive.\\" In English, however, a translator must choose either one or the other, and interpretation has varied. Those who take the genitive as subjective translate the phrase as meaning that things feel sorrow for the sufferings of humanity: the universe feels our pain. Others translate the passage to show that the burden human beings must bear, ever-present frailty and suffering, is what defines the essence of human experience. Yet in the next line, Aeneas says: \\"Release (your) fear; this fame will bring you some deliverance.\\" Those who take the genitive as objective understand the phrase as meaning that there are tears for things (in particular, the things Aeneas has endured) evinced in the mural: i.e., the paintings show Aeneas that he finds himself in a place where he can expect compassion and safety. Context and translations The context of the passage is as follows: Aeneas sees on the temple mural depictions of key figures in the Trojan War ‚Äì the war from which he had been driven to the alien shores of Carthage as a refugee: the sons of Atreus (Agamemnon and Menelaus), Priam, and Achilles, who was savage to both sides in the war. He then cries out: > \\"Sunt hic etiam sua praemia laudi; sunt lacrimae rerum et mentem mortalia > tangunt. Solve metus; feret haec aliquam tibi fama salutem.\\" \\"Here, too, the > praiseworthy has its rewards; there are tears for things and mortal things > touch the mind. Release your fear; this fame will bring you some safety.\\" > Virgil, Aeneid, 1.461 ff. A translation by Robert Fagles renders the quote as: \\"The world is a world of tears, and the burdens of mortality touch the heart.\\"Willard Spiegelman, Imaginative transcripts: selected literary essays, Oxford Univ. Press, p.11 Robert Fitzgerald, meanwhile, translates it as: \\"They weep here / For how the world goes, and our life that passes \\\\ Touches their hearts.\\"Nicolae Babuts, Memory, metaphors, and meaning: reading literary texts, Transaction Publishers, 2009, p.173 In his television series Civilisation, episode 1, Kenneth Clark translated this line as \\"These men know the pathos of life, and mortal things touch their hearts.\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNGzoJFj9g8 The poet Seamus Heaney rendered the first three words, \\"There are tears at the heart of things.\\"Seamus Heaney, Virgil's Poetic Influence, an essay broadcast on BBC Radio 3 as part of the Greek and Latin Voices series, 15 July, 2008 (23:00). Usage The phrase is sometimes taken out of context, on war memorials for example, as a sad sentiment about life's inescapable sorrows. In the poem the phrase appears as Aeneas realises that he need not fear for his safety, because he is among people who have compassion and an understanding of human sorrow. In popular culture David Mitchell uses the phrase as the last sign-off in the letters from Robert Frobisher to his friend Sixsmith in the penultimate section of his novel Cloud Atlas. In the introductory video of his YouTube series 'The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows', John Koenig uses the phrase, and sentiment, to introduce his compendium of invented words that aims to fill holes in the English language‚Äîto give a name to 'emotions we all feel but don't have a word for'.

Biography=Early and personal life Beaulieu was born in Nashua on April 2, 1931, the son of Emile Dorilas Beaulieu, Sr. and Albina Claveau Beaulieu. His parents, who struggled to financially support a large family, sent him to live at St. Joseph's Orphanage twice during his childhood. He left school after sixth grade to work. One of Beaulieu's earliest jobs was at McElwain Shoes, where he met his first wife, the former Pauline Leclerc. The couple had six children during their marriage, which lasted until Pauline Beaulieu's death in 1994. Beaulieu's daughter, Jane Beaulieu, was a Democratic member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives and is frequently mentioned as a possible candidate for mayor of Manchester. Beaulieu later married his second wife, Laurette Fournier; their marriage lasted until his death in December 2016. He owned and operated Beaulieu Floor Coverings, Inc. He served in the New Hampshire National Guard from 1948 until 1968, including during the Korean War and the Berlin Crisis of 1961. Early political career Beaulieu's political career began with his election to the New Hampshire House of Representatives in 1973. In 1974, he was elected the Manchester city Welfare Commissioner, a position he held until he was elected mayor in 1981. Mayor of Manchester In 1981, Beaulieu, a Democrat, challenged and defeated four-term incumbent mayor Dick Stanton, who was seeking re-election in the city's mayoral election. During his first term, Beaulieu partnered with city coordinator John Hoben to spearhead to construct and open the Center of New Hampshire. The Center, which includes a hotel and convention center, has been credited with redeveloping Manchester's downtown business district. Beaulieu also promoted the Amoskeag Millyard Urban Renewal Project and the development of Arms Park and Bass Island. Riverfest, an annual community festival, was revitalized during Beaulieu's tenure. Despite the economic benefits of the Center of New Hampshire, the project may have hurt Beaulieu politically, according to Sylvio Dupuis, another former Manchester mayor. Beaulieu lost his re-election after one term to Republican Bob Shaw in 1983 Manchester mayoral race. Beaulieu later made a political comeback by winning the mayoral election for second term from 1988 to 1989. He and other city officials traveled to Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe, West Germany, and Taichung, Taiwan, to establish sister city relationships during the 1980s. He also approved the creation of Manchester Community Television in 1989. The Manchester city government passed a double-digit property tax increase during his second term, which hurt his popularity. He was defeated for election by Republican Raymond Wieczorek in 1989. Later Civic and political career In 1995, Beaulieu switched his party affiliation from Democratic to Republican, citing his pro-life stances. He announced his candidacy for Governor of New Hampshire in the 1998 gubernatorial election, but lost the Republican primary. Beaulieu's community involvement over the years has been extensive. He was the founder and past president of Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Manchester. Beaulieu has served on the board of directors of several organizations, including the State Employment Training Council and the Child Health Services. He remained active in the city's Republican Party and worked on Mayor Frank Guinta's 2005 election campaign. On Thursday, May 31, 2007, Beaulieu was named honorary co-chairman of Guinta's re-election campaign, despite the fact that his daughter, Jane Beaulieu, a Democrat and New Hampshire state representative, was considering a potential campaign for mayor against Guinta. Later life Beaulieu suffered a stroke in 2016. He died at Catholic Medical Center in Manchester, New Hampshire, on December 30, 2016, at the age of 85. He was survived by his second wife of 25 years, Laurette Beaulieu; his five children, three step-children, 13 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.

The screenplay, written by producer Robert Kent, is an adaptation of Guy de Maupassant's two short stories \\"Le Horla\\" (\\"The Horla\\"), written in 1887, and \\"Un fou\\" (\\"The Diary of a Madman\\"), written in 1885. Kent's rendition is notably divergent from the source material, especially in relation to the religious and moral themes of the film, which contradict not only those of the short story, but de Maupassant's as well. The distinctive manner in which the Horla in the story lives on water and milk is dispensed with in the movie. Plot Following the funeral of Simon Cordier (Vincent Price), a French magistrate and amateur sculptor, his secret diary is read out by Simon's pastor friend to a group of people gathered around the table, Simon's servants, and a police captain. The diary reveals that Simon has come into contact with a malevolent entity. The invisible yet corporeal being, called a horla, is capable of limited psychokinesis and complete mind control. It is implied that Cordier's particular horla is one of a whole race of evil beings which devote themselves to driving humans insane. Cordier first interacts with the horla when he meets a prisoner whom the entity drove to murder four people. The horla possesses the inmate and attempts to kill Cordier, who in self-defense accidentally kills the man. The magistrate inherits the prisoner's troubles as the horla turns its hauntings toward him. As the horla begins to destroy Cordier's life, he fears he is going mad and seeks help from an alienist, who suggests that he take up a hobby. Cordier chooses to pick up his old interest in sculpture, meeting a model along the way. The model, Odette Malotte, is already married, but claims to love Cordier and he pledges his love to her in turn. The horla insists the model is not the charming jewel that Cordier sees, but instead a conniving gold-digger, and compels Cordier to treat her as such. This sets up a conflict in Cordier, that he might not be the astute judge of character that his title indicates. In an episode of insanity, Cordier murders Odette with a knife. Her decapitated body is found in the river, but her husband (not Cordier) is blamed for the crime. As his and others' lives are put in jeopardy, he becomes convinced of the horla's existence and decides drastic measures are needed to end its evil. He lures the horla into his house at night. When his presence is felt, Simon hurls an oil lamp towards the curtains, setting the house ablaze. Simon succeeds in destroying the horla, but not without sacrificing himself as the house burns in flames. The film concludes with the people seated around the table after reading Simon's diary. Some believe Simon was mad and that the horla does not exist, others are unsure and believe that the horla might have existed. The priest's opinion is that wherever evil exists, the horla exists.

It is located in Adelaide's District 5 (North West) school district, in close proximity to Golden Grove High School, Gleeson College and Pedare Christian College. Structure The Heights School consists of three sub-schools, divided by year level. The sub- schools are: * Junior School ‚Äì Preschool (CPC) ‚Äì Year 5 * Middle School ‚Äì Year 6 ‚Äì Year 9 * Senior School ‚Äì Year 10 ‚Äì Year 12+ students Special programs=Ignite program The Heights School is an Ignite school. This program allows gifted students to work at an extended level. The program has three levels: the Ignite Program, the Co-Ignite Program and the Pre-Ignite Program. The Ignite class studies years 8, 9 and 10 in two years. This is done by studying year 8 and 9 in one year and then year 10 in one year but at an extended level. Students then go on to study years 11 and 12 at a normal level. As Ignite students leave school a year earlier, they can, if they wish, complete year 13 to fill in that year. Beginning in 2018 an Ignite accelerated class will be established in Year 9, allowing accelerated students to complete Year 9 at a normal pace. Students in Year 8 may optionally 'skip' to Year 10. The Co-Ignite class studies years 8, 9 and 10 in the full three years but at an extended level. They then complete years 11 and 12 as normal. For technology lessons, the two classes come together to study with each other. The Heights School also offers a Pre-Ignite Program. This is not an official part of the Ignite Program. This was designed by The Height's Brennan Finch to allow students whom they thought would be able to complete the Ignite Program, to do years 6 and 7 at an extended level. Glenunga International High School (starting 1998) and Aberfoyle Park High School (1999) are also Ignite schools. Cricket program The Heights School has developed a specialised cricketing program in association with the Tea Tree Gully District Cricket Club and the South Australian Cricket Association (SACA). The program is run by state under 14s coach and Northern Jets A Grade player Andrew Costello and is offered a special subject for years 8‚Äì11. Australian HPV Super Series (Pedal Prix) The school has a major involvement in the Australian International HPV Super Series, with the program currently being run by Roger Button. With annual involvement from 2004 in all three races per year, with four HPVs as of 2011. The four bikes are \\"Quasar\\", which is ridden by students from the junior school; \\"Pulsar\\", the middle school bike; \\"Odyssey\\", the senior school bike; and an Old Scholars team and bike, which races under the name of \\"THOR\\". The school has also hosted students from Hwa Chong Institution who raced with the Heights team in Round 1 of 2008. All bikes now support a green image and promote environmentally friendly activities, hence the program's official name, \\"The Heights School Green Technology Racing\\". Wakakirri The Heights School has long been involved in Wakakirri. The program is currently run by Penny Phillips. Wakakirri involves students acting or dancing to music. Voice is not used at all. Although Heights School mainly focuses on the story-dance category, it does also enter in the story-film category and story writing. In 2010, five students from Heights had their stories published in the Wakakirri Story Book. Its past performances include Dark Deeds in Duckville, Spring Around the World, Tapping into Your Talent and Beat the Crave and Save. In 2011, the Heights School performed Don't Judge a Moth by Its Colour, which went on to win the South Australian finals.http://www.wakakirri.com/wakakirri-primary/primary-results-and- prizes/primary-results-story-dance/story-dance-live-results-adelaide South Australian Public (Primary) Schools Music Society Festival of Music The Heights School (years 6 and 7) participate in the South Australian Public (Primary) Schools Music Society Festival of Music. This extra-curricular activity run by Algis Laurinaitis involves a choir, and some students are able to audition for instrumental roles and solo parts. The choir sings a set of songs decided on by the South Australian Public (Primary) Schools Music Society. Every year there is a 'theme' (e.g. fairy tales) that the main songs are about. There is also a song included about bullying and indigenous Australians. Autism Intervention Program The Autism Intervention Program is a DECD initiative which uses the Ziggurat model of intervention to provide a holistic education, catering to the needs of individual learners on the autism spectrum. Students receive targeted intervention, designed to assist in eradicating the defined, or potential barriers to their inclusion. Emphasis is placed on addressing the \\"triad of impairments\\" for learners with ASD. Skills and strategies will be explicitly taught to address students': ‚Äì Pragmatic (social) development ‚Äì Language ‚Äì Behavioural responses Learners are taught methods to think flexibly and self regulate their behaviour whilst meeting sensory needs in socially acceptable ways. Individually tailored programs also target students' academic needs. Other The school participates in foreign exchanges with Hwa Chong Institution in Singapore, Jit Sin High School in Penang, Malaysia, as well as schools in Japan and Korea. Observatory The Heights Observatory The Heights School is the home of the Heights Astronomical Observatory, which consists of two observatory buildings. The Emanuel Papaelia Observatory consists of a 5-metre dome containing a 14-inch (355mm) Meade LX200 ACF Schmidt Cassegrain reflecting telescope acquired in 2011. It can be computer controlled, and is used visually for public viewing nights. The School's student STAR Group uses the telescope both visually and for astrophotography. The ground level of the observatory building includes an official seismic recording station operated by the Department of Primary Industries and Resources. The Ingham Family Rooms is a roll-off roof building that doubles as a classroom for STAR Group students studying astronomy. It contains a sophisticated, high end, 12.5\\" Ritchey‚ÄìChr√©tien design reflector from Optical Guidance Systems acquired in 2012, which features a carbon fibre tube, zero expansion ceramic mirror and a motorised secondary mirror for computer-aided focussing. This telescope is mounted on a Losmandy HGM 200 mount, and uses the Losmandy Gemini Control system for automated tracking. The observatory also holds a number of portable, non-tracking telescopes, in particular a 16-inch Meade Lightbridge Dobsonian. The Astronomical Society of South Australia holds public viewing nights at the Heights Observatory once a month.http://www.assa.org.au/facilities/theheights/ Students from the school are actively involved with the observatory, with the STAR (Students Thinking with Astronomical Reasoning) Group meeting weekly at the observatory to observe and learn about astronomy and astrophysics. The Heights Observatory is located at Lat 34.812488 S, Lon 138.682504 W.

American horror writer H. P. Lovecraft, in his survey \\"Supernatural Horror in Literature\\" (1927), provides his own interpretation of the story: The story has been cited as an inspiration for Lovecraft's own \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\", which also features an extraterrestrial being who influences minds and who is destined to conquer humanity.S. T. Joshi and David E. Schultz, \\"Call of Cthulhu, The,\\" An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia, p. 28. The word horla itself is not French, and is a neologism. Charlotte Mandell, who has translated \\"The Horla\\" for publisher Melville House, suggests in an afterword that the word \\"horla\\" is a portmanteau of the French words hors (\\"outside\\"), and l√† (\\"there\\") and that \\"le horla\\" sounds like \\"the Outsider, the outer, the one Out There,\\" and can be transliterally interpreted as \\"the 'what's out there'\\". Synopsis In the form of a journal, the narrator, an upper-class, unmarried, bourgeois man, conveys his troubled thoughts and feelings of anguish. This anguish occurs for four days after he sees a \\"superb three-mast\\" Brazilian ship and impulsively waves to it, unconsciously inviting the supernatural being aboard the boat to haunt his home. 200px All around him, he senses the presence of a being that he calls the \\"Horla\\". The torment that the Horla causes is first manifested physically: The narrator complains that he suffers from \\"an atrocious fever\\", and that he has trouble sleeping. He wakes up from nightmares with the chilling feeling that someone is watching him and \\"kneeling on [his] chest.\\" Throughout the short story, the main character's sanity, or rather, his feelings of alienation, are put into question as the Horla progressively dominates his thoughts. Initially, the narrator himself questions his sanity, exclaiming \\"Am I going mad?\\" after having found his glass of water empty, despite not having drunk from it. He later decides that he is not, in fact, going mad, since he is fully \\"conscious\\" of his \\"state\\" and that he could indeed \\"analyze it with the most complete lucidity.\\" The presence of the Horla becomes more and more intolerable to the protagonist, as it is \\"watching‚Ä¶looking at‚Ä¶[and] dominating\\" him. After reading about a large number of Brazilians who fled their homes, bemoaning the fact that \\"they are pursued, possessed, governed like human cattle by‚Ä¶a species of vampire, which feeds on their life while they are asleep‚Ä¶[and] drinks water,\\" the narrator soon realizes the Horla was aboard the Brazilian three-mast boat that he had previously greeted. He feels so \\"lost\\" and \\"possessed\\" to the point that he is ready to kill either the Horla, or himself. Influences=Literature *\\"The Horla\\" is used as an extension of the plot in the short story \\"The Theater Upstairs\\" by Manly Wade Wellman. In Wellman's novel Sherlock Holmes' War of the Worlds (1975), Sherlock Holmes suggests to Professor Challenger that the events of \\"The Horla\\" might actually be true. * The Bartimaeus Trilogy (2003‚Äì2010) features horlas as powerful spirits, who appear as shadowy apparitions that cause madness in humans similar to the titular Horla of the short story. * \\"The Horla\\" is the inspiration for Robert Sheckley's short story \\"The New Horla\\" (2000) in his collection Uncanny Tales. * Kingsley Amis's first novel Lucky Jim (1954, chapter 6) describes Jim Dixon, a guest lecturer at a university, waking in a guestroom owned by the senior colleague whose good will he is depending on to continue in his job the next academic year, discovering he has fallen asleep drunk, and burned holes through blankets and sheets and on a bedside table. \\"Had he done this all to himself? Or had a wayfarer, a burglar, camped out in his room? Or was he the victim of some Horla fond of tobacco?\\" Popular culture * The movie Diary of a Madman (1963) is loosely based on \\"The Horla\\". * The Star Trek episode \\"Wolf in the Fold\\" (1967) features a Horla-like entity. * Jean-Daniel Pollet directed a film adaptation called \\"Le Horla\\" in 1966. * The CBS Radio Mystery Theater adapted the story for episode 044, originally aired on February 22, 1974. * The Hall of Fantasy radio show aired an episode on September 5, 1952, called \\"The Shadow People\\", which makes reference to the Horla. * \\"The Horla\\" (1947) is episode 8 of Peter Lorre's radio serial Mystery in the Air. * \\"The Horla\\" was adapted for the syndicated radio program The Weird Circle. *Holes are mentioned or featured in several stories from the Tales of the Shadowmen series, including one story where a Horla is encountered by Solomon Kane. * \\"The Horla\\" is also an influence on Mario Bava's story \\"Telephone\\", featured in his film Black Sabbath. * \\"The Horla\\" is the title of a song from the British heavy metal band Angel Witch, appearing on their 2012 album As Above, So Below. * The concept album D'Apr√®s Le Horla De Maupassant of Canadian progressive rock band The Box is based on \\"The Horla\\". * The third track of French hip-hop artist Nekfeu's debut album, Feu, is entitled \\"Le Horla\\".

Initially the German Solomon Islands Protectorate included in the south-east Choiseul, Santa Isabel and the Shortlands with highly northern, vast, mainly water Ontong Java Atoll that in 1900 were conferred to the British Solomon Islands Protectorate. Greatest of the region, Bougainville, continued under German administration until World War I when it fell to Australia, and after the war, it formally passed to Australian jurisdiction under a League of Nations mandate. The Solomons archipelago. Today, what were the North Solomon Islands are split between the Autonomous Region of Bougainville (in Papua New Guinea) and the sovereign nation of Solomon Islands. The latter gained independence in 1976 and succeeded the British Solomon Islands Protectorate known for decades before 1975 as the British Solomon Islands.  History  On 17 February 1568, the Spanish explorer Alvaro de Menda√±a y Neyra became the first European to sight the island, naming them Islas de Salomon. In April 1885 a German protectorate (Schutzgebiet) was declared over the northern Solomon Islands: Bougainville, Buka, Choiseul, Santa Isabel and Ontong Java Atoll. In 1893 the British declared a protectorate over the southern Solomon Islands of New Georgia, Guadalcanal, Malaita and San Cristobal, and this protectorate became known as the British Solomon Islands Protectorate. In 1898 Britain annexed the Santa Cruz and the Rennell and Bellona Islands. In the year 1900, under the terms of Treaty of Berlin (14 November 1899), Germany transferred Choiseul, Santa Isabel, the Shortlands and Ontong Java Atoll Islands to the British Solomon Islands Protectorate, but retained Bougainville and its surrounding islands. Germany granted this claim in exchange for the British giving up all claims to Samoa.  Missions  A United Church village choir in Siwai, Bougainville, 1978 The Roman Catholic Apostolic Prefecture of the Northern Solomon Islands was established on 23 May 1898, by separation from the Apostolic Vicariate of New Pomerania, including the Islands of Ysabel, Choiseul, Bougainville and all the islets under German protectorate; until 1904, it was named Apostolic Prefecture of German Solomon Islands. In 1897 the islands were put under the jurisdiction of Mgr Broyer, Apostolic Vicar of Samoa, and in 1898 formed into a new prefecture under Mgr Joseph Forestier, who resided at Kieta, on Bougainville Island. Fever was so prevalent at the mission that most of the fathers who went to the islands in 1898 were carried off by disease. In 1911 the mission contained: 3 churches; 3 stations; 10 Marist Fathers; 5 lay brothers; 7 sisters of the Third Order of Mary; 2 Samoan catechists; 5 Catholic schools, with 140 pupils; 2 orphanages; and a few hundred Catholics. The Marist missionaries belonged to the Province of Oceania, the superior of which resided at Sydney, New South Wales. In 1930, it was promoted to Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Solomon Islands, from which the present Roman Catholic Diocese of Bougainville stems.

Plot summary  The film is centered on the America's Cup series of yachting races and uses them as a backdrop for both an action/adventure and a romantic storyline. Cup events depicted in the film A host of events that occurred in the 1987 America's Cup held off Fremantle Australia were translated into film and presented as events occurring to the characters in the movie, including the following: * Will Parker striking the buoy while rounding the final mark was taken from Chris Dickson's final race against Stars & Stripes 87 in the Louis Vuitton Cup Finals. Kiwi Magic was just six seconds back of Dennis Conner's boat when Dickson made his only major mistake of the summer, striking the buoy while rounding the final mark. He was obliged to re-round, ending all hope of catching Stars & Stripes 87. * Jack Neville spearing the \\"Whomper\\" was taken from the Defender Semifinals, when Australia IV introduced a new sail they called the 'gennaker', an enormous asymmetrical hybrid that pulled Australia IV even with the leading Kookaburra II. As the Bond team came up, Peter Gilmour luffed hard, spearing Australia IV's gennaker and splitting it in two. * The broken mast of the Platypus occurred to Challenge France in the middle of the third and final challenger rounds robins. Challenge France was unable to continue in the regatta. * The boat collision occurred in the Defender series, when Australia IV struck Peter Gilmour's Kookaburra II. * The protests and media briefings occurred multiple times throughout the regatta, and at times were quite contentious. *Stellan Skarsg√•rd's character is based on Burt Rutan, who constructed a wing sail for Dennis Conner‚Äôs 1988 catamaran ‚ÄúStars & Stripes‚Äù.  Cast  *Matthew Modine as Will Parker *Jennifer Grey as Kate Bass *Cliff Robertson as Morgan Weld *Jack Thompson as Jack Neville *Stellan Skarsg√•rd as Joe Heiser *Rebecca Miller as Abigail Weld *Ned Vaughn as Charley Moore  Production  The film was inspired by the New York Yacht Club's loss of the 1983 America's Cup through the events of the 1987 America's Cup. Several of the 12-metre class yachts that participated in Cup races were used in the movie. \\"Wind\\" contains some of the best, most realistic, on deck big- boat sailing sequences ever portrayed. America's Cup skipper Peter Gilmour, whose aggressive sailing during the 1987 defender selection series earned himself a place on the defender boat for the America's Cup, was \\"Sailing Master\\" for the film. He was on board for all of the sailing sequences, controlled the boat while they were flying the \\"Whomper\\", and can be seen in many of the boat scenes, surreptitiously laying a hand on the opposite wheel. Lisa Blackaller, daughter of America's Cup skipper Tom Blackaller, acted as sailing double for Jennifer Grey for the small boat races in the International 14 class at Newport. American Eagle (US 21), the red 12 Meter ocean endurance champion sailed to fame by Ted Turner in the mid-seventies, was used as the trial horse sailed by Will Parker in preparation for the America's Cup. The boat had been a finalist in the 1964 Defender selection series but lost the selection to Constellation. The 12-meter yachts depicting the America's Cup races were the more modern boats from the America II Syndicate, America II (US 42) and America II (US 46). The boat repainted as Boomerang and later as Platypus was depicted by US 42, and Radiance and then later Geronimo were depicted by US 46. US 46 had been sailed by John Kolius in the 1987 Louis Vuitton Challenger Selection Cup races. Many of the film's port scenes were filmed on location in and around Newport, Rhode Island, with the sailing scenes of the International 14's competition and the America's Cup races filmed off Perth in Western Australia. Parts of the film were also shot in Green River, Wendover, and the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. Shooting took twelve weeks, beginning on 25 February 1991.\\"Wind\\", Cinema Papers, January 1992 p18 New Zealand's long time America's Cup commentator Peter Montgomery also lent his voice to the climactic final races in the film.

It connects the Fourier transforms of coadjoint orbits, which lie in the dual space of the Lie algebra of G, to the infinitesimal characters of the irreducible representations. The method got its name after the Russian mathematician Alexandre Kirillov. At its simplest, it states that a character of a Lie group may be given by the Fourier transform of the Dirac delta function supported on the coadjoint orbits, weighted by the square-root of the Jacobian of the exponential map, denoted by j. It does not apply to all Lie groups, but works for a number of classes of connected Lie groups, including nilpotent, some semisimple groups, and compact groups. The Kirillov orbit method has led to a number of important developments in Lie theory, including the Duflo isomorphism and the wrapping map.  Character formula for compact Lie groups  Let \\\\lambda \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{t}^* be the highest weight of an irreducible representation \\\\pi , where \\\\mathfrak{t}^* is the dual of the Lie algebra of the maximal torus, and let \\\\rho be half the sum of the positive roots. We denote by \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\lambda + \\\\rho} the coadjoint orbit through \\\\lambda + \\\\rho \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{t}^* and by \\\\mu_{\\\\lambda + \\\\rho} the G-invariant measure on \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\lambda + \\\\rho} with total mass \\\\dim \\\\pi = d_\\\\lambda, known as the Liouville measure. If \\\\chi_\\\\lambda is the character of the representation, the Kirillov's character formula for compact Lie groups is given by : j^{1/2}(X) \\\\chi_\\\\lambda (\\\\exp X) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\lambda + \\\\rho}} e^{i\\\\beta (X)}d\\\\mu_{\\\\lambda + \\\\rho} (\\\\beta), \\\\; \\\\forall \\\\; X \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{g} , where j(X) is the Jacobian of the exponential map.  Example: SU(2)  For the case of SU(2), the highest weights are the positive half integers, and \\\\rho = 1/2 . The coadjoint orbits are the two-dimensional spheres of radius \\\\lambda + 1/2 , centered at the origin in 3-dimensional space. By the theory of Bessel functions, it may be shown that : \\\\int_{\\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\lambda + 1/2}} e^{i\\\\beta (X)}d\\\\mu_{\\\\lambda + 1/2} (\\\\beta) = \\\\frac{\\\\sin((2\\\\lambda + 1)X)}{X/2}, \\\\; \\\\forall \\\\; X \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{g}, and : j(X) = \\\\frac{\\\\sin X/2}{X/2} thus yielding the characters of SU(2): : \\\\chi_\\\\lambda (\\\\exp X) = \\\\frac{\\\\sin((2\\\\lambda + 1)X)}{\\\\sin X/2}  References  *Kirillov, A.

This case is particularly unusual as the Act had previously held to be constitutional under the Criminal law power in the decision of Industrial Acceptance Corp. v. The Queen [1953] 2 S.C.R. 273. Hauser, the respondent, was charged by indictment on two counts under the Narcotic Control Act: possession of cannabis resin for the purpose of trafficking, and possession of cannabis (marijuana) for the same purpose, contrary to s. 4(2). The indictment was signed and preferred by an agent of the Attorney General of Canada. The respondent then moved for prohibition, challenging the constitutional validity of s. 2 para. (b) of the Criminal Code which defines the term \\"Attorney General\\" in various situations. The respondent's argument was that because para. (b) gives the Attorney General of Canada the power to (1) prefer indictments for an offence under the Narcotic Control Act, and (2)have the conduct of proceedings under said act instituted at the instance of the Government of Canada, it steps upon the rights granted to the Provinces under s. 92(14) of the British North America Act 1867 (AKA Constitution Act 1867)for \\"The Administration of Justice in the Province, including the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organization of Provincial Courts, both of Civil and of Criminal Jurisdiction, and including Procedure in Civil Matters in those Courts.\\" The Attorney General of Canada correctly asserted that the Canadian Government has authority under s. 91(27) of the Constitution Act 1867 Act to legislate in regards to \\"the Criminal Law, except the Constitution of Courts of Criminal Jurisdiction, but including the Procedure in Criminal Matters.\\" He argued that the Narcotic Control Act is not criminal law because it is an act separate from the Criminal Code, and therefore the jurisdiction belongs with him and not with the Provincial Attorneys General. Appeal was granted by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta. Laskin, C.J. posed the constitutional questions to the court as follows: Is it within the competence of the Parliament of Canada to enact legislation as in Section 2 of the Criminal Code to authorize the Attorney General of Canada or his Agent: # to prefer indictments for an offence under the Narcotic Control Act, # to have the conduct of proceedings instituted at the instance of the Government of Canada in respect of a violation or conspiracy to violate any Act of the Parliament of Canada or regulations made thereunder other than the Criminal Code? Pigeon J., writing for the majority, held that the matter of law had sufficient \\"newness\\" to fall under the p.o.g.g. power, stating that: :...the most important consideration for classifying the Narcotic Control Act as legislation enacted under the general residual federal power, is that this is essentially legislation adopted to deal with a genuinely new problem which did not exist at the time of Confederation and clearly cannot be put in the class of \\"Matters of a merely local or private nature\\". Dickson J. wrote the dissenting opinion, stating that he believed the Narcotics Control Act to be, in pith and substance, criminal law and therefore the responsibility of the Provinces, citing many cases of common law and established precedents.

The organization is headquartered in New York City, with local/regional offices in Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago and Los Angeles, and volunteer- led affiliated groups in a number of other U.S. communities. It was founded in 1934 in response to the rise of Nazism in Europe. Today, it works to maintain and strengthen the historically strong relationship between the American Jewish community and the trade union movement, and to promote what they see as the shared social justice agenda of both communities. The JLC was also active in Canada from 1936 until the 1970s. History The Jewish Labor Committee was formed in February 1934, in response to the rise of Nazism in Germany, by Yiddish-speaking immigrant trade union leaders, including leaders of established groups such as the Workmen's Circle/Arbeter Ring, the Jewish Labor Bund, and the United Hebrew Trades. Representatives assembled at a conference on New York's Lower East Side, electing its first president, Baruch Charney Vladeck, and charging it with the following tasks: * support of Jewish labor institutions in European countries; * assistance to the anti-Hitler underground movement; * aid to the victims of Nazism; * cooperation with American organized labor in fighting anti-democratic forces; and * combating anti-semitism and other effects of Fascism and Nazism upon American life. At the urging of B.C. Vladeck and Jewish union leaders, the American Federation of Labor (AFL) came out in favor of a boycott of Nazi goods at its 1933 convention. At the 1934 convention of the AFL, Vladeck argued that the Nazi persecution of Jews was part of a general assault on labor rights and political liberty. The AFL agreed and in response it created the \\"Labor Chest\\" to aid victims of fascism; in the following years, the Chest funded a host of JLC-inspired educational and aid projects. During the first five years of its existence, the Jewish Labor Committee concentrated mainly on supporting anti- Nazi labor forces in Europe and sending relief to Jewish labor institutions there, especially those maintained by the Jewish Labor and the \\"left\\" Labor Zionist movement (the \\"right\\" Labor Zionists organized their own relief and rehabilitation committee), and encouraging and strengthening U.S. and Canadian opposition to the Nazis, in the labor and democratic left, as well as in the community-at-large. At the same time it organized mass anti-Nazi demonstrations; in 1936, with the American Jewish Congress, through the Joint Boycott Council, it conducted a boycott on German goods and services. After the outbreak of World War II, the emphasis focused on efforts to save Jewish cultural and political figures, as well as Jewish and non-Jewish labor and socialist leaders facing certain death at the hands of the Nazis. With powerful help from the American Federation of Labor, the Committee succeeded in bringing over a thousand of such individuals to the United States, or to temporary shelter elsewhere. The JLC's main focus was unified action, but also took independent action for their anti-Nazi campaign. When the American Olympics Committee declined to boycott the Berlin Olympics of 1936, the JLC held a World Labor Athletic Carnival (also known as the Counter-Olympics) at Randall's Island in New York City. Dozens of teams representing New York union locals competed, and featured amateur athletes from across the country. NY Governor Herbert Lehman presented the awards. The Carnival received extensive nationwide press coverage, and the JLC repeated the event in the summer of 1937. After the war, the JLC organized a Child Adoption Program. The program was not meant to provide adoption in the usual sense, but rather to provide a mechanism by which Americans could contribute to the care of children living in Europe or Israel. At a cost of $300 per year, a union shop or local, fraternal society, Workmen's Circle branch, women's club, or any other group or individual could \\"adopt\\" a child. Thousands of children were supported through this program into the 1950s. Beginning in the late 1930s, the Committee became increasingly concerned with Jewish defense work and community relations in the United States. It was one of the four founders of the short- lived General Jewish Council and helped organize the National Community Relations Advisory Council (renamed the Jewish Council for Public Affairs (JCPA) in the 1990s), of which it is still an active member. Activities Unlike other community relations agencies, the JLC has its sphere of action clearly delineated: it strives to represent Jewish communal interests in the labor movement, and labor interests in the organized Jewish community. Working with the American Federation of Labor‚ÄîCongress of Industrial Organizations since the AFL-CIO's formation in 1956, and the Change to Win federation since the CtW's formation in 2005, and their affiliated trade unions, the JLC works with and has the support of a wide range of unions and their associated organizations, locally, nationally and internationally. With diverse organizations as affiliates representing a variety of ideological groups, the Committee has been guided in its work by pragmatic policies rather than by a specific philosophy. While Bundist influence was significant in the organization, particularly in the early period, JLC been critically supportive of the State of Israel since 1948. Both Ameinu (formerly known as the Labor Zionist Alliance and Partners for Progressive Israel (formerly known as Meretz USA) are affiliates of the JLC, as is the Workmen's Circle/Arbeter Ring. The JLC can broadly speaking be considered part of what is sometimes called the Jewish left in America. In 2000, the JLC began an annual tradition of holding local \\"Labor Seders\\" in communities throughout the U.S. These \\"Labor Seders\\" are often held in conjunction with local Central Labor Councils and local Jewish Community Relations Councils, and serve as a way for local Jewish and labor leaders to come together and share an engaging experience, and relate the traditional Passover exodus from Egypt story to more recent examples of the struggle for basic worker's rights. Emulating these \\"Labor Seders,\\" a similar \\"Union Seder\\" was organized in Sydney, Australia in 2006. In addition to the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, the JLC is a founding member of a number of other U.S. and international Jewish communal agencies, including the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture, the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, and the National Conference on Soviet Jewry. The New England Region of the JLC is a partner organization of the Boston-based JOIN for Justice (formerly known as the Jewish Organizing Initiative), which was formed in 1994 as a mechanism for young adults to enter the field of community organizing through an explicitly Jewish channel. Through it, the JLC's field office in Boston secured a number of regional directors and interns. The JLC's funding comes from independent campaigns, contributions from trade unions, allocations from Jewish community federations, grants from foundations, individual members and organizational affiliates. (Originally a body of organizations and unions, the Committee has also had individual members since the mid-1960s.) Civil rights The JLC founded an Anti-Discrimination Division immediately after World War II which agitated and lobbied in favor of Fair Employment Practices legislation, equal opportunities in education and integrated housing.(page 254) In Canada, in the 1940s and 1950s, the Jewish Labour Committee played a leading role in opposing racial discrimination legislation and supporting human rights. Executive Director Kalmen Kaplansky believed that it was necessary to extend the JLC's mandate beyond fighting anti-Semitism to combat discrimination against all minorities and involve non- Jews, and the broader labor movement, in the JLC's civil rights work.Kalmen Kaplansky Scholarship in Economic and Social Rights, Douglas-Coldwell FoundationKalmen Kaplansky , Canada's Rights Movement: A History, accessed February 2, 2008 Under his leadership, the JLC spearheaded the formation of Joint Labour Committees to Combat Racial Discrimination in Toronto, Windsor, Montreal, Vancouver and Winnipeg, which advocated the adoption of human rights codes by provincial governments and which launched challenges against segregation and discriminatory employment and business practices. The JLC also publicly recognized labor leaders and pro-labor politicians who advanced the cause of Civil Rights with testimonial dinners held in their honor. Recipients include AFL President William Green (1951), Illinois AFL-CIO President Reuben Soderstrom (1953), Minnesota Senator (and future Vice President Hubert Humphrey (1954), and AFL-CIO President George Meany (1967). The JLC also formed approximately two dozen local committees in the United States to combat racial intolerance. These committees were the genesis of the American Federation of Labor's Civil Rights Department as well as the civil rights departments of several unions in the 1940s and 1950s. The JLC distributed literature and educational material combatting racism and played a role in state and national campaigns for civil rights legislation. The JLC played a role in the Leadership Conference for Civil Rights and participated in and helped organize civil rights marches and protests in the 1950s and 1960s co- ordinating many local campaigns. The JLC helped found the United Farm Workers, campaigned for the passage of the Fair Employment Practices Act in California and provided staffing and support for the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom led by Martin Luther King Jr.70 Years Strong: The Jewish Labor Committee Story, Jewish Labor Committee, 2004 Allegations of defending discriminatory practices of unions NAACP labor director Herbert Hill alleged that, during the 1940s through the 1960s, the JLC had defended anti-black and anti-Hispanic discriminatory practices of unions in the garment industry and building industry.Hill, Herbert, \\"Black-Jewish Conflict in the Labor Context\\", in African Americans and Jews in the twentieth century: studies in convergence and conflict, Franklin, Vincent P.

It is an alkene and it contains a reactive four-membered ring. It is found in the oils of many species of many coniferous trees, notably the pine. It is also found in the essential oil of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) and Satureja myrtifolia (also known as Zoufa in some regions). Both enantiomers are known in nature; (1S,5S)- or (‚àí)-Œ±-pinene is more common in European pines, whereas the (1R,5R)- or (+)-Œ±-isomer is more common in North America. The racemic mixture is present in some oils such as eucalyptus oil and orange peel oil.  Reactivity  :Some general reactions of Œ±-pinene The four- membered ring in Œ±-pinene 1 makes it a reactive hydrocarbon, prone to skeletal rearrangements such as the Wagner‚ÄìMeerwein rearrangement. For example, attempts to perform hydration or hydrogen halide addition with the alkene functionality typically lead to rearranged products. With concentrated sulfuric acid and ethanol the major products are terpineol 2 and its ethyl ether 3, while glacial acetic acid gives the corresponding acetate ester 4. With dilute acids, terpin hydrate 5 becomes the major product. With one molar equivalent of anhydrous HCl, the simple addition product 6a can be formed at low temperature in the presence of diethyl ether, but it is very unstable. At normal temperatures, or if no ether is present, the major product is bornyl chloride 6b, along with a small amount of fenchyl chloride 6c. For many years 6b (also called \\"artificial camphor\\") was referred to as \\"pinene hydrochloride\\", until it was confirmed as identical with bornyl chloride made from camphene. If more HCl is used, achiral 7 (dipentene hydrochloride) is the major product along with some 6b. Nitrosyl chloride followed by base leads to the oxime 8 which can be reduced to \\"pinylamine\\" 9. Both 8 and 9 are stable compounds containing an intact four-membered ring, and these compounds helped greatly in identifying this important component of the pinene skeleton. A variety of reagents such as iodine or PCl3 cause aromatisation, leading to p-cymene 10. Under aerobic oxidation conditions, the main oxidation products are pinene oxide, verbenyl hydroperoxide, verbenol and verbenone.  Atmospheric role  Monoterpenes, of which Œ±-pinene is one of the principal species, are emitted in substantial amounts by vegetation, and these emissions are affected by temperature and light intensity. In the atmosphere Œ±-pinene undergoes reactions with ozone, the hydroxyl radical or the NO3 radical,IUPAC Subcommittee on Gas Kinetic Data Evaluation leading to low-volatility species which partly condense on existing aerosols, thereby generating secondary organic aerosols. This has been shown in numerous laboratory experiments for the mono- and sesquiterpenes. Products of Œ±-pinene which have been identified explicitly are pinonaldehyde, norpinonaldehyde, pinic acid, pinonic acid and pinalic acid. Properties and usage Œ±-Pinene is highly bioavailable with 60% human pulmonary uptake with rapid metabolism or redistribution. Œ±-Pinene is an anti-inflammatory via PGE1, and seems to be an antimicrobial. It exhibits activity as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, aiding memory. Like borneol, verbenol and pinocarveol (‚àí)-Œ±-pinene is a positive modulator of GABAA receptors. It acts at the benzodiazepine binding site. Œ±-Pinene forms the biosynthetic base for CB2 ligands, such as HU-308. Œ±-Pinene is one of the many terpenes and terpenoids found in cannabis plants. These compounds are also present in significant levels in the finished, dried cannabis flower preparation commonly known as marijuana. It is widely theorized by scientists and cannabis experts alike that these terpenes and terpenoids contribute significantly to the unique \\"character\\" or \\"personality\\" of each marijuana strain's unique effects. Œ±-Pinene in particular is thought to reduce the memory deficits commonly reported as a side-effect of THC consumption. It likely demonstrates this activity due to its action as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, a class of compounds which are known to aid memory and increase alertness. Œ±-Pinene also contributes significantly to many of the varied, distinct, and unique odor profiles of the multitude of marijuana strains, varieties and cultivars.

Early life  McLean was born and raised in the Northern Territory and played both rugby league and Australian football at junior levels. His father, from Queensland pushed for Michael at fifteen years of age to pursue a career in rugby league, however, he decided to continue playing Australian football. McLean played his first senior league with the Nightcliff rugby league club but also played Australian football for the Nightcliff Football Club in the Northern Territory Football League where he was eventually scouted by the Footscray Football Club to play professionally. VFL/AFL career= Footscray career  McLean moved to Victoria and debuted for Footscray in 1983. He became known as a skilful winger who went on to play 95 games and boot 23 goals with the Bulldogs before he suffered an ankle and calf injuries that hampered his career. In response to his injuries, McLean focused on building his lean body to become one of the strongest physiques in the competition. Brisbane career The Bulldogs gave McLean the boot, before he was picked up in the 1991 pre-season draft as the first overall pick for the Brisbane Bears. He resurrected his career, winning the 1991 and 1993 best and fairest award at the Bears. He went on to play 87 games and kick 17 goals with the Bears, before playing the first game in 1997 with the newly merged Brisbane Lions before constant calf injury struck him down, forcing his retirement. Coaching career McLean returned to Darwin to coach his former club Nightcliff, he did so for five years with limited success before resigning at the end of 2004 to coach the Redland Football Club in the Queensland State League. At the end of the 2005, as Redland seemed destined for the wooden spoon, he resigned and returned to Darwin to again coach Nightcliff. In the 2005/06 season, McLean gave the Tigers an impressive season and reached the preliminary final before bowing out to eventual premiers, the Darwin Football Club. In the 2006/07 season, McLean became coach for the Southern Districts Football Club and won the premiership in his first year as coach with the club. In 2009, he became the head coach of the Northern Territory Football Club and coached their inaugural season in the Queensland Australian Football League (QAFL). In May 2016, he was announced as the new senior coach of the Waratah Football Club heading into the 2016/17 NTFL season. Aboriginal activist During his career he was a strong anti-racism advocate, and this continued post his career. He was a vital part of the Aboriginal All-Stars match up in Darwin, and was also named in the Indigenous Team of the Century.

The Court, following the English common law established in Kuruma v R, [1955] A.C. 197 (P.C.), held that judges had no discretion to exclude evidence whose admission would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The police arrested Wray in connection with a murder. Through the use of forceful interrogation techniques they managed to get inculpatory information from him and had him show the police where he left evidence of his crime. At trial the judge held that the evidence must be excluded. Martland, with Fauteux, Abbott, Ritchie, and Pigeon concurring, held that the judge did not have the discretion to exclude the evidence. They distinguished between unfair methods of collecting evidence, which should never be the basis of evidence exclusion, and unfair trial process, which should always result in exclusion of evidence. Neither of these two cases could be subject to any discretion. In dissent, Cartwright found that all the precedents pointed to a common notion that the accused cannot be forced to self-incriminate, which implied that a judge would necessarily require discretion on the exclusion of evidence.

The major industries of Bannu are cloth weaving, sugar mills and the manufacturing of cotton fabrics, machinery and equipment. It is famous for its weekly Jumma fair. The district forms a basin drained by the Kurram and Gambila (or Tochi) rivers, which originate in the hills of Waziristan. Although Bannu is surrounded by rugged and dry mountains, it is a fertile place, and early English visitors had been known to refer to it as a \\"paradise\\" ‚Äì see the beautiful description by Edwardes quoted by Thornton. The city of Bannu is the only urban area of any kind throughout the entire district of Bannu. In recent years, population growth has stagnated in the city, leading it to have fallen to be the second-largest city in Bannu Division and the 25th largest city in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Overview and history The town was founded in 1848 by Herbert Benjamin Edwardes, a lieutenant in the 1st Bengal European Fusiliers Regiment of the East India Company's private army. He ordered the construction of the fort ‚Äì named Dhulipgarh (Dalipgarh) in honour of the Maharajah of Lahore ‚Äì at the same time. At the time of its founding, the town was named Dhulipnagar (Dalipnagar). Its name was later changed to Edwardesabad in 1869. In 1903, it received its current name, Bannu. Bannu was used as the base of operations for all punitive expeditions undertaken by troops of the British empire to the Tochi Valley and the Waziristan frontier. A military road led from the town of Bannu toward Dera Ismail Khan. This road was built by military engineers under the supervision of a Bannu engineer, Ram N. Mullick. Mullick graduated from Banaras Engineering College and had served in Iraq and Lahore as an expert in heavy earth-moving equipment before the independence of Pakistan in 1947. According to the Imperial British Gazetteer, Bannu was described by the following: > [The population in 1901 was] 14,291, including cantonment and civil lines > (4,349). It was founded in 1848 by Lieutenant (afterwards Sir Herbert) > Edwardes, who selected the site for political reasons.

It is allopatric with the congener, the Red-breasted parakeet, Psittacula alexandri, except in the Andaman islands where they occur together. Taxonomy The long-tailed parakeet was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enlumin√©es D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Psittacus longicauda in his catalogue of the Planches Enlumin√©es. The type locality is Malacca on the southern region of the Malay Peninsula. The long-tailed parakeet is now placed in the genus Psittacula that was introduced by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1800. The name of the genus is a diminutive of the Latin word psittacus for a \\"parrot\\". The specific epithet longicauda combines the Latin longus meaning \\"long\\" and cauda meaning \\"tail\\". Five subspecies are currently recognized: *P. l. tytleri (Hume, 1874) ‚Äì Andaman long-tailed parakeet ‚Äì Andaman and Coco Islands *P. l. nicobarica (Gould, 1857) ‚Äì Nicobar long-tailed parakeet ‚Äì Nicobar Islands *P. l. modesta (Fraser, 1845) ‚Äì Enggano long-tailed parakeet ‚Äì Enggano Island *P. l. longicauda (Boddaert, 1783) ‚Äì common long-tailed parakeet ‚Äì south Malay Peninsula, Singapore, Sumatra, Nias, Bangka Island Anambas Islands, Borneo *P. l. defontainei Chasen, 1935 ‚Äì Natuna Islands  Description  It is mainly green with a long blue tail. The male has a black cap and red face. The female lacks the black cap and has less red.  Habitat  The long-tailed parakeet is able to live in a wide variety of habitats such as in swamp forests, lowland evergreen forest, oil palm plantations, coconut plantations, gardens, public parks, and is a frequent visitor to agricultutal areas (especially those who yield tropical fruits and seeds). It is usually seen in elevations of up to 300 meters.  Ecology & Behavior  The long-tailed parakeet is an extremely social bird, always seen communicating with other birds of its species. Even though small groups are usually seen, flocks of thousands of birds have been in the Andaman Islands and Borneo. However, the large flocks tend to appear during breeding season. It is a colony breeder. Birds on the Malay Peninsula tend to breed from December to February while birds on the Nicobar and Andaman Islands tend to breed from February to March. Females tend to lay a clutch of 2 to 4 eggs approximately 30.5 x 24.5mm. It usually takes about 23 to 24 days for the eggs to hatch. Chicks fledge at around 7 weeks old. Its diet consists of a variety of berries, papaya, areca nuts, a wide variety of cultivated and wild fruit, seeds, and cultivated grains such as corn. It is a curious species, as it is often seen playing with sticks or other materials found in its environment.  Threats  Much of the long- tailed parakeet's natural habitat is threatened by deforestation and illegal logging. Capture for the illegal pet trade is also a threat to the survival of this species.

The National Union Catalog (NUC) is a printed catalog of books catalogued by the Library of Congress and other American and Canadian libraries, issued beginning in the 1950s. The National Union Catalog is divided into two series: the Pre-1956 Imprints is a 754-volume set containing all older records in a consolidated alphabetical format, while post-1955 volumes continue to be published serially. Since 1983, the NUC has been issued on microfiche. It is not related to the National Union Catalog of Manuscript Collections (NUCMC).  Pre-1956 Imprints  The National Union Catalog of Pre-1956 Imprints, a set of 754 volumes, largely superseded the older Library of Congress Catalog of printed books, and included printed works published before 1956 which are held by major American and Canadian libraries. It is sometimes referred to as the Mansell, after its publisher. This set is a massive bibliography compiled during the period from 1968 to 1981. It contains photocopies of printed catalog cards from major American and Canadian libraries, arranged alphabetically by author's last name, or by title for books that have no author, such as the Bible. The NUC of Pre-1956 Imprints was an important resource for verifying bibliographic information and finding copies of books before the advent of large electronic bibliographic databases, such as WorldCat; the massive size and weight of the set make it less useful now. However, given that approximately 27% of the books listed in the NUC Pre-1956 Imprints were not in listed WorldCat as of 2005 (25% in 2008), it remains an extremely valuable tool for researchers. The complete title of this work describes its purpose and scope: :The National Union Catalog Pre-1956 Imprints: A Cumulative Author List Representing Library of Congress Printed Cards and Titles Reported by Other American Libraries, Compiled and Edited with the Cooperation of the Library of Congress and the National Union Subcommittee of the Resources Committee of the Resources and Technical Services Division, American Library Association. The NUC of Pre-1956 Imprints is published in 754 volumes, containing over 528,000 pages. The set takes up approximately of shelf space. It weighs three tons. Project history The Library of Congress began its union catalog project in 1901 in an attempt to locate and note the location of a copy of every important book in the United States. With financial assistance from John D. Rockefeller Jr., the collection grew to over 11 million cards. Copies of these cards were distributed to a number of libraries around the country. Eventually the cards for all materials catalogued by the cooperating libraries were reproduced and issued serially in printed volumes as the National Union Catalog, supplementing the Library of Congress Catalog of Printed Books. Monthly NUC catalogs were cumulated quarterly, annually, and multi-annually. In an effort to simplify research, it was decided in the 1960s to collect and publish all of the references to pre-1956 imprints in a single alphabetical listing. Mansell Information/Publishing Ltd., the company which created the British Museum library catalog, won the contract to publish the proposed union catalog. Over the next 14 years, about five 600-page volumes were published each month until the NUC of Pre-1956 Imprints was completed, largely superseding the older Library of Congress Catalog of Printed Books.

Spatial filtering is commonly used to \\"clean up\\" the output of lasers, removing aberrations in the beam due to imperfect, dirty, or damaged optics, or due to variations in the laser gain medium itself. This filtering can be applied to transmit a pure transverse mode from a multimode laser while blocking other modes emitted from the optical resonator. The term \\"filtering\\" indicates that the desirable structural features of the original source pass through the filter, while the undesirable features are blocked. Apparatus which follows the filter effectively sees a higher-quality but lower-powered image of the source, instead of the actual source directly. An example of the use of spatial filter can be seen in advanced setup of micro-Raman spectroscopy. A computer- generated example of an Airy disk, point-source diffraction pattern. In spatial filtering, a lens is used to focus the beam. Because of diffraction, a beam that is not a perfect plane wave will not focus to a single spot, but rather will produce a pattern of light and dark regions in the focal plane. For example, an imperfect beam might form a bright spot surrounded by a series of concentric rings, as shown in the figure to the right. It can be shown that this two-dimensional pattern is the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the initial beam's transverse intensity distribution. In this context, the focal plane is often called the transform plane. Light in the very center of the transform pattern corresponds to a perfect, wide plane wave. Other light corresponds to \\"structure\\" in the beam, with light further from the central spot corresponding to structure with higher spatial frequency. A pattern with very fine details will produce light very far from the transform plane's central spot. In the example above, the large central spot and rings of light surrounding it are due to the structure resulting when the beam passed through a circular aperture. The spot is enlarged because the beam is limited by the aperture to a finite size, and the rings relate to the sharp edges of the beam created by the edges of the aperture. This pattern is called an Airy pattern, after its discoverer George Airy. By altering the distribution of light in the transform plane and using another lens to reform the collimated beam, the structure of the beam can be altered. The most common way of doing this is to place an aperture in the beam that allows the desired light to pass, while blocking light that corresponds to undesired structure in the beam. In particular, a small circular aperture or \\"pinhole\\" that passes only the central bright spot can remove nearly all fine structure from the beam, producing a smooth transverse intensity profile, which may be almost a perfect gaussian beam. With good optics and a very small pinhole, one could even approximate a plane wave. In practice, the diameter of the aperture is chosen based on the focal length of the lens, the diameter and quality of the input beam, and its wavelength (longer wavelengths require larger apertures). If the hole is too small, the beam quality is greatly improved but the power is greatly reduced. If the hole is too large, the beam quality may not be improved as much as desired. The size of aperture that can be used also depends on the size and quality of the optics. To use a very small pinhole, one must use a focusing lens with a low f-number, and ideally the lens should not add significant aberrations to the beam. The design of such a lens becomes increasingly more difficult as the f-number decreases. In practice, the most commonly used configuration is to use a microscope objective lens for focusing the beam, and an aperture made by punching a small, precise, hole in a piece of thick metal foil. Such assemblies are available commercially. Spherical waves By omitting the second lens that reforms the collimated beam, the filter aperture closely approximates an intense point source, which produces light that approximates a spherical wavefront. A smaller aperture implements a closer approximation of a point source, which in turn produces a more nearly spherical wavefront.

Identification of T-34 variants can be complicated. Turret castings, superficial details, and equipment differed between factories; new features were added in the middle of production runs, or retrofitted to older tanks; damaged tanks were rebuilt, sometimes with the addition of newer-model equipment and even new turrets.Zaloga, Steven J. and James Grandsen. T-34 In Action. Carrollton, Texas: Squadron/Signal Publications, 1983. Some tanks had appliqu√© armor made of scrap steel of varying thickness welded onto the hull and turret; these tanks are called s ekranami (\\"with screens\\"), although this was never an official designation for any T-34 variant.  Model naming Since the break-up of the Soviet Union, newly declassified sources have demonstrated that all T-34s with the original turret and F-34 gun (conventionally known as Models 1941 and 1942) were officially called \\"Model 1941\\", and hexagonal-turret T-34 (Model 1943) was officially called \\"Model 1942\\". German intelligence in World War II referred to the two main production models as T-34/76 and T-34/85, with minor models receiving letter designations such as T-34/76A‚Äîthis nomenclature has been widely used in the west, especially in popular literature. Since at least the 1980s, many academic sources (notably AFV expert Steven Zaloga) have used Soviet-style nomenclature: T-34 and T-34-85, with minor models distinguished by year: T-34 Model 1940. (This page has adopted that convention.) Because many different factories manufactured T-34s, with components built by subcontractors, the listing below merely gives a broad overview and does not capture every possible variant. Also, not every factory implemented all model changes at the same time.

Due to a shortage of new V-2 diesel engines, the initial production run from the Gorky factory was equipped with the BT tank's MT-17 gasoline-powered engine and an inferior transmission and clutch (Zheltov 2001:40‚Äì42). ** ' () - This production model was built in 1941, with a heavier armor, a cast or welded two-man turret, and the superior F-34 tank gun. ** ' () - This was a production model built in 1942, with increased armor protection and many simplified components. It had new 'waffle' tracks, new wheel patterns, a new driver's hatch and a round transmission access cover. Some had the headlight moved to the left side of the hull. Most were equipped with cast two-man turrets although a few welded ones remained. ** ' (, E, and F) - This production model was built from May 1942 to 1944, with a cast or pressed hexagonal turret. It was nicknamed \\"Mickey Mouse\\" by the Germans because of its appearance with the twin round turret roof hatches open. Official Soviet military designation was Model 1942. Turrets manufactured in different factories had minor variations, sometimes called \\"hard-edge\\", \\"soft-edge\\", and \\"laminate\\" turrets, but in military service these details did not warrant different designations. *** Earlier production is sometimes called Model 1942/43, and was designated T-34/76D by German intelligence. *** Later production variants had a new commander's cupola. This variant was referred to as T-34/76E by the Germans. *** Turrets produced at Uralmash in Sverdlovsk (Yekaterinburg) had a distinctive rounded appearance because they were made in a special forge. Tanks produced with these turrets there and at Chelyabinsk were called T-34/76F by the Germans. ** ' - A very small number of T-34s were fitted with the ZiS-4 L/73 high-velocity 57 mm gun in 1941 and 1943 to be used as tank destroyers. This gun had better penetration than the 76.2 mm F-34 (140 mm of steel at 500 m, as opposed to 90 mm), but the small HE projectile was inadequate for use against unarmored targets. *** Only ten were produced and all were lost during fighting around Moscow in late 1941.

An external fuel pump was added to ease refueling. ** ' (sometimes called ) - This was a T-34-85 flamethrower tank, with the ATO-42 in place of the bow machine gun. ** ' - OKB #9 Factory #183 built one example armed with a 100mm ZIS-100. Attempts were also made to mount a 100mm D-10-34 in a T34-85 turret and a prototype T-44 turret. Due to the added weight of the new gun, the bow machine gunner and machine gun were removed. These models were not accepted into production because of damage caused to the turret ring when firing along with unacceptable recoil.

The gun is facing backwards to preserve the center of gravity. The mount is completely open apart from a mantlet around the base of the gun tube. The rear of the mount includes a folding platform on which the gun crew works when firing the howitzer. While the vehicle is moving the platform is folded to avoid blocking the driver's vision.  Former Yugoslavia  Tanks = Yugoslav Teski Tank Vozilo A on display at the military museum in the Kalemegdan fortress in Belgrade * ' () - This was a 1949 Yugoslav tank based on the T34 design. A total of nine prototypes were built. They were designed and built at the height of the danger from Soviet invasion when Yugoslavia was building up its weapons industry. They were designed by reverse engineering of the Soviet T-34-85 medium tank without any documentation. They are recognizable by their angled front hull corners, modified hull machine gun mantlet, streamlined turret with cylindrical cupola, muzzle brake on the gun, and external fuel tanks that appear to be notched to fit the hull. An alternate version existed, armed with a gun and a mantlet from the M47 Patton. Two examples survive. One of the prototypes is on display at the military museum in the Kalemegdan fortress in Belgrade. The other surviving example is in Banja Luka barracks.

Its main feature is a high-capacity double-stacked magazine designed for military and law enforcement use. In 1996, Walther discontinued the pistol in favour of the slightly lighter and smaller P88 Compact, which was also cheaper to manufacture. The Walther P88 is highly prized among collectors and sport shooters due to its accuracy ( groups at ) and high-quality construction. Variants Comparison (from left to right) SIG Sauer P226, TZ 99 (CZ 99), Walther P88, Bersa Thunder 9 P88 Compact The Compact is lighter and a bit smaller with only minor differences. The standard P88 was heavily criticised for being bulky, heavy and expensive; the Compact solved some of these issues. There were many complaints about the full-size model's slide stop as well. It was thought to be hard to reach and manipulate, requiring the user to shift the gun in hand to operate. This was corrected with the P88 Compact at the expense of losing a very popular feature; it's unique combination ambidextrous decocker and slide release. It was replaced with a CZ 99-style combination decocker and conventional slide stop/release. This allowed the pistol to function as a DAO (double action only) or conventional DA/SA. Both these pistols are fully ambidextrous with the exception of the compact's slide stop/release. Full ambidextrous control was an industry first and the original P88 likely would have sold well were it not for the high cost. Both models remain collectible.

Habitat H. bolina is a fairly common butterfly found in lightly wooded country, deciduous forests, thick and moist scrub, and the greener parts of human habitats. Mimicry To the west the female is monomorphic, mimicking species of the oriental and Australasian danaid genus Euploea. Eastwards H. bolina is frequently polymorphic and most forms are then non-mimetic. In areas where it resembles Euploea the butterfly has usually been designated a Batesian mimic. Life cycle and ecology H. bolina is known for maternal care, with the females guarding leaves where eggs have been laid. Males are also very territorial and site fidelity increases with age. Territories that enhance the detection of females are preferred. The female hovers over a plant to check for ants which will eat her eggs. After selecting a plant which has no ants on it, she lays at least one but often two to five eggs on the undersides of the leaves. Host plants Race bolina breeds on Sida rhombifolia, Elatostemma cuneatum, Portulaca oleracea, Laportea interrupta, Triumfetta pentandra, and Asystasia species. Other hosts include Elatostema cuneatum, Fleurya interrupta, Pseuderanthemum variabile, and Synedrella nodiflora. They are also known to feed on Urtica dioica and Malva species. Eggs The eggs are a pale, glassy green with longitudinal ridges except on the top. Caterpillar After about four days the eggs hatch. The caterpillars immediately disperse. They are black with an orange head. The last segment is also orange. The head bears a pair of long branched black horns. The body surface is also covered with long, branched, orangish black spines. These spines look whitish and transparent immediately after moulting, but soon become the usual orange. In later instars the spiracles are surrounded by thin, dirty orange rings. Infection by Wolbachia bacteria is known to exclusively kill male specimens. Pupa The pupa is suspended by just one point. It is brown with a grey tinge on the wings. The abdominal segments have distinct tubercles. The surface of the pupa is rough. The butterfly emerges after seven to eight days as pupae (female development is always a bit longer). Recent evolutionary changes On the Samoan Islands of Upolu and Savai'i, a parasite (probably Wolbachia) had been killing the male members of Hypolimnas bolina. The problem was so severe that by 2001, males made up only 1% of the population. However, in 2007, it was reported that within a span of just 10 generations (about 5 years), the males had evolved to develop immunity to the parasite, and the male population increased to nearly 40%..

Washington has previously been a member of the New England Patriots, Baltimore Ravens, Philadelphia Eagles, and the San Diego Chargers. Early years Washington was born in Stephens City, Virginia, where he attended Sherando High School, and was a letterman in football, basketball, and baseball. In football, he was a two-way starter as a quarterback and defensive back and as a senior he was an All-State selection. He twice led his team to the Virginia Class AA-Division 4 State Championship game, though the Warriors lost both times. Baseball career He was taken in the 10th round of the June 1997 professional baseball draft by the Florida Marlins and signed as a shortstop. Washington spent four years in the minor leagues, often rooming with future All-Star pitcher Josh Beckett. He never played higher than Class A. College career Washington spent two seasons at the University of Tennessee. As a 22-year-old freshman in 2001, he caught 70 passes for 1080 yards and seven touchdowns and made the freshman All-American team. In 2001, he etched his name in the Tennessee records book with 256 receiving yards on 11 catches in the regular season matchup with LSU. Considered a lock to be a first-round pick if he left early, Washington stayed for his sophomore year but was limited to four games due to injuries. After missing the first two games of that 2002 season with a knee sprain, and suffered a concussion October 12 at Georgia that sidelined him for the remainder of the season. He underwent surgery on November 19 to fuse two vertebrae in his neck. Washington finished his two-year career with 93 catches for 1523 yards and eight touchdowns. He was an Arts and sciences major.

It resembled the Alexandrine parakeet, but was smaller and lacked the pink colour in its collar. The species is suspected to have become extinct due to intense persecution by farmers and coconut plantation owners. Taxonomy Only known live depiction, by Marianne North, 1883 The Seychelles parakeet was named Palaeornis wardi as by the British ornithologist Edward Newton in 1867. It was endemic to Mah√© and Silhouette and was once sighted on Praslin. Ten specimens exist today. Evolution Phylogenetic studies suggest that the species diverged from the Alexandrine parakeet through isolation of populations that dispersed through the Indian subcontinent into Seychelles about 11 million years ago when sea levels were much lower. The following cladogram shows the phylogenetic position of the Seychelles parakeet, according to Jackson et al., 2015: A 2017 study found it to be close to the Mascarene parrot. Description Illustration of a male, by Keulemans, 1907 The Seychelles parakeet was a medium-sized parrot with a length of about . It was green with a large red beak, a red shoulder patch, and a long tail. The male had a narrow, black cheek band and black collar which the female and juvenile lacked. Behaviour and ecology P. wardi was endemic to Mah√© and Silhouette, Seychelles, with a sight record from Praslin. The Seychelles parakeet is believed to have had a diet of insects found in the bushes or trees, and probably also consumed fruit and seeds. Extinction It was rare when described even in 1867. The last specimens were collected by Warry in 1881, and the last birds recorded in captivity on Silhouette in 1883. The species was extinct by 1906 when Nicoll visited the island. It seems to have been affected by the felling of forests to make way for coconut plantations, and died out as a result of being killed by farmers protecting their maize crops.

It is found in Southeast Asia from north-eastern India to Vietnam. The binomial of this bird commemorates the German naturalist and explorer Otto Finsch.  Description  Its face is grey/green, and the rest of its head is dull green with faint pale green band below cheeks to hindcrown and its wing are patch absent and has a long tail.  Distribution & Population  The grey headed parakeet has a wide range in Southeast Asia. It is found in most of Vietnam, the entire country of Laos, most of eastern Cambodia, northern Thailand, in most of Myanmar (except for Tanintharyi Region), in the Yunnan province of China, in far east Bangladesh (extremely rare), nearly all of Northeast India, and far southeast Bhutan. The global population size is not known, but this bird is reported to be uncommon in China, with varying statuses everywhere else. From Khonoma, Nagaland, India.  Habitat  Psittacula finschii is found in elevations of up to 2,700 meters in forests consisting of oak, teak, pine, and cedar trees. It also resides on deciduous forest hillsides, farmland with scattered trees. In Cambodia, it regularly occurs in areas with evergreen and semi-evergreen vegetation.  Ecology  The grey headed parakeet has a widely varied diet of different species of leaf buds, seeds, fruit, berries, and flowers. It is often seen in flocks or family parties, with larger groups reported. It is usually a resident bird, with some seasonal altitudinal movement in response to food availability. It often gathers in large flocks to roost at dusk. After their breeding season from January‚ÄìMarch, females often lay a clutch of 4-5 eggs that are around 28.5 x 22.0mm.  Threats  The grey-headed parakeet is often captured in the exotic bird trade and many are locally kept as pets. They tend to be popular in some small villages in southern China and surrounding areas. The constant trapping of birds is greatly affecting the wild population. Deforestation and logging of the bird's natural forest habitat is also making a negative impact on the parakeet's population. The country of Laos and its uninhabited forest hills seems to act as a safe haven for the species.

History Tuareg tanaghilt or zakkat (the Agadez Cross or Croix d'Agadez) Scouting in Niger was started in 1947 under the auspices of French Scouting. The movement was disbanded by the military regime in the 1970s. In 1993, the Roman Catholic Church and the National Directory for the Youth restarted Scouting, supported by the Scouts de France. The Association became a member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement in 1996. Program=Activities Scouts in Niger are active in the Africa Region and attend many International Scout camps and Jamborees with their African neighbors. One Scout attended the 19th World Scout Jamboree in Chile in 1998 as part of the West Africa contingent. Faced with the 2005-06 Niger food crisis, in May 2005, the government of Niger issued a call for national and international solidarity in a bid to offer help to nearly 3.6 million in distress. In order to participate in the national solidarity efforts, the Association des Scouts du Niger appealed to the international Scout fraternity, through a project dubbed Scouts du Niger contre la faim (Scouts of Niger Against Hunger), funded by L√´tzebuerger Guiden a Scouten. In addition, UNFPA had recourse to the Scouts of Niger for the implementation of a project of food distribution to pregnant and breastfeeding women in the Agadez and Zinder areas. According to the Chief Commissioner, Yazi Oumarou, with the support from Guides et Scouts du Luxembourg, food (sorghum and millet) was bought and stored to be resold at an affordable price, to the population of the catchment area. Scouts were involved in gardening in plots with access to water, that were given out by the local authorities. After harvesting, Scouts sold the produce to their communities.

July 1980 Vol.3 No.7 pg.81) was a professional bicycle motocross (BMX) racer. Nicknamed \\"Scary Harry Leary\\", and later \\"Turbo\\", the former for his aggressive racing style,BMX Action Bike October/November 1982 Issue 4 pg.37 the latter was a moniker coined by Bicycle Motocross Action magazine when he \\"Turboed\\" himself into finishing National No. 2 in both the American Bicycle Association (ABA) and the National Bicycle League (NBL) in 1981 after being relatively far back in the national standings during that year. His prime competitive years were from 1978 to 1985. He officially retired from BMX Senior pro (\\"AA\\" in the ABA and \\"A\\" (Elite Men) in the NBL) racing in 1989, and for the previous three years he was largely inactive and served as Diamond Back's factory team manager. He came out of \\"retirement\\" in the early 1990s to race in the ABA's Veteran Pro class and is still racing at 48 years of age. One of the most respected racers in BMX history, his career was not as laden with titles as many of his contemporaries. His career was plagued by many injuries, in particular his knees which cut many promising seasons off and required surgery. Also, he had trouble dealing with the fame, as limited to the BMX world as it was, that his career brought. He went as far as to attend a sports medicine clinic for stress management in July 1984.Super BMX November 1984 Vol.11 No.11 pg.5 He met many stars of the more established sports at the facility. The stresses that come with the burden of fame was and is a widespread if little discussed aspect in the career of a top amateur or professional athlete. Perhaps despite his attendance of the clinic, Harry Leary could never really get the psychological aspect of the sport, similar to Tommy Brackens but even more so. In addition, while Tommy had a problem with attitude but remained physically healthy for the vast majority of his career, Harry had both mental attitude and physical injury to contend with. His physical misfortunes often happened when he was on a streak of doing well, cutting promising seasons off, perhaps a No. 1 season. He never won a major title as a top amateur or professional, his biggest win being the $5000 first place award at the 1982 Murray World Cup. He won a measure of redemption when he won back to back ABA Veteran Pro No. 1's in 1993 & 1994 against many of his 1980s peers. He later raced well into his 40s in The Veterans Pro class (which is similar in concept to golf's Champions Tour). In October 2007 he reclassified as an amateur and 30 years of professional racing came to an end. He currently races in the 36 & Over Expert Class.VintageBMX topic Harry Leary Reclassed To Amateur He raced as recently the ABA So. Cal.

Racing career milestones Note: In the early days of professional racing, 1976 and prior, many tracks offered small purse prize money to the older racers of an event, even before the official sanctioning bodies offered prize money in formal divisions themselves. Hence early professionals like Stu Thomsen turning \\"pro\\" in 1975 at 16 years old racing for small amounts of money at track events when offered even before the NBA, regarded as the first true national BMX sanctioning body, had a professional division. The NBA was the first sanctioning body to establish one, beginning in 1977. For the sake of consistency and standardization noted professional first are for the first pro races for prize money offered by official BMX sanctioning bodies and not independent track events.

Like a lot of notable retired pros, they didn't stop racing completely. He raced the two day, two event 1991 ABA Fall Nationals with a fourth in Pro Cruiser and a third in Pro Open on Saturday. While he was retired from the top competition in the \\"A\\" pro class (\\"AA\\" in ABA parlance) point and money chases, he was reclassified as an \\"B\\" pro (\\"A\\" pro in ABA parlance) and later as a Veteran pro in the 20\\" class and raced competitively well into his mid 40s. In 2007 he ended his professional career and reclassified himself as an amateur, still racing at 48 years of age. *At the time there was no separate pro class for pros due to the relatively small number of pros. They raced with the 16 Experts, making it a Pro/Am class essentially. This is why during the early years of the pro division the national number one racer of a sanctioning body could be either an amateur or professional. This practice continued until the NBA's 1979 season in which the pros earned separate pro points and a separate pro plate from the amateurs.

It involves launching a bicycle to a great height off a ramp or dirt berm. Near the apex of the jump, the rider turns the handlebars of his bicycle until they are practically facing backwards. He also kicks the rear portion of the bicycle to the side until it is 90 degrees to the direction of travel. As he does this, his upper body twists to follow it around as he maintains his grip on the bars, his back almost completely pointing toward his direction of travel and his face almost completely pointing rearward, as if trying to execute a quick 180-degree turn in mid air. At this extreme position lower the shin of his leg, either his left or right depending in which direction he turned the bars, is resting on the top tube of the frame of his bicycle. His feet ideally stay in contact with the pedals. He maintains this position for a second at most and then uncoils himself before landing. The whole maneuver takes about one to two seconds. Many have claimed credit or were given credit for the invention of this jump, including Tim Judge and Jeff Utterback, but a photo in an October 1976 issue of Bicycle Motocross Weekly confirms that Leary was the first documented case of anyone doing a \\"Leary\\".BMX Action December 1983 Vol. 8 No. 12 pg. 10 At the time of the controversy, the maneuver was generically and neutrally known as a \\"Helicopter\\". Today, the modern variation of the \\"Leary\\" is called a \\"Lookback\\". This is an extreme version of the \\"Leary\\" in which when executed perfectly the knees are locked with the legs completely parallel with the ground, as is the bicycle, with the bicycle's head tube pointing straight at the rider's crotch. The rider's feet are perfectly flat on the pedals with the crank arms perpendicular with the ground. Another variation is the \\"Turndown\\". The rider has the bicycle pointing up, i.e. the front end of the bike pointing toward the sky with the rider twisted around and facing toward the back wheel with the bicycle's head tube pointing toward the rider's chest. An even more extreme variations is the \\"Turndown Flip\\", which is a \\"Leary\\" with the rear wheel almost completely pointing toward the sky at as much as a 70 degree angle. *Harry Leary was a founding member of the Professional Racing Organization (PRO) racers guild in 1977.BMX Action December 1986 Vol.11 No.12 pg. 30 *Harry Leary is a 1986 Inductee of the ABA BMX Hall of Fame Significant injuries *Tore the medial meniscus cartilage in his left knee when fellow pro Clint Miller ran into him in a race at the July 24, 1982 NBL/IBMXF Huffy World Championship in Dayton, Ohio.BMX Plus!

In mid 1980, just after he was picked up by Diamondback he received a one-month suspension at his local track in West Covina, California for striking a fellow racer in which he got into an altercation with. It was apparently not without provocation. Leary and this local pro racer were at odds with each other for actions on the race course for their mutually aggressive style of racing. As Leary explained in the October/November 1982 issue of the British publication BMX Action Bike: Miscellaneous *He was the first BMX racer to have his signature on a BMX bicycle,BMX Action Bike October/November 1982 Iss.4 pg.36 namely the Harry Leary Turbo. Racers before him has had bikes named after them, but not with their signature physically on the product. According to Leary, no racer previously did because the racer didn't want his name associated so closely with the product that if it turned out to be a poor product then his name would suffer in reputation: Post Racing Career *Doesn't have a post racing career. As is the norm with BMXers, despite \\"officially\\" retiring after the 1989 ABA Grand National and after a short layoff he started what amounted to a second BMX career in Veteran Pro. Also as is the norm with many BMXers he also races mountain bikes, earning a Silver Medal in the 1989 Mountain bike World Championship in the dual Dual Slalom class. In the next year he won a 1990 Bronze Medal, again in the Mountain Bike World Championship/Dual Slalom Class. He still races competitively in his first love of BMX, albeit in the Veteran Pro Class in the ABA. He is banging handlebars with fellow long time pros like Eric Rupe and Terry Tenette as of 2006. In 2007 30 years of Pro racing came to an end for Leary when he reclassified as an amateur and began racing in the ABA's 36 & over Expert 20\\" Class and the 46-50 24\\" Cruiser Class. *Mister Leary started and owns Leary Dirtwerx, a BMX component company that makes and sells BMX bicycle parts. *He also is a BMX track operator.

Chicana feminism challenges the stereotypes that Chicanas face across lines of gender, ethnicity, race, class, and sexuality. Most importantly, Chicana feminism serves as a movement, theory and praxis that helps women reclaim their existence between and among the Chicano Movement and American feminist movements.  Overview  In 1848, with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, Mexico ceded to the US: Arizona, California, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, and part of Colorado and Wyoming. Former citizens of Mexico living in those territories became US citizens. Therefore, during the twentieth century, Hispanic immigration to the United States began to slowly but steadily change American demographics. In Latin America, women at those times had to act according to social standards. In many Latin American cities, women were criticized for speaking to men they did not know whereas men were not criticized, but rather praised for doing so; being seen as heroic if they had multiple girlfriends, regardless of marital status. As a result, the women who immigrated hoped to change their social conditions by beginning a women's suffrage movement for Mexican American women. By 1940, Los Angeles was one of the cities with the densest Chicano population in the United States, resulting in even more women joining the movement in solidarity, such as Adelina Otero- Warren and Maria de G.E. Lopez. In the 1960s and ‚Äô70s, more groups began to fight for their rights in the United States, which had been disregarded until their outcry began. Emerging out of the identity movements of the 1960s, Chicana feminists created a distinctive trajectory and mapping of feminist political thought and practice that associated unique experiences with gender, race, class, and sexuality.\\"The Research Context\\", by A√≠da Hurtado. In Voicing Chicana Feminisms, by A√≠da Hurtado. (New York, NY: New York University Press, 2003). Unlike women of minority races, white women rarely had to deal with racism. Euro-American women combated this with the emergence of waves of feminism; the first wave addressed suffrage, while the second wave of feminism discussed issues of sexuality, public vs. private spheres, reproductive rights, and marital rape. Chicana feminists distinguished themselves from other feminist movements by offering critiques and responses to their exclusion from both the mainstream Chicano nationalist movement and the second wave feminist movement. One important way they were able to do this was through the inclusion of different varieties of the Spanish language, a vital component to the preservation of Chicana culture. Chicana feminism emphasizes that throughout history, Latin American women have been oppressed and abused in many different societies. In Latin America, just as in Europe, Asia, and Africa, many women were, for centuries, discriminated against by their fathers, brothers and husbands.  Origin  Chicana feminists challenged their prescribed role in la familia, and demanded to have the intersectional experiences that they faced recognized. Chicanas identify as being consciously aware, self-determined, proud of their roots, heritage, and experience while prioritizing La Raza. With the emergence of the Chicano Movement, the structure of Chicano families saw dramatic changes. Specifically, women began to question the role that they were assigned within the family and where their place was within the Chicano national struggle. In the seminal text ‚ÄúLa Chicana‚Äù, by Elizabeth Martinez, Martinez writes: \\"[La Chicana] is oppressed by the forces of racism, imperialism, and sexism. This can be said of all non- white women in the United States. Her oppression by the forces of racism and imperialism is similar to that endured by our men. Oppression by sexism, however, is hers alone.\\" Women also sought out to battle the internalized struggles of self-hatred rooted in the colonization of their people. This included breaking the mujer buena/mujer mala myth, in which the domestic Spanish Woman is viewed as good and the Indigenous Woman that is a part of the community is viewed as bad. Chicana feminist thought emerged as a response to patriarchy, racism, classism, and colonialism as well as a response to all the ways that these legacies of oppression have become internalized. According to Garcia (1989) the Chicana feminist movement was created to adhere to the specific issues which have affected Chicana women, and originated in the Chicano movement because women desired to be treated equally and have the acceptance to do what the Chicanos were doing. The Chicana feminist movement has certainly influenced many Chicana women to be more active and to defend their rights not just as single women but women in solidarity who come together forming a society with equal contribution. Chicana feminist Garcia (1989) has noted that awareness is the catalyst for change, which is what Chicana feminism is about. Chicana feminism is also about creating intersectionality.  Political organization (1940s‚Äì1970s)  Beginning in the 1940s, Mexican-Americans led a civil rights movement with a goal of achieving Mexican-American empowerment. By the 1960s, the Chicano Movement, also known as El Movimiento, became a prominent campaign in the lives of many Mexican-American workers and youth.Exploring the Chicana Feminist Movement In 1962, The United Farm Workers (UFW) organization was founded by C√©sar Ch√°vez, Dolores Huerta, Gilbert Pedilla and Philip Vera Cruz. The UFW worked to secure better working conditions for the Chicanx farmhands in California. Between the late 1960s through the 1970s, The Chicano Student Movement began in which students fought and organized for better quality education. In 1968, students from five California middle schools, whose student populations were 75% Latinx or more, organized together to walk out of their classrooms, demanding equality of education within their Los Angeles school district. The first efforts of organizing the Chicana Feminist Movement began in the later part of the 1960s. During the Chicano Movement, Chicana women formed committees within Chicano organizations. Similar to the organization of other groups in the Women's Movement, the Chicana feminists organized consciousness-raising groups and held conferences specific to the issues that Chicana women faced. The Farah Strike, 1972‚Äì1974, labeled the \\"strike of the century,\\" was organized and led by Mexican American women predominantly in El Paso, Texas. Employees of the Farah Manufacturing Company went on strike to stand for job security and their right to establish and join a union. Although community organizers were working toward empowering the Mexican-American community, the narrative of the Chicano Movement largely ignored the women that were involved with organizing during this time of civil disobedience. Chicana feminism serves to highlight a much greater movement than generally perceived; a variety of minority groups are given a platform to confront their oppressors whether that be racism, homophobia, and multiple other forms of social injustice. Chicana liberation unshackles individuals, as well as the broader group as a whole, allowing them to live lives as they desire ‚Äì commanding cultural respect and equality.Blea, Irene I. 1992. La Chicana and the Intersection of Race, Class, and Gender. New York, NY: Praeger Publishers. 146. Chicana feminists collectively realized the importance of connecting the issues of gender with need for improvement with respect to other civil liberties such as socioeconomic background, heritage, and many others.Roth, Benita. 2004. Separate Roads to Feminism. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press. 12. = Chicanas in the Brown Berets = The Brown Berets were a youth group that took on a more militant approach to organizing for the Mexican-American community formed in California in the late 1960s. They heavily valued strong bonds between women, stating that women Berets must acknowledge other women in the organization as hermanas en la lucha and encouraging them to stand together. Membership in the Brown Berets helped to give Chicanas autonomy, and the ability to express their own political views without fear. = Chicana feminist organization = The 1969 Chicano Youth Liberation Conference began the Chicano Movement and eventually, MEChA. At the conference women began to get involved in the male-dominated dialogue to address feminist concerns. At the first National Chicana Conference held in Houston, Texas in May 1971, over 600 women organized to discuss issues regarding equal access to education, reproductive justice, formation of childcare centers, and more (Smith 2002). While the event was the first major gathering of its kind, the conference itself was fraught with discord as Chicanas from geographically and ideologically divergent positions sparred over the role of feminism within the Chicano movement. These conflicts led to a walkout on the final day of the conference. Revolutionary Chicanas during this time period, while critiquing the inability of the mainstream Chicano nationalist movements to address sexism and misogyny, simultaneously renounced the mainstream Second Wave feminist movement for its inability to include racism and classism in their politics. Chicanas during this time felt excluded from mainstream feminist movements because they had different needs, concerns and demands. Through persistent objections to their exclusions women have gone from being called Chicano women to Chicanas to introducing the adoption of a/o or o/a as a way of acknowledging both genders when discussing the community. Chicanas demanded free day-care centers and a reform of the welfare system, they sought to fight against all three structures of oppression they faced, including sexism, but also prioritizing racism and imperialism. One of the First Chicana organizations was the Comisi√≥n Femenil Mexicana Nacional (CFMN), founded in 1973. The concept for the CFMN originated during the National Chicano Issues Conference when a group of attending Chicanas noticed that their concerns were not adequately addressed at the Chicano conference. The women met outside of the conference and drafted a framework for the CFMN that established them as active and knowledgeable community leaders of a people's movement.  Female archetypes  Central to much of Chicana feminism is a reclaiming of the female archetypes La Virgen de Guadalupe, La Llorona, and La Malinche.\\"The Research Context\\", by A√≠da Hurtado. In Voicing Chicana Feminisms, by A√≠da Hurtado These archetypes have prevented Chicanas from achieving sexual and bodily agency due to the ways they have been historically constructed as negative categories through the lenses of patriarchy and colonialism. Shifting the discourse from a traditional (patriarchal) representation of these archetypes to a de-colonial feminist understanding of them is a crucial element of contemporary Chicana feminism, and represents the starting point for a reclamation of Chicana female power, sexuality, and spirituality. La Virgen de Guadalupe and La Malinche have become symbolic means of suppressing Chicana women's sexuality through the patriarchal dichotomy of puta/virgin, the positive role model and the negative one, historically and continuously held up before Mexican women as icons and mirrors in which to examine their own self-image and define their self-esteem. Gloria Anzald√∫a's canonical text addresses the subversive power of reclaiming indigenous spirituality to unlearn colonial and patriarchal constructions and restrictions on women, their sexuality, and understandings of motherhood. Anzald√∫a writes, \\"I will no longer be made to feel ashamed of existing. I will have my voice: Indian, Spanish, white\\". La Malinche is a victim of centuries of patriarchal myths that permeate the Mexican woman's consciousness, often without her awareness. Malintzin (also known as Do√±a Marina by the Spaniards or \\"La Malinche\\" post- Mexican independence from Spain) was born around 1505 to noble indigenous parents in rural Mexico. Since indigenous women were often used as pawns for political alliances at this time, she was betrayed by her parents and sold into slavery between the ages of 12‚Äì14, traded to Hernan Cort√©s as a concubine, and because of her intelligence and fluency in multiple languages, was promoted to his \\"wife\\" and diplomat. She served as Cort√©s's translator, playing a key role in the Spaniard's conquest of Tenochtitlan and, by extension, the conquest of Mexico. She bore Cort√©s a son, Mart√≠n, who is considered to be the first mestizo and the beginning of the \\"Mexican\\" race. After Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821, a scapegoat was needed to justify centuries of colonial rule. Because of Malintzin's relationship with Cort√©s and her role as translator and informant in Spain's conquest of Mexico, she was seen as a traitor to her race. By contrast, Chicana feminism calls for a different understanding. Since nationalism was a concept unknown to Indigenous people in the 16th century, Malintzin had no sense of herself as \\"Indian\\", making it impossible for her to show ethnic loyalty or conscientiously act as a traitor. Malintzin was one of millions of women who were traded and sold in Mexico pre-colonization. With no way to escape a group of men, and inevitably rape, Malintzin showed loyalty to Cort√©s to ensure her survival. La Malinche has become the representative of a female sexuality that is passive, \\"rape-able\\", and always guilty of betrayal. Rather than a traitor or a \\"whore\\", Chicana feminism calls for an understanding of her as an agent within her limited means, resisting rape and torture (as was common among her peers) by becoming a partner and translator to Cort√©s. Placing the blame for Mexico's conquest on Malintzin creates a foundation for placing upon women the responsibility to be the moral compasses of society and blames them for their sexuality, which is counterintuitive. It is important to understand Malintzin as a victim not of Cort√©s, but of myth. Chicana feminism calls for an understanding in which she should be praised for the adaptive resistance she exhibited that ultimately led to her survival. By challenging patriarchal and colonial representations, Chicana writers re-construct their relationship to the figure of La Malinche and these other powerful archetypes, and reclaim them in order to re-frame a spirituality and identity that is both decolonizing and empowering.Herrera, Cristina. Contemporary Chicana Literature: (Re)Writing the Maternal Script. Amherst: Cambria Press, 2014.  Cultural identities and spirituality  The term \\"Chicano\\" originates from Aztec indigenous peoples who pronounced it \\"meshicano\\" in the native Nahuatl language. However, historically the Spaniards had no \\"sh\\" in their vocabulary and pronounced it \\"mexicano\\" (spelled mexicano), a pronunciation that has been carried into the present. Historically, the term Chicano has not always been positive and empowering. The term Chicano was for a long time used in a demeaning manner, and was associated with newly arrived Mexican immigrants in the early twentieth century until it was later reclaimed by Chicana feminists with the emergence of the Chicano Nationalist Movement. The term was used to distinguish first-generation, American-born Mexican-Americans from the older generations of Mexican immigrants; two groups that were often separated by a language barrier. Most first-generation American Chicanos adopted English as their first language, with some Chicanos blending both English and Spanish to create a hybrid dialect or slang argot called cal√≥ (also called pachuco). The U.S. media, not being able to fully understand these emerging American identities, stigmatized Chicanos and Mexican in propagating the notion that came from a country of corruption, and that they were criminals, thieves, and immoral people. The definitions of Chicana/o in the United States are contested. Because many Chicana/os are born to parents who are immigrants from Mexico, one definition of Chicana/o is rooted in the idea that this identity straddles two different worlds. The first world is that of the country of origin from which their families descended from, such as Mexico, Guatemala, or El Salvador. Many Chicanos today, for example, continue to practice the religion, language, and culture of their respective family's countries of origin. Another definition of Chicano is rooted in the identity being completely embedded within the \\"American\\" culture. Many Chicana/os have assimilated into \\"American\\" culture and use English as their primary language. Despite these two distinctions in definition, some might argue that Chicanos are stigmatized by both cultures because they don't fit into either one completely. For this reason, one view of Chicano identity is that a new culture is created in order to resist oppression and navigate both worlds. Contemporary renditions of the word Chicano have been to replace the ‚ÄúCh‚Äù beginning with the letter X, making the word Xicano. This is significant because it recenters the Nahua language and pronunciation of the sound ‚Äúch‚Äù, tying the Xicana/o to indigenous roots and decentering Eurocentric ties to identity. The Ch is the fourth letter of the Spanish alphabet. Chicana feminism has also created another linguistic change, there is another ‚Äúx‚Äù at the end of Xicanx, and it is being used to be inclusive of others gender identities and move away from a colonial imposed binary and gendered language. The usage of Xicanx is due to the feminists trying to move back to indigenous roots as well as trying to create more space for Queer folk who have felt marginalized by previous Chicano/a movements.  Duality and \\"The New Mestiza\\"  The concept of \\"The New Mestiza\\" comes from feminist author Gloria Anzald√∫a. In her book, Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza, she writes: \\"In a constant state of mental nepantilism, an Aztec word meaning torn between ways, la mestiza is a product of the transfer of the cultural and spiritual values of one group to another. Being tricultural, monolingual, bilingual or multilingual, speaking a patois, and in a state of perpetual transition, the mestiza faces the dilemma of the mixed breed: which collectivity does the daughter of a dark-skinned mother listen to? [...] Within us and within la Cultura Chicana, commonly held beliefs of the white culture attack commonly held beliefs of the Mexican culture, and both attack commonly held beliefs of the indigenous culture. Subconsciously, we see an attack on ourselves and our beliefs as a treat and we attempt to block with a counterstance.\\" Anzaldua presents a mode of being for Chicanas, that honors their unique standpoint and lived experience. This theory of embodiment offers a mode of being for Chicanas who are constantly negotiating hybridity and cultural collision, and the ways that inform the way they are continuously making new knowledge and understandings of self, often time in relation to intersecting and various forms of oppression. This theory discloses how a counter-stance cannot be a way of life because it depends on hegemonic constructions of domination, in terms of race, nationality, and culture. A counter-stance locks one into a duel of oppressor and oppressed; locked in mortal combat, like the cop and the criminal, both are reduced to a common denominator of violence. Being solely reactionary means nothing is being created, revived or renewed in place of the dominant culture and that the dominant culture must remain dominant for counterstance to exist. For Anzaldua and this theory of embodiment, there must be space to create something new. The ‚Äúnew mestiza‚Äù was a canonical text that redefined what it meant to be Chicana. In this theory, being Chicana entails hybridity, contradictions, tolerance for ambiguity and plurality, nothing is rejected or excluded from histories and legacies of oppression. Further, this theory of embodiment calls for synthesizing all aspects of identity and creating new meanings, not simply balancing or coming together of different aspects of identity.  Mujerista  Mujerista was largely influenced by the African American women's \\"Womanist\\" approach proposed by Alice Walker. Mujerista was defined by Ada Mar√≠a Isasi-D√≠az in 1996. This Latina feminist identity draws from the main ideas of womanism by combating inequality and oppression through participation in social justice movements within the Latina/o community. Mujerismo is rooted in the relationships built with the community and emphasizes individual experiences in relation to \\"communal struggles\\"Galv√°n, R. T. (2006). Campesina epistemologies and pedagogies of the spirit: Examining women‚Äôs sobrevivencia. In D. Delgado Bernal, C. A. Elenes, F. E. Godinez, & S. Villenas (Eds.), Chicana/Latina education in everyday life: Feminista perspectives on pedagogy and epistemology (pp. 161‚Äì179). Albany: State University of New York Press. to redefine the Latina/o identity. Mujerismo represents the body of knowledge while Mujerista refers to the individual who identifies with these believes. The origins of these terms began with Gloria Anzald√∫a's This Bridge We Call Home (1987), Ana Castillo's Massacre of the Dreamer: Essays in Xicanisma (1994), and Gloria Anzald√∫a and Cherrie Moraga's This Bridge Called My Back (1984). Mujerista is a Latina-oriented ‚Äúwomanist‚Äù approach to everyday life and relationships. It emphasizes the need to connect the formal, public life of work and education with the private life of culture and the home by privileging cultural experiences. As such, it differs from Feminista which focuses on the historic context of the feminist movement. To be Mujerista is to integrate body, emotion, spirit and community into a single identity.Galv√°n, R. T. (2006). Campesina epistemologies and pedagogies of the spirit: Examining women‚Äôs sobrevivencia. In D. Delgado Bernal, C. A. Elenes, F. E. Godinez, & S. Villenas (Eds.), Chicana/Latina education in everyday life: Feminista perspectives on pedagogy and epistemology (pp. 161‚Äì179). Albany: State University of New York Press. Mujerismo recognizes how personal experiences are valuable sources of knowledge. The development of all these components form a foundation for collective action in the form of activism.  Nepantla spirituality  Nepantla is a Nahua word which translates to \\"in the middle of it\\" or \\"middle\\". Nepantla can be described as a concept or spirituality in which multiple realities are experienced at the same time (Duality). As a Chicana, understanding and having indigenous ancestral knowledge of spirituality plays an instrumental role in the path to healing, decolonization, cultural appreciation, self-understanding, and self-love. Nepantla is often associated with author Chicana feminist Gloria Anzald√∫a, who coined the term, \\"Nepantlera\\". \\"Nepantleras are threshold people; they move within and among multiple, often conflicting, worlds and refuse to align themselves exclusively with any single individual, group, or belief system.\\" Nepantla is a mode of being for the Chicana and informs the way she experiences the world and various systems of oppression.  Body politics  Encarnaci√≥n: Illness and Body Politics in Chicana Feminist Literature by Suzanne Bost discusses how Chicana feminism has changed the way Chicana women look at body politics. Feminism has moved beyond just looking at identity politics, it now looks at how ‚Äú[...]the intersections between particular bodies, cultural contexts, and political needs‚Äù. It now looks beyond just race, and incorporates intersectionality, and how mobility, accessibility, ability, caregivers and their roles in lives, work with the body of Chicanas. Examples of Frida Kahlo and her abilities are discussed, as well as Gloria Anzaldua's diabetes, to illustrated how ability must be discussed when talking about identity. Bost writes that ‚ÄúSince there is no single or constant locus of identification, our analyses must adapt to different cultural frameworks, shifting feelings, and matter that is fluid.[...] our thinking about bodies, identities, and politics must keep moving.‚Äù Bost uses examples of contemporary Chicana artists and literature to illustrate this: Chicana feminism has not ended; it is just manifesting in different ways now.  LGBT interventions  Chicana feminist theory evolved as a theory of embodiment and a theory of flesh due to the canonical works of Gloria Anzald√∫a and Cherrie Moraga, both of whom identify as queer. Queer interventions in Chicana feminist thought called for the inclusion and the honoring of the cultures‚Äô joteria. In La Conciencia de la Mestiza, Anzald√∫a writes that \\"the mestizo and the queer exist at this time and point on the evolutionary continuum for a purpose. We are blending that proves that all blood is intricately woven together and that we are spawned out of similar souls.\\" This intervention centers queerness as a focal part of liberation, a lived experience that cannot be ignored or excluded. In Queer Aztl√°n: the Reformation of Chicano Tribe, Cherrie Moraga questions the construction of Chicano identity in relation with queerness. Offering a critique of the exclusion of people of color from mainstream gay movements as well as the homophobia rampant in Chicano nationalist movements, Moraga also discusses Aztl√°n, the metaphysical land and nation that belongs to Chicano ideologies, as well as how the ideas within the communidad need to move forward into making new forms of culture and community in order to survive. \\"Feminist critics are committed to the preservation of Chicano culture, but we know that our culture will not survive marital rape, battering, incest, drug and alcohol abuse, AIDS, and the marginalization of lesbian daughters and gay sons\\". Moraga brings up criticisms of the Chicano movement and how it has been ignoring the issues within the movement itself, and that need to be addressed in order for the culture to be preserved rightfully. In Chicana Lesbians: Fear and Loathing in the Chicano Community Carla Trujillo discusses how being a Chicana lesbian is incredibly difficult due to their culture's expectations on family and heterosexuality. Chicana lesbians who do become mothers break this expectation and become liberated from the social norms of their culture. Trujillo argues that the lesbian existence itself disrupts the established norm of patriarchal oppression. She argues that Chicana lesbians are perceived as a threat because they challenge a male dominated Chicano movement; they raise the consciousness of many Chicana women regarding independence. She goes on to explain that Chicanas, whether they are lesbian or not, are taught to conform to certain modes of behavior regarding their sexuality: women are ‚Äútaught to suppress our sexual desires and needs by conceding all pleasures to the male.‚Äù In 1991, Carla Trujillo edited and compiled, the anthology Chicana Lesbians: The Girls Our Mothers Warned Us About (1991) was published by Third Woman Press. This anthology was controversial and banned because of its cover art, which was a piece by Ester Hernandez titled \\"La Ofrenda\\". Since its original publication, the book has been re-published and the cover art has been changed. This anthology includes poetry and essays by Chicana women creating new understandings of self through their sexuality and race. The pages listing external contributions give information about the writers and their histories, and make the book transparent about who is writing, and bringing visibility to various different names.  Chicana art  Art gives Chicana women a platform to voice their unique challenges and experiences, such as artists Ester Hernandez and Judite Hernandez. During the Chicano Movement, Chicanas used art to express their political and social resistance. Through different art mediums both past and contemporary, Chicana artists have continued to push the boundaries of traditional Mexican-American values. Chicana art utilizes many different mediums to express their views including murals, painting, photography, etc. to embody feminist themes. Chicana artists worked collaboratively often with not only other women but men as well. The momentum created from the Chicano Movement spurred a Chicano Renaissance among Chicanas and Chicanos. Political art was created by poets, writers, playwrights, and artists and used to defend against their oppression as second-class citizens. During the 1970s, Chicana feminist artists differed from their Anglo-feminist counterparts in the way they collaborated. Chicana feminist artists often utilized artistic collaborations and collectives that included men, while Anglo-feminist artists generally utilized women-only participants. Through different art mediums both past and contemporary, Chicana artists have continued to push the boundaries of traditional Mexican-American values. =Art centers/collectives= ;The Woman's Building (1973-1991) The Woman's Building opened in Los Angeles, CA in 1973. In addition to housing women-owned businesses, the center held multiple art galleries and studio spaces. Women of color, including Chicanas, historically experienced racism and discrimination within the building from white feminists. Not many Chicana artists were allowed to participate in the Woman's Building's exhibitions or shows. Chicana artists Olivia Sanchez and Rosalyn Mesquite were among the few included. Additionally, the group Las Chicanas exhibited Venas de la Mujer in 1976. ;Social Public Art Resource Center (SPARC) In 1976, co-founders Judy Baca (the only Chicana), Christina Schlesinger, and Donna Deitch established SPARC. SPARC consisted of studio and workshop spaces for artists. SPARC functioned as an art gallery and also kept records of murals. Today, SPARC is still active and similar to the past, encourages a space for Chicana/o community collaboration in cultural and artistic campaigns. ;Las Chicanas Las Chicanas' members were women only and included artists Judy Baca, Judithe Hern√°ndez, Olga Mu√±iz, and Josefina Quesada. In 1976, the group exhibited Venas de la Mujer in the Woman's Building. ;Los Four Muralist Judithe Hern√°ndez joined the all-male art collective in 1974 as its fifth member. The group already included Frank Romero, Beto de la Rocha, Gilbert Luj√°n, and Carlos Almar√°z. The collective was active in the 1970s through early 1980s. =Street art= ;Murals Murals were the preferred medium of street art used by Chicana artists during the Chicano Movement. Judy Baca led the first large scale project for SPARC, The Great Wall of Los Angeles. It took five summers to complete the 700 meter long mural. The mural was completed by Baca, Judithe Hern√°ndez, Olga Mu√±iz, Isabel Castro, Yreina Cerv√°ntez, and Patssi Valdez in addition to over 400 more artists and community youth. Located in Tujunga Flood Control Channel in the Valley Glen area of the San Fernando Valley, the mural depicts California's erased history of marginalized people of color and minorities. The Great Wall of Los Angeles, Judy Baca, Los Angeles, 1978 In 1989, Yreina Cerv√°ntez along with assistants Claudia Escobedes, Erick Montenegro, Vladimir Morales, and Sonia Ramos began the mural, La Ofrenda, located in downtown Los Angeles. The mural, a tribute to Latina/o farm workers, features Dolores Huerta at the center with two women on either side to represent women's contributions to the United Farmer Workers Movement. In addition to eight other murals, La Ofrenda was deemed historically significant by the Department of Cultural Affairs. In 2016, restoration on La Ofrenda began after graffiti and another mural were painted over it. La Ofrenda, Yreina Cerv√°ntez, Los Angeles, 1989 An exhibition curated by LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes and the California Historical Society featuring previously mistreated or censored murals chose Barbara Carrasco's L.A. History: A Mexican Perspective in addition to others. Beginning in 1981 and taking about eight months to finish, the mural consisted of 43 eight-foot panels which tell the history of Los Angeles up to 1981. Carrasco researched the history of Los Angeles and met with historians as she originally planned out the mural. The mural was halted after Carrasco refused alterations demanded from City Hall due to her depictions of formerly enslaved entrepreneur and philanthropist Biddy Mason, the internment of Japanese American citizens during World War II, and the 1943 Zoot Suit Riots. ;Performance art Performance art was not as popularly utilized among Chicana artists but it still had its supporters. Patssi Valdez was a member of the performance group Asco from the early 1970s to the mid-1980s. Asco's art spoke about the problems that arise from Chicanas/os unique experience residing at the intersection of racial, gender, and sexual oppression. ;Photography Laura Aguilar, known for her \\"compassionate photography,\\" which often involved using herself as the subject of her work but also individuals who lacked representation in the mainstream: Chicanas, the LBGTQ community, and women of different body types. During the 1990s, Aguilar photographed the patrons of an Eastside Los Angeles lesbian bar. Aguilar utilized her body in the desert as the subject of her photographs wherein she manipulated it to look sculpted from the landscape. In 1990, Aguilar created Three Eagles Flying, a three-panel photograph featuring herself half nude in the center panel with the flag of Mexico and the United States of opposite sides as her body is tied up by the rope and her face covered. The triptych represents the imprisonment she feels by the two cultures she belongs to. ;Other mediums In 2015, Guadalupe Rosales began the Instagram account which would become Veterans and Rucas (@veterans_and_rucas). What started as a way for Rosales family to connect over their shared culture through posting images of Chicana/o history and nostalgia soon grew to an archive dedicated to not only ‚Äô90 Chicana/o youth culture but also as far back as the 1940s. Additionally, Rosales has created art installations to display the archive away from its original digital format and exhibited solo shows Echoes of a Collective Memory and Legends Never Die, A Collective Memory. =Themes= ;La Virgen Yolanda L√≥pez and Ester Hernandez are two Chicana feminist artists who used reinterpretations of La Virgen de Guadalupe to empower Chicanas. La Virgen as a symbol of the challenges Chicanas face as a result of the unique oppression they experience religiously, culturally, and through their gender. * Ester Hern√°ndez references the sacred Virgen de Guadalupe in her painting, La Ofrenda (1988). Painting recognizes lesbian love, challenges traditional role of la familia. It defied the reverence and holiness of La Virgen by being depicted as a tattoo on a lesbian's back. La Virgen de Guadalupe Defendiendo los Derechos de Los Xicanos (1975) * Alma Lopez ‚Äì Our Lady of Controversy \\"Irreverent Apparition\\" (2001). This image is mixed media and is a sacrilegious depiction of La Virgen. See L.A. Times article ;Collective memory/correcting history The idea of sharing the erased history of Chicanas/os has been popular among Chicana artists beginning in the 1970s until present day. Judy Baca and Judithe Hern√°ndez have both utilized the theme or correcting history in reference to their mural works. In contemporary art, Guadalupe Rosales uses the theme of collective memory to share Chicana/o history and nostalgia. Gloria Evangelina Anzald√∫a (September 26, 1942 ‚Äì May 15, 2004)  Chicana literature  Since the 1970s, many Chicana writers (such as Cherr√≠e Moraga, Gloria Anzald√∫a and Ana Castillo) have expressed their own definitions of Chicana feminism through their books. Moraga and Anzald√∫a edited an anthology of writing by women of color titled This Bridge Called My Back(published by Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press) in the early 1980s. Cherr√≠e Moraga, along with Ana Castillo and Norma Alarc√≥n, adapted this anthology into a Spanish-language text titled Esta Puente, Mi Espalda: Voces de Mujeres Tercermundistas en los Estados Unidos. Anzald√∫a also published the bilingual (Spanish/English) anthology, Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza. Mariana Roma-Carmona, Alma G√≥mez, and Cherr√≠e Moraga published a collection of stories titled Cuentos: Stories by Latinas, also published by Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press. The first Chicana Feminist Journal was published in 1973, called the Encuentro Feminil: The First Chicana Feminist Journal, which was published by Anna Nieto Gomez. Juanita Ramos and the Latina Lesbian History Project compiled an anthology including tatiana de la tierra's first published poem, \\"De ambiente\\",De La Tierra, Tatiana. \\"Activist Latina Lesbian Publishing: esto no tiene nombre and conmoci√≥n.\\" I am Aztldn: The Personal Essay in Chicano Studies, ed. Chon A. Noriega and Wendy Belcher (Los Angeles: UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center Press, 2004) 172. and many oral histories of Latina lesbians called Compa√±eras: Latina Lesbians (1987). Chicana lesbian-feminist poet Gloria Anzaldua points out that labeling a writer based on their social position allows for readers to understand the writers' location in society. However, while it is important to recognize that identity characteristics situate the writer, they do not necessarily reflect their writing. Anzaldua notes that this type of labeling has the potential to marginalize those writers who do not conform to the dominant culture.Anzaldua, Gloria. (1994). To(o) Queer the Writer‚ÄîLoca, escritoria y chicana. from Betsy Warland, Ed., Inversions: Writings by Queer Dykes and Lesbians, 263-276. Vancouver: Press Gang Publishers.  Chicana music  Continually left absent from Chicano music history, many Chicana musical artists, such as Rita Vidaurri and Mar√≠a de Luz Flores Aceves, more commonly known as Lucha Reyes, from the 1940s and 50s, can be credited with many of strides that Chicana Feminist movements have made in the past century. For example, Vidaurri and Aceves were among the first mexicana women to wear charro pants while performing rancheras. By challenging their own conflicting backgrounds and ideologies, Chicana musicians have continually broken the gender norms of their culture, and therefore created a space for conversation and change in the Latino communities. There are many important figures in Chicana music history, each one giving a new social identity to Chicanas through their music. An important example of a Chicana musician is Rosita Fern√°ndez, an artist from San Antonio, Texas. Popular in the mid 20th century, she was called \\"San Antonio's First Lady of Song\\" by Lady Bird Johnson, the Tejano singer is a symbol of Chicana feminism for many Mexican Americans still today.

Santa Sabina is a Mexican rock band originally from Mexico City. The group was formed in 1989 by singer Rita Guerrero, bassist Alfonso \\"Poncho\\" Figueroa, guitarist Pablo Valero and keyboardist Jacobo Lieberman. Juan Sebastian Lach was keyboardist for a while. The name of the group honors the memory of Maria Sabina, the Mazatec shaman who lived in the southern state of Oaxaca. Santa Sabina are distinguished by their gothic rock and darkwave atmospheres, lyrics and stage presence. Their music, however, is perhaps best described as a variant of progressive rock which borrows heavily from jazz. History At the end of the 1980s, Guerrero left her hometown of Guadalajara to attend the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City to pursue a career in theatre. There, she met Poncho Figueroa, Pablo Valero and Jacobo Lieberman, who at that time were members of a jazz group called \\"the Psicotr√≥picos\\". \\"The Psicotr√≥picos\\" agreed to provide music for a play written for Guerrero's theatre class based on Franz Kafka's \\"Am√©rika\\". As they worked together, they realized they had a strong artistic affinity. After the dissolution of the \\"Psicotr√≥picos\\", they decided to form a new rock band that reflected their artistic vision. Although the group's lineup has changed through the years (as in the case of Pablo Valero and Jacobo Lieberman), the sound of the group, has evolved but remains faithful to its initial course. Juan Sebastian Lach was the group's keyboard player on all its albums up through \\"Mar Adentro En La Sangre.\\" Rather than replace him, the group instead invited cellist Leonel Perez and saxophone player Rodrigo Garibay to join. For its 15th Anniversary tour, Aldo Max replaced Garibay on saxophone. Guitarist Alex Otaola replaced Pablo Valero prior to the \\"Concierto Acustico\\" album. Drummer Patricio Iglesias left the band prior to \\"Mar Adentro En La Sangre.\\" Julio Diaz was the group's drummer after Iglesias. Discography=Live albums * Concierto Ac√∫stico (1994) * MTV Unplugged (1997) * XV Aniversario En Vivo (2005) Their first albums, Santa Sabina (1992), S√≠mbolos (1994, produced by Adrian Belew) and Babel (1996) were released through the now-defunct Mexican record label Culebra Records, a local branch of BMG Ariola. Their following albums, Mar adentro en la sangre (2001) and Espiral (2003), were independent productions. In 1997, they also recorded an album of their \\"unplugged\\" performance for MTV Latinoamerica called Santa Sabina Unplugged. In early 2006, the group released a double live album \\"XV Aniversario\\" which also included a DVD. After that, the group went on indefinite hiatus. Many members of the group have remained active in music. Rita Guerrero and Leonel Perez performed as part of Ensamble Galileo. This acoustic chamber group specializes in Renaissance-era music. Poncho Figueroa organized and produced a tribute album to Mexican rock music pioneer Rodrigo \\"Rockdrigo\\" Gonzalez. He has also been performing in a trio called Los Jaiguey, along with brothers Gustavo and Ricardo Jacob, who released their first album on November 2009 and in March 2013 released their second album entitled Haciendo Tiempo (Doing Time). Alex Otaola performed with La Barranca from 1998‚Äì2007 and has also been active as a guest guitarist on numerous projects. His solo album \\"Fractales\\" was released in September 2007. Patricio Iglesias was absent from the music scene for almost 8 years due to various health problems. The band participated in a benefit concert on his behalf in 2005. However, he apparently made a full recovery, and in 2006 he appeared on the Cafe Tacuba triple live album and DVD, and he also played on Otaola's \\"Fractales\\" album. Julio Diaz performed with Jorge \\"Ziggy\\" Fratta and others as well as performing concerts with his own group. Juan Sebastian Lach moved to Europe and studied for a doctorate in cognitive musicology. He continued to write music, often with microtonal applications that involved either chamber groups or players and computers. Death of Rita Guerrero Rita Guerrero, lead singer of the band, died on March 11, 2011, due to breast cancer, which was diagnosed in January, 2010. She had undergone chemotherapy, and as it was unsuccessful tried various treatments of alternative medicine. She was 47 at the time of her death.

Although a Protestant, he studied for two years at the Catholic Santa Clara College, (now Santa Clara University) in Santa Clara: one year at high-school level and one at college freshman level. Forced by lack of funds to leave, he worked as a draftsman, then entered the California School of Design in San Francisco (now the San Francisco Art Institute) in 1875. In 1876 he opened a portrait painting business in San Jose with Louis Lussier, continuing solo after Lussier's death in 1882. In 1889, he opened the Hill and Franklin Photography Studio and Art Gallery with J. C. Franklin.\\"Andrew P. Hill,\\" pp. vii-viii. When Franklin left a year later, he partnered with his mother-in-law, Laura Broughton Watkins, as the Hill and Watkins Photographers Studio.\\"Andrew P. Hill,\\" p. viii. For three years they were joined by Sidney Yard. In the earthquake of 1906, Hill's studio and the works there were destroyed, as was his painting The Murphy Party, which hung in the historical room of the California Pioneers Association in San Francisco and depicted the first settlers crossing Sunset Pass. He then turned to absentee management of a goldmine in Calaveras County, with little success, but continued to paint and photograph out of his home. Hill married Florence Maria Watkins of Santa Clara in April 1883. They had three sons, the first of whom died in infancy. Hill died in 1922. Big Basin In 1899, Hill was commissioned by the English Wide World Magazine to photograph the scenery at what is now called Big Trees Grove at Felton in the Santa Cruz Mountains after a forest fire had been put out with wine from a local winery. He had an altercation with the landowner, who demanded payment for allowing photographs of the Coast Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) trees and told him that they \\"were destined to become firewood and railroad ties.\\"Jeff Jones, \\"Henry Cowell History,\\" excerpted at The Creation of the Park, Henry Cowell Redwoods SP, California State Parks. At the turn of the century only 25% of the old growth Redwood forests remained. Hill vowed to save the redwoods for posterity. In his memoirs, he wrote of this decision: > I was a little angry, and somewhat disgusted, with my reception at the Santa > Cruz Big Trees. It made me think. There were still fifteen minutes until the > train time. Just as the gate closed, the thought flashed through my mind > that these trees, because of their size and antiquity, were among the > natural wonders of the world, and should be saved for posterity. I said to > myself, \\"I will start a campaign immediately to make a public park of the > place.\\" I argued that as I had been furnishing illustrations for a number of > writers, whom I knew quite well, that there was a latent force, which, when > awakened to a noble cause, would immediately respond, and perhaps arouse the > press of the whole country. Thus was born my idea of saving the > redwoods.Cited in Uprooted: How Redwood Landscapes Were Supplanted by Images > , Agencies for Utopia, Redwood Archive, Boyd Richard.com. His attention shifted to Big Basin when it was suggested that the redwoods there were taller and more important. On May 18, 1900, while camping there, he and others founded the Sempervirens Club, which decided that Big Basin should become a public park.Mildred Brooke Hoover, Historic Spots in California, 5th ed. rev.

Her rivalry with another popular geisha singer Katsutaro Kouta created the \\"Ichi-Katsu Era\\" in Japanese popular music history.  Early life  Ichimaru grew up in Japan with eleven siblings under harsh conditions. She left her family at the age of fourteen or fifteen to work at a geisha house. She spent much of her early years working at a hot springs spa in Asama, located in the Nagano Prefecture as an oshaku waitress. One time she was asked to sing by one of her customers, she was terribly embarrassed at her inability to sing and vowed to improve her skills. At the age of nineteen she moved to Tokyo and joined the Ichimatsuya Okiya, and took on her new name, Asakusa Ichimaru.  Recording career  In an effort to improve her singing skills when she moved to Tokyo, Ichimaru undertook shamisen and singing lessons from Enchiga Kiyomoto, who was a famous female shamisen artist. She made great progress but still felt she could get better. Ichimaru then undertook training with the Grand Head Master Enjudaiyu Kiyomoto V's son, Eijudaiyu. The training paid off and soon she was in great demand in not only her own geisha district but others around hers such as Yanagibashi, Akasaka and Shinbashi. Due to her great singing talent, Ichimaru was asked by The Victor Recording Company to sign a contract in 1931, along with another popular geisha singer, Katsutaro. She recorded her first song Chakkiri bushi (Picking tea song) which became a hit. Composed by a poet Kitahara Hakushu to promoted an amusement park. She followed her debut up with another hit, \\"Tenry≈´ Kudareba\\" (Down the Tenry≈´ River, 1933), which saw her become a superstar. Due to the success of her budding music career she decided to retire from being a geisha to concentrate solely on her singing career. In around mid-1930s was called \\"Katsu-Ichi Jidai\\" or \\"Ichi-Katsu Jidai\\", when she and Katsutaro Kouta became big rival on song and kimono style and other fees, which sometimes caused problems. Throughout the 1930s Ichimaru continued to record new songs and performed for Japanese troops at home and abroad. By the end of the decade her recording career had slowed down to a complete halt due to World War II. After the war in 1948 she began to record music again boost the morale of post-war Japan. Her first song on post-war is \\"Kurogami Romansu\\"(Romance of Black Hair). At the end of the 1940s she started her own radio program called \\"Mitsukoshi Calendar of Songs\\" which would continue to be a success for the next ten years. After the war Ichimaru became interested in United States culture, becoming greatly interested in jazz music. The result of this interest was the hit song \\"Shamisen Boogie Woogie\\", composed with jazz songwriter Ryoichi Hattori. In 1950, she became the first Japanese singer after World War II to be invited to Hawaii to perform, along with Noboru Kirishima, Akiko Futaba and Masao Koga. This performance was followed by other international concerts. During this time Ichimaru was singing for kabuki, and composing her own ko-uta, a style that would later become known as \\"Ichimaru Air\\". She also had a brief role in the 1951 film Tokyo File 212. The appearance of television in Japan made Ichimaru an important guest for music programs. In 1968, with others singers from 1930s era, she regularly appeared on \\"Natsukashi no Utagoe\\"(Nostalgic Songs). She continue to record song until 1985, her last song was \\" Showa Sanosa Bushi\\"(Sanosa Song of Showa). And continue appeared in television until she decided to retire in 1995.  Teaching career  In 1984, Ichimaru founded the Edo Ko-uta Ichiju Society with the hopes of popularizing Edo ko-uta. She had an active role in training students in this style, and continued to teach well into 80s. She was also granted the title of Head Master of Nakamura School of Edo Ko-uta in 1960, due to her successful singing career and her support of the style.  Legacy  Ichimaru died at the age of 90 in 1997, leaving a legacy of traditional folk music for modern day Japanese. Throughout her career she recorded two-hundred- seventy pieces of ha-uta, zokkyoku melodies and ko-uta, and won many prestigious awards including Geijutsusai Shorei Sho in 1970, Shiju Hoso (Imperial Order of the Purple Ribbon) in 1972 and Kun Yonto Zui-ho Sho (4th Imperial Order of the Sacred Treasure) in 1981. Her legacy continues to live on in the form of a generous donation of kimono, obi and memorabilia by Mrs. Fumi Suzuki, a friend of Ichimaru, to the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria in Canada and also by donations given to the Iida Museum in Nagano. The May‚ÄìJune 2003 issue of the magazine Arts of Asia contained a twenty-page article about Ichimaru, which included an eight-page spread dedicated to some of her kimono.

Raleigh is bordered on the west by the Frayser community (the boundary being the north-south Illinois Central Railroad tracks, which formed the Memphis city limits until 1975), on the east by the incorporated suburb of Bartlett, on the south by the Wolf River and Interstate 40, and on the north by the Memphis city limits. The former town of Raleigh was the first county seat of Shelby County, Tennessee. Geography Situated along a high bluff on the Wolf River, Raleigh is one of the highest points in the Memphis area. The old town's center, which was located around the intersection of today's James Road/Stage Road and Old Austin Peay Highway, had a commanding view of the river. Mary Winslow Chapman in her 1977 memoir I Remember Raleigh, provided these vivid descriptions of the Wolf River in its natural state (before channelization): :To form any picture of [the river's environs] we must forget what we now see and imagine the Wolf as it was then, a clear, spring-fed stream slipping silently along through the endless forest, where the unbroken shade shielded it from the fierce Southern sunshine and kept it flowing fresh and cool all summer long.... :The water was fresh and sweet, flowing out of the uncontaminated woods, but gradually this condition changed. As more and more land upstream was cultivated, more silt was washed into the river. After each rain it took longer for the stream to clear, and finally, with the establishment of the Penal Farm [today's Shelby Farms] with all its disagreeable effluvia, swimming became impossible.... :Gone now forever from this spot are the cane brake and the horses; the tall timber and the mysterious river, where hard by, on Austin Peay Bridge auto traffic streams triumphant, night and day in one unceasing roar, all oblivious of the life and history buried down below.M. Winslow Chapman, I Remember Raleigh, 1977, Riverside Press, Memphis. Excerpts are displayed here with permission of the author's estate. History Formerly an incorporated city, Raleigh was the county seat of Shelby County from 1824 to 1866, when the county courts were moved to Memphis, which had outstripped Raleigh in growth. In 1912, the town surrendered its charter and returned to unincorporated status.Tennessee historical marker at James Road and Old Austin Peay. The town was named by Joseph Graham, the first circuit clerk of the county, who was from the Raleigh, North Carolina area. The stone courthouse was situated between James and Fayette roads; a warehouse was later built on the site at 4216 Fayette Road. After the town lost its status as county seat in 1866, the courthouse was dismantled and the stone was used to construct the courthouse in nearby Bartlett, which had incorporated that same year.\\"History\\", City of Bartlett, Tennessee, retrieved 2019-06-28.

Her works have frequently made it to Essence magazine's \\"Black Board\\" bestseller lists. Early years Sandra Kitt was born in New York City as the eldest of four children. Her dream was to illustrate children's books. After graduating from the Music and Art High School in New York, she earned a bachelor's degree in fine arts from City College of New York. During college she worked part- time at the astronomy library at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Career Following her graduation, she spent several years working at a small advertising agency before returning to CUNY to pursue a master's degree. After completing half of the work required by her master's program, Kitt left school to become the head librarian at the astronomy library where she had previously worked. Although Kitt was comfortable with the job of cataloging the collection, she enrolled in classes at the Hayden Planetarium to learn more about astronomy so that she would be better at her job. Through these classes she met many guest speakers such as Carl Sagan and Isaac Asimov. In 1986, Asimov asked Kitt to illustrate a book he was writing on Halley's Comet. Writing career Kitt began writing in the early 1980s for her own enjoyment. In six weeks, she had transformed her first idea into a 500-page manuscript. She continued to work on her ideas, finishing two additional manuscripts in the next year and a half. Shortly after finishing her third story, Kitt read an article in The New York Times about an editor who was beginning a new line of books for Harlequin. Kitt called the editor, who requested two of Kitt's novels. Within a week, the editor had purchased both books, Adam and Eva and Rites of Spring. In 1984 all three of her novels were published, making Kitt the first black author to write for Harlequin. In 1995, Kitt emerged from the romance genre with her first mainstream novel, The Color of Love. This book has twice been optioned for film, once by HBO, and had nine printings by 2002. Her novels featured African-American characters, who rarely appeared in the gothic romances which she enjoyed reading. Kitt was one of the first authors within women's fiction to write from both the female and male point of view. Unafraid to tackle social issues in her works, Kitt has used her novels to study surrogate motherhood, abandoned children, race relations, and interracial/class differences. She has also often tackled interracial relationships. Kitt has been able to use her fine arts degree to illustrate one of her novels. In 1993 she designed and painted the cover that was eventually used for her novel Love Everlasting. In 2000, Kitt was nominated for an NAACP Image Award for contributing a story to the anthology Girlfriends. Kitt has been nominated three times for Romantic Times Reviewer's Choice Awards. She is a recipient of their Career Achievement Award. In 2003, Kitt retired from her job as a museum librarian. However, she remained active in the Special Libraries Association. In addition to her writing, Kitt teaches a publishing and creative writing course at a college. She has also written two film scripts and has interned with ABC for daytime soap operas.

The first Brooklands was a full-size luxury saloon, launched in 1992 to replace the Bentley Mulsanne and in turn succeeded by the Bentley Arnage in 1998. Bentley resurrected the nameplate in 2007 with the Brooklands Coup√©, a 2-door, 4-seater hardtop coup√© version of the Bentley Azure. It was made between 2008 and 2011 in limited numbers. These cars were named after Brooklands, a banked race track in Surrey, where Bentley obtained some of its greatest triumphs in the 1920s and 1930s. Brooklands (1992‚Äì1998) 1993 Bentley Brooklands The Bentley Brooklands was introduced in 1992 as a replacement for the Bentley Mulsanne S and Bentley Eight models. It was intended as a slightly cheaper alternative to the Bentley Turbo R, featuring the same styling, underpinnings and the Rolls-Royce 6.75-litre V8 engine, but initially without the more powerful model's turbocharger. A turbocharged version appeared in 1996. The Brooklands continued Bentley's relatively angular design theme, which was also used on contemporary Rolls- Royce vehicles, throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. The exterior design featured the classic Bentley waterfall grille as well as dual headlights with wraparound parking lights. As in many Bentley and Rolls-Royce vehicles, the Brooklands also featured the trademark descending bootlid and chrome B-pillars. The interior remained relatively unchanged from previous Bentley models, with more curvaceous design elements surrounding the leather-wrapped centre console. The steering wheel and interior door panels remained largely unchanged; the major change arrived in the form of relocating the gear selector to the centre console - for decades the standard practice among R-R and Bentley models utilised a steering column mounted selector. The interior continued to be surrounded by ample woodgrain which featured engraved, lighter-colored outlines on the door panels. In the U.S. prices for the Brooklands started at around $156,500. Specifications The 1992‚Äì1997 Brooklands was driven by a 6.75-litre Rolls-Royce V8 engine with a four-speed automatic transmission. The vehicle was rear-wheel drive, and featured independent front and rear suspension. While not as large as some other ultra- luxury cars, the Brooklands remained quite large with an overall length of and wheelbase of ( and respectively in SWB trim). 1996 update In autumn of 1996 Brooklands received an update in a form of light-pressure turbo, boosting power output to 300 bhp. Brooklands R In 1998, there also was a Brooklands R derivative available, with suspension upgrade borrowed from Turbo R model and with a light-pressure turbo, that should be seen as a replacement for standard Brooklands. Cars were badged as 'Brooklands R'. Brooklands Coup√© (2008‚Äì2011) The Bentley Brooklands Coup√© is a fixed-head version of the Bentley Azure (itself related to the Bentley Arnage), featuring a two- door, four-seater pillarless hardtop coup√© body, eliminating the B-pillars. It was unveiled at the 2007 Geneva Motor Show, to be built for the 2008 model year. As a hand-assembled car made in very small numbers, employing traditional coach-building techniques and craftsmanship skills in wood and leather, the Brooklands Coup√© was the true successor to the discontinued Bentley Continental R and T. Planned lifetime production was limited at 550 cars, and deliveries started in the first half of 2008. Specifications The Brooklands is powered by a 6.75-litre Bentley L Series twin-turbocharged OHV V8 engine, producing at 4,000 rpm and at 3,250 rpm, at the time the highest torque ever developed by a production petrol V8 engine. The engine was linked to a reinforced 6-speed ZF torque converter automatic, with a Tiptronic manual gear selection function. A Carbon fibre-reinforced Silicon Carbide (C/SiC) ceramic composite braking system with 14-inch SGL Carbon brake discs was optional, with 20-inch wheels only. =Performance= * : 5.0 seconds * : 5.3 seconds * Top speed: * : 11.7 seconds ReferencesExternal links * Bentley Motors official international portal * 2008 Brooklands on Bentley Motors' media site * Bentley Brooklands Image Gallery Brooklands Category:Flagship vehicles Category:Full-size vehicles Category:Luxury vehicles Category:Grand tourers Category:Coup√©s Category:Sedans Category:Rear- wheel-drive vehicles Category:Cars introduced in 1992 Category:2010s cars Category:Cars introduced in 2008 ","title":"Bentley Brooklands"},{"id":"3770231","text":"The Palace of Justice (Malay: Istana Kehakiman; Jawi: ÿßŸäÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ ŸÉÿ≠ÿßŸÉŸäŸÖŸÜ) houses the Malaysian Court of Appeal and Federal Court, which moved to Putrajaya from the Sultan Abdul Samad Building in Kuala Lumpur in the early 2000s.  History  Side view of the palace of Justice Due to the need for a proper office of the head of the judicial system in Malaysia, a location within the Precinct 3 of Putrajaya was identified for this purpose. aQidea Architect was once again called to be commissioned to design the building after finishing the Prime Minister's Office not far from the Palace of Justice.

AR Ahmad Rozi Abd Wahab, the principal Architect was personally responsible for the design layout and coming out with the architectural concept and ideas.  Architecture  Palace of Justice at night The Palace of Justice's design incorporates influences of Classical Islamic culture like Taj Mahal in India, Moorish culture, like the Sultan Abdul Samad Building in Kuala Lumpur and Western Classical influence, like Palladian. The classical design gives depths to the building skin and creates interesting articulated facade. The complex comprises a five-storey building for the judiciary and a two- storey building to house the courts and offices.  Interior  There is a large central atrium (Rotunda) around which the various rooms are arranged. The atrium helps to guide visitors who had just arrived into the building and has clear visual connection to the other floors above. The Library is located on the Ground floor adjacent to the entrance door, with the hearing rooms of both the Federal and Appeal Courts located on the first floor. The Registries and offices of the Appeal and Federal Courts are on the second and third floors respectively. The Judges chambers of the Appeal and Federal Court are located on the fourth and fifth floor. The locations of these functions are designed on designated levels to ensure privacy and security. Even the location of car parking are segregated between the judges, the staffs and the public. The arrival point for people driving their cars to the Palace of Justice are carefully scrutinised to ensure safety, security and privacy.

It was built in two levels around a knoll, the fortification resembling Armenian work, and with water supplied by aqueducts. Closer view of the ruins, west side It was then rebuilt about 1153 by the Knights Templar under the name Gaston (also Gastun, Guascon, Gastim) and held by them or by the Principality of Antioch until it was forced to capitulate to Saladin on 26 August 1189. It was retaken in 1191 by the Armenians (under Leo II), and their possession of it became a major point of contention between them and the Antiochenes and Templars. After much negotiation, it was finally returned to the Templars in 1216. According to the Armenian chronicles, it withstood a siege by the forces of Aleppo at about this time. After the fall of Antioch to Baibars in 1268, the garrison lost heart, and one of the brothers deserted and presented the keys of the castle to him. The remaining defenders decided to destroy what they could and surrender the castle. Despite the loss of the castle, Hethum II of Armenia and Leo IV of Armenia soundly defeated a Mamluk raiding force in the nearby pass in 1305.

History Between 1845 and 1856, the Assembly Rooms ‚Äì a space for public functions and a building that housed a theatre and a school ‚Äì occupied the current site of the Old Hill Street Police Station. The Old Hill Street Police Station building is the site of Singapore's first jail. Following a meeting of soldiers in the Alexandra Barracks in 1915, the Singapore Police Force was reorganised. As a result of the reorganisation, from 1915 to 1935, the Singapore Police Force built several police stations to deal with increasing Chinese secret society activities. To provide vehicular access behind the building, the steep slopes of Fort Canning had to be cut back and shored up. In 1934, the Hill Street Police Station and Barracks was opened by Director of Public Works and Adviser for Malay States, G. Sturrock, who was also a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (FRIBA). In addition to the standard facilities for a police station, there were living quarters for policemen and their families. During the Japanese Occupation, Hill Street Police Station was used by the Kempeitai as a holding area for prisoners and some say, as torture chambers. After the war, it reverted to being a police station. The Arms and Explosives Branch of the Police Department operated there from 1949 to 1981. In the 1960s, a new housing scheme gave police personnel the option to live in government-built accommodation. Police staff gradually moved out, with the last occupant leaving in 1979. Two years later, the station was closed and, after renovations, the building was renamed Hill Street Building in 1983. It housed the Official Consignee, the Official Trustees, Public Receiver and the Archives and Oral History Department (now the National Archives) and other government departments. Today, it is used by the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) and Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth. Former occupants include the National Arts Council, the National Heritage Board and the Media Development Authority. The Old Hill Street Police Station building was gazetted as a national monument on 18 December 1998. Etymology Also known as Balai Polis Hill Street Lama and (Chinese: ÊóßÁ¶ßË°óË≠¶ÂØüÂ±Ä) in Malay and Chinese respectively, the name was changed from Old Hill Street Police Station to \\"MITA Building\\" in 1999, followed by \\"MICA Building\\" in 2004. After the change of ministries in November 2012, the name \\"MICA Building\\" was reverted to \\"Old Hill Street Police Station\\". Architecture The ARTrium The Old Hill Street Police Station was built in Neo-Classical style which was still fashionable for public buildings in England in the 1930s. The building was designed by the Public Works Department when F. Dorrington Ward was the Government Architect. The six-storey building has a thoroughly Italianate air with its corbelled loggias and balconies, arcades, stuccoed, rusticated surfaces and central courtyards, one large and one small. Because of the building's height, the proportions of these internal spaces are somewhat overwhelming but, as a solution to the problems of the Singapore climate, this is a sensible idea. The building was considered amongst the finest in the world. Modern for its time, it had electric lifts by 1933. Upon its completion in 1934, it was the largest pre-war government building in Singapore and regarded as a modern skyscraper. The building has a total of 927 windows with colourful shutters. The main courtyard, the former police parade grounds, has been converted into an air-conditioned atrium, called The ARTrium for art activities. The spacious ARTrium, with its vibrant colours and ample space, regularly features artistic performances and also houses art galleries. Trivia The building has a total of 927 windows and they are painted in the colours of the rainbow. Some may notice that the coloured windows on the first four stories have the same vibrant intensity, while the upper windows gradually intensify to accentuate the cantilevered balconies which are interesting architectural features of this historical building.

To create this fabric, knit wool or wool-blend fabrics are agitated with hot water in a process called fulling. This process shrinks the fabric and results in a dense felted fabric that resists fraying and further shrinkage. Origins Boiled wool is a type of felted wool, and is similar to non-woven wool felt. These processes date at least as far back as the Middle Ages. The word felt itself comes from West Germanic feltaz. Boiled/felted wool is characteristic of the traditional textiles of South America and Tyrolean Austria. It is produced industrially around the world. Process Boiled wool fabric is created commercially by first knitting wool yarns to create a fabric of uniform thickness. The yarns and fabric may either be dyed or left natural, and the fabric may include designs or embellishments. After knitting, the fabric is fulled by boiling and agitating in hot water and an alkaline solution like soap. The agitation causes the scaly surface of wool fibers to stick together, producing a felted fabric. The result is a tighter and more dense material that is up to 50% smaller in all directions compared to the pre-felted fabric. Boiled wool is warm, durable, and resistant to water and wind. The general process of felting can be used to process non-woven fibers into pieces of felt used in industry, medical applications, and for crafts and costumes. This can be performed using a variety of fibers, including wool blends, rayon, polyester, and acrylic.

Early life He was born in Tbilisi to a Polish father, Micha≈Ç Zdaniewicz, who taught French in a gymnasium and a Georgian mother, Valentina Gamkrelidze, who was a pianist and student of Tchaikovsky. (His older brother Kiril also became a well-known artist.) He studied in the Faculty of Law of Saint Petersburg State University. In 1912 he and his brother, along with their friend Mikhail Le-Dantyu, became enthusiastic about the Tbilisi painter Niko Pirosmanashvili; Ilya's article about him, \\"Khudozhnik-samorodok\\" (\\"A natural-born artist\\"), his first publication, appeared in the February 13, 1913, issue of Zakavkazskaia Rech'. Later in 1913 he published a monograph Natalia Goncharova, Mikhail Larionov under the pseudonym Eli Eganbyuri (). In June 1914 the journal Vostok published his article \\"Niko Pirosmanashvili,\\" in which he mythologized the biography of the older artist, linking him with the Silver Age and the Russian avant-garde.N.N. Skatov, Russkaya literatura XX veka: prozaiki, poƒóty, dramaturgi, Vol. 2 (Olma Media Group, 2005: ), p. 99. He became involved with the new Futurist movement, participating in their discussions and writing about them and Marinetti in the Russian press, and was drawn to other avant-garde movements as well, such as Zaum and dadaism. During World War I Zdanevich returned to the Caucasus as a newspaper correspondent,Sergei Biryukov, review of Zdanevich collection , Toronto Slavic Quarterly (in Russian). and from 1917 to 1919 he lived in Tbilisi, where he published several collections of poetry in the zaum style (Yanko Krul Albansky, Ostraf Paskhi, and Zga Yakaby). In 1918, he joined Aleksei Kruchenykh and others in the Futurist group \\"41¬∞.\\" Zdanevich in 1919 adopted the pseudonym Iliazd. He left Tiflis for Batumi. Paris In October 1920 left the country to investigate the new artistic currents of France. After a year spent in Constantinople acquiring a French visa, he arrived in Paris in October 1921, where together with other artists he organized the group Cherez (\\"Across\\"), whose aim was to bring Russian √©migr√©s together with representatives of French culture. In 1923 he began his novel Parizhachi, about four couples who agree to dine together in the Bois de Boulogne; in the course of two and a half hours (each chapter has an exact time for a title, from 11.51 to 14.09) they all manage to betray each other, and the novel itself breaks all manner of orthographic, punctuational, and compositional rules.Natalia Arlauskaite, \\"–ù–µ–∫–æ–Ω–≤–µ–Ω—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ —ç–ª–µ–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ã —Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç–∞ –≤ —Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ç—É—Ä–µ –ø–æ–≤–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –ò–ª—å—è–∑–¥, \\"–ü–∞—Ä–∏–∂–∞—á—å–∏\\".\\" Zdanevich continued working on this \\"hyperformalist\\" novel (which he described as an opis', or \\"inventory\\"Sergei Kudryavtsev, \\"–ü–ê–†–ò–ñ–ê–ß–¨–ò,\\" Novaya Literaturnaya Gazeta 4 (1994).) until 1926, but it was not published until 1994. His second novel, Voskhishchenie (\\"Rapture\\"), was published in a small edition in 1930 and was ignored at the time. Set in a mythical Georgia among mountaineers, on the surface a crime novel, it is actually a fictionalized history of the Russian avant-garde, full of allusions to world literature; it could be said to anticipate magic realism. The language of the novel is innovative and poetic, and the Slavist Milivoje Jovanoviƒá called it \\"undoubtedly the summit toward which the Russian avant-garde was striving.\\"Sergei Biryukov, review of Zdanevich collection , Toronto Slavic Quarterly (in Russian). Zdanevich's 1923 poster for his and Tristan Tzara's Soir√©e du coeur √† barbe [Evening of the bearded heart] is a widely known example of avant-garde typography and graphic design. During the last forty years of his life in Paris, Zdanevich was active in a variety of areas. He did analyses of church elevations, created fabrics for Chanel, and above all consecrated himself to the creation of artist's books with the collaboration of Picasso, Max Ernst, Miro, and others, and which he published under the imprint \\"Le Degr√© 41\\", or \\"Le Degr√© Quarante et Un\\" (English, \\"41 degrees\\").Rapture: A Novel, readrussia.org.

Its purpose was to monitor peace agreements during and after the Tajikistan Civil War. The observers were first deployed in the wake of the ceasefire, in 1994, between the ruling government of Tajikistan, led by Emomali Rahmonov, and the United Tajik Opposition. After the UN-sponsored armistice ended the war in 1997, the UN expanded the mission's original mandate to monitor the peace and demobilization. The mission was headquartered in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. Development of United Nations involvement Tajikistan was in a state of political turmoil for months after the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic declared independence from the Soviet Union in September 1991. The United Tajik Opposition, an alliance of democratic, liberal and Islamic forces were able to take power in mid-1992 for a short time, after which Emomali Sharipani Ramona's government forces were able to regain control militarily. According to the United Nations, \\"by mid-1993, in a country of under 6 million, an estimated 50,000 people, mostly civilians, had been killed, some 600,000 had been displaced internally, and an additional 60,000 had crossed the border into northern Afghanistan.\\" Although most organized hostilities had ended by the end of 1993, UTO insurgents continued to fight Tajik government forces and their Russian Federation allies along the Tajik-Afghan border. The first peacekeeping forces, the Commonwealth of Independent States Collective Peacekeeping Forces in Tajikistan, were organized in late 1993, with forces contributed by Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. There were a number of regional attempts at peace in 1992 and 1993, none of which were particularly successful. After a direct appeal by Uzbekistan president Islam Karimov, United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali sent missions to the area for fact-finding and observation of the humanitarian situation. Subsequently, Boutros-Ghali authorized a Special Envoy for Tajikistan to seek an immediate ceasefire and negotiations between the two sides and neighboring nations. In September 1994, after talks in Moscow and Tehran, the Tehran Agreement (or the Agreement on a Temporary Ceasefire and the Cessation of Other Hostile Acts on the Tajik-Afghan Border and within the Country for the Duration of the Talks) was signed, with the stipulation that the ceasefire would be enacted as soon as UN peacekeeping observers were deployed. It went into effect 20 October 1994, after the first 15 observers arrived. The United Nations Security Council then began considering deployment of a peacekeeping mission to the area to investigate and report of ceasefire violations. Resolution 968 (1994) of 16 December 1994 formally established the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan. With the cooperation of Russian border forces and the CIS Collective Peacekeeping Forces, the mission maintained a low personnel level, with an initial strength of 55, including 22 military personnel.UNMOT official website Personnel UNMOT personnel consisted of military observers and both international and local civilian staff, as well as two civilian police officers after July 1998. The military observers came from 15 foreign countries, Austria, Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ghana, Hungary, Indonesia, Jordan, Nepal, Nigeria, Poland, Switzerland, Ukraine, and Uruguay. Though it began with an initial deployment of only 40 military observers (excluding civilian staff and police), the number was increased to its highest strength of 81 after the armistice, and reached its lowest strength of 17 at the time of UNMOT's withdrawal. Fatalities The mission suffered 7 fatalities, 3 military and 4 civilian. The most noted incident was on July 20, 1998, when four UNMOT members, Major Ryszard Szewczyk from Poland; Major Adolfo Scharpegge from Uruguay; Yutaka Akino from Japan; and Jourajon Mahramov from Tajikistan, were murdered near the city of Garm in central Tajikistan. The same day the entire UN system, as well as many international NGO's suspended operations and withdrew personnel from Tajikistan.\\"The Cold-Blooded Murder of Unarmed Peace-Keepers\\". _UNMOT Newsletter_. 22 July-3 August 1998. <> Bibliography *UNMOT official website **UNMOT statistics *UNMOT Newsletter - \\"The Cold-Blooded Murder of Unarmed Peace-Keepers\\" 22 July-3 August 1998 References Category:1990s in Tajikistan Tajikistan 968 Category:1994 establishments in Tajikistan Category:2000 disestablishments in Tajikistan Tajikistan Category:Tajikistan and the United Nations ","title":"United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan"},{"id":"3770363","text":"A nuclear pumped laser is a laser pumped with the energy of fission fragments. The lasing medium is enclosed in a tube lined with uranium-235 and subjected to high neutron flux in a nuclear reactor core. The fission fragments of the uranium create excited plasma with inverse population of energy levels, which then lases. Other methods, e.g. the He-Ar laser, can use the He(n,p)H reaction, the transmutation of helium-3 in a neutron flux, as the energy source, or employing the energy of the alpha particles. This technology may achieve high excitation rates with small laser volumes. Some example lasing media: * carbon dioxide * 3helium-argon * 3helium-krypton * 3helium-xenon Development Research in nuclear pumped lasers started in the early 1970s when researchers were unable to produce a laser with a wavelength shorter than 110 nm with the end goal of creating an x-ray laser. When laser wavelengths become that short the laser requires a huge amount of energy which must also be delivered in an extremely short period of time. In 1975 it was estimated, by George Chapline and Lowell Wood from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, that ‚Äúpumping a 10-keV (0.12-nm) laser would require around a watt per atom‚Äù in a pulse that was ‚Äú10‚àí15 seconds x the square of the wavelength in angstroms.‚Äù As this problem was unsolvable with the materials at hand and a laser oscillator was not working, research moved to creating pumps that used excited plasma. Early attempts used high-powered lasers to excite the plasma to create an even more highly powered laser. Results using this method were unsatisfying, and fell short of the goal. Livermore scientists first suggested using a nuclear reaction as a power source in 1975. By 1980 Livermore considered both nuclear bombs and nuclear reactors as viable energy sources for an x-ray laser. On November 14, 1980, the first successful test of the bomb-powered x-ray laser was conducted. The use of a bomb was initially supported over that of the reactor driven laser because it delivered a more intense beam. Livermore‚Äôs research was almost entirely devoted to missile defense using x-ray lasers. The idea was to mount a system of nuclear bombs in space where these bombs would each power approximately 50 lasers. Upon detonation these lasers would fire and theoretically destroy several dozen incoming nuclear missiles at once. Opponents of this plan found many faults in such an approach and questioned aspects such as the power, range, accuracy, politics, and cost of such deployments. In 1985 a test titled ‚ÄòGoldstone‚Äô revealed the delivered power to be less than believed. Efforts to focus the laser also failed. Fusion lasers (reactor driven lasers) started testing after the bomb-driven lasers proved successful. While prohibitively expensive (estimated at 30,000 dollars per test), research was easier in that tests could be performed several times a day and the equipment could be reused. In 1984, a test achieved wavelengths of less than 21 nm the closest to an official x-ray laser yet. (There are many definitions for an x-ray laser, some of which require a wavelength of less than 10 nm). The Livermore method was to remove the outer electrons in heavy atoms to create a ‚Äúneon-like‚Äù substance. When presented at an American Physical Society meeting, the success of the test was shared by an experiment from Princeton University which was better in size, cost, measured wavelength, and amplification than Livermore‚Äôs test. Research has continued in the field of nuclear pumped lasers and it remains on the cutting edge of the field.Hecht, Jeff. ‚ÄúThe History of the X-ray Laser‚Äù. Optics and Photonics News. Optical Society of America, 2013. http://www.osa- opn.org/home/articles/volume_19/issue_5/features/the_history_of_the_x- ray_laser/#.UX3l-spUK0hRearden, Steven L. .Congress and SDO. May 21, 1997. http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a338619.pdf Uses At least three uses for bomb pumped lasers have been proposed. Propulsion Laser propulsion is an alternative method of propulsion ideal for launching objects into orbit, as this method requires less fuel, meaning less mass must be launched. A nuclear pumped laser is ideal for this operation. A launch using laser propulsion requires high intensity, short pulses, good quality, and a high power output. A nuclear pumped laser would theoretically be capable of meeting these requirements.Boody, Frederick P. \\"200-MW 2.026-pm He/Ar/Xe Pump Laser for Space Propulsion\\". Ion Light Technologies. http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber;=1312158 Manufacturing The characteristics of the nuclear pumped laser make it ideal for applications in deep-cut welding, cutting thick materials, the heat treating of metals, vapor deposition of ceramics, and the production of sub- micron sized particles.

Livermore Laboratories conceived of the initial idea and Edward Teller developed and presented the idea to the president. Permission was granted to pursue the project though it has been reported Reagan was reluctant to incorporate nuclear devices in the nation‚Äôs plan against nuclear devices. While initial tests were promising, the results never reached acceptable levels. Later, lead scientists were accused of falsifying the reports. Project Excalibur was cancelled several years later.Thomsen, Dietrich E. (14 December 1985). \\"Strategic defense of X-ray initiative\\". The Free Library. (1985).

Biography Yelizaveta Tarakhovskaya (born Parnokh) was born in the city of Taganrog on July 26, 1891 in a pharmacist's family. She is sister to poet Sophia Parnok and twin sister to founder of Soviet Russian jazz Valentin Parnakh. She graduated from the Taganrog Girls Gymnasium, later studied in Bestuzhev courses in Saint Petersburg and started to write poems in her childhood. Birthhouse of Parnokhs in Taganrog. In 1925, her first books were published: On How Chocolate Came to MosSelProm and Tit Will Fly. Since then, she wrote many children's books, including Metropolitan (1932), The Moon and the Lazy Fellow (1933), The Seagull (1965, dedicated to Valentina Tereshkova, Soviet Russian cosmonaut, the first woman to go into space). She is the author of poems for grown-ups: The Violin Clef (1958), The Bird (1965). The verses of Tarakhovskaya are lyrical, thoughtful, and almost always full of humor, with most of them being the poetry of ordinary and everyday things around. Yelizaveta Tarakhovskaya translated into Russian many poems for children written by various Soviet and foreign authors: verses of Polish poet Julian Tuwim, Uzbek poet Kuddus Muhammadi (Muhammadiev), Azerbaijani poet Mirvari Dilbazi, Georgian poet Mariki Baratashvili(·Éõ·Éê·É†·Éò·Éô·Éê ·Éë·Éê·É†·Éê·Éó·Éê·É®·Éï·Éò·Éö·Éò), Lithuanian poet Eduardas Mie≈æelaitis, Bulgarian poet Assen Bossev and many more. Today Tarakhovskaya is probably most known for her play By the Pike's Wish, which was staged by Sergey Obraztsov in the Moscow State Academic Puppet Show named after Serguei Obraztsov in November 1936 and has remained in the theater's repertoire ever since.

Life and career Born in London, Charles Mills was educated at Dulwich College in London. After leaving school he briefly studied art before deciding to become a professional cricketer.W. A. Bettesworth, \\"Chats on the Cricket Field: C. Mills\\", Cricket, 1 June 1905, pp. 161-62. A medium-pace bowler and a steady batsman, he played for Surrey from 1885 to 1896, mostly for the club's secondary teams, but including two first-class matches in 1888. With his Surrey colleague Bill Brockwell he went to South Africa for the 1889‚Äì90 season in the hope of finding a coaching position, which they both did in Kimberley. In Mills's first match for the Kimberley Club he scored 297, which was at the time a record score in South Africa. He played a first-class match for Kimberley later that season, when Brockwell took 10 wickets in an innings victory over Natal. In 1890-91 Mills took up a coaching position in Cape Town, where he stayed for four years, playing in the Western Province team that won the Currie Cup in 1893‚Äì94. In March 1892 he played for South Africa in the Test against England, scoring 4 and 21 in a match in which the highest score by a South African batsman was 24. He toured England with the South African team in 1894, in which no first-class matches were played, scoring 452 runs at an average of 14.58, and taking 28 wickets at 23.71.Cricket, 23 August 1894, p. 350. He later coached in Philadelphia and Scotland and at the English public schools Haileybury, Bradfield and Mill Hill. He umpired Minor Counties matches, mostly involving Norfolk, from 1904 to 1906.

He was an attacking batsman and occasional bowler. Thomas Routledge was born and died in England, but he played first-class cricket for Transvaal during the last decade of the 19th Century and appeared in four Test matches for South Africa against England, all of them in South Africa. He was an aggressive batsman but often failed to convert a good start into a significant one, only twice reaching 50 in his 24 first-class innings. His first Test match was the sole representative match of England‚Äôs visit in 1891-92, played at Cape Town. He also played in the three- match series of 1895-96 but in all his four Tests he could only manage a top score of 24 as England won each match convincingly. Routledge‚Äôs highest first- class score was 77, scored in the 1893-94 Currie Cup match against Eastern Province at Cape Town. On the day the meeting was held to select South Africa's inaugural side to tour England in 1894, Routledge made a century in a non-first-class match and secured his place as a result of it. None of the 24 matches on the tour have first-class status even though many of them were against first-class county clubs. He was the touring team's second-highest scorer, with 758 runs at an average of 20.21 and a highest score of 152.

It consists of a cylindrical polyurethane balloon that sits in the aorta, approximately from the left subclavian artery. The balloon inflates and deflates via counter pulsation, meaning it actively deflates in systole and inflates in diastole. Systolic deflation decreases afterload through a vacuum effect and indirectly increases forward flow from the heart. Diastolic inflation increases blood flow to the coronary arteries via retrograde flow. These actions combine to decrease myocardial oxygen demand and increase myocardial oxygen supply.Intensive Care Medicine by Irwin and RippeIntra-aortic balloon pumping Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care of The Chinese University of Hong Kong A computer-controlled mechanism inflates the balloon with helium from a cylinder during diastole, usually linked to either an electrocardiogram (ECG) or a pressure transducer at the distal tip of the catheter; some IABPs, such as the Datascope System 98XT, allow asynchronous counterpulsation at a set rate, though this setting is rarely used. Helium is used because its low viscosity allows it to travel quickly through the long connecting tubes, but has a higher risk than air of causing an embolism should the balloon rupture. Indications The following situations may benefit from this device. *Cardiogenic shock when used alone as treatment for myocardial infarction. 9-22% survive the first year. *Reversible intracardial mechanical defects complicating infarction, i.e. acute mitral regurgitation and septal perforation. *Unstable angina pectoris benefits from counterpulsation. *Post cardiothoracic surgery--most common and useful is counterpulsation in weaning patients from cardiopulmonary bypass after continued perioperative injury to myocardial tissue. *Preoperative use is suggested for high-risk patients such as those with unstable angina with stenosis greater than 70% of main coronary artery, in ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction less than 35%. *Percutaneous coronary angioplasty *In high risk coronary artery bypass graft surgery where cardiopulmonary bypass time was shortened, as well as during intubation period and hospital stay.Usage of Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump in High Risk Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery by K. Jai Shankar *Thrombolytic therapy of acute myocardial infarction. Contraindications Aortic pressure curve in the presence of an intra-aortic balloon pump Vital parameters recorded during a 1:2 counter-pulsation Absolute contraindication The following conditions will always exclude patients for treatment: *Severe aortic valve insufficiency *Aortic dissection *Severe aortoiliac occlusive disease and bilateral carotid stenosis Relative contraindication The following conditions make IABP therapy inadvisable except under pressing circumstances: *Prosthetic vascular grafts in the aorta *Aortic aneurysm *Aortofemoral grafts *Sepsis Complications Since the device is placed in the femoral artery and aorta it could provoke ischemia, and compartment syndrome. The leg is at highest risk of becoming ischemic if the femoral artery it is supplied by becomes obstructed. Placing the balloon too distal from the aortic arch may induce occlusion of the renal artery and subsequent kidney failure. Other possible complications are cerebral embolism during insertion, infection, dissection of the aorta or iliac artery, perforation of the artery and bleeding in the mediastinum. Mechanical failure of the balloon itself is also a risk which entails vascular surgery to remove under that circumstance. After balloon removal there is also a risk of 'embolic shower' from micro clots that have formed on the surface of the balloon, and can lead to peripheral thrombosis, myocardial ischemia, hemodynamic decompensation, and late pseudoaneurysm. History The first publication of intra-aortic balloon counter-pulsation appeared in the American Heart Journal of May 1962; 63: 669-675 by S. Moulopoulos, S. Topaz and W. Kolff. The device and the balloons were then developed for commercial use between 1967 and 1969 heart surgery by William Rassman, M.D. at Cornell Medical Center and were manufactured by Datascope Corporation in 1969. The system was subsequently used clinically by Dr. David Bregman in 1976 at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. \\"NewYork-Presbyterian Heart 'Firsts'\\", available at http://www.nyp.org/about/heart-firsts.html The first clinical implant was performed at Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, N.Y. in Oct., 1967. The patient, a 48-year-old woman, was in cardiogenic shock and unresponsive to traditional therapy. An IABP was inserted by a cut down on the left femoral artery. Pumping was performed for approximately 6 hours. Shock reversed and the patient was discharged. The size of the original balloon was 15 French but eventually 9 and 8 French balloons were developed. http://www.rjmatthewsmd.com/Definitions/IABP_Counterpulsation.htm Intra Aortic Balloon Pump (IABP) Counterpulsation by P. J Overwalder, M.D. A second operation removed the balloon. Since 1979 the placement of the balloon has been modified using the Seldinger technique.

His first-class career spanned the years 1894 to 1904 but in truth it was interrupted by a break of six years between 1897 and 1903. Playing for Eastern Province, he was more effective in the first half of his career, hitting up scores of, amongst others, 67 against Transvaal at Cape Town in March 1894 and 71 against Natal at Johannesburg in March 1897. He also recorded his best bowling figures during this period, 4 wickets for 9 runs against Griqualand West at Cape Town in March 1894. When Lord Hawke brought an England side to South Africa in 1895/96, Gleeson was selected for the 1st Test, played at St. George's Park, Port Elizabeth. Scoring just 3 in South Africa‚Äôs first innings and 1 not out in their second, as well as holding two catches, he failed to impress enough to secure a place for the other two matches in the series.

The oxidised paint is duller than fresh paint and the cutting compound is used to expose this fresher surface. Modern automotive painting often includes a thin, transparent protective coating on which cutting compound should not be used.

Athenian educates students in grades 6‚Äì12 on an approximately campus at the base of Mt. Diablo, located in the San Francisco Bay area in Northern California. Athenian was founded by Dyke Brown (1915‚Äì2006) in 1965. Athenian is composed of roughly 175 students in the middle school (grades 6-8) and 355 students in the high school (9-12) which is also known as the upper school. Approximately 60 students and 18 teachers live on campus full-time. The average class size is 16. Aerial view of Athenian School According to Niche, The Athenian School is ranked 106th on the 2020 list of Best Private High Schools in America and the number one school in Contra Costa County. Athenian is also ranked as the 28th best boarding school in the United States. Athenian holds an average SAT score of 1385 (out of 1600) and an average ACT score of 31. According to Boarding School Review, this gives Athenian the 8th highest SAT score of any boarding school in the United States.  History  Dyke Brown conceived of the idea of a mission-driven boarding school during his tenure as Vice President of the Ford Foundation, influenced by his Foundation work in youth development and the prevention of juvenile delinquency, and by his own children's educational experiences.The history section is adapted from Athenian: An Oral History. Athenian is a founding member of Round Square, an international organization of schools whose philosophy is influenced The beginnings of the Round Square Conference by the German educator Kurt Hahn. In 1962, Brown left the Ford Foundation to begin to raise money for the school he had in mind. Inspired by the Oxford system of individual colleges sharing common resources, his original plan was a series of four campuses sharing a library, science classrooms, athletic facilities, a performing-arts complex, and other facilities. He found 80+ acres of land in what was then rural Contra Costa county, a portion of what was then the Blackhawk Ranch, bordering on Mount Diablo State Park. Construction began in 1963, and the founding head, W. Robert Usellis, began recruiting the pioneer classes in the fall of 1964. Brown's vision was startling at the time: he planned for both integration and coeducation. In the early 1960s, very few private schools were recruiting students of color. The value of integration for private schools was seen by a very few visionaries, including the founders of A Better Chance. Mission and History of A Better Chance The norm for boarding schools at the time was single-sex; a coeducational boarding program was unusual. In September 1965, the school opened with approximately sixty students, in ninth and tenth grades. In 1968, the founding class graduated, with a full enrollment of about 120 students, of whom only about six were day students. In the 1970s, Athenian weathered local, national, and international changes. The surrounding area was transformed from cattle ranches to upscale developments. Athenian's neighbor, Blackhawk Ranch, was sold to land developer Ken Behring, and by 1979 2,500 upscale homes were built. The population boom in the area meant that there was an increased demand for day student places at the school. Nationally, at least two forces were at work. First, the stagflation of the 1970s meant that parents had less discretionary income, thus weakening the pool of prospective boarding students. Other demographic changes, such as the increase in divorce, affected the pool of prospective boarding students. In 1979, there was sufficient interest in the surrounding community for Athenian to open a day- school-only middle school, serving students in grades 6-8. Most of them continued on to finish high school at Athenian.  Athletics  Aerial view of Athenian School pool area Athenian is one of ten schools in the Bay Counties League - East. The school colors are terra cotta and earth; the sports teams wear orange and black. Athenian's golf team has won the league title for four consecutive years, and in seven of the last eight. The women's basketball team became league champions on February 8, 2008. In 2019, Athenian's men's varsity soccer team won the league title, league tournament along with the California NCS Division II state championship for the first time in school history. The full list of sports offered includes wrestling, soccer, volleyball, flag football, ultimate frisbee, tennis, dance, golf, swimming, track & field, cross country, sailing, basketball, baseball, badminton, and a variety of other non-team athletics, including hiking, fencing, yoga, outdoor adventure, and weight training.  Athenian Wilderness Experience (AWE)  While Athenian's founder, Dyke Brown, was influenced by Kurt Hahn, a wilderness expedition was not originally required in the curriculum. In the summer of 1968, two female members of the class of 1969 participated in the only program available for girls in the Boundary Waters Park. Upon their return to school, they impressed upon Brown and other school leaders the importance of having such an experience by part of the Athenian education. Originally, Athenian students went on courses provided by the Sierra arm of Outward Bound. After several years, the school devised its own program and hired staff, and made participation in AWE a graduation requirement. Now, Athenian students in their junior year spend three and a half weeks hiking in either the Sierra Nevada (during the summer) or Death Valley (during the spring). Clubs Student activity clubs include Robotics, Asian Club, Outdoor Adventure Club, Interweave (Gay-Straight Alliance), Jew Crew, Black Student Union, Christian Club, Interfaith Dialogue Club, Philanthropy Club, Hip Hop Club, Tea Club, Entrepreneurship, Round Square Club, Minecraft Architecture Club, and more.Equity and Inclusion: Student Activities  Robotics  The Athenian Robotics Collective (ARC) competes regularly in the FIRST Robotics Competition. Over the past few years they have had much success under the tutelage of Eugene Mizusawa, Megan Leich, and Brad Niven, as well as a dedicated group of adult mentors. Athenian has performed very well in its regional competition, competing against schools with many times its own population and resources. The robotics team has placed in the regional competition three times, first qualifying for the national tournament in 2004. In 2006, the team placed first in the region and again attended the national tournament in Atlanta, Georgia. On February 28, 2007, ARC participated in outreach by demonstrating the capabilities of one of their robots (Chet V) to students at Pleasant Hill Elementary School, as part of their science night. In 2007, ARC and their robot, Chet VI, took second place at the Silicon Valley Regional and the Davis Sacramento Regional. In addition, the team won the General Motors Industrial Design Award for the second year running. In 2008, Athenian was once again the recipient of the GM Industrial Design Award at the Davis Sacramento Regional. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the FIRST Robotics competition in the area was cancelled, and thus the team did not compete in the Infinite Recharge FRC season. In 2019, The Athenian School hosted their first FIRST Lego League (FLL) tournament with the help of the ARC. The Athenian Middle school had 3 FLL teams of their own in 2019, all three of which competed in the FLL tournament.  Heads of School  *1966-1968: W.

Much of his cricket was played when he held the rank of Major, but he eventually became a Brigadier-General. \\"Of all the people in the history of the game,\\" wrote Leo Cooper in an introduction to A. A. Thomson's Odd Men In, \\"he seems to stand for the Eccentric Ideal.\\"Cooper introduction to Odd Men In, pp. v‚Äìvi. Military career Poore was the son of Major Robert Poore (1834‚Äì1918) and his wife Juliana Lowry-Corry, daughter of Rear-Admiral Armar Lowry-Corry. He joined the 7th Hussars and served in the Second Matabele War in Rhodesia 1896‚Äì1897. He was appointed Provost Marshal in South Africa during the Second Boer War 1899‚Äì1902, and received the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in 1901. In a despatch dated 31 March 1900, the Commander-in-Chief, Lord Roberts, described how Poore \\"has exercised his responsible duties, whether as regards the care of prisoners, or in maintaining order in camp and on the line of march, in a most satisfactory manner\\". Poore was Provost Marshall during the trial and execution of Breaker Morant and Peter Handcock, and his diary includes contemporary notes on their case. Cricket career In 1899, Poore became the most fertile run-scorer in all of England, hitting 1,399 runs (including seven hundreds) between 12 June and 12 August at an average of 116.58. Against Somerset he made 304 and with fellow Army officer Captain Wynyard shared in a stand of over 400 for the sixth wicket ‚Äì still the highest for that wicket in county cricket.Somerset v Hampshire 1899. Cricketarchive.com. Retrieved on 3 May 2018. In 21 innings over the course of the entire season, Poore managed 1,551 runs at 91.23, a record average for an English season not broken until Don Bradman averaged 98.66 in 1930. Poore was rewarded with selection as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year.Major Robert Poore. Espncricinfo.com. Retrieved on 3 May 2018. Poore returned to South Africa after the 1899 season to fight in the Boer War. After he returned to England, a broken arm caused him to miss most of the 1902 season, but he showed he retained his former skill with a superb innings of 62 not out against Hugh Trumble on a sticky wicket for Hampshire against the touring Australians.Hampshire v Australians 1902. Cricketarchive.com. Retrieved on 3 May 2018. It was hoped Major Poore would be available again in 1903, but he went to India that summer and when he returned to Hampshire in the middle of 1904 to great expectations, his form was disappointing. Although there were few difficult pitches in the nine games he played, he averaged under twenty and only once (on a bad wicket against Sussex) did he show the skill that allowed him to dominate bowlers in 1899. In 1905 he again could not play at all, but he rejoined the team against Derbyshire in 1906 and in two matches scored 232 runs including 129 against Sussex, but another injury ended his season and as it turned out, his county career. In spite of his impressive success, Poore was not yet overly enamoured with the game, which he had learnt not through classical coaching but the perusal of textbooks; certainly, it was not the only field in which his prodigious talents lay: he was a first-rate swordsman, shot and polo player, and once won the West of India lawn tennis championship. Not until, as a subaltern, he visited India with the 7th Hussars did he realise his love for cricket, a love that he sustained all through his life. Poore remained a dangerous batsman in club games right up to his mid- fifties, and played first-class cricket in India as late as 1913. Family In 1898 Poore married Lady Flora Mary Ida Douglas-Hamilton (1866‚Äì1957), daughter of Captain Charles-Douglas-Hamilton, and sister of the 13th Duke of Hamilton. The couple had no children. Three years after their marriage, Poore's sister Nina Mary Benita Poore (1878‚Äì1951), married her brother's brother-in-law, and became Duchess of Hamilton.

Curtained hair or curtains is a hairstyle featuring a long fringe divided in either a middle parting or a side parting, with short (or shaved) sides and back. Curtained hair generally applies to males, although an alternative name, the undercut, is used for both male and female haircuts following this style. Variations on this haircut have been popular in Europe and North America throughout the 20th century and in the 21st century. Origins Mao Zedong with the short version of curtains fashionable from 1910 to 1930 A shorter version of the haircut, parted in the middle and kept in place with pomade became popular during the Edwardian era as a more practical alternative to the longer hair and sideburns fashionable from the 1840s to 1890s. This was due in part to the popularity of sporting activities like rugby football among younger men. From the turn of the century until the 1920s, a longer variant of the undercut was popular among young working-class men, especially members of street gangs. In interwar Glasgow, Neds, the precursors to the Teddy Boys, favoured a haircut that was long on top and cropped at the back and sides. Despite the fire risk, much paraffin wax was used to keep the hair in place.Christie, Stuart (2002). My Granny Made Me an Anarchist. Oil & Gas USSR. pp. 87‚Äì88. . Other gangs who favored this haircut were the Scuttlers of Manchester, and the Peaky Blinders of Birmingham, because longer hair put the wearer at a disadvantage in a street fight.Davies, A. (1998), \\"Youth gangs, masculinity and violence in late Victorian Manchester and Salford\\", Journal of Social History 32 (2) Revival During the late 1980s centrally parted hair, derived from the bowl cut, made a comeback among fans of new wave, synthpop, and electronic music as an alternative to the mullets and backcombed hair worn by glam metal bands. In the UK, curtains were popularised during the early 1990s by the Baggy or Madchester scene as well as contemporary Shoegaze and Britpop bands such as The Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets, early Blur, The Beautiful South, and the Stone Roses. It was also popular in the UK because of David Beckham hair in the mid 90‚Äôs. A longer, collar-length version of the haircut went mainstream in the early to mid 1990s and was worn by many celebrities, most notably Tom Cruise.Tom Cruise in 1983 In popular culture Actors who have worn the longer version of curtained hair include Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible 2,Tom Cruise hair Brendan Fraser in The Mummy Returns, Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic, River Phoenix in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and Fox Mulder in earlier seasons of The X-Files.

Life  Very little is known about his life. The title of his work records him as a kouropalatƒìs and a former droungarios of the Vigla, whereby he is usually identified with a certain John Thrakesios.Kazhdan (1991), p. 1914 His major work is the Synopsis of Histories (, ), which covers the reigns of the Byzantine emperors from the death of Nikephoros I in 811 to the deposition of Michael VI in 1057; it continues the chronicle of Theophanes the Confessor. There is a continuation of this work, known as Scylitzes Continuatus covering 1057 to 1079; some historians hypothesize that it was also written by Skylitzes. The Madrid Skylitzes The most famous manuscript of the Synopsis was produced in Sicily in the 12th century known as the Madrid Skylitzes (, ), and is now at the Biblioteca Nacional de Espa√±a in Madrid.

He was also co-founder of Children's Village with 23 others. He moved to New York City in 1829 to run a Quaker bookstore. From 1841-1845 he served as treasurer and book agent for the American Anti-Slavery Society. In 1845 he became active in prison reform and devoted the rest of his life to the Prison Association of New York. Life and career Isaac Tatem Hopper was born into a Quaker family in Deptford, New Jersey in 1771. He married Sarah Tatum Hopper in 1795 and together they had ten children, including notable abolitionist Abigail Hopper Gibbons, and a notable grandson DeWolf Hopper. http://web.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/speccoll/quakersandslavery/commentary/people/hopper.php He became a Hicksite Quaker ‚Äì a follower of Elias Hicks ‚Äì although he lived in Philadelphia, while many Hicksites lived in rural areas. Following the American Revolutionary War, Pennsylvania had abolished slavery before the end of the eighteenth century. The state, and especially the major port city of Philadelphia, became a destination and byway for fugitive slaves escaping the South. In the years before the American Civil War, Philadelphia was frequented by slave kidnappers, who often would capture free black children to sell into slavery, as well as hunt fugitive slaves to return to their owners for reward. Hopper became an active and leading member of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society, whose members frequently worked to protect the rights of African Americans, as well as to seek the end of slavery in the United States. In time, Hopper became known in Philadelphia as a friend and adviser to blacks in all emergencies. Hopper was an overseer of the Negro School for Children in Philadelphia, which was founded by the early abolitionist Anthony Benezet before the Revolutionary War, and operated through the nineteenth century. Hopper also served as a volunteer teacher in a free school for African- American adults. He was one of the founders and the secretary of a society for the employment of the poor; a volunteer prison inspector; member of a fire company, and guardian of abused apprentices. Married and with a large family, he and his wife often extended their limited resources to take in more impoverished Quakers. Their children learned early to care for others. He also transacted much business for the Society of Friends. In 1829 Hopper moved his family to New York in order to run a bookstore established by the Hicksite Quakers. In the autumn of 1830, being called to Ireland on business connected with his wife's estate, he visited England. In both countries he was at first treated somewhat cavalierly by the orthodox Quakers, and was pointed out as the one \\"who has given Friends so much trouble in America.\\" His amiable personality changed their unfavorable impressions. By the spring of 1841, the demand for Hicksite books had greatly diminished. Hopper became the treasurer and book agent for the American Anti-Slavery Society in New York. The Isaac T. Hopper Home of the Women's Prison Association in the East Village of Manhattan, New York City Prison reform advocacy In 1845 he gave up his offices with the Anti-Slavery Society, and devoted the rest of his life to the Prison Association of New York, which sought reform in prisons and the justice system. His married daughter, Abigail Hopper Gibbons, by then also in New York, founded the Women's Prison Association, to work for prison reform. She also founded an asylum for women prisoners who had been released, to help with their re-entry to society, which she named for her father as the \\"Isaac T. Hopper Home.\\" Hopper frequently visited the state capital of Albany, New York, to represent the association and to address the legislature. Judge Edmonds says of one of these occasions: \\"His eloquence was simple and direct, but most effective. If he was humorous, his audience were full of laughter; if solemn, a death-like stillness reigned; if pathetic, tears flowed all around him.\\" He often pleaded for the pardon of prisoners. Governor John Young of New York, once said to him: \\"Friend Hopper, I will pardon any convict whom you say you conscientiously believe I ought to pardon.\\" NotesReferences * * Further reading * Bacon, Margaret Hope, Lamb's Warrior: The Life of Isaac T.

He scored South Africa's first three Test centuries and was the first person from any country to score a century and take five wickets in an innings in the same Test. He is one of the fastest-scoring Test batsmen of all time. Cricket career=1890s Jimmy Sinclair stood six feet four inches tallBenny Green ed. (1979) Wisden Anthology 1864‚Äì1900, Queen Anne Press, London. p. 870. . and was a \\"prodigious right-handed hitter and an excellent fast bowler, combining a nice variety of pace with a high delivery\\".Christopher Martin-Jenkins, The Complete Who's Who of Test Cricketers, Rigby, Adelaide, 1983, p. 313. He made his first-class debut for Transvaal in the 1892‚Äì93 Currie Cup a few weeks after turning 16, opening both bowling and batting, taking eight wickets and scoring 37 and 11. He took 10 wickets and top-scored with 75 for a Johannesburg XV against Lord Hawke's XI in 1895‚Äì96 and was selected for all three Tests that followed. At this stage in its history South Africa had played three Tests, all against England, and been so outclassed that no batsman had scored more than 29. That dismal record was not disturbed in the First Test in 1895‚Äì96, but in the Second Test Sinclair set a new record, scoring 40 in the first innings. He finished the series South Africa's second-highest scorer with 103 runs at an average of 17.16 and, opening the bowling, South Africa's second-highest wicket-taker with eight wickets at an average of 30.37. South Africa lost all three Tests by large margins. In February 1897 Sinclair scored 301 not out in a club game, which remained the highest score in any form of cricket in South Africa for many years.Ali Bacher & David Williams, Jacques Kallis and 12 Other Great South African All-Rounders, Penguin, Johannesburg, 2013, p. 4. South Africa's next Tests came in 1898‚Äì99, with a two-match series against England. This time, thanks largely to Sinclair, the matches were more evenly contested, and South Africa gained a first-innings lead each time before losing. He did not bowl in the First Test, but scored 86, South Africa's first Test fifty, opening the first innings; apart from Pelham Warner's 132 in England's second innings, no one else in the match reached 40. In the Second Test Sinclair became the first person from any country to score a century and take five wickets in an innings in the same Test.Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 2016, pp. 1309‚Äì10. In England's first innings he took 6 for 30, dismissing them for 92, then went in to bat with South Africa's score at 27 for 2 to make 106 before being last out with the total on 177. He was caught on the boundary in each innings. 1900s Sinclair fought on the British side in the Boer War. He was captured by the Boers but escaped in time to take part in South Africa's tour of England in 1901.Bacher & Williams, p. 6. No Tests were played on the 1901 tour. Sinclair's batting was only moderately successful, but in the first-class matches against the counties he twice took 13 wickets in a match, and as an indication of the esteem in which he was held in England he was invited to play a few games for London County and to represent the Gentlemen against the Players. For London County he took 8 for 32 against Derbyshire and scored 108 not out in 80 minutes against Warwickshire. South Africa next played Test cricket when Australia brought a strong team for three Tests in 1902‚Äì03. The First Test was drawn, Sinclair making 44 and 19 and taking five wickets. It was the first Test South Africa had not lost. In the Second Test, a week later on the same ground, South Africa lost, but Sinclair top-scored in each innings: 101 in two hours out of a team total of 240 in the first innings, and 18 in the second out of 85.Bacher & Williams, p. 7. Sinclair made a duck in the first innings of the Third Test, but in the second innings he made one of the fastest Test centuries of all time: 104, including six sixes, in 80 minutes, off approximately 79 balls. Wisden described it as \\"a superb innings, and he might perhaps have made more runs if he had not become somewhat reckless after completing his hundred\\". He had gone to the wicket at 81 for 2, and the score was 216 for 6 when he was dismissed. South Africa lost again. In South Africa's next Test series, against the English tourists in 1905‚Äì06, Sinclair made 160 runs at an average of 20.00 and took 21 wickets at 19.90 in South Africa's first series victory. By this stage other South Africans were also contributing substantially, such as the all-rounder Aubrey Faulkner and his fellow leg-spinners Reggie Schwarz, Bert Vogler and Gordon White, and the 4‚Äì1 series victory was a team effort. Sinclair continued to play Test cricket until 1911, but with only moderate success.Bacher & Williams, pp. 8‚Äì11. A 2006 source shows Sinclair as still being the world's sixth quickest batsman. He scored his runs at around 71 or 72 per 100 balls.Bacher & Williams, p. 11. Various stories are told about him, including that on one occasion a ball he had hit for a six at the Old Wanderers Ground in Johannesburg landed on a train bound for the Cape and was only recovered at its destination. This ball was for many years on display at the Wanderers' clubhouse (both old and new grounds) until a fire in the latter part of the 20th century. Other sports Sinclair also played international rugby union and won a single international appearance in association football, thus representing his country at three sports. He shares this distinction with his contemporary Percy Sherwell (cricket, association football and tennis).

Some of the more famous performers include Kevin Parker, Troye Sivan, Rolf Harris, David Helfgott, Luke Steele and Tim Minchin. Notable artists in genres including rock, classical, and electronic music have lived in Perth. History Perth's isolation is problematic for many rising artists, as it increases costs associated with touring and promotion. For this reason, many artists leave Perth to improve their popularity, with varying degrees of success. While most artists leave after achieving some popularity, some acclaimed performers only gained their fame after leaving, such as The Triffids and Pendulum. Current The Perth International Arts Festival bills itself as the largest and longest-lasting multi-arts festival in Australia.Perth International Arts Festival Music institutions include the West Australian Opera, West Australian Symphony Orchestra, and numerous choral groups. Popular music Perth is also home to a major local scene, which has produced nationally and internationally renowned artists such as Tame Impala, Troye Sivan, The Stems, Pond, Eskimo Joe, John Butler Trio, Gyroscope, Birds of Tokyo, End of Fashion, Methyl Ethel, Turnstyle, Little Birdy, Jebediah, The Sleepy Jackson, Karnivool, Institut Polaire, The Panics, The Waifs, Knife Party and drum and bass acts like Pendulum. Perth's hip hop scene has produced artists such as Drapht, Downsyde, MC Layla, Matty B, and Lo-Key Fu. Many of these artists are members of the Perth hip hop crew named Syllabolix. A majority of Perth's premier emcees are featured on the Obese Records label. This connection has seen several Perth artists feature in the recordings of other Australian acts, such as The Hilltop Hoods. Many of Australia's critically acclaimed hardcore bands and punk bands originated from Perth, including Extortion, Miles Away, Break Even, The Decline, Rupture and Heist. Classical Perth is home to the West Australian Symphony Orchestra which performs a regular programme of orchestral music, usually from its base at the Perth Concert Hall; it also tours regional Western Australia. There are a large number of smaller professional, semi-professional and non-professional music groups and choral societies and choirs which perform in a variety of venues in and around Perth. Repertoire ranges from baroque to contemporary. The West Australian Youth Music Association (or WAYMA), allows the youth of Perth to experience playing in a musical ensemble. Acceptance is only granted to amateur student players under the age of 25 years and who are currently under instrumental tutelage. The association runs a symphonic band, a flute choir, several choirs and four orchestras in total (two string orchestras and two symphony orchestras). Venues Major music venues in Perth include the Perth Concert Hall, Perth Arena, Challenge Stadium, the Metropolis Concert Clubs in Fremantle and Perth, Fremantle Arts Centre, Belvoir Amphitheatre and the Red Hill Auditorium. Large international acts often play outdoors, in stadium venues like the WACA cricket ground, Subiaco Oval, Members Equity Stadium or Perth Oval. Festival events are generally held at Claremont Showground or on the Perth Esplanade. The Supreme Court Gardens offer a large alternative outdoor venue, and have hosted such acts as David Bowie. Many former venues have been demolished, including wartime dancehalls such as The Tearooms and The Pagoda Ballroom. The Perth Entertainment Centre hosted many international acts until it was closed in 2002 and demolished in 2012. It has been replaced with the Perth Arena. Similarly the Burswood Dome hosted many international acts until its demolition in 2013. Other venues, such as The Bakery, The Raffles Hotel, the Hyde Park Hotel, The Grosvenor, The Stoned Crow, Fitzgerald's, The Red Parrot and The Old Melbourne Hotel, have closed as music venues but have been redeveloped as restaurants, public bars or apartments. Current live music venues are predominantly located in the Fremantle and Perth/Northbridge entertainment districts. Many mid-sized venues host international and interstate acts. Some of these include the Fly-By-Night, The Newport Hotel, Mojos, the Rosemount Hotel and Amplifier/Capitol. Many other smaller clubs and pubs present live music pop music predominantly, plus hip-hop, electronic music, cover bands and lesser-known local artists. Publications Local street press publications dedicated to the music and arts scene include X-Press Magazine and The Music (formerly known as Drum Media).Drum Media Many newspapers and magazines include sections on the Perth music scene, including the Wire Magazine, The West Australian's latest attempt at appealing to the youth market, and university publications such as Grok Magazine, Pelican and Metior. Now defunct, there were many other music publications such as: Party Fears and Vortex, which often included a free seven-inch vinyl flexidisc stapled to the front, featuring local bands. Radio Perth is serviced by commercial radio stations Hit92.9, Nova 937, Mix 94.5, 96FM and 6iX, as well as public stations triple j and ABC Classic FM.

In May 2014, Reliance Industries announced it would be taking over Network18. The move was touted as \\"the biggest-ever deal in the Indian media space\\". Reliance Industries already had indirect control of the TV18 network by virtue of investments it made in Network18 starting from January 2012. History CNN International only reached urban elites in India. To reach the Indian masses Time Warner together with an Indian company, Global Broadcast News (currently TV18 Broadcast Limited), launched the channel in India as CNN- IBN on 18 December 2005. The channel was completely run by TV18 Broadcast Limited, which only used the Cable News Network (CNN) brand name. Currently, Time Warner's India-specific CNN-News18 is watched by more people than its CNN International sister network, although both channels are in English. According to Network 18, since its inception, the channel has been reaching out to an average of 45 million households every day. In 2015, it was announced that a licensing agreement between Turner Broadcasting and Network 18 had not been renewed and would expire in January 2016.

In section 14.4.2 of the report, CAG alleged that while awarding contracts worth Rs 37.8 million for production & broadcasting of commercials for promoting CWG-2010 to CNN-IBN & NDTV, the Commonwealth Games Organising Committee followed an arbitrary approach. Proposals were considered in an ad hoc manner, as and when a proposal was received; no form of competitive tendering was adopted. The CAG further said in its report that, \\"We had no assurance about the competitiveness of the rates quoted by these channels and the need and usefulness of these proposals. From March 2010 to June 2010, the entire pre-games publicity and sponsorship publicity was done only on NDTV & CNN-IBN.\\" Fake Twitter comments A controversy about some fake Twitter comments that ran on the screen during a news show raised questions about the reliability of instant feedback from viewers, which was criticised. The officials later apologised saying that the source of viewer comment was wrongly stated as Twitter. Fake live debate In November 2012, on its prime time show Face The Nation, the channel broadcast a pre-recorded and edited interview of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar as a live television debate.

Born out of wedlock in Pietermaritzburg to a Welsh father and a black Saint Helenan mother, the dark- eyed and dark-skinned Llewellyn had an underprivileged upbringing in Natal, being considered of mixed blood. He showed all round cricketing prowess from a young age as a hard hitting left-handed batsman, slow left-arm bowler (with a dangerous Slow left-arm wrist-spin delivery as part of his arsenal) and a great fielder, particularly at mid-off. While the racism of late nineteenth- century South Africa had led to other leading non-white players being omitted from representative sides, Llewellyn's ability to pass himself off as white in some cases (Wilfred Rhodes described him as \\"like a rather sunburned English player\\"), helped clear the racial hurdle to selection and he was chosen to make his first-class debut for Natal against Transvaal on 13 April 1895, where he took four wickets. While now accepted as a cricketer, Llewellyn would be referred to as \\"coloured\\" throughout his career and there are reports of his race-related mistreatment by other South African players. Duly impressed with his cricketing skill, selectors chose him in a Natal side against Lord Hawke's England XI and subsequently selected Llewellyn to make his Test debut for South Africa against England at Johannesburg on 2 March 1896, aged 19 years and 155 days. Llewellyn failed to take a wicket in this first Test and was promptly omitted from the remainder of the series but responded by performing impressively in the 1897‚Äì98 and 1898‚Äì99 Currie Cups, which led to his recall to the national team for the first Test of the 1898‚Äì99 series against England. Llewellyn impressed by taking five wickets but was surprisingly left out of the second Test. At the end of the 1898‚Äì99 series Llewellyn, perturbed by the actions of the selectors and seeking financial security, left South Africa to play for English county side Hampshire County Cricket Club as a professional, on the recommendation of South African teammate Major Robert Poore, an ex- Hampshire cricketer on military assignment. He would star for Hampshire for over a decade, scoring 8772 runs at 27.58 and snaring 711 wickets at 24.66. His form was such that in 1902 Llewellyn was named in the English First Test squad against the touring Australians, missing out on the final side. He was however included in a strong English side captained by Ranjitsinhji to tour America that included Jessop, Sammy Woods, Archie MacLaren, Stoddart, Bosanquet and Townsend. In 1902‚Äì03 Llewellyn returned to South Africa to play in the three Test series against Australia. He scored 90 in the First Test, his highest Test score, as well as taking nine wickets for the match. Llewellyn took ten wickets in the second Test and six in the third to top the series bowling average at 17.92; a remarkable achievement considering Australia won the series 2‚Äì0. Llewellyn continued to shine for Hampshire, capped by his selection as one of Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Year in 1910, his last year at Hampshire. He then toured Australia with the South African team, where his bowling served as fodder for Victor Trumper, before returning to England in 1911 to join club side Accrington, thereby becoming the first Test cricketer to play in the Lancashire League. In 1912, South Africa brought him out of first-class retirement to play in the Triangular Tournament, scoring 75 in the first Test against England at Lord's and a further half-century against Australia at Lord's. Llewellyn retired from Test cricket after the triangular tournament, having played 15 Tests (five against England and ten against Australia), scored 544 runs at 20.14 and 48 wickets at 29.60. He however continued to star in league cricket, finally retiring in 1938 at the age of 62. Llewellyn broke his thigh in 1960, affecting his movement for the remainder of his life and died in Chertsey, Surrey in 1964, aged 87. Even after his death, Llewellyn remained a controversial figure, as Llewellyn's daughter, resident in England, in 1976 publicly contested claims that he was not white, stating that his mother had been an English-born white woman. Llewellyn's legacy as the first non-white South African Test cricketer remains large. During the apartheid period he was used to show that non-white cricketers could perform as well as their white counterparts, while modern day commentators have pointed to the erratic selection of Llewellyn for South Africa throughout his career as the result of prejudice due to his skin colour. While Llewellyn was the first non-white South African Test cricketer, it was not until Omar Henry took the field against India in November 1992 that South Africa had its second.

One of the earliest successful South African bowlers, George Rowe was born in Grahamstown, South Africa on 15 June 1874. Playing for Western Province during the early years of the Currie Cup, he made his first class debut against Natal in 1893/94 in the final of the competition, and played his last match for the province in 1907. He was a slow left-arm orthodox bowler and claimed five wickets in an innings on thirteen occasions, converting five of them into ten-wicket match hauls.

Initially presented as a \\"spoiled teen vixen\\", the role was gradually expanded by producers. Subsequently, Kelly became instrumental in launching the first spin-off, was written with a more compassionate demeanor, overcame several perils and personal challenges, and attracted many romantic suitors and triangles. Appearing for the entirety of the series' run, the character is noted for her development from youth to adulthood. Kelly appears prominently in a majority of the shows that compose the Beverly Hills, 90210 franchise. In addition to her role in launching the spin-off Melrose Place, Garth was the first performer from the original show to be cast in the third spin-off, 90210. Having appeared in the most series premieres, as well as the most episodes of any figure throughout the continuity, she is the de facto central character of the Beverly Hills, 90210 franchise. Garth's portrayal has earned recognition from critics and co-stars. In a 1995 article on the actress, TV Guide's Mary Murphy stated that, \\"Her signature role‚Äîthe sensitive, seductive, and tortured Kelly Taylor‚Äîtapped into the very essence of teenage angst and brought her a huge cult following.\\" Actors Jason Priestley, Grant Show, and Sara Foster have expressed admiration for Garth's work. In a 2009 article, Nellie Andreeva of The Hollywood Reporter called the character of Kelly \\"organic to 90210's setting.\\" Beverly Hills, 90210=Introduction Throughout the course of the first series, Kelly became one of the show's most developed characters. When introduced in 1990, she was presented as, on the surface, a stereotypical spoiled type who placed high value on a posh appearance and material possessions. However, the character would become increasingly layered as the series progressed. The reasons for Kelly's behavior first started to reveal themselves in episode 7, \\"Perfect Mom\\", when Kelly was forced to confront her mother's drug addiction and alcoholism. Several of her friends, particularly the Walsh family and Andrea Zuckerman, first came to appreciate Kelly's difficulties in life when they saw her handle this problem. During episode 13, \\"Slumber Party,\\" Kelly revealed that she was taken advantage of by a senior during her freshmen year in high school, which had led to a promiscuous lifestyle and reputation which deeply hurt her self- esteem. The others then began to realize that Kelly had been through more difficulties than they were aware of, and later, she and Andrea would become close friends. When Andrea was pregnant and was contemplating an abortion in season 4, Kelly was one of the primary people she reached out to. Progression Toward the end of the second season, Kelly met a man named Jake Hanson (played by Grant Show), an emotionally guarded biker who was slightly older than she. While Jake ultimately resisted their romance, citing Kelly's age, he admitted to admiring her for her heart and kindness. This story line was used to launch the spin-off series Melrose Place. Eventually, Kelly was revealed to have a notable conscience during a summer fling with Dylan McKay, the boyfriend of her friend Brenda, often being the voice of reason during their affair. Kelly went through a period of minor depression during her senior year in high school in season 3. The stress of having feelings for Dylan, someone who she could not pursue because of his relationship with Brenda, added to her struggles. Even when Kelly dated Dylan out in the open, following his relationship with Brenda, it caused her to temporarily lose Brenda as a friend. Also during this time, Kelly's mother had a new baby, Erin, got married, and put Kelly's childhood home up for sale. Self-consciousness over her figure, along with the anxiety she began to feel, caused her to lash out emotionally, abuse diet pills, and briefly lose control over her life. The character's physical appearance is shown to play a part in her development. At various points of the series, she won the title of Spring Princess at a dance, and was voted her school's most beautiful girl. Kelly is aware of her appeal, but not to the point of conceit; instead, she is sometimes shown to be troubled by it. At one point, she entered a phase where she felt that no one took her seriously, which was heightened when Dylan gave his manuscript to Andrea for review instead of to her. During this time, she began to feel that people only liked her because she was physically attractive. Creator Darren Star has commented on the character's progression. In his DVD commentary of the episode \\"Spring Dance\\", Star notes Kelly's first attempt to romance Brandon Walsh, in which she'd embraced her role as Spring Princess and used a largely forward and aggressive approach. He goes on to state that in the fourth season, when Kelly was prone to expressing her affections in a more gentle and compassionate manner, she made a greater impression on Brandon. While pursuing Jake on Melrose Place, a confused Kelly eventually asks, \\"Don't you think I'm pretty?\\" This contrasts with her attitude one year later, when she becomes more interested in having others appreciate her for what lies beneath the surface. This development is standardized one additional year later, via her aforementioned second pursuit of Brandon Walsh, which ends in success. Rise in prominence The evolution of Kelly's character led to developments both on-screen and off. In a 1995 article on Garth, TV Guide reported that the show's creators made a conscious decision to place her character at center stage. An anonymous producer cites \\"faith in Jennie as an actress,\\" further stating that he and producer Aaron Spelling \\"knew she had the chops to do it.\\" This development would gradually lead to Kelly supplanting Brenda as the prominent female lead, as the former received what the producer called \\"better story lines.\\" Reportedly, these matters became a source of tension between Garth and Shannen Doherty, who played Brenda. Following Doherty's final appearance on the show in 1994, however, Garth stated, \\"We were friends at work, and I miss her most of the time.\\" The approach of season 3 marked the beginning of Kelly's rise from supporting player to the main character. Ultimately, throughout the first five seasons, Kelly gained an increasing degree of screen presence and growth. Amidst her continuing development, her role in launching the spin-off, her prominent triangle with Brenda and Dylan, her later affections with male lead Brandon, and the launch of a second triangle with Brandon and Dylan, Kelly became the character that several major events or changes were based around. Additionally, she was given varying involvement in noted story lines not surrounding her--including Dylan's family trauma, Brenda's acting pursuits, and David's recovery from drug use. Her status would become standardized throughout the course of the series' run. In addition to Melrose Place, she would later be used to help launch the third spin-off, 90210 (with Garth being the first performer from the original show to be cast). This development would make Kelly Taylor the most prominent figure in the collective franchise, via the most appearances in episodes and series premieres. Shannen Doherty, who returned as Brenda in the third spin-off, reported that she and Garth, like their characters, had renewed their friendship, stating, \\"Now we‚Äôre really good friends‚Äîand I love her.\\" Adulthood Kelly faced several difficult issues and obstacles, often with the assistance of loved ones, including her occasionally difficult home life, being trapped in a fire, being tricked into joining a cult, and becoming temporarily addicted to cocaine. In addition to many other matters, she endured getting amnesia, shooting her rapist in self- defense, becoming unexpectedly pregnant and having a miscarriage, and learning that it would be difficult for her to have children because of a condition called endometriosis. In overcoming these matters, she was able to become a better person and help others. Tori Spelling's Donna Martin and Kathleen Robertson's Clare Arnold were among Kelly's best friends and roommates. Tiffani Thiessen's Valerie, who replaced Brenda, became Kelly's nemesis, but right before Valerie's departure, the two women formed a truce. Kelly's two most prominent romantic relationships were with Jason Priestley's Brandon and Luke Perry's Dylan. In season 5, she was faced with making a choice between the two, as a result of Brandon proposing and Dylan confessing his feelings for her and asking her to leave with him on a trip around the world. She declined to choose between the two men at that time, instead stating, \\"I choose me,\\" but also affirming her love for both of them. In the seventh season, however, she finally stated that she had chosen Brandon. She nearly married Brandon, but the two decided that they were not ready. Following Jason Priestley's departure from the series, Jennie Garth became the officially billed lead, with the character of Kelly further maturing, reuniting romantically with Dylan, and starting her own PR firm. Melrose Place For the launch of the series Melrose Place in 1992, Jennie Garth made a multi- episode special guest appearance. During the final episodes of Beverly Hills, 90210 season 2, Grant Show played his Melrose Place character Jake, who started a relationship with Kelly which led into early episodes of the spin- off. During Kelly's appearances, her relationship with Jake was largely on- and-off due to his discomfort with her youth. In the end, after weeks of trying to break up with Kelly, Jake pretended to cheat on her, prompting her to leave him. Afterward on both Beverly Hills, 90210 and Melrose Place, Kelly, Donna, Jake, and others made occasional comments concerning Kelly and Jake's brief relationship. 90210 In 2008, Kelly Taylor returned in the spin-off 90210, now working as a guidance counselor at her alma mater West Beverly Hills High School. It was revealed that in the intervening years, she attained a master's degree and had a son named Sammy with Dylan. She and Dylan ended their relationship soon after. It was also revealed that West Beverly principal Harry Wilson was Kelly's neighbor growing up. Kelly's tenuous relationship with her mother Jackie (Ann Gillespie) continued in the series' first season, with tension arising due to Jackie's drunken negligence of Erin, a recurring character in the original series and a regular in the spin-off. She also resumed her friendship with Brenda Walsh. However, their relationship was briefly strained by Kelly's and possibly Brenda's lingering feelings for former boyfriend Dylan McKay, as well as Brenda sleeping with Kelly's ex- boyfriend, Ryan Matthews, a teacher at West Beverly. Following Brenda's discovery that she could not have children, she and Kelly made amends once again. On the night of Donna's moving-back party, Kelly and Ryan met at a convenience store. She was told by a fortune teller that she would meet a man with a six-pack. In his hands, Ryan was holding a six-pack of beer. Kelly and Ryan then went to his apartment, where they were last seen making out. Ultimately, she and Ryan chose not to pursue a romantic relationship. In the second season, Kelly began to spend more time with Harry, much to the chagrin of his wife Debbie. It was implied that both Kelly and Harry had begun to develop feelings for each other. However, Garth refused to participate in a proposed story line involving an affair. Upon learning that Jackie was dying of cancer, Kelly was initially distant from her mother and protective of Erin (who is commonly called by her surname Silver), eventually causing Silver to move out and live with Jackie. The day after Silver's \\"half-birthday,\\" Jackie was admitted to the hospital. After talking to Silver, Kelly gained the strength to visit their mother. Eventually, Kelly and Jackie made amends before Jackie's untimely death. Garth departed the series following season 2, later citing problems with the newly appointed show-runner, Rebecca Sinclair, and the direction the show took. Although not written out after her last appearance, she was mentioned several times later in the show, indicating that she was still around looking after her sister, just not on screen.90210 online viewing The CW.

With regard to Garth's long-running portrayal, Nellie Andreeva of The Hollywood Reporter acknowledged the character of Kelly as being \\"organic to 90210's setting\\" in a 2009 article. On November 24, 2008, SOAPnet aired a Beverly Hills, 90210 marathon titled \\"Kelly's Leftovers\\", dedicated to the character's love life. While discussing the Melrose Place spin-off in a 2009 interview, Grant Show, who played Jake Hanson in the original, stated that he would be open to appearing if Jennie Garth did so as Kelly Taylor. After being confirmed to direct a season 1 episode of the spin-off 90210, Jason Priestley commented that he hoped Jennie Garth would be among the actors present. Sara Foster, who was cast as Jen Clark in the spin-off, has stated that she was excited and nervous about meeting Garth, who she'd watched in the original series. In its biographical article on the actress, Yahoo! states that \\"playing the popular tramp-turned-good girl Kelly through the years afforded Garth the opportunity to not only grow up on camera in front of America, but to fully develop her character and improve her acting chops each season.\\" Additionally, Kelly Taylor has been cited by the media as an inspiration for the character Naomi Clark (AnnaLynne McCord), introduced in 90210.

After Tour√© organized a rally in the Conakry suburb of Gbessia in late 2003, student riots broke out, and as a result Tour√© was detained and questioned. Subsequently, in late April 2004, he was arrested and detained for one night. Tour√© was charged with plotting to overthrow the government, and although he was released on bail, he was barred from politics and from travelling to other countries. He was cleared of the charges by an appeal court in July 2004.

In 2005 the Real Federaci√≥n Espa√±ola de Gimnasia (RFEG), Spain's gymnastics governing body, started to allow for two spots by autonomous community in the open modality of the national championship could to be filled by men, but this was overturned in January 2009 following a statement from the International Federation of Gymnastics that \\"rhythmic gymnastics is a women's sport, and that [the Federation] doesn't have rules for male competition.\\" After the decision was heavily criticized the RFEG stated that the case was being re-evaluated, and on 9 February it was announced that an official male national championship would be established, using the existing rules for the open modality. The first edition of the championship took place in May 2009, in Gij√≥n. Orihuela was the winner in the senior category in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2016.

The term \\"Taiwan, China\\" (‰∏≠ÂõΩÂè∞Êπæ) is used by Chinese media whenever Taiwan is referenced, even though the People's Republic of China (PRC) ‚Äì which is widely recognized by the international community as the legitimate representative of \\"China\\" ‚Äì does not exercise jurisdiction over areas controlled by the Republic of China (ROC). The terms are contentious and potentially ambiguous because they relate to the controversial issues of the political status of Taiwan and Cross-Strait relations between \\"Taiwan\\" and \\"China\\". Since 1949, two \\"Chinas\\" actually exist, namely the Republic of China (ROC, now usually known as \\"Taiwan\\") and the People's Republic of China (PRC, commonly known as \\"China\\"). The use of this term is officially sanctioned by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The ROC government disputes the PRC's position and considers its term incorrect and offensive, along with many of the Taiwanese people and supporters of Taiwan Independence. They maintain that it denies the ROC's sovereignty and existence and reduces Taiwan's status to a province (\\"Taiwan, PRC\\").  Background and ambiguity over \\"China\\"  The dispute and ambiguity over the meaning of \\"China\\" and which \\"China\\" stemmed from the division of Republic of China into two Chinas at the \\"end\\" of the Chinese Civil War in 1955. (Fighting between the two merely eased off after 1949 and no signing of a peace treaty or armistice ever occurred; the PRC still threatens attack on ROC/Taiwan when it deems necessary.) The term \\"China\\" historically meant the various regimes and imperial dynasties which controlled territories in mainland Asia prior to 1911, when the imperial system was overthrown and the Republic of China (ROC) was established as the first republic in Asia. In 1927, the Chinese Civil War started between the Kuomintang (KMT, founding party of the ROC) and the Communist Party of China, a rebel force at the time. The Chinese Communists eventually won control of most of ROC's original territory (mainland China) in 1949, when they proclaimed the \\"People's Republic of China\\" (PRC) on that territory. Since then, two Chinas have existed, although the PRC was not internationally recognized at the time. The Republic of China government received Taiwan in 1945 from Japan, then fled in 1949 to Taiwan with the aim to retake mainland China. Both the ROC and the PRC still officially (constitutionally) claim mainland China and the Taiwan Area as part of their respective territories. In reality, the PRC rules only Mainland China and has no control of but claims Taiwan as part of its territory under its \\"One China Principle\\". The ROC, which only rules the Taiwan Area (composed of Taiwan and its nearby minor islands), became known as \\"Taiwan\\" after its largest island, (an instance of pars pro toto). It stopped active claim of mainland China as part of its territory after constitutional reform in 1991. However, since the 2008 election of Ma Ying-jeou, he again asserted that mainland China is part of Republic of China territory according to its constitution, and, in 2013, he stated that relations between PRC and ROC are not between countries but \\"regions of the same country\\". In 1971, the People's Republic of China won the United Nations seat as \\"China\\" and use of the name and expelled the ROC from the UN. Since then the term \\"Taiwan, China\\" is a designation typically used in international organizations like the United Nations and its associated organs under pressure from the PRC to accommodate its claim and to give the false impression that Taiwan belongs to the PRC. (The term \\"Chinese Taipei\\" was similarly created for the same purpose.) However, the political status of Taiwan is a complex and controversial issue and currently unresolved, in large part due to the United States and the Allies of World War II handling of the surrender of Taiwan from Japan in 1945 (which was to be a temporary administration by the ROC troops), and the Treaty of Peace with Japan (\\"Treaty of San Francisco\\") in 1951, for which neither the ROC nor the PRC was invited, and left Taiwan's sovereignty legally undefined in international law and in dispute.  Ambiguity of \\"Taiwan Province\\"  The term \\"Taiwan, (Province of) China\\" is also potentially ambiguous because both the ROC and the PRC each has administratively a \\"Taiwan Province\\", Taiwan Province, Republic of China and \\"Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China\\", and neither of these provinces covers the Matsu Islands, Wuchiu, Kinmen, all of which have been retained by the Republic of China. Geographically speaking, they both refer to the same place. The existence of the extra term \\"Taiwan Province, PRC\\" is merely because of PRC's insistence that Taiwan is part of China. Without more specific indication, it is unclear to which \\"Taiwan Province\\" is being referred. However, since China (PRC) does not control Taiwan and its \\"Taiwan Province\\" exists only on paper, as a practical matter, \\"Taiwan Province\\" refers only to the Taiwan Province under Republic of China's administration. Although the word \\"China\\" could also possibly be interpreted to mean \\"Republic of China\\", this interpretation is no longer common since \\"China\\" is typically understood as referring to the PRC after the ROC lost its UN seat as \\"China\\" in 1971, and is considered a term distinct from \\"Taiwan\\", the name with which the ROC has become identified. Also, only the ROC's Taiwan Province exists in reality and is under the ROC's actual territorial control, whereas the PRC's \\"Taiwan Province\\" exists only on paper, under the PRC's administrative structure but without an actual provincial government. Instead, the PRC has a Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council to deal with issues and policy guidelines relating to Taiwan. The ROC also does not refer to its Taiwan Province as \\"Taiwan, China\\" in English but rather as \\"Taiwan Province, Republic of China\\" (), and typically such reference only occurs in the Chinese language in the ROC's official documents and as the marquee in the administrative offices of Taiwan Province government. However, references to the province is now rare since the Taiwan Provincial Government has largely been dissolved and its functions transferred to the central government or county governments since 1997. Therefore, recent uses of the term \\"Taiwan, Province of China\\" appears mainly in PRC-controlled media like CCTV (Chinese Central Television) and in the ISO 3166-1 codes to convey the sense that Taiwan is part of its \\"China\\".  Objections = ROC (Taiwan) government  The ROC is prohibited from using its official name internationally under pressure from the PRC and uses \\"Chinese Taipei\\" in other organizations. The ROC sees its use as a denial of the ROC's status as a separate sovereign state, diminishing it under \\"China\\", which implicitly is the PRC. Various instances of the use of the term by international organizations or news media have been met with protest from the Taiwanese government officials and citizens. In an incident on 10 May 2011, the World Health Organization referred to Taiwan as \\"Taiwan, China\\" in its documents. (The ROC participates in the WHO under the name \\"Chinese Taipei\\", due to political pressure from the PRC.) ROC president Ma Ying-jeou protested the WHO's action and accused the PRC of \\"pressuring the UN body into calling\\" the ROC \\"Chinese territory\\", and stated that Beijing's moves were \\"very negative\\" for bilateral ties. Ma, who took office in 2008, has taken many measures to improve Cross-Strait relations.  Taiwan Independence Supporters  The confusion and fight over use of the \\"China\\" name and the lack of name recognition of \\"Republic of China\\" itself and recognition as a country are part of the reason for the supporters of Taiwan independence to push for an identity apart from \\"China\\" and for renaming the ROC and gaining international recognition as \\"Republic of Taiwan\\". Some supporters also reject the legitimacy of Republic of China's takeover of Taiwan from Japan at the end of World War II since 1945 (due to the lack of transfer of sovereignty in the Treaty of Peace with Japan). They also view that Taiwan is no longer part of China since \\"China\\" is recognized by the UN as being the People's Republic of China (PRC) rather than the ROC/Taiwan, so placing \\"Taiwan\\" and \\"China\\" together in one term is not only incorrect and an oxymoron but also offensively denies the ROC's national sovereignty and existence and places it under China.  Usage = The United Nations and the ISO  Non-independent \\"Taiwan, Province of China\\" also appears in the International Organization for Standardization's ISO 3166-1 country codes and ISO 3166-2:TW subdivision codes because its information source, the publication UN Terminology Bulletin-Country Names, lists Taiwan as \\"Taiwan, Province of China\\" due to the PRC's political influence in the United Nations as a member of the UN Security Council. Since the ISO 3166-1 code is commonly used as the data source for a complete list of country and territory names for computer programs and websites, \\"Taiwan, Province of China\\" is sometimes seen on dropdown menus instead of \\"Taiwan\\" for this reason. =Taiwanese reactions= CNS 12842 as the Taiwanese version of ISO 3166 lists Taiwan as independent \\"Taiwan, ROC\\", different from ISO 3166. In 2007, the Republic of China filed a lawsuit before a Swiss civil court against the ISO, arguing that the ISO's use of the United Nations name rather than \\"Republic of China (Taiwan)\\" violated Taiwan's name rights. On 9 September 2010, a panel of the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland decided, by three votes to two, to dismiss the suit as presenting a political question not subject to Swiss civil jurisdiction. The Taipei-based government of the Republic of China encodes the subdivisions of Taiwan with some systems different from ISO 3166-2:TW: *A national identification card has a unique number prefixed by an alphabet for a city or county. *Postal codes in Taiwan encode townships and the equivalents. *The national Code of Household Registration and Conscription Information System (HRCIS Code) covers more than Taiwanese subdivisions.  People's Republic of China  The term is often used in Chinese media whenever the word \\"Taiwan\\" is mentioned, as in news reports and in TV shows. Particularly, when Taiwanese entertainers are on talk shows or being interviewed, the Chinese subtitles on the TV screen would always say \\"Taiwan, China\\" ( / ) despite the fact the person never mentioned the word \\"China\\" ( / ), thereby putting words in the person's mouth. (It is standard practice for Chinese television to display subtitles in all programs.) Also, there has been controversy about Chinese talent shows forcing Taiwanese contestants to introduce themselves as from \\"Taiwan, China\\" or \\"Taipei, China\\" ( / ), with the latter being the PRC's unilateral preferred translation for the term \\"Chinese Taipei\\". For example, Taiwanese singer introduced herself as being from \\"Pingtung District, Taipei, China\\" ( /) on her first appearance on The Voice of China in 2013, despite Pingtung and Taipei being completely distinct areas on opposite sides of Taiwan, causing an uproar among Taiwanese netizens. Her response was that she was instructed to say so by the directors and was nervous. In a rare reversal of this tendency, in July 2017 the PRC's state news agency Xinhua issued a style guide stating that for geographical references, the region should be named \\"Taiwan Area\\" or \\"Taiwan\\" and that it was 'generally now not called' \\"Taiwan Province\\". Its reason for doing so was ostensibly to \\"[take] into account the psychological feelings of Taiwanese.\\" However, the same style guide stated that for any political references, all three of \\"Taiwan\\", \\"Taipei\\", and \\"Chinese Taipei\\" were prohibited in favor of the PRC's preferred \\"Taiwan, China\\" or \\"Taipei, China\\". In addition, it stated that for the use case of publishing statistics that include the mainland but exclude Taiwan, any disclaimer should be explicitly labeled \\"Taiwan Province not included\\" with the word \\"province\\".  United States  If a place of birth on a United States passport application is written as \\"Taiwan, China\\" that cannot be shown in passports as per the One-China policy, the United States Department of State requires its officials to contact the applicant to ascertain whether \\"Taiwan\\" or \\"China\\" is the preferred place of birth to be printed.  Vietnam  In Vietnam, most government documents and many state media usually use the forms [\\"Taiwan (China)\\"] or (\\"Taiwan, China\\") to refer to Taiwan or Republic of China in many contexts, including in music and entertainment coverage.VietNam Airlines t·ªï ch·ª©c ƒëo√†n kh·∫£o s√°t ƒëi·ªÉm ƒë·∫øn ƒê√†i Loan (Trung Qu·ªëc) In other media, they often use the term (\\"territory\\") or (\\"island\\") to refer to Taiwan when wanting to avoid repeating the term \\"Taiwan\\" many times in their article. The term (\\"Taiwan Province\\") sometimes appear in media to refer to all of \\"Taiwan Area\\" (not only referring to the Taiwan Province of ROC). In general, Vietnamese state media never refer to Taiwan as a \\"nation\\" or a \\"state\\". International airlines In April 2018, the China Civil Aviation Authority wrote a letter to 36 airlines throughout the world, including U.S. airlines Delta, United, and American, Canadian airline Air Canada, Japanese JAL and ANA, Air New Zealand, and Qantas of Australia, demanding that they change travel destination cities in Taiwan in their websites to list them under \\"Taiwan, Province of China\\", or directly list them as, for example, \\"Taipei, China\\" and \\"Kaohsiung, China\\" instead of the existing \\"Taipei, Taiwan\\" and \\"Kaohsiung, Taiwan\\". Air Canada and other non-US airlines quickly complied. However, the U.S. airlines requested a time extension to consider the issue, and replied to the Authority that they will confer with the U.S. government regarding the course of action. The White House responded by labeling the move as \\"Orwellian nonsense\\". The China Civil Aviation Authority therefore extended the deadline for U.S. airlines to 25 July 2018 for compliance. All of the resisting U.S. airlines partially gave in to Beijing's demand by the deadline, and dropped all references to Taiwan as a country, listing the city names only (for example, \\"Taipei\\" or \\"Kaohsiung\\" without any mention of which country the city is in).

The movie is generally praised by critics as an effective crime thriller despite its low budget.. Plot Mining engineer Mike Lambert (Glenn Ford) takes a temporary job driving a truck. When the brakes fail while coming down a steep highway, he steers his way through a small town and is lucky to just dent the pickup of Jeff Cunningham (Edgar Buchanan). Jeff demands Mike's employer pay for the damage, but the man refuses. Mike pays him himself. Later, the police find Mike in a bar and arrest him for reckless driving and having an expired license. A total stranger, barmaid Paula Craig (Janis Carter), pays his $50 fine. When Mike gets drunk, Paula quits her job and finds him a hotel room. Then she meets Steve Price (Barry Sullivan) and tells him, \\"I found him\\", a stranger with the same height and build as Steve. The next day, Mike goes looking for a job. The clerk at the assay office puts him in touch with Jeff, a prospector who has found a rich vein in an old, abandoned silver mine. He offers to cut Mike in for 10%, a generous offer he quickly accepts. However, Mike makes the mistake of telling Paula all about it. When Jeff goes to get financing from Steve, the vice-president of the Empire Bank, Paula gets him to turn Jeff down. An opportunist, Steve obtained his position through his wife Beth's father. He has embezzled $250,000 from the bank and hidden it in Paula's safety deposit box. The plan involves a fatal, fiery car crash, with Mike's body to be mistaken for Steve's. Mike wins some money in a craps game and pays Paula back everything she spent on him. He saw her get in the car with Steve, and is very suspicious of a barmaid with much money. Paula tells him she persuaded Steve to reconsider Jeff's financing. Mike, Steve and Paula drive out to see the mine. On the way back, Steve persuades Mike to stop for a drink at his place. However, when Mike goes to wash his hands, he notices a robe with \\"Paula\\" embroidered on it. Mike gets drunk and passes out. Steve drives him to the spot chosen for the accident, but Paula knocks Steve out instead of Mike and sends the car - and Steve - over a cliff. She is able to convince Mike that he accidentally killed Steve in a drunken rage and that she staged the accident to cover for him. She begs him to run away with her. Mike then learns that the authorities know Steve was killed and Jeff has been accused of his murder. After going to see Jeff in jail, Mike suspects Paula, but has no proof. He goes to question Mrs. Woodworth, Steve's secretary, pretending to be a reporter. She confirms that a Helen Bailey called while Jeff was meeting Steve. Mrs Woodworth's suspicious husband calls the police, but Mike punches him and gets away. He asks Paula if she knows Helen Bailey. She denies it, then heads to the bank to get the money. Mike follows her there and confronts her. She begs him to go with her, but he turns her down, and the police, tipped off by him, place her under arrest.

Framed remains a thrilling example of 1940s film noir at its best: economically told, atmospherically photographed (at, among other places, Lake Arrowhead) and more than competently acted.

Nallur Kandaswamy Kovil ( ) is a significant Hindu temple, located in Nallur, Northern Province, Sri Lanka. The presiding deity is Lord Murugan or Katharagama Deviyo in the form of the holy 'Vel' in the Sanctum, the primary shrine, and in other forms, namely, Shanmugar, Muthukumaraswami, Valli Kaanthar with consorts Valli and Deivayanai, and Thandayuthapani, sans consorts in secondary shrines in the temple.  Origins ‚Äì The earlier shrines of Kandaswamy in Nallur  The original, Kandaswamy Temple was founded in 948 ad. According to the Yalpana Vaipava Malai, the temple was developed at the site in the 13th century by Buwanika Bahu, a minister to the King of Kotte. Sapumal Kumaraya (also known as Chempaha Perumal in Tamil), who ruled the Jaffna kingdom on behalf of the Kotte kingdom is credited with building the third Nallur Kandaswamy temple.Peebles, History of Sri Lanka, p. 34Gnanaprakasar, S A critical history of Jaffna, p. 103 Nallur served as the capital of the Jaffna kings, with the royal palace situated very close to the temple. Nallur was built with four entrances with gates. There were two main roadways and four temples at the four gateways. The present rebuilt temple that exist now do not match their original locations which instead are occupied by churches erected by the Portuguese. The center of the city was Muthirai Santhai (market place) and was surrounded by a square fortification around it. There were courtly buildings for the kings, Brahmin priests, soldiers and other service providers. The old Kandaswamy temple functioned as a defensive fort with high walls. In general, the city was laid out like the traditional temple town according to Hindu traditions. Cankilian Thoppu, the facade of the palace of King Cankili II, can still be found in Nallur.Kunarasa, K The Jaffna Dynasty, p. 4 The third temple was destroyed by the Portuguese Catholic colonial Filipe de Oliveira in 1624 AD. The original kovil was located where St. James' Church, Nallur is located today. Part of the original Shivalingam of the Nallur Kandaswamy Temple was located in the Vicarage till 1995 when it was destroyed during the recapture of Jaffna by Sri Lanka armed forces and the platform where the shivalingam was mounted on can still be seen in the hallway of the vicarage.  Present Temple  The fourth and the present temple was constructed in 1734 A.D. during the benign Dutch colonial era by 'Don Juan' Ragunatha Maapaana Mudaliyar, who served as a Shroff in the Dutch Katchery, in a place identified then as the 'Kurukkal Valavu. Krishnaiyar a Brahmin, served as the first priest of the temple. Initially the temple was built using bricks and stones and had a cadjan roof, enshrining a 'Vel' in the middle. The original shrine had only two small halls. Ragunatha Maapaana Mudaliyar's descendants continued to administer the temple as Custodians of the temple over the past centuries and to date many additions have been made to bring the temple to its present Glory. The start of the 'Golden Period' in the history of Nallur Temple is recorded as post 1890, soon after the taking over the temple administration by Arumuga Maapaana Mudaliyar, the 7th Custodian. The first Bell tower was erected by him in 1899 and he made many improvements to the temple including the main Sanctum, renovating it using granite to pave the floor of the Sanctum in 1902. The first enclosing wall was erected in 1909 by him. Likewise, the temple has been gradually renovated from time to time by his successors to date. After the year 1964, the year the present and the 10th Custodian, Kumaradas Maapaana Mudaliyar took over office, extensive improvements have been made to date, virtually rebuilding the entire complex and making it physically the largest Hindu Temple Complex in the country. The custom of annual 'Thiruppani', introduced by him, has seen the temple growing into its present splendor. Today the temple has four Gopurams and six Bell Towers, along with its fortified walls, giving it an appearance of a citadel in Nallur. The temple has the main entrance facing the east. It has an ornately carved five-story tower or gopuram in the Dravidian architecture style at the main entrance. In the surrounding inner veethy or circumbulatory path, it has shrines for Lords Ganesh, Palliyarai, Sandana Gopalar, Goddess Gajavalli Mahavalli, Vairavar and Sooriyan with Consorts, and Vairavar. In the southern part of this temple, the holy pond and Thandayudhapaani shrine can be seen. In the northern side, one finds the 'Poonthottam' the holy garden.  Social significance  The temple is a socially important institution for the Sri Lankan Tamils Hindu identity of north Sri Lanka. In the Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora, many temples have been built in Europe and North America using the same name as a cultural memory. Thanks to its Administration and strict decipline admired and revered by the devotees, Nallur Kovil is the epitome of punctuality, order and neatness, and provides a model for all Saiva temples. Above all it is the manner in which religious ceremonies are conducted with such impeccable timing and strict discipline that makes it a favourite amongst devotees.  New Raja Gopuram Additions  Newly built gopuram at the southern side On 21 August 2011 the temple unveiled its new Nine storey Raja Gopuram, Named 'Shanmuha Raja Gopuram' with an entrance called ' Swarna Vaasal' ( The Golden Entrance ) at 7:00am local time. Another New Raja Gopuram was unveiled on 4 September 2015 at 07 a.m. local time, creating a new Northern entrance to the temple complex. It is known as 'Gubera Raja Gopuram', and the entrance named 'Kubera Vaasal'. This tower, slightly over powers the Southern tower and to date recorded as the biggest Gopuram in the Island. 'Guberan' is the deity for wealth and he protects the Northern direction. It is believed by the local people that this Gopuram will attract more wealth to the people of Jaffna peninsula.  Festivals  The temple hosts the annual festival which begins with the hoisting of the Holy flag ‚Äì the Kodiyetram.http://kataragama.org/centers/nallur.htm/ The cloth for hoisting is ceremonially brought to the temple in a small chariot from a family belonging to the Sengunthar Kaikola Mudaliyar dynasty, for centuries. The festival is spread over a period of twenty five days during which various YƒÅgams Abishekams and special poojas are conducted. The major religious festivals people flock to witness are the Manjam, Thirukkarthikai, Kailasavahanam, Velvimanam, Thandayuthepani it's a am, Sapparam, Ther festival procession, Theertham ‚Äì the water cutting festival, and Thirukalyanam ‚Äì The holy wedding. The Ther Thiruvila (chariot festival) is the most popular of all events is very colourful and commences at 6.15 am . The glamorously dressed Lord Shanmuhar and his consorts are carried out on a Silver Throne called 'Simmasanam', an intricatetly carved masterpiece created by the 7th Custodian, Arumuga Maapaana Mudaliyar in the year 1900. Hundreds of devotees carrying it on their shoulders, and the Simmasanam which floats on the heads of thousands of devotees shouting 'Aro hara' is a sight not to be missed. The huge and heavy chariot carrying the statue of God Shanmuhar and consorts is paraded along the streets of the Temple. The chariot pulled by a rope of thousands of devotees, rich and poor, old and young stand shoulder to shoulder in pulling it giving God Murugan the opportunity to witness the sincerity and purity of the devotees.

Born in Llangynhafal, Denbighshire Wales in 1811, he graduated from Jesus College, Oxford in 1835 to become the Anglican curate of Llanfor, Merionethshire, where he married Elizabeth Lloyd Williams. In 1843 he became perpetual curate of Nercwys, Flintshire, and rector of Llanymawddwy, Merionethshire, in 1849. Writing career For much of his early life he adopted the pseudonym Cynhaval, after his birthplace in Llangynhafal, Denbighshire, however took the pseudonym Ab Ithel from the surname of his grandfather, William Bethell. His first book entitled The Church of England independent of the Church of Rome in all ages, concerned the relationship between the Church of England and Rome. This book was published in 1836. It was followed by another in 1844 on the ecclesiastical antiquities of Wales entitled Ecclesiastical Antiquities of the Cymry or The Ancient British Church. In 1856 Archdeacon Williams produced Rules of Welsh Poetry and Medical Practice of Rhinwallon and his Sons with the Welsh MSS. Society. By 1860 he had two more pieces of work ready for publication; Chronicle of the Princes, and Annales Cambriae were both published in Rolls series. Williams was industrious both as a parish priest and as an antiquary. He was regarded by many of his contemporaries as one of the leading Welsh scholars of his day, and was able to exert a considerable and decidedly mixed influence on the course of Welsh scholarship. Nonetheless his enthusiasm and Welsh nationalist fervour, cause some to criticize him of being uncritical in his approach to the historical record and strongly influenced by Edward Williams (Iolo Morganwg, 1747‚Äì1826). Professional contributions In 1846, together with Harry Longueville Jones (1806‚Äì1870), another cleric and antiquary, Williams founded the Cambrian Archaeological Association, whose journal, Archaeologia Cambrensis, he edited until 1853, when he and Jones quarrelled over editorial policy. He also published an edition and translation of the Gododdin in 1852, established the Cambrian Journal, which he edited from 1854 until his death, and was prominent in the Welsh Manuscripts Society, editing four of its publications. The Llangollen Eisteddfod of 1858, which he organized together with Richard Williams Morgan ('Mor Meirion', c. 1815 ‚Äì c. 1889) and Joseph Hughes ('Carn Ingli', 1803‚Äì1863), caused much derision and embarrassment; Williams' own family won several prizes, and Thomas Stephens (1821‚Äì1875) was adjudicated against because he suggested that the story of Madog ab Owain Gwynedd's American expeditions was not true. Williams was nevertheless considered for the chair of Celtic at Oxford University, and he was appointed by the government in 1858 to complete the editions of the medieval Welsh chronicles Annales Cambriae and Brut y Tywysogion, which had been left incomplete by Aneurin Owen (1792‚Äì1851), and which were published in 1860. His editorial work was later criticised by academics due to his lack of the diplomatic skills for interpreting medieval manuscripts. Religious appointments Williams became rector of Llanenddwyn and Llanddwywe, Merionethshire, in 1862, by which time he was very ill, and he died in the same year. The Ab Ithel Memorial Fund was established in his memory. Writings, letters, and collections Many of the letters and papers of Rev. John Williams ('Ab Ithel') and his family exist today in drafts or incomplete copy. His collection includes letters to his family 1832‚Äì1898; page-proofs of parts of Brut y Tywysogion; drafts in manuscript of several of Ab Ithel's printed works, including Y Gododdin, The Traditionary Annals of the Cymry, Druidism, Brut y Tywysogion, and Annales Cambriae; contributions to the Cambrian Journal; his address at the Conwy Eisteddfod, 1861; papers relating to his collation to the rectory of Llanymawddwy, 1849; 'The Church of England independent of the Church of Rome in all ages'; sermons in English and Welsh; 'A few plain and practical Observations on Anglican Education'; the prize essay on the question 'whether the British Druids offered human sacrifices' by 'Hu Gadarn'; an essay entitled 'Traethawd ar Ddarganfyddiad yr America Gan Madog ab Owain Gwynedd, yn nghylch y ddeuddegfed ganrif' by 'Columbus'; an essay 'On the state of Agriculture and the progress of Arts & Manufactures in Britain, during the period & under the influence of the Druidical System' by Rev. John Jones, Llanllyfni (see Archaeologia Cambrensis, Supplement 1850); 'Y Telynwr Cymreig, sef cyfarwyddiadau i ddysgu'r Delyn' by 'Dafydd Frenin'; four essays on 'Y manteision a ddeillia i'r Cymry o ddysgu yr iaith Seisnig' by 'Uthr Bendragon', 'Eiddil', 'Gwir Gymro', and 'Y cynyg cynta' 'rioed'; a 'History of Wales to the death of Llewelyn'; sections of a work on Christianity in Britain; letters addressed to Ab Ithel and also to his wife and daughters; press cuttings and extracts; sketches and medical and household recipes, and letters, 1884‚Äì1885, relating to the Ab Ithel Memorial Fund.

He was also canonized as a Christian saint. Biography Fabius Claudius Gordianus Fulgentius was born in the year 462 at Telepte (modern-day Medinet-el-Kedima), Tunisia, North Africa, into a senatorial family. His grandfather, Gordianus, a senator of Carthage, was despoiled of his possessions by the invader Genseric, then banished to Italy. His two sons returned after his death; though their house in Carthage had been taken over by Arian priests, they recovered some property in Byzacene. His father Claudius died when Fulgentius was still quite young. His mother Mariana taught him to speak Greek and Latin. Fulgentius became particularly fluent with the former, speaking it like a native. His biographer says that at an early age Fulgentius committed the entire works of Homer to memory. He quickly gained wide public respect for the conduct of his family's affairs. This reputation helped him to acquire a post as a procurator or tax collector of Byzacena. He soon grew tired of the material life, and this combined with his religious studies, particularly a sermon of Augustine of Hippo on Psalm 36, which dealt with the transitory nature of physical life, convinced him to become a monk. Around the year 499 he set out to join the hermits of the Thebaid in Egypt, but changed his mind when he learned from Eulalius, Bishop of Syracuse, of the influence of monophysitism on Egyptian monasticism.\\"Saint Fulgentius of Ruspe, bishop\\", Order of Saint Augustine He applied to Faustus, a bishop who had been forced from his diocese by the Vandal king Huneric and later set up a monastery at Byzacena. Faustus tried to dissuade Fulgentius because his physical weakness made him a poor candidate for the rigorous life of the monastery. When Fulgentius persisted, Faustus admitted him on a trial basis.Burns, Paul. Butler's Lives of the Saints:New Full Edition. Collegeville, MN:The Liturgical Press, 1995. . Upon learning of her son's decision, Mariana, who evidently had never been told of Fulgentius's wish, was very upset. She rushed to the gates of the monastery, demanding to know how a church that was supposed to protect widows could deprive her of her only son. Her protestations were ineffective, and Fulgentius was ultimately confirmed in his vocation. Renewed Arian attacks on the area forced Fulgentius to leave for another nearby monastery. The abbot there, Felix, gave Fulgentius the duty of managing the temporal affairs of the monastery, while he managed the spiritual affairs. The two of them worked well together, and so in 499, during another wave of persecution, they both fled for Sicca Veneria. A local Arian priest had them arrested and tortured after learning the pair were preaching the orthodox Nicene teaching. In 500, he visited Rome, where he prayed at the tombs of the apostles. His visit coincided with a formal address to the people by king Theodoric, which confirmed Fulgentius in his low esteem for the earthly vanities of this world. He then returned to Byzacena, where he built a monastery, electing to live in an isolated cell. Fulgentius's reputation quickly spread, and he was several times offered the post of bishop of one of the dioceses which had been vacated through the actions of the Arian king Thrasamund. He chose not to accept these offers, knowing Thrasamund had specifically ordered that only Arians be permitted to fill those seats. Bishop of Ruspe In 502 Fulgentius was persuaded to take the post of bishop of Ruspe in Tunisia. His obvious virtues made a strong impression on the people of his new diocese, but he was soon banished to Sardinia with some sixty other bishops who did not hold the Arian position. Pope Symmachus knew of their plight and sent them annual provisions of food and money. While in Sardinia, Fulgentius turned a house in Cagliari into a monastery, and determined to write a number of works to help instruct the Christians of Africa. In 515, he returned to Africa, having been summoned there by Thrasamund for a public debate with his Arian replacement. His book, An Answer to Ten Objections, is supposed to have been collected from the answers he had made regarding objections to the catholic Nicene position. Thrasamund, impressed by Fulgentius' knowledge and learning, and fearing social discord if these persuasive arguments fell into the hands of his Arian subjects, ordered that all Fulgentius' future statements could only be delivered orally. Fulgentius responded with a further rebuttal to the Arian position, now known as the Three Books to King Thrasamund. Thrasamund's respect for Fulgentius grew, leading him to allow Fulgentius to stay in Carthage, but after renewed complaints from the local Arian clergy he banished Fulgentius back to Sardinia in 520. Fulgentius founded several communities not only in Africa, but also in Sardinia. In 523, following the death of Thrasamund and the accession of his Catholic son Hilderic, Fulgentius was allowed to return to Ruspe and try to convert the populace to the Catholic position. He worked to reform many of the abuses which had infiltrated his old diocese in his absence. The power and effectiveness of his preaching was so profound that his archbishop, Boniface of Carthage, wept openly every time he heard Fulgentius preach, and publicly thanked God for giving such a preacher to his church. Tensions with Quodvultdeus (died c.450) over precedence appear to have been overcome by Fulgentius' modest concessions. Later, Fulgentius retired to a monastery on the island of Circinia (Kerkenna), but was recalled to Ruspe and served there until his death on 1 January 527 or 533. Vita The Life of Fulgentius, (generally attributed to Ferrandus of Carthage, but more recently to Redemptus a monk of Telepte) is of value to historians as a record of migrations of social √©lites to Italy, Sicily and Sardinia due to vicissitudes of the Vandal rulers in North Africa, navigation in the Western Mediterranean, estate management, and the development of an episcopal monastic familia. Writings As a theologian, Fulgentius's work shows knowledge of Greek and a strong agreement with Augustine of Hippo. He wrote frequently against Arianism and Pelagianism. Some letters and eight sermons survive by Fulgentius. During the Middle Ages, he was conflated with Fabius Planciades Fulgentius and considered the author of the famous Mythologies, but this identification is now questioned. Doctrine=Filioque Fulgentius writes in his Letter to Peter on the Faith: \\"Hold most firmly and never doubt that the same Holy Spirit, who is the one Spirit of the Father and the Son, proceeds from the Father and the Son. For the Son says, 'When the Spirit of Truth comes, who has proceeded from the Father,' where he taught that the Spirit is his, because he is the Truth.\\"St. Fulgentius of Ruspe, Letter to Peter on the Faith II. 54. Veneration His saint's day is January 1, the day of his death. His relics were transferred to Bourges in France around 714. They were destroyed during the French Revolution.

Its use in government funded schools has been the most controversial, as critics contend that a government-sanctioned endorsement of religion violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Arguments against the pledge include that the pledge itself is incompatible with democracy and freedom, pledges of allegiance are features of totalitarian states such as Nazi Germany, and that the pledge was written to honor Christopher Columbus and to sell flags.  Objections on the grounds of religion  Even before the addition of the phrase \\"under God\\" in 1954, legal challenges were frequently founded on the basis of freedom of religion. Central to early challenges were Jehovah's Witnesses, a group whose beliefs preclude swearing loyalty to any power lesser than God. In the 1940 Supreme Court case Minersville School District vs. Gobitis, an 8‚Äì1 majority in the Court held that a school district's interest in promoting national unity permitted it to require Witness students to recite the Pledge along with their class mates. Gobitis was an unpopular decision in the press, and it led to a rash of mob violence and intimidation against Jehovah's Witnesses; three years later in West Virginia State Board of Education vs. Barnette, the Court reversed itself, voting 6‚Äì3 to forbid a school from requiring the Pledge. As a result, since 1943 public schools have been disallowed from punishing students for not reciting the Pledge. Nonetheless, it remains taught to and expected of school children in many schools, as the Court leaves many details in such matters up to respective state governments. More specific objections have been raised since the addition of the phrase \\"under God\\" to the Pledge. The year of its addition, 1954, was also near the beginning of the Cold War anti-communist movement in the United States. Matter of Lewis v. Allen In response to the June 14, 1954 Congressional change of the wording of the Pledge (found in U.S. Code, tit. 36 ¬ß 172) to include \\"under God\\", a series of lawsuits were filed in the New York State courts by Joseph L. Lewis challenging the constitutionality of the addition of the new phrase. Lewis was a publisher, writer, and co-founder of Freethinkers of America. As the cases involved Joseph Lewis desiring the Court to order the Commissioner of Education of The State of New York, James E. Allen, Jr. to remove the new words from the Pledge, these cases are referred to as the Matter of Lewis v. Allen. =1957 case= The first case brought by Lewis found its way to the New York State Supreme Court in 1957. Joseph Lewis maintained that the Commissioner of Education of the State of New York had a duty, which he had failed to perform, to revoke the regulation requiring the recitation of the Pledge with the new phrase, and reinstate the old wording. Lewis did not cite any state regulations concerning the Commissioner, but held the Commissioner was bound to act by the U.S. First Amendment (which was applied to the State governments through the Fourteenth Amendment) and by article I and XI of the New York State Constitution. The court held that it was not within the Commissioner's domain to determine the constitutionality of acts performed by the State or Federal Legislatures. The Court then turned to Lewis' contention that the New York law that ordered the recitation of the Pledge had been rendered unconstitutional by the new wording, \\"Petitioners claim that freethinkers, nonbelievers, atheists and agnostics cannot be compelled to recite the present pledge of allegiance because it includes the words 'under God', and such compulsion violates the aforesaid constitutional provisions.\\" Referencing the 1943 case West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette which resulted in fines and threats of imprisonment against those refusing to say the pledge being ruled unconstitutional, the Court held that \\"The regulation under attack here has no compulsory aspect. No penalties attach to a failure or refusal to recite the pledge.The pledge is made voluntarily and no penalties are imposed for noncompliance.\\" Having pointed out that neither threats nor actual imprisonment or deprivation of property had made for noncompliance, the Court moved onto the other half of the definition of \\"establishment\\" set out in Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson's concurring opinion in McCollum v. Board of Education. New York State Justice Isadore Bookstein wrote \\"If I properly apprehend the intent, design and purposes of the First Amendment, it was conceived to prevent and prohibit the establishment of a State Religion; it was not intended to prevent or prohibit the growth and development of a Religious State.\\" Operating on the interpretation of the First Amendment that holds that the state is prohibited from establishing a single religion or denomination as the official religion, but is free to support all religions in general (as long as it shows none of them preference above the others), Justice Bookstein listed several examples felt to support that interpretation. These included Supreme Court rulings such as the 1892 Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States which stated \\"this is a religious nation\\", and the 1952 ruling Zorach v. Clauson which stated \\"We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.\\" Bookstein also cited wording in the Declaration of Independence, the Gettysburg Address, and the preamble of the New York Constitution which expressed gratitude \\"to Almighty God for our Freedom\\". In addition the Justice pointed out that American coins had \\"In God we trust\\" inscribed on them (a practice that had been implemented sporadically since 1864), and pointed to the Presidential oath of \\"So help me, God\\" (he made no mention that the Constitution gives the president-elect the option to affirm without invoking a deity). Bookstein wrote \\"If petitioners' contention be sound, it may be wondered whether the public school curriculum might properly include the Declaration of Independence and the Gettysburg Address. Could \\"America\\" (\\"Protect us by thy might, Great God, our King!\\") be sung in a public school without offending the First Amendment? And might not the presidential oath of office have questionable constitutional status?\\" The Justice held with House Report No. 1693 that the Zorach v. Clauson case \\"clearly indicated that the references to the Almighty which run through our laws, our public rituals, and our ceremonies in no way flout the provisions of the First Amendment. ... [for] if this recognition of the Almighty was not so, then even a fastidious atheist or agnostic could object to the way in which the Court itself opens each of its sessions, namely, 'God save the United States and the Honorable Court'.\\" Bookstein held that \\"the child of a nonbeliever may simply omit the words, 'under God', in reciting the pledge. His 'non-conformity', if such it be, will not, in the circumstances of this case, set him apart from his fellow students or bring 'pressure' to bear in any real sense.\\" Bookstein again cited Zorach v. Clauson holding that to side with Lewis' claims against the government would be preferring those who believe in no religion over those who do not'. The First Amendment does not require this.\\" Justice Bookstein's words in this ruling were later quoted by the state of New York in one of its briefs, when defending its position in the Engel v. Vitale case before the United States Supreme Court. =1960 case= Lewis brought a similar argument in 1960 holding that the Pledge with the new words was unconstitutional \\"as it involves 'the use of the public schools‚Äîboth physically and pedagogically‚Äîfor the dissemination of purely religious dogma' and, second, as it imposes 'an intolerable degree of compulsion upon the young children of non-believers ... to listen to, learn and repeat thousands of time a religious concept which they repudiate and abhor. The Court cited New York's recent decision in the case Engles v. Vitale where the state had allowed officials of a school district to order its teachers to teach and lead students in a nondenominational prayer crafted by the government to remain in place as long as more safeguards were put into place to insure that students and parents were informed that children could remove themselves from the classroom if they did not wish to participate or be exposed to the prayer crafted by the New York board of Regents (this decision was later reversed by the United States Supreme court in 1963). The New York Court held that due to the 1943 case West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette there was general knowledge that there could be no compulsion on students to participate or expose themselves to the Pledge. The Court dismissed Lewis' claims that the pledge was an establishment of religion citing Zorach v. Clauson, \\"There cannot be the slightest doubt that the First Amendment reflect the philosophy that Church and State should be separated. ... The First Amendment, however, does not say that in every and all respects there shall be a separation of Church and State. Rather, it studiously defines the manner, the specific ways, in which there shall be no concert or union or dependency one on the other. That is the common sense of the matter. Otherwise the state and religion would be aliens to each other‚Äîhostile, suspicious, and even unfriendly. ... Prayers in our legislative halls; the appeals to the Almighty that run through our laws, our public rituals, our ceremonies would be flouting the First Amendment.\\" The court also dismissed Lewis' argument that the Pledge violated New York's Constitution that forbids the use of public money or other property in aid of any denominational school or any school' in which any denominational tenet or doctrine is taught\\". Stating simply \\"From our determination that the claim of unconstitutionality under the First Amendment cannot be sustained, it follows that the regulation does not contravene the like provisions of the State Constitution.\\" Lewis appealed this decision to the New York Court of Appeals in 1964, they affirmed the previous decision which ruled against his position.  Links to the school prayer controversy  The use of the Pledge of Allegiance has been cited in landmark cases concerning government led prayer within public schools. These decisions, made in the 1960s, were often seen suspiciously as they occurred during the Cold War against the USSR which was officially atheistic. In addition, many Southern politicians saw these rulings, along with the concurrent decisions advancing racial Civil Rights, as an assault on State's Rights. =Invoking the Pledge in Engel v. Vitale= In 1962 the United States Supreme Court addressed the question of whether a government led school prayer \\"to be said in conjunction with the Pledge of Allegiance and 'as an incident to the Pledge of Allegiance ceremony was constitutional in the case Engel v. Vitale. In the state's briefs, \\"the insertion of the words 'under God' in the Pledge of Allegiance\\" was cited as one of the \\"literally countless illustrations ... [to] the fact that belief and trust in a Supreme Being was from the beginning and has been continuously part of the very essence of the American plan of government\\". In part, the state of New York defended the prayer by equating its effects with the Pledge, saying in one of their briefs \\"The Regents' Prayer ... serves as a simple reminder that Americans trust in God, as the Pledge of Allegiance serves as a simple reminder of our obligations to our 'one nation under God'.\\" They pointed out that \\"The challenged recitation follows the pledge of allegiance, which itself refers to God\\", and held that if the court outlawed the government-crafted prayer due to \\"the conscientious objections of the minority\\" that \\"Such a determination would require not only that the Regents' Prayer be discontinued, but also that all schools cease the voluntary recitation of the pledge of allegiance, which, as amended by 36 U.S.C. ¬ß172, contains the words 'under God'.\\" The Court ruled that government-crafted and led prayer was unconstitutional. The decision was highly controversial, and obiter dictum within Justice William O. Douglas' concurring opinion received particular attention. Justice Douglas' obiter dictum In his obiter dictum, Douglas postulated what the reasoning of the ruling might have on current government practices. He wrote: \\"The point for decision is whether the Government can constitutionally finance a religious exercise. Our system at the federal and state levels is presently honeycombed with such financing. Nevertheless, I think it is an unconstitutional undertaking whatever form it takes.\\" In a footnote illustrating \\"such financing\\", he also noted that \\"The slogan 'In God We Trust' is used by the Treasury Department, and Congress recently added God to the pledge of allegiance\\", thereby calling those practices' constitutionality under question as well. Opponents of the decision (including legislators calling for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to reverse its effects) saw Douglas' obiter dictum as a likely indicator of future decisions including the end of daily recitals of the Pledge in schools. Senator Absalom Willis Robertson berated the decision and declared \\"We have no clear assurance that the Court will not follow the broad concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Douglas in rendering future decisions. That is why I say we cannot sit complacently\\". Senator Herman Talmadge asked Robertson, \\"[Can you theorize] If they did what their decision presages? It would remove all the chaplains in the armed services, the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, the word 'God' in The Star-Spangled Banner, and everything else that the American Republic has held dear throughout the history of our country.\\" To which Robertson replied \\"That is the clear implication of the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Douglas.\\" Senator Wayne Morse, despite coming to an acceptance of the ruling, expressed concern if Douglas' dicta did not indicate a coming end to many practices within the government including the Pledge, saying \\"Undoubtedly the special concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Douglas will have some persuasive influence not only on practicing lawyers, but also on lower courts. ... [Still, as it is only dicta] what Mr. Justice Douglas said in many parts of the decision does not involve principles and tenets which are yet the law of the land.\\" =Mention of the Pledge in Abington School District v. Schempp= While the move to amend the Constitution to reverse the effects of Engel v. Vitale did not get out of the Congressional Judiciary Committees, and the calls to impeach the Justices or to establish a \\"Court of the States\\" (that would allow representatives of the states to act as a court above the Supreme Court) failed to gather support, another school prayer case came before the Court in 1963. The Court was asked to rule on practices in the states of Pennsylvania and Maryland. In this case, called Abington School District v. Schempp, the Court considered whether school officials could read aloud or have students read aloud Bible passages for devotional purposes which \\"was followed by a standing recitation of the Lord's Prayer, together with the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag by the class in unison\\". The Court ruled against the state, but avoided saying anything similar to the highly controversial dicta Justice Douglas had previous written. The decision did specifically mention the Pledge at several points. The Court theorized that the Pledge might be constitutional if either the words \\"under God\\" inserted in 1954 had, due to the passage of time, lost their religious meaning by 1963, or if one equated a personal public declaration of loyalty with the act of reading a document created by a historical figure‚Äî\\"This general principle might also serve to insulate the various patriotic exercises and activities used in the public schools and elsewhere which, whatever may have been their origins, no longer have a religious purpose or meaning. The reference to divinity in the revised pledge of allegiance, for example, may merely recognize the historical fact that our Nation was believed to have been founded 'under God'. Thus reciting the pledge may be no more of a religious exercise than the reading aloud of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, which contains an allusion to the same historical fact.\\" With this reasoning the Supreme Court specifically categorized the Pledge as secular, contrasting it to the religious exercises under consideration. The Court held that if, as the states claimed, Bible reading and The Lord's Prayer were being used to achieve secular ends (\\"fostering harmony and tolerance among the pupils\\") than \\"it would seem that less sensitive materials might equally well serve the same purpose. ... It has not been shown that readings from the speeches and messages of great Americans, for example, or from the documents of our heritage of liberty, daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, or even the observance of a moment of reverent silence at the opening of class, may not adequately serve the solely secular purposes of the devotional activities without jeopardizing either the religious liberties of any members of the community or the proper degree of separation between the spheres of religion and government. Such substitutes would, I think, be unsatisfactory or inadequate only to the extent that the present activities do in fact serve religious goals. While I do not question the judgment of experienced educators that the challenged practices may well achieve valuable secular ends, it seems to me that the State acts unconstitutionally if it either sets about to attain even indirectly religious ends by religious means, or if it uses religious means to serve secular ends where secular means would suffice.\\" As Justice Douglas' obiter dictum had included questioning the constitutionality of the fact that \\"There is Bible-reading in the schools of the District of Columbia\\" the controversy over the Court's rulings did not die out. =Parker v. Board of Education= On June 17, 1963, the same day that the Schempp case was decided, A. L. Wirin, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, filed a lawsuit on behalf of Haswell Parker, a fifty-one-year-old high school history teacher. Parker, who \\"said he did not belong to any church\\", objected \\"as a matter of personal conscience\\" to the Los Angeles Board of Education's policy (instated in 1959) that made daily recitation of the pledge with the 1954 addition of the words \\"under God\\" mandatory. This action was decried by both the media and politicians, such as Alan H. Newcomb of WBT-TC who was cited by Senator Sam Ervin, he stated \\"almost before that opinion [Schempp] was understood by the people, the Civil Liberties Union brought suit ... We suggest that the history teacher study his history. The trend toward eradicating all reference to God from every official document and act in this country is not merely protecting a few tiny minorities from a fancied infringement of their rights. It goes far deeper than that. If carried to the ultimate conclusion, it would destroy the whole American philosophy of human liberty.\\" The constitutionality of the Pledge was not challenged in 1963 as the Los Angeles Board of Education \\"advised the court it will not require Parker to lead the pledge of allegiance\\". Parker and Wirin dropped the suit on October 4, 1963.  2003 District ruling  Teachers or any other staff also cannot be forced to participate in the pledge. In the case of Lane v. Owens, three teachers and six students sued the Colorado state government over a 2003 law requiring daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance by students and teachers. Granting the plaintiffs a temporary restraining order, U.S. District Judge Lewis Babcock said: \\"It doesn't matter whether you're a teacher, a student, a citizen, an administrator, or anyone else, it is beyond the power of the authority of government to compel the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance\\". Colorado subsequently (2004) amended the law to remove the requirement to recite the Pledge.  2005 District ruling  In early 2005, Dr. Michael Newdow brought a new lawsuit on behalf of himself and others. On September 14, 2005, U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton ruled that it violated the Establishment Clause for public schools to lead their students in the Pledge of Allegiance to comply with California's requiring the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. The judge said he was bound by 2002 precedent of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision even though it had been vacated by the Supreme Court. Judge Karlton held that the words \\"one nation under God\\" violate the right to be \\"free from a coercive requirement to affirm God\\". On November 30, 2005, the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, an organization claiming to defend religious rights for people of all faiths, appealed the case to the Ninth Circuit and filed a brief that declared, object to the ruling that the pledge violates any part of the Establishment Clause.\\" Derek Gaubatz, Director of Litigation for the Becket Fund, said his group would appeal the decision \\"if necessary to the Supreme Court to get that ruling reversed to secure the constitutionality of the pledge once and for all\\".  \\"Under God\\" ruling  The words \\"under God\\" were added to the Pledge on June 14, 1954 when then U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed a bill into law. At the time, Eisenhower stated that \\"From this day forward, the millions of our school children will daily proclaim in every city and town, every village and rural schoolhouse, the dedication of our Nation and our people to the Almighty.\\" The matter of the Pledge's constitutionality simmered for decades below the public eye. In 1992, the Chicago-based Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals decided the first challenge to the constitutionality of the words \\"under God\\", ruling in Sherman v. Community Consolidated School District 21 that the use of the words \\"under God\\" in the Pledge did not violate the Establishment Clause. On June 26, 2002, in a case (Newdow v. United States Congress) brought by an atheist father objecting to the Pledge being taught in his daughter's school, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled the addition of \\"under God\\" an unconstitutional endorsement of monotheism. Shortly after the ruling's release, Judge Alfred T. Goodwin, author of the opinion in the 2‚Äì1 ruling, signed an order staying its enforcement until the full Ninth Circuit court could decide whether to hear an appeal. The day after the ruling, the Senate voted in favor of the Pledge as it stood. The House followed suit, accepting a similar resolution.http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c107:H.+Res.+459: The Senate vote was 99‚Äì0 (Senator Jesse Helms could not attend, but had been expected to vote \\"yes\\"); the House 416‚Äì3 with 11 abstaining. President George W. Bush and many other politicians spoke out in favor of the existing Pledge. The stay on the ruling was lifted on February 28, 2003 when the full Ninth Circuit court of appeals decided not to take the case, letting the ruling stand. A second stay was granted, however, to give the school district time to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. If it had held, the court's ruling would have affected more than 9.6 million students in Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington and Guam. In the months following the court's decision, Attorneys General from all 50 states filed papers asking the Supreme Court of the United States to review the decision, 49 of whom joined a legal brief sponsored by Oklahoma Attorney General Drew Edmondson and Idaho Attorney General Lawrence Wasden. California filed a separate brief, also urging the Supreme Court to hear the case. On January 12, 2004, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal on March 24 of the same year. Justice Antonin Scalia recused himself from the case after he had criticized the Ninth Circuit judgment in the Newdow case. Note that this is the article used by Newdow to request Scalia's recusal - see where difference in reporting between AP and local paper noted, and for criticism of the reporting. On June 14, 2004, the Supreme Court rejected Newdow's claim by an 8‚Äì0 vote, stating that as a non- custodial parent, he did not have standing to act as his daughter's legal representative. In August 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held 3‚Äì0 in Myers v. Loudoun County Public Schools that teacher-led recitations of the Pledge did not violate the Establishment Clause. The Plaintiff in that case, Edward Myers, decided not to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.  General patterns in issues of church and state  The points-of-view, compromises, and personal interests in this matter are often viewed as examples of a wider debate over the role of religion in U.S. government. Several dissenting Supreme Court Justices concluded that U.S. judges exceed their authority in decisions on issues of religion. Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia wrote, and Chief Justice William Rehnquist agreed, that \\"the Court's position is the repressive one\\" when the Supreme Court approved of the lower courts declaring a law unconstitutional because it mandated that teaching of \\"evolution science\\" be balanced by teaching of \\"creation science.\\" (Edwards v. Aguillard, Text of the court decision at FindLaw). Justice Scalia has also said that courts have gone too far to keep religion out of public schools and other forums, and that the Pledge of Allegiance question would be better decided by lawmakers than judges. The Supreme Court has banned some expressions of \\"God\\" from public schools. For example, in 1962 the Supreme Court banned the teacher-led recitation of the invocation, \\"Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers and our Country.\\" Text of the court decision at FindLaw This objectionable \\"Almighty God\\" recitation was voluntary, of the same nature as the Pledge of Allegiance. In the same 1962 case, the Court admitted that the \\"God save this honorable court\\" invocation uttered at the beginning of each Court session was a \\"prayer.\\" However, the Court also ruled that \\"A religion is not established in the usual sense merely by letting those who choose to do so say the prayer that the public school teacher leads.\\" Rather, the Court found fault with the teacher-led prayer because the State of New York had financed a religious exercise in requiring the teacher-led recitation of the prayer. Nevertheless, neither the parents nor the Court made the same assertion regarding the Pledge of Allegiance.  Definition of \\"religious exercise\\"  The dissenting justice in the 2002 \\"Under God\\" ruling stated that the ruling conflicted with the Supreme Court's explicit stance that the phrase \\"under God\\" is merely a ceremonial reference to history and not an affirmation of religious faith. Opponents contend that this contradicts the 1954 House Report of the legislators who inserted the \\"under God\\" phrase into the Pledge, which stated that the words \\"under God\\" served to \\"acknowledge the dependence of our people and our Government upon the moral directions of the Creator.\\" 154 U.S.C.A.A.N 2339, 2340. The plaintiff, Michael Newdow, an atheist, took issue with the phrase \\"In God We Trust\\" on the coins of American currency, believing that the phrase was a state-sponsored statement of religious faith‚Äîillegal under the separation of church and state. He argued that he had a right to raise his daughter \\"without God being imposed into her life by her school teachers.\\" Some of the judges in the 2002 ruling agreed that Newdow had a right to direct the religious education of his daughter. Newdow explained his view of 'freedom of religious exercise' by asking whether Christians would be glad if the atheists were in the majority and if the atheists inserted into the pledge of allegiance the phrase \\"one nation under NO God.\\" In an interview with Connie Chung, Newdow stated, \\"The Constitution says the congress will make no laws respecting an establishment of religion which means that the Supreme Court says, and as you have said, nobody should be made to feel like an outsider. And I would only ask everyone of those people to ask themselves, if they had to say every morning when they pledged allegiance to the flag, that we were one nation under Sun Myung Moon, or one nation under David Koresh, or one nation under Jesus, or one nation under Mohammad, how would they feel?\\" Thus Newdow claimed that the reference to God is meaningful, and hence the court should recognize, and correct, the resulting religious bias.  Objection that the Pledge promotes a socialist state  Francis Bellamy, the author of the Pledge, was a former Baptist minister who preached that Jesus was a socialist. He was allied ideologically with his cousin, Edward Bellamy, one of the most renowned socialists of the late 19th century. Strongly opposed to capitalism, Francis advocated income taxation, central banking, nationalized education, nationalization of industry, and other tenets of socialism. A primary objective of his was to replace the existing federalist view of the country (where states are sovereign) in the public's mind with a nationalist one that would open the way to creating a centralized government. When provided the opportunity to write a pledge to the American flag in a campaign to sell flags to public schools, Bellamy turned to the words and principles of socialism. Put simply, if American youth could to be taught \\"loyalty to the State\\", it would pave the way for the socialist utopia that was described in his famous socialist cousin Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward. The central idea of \\"one nation\\" in the pledge was especially important for achieving his vision of the kind of consolidated, monopoly government necessary for a socialism to be adopted. Additionally, he considered adding the socialist bywords, \\"liberty, fraternity and equality\\", but knew that state superintendents of education on his committee were against equality for women and African Americans. As Bellamy believed youth should be trained in devotion to the State, the public schools as a government institution were the perfect setting for planting the requisite fervent loyalty and patriotism. To promote the Pledge nationwide, a \\"National Public School Celebration\\" was held 1892 on Columbus Day. It was the first government sponsored propaganda event on behalf of the Pledge of Allegiance. It was a massive campaign that involved government schools and politicians throughout the country. Not only was the Pledge recited en masse for the first time at the behest of government, but public schools were promoted while private schools, especially parochial ones, were criticized.  Other objections and rulings  Some people generally oppose the pledge because they feel that the mandatory recital of what amounts to an oath, particularly by children, led by government employees in public schools, is a form of compulsory speech, amounting to indoctrination, that is the antithesis of the liberty the flag itself represents. Indeed, in Barnette, Justices Black and Douglas wrote in a concurring opinion, \\"Words uttered under coercion are proof of loyalty to nothing but self-interest. Love of country must spring from willing hearts and free minds, inspired by a fair administration of wise laws enacted by the people's elected representatives within the bounds of express constitutional prohibitions.\\" Likewise, the majority opinion by Justice Robert Jackson, included one of the great statements in American constitutional law and history, stated: \\"If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.\\" Specific criticisms of the pledge include: # The assertion that it amounts to idolatry # That the noble ideal of liberty and justice for all it espouses, ignores and overlooks: #* the prison population #* American internment camps during WWIINPR: George Takei Takes Story Of Internment To The Stage August 29, 2012 #* wrongful convictions and executions # Perceived encroachments on First and Fourth Amendment freedoms # That it encourages blind patriotism at the expense of actual civic engagement and action  2006 District ruling  In the 2006 Florida case Frazier v. Alexandre, No. 05-81142 (S.D. Fla. May 31, 2006), \\"A federal district court in Florida ruled that a 1942 state law requiring students to stand and recite the Pledge of Allegiance violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, even though the law allows students to opt out, because they can only do so with written parental permission and are still required to stand during the recitation. Cameron Frazier, a student at Boynton Beach High School, was removed from a class after he refused to follow his teacher's instructions to recite the Pledge or stand during recitation.\\" References External links  * Lawmakers blast Pledge ruling, CNN, June 27, 2002 * N.I.N.U.G., A refutation of indivisibility and the phrase \\"under God\\". * Recall Election Over Pledge Of Allegiance Reinstated * The Pledge of Allegiance ‚Äì Why we're not one nation \\"under God.\\" by David Greenberg.

It was ratified on 15 November 1959 at an SPD party convention in the town of Bad Godesberg which is today part of Bonn. The Godesberg program represented a fundamental change in the orientation and goals of the SPD. It rejected the goal of replacing capitalism, adopting a commitment to reform capitalism and a people's party orientation that appealed to ethical considerations and ejected its class- based orientation. Godesberg rejected nationalization as a major principle of socialism.  Overview  The Godesberg Program eliminated the party's remaining orthodox Marxist policies and the SPD redefined its ideology as freiheitlicher Sozialismus (liberal socialism). With the adoption of the Godesberg Program, it renounced orthodox Marxist class conflict and economic determinism. The SPD replaced it with an ethical socialism based on humanism and emphasized that it was democratic, pragmatic and reformist. The most controversial decision of the Godesberg Program was its declaration stating that private ownership of the means of production \\"can claim protection by society as long as it does not hinder the establishment of social justice\\". By accepting free-market principles, the SPD argued that a truly free market would in fact have to be a regulated market to not to degenerate into oligarchy. This policy also meant the endorsement of Keynesian economic management, social welfare and a degree of economic planning. Some argue that this was an abandonment of the classical conception of socialism as involving the replacement of the capitalist economic system. It declared that the SPD \\"no longer considered nationalization the major principle of a socialist economy but only one of several (and then only the last) means of controlling economic concentration of power of key industries\\" while also committing the SPD to an economic stance which promotes \\"as much competition as possible, as much planning as necessary\\". The decision to abandon the traditional anti- capitalist policy angered many in the SPD who had supported it. After those changes, the SPD enacted the two major pillars of what would become the modern social-democratic program, namely making the party a people's party rather than a party solely representing the working class and abandoning remaining Marxist policies aimed at destroying capitalism and replacing them with policies aimed at reforming capitalism. The Godesberg Program divorced its conception of socialism from Marxism, declaring that democratic socialism in Europe was \\"rooted in Christian ethics, humanism, and classical philosophy\\". The Godesberg Program was a major revision of the SPD's policies and gained attention from beyond Germany. At the time of its adoption, the stance on the Godesberg Program in neighbouring France was not uniform. While the French Section of the Workers' International was divided on the Godesberg Program, the Unified Socialist Party denounced the Godesberg Program as a renunciation of socialism and an opportunistic reaction to the SPD's electoral defeats. The Godesberg program was also notable because the party abandoned and rejected Marxist theories of class conflict and revolution. This was consistent with Eduard Bernstein's Marxist revisionism. In adopting the Godesberg Program, the SPD dropped its hostility to capitalism which had long been the core of party ideology and sought to move beyond its old working class base to embrace the full spectrum of potential voters, adopting a political ideology grounded in ethical appeals. Nonetheless, they adhered to the Marxist analysis put forward by social democrats such as Bernstein that socialism would arise as a result of the evolution of capitalism. In this sense, the Godesberg Program has been seen as involving the final victory of the reformist agenda of Bernstein over the orthodox Marxist agenda of Karl Kautsky. Labor unions had abandoned the old demands for nationalization and instead cooperated increasingly with industry, achieving labor representation on corporate boards and increases in wages and benefits. After losing federal elections in 1953 and 1957, the SPD moved toward an American-style image-driven electoral strategy that stressed personalities, specifically Berlin mayor Willy Brandt. As it prepared for the 1961 federal election, it proved necessary as well in 1960 to drop opposition to rearmament and to accept NATO. The Godesberg Program was superseded in 1989 by the Berlin Program, resolved at the party congress held on 20 December 1989 in Berlin.

Battle On 8 February 1942, the Japanese landed a large force on the western side of Singapore Island. Throughout the following days, further troops were landed and heavy fighting followed as they pushed the mainly Australian defenders from the 22nd Brigade back from their positions on the coast. On 10 February further landings were made against the northern positions occupied by the 27th Brigade between the River Kranji and the Causeway, and steadily the British and Commonwealth lines were pushed back south-east towards the centre of the island. As the Japanese began advancing towards the strategically important Bukit Timah which offered vital supplies including water, British, Indian, and Australian troops from a variety of units fought actions along the Bukit Timah Road in an effort to blunt the advance. As the Japanese 5th Division, with armoured support, advanced down the Choa Chu Kang Road, British troops and Chinese volunteers from the irregular Dalforce engaged in desperate hand-to- hand fighting, but being poorly equipped, they were forced back and by midnight the Japanese had occupied Bukit Timah. On 11 February, two British brigades attempted a counter-attack, but this was turned back; the following day, the Japanese Imperial Guards, outflanked the British positions from the north, and forced them to withdraw. Dalforce was engaged in further fighting, which resulted in heavy Japanese casualties; in revenge the Japanese killed a large number of Chinese civilians nearby after the fighting.

They are fourteen kilometres away from Landshut, between Essenbach and Niederaichbach. Safety=Passive safety features The safety feature begins with the passive safety feature which includes the radioactive materials in the reactor core (also by accidents) to protect them from the outside environment. Fuel pellets, Fuel- Rod casings, reactor pressure vessel, biological shield, steel containment structure and the outer ferro concrete mantle are six of the most important passive safety features. Active safety features The passive safety installations are supplemented by a lot of automatically working active safety systems whose reliableness is based on their plural existence and their autonomously working in separate rooms. This is as necessary for the internal electric power supply as for the reactor cooling system, which guarantees the reliable thermal dissipation in every operating status, even when an implausible accident ingresses (for example a break of a primary coolant line). It constantly controls and compares all the important key operating parameters of the plant and activates automatically the necessary protection measures (independent from the plant operating personnel) if a parameter reaches a limit value. For example, the protection system may initiate a rapid shutdown and aftercooling procedure. The future=On-site storage facilities Fuel assembly container storage facility on the area of the Isar nuclear power plant By law, all German nuclear power plants are forced to store their atomic waste in on-site storage facilities near the power plant. These temporary storage facilities have to be used until a final processing plant is built in a central location in Germany, to where all nuclear power plants will send their atomic waste. The usage of this storage is planned from 2030 onwards, so interim storage facilities are necessary. The nuclear power plants Isar must also therefore have its own temporary storage facility, which has been under construction since 15 June 2004. Work on the temporary storage facility at the Isar location was marked by protest actions from environmentalist and resident groups, which voiced concern about possible health effects. The interim storage facility of Isar nuclear power plant is in use since 2007 and provides capacity for 152 fuel element containers. Phasing-out of nuclear power Concerns for the safety of nuclear power production were greatly increased after the Chernobyl accident in 1986, eventually leading to plans for its phase-out in certain countries. According to German Nuclear Phase-out regulations, Isar-I was to be shut down in 2011, with operations in Isar-II continuing until 2021. After the March 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan, however, the decision was made to expedite shutdown. Isar-I was closed as of 17 March 2011 for a three-month moratorium on nuclear power the result of that moratorium announced in the early hours of 30 May 2011 was that Isar-I would not return. Isar-II, being one of the strongest (ca. 1,400 MW) and most modern reactors in Germany, is supposed to run until the end of the phase-out (2022).

In reference to the tendency of these wrens to enter small crevices as they search for food. is a genus of small passerine birds in the wren family. These wrens are around long. They are brownish above and somewhat paler below, with strong legs. Their short rounded wings and frequently cocked tail have a dark barred pattern. The flight is direct and buzzing. Troglodytes wrens are mostly found in somewhat cooler habitats than most of their relatives. Most of the species are found in the mountains from Mexico to northern South America. Five species are found in temperate latitudes: The house wren occurs widely in both tropical and temperate lowlands, but is frequently split into several species. Until recently, the hardy winter wren was believed to have a wide distribution in North America, Europe, Asia and North Africa, but it has recently been split into three species, of which the Eurasian wren is the only wren of any genus found outside the New World. The Cobb's wren of the Falkland Islands is another species which tolerates harsh conditions well. Like other wrens, they are elusive as they hunt for small insects and spiders, but they readily reveal their positions through their loud songs. These are territorial birds, but the tiny winter wren will roost communally in a cavity in cold weather to help conserve heat. Systematics and species The genus Troglodytes was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1809. Dated 1807 on title page but not published until 1809. The type species was subsequently designated as the house wren (Troglodytes aedon). The closest living relatives of this genus are possibly the timberline wren and the Cistothorus species, rather than the Henicorhina wood-wrens as is sometimes proposed. A number of the Troglodytes species, such as the Clari√≥n wren, were formerly considered subspecies of the house wren, and it has been argued that at least the tropical forms of the house wren should be further split as the southern house wren, Troglodytes musculus. The Socorro wren, in older times placed into Thryomanes (Bewick's wren), is actually a close relative of the house wren complex, as indicated by \\"manners, song, plumage, etc.\\" and by biogeography and mtDNA NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence analysis. The winter wren is less closely related to the other members of the genus, and is occasionally split as the monotypic genus Nannus. It might actually be closely related to Cistothorus, but again, the molecular data is insufficient to properly resolve this issue. Even with the help of the most recent molecular data, the relationships of the species could not be fully resolved, however. There appear to be two clades, one comprising the house wren group and another containing Central and South American species. The relationships of the rufous-browed and brown-throated wrens are indeterminable with the present molecular data; they appear fairly basal and the former might be closer to the house wren group than the latter. The Santa Marta wren is quite enigmatic and little-studied.

Her younger sister, Empress Elizabeth I, ruled between 1741 and 1762. While a potential heir in the reign of her nephew, she never acceded to the throne due to political reasons. However, her son Peter would rule as Emperor in 1762, succeeding Elizabeth. She was the Duchess Consort of Holstein-Gottorp by marriage. Early life Anna was born out of wedlock, although her parents were married in 1712 and she was later legitimized. Her earlier illegitimacy would pose great challenges for her marriage. Anna grew up in the houses of Peter's younger sister Natalia and Prince Alexander Menshikov. Although born illegitimate, she and her younger sister Elizabeth were awarded the titles of \\"princess\\" (tsarevna) on 6 March 1711 and \\"crown princess\\" (tsesarevna) on 23 December 1721. Peter planned to marry his daughters to foreign princes in order to gain European allies for the Russian Empire. The two girls were educated with this aim in mind, learning literature, writing, embroidery, dancing and etiquette. Anna developed into an intelligent, well-read girl who spoke four foreign languages ‚Äì French, German, Italian and Swedish. Anna's shyness was evident at an early age. One witness describes the amusing hitch that once occurred during the traditional exchanging of Easter kisses. When the duke of Holstein-Gottorp tried to kiss the fourteen-year-old Anna, she turned bright red in embarrassment, while her younger sister \\"immediately stuck out her little pink mouth for a kiss.\\" Foreign visitors to the Russian court were struck by the uncommon beauty of Anna. The dark-eyed Anna looked more like her father and was considered more level-headed and intelligent than her younger sister, the fair-haired Elizabeth. A contemporary described Anna: \\"She was a beautiful soul in a beautiful body ... both in appearance and in manners, she was [her father‚Äôs] complete likeness, particularly in her character and mind ... set off by her kind heart.\\" Marriage On 17 March 1721, Karl Friedrich arrived in Imperial Russia to get acquainted with his future wife and father-in-law. He aspired to use the marriage in order to ensure Russia's support for his plans of retrieving Schleswig from Denmark. He also entertained hopes of being backed up by Russia in his claims to the Swedish throne. Under the terms of the Treaty of Nystad Russia promised not to interfere in the internal affairs of Sweden, so his hopes proved ill-founded. Another possible candidate as a husband was Prince Louis d‚ÄôOrl√©ans, Duke of Orl√©ans, a son of Prince Philippe II d‚ÄôOrl√©ans, Duke of Orl√©ans and his wife Madame Fran√ßoise Marie de Bourbon (an illegitimate daughter of King Louis XIV of France and his Chief Mistress, Fran√ßoise-Ath√©na√Øs, Madame de Montespan). The marriage proposal was ignored due to a difference in style of address. Anna was addressed as Her Imperial Highness and Louis was as His Serene Highness. As a favorite child of Peter the Great, Anna's name day (3 February) was taken to be a national holiday in 1724. On 22 November 1724, the marriage contract was signed between Karl Friedrich and Peter. By this contract, Anna and Karl Friedrich renounced all rights and claims to the crown of the Russian Empire on behalf of themselves and their descendants. However a secret clause allowed the Emperor to name a successor out of any issue from the marriage. As a result of this clause, the Emperor secured the right to name any of his descendants as his successor on the Russian throne. A few months thereafter, by January 1725, Peter the Great fell mortally ill. As the story goes, on his deathbed he managed to spell the words: to give all..., but could not continue further and sent for Anna to dictate his last will to her. By the time the princess arrived, the Emperor could not pronounce a single word. Based on the story, some historians speculated that Peter's wish was to leave the throne to Anna, but this is not confirmed.  Catherine I  After the accession of her mother Catherine I, a grand wedding was held for Anna in Trinity Cathedral, Saint Petersburg on 21 May 1725. The wedding party then crossed the River Neva to the Summer Garden, where Mikhail Zemtsov had designed a special banqueting hall for the occasion. The tables were set with all sorts of delicacies, including enormous pies. When the orchestra began to play, male and female dwarves jumped out of the pies and began to dance on the tables. Each toast was accompanied by cannon fire from a nearby yacht and the guards regiments positioned on Tsaritsa Meadow. The following day, everyone was invited to Peterhof, where the banqueting and dancing continued in the Upper Palace. Carl Friedrich and Anna spent the next two years in Saint Petersburg. Catherine I made her son-in-law a lieutenant colonel of the Preobrazhensky Regiment and a member of the Supreme Privy Council. He began to play an important role in the life of the Russian Empire and foreign diplomats predicted that the empress would name Anna as her successor. The Duke was admitted into the newly established Supreme Secret Council and exerted a moderate influence on Russian politics. Catherine I's death in 1727 made his position precarious, as the power shifted to the hands of Alexander Menshikov, who aspired to marry the young emperor, Peter II, to his own daughter, Maria Menshikov. A quarrel between the Duke and Menshikov resulted in the former's withdrawing to Holstein on 25 July 1727. Before her departure for Holstein, Anna was asked to sign a receipt for all the money awarded to her as her dowry. For a long time, the document was not accepted by the government, because it gave the old title of Peter's daughter ‚Äì Tsesarevna (crown princess of Russia). Now, she was not the Crown Princess.  Kiel  On 25 July 1727, Anna and her husband left Saint Petersburg for Kiel. When they arrived in the capital of Holstein, the duke underwent a personality change. Merry and gallant in Saint Petersburg, he was now a rude, drunken boor. He spent his time in the rowdy company of friends and other women, leaving his wife, now pregnant, entirely on her own. In Kiel, Anna would spend her days writing long, tearful letters to her sister Elizabeth. Semyon Mordvinov, a lieutenant in the Russian navy, remembers Anna crying bitterly when she gave him her mail to take back to Russia. In one such letter to Elizabeth, she writes: ‚ÄúNot a day passes without my weeping for you, my dear sister!‚Äù Birth of Peter III and death On 21 February 1728, Anna gave birth in Kiel Castle to a son named Carl Peter Ulrich, the future Peter III of Russia. Peter would found the House of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov that would go on to rule Russia until the early 20th-century. A few days after his birth, the barely twenty-year-old duchess caught puerperal fever (postpartum infection) and died on 4 March 1728. In memory of his wife, Karl Friedrich founded the Order of St Anna, which subsequently became a Russian decoration. Before her death, Anna Petrovna had asked to be buried alongside her father in Saint Petersburg. Two ships, the Raphael and the Cruiser, were dispatched to Kiel for Anna's body. The coffin was transported up the River Neva on a galley, with long black crape hanging overboard, trailing in the water. On 12 November 1728, Anna was laid to rest next to her parents in the still unfinished St Peter and St Paul Cathedral.  Issue  Through her marriage with the Duke Karl Friedrich, she had one son * Prince Peter Feodorovich, Hereditary Duke of Holstein-Gottorp (21 February 1728 - 17 July 1762). In 1739, Peter's father died, and he became The Duke of Holstein-Gottorp as Karl Peter Ulrich. He could thus be considered the heir to both thrones (Russia and Sweden). After the death of his aunt, Elizabeth of Russia, he ruled over the Russian Empire as Peter III, Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias and was the husband of Catherine the Great of Russia. Through him, Anna became ancestress to all subsequent rulers of Russia except Empress Catherine II (her daughter-in-law). Legacy * The Order of Saint Anna (Russian: –û—Ä–¥–µ–Ω —Å–≤—è—Ç–æ–π –ê–Ω–Ω—ã) was a Holstein and then Russian order of chivalry established by Anna's husband on 14 February 1735, in honour of Anna. The motto of the Order was \\"Amantibus Justitiam, Pietatem, Fidem\\" (\\"To those who Love Justice, Piety and Fidelity\\"). Its festival day was 3 February. * Through her son she is an ancestor of Maria Vladimirovna of Russia, Head of the House of Romanov and Heir to the Former Russian Throne (disputed).

Medical laboratory scientists work in clinical laboratories at hospitals, reference labs, biotechnology labs and non-clinical industrial labs. Those that work in non clinical industrial labs are often referred to as biomedical laboratory technologist (BLT) in parts of the world. Job duties MLS in his work environment Medical laboratory scientists work in all areas of the clinical laboratory, including blood banking, chemistry, hematology, immunology, histology and microbiology . They perform a full range of laboratory tests ‚Äì from simple prenatal blood tests to more complex tests to uncover diseases such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes, and cancer. They are also responsible for confirming the accuracy of test results, and reporting laboratory findings to pathologists and other physicians. The information that a medical laboratory scientist gives to the doctor influences the medical treatment a patient will receive. Medical laboratory scientists operate complex electronic equipment, computers, and precision instruments costing millions of dollars. Medical Laboratory Scientists analyze human fluid samples using techniques available to the clinical laboratory, such as manual white blood cell differentials/counts, bone marrow counts, analysis via microscopy, and advanced analytical equipment. Medical laboratory scientists assist doctors and nurses in choosing the correct lab tests and ensure proper collection methods. Medical laboratory scientists receive the patient specimens, analyze the specimens and report results. A pathologist may confirm a diagnostic result, but often the medical laboratory scientist is responsible for interpreting and communicating critical patient results to the physician. Medical laboratory scientists must recognize anomalies in their test results and know how to correct problems with the instrumentation. They monitor, screen, and troubleshoot analyzers featuring the latest technology available on the market. The MLS performs equipment validations, calibrations, quality controls, \\"STAT\\" or run-by-run assessment, statistical control of observed data, and recording normal operations. To maintain the integrity of the laboratory process, the medical laboratory scientist recognizes factors that could introduce error and rejects contaminated or sub-standard specimens, as well as investigates discrepant results. A typical laboratory performs hundreds of different tests with a number of methodologies. Common tests performed by medical laboratory scientists are complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), electrolyte panel, liver function tests (LFT), renal function tests (RFT), thyroid function test (TFT), urinalysis, coagulation profile, lipid profile, blood type, semen analysis (for fertility and post-vasectomy studies), serological studies and routine cultures. In some facilities that have few phlebotomists, or none at all, (such as in rural areas) medical laboratory scientists may perform phlebotomy on patients, as this skill is part of the clinical training. Because medical laboratory scientists are skilled in diverse scientific disciplines, employment outside of the medical laboratory is common. Many MLS are employed in government positions such as the FDA, USDA, non-medical industrial laboratories, and manufacturing. The practical experience required to obtain the bachelor's degree in medical technology give the MLS a unique understanding of the inter- relationship between microbiological and chemical testing and the resulting clinical manifestations in clinical, scientific, and industrial settings. In the United Kingdom and the United States, senior laboratory scientists, who are typically post-doctoral scientists, take on significantly greater clinical responsibilities in the laboratory. In the United States these scientists may function in the role of clinical laboratory directors, while in the United Kingdom they are known as consultant clinical scientists. Though clinical scientists have existed in the UK National Health Service for ~60 years, the introduction of formally trained and accredited consultant level clinical scientists is relatively new, and was introduced as part of the new Modernising Scientific Careers framework. Consultant clinical scientists are expected to provide expert scientific and clinical leadership alongside and, at the same level as, medical consultant colleagues. While specialists in healthcare science will follow protocols, procedures and clinical guidelines, consultant clinical scientists will help shape future guidelines and the implementation of new and emerging technologies to help advance patient care. Role in the healthcare process A Medical Laboratory Scientist's role is to provide accurate laboratory results in a timely manner. An estimated 70 percent of all decisions regarding a patient's diagnosis and treatment, hospital admission and discharge are based on laboratory test results. in the United Kingdom, Healthcare Scientists including Clinical Scientists may intervene throughout entire care pathways from diagnostic tests to therapeutic treatments and rehabilitation. Although this workforce comprises approximately 5% of the healthcare workforce in the UK, their work underpins 80% of all diagnoses and clinical decisions made. Specialty areas Many Medical Laboratory Scientists are generalists, skilled in most areas of the clinical laboratory. However some are specialists, qualified by unique undergraduate education or additional training to perform more complex analyses than usual within a specific field. Specialties include clinical biochemistry, hematology, coagulation, microbiology, bacteriology, toxicology, virology, parasitology, mycology, immunology, immunohematology (blood bank), histopathology, histocompatibility, cytopathology, genetics, cytogenetics, electron microscopy, and IVF labs. Medical Technologists specialty may use additional credentials, such as \\"SBB\\" (Specialist in Blood Banking) from the American Association of Blood Banks, \\"SM\\" (Specialist in Microbiology) from the American Society for Microbiology, \\"SC\\" (Specialist in Chemistry) from the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, or \\"SH\\" (Specialist in Hematology) from the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP). These additional notations may be appended to the base credential, for example, \\"MLS(ASCP)SBB\\". Additional information can be found in the ASCP Procedures for Examination & Certification. Andrology Laboratory Scientist, Embryology Laboratory Scientist, and Molecular Diagnostics Technologist certifications are provided by the American Association of Bioanalysts; those with the certifications are classified as ALS(AAB), ELS(AAB), and MDxT(AAB) respectively. Certified Histocompatibility Associate, Certified Histocompatibility Technologist, Certified Histocompatibility Specialist, and Diplomate of the ABHI are titles granted by the American Board of Hisocompatibility and Immunogenetics after meeting education and experience requirements and passing the required examination; those individuals would hold the credentials CHA(ABHI), CHT(ABHI), CHS(AHBI), and D(ABHI) upon passing the corresponding examination.http://www.ashi- hla.org/images/uploads/ABHIhandbookJanuary2015CM1.pdf In the United States, Medical Laboratory Scientists can be certified and employed in infection control. These professionals monitor and report infectious disease findings to help limit iatrogenic and nosocomial infections. They may also educate other healthcare workers about such problems and ways to minimize them.Infection Control Certification In the United Kingdom the number of Clinical Scientists in a pathology discipline are typically greater, where less medically qualified pathologists train as consultants. Clinical Biochemistry, Clinical Immunology and Genomic Medicine are specialities with an abundance of UK Clinical Scientists, and where the role is well established. Infection services in the United Kingdom are generally undertaken by medically qualified Microbiologists, who may have overall responsibility for laboratory services in addition to Infection Prevention and Control responsibilities, and may be required to contribute to ward rounds and patient clinics. Therefore, the Royal College of Pathologists and Royal College of Physicians have developed Combined Infection Training[10], that medical trainees gain a much more patient focused experience, and undertake Physician examinations in addition to Pathology training. The end result of this is that several regional medical deaneries no longer permit Medical Doctors to train in Microbiology or Virology as single disciplines, and instead advocate dual-specialisation as Infectious Disease/Microbiology or Infectious Disease/Virology [11]. Simultaneously the expansion of higher specialist scientist trainees in microbiology mean that many of the laboratory and scientific responsibilities of medical doctors may be taken on by Clinical Scientists, and medical doctors will instead be expected to perform a much more patient facing role. The exception in Microbiology is the sub-discipline of Virology, which is well suited to the expertise of clinical scientists due to reliance on cutting edge scientific methods, increasing use of specialised genetic technologies, and a technical understanding of virus biology, with a reduced emphasis on patient management compared with Microbiology as a whole[12]. It is therefore likely that many patients in UK hospitals may come into contact with Clinical Scientists working in a patient facing speciality, who may be confused with medical doctors due to the complex nature of their role. Educational requirements Educational and licensing requirements vary by country due to differing scopes of practice and legislative differences.  Australia  In Australia, medical laboratory scientists complete a four-year undergraduate degree program in medical laboratory science or Master of Medical Laboratory science . These programs should be accredited by the Australian Institute of Medical Scientists (AIMS).  Canada  In Canada, three-year college or technical school programs are offered that include seven semesters, two of them comprising an unpaid internship. The student graduates before taking a standard examination (such as the Canadian Society for Medical Laboratory Science, or CSMLS, exam) to be qualified as a medical laboratory technologist. Many MLTs go on to receive a bachelor of science degree after they are certified, but a few university programs affiliated with a college MLT program to allow students to graduate with both MLT certification and a degree such as the University of New Brunswick's Bachelor of Medical Laboratory Sciences program. Canada is currently experiencing an increasing problem with staffing shortages in medical laboratories.  New Zealand  In New Zealand, a medical laboratory scientist must complete a bachelor's degree in medical laboratory science or biological or chemical science recognized by the Medical Sciences Council of New Zealand. As part of this degree they must complete clinical placement. Once they graduate they must have worked at least six months under supervision, be registered with the Medical Sciences Counsel of New Zealand, and hold a current Annual Practicing Certificate. Ghana In Ghana, a doctor of medical laboratory scientist (MLS.D) is a professional with a six (6) years professional doctorate degree in medical laboratory science, the medical laboratory scientist (MLS) has four (4) years bachelor's degree in medical laboratory science and the medical laboratory technicians (MLT) has three (3) years diploma in medical laboratory science. The curriculum for the programme include clinical rotations, where the students get hands-on experiences in each discipline of the laboratory and performs diagnostic testing in a functioning laboratory under supervision. Pakistan In Pakistan National Institute of Health (NIH) Islamabad is the pioneer in Laboratory Sciences, College of Medical Lab Technology, (CMLT), NIH, Islamabad offers 2 years F.Sc in Medical Lab Technology (MLT), Previously 2 Years B.Sc (MLT) that was discontinued and replaced by 4 years Bachelor Program in Medical Lab Sciences. University of Health Sciences, Lahore also offering 4 year Bachelor program in Medical Lab Sciences through approved colleges. University of Lahore, University of Faisalabad, University of Sargodha and Superior University Lahore offering 5-years Doctor of Medical Lab Sciences (DMLS) Program; Eligibility criteria for 4 years BS Medical Lab Sciences and 5 years Doctor of Medical Lab Sciences (DMLS) is F.Sc Pre-Medical. United States In the United States, a medical laboratory scientist (MLS), medical technologist (MT), or a clinical laboratory scientist (CLS) typically earns a bachelor's degree in medical laboratory science, clinical laboratory science, or medical technology. Other routes include attaining a degree in biomedical science or in a life / biological science (biology, biochemistry, microbiology, etc.). Both routes typically requires the MLS/MT/CLS to obtain certification from a national certifying board (AAB, AMT, or ASCP) as most laboratories exceed the federal minimum requirements established by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). Common comprehensive Medical laboratory scientist degree programs are set up in a few different ways. * In 3+1 programs, the student attends classroom courses for three years and complete a clinical rotation their final year of study. * In 2+2 programs, students have already completed their lower division coursework and return to complete their last two years of study in a CLS program. * In 4+1 program, students who have already completed an undergraduate program return to complete a year of medical laboratory training. The training is typically completed at a clinical site rather than a college. The core curriculum in medical technology generally comprises 20 credits in clinical chemistry, 20 credits in hematology, and 20 credits in clinical microbiology. During clinical rotations, the student experiences hands-on learning in each discipline of the laboratory and performs diagnostic testing in a functioning laboratory under supervision. With limited or no compensation, a student in the clinical phase of training usually works 40 hours per week for 20 to 52 weeks. Some programs in the United States have halved the time students spend completing their clinical rotation reduced due to staffing shortages. For example, in 2015, the MLS program at the University of Minnesota reduced the clinical rotation portion of the program from 22 weeks to 12 weeks. In the United States, a two-year academic program (associate's degree) qualifies the graduate to work as a medical laboratory technician (MLT). MLTs receive training more exclusively in laboratory sciences without the basic science coursework often required by MLS programs; however, there are many MLT training programs that require substantial basic didactic science course work prior to entry into a clinical practicum. Although the didactic coursework may be less for the MLT, the clinical practicum, in many cases, is similar to that of the MLS student's. This equates to MLTs who are well equipped to enter the work force with relevant and knowledge based practical application. The shorter training time may be attractive to many students, but there are disadvantages to this route. MTs, MLSs and CLSs usually earn higher salaries and have more responsibilities than MLTs. In 2018, medical laboratory technicians earned an average salary of $51,219, while medical laboratory scientists earned a salary of $67,888. An added disadvantage for MLTs is that some institutions will only employ MLSs, although that practice is starting to change due to recent efforts in cost reduction, and due to staffing shortages. In practice, the term medical laboratory technician may apply to persons who are trained to operate equipment and perform tests, usually under the supervision of the certified medical technologist or laboratory scientist. Depending on the state where employment is granted, the job duties between MLSs and MLTs may or may not be similar. For example, in Florida, a MLT may only perform highly complex testing while under the direct supervision of a clinical laboratory technologist, a clinical laboratory supervisor, or a clinical laboratory director.Board of Clinical Laboratory Personnel This may make it impractical for a MLT to lawfully work in a Florida blood bank. California has similar restrictions on MLTs. To accommodate California's restrictions, the American Association of Bioanalysts (AAB) developed a separate certification examination for California licensure. However, this exam does not include material covering the areas of immunohematology or microscopy.https://www.aab.org/aab/California_CLS_and_MLT.asp ABOR Certification California Although the typical entry-level academic requirement for most MLTs is an associate degree, a 60 credit certificate program exists through military training programs; such as the U.S. Army's 68K military occupational specialty. As in other countries, staffing shortages have become a major issue in many clinical laboratories in the United States. Due to several factors, including boomer retirement, and inadequate recruitment and retention efforts, the medical laboratory workforce is shrinking. For the decade 2010‚Äì2020, workforce needs are expected to grow by 13%. This translates into about 11,300 positions per year that will need to be filled, with only about 5000 new graduates per year coming out of various programs. By 2025, it is estimated that the shortage of medical laboratory professionals will reach 98,700 in the U.S. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom (UK) there are two varieties of registered healthcare scientist in hospitals - Clinical Scientists and Biomedical Scientists (BMS). There is a strict and formal post graduate training programme for both careers followed by statutory registration for each with the Health & Care Professions Council UK (HCPC):[1], for the safety and assurance of the customers - the patients. They are two similar but distinct careers with parallel but different training paths and different entry requirements. The role of Clinical Scientists is to improve the health and well-being of patients and the public by practising alongside doctors, nurses, and other health and social care professionals in the delivery of healthcare. Their aim is to provide expert scientific and clinical advice to clinician colleagues, to aid in the diagnosis, treatment and management of patient care. Examples of the type of work they undertake include: * Advising, diagnosing, interpreting, and treating patients. * Advising health and social care professionals in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. * Researching the science, technology, and practise used in healthcare to innovate and improve services. * Designing, building, and operating technology for diagnosing and treating patients. * Ensuring the safety and reliability of tests and equipment used in healthcare. Trainee Clinical Scientist posts are advertised nationally, usually between November and February on the Clinical Scientists Recruitment webpages where application forms may be obtained and electronic submission of applications can be made. These posts are for the approved Pre-registration Training Programme, designed to prepare entrants for higher professional qualifications, further clinical training and eventual Consultant responsibility. Clinical Scientist training involves enrolment of graduates (1st or 2nd class honours degree or better is essential due to the high competition for limited training places) into an intensive 3-year training scheme leading to certification and eventual registration before starting the higher career structure. The basic qualification for becoming a Clinical Biochemist, Clinical Immunologist or Clinical Microbiologist is a good Honours degree in an appropriate subject: for Clinical Biochemistry, that subject might be Biochemistry or Chemistry (or another life science subject which contains a substantial Biochemistry component); for Clinical Immunology, that subject might be any life science degree with an immunology component; for Clinical Microbiology that subject might be any life science degree with a microbiology component. Although not essential, some candidates will apply with higher degrees in an attempt to improve their chances of selection for training and several universities currently offer MSc courses in Clinical Biochemistry, Immunology and Microbiology which have been approved by the ACB or the AHCS. Full-time and 'sandwich' courses are available, and further information may be obtained from individual programmes, although the level of financial support provided varies, and should be clarified at interview. Some entrants to the profession will already have obtained a PhD, and the training and research experience that this provides is invaluable to the work of the Clinical Scientist. In larger Departments, there may be opportunities to study for a research degree after entering the profession and acquiring registration, but since this has to be fitted in with other responsibilities, it may take some years to complete. It should be clearly understood that the major role of the profession is patient care and that research, management and all the other aspects will come as side issues and not be the predominating factor in the career path. The work of Biomedical Scientists and Clinical Scientists have impact on the diagnosis and treatment of almost every patient admitted to hospitals in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom is facing a shortage of qualified Clinical and Biomedical Scientists. The Royal College of Pathologists and the Royal College of Physicians have pointed out the need for increased government funding for medical training programs to prevent diagnostic facilities and medical infrastructure from being overwhelmed. Nigeria In Nigeria, Medical Laboratory Science is a high skilled profession charged by Act. 2004 Cap 114 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria. The initial qualification awarded graduates of the programme, like some other medical programmes, was Associate of the Institute of Medical Laboratory Technology/Science (AIMLT/AIMLS) The Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria, which was established by Act. 2004 Cap 114 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, regulates the practice of Medical Laboratory Science in Nigeria. In Nigeria, the Medical Laboratory Science programme is Bachelor of Medical Laboratory Science (BMLS), regulated by National Universities Commission (NUC) and by the Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria (MLSCN). Students at their first year (100 level) are trained under the Faculty of Science in Basic Sciences and Faculty of Arts, Management and Social science in General studies and Entrepreneurship. At the 200 level, students are taught basic medical sciences and are introduced to Medical Laboratory Science. The third year of the programme marks the beginning of the professional training as students are engaged in the classroom for lectures as well as in the Hospital laboratory for the professional or practical training. At the fourth year students are taught the basics in all the special areas of Medical Laboratory Science. At the end of 400 level programme, successful students are presented for the First professional examination, to be moderated by the Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria At the fifth year, students break into 4 core or specialized areas of Medical Laboratory Science, namely: medical microbiology/parasitology, chemical pathology/immunology, haematology/blood transfusion science and histopathology/cytopathology. At the end of the fifth year, suitable students are presented for final professional examination by the Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria. Certification and licensing cell count. United States There are currently three major certification agencies in the United States of America for clinical laboratory scientists. They are the American Association of Bioanalysts (AAB), the American Medical Technologists (AMT), and the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP). All three national accrediting agencies will certify scientists in the clinical laboratory as generalist (chemistry, hematology, immunology, immunohematology/blood bank, and microbiology). The American Association of Bioanalysts and the American Medical Technologists certifications continue to use the traditional designation Medical Technologist (MT), while the American Society for Clinical Pathology has adopted the designation of Medical Laboratory Scientist (MLS). Regardless of terminology, these highly qualified individuals serve as scientists in the clinical laboratory. There are two other organizations that have previously provided proficiency examinations to clinical laboratory scientist. The first, is the US Department of Health and Human Services. The second, is the National Credentialing Agency for Laboratory Personnel (NCA). The NCA was absorbed by the American Society for Clinical Pathology in 2009 and promptly dissolved. In the United States, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA '88) define the level of qualification required to perform tests of various complexity. Clinical Laboratory Scientists, Medical Technologists and Medical Laboratory Scientists are near the highest level of qualification among general testing personnel and are usually qualified to perform the most complex clinical testing including HLA testing (also known as tissue typing) and blood type reference testing. Provider Performed Microscopy, or PPM (doctorate or master's level health provider) and Cytology have additional requirements. In addition to the national certification, 12 states (California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Tennessee, West Virginia and New York) and Puerto Rico also require a state license. Puerto Rico, in order to provide the state license, requires either a local board certification with a state examination, or any of both the ASCP and the NCA. Minnesota, Texas, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Vermont, Washington, New Jersey, Iowa, Utah, Ohio, South Carolina, Wyoming, Pennsylvania, Virginia, South Dakota, Delaware, Missouri, and Alaska are currently attempting to obtain licensure. All states require documentation from a professional certification agency before issuing a state certification. A person applying for state certification may also be expected to submit fingerprints, education and training records, and competency certification. Some states also require completion of a specified number of continuing education contact hours prior to issuing or renewing a license. Licensing is somewhat controversial as it adds a bureaucratic layer in a field that is severely understaffed. Simply requiring testing personnel to obtain and maintain their national certification would help ensure competent testing personnel without increasing costs to testing personnel. Some states recognize another state's license if it is equal or more stringent, but currently California does not recognize any other state license. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom all clinical scientists and biomedical scientists have had to be registered with the Health & Care Professions Council (HCPC) in order to work unsupervised, to develop through the careers grades of their profession and to use the protected titles of \\"Clinical Scientist\\" or \\"Biomedical Scientist\\". The HCPC registers nearly 200,000 healthcare professionals[3] and while success in an approved degree course from an accredited University is sufficient for all other professions, both clinical scientists and biomedical scientists have post graduate training and no approved degree courses. Autonomous assessment of applicants in these two professions with subsequent certification for successful ones, is the only approved UK route to registration for them. \\"Clinical Scientist\\", just as \\"Biomedical Scientist\\", is a protected title under the law (there is a ¬£5000 fine for transgressors who fraudulently use the title without being registered by the state). The HCPC can strike people off the register for malpractice in just the same way as for doctors with the General Medical Council (GMC). Those who are working in \\"Trainee\\" positions in the profession are permitted to use the title with an appropriate caveat, for example ‚Äì \\"Pre-registration Clinical Scientist\\", Trainee Clinical Scientist, etc. Alternatively some may use titles specific to the discipline they train in, such as Trainee Clinical Biochemist\\", \\"Clinical Immunologist in Training\\" or ‚Äú Pre-Registrant Clinical Microbiologist‚Äù which is also perfectly acceptable since it is not implying the protected \\"Clinical Scientist\\" title of fully qualified and registered practitioners. It is against the law to formally work with the title of ‚ÄúClinical Scientist‚Äù without professional registration[4]. Nigeria In Nigeria successful student at the end of the training in both academic and professional assessments with respect to the graduation requirements is certified by the respective University, inducted and licensed by the Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria after a successful internship training. http://mlscn.gov.ng  Further education  As in many healthcare professions, a Medical Laboratory Scientist may pursue higher education to advance or further specialize in their career. *Master of Science, Master of Business Administration, Master of Health Administration, Doctor of medical laboratory science for specialization, education and management roles. *Doctor of Philosophy for management and directorship roles in the clinical laboratory as well as for academic research and professorship. Doctors of Philosophy holding a degree in a biological science, and who are board certified by a CLIA- approved entity, are qualified as a medical laboratory director. *Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of clinical laboratory Science - this is the position that qualifies an individual to oversee or direct almost all types of clinical laboratories. Under U.S. CLIA laws, a requirement of at least year of clinical laboratory experience (any MD) or pathology residency must be met. In the United Kingdom The Modernising Scientific Careers (MSC) programme sets out for the first time a comprehensive training and career framework for the whole healthcare science workforce inclusive of the more than 50 different scientific professional specialisms. In its conception it aimed to provide a coherent framework that was accessible, affordable and designed specifically to both capture scientific and technological advances and to provide improved outcomes for patients, the service and professionals. A key aspect of the framework from the start was the formalisation of training to develop talented clinical scientists to undertake quality assured Higher Specialist Scientist Training (HSST) programmes to prepare them for roles as Consultant Clinical Scientists. It is envisaged that Consultant Clinical Scientists will work synergistically and in partnership with their medical colleagues and within multiprofessional clinical teams to support clinical scientific practice aimed at quality improvement, innovation and world-class outcomes for patients. This scientific expertise and leadership will provide important benefits and added value to patients and to the service as it moves forward through the 21st century. This will bring to fruition the vision of science and realise the potential of scientific and technological advances for both translational and personalised medicine. Training through the Higher Specialist Scientist Training pathway is discipline specific. For life science disciplines (Immunology, Microbiology, Virology, Haematology, Biochemistry) the training curriculum and formal examinations are administered by the Royal College of Pathologists. The life science training pathway for Clinical Scientists follows a similar pathway to that undertaken by medically qualified specialist registrars in pathology. Clinical Scientists are therefore the only discipline of non-medical healthcare professionals examined by a Medical Royal College. Clinical Scientists who attain both part 1 examination certification and part 2 certification are awarded Fellowship of the Royal College of Pathologists (FRCPath) and are deemed to have the knowledge and expertise expected of a consultant level scientist. Consultant Clinical Scientist posts generally require candidates to have completed FRCPath qualification to be eligible. All Clinical Scientists regardless of seniority or specialisation may have other responsibilities including academic appointments, responsibilities as clinical lead for a pathology service, or may have wider hospital responsibilities such as Directorship of Infection Prevention and Control, or responsibility for the hospital's Research and Development strategy. Junior clinical scientists may become involved in academic research, working towards award of a Ph.D. or DClinSci Job title Russian MLS prepares the analyses in ELISA laboratory The informal abbreviations of job titles may be a source of confusion. In the United States Medical Laboratory Scientist (ASCP) and Medical Technologists (AMT) or (AAB) are often called \\"med techs\\" (based on the era in which they were known as \\"medical technologists\\"), but this shorthand term is shared by other healthcare employees, including pharmacy techs, radiographers (also known as radiologic technologists), and respiratory therapists. In the United States there is a formal distinction between an MLT and a MT/MLS. Often, MT/MLS have at least a bachelor's degree, while MLT have an associate degree. However, due to grandfathering rules and certification requirements between the boards of registry, some MT/MLS may only have an associate degree.https://www.aab.org/aab/MT.asp ABOR Certification Scientists and technologists generally earn a higher income than technicians, have more responsibilities, and have more opportunities for advancement. In the United Kingdom, there are defined training pathways leading to professional registration as either a Clinical Scientist, or as a Biomedical Scientist. The role descriptions for these healthcare scientists are very different, where clinical scientists generally undertake non-routine research and development, as well as improving and providing clinical service using scientific expertise. Biomedical Scientists in the United Kingdom are similar to the role of MLT and MT/CLS described above, and have similar regulatory requirements for professional regulation. Clinical Scientists in the United Kingdom may struggle with a lack of professional recognition. This is in part due to the myriad job titles used to describe them including Clinical Physiologists, Medical Physicists, and Clinical Biochemists, which generally mean the public and other healthcare workers assume Clinical Scientists to be medically qualified doctors, due to the sometimes complex nature of the role.

She revolutionized the modern practice of knitting through her books and instructional series on American public television. Though knitting back and forth on rigid straight needles was the norm, she advocated knitting in the round using flexible circular needles to produce seamless garments and to make it easier to knit intricate patterns. She also advocated the Continental knitting method, claiming that it is the most efficient and quickest way to knit. During World War II, German or continental knitting fell out of favor in the UK and US due to its association with Germany. Many English-language books on knitting are in the English or American style. Elizabeth Zimmermann helped to re-introduce continental style knitting to the United States. Early life Born Elizabeth Lloyd-Jones in the county of Devon, England, Zimmermann was the daughter of a British naval officer; her mother invented Meals by Motor, the British forerunner of Meals on Wheels. Zimmermann attended boarding school in England and art schools in Switzerland and Germany. Her autobiographical \\"Digressions\\" in the book Knitting Around reprinted many of her original artworks alongside the text. Zimmermann learned to knit first from her mother and aunts (English Style) and then later from her Swiss governess (German or Continental Style). Career=Business Zimmermann immigrated to the United States from England in 1937 with her new husband, German brewery master Arnold Zimmermann. The Zimmermanns initially settled in New York and eventually moved across country, finally settling in Wisconsin in a converted schoolhouse which would become home to Schoolhouse Press, a mail-order knitting business still based in the schoolhouse and run by her daughter Meg Swansen. Initiatives Zimmermann is credited with knitting the first example of an Aran sweater seen in an American magazine (Vogue Knitting). (While it may have been the first item knitted, another pattern had been published 2 years previously.) The pattern for which Zimmermann knitted the model was published in Vogue Pattern Book in 1958, while a collection of patterns for men's and women's Aran sweaters with matching socks and mittens, entitled \\"Hand Knits from the Aran Islands,\\" was published in a 1956 issue of Woman's Day. According to her posthumously published book The Opinionated Knitter, a yarn-company editor altered Zimmermann's circular knitting instructions for a Fair Isle Yoke pullover after she submitted the sweater, rendering it in the back-and-forth \\"flat\\" knitting method that was more popular among American knitters at the time. This alteration led Zimmermann to begin to publish her own instructions as Wool Gatherings. US television Zimmermann's PBS knitting series is still available on VHS and DVD. In one episode, a police officer (and friend of the family) pulled Zimmermann and her husband over for \\"knitting without a license.\\" (Always knitting, she'd even developed the ability to knit while on the back of her husband's motorcycle.) In The Opinionated Knitter, Zimmermann's daughter Meg notes that while her mother wanted to call her first book The Opinionated Knitter, her publishers changed it to Knitting Without Tears. However, the former perhaps best expresses Zimmermann's knitting philosophy. In all her published works (print and video), she encouraged knitters to experiment and develop their own patterns and ideas, letting their latent creativity unfold. Legacy=EPS Zimmermann devised her \\"EPS\\" (Elizabeth's Percentage System) calculation for sizing garments based on gauge and desired body circumference. Her \\"EPS\\" is still widely used by designers: it consists of a mathematical formula to determine how many stitches to cast on for a sweater, given that the sleeves and body are usually proportionate no matter what yarn or gauge is used. Original patterns Other patterns and techniques for which she is well known are the so-called \\"Pi Shawl,\\" a circular shawl that Zimmermann claimed was formed by regularly spaced increases based on Pi -- as she said in her book Knitter's Almanac, \\"The geometry of the circle hing[es] on the mysterious relationship of the circumference of a circle to its radius. A circle will double its circumference in infinitely themselves-doubling distances, or, in knitters' terms, the distance between the increase-rounds, in which you double the number of stitches, goes 3, 6, 12, 24 and so on.\\" The shawl is not, however, based on Pi in any special way, but only on the property common to all two- dimensional shapes in Euclidean geometry that all dimensions increase by the same factor at the same rate; the circular shape is simply created by regularly spacing the increases. Zimmermann is also known for the \\"i-cord\\" (or \\"idiot cord\\"), and the \\"Baby Surprise Jacket,\\" which is knitted completely flat and then folded, origami-style, to create a shaped jacket. She is also credited with introducing the Mobius scarf, a continuous one-sided cowl knit as a rectangular strip, then attached end to end by rotating one end 180 degrees. In 1974, Zimmermann founded a series of knitting camps that continue to this day under her daughter's direction. Her motto was: \\"Knit on with confidence and hope, through all crises.\\" Elizabeth Zimmermann died in Marshfield, Wisconsin, on 30 November 1999 at the age of 89. In her obituary, The New York Times wrote, \\"Mrs. Zimmermann chose to play down her influence on knitting, coining the term unventions for her woolly inventions.\\" A retrospective exhibit, \\"New School Knitting: The Influence of Elizabeth Zimmermann and Schoolhouse Press,\\" was presented at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Gallery of Design in 2006.

It is loosely adapted from The Kunlun Slave, a wuxia romance story written by Pei Xing in the ninth century during the Tang dynasty. Responses to the film were mainly mixed to negative. Plot Qingcheng, a starving girl, wanders around the land in search of food. She chances upon a boy, tricks him, steals a mantou from him, and runs away. She encounters the goddess Manshen and accepts an offer to enjoy a wealthy and luxurious life and become the most beautiful woman in the land. However, she has a price to pay: She will never find genuine everlasting love with any man. She becomes the King's concubine when she grows up. General Guangming defeats a large army of barbarians with only 1,000 soldiers and rushes back to save the King, who is besieged in the palace by the traitorous Duke Wuhuan. He meets Manshen, who tells him someone wearing his Crimson Armour will commit regicide and tarnish his reputation. A while later, Guangming is caught off guard and injured by Snow Wolf, Wuhuan's henchman, but is saved by his slave, Kunlun. He orders Kunlun to wear his crimson armour and save the King. When Kunlun asks his master how he can identify the King, Guangming tells him the King is the one without a weapon. Kunlun arrives at the palace and mistakes Qingcheng for the King because she is unarmed, and instead kills the King, who has just drawn his sword. He flees with Qingcheng, but they end up being cornered at a cliff by Wuhuan and his men. Wuhuan promises to not harm Qingcheng if Kunlun jumps off the cliff. Kunlun jumps off the cliff but survives the fall. In the meantime, Guangming's subordinates accuse their General of killing the King and turn against him. Kunlun returns, saves his master and gives him back his Crimson Armour. They go to rescue Qingcheng from Wuhuan later. Qingcheng falls in love with Guangming after mistaking him for the person who jumped off the cliff. On the other hand, Kunlun is captured by Wuhuan, who realises he is actually the one who killed the King. While Guangming and Qingcheng lead a happy life in the countryside, Kunlun uses his speed power to see the Veil of Time and learns that Wuhuan is responsible for the destruction of his family and homeland. Snow Wolf is actually from the same land as Kunlun and was forced to become Wuhuan's servant. Snow Wolf also tells Kunlun that no one is capable of crossing over to the other side of the Veil of Time. Wuhuan lures Guangming back to the palace and captures him. He then places Guangming, Kunlun, and Qingcheng on a show trial for regicide. During the trial, Kunlun confesses that he killed the King, and Qingcheng realises he is actually the one who saved her earlier. Guangming, Kunlun, and Qingcheng are sentenced to death but they break free and fight Wuhuan, who tells Qingcheng he is the boy she stole a mantou from. As a result of Qingcheng betraying his trust, Wuhuan grew up in hatred and became the evil person he is today. Both Wuhuan and Guangming die in the fight while Kunlun is fatally wounded. Kunlun survives after wearing Snow Wolf's immortality robe. Manshen appears when Kunlun and Qingcheng are attempting to pass through the Veil of Time, and tells Qingcheng that the promises made between deities and humans are as fragile as ordinary promises. Qingcheng has finally found her true love and thus given herself an opportunity to choose again. Manshen advises her to choose wisely. The film ends with the opening scene showing Qingcheng, as a little girl, wandering around. Cast * Jang Dong-gun as Kunlun * Hiroyuki Sanada as General Guangming * Cecilia Cheung as Qingcheng ** Guan Xiaotong as Qingcheng (young) * Nicholas Tse as Duke Wuhuan ** Shi Lei as Wuhuan (young) * Liu Ye as Snow Wolf * Chen Hong as Manshen Production The budget for The Promise was estimated to be about 282‚Äì340 million yuan (US$35‚Äì42 million), which surpassed the cost of Zhang Yimou's Hero (2002). Release The Promise was first released on 15 December 2005 in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. In North America, The Promise was originally scheduled to be released in December 2005 by The Weinstein Company (TWC) under the title Master of the Crimson Armor. TWC also removed approximately 25 minutes of footage from the original cut. However, TWC eventually cancelled the release and sold the film's distribution rights to Warner Independent Pictures (WIP). WIP retained the changes made by TWC, but reverted the film's title back to The Promise and released it on 5 May 2006 in 213 theatres. Reception=Critical reception The Promise received mixed reactions when it was first released in Asian countries. In China, most of the responses were mainly negative even though it grossed about US$9 million in the first week. Despite the negative reception, The Promise was one of two Chinese films in 2006 to be nominated for Golden Globes Best Foreign Language Film at the 63rd Golden Globe Awards. Box office The Promise grossed an estimated US$ 18 million in mainland China. It did not fare as well in Hong Kong, where it grossed only US$ 654,435 (HK$ 5,073,311). It grossed US$ 272,838 in its opening weekend in North America and collected US$ 669,625 by the end of its run. The Promise grossed a total of US$ 33,539,654 worldwide. Controversies The film was criticised for the environmental damage it caused while it was shooting in Yunnan. The film's production crew were accused of damaging the vegetation and natural scenery of the area and the surrounding Bigu Lake, and for leaving behind a large amount of undisposed household waste. Hu Ge's 2005 short film A Murder Case Caused by a Dumpling spoofed The Promise. After it was released on the internet, Chen Kaige threatened legal action for copyright infringement, but the case fizzled out due to widespread support for Hu from Chinese citizens.

Founded in 1908, the club currently compete in the . Based at Vicarage Field, Torrington have previously played in the Western League, South Western League and Devon and Exeter League, and rejoined the North Devon League in 2007. Known by the nicknames \\"Torrie\\" and \\"The Super Greens\\", Torrington have won a number of local honours, including one Western League Division One title, five North Devon League Premier Division titles and one North Devon League Senior Division title. They have also won a number of local cup tournaments, including the Combe Martin Cup, Arlington Cup and Torridge Cup. History=1908‚Äì1978: Early years and North Devon League Torrington Football Club was founded in 1908, and was originally known to be \\"a church side\\", with reverends playing for the club as late as 1914. The team quickly established themselves as consistent contenders in the Premier Division of the North Devon Football League (then called the Senior Division), winning the league title for the first time in the 1912‚Äì13 season, the penultimate season before the break during World War I. Note: User must manually select Torrington from the drop-down list. In the first season after the war, they were crowned champions for the second time, and also won the inaugural Hansen Cup thanks to a 1‚Äì0 win over Bideford. Torrington continued performing in the top-flight of the North Devon League for several decades. In the 1948‚Äì49 season, the club won their third North Devon League Senior Division title, and also broke a number of club records. One of these records was an 18‚Äì0 win over Ilfracombe Town, in which \\"scoring phenomenon\\" Sid Trickett is rumoured to have scored all 18 goals with headers. Ten years later, they were crowned Senior Division champions for a fourth time, and also won the Combe Martin Cup for the first time with a 2‚Äì0 victory over Appledore. The club also briefly played in the Devon and Exeter League, winning the Senior Division title in 1973 and the Premier Division title in 1974. 1978‚Äì2007: South Western and Western Leagues At the beginning of the 1978‚Äì79 season, Torrington made their first step up from the North Devon Football League to the South Western Football League. The team struggled in their first two seasons, finishing 17th and 15th out of 19 teams, but in both 1980‚Äì81 and 1982‚Äì83 they were crowned runners-up of the division, in both cases behind champions St Blazey. In the first of those two successful seasons, they also won the South Western League Cup. Torrington were elected to join the Western Football League for the 1984‚Äì85 season, beginning in Division One but achieving immediate promotion to the Premier Division after they finished second in the league, just one point behind champions Portway Bristol. In this season, the club also achieved their furthest progression in the FA Vase, reaching the fifth round of the tournament before being knocked out by Steyning Town. For their first few seasons in the Premier Division, Torrington struggled to move out of the bottom half of the league table, but in 1990‚Äì91 they finished second in the league. They remained in the Premier Division until 1998, usually finishing in the top eight, before finishing with just 14 points (18 fewer than 19th-placed Chard Town) to suffer relegation back to Division One. In 2002‚Äì03, the club won their first Western League Division One championship. 2007‚Äìpresent: Return to the North Devon League and promotion At the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season, despite a last-minute survival in the league due to results elsewhere, Torrington were forced to withdraw from the Western League due to financial difficulties, announcing on 20 June 2007 that they would be returning to the North Devon League alongside their reserve team. In their first season back in the North Devon League, the club won the Combe Martin Cup for the first time since 1959. They then defended the cup the following year, when they also won the Senior Division title for the first time.

Biography Born at Bologna to count Niccol√≤ Caprara, he was a descendant of generals Raimondo Montecuccoli and Ottavio Piccolomini. He served under Charles V, Duke of Lorraine during the Dutch War at the Battles of Sinsheim, Enzheim, and Mulhouse where he was subsequently captured. Later released, Caprara would relieve the siege at Offenburg in 1677, before the war's end the following year. In 1683, during the Great Turkish War, Caprara would again return to the service of Charles of Lorraine against the Turkish advance into Hungary soon winning distinction after the siege and capture of Neuhaeusel from 7 July to 17 August 1685. At the start of the Nine Years' War, Caprara was appointed commander-in-chief of Imperial forces in northern Italy where, in 1692, he was involved in the campaign to capture the Dauphin√©. Transferred to Hungary two years later, Caprara would remain commander-in-chief of Imperial forces in the region until his retirement in 1696, serving as vice president of the Imperial War Council until his death in February 1701.

Punk houses are similar to the hippie crash pads of the 1960s. The Factory, an alternative living space founded by Andy Warhol as the home base of The Velvet Underground, is directly linked to the formation of punk rock in New York City. In the early 1980s, a few punk gangs developed around allegiance to certain punk houses. Punk houses are often centered on certain political or personal ideologies. It is not uncommon for a punk house to be anarchist, strictly straight-edge, or vegan. A clique of punks may start a punk house by squatting an abandoned building, by renting, or by owning property. Punk houses are often communally inhabited in an attempt to minimize the individual expense of rent or property tax. Punk houses serve as backdrops for local scenes; punk houses often provide overnight shelter to touring punk rock bands, and sometimes serve as a venue for shows. Bands or record labels sometimes form in a particular punk house. Many punk houses have associated punk zines that sometimes share the name of the house. Groups of anarcho-punks run their houses as communes. Inhabitants sometimes identify their houses with unique names and symbols so they can represent their residence with clothing, slogans, and graffiti.

The screenplay is based on real life experiences of Time magazine reporter Alvin M. Josephy, Jr., who co-wrote the script. Plot Newspaper editor Jim Austin and his wife are fleeing Kennington, where they live and work, so that he may testify before a committee investigating how crime impacts commerce throughout the country. They are being pursued by the criminal element from their town and pull off the highway in a place called Warren, where they take refuge in a police station. Austin requests an escort to ensure they arrive safely at the committee location. He also gets permission to use the station's tape recorder, on which he chronicles the events which have brought him to this point. Austin is driven to investigate corruption after Clyde Nelson, a local private detective, working on an apparently harmless divorce case, discovers the existence of a big-time gambling syndicate operating with the consent of the city fathers, the local police, and the respectable elements of the community. Nelson is killed in a hit-and-run which appears to be an accident. Austin thinks otherwise and looks into the death.

The television broadcast of the hearings attracted huge public interest and educated a broad audience about the issues of municipal corruption and organized crime. The tremendous success of the broadcast led to the production of a whole cycle of \\"expos√©\\" crime films dealing with the dismantling of complex criminal organizations by law enforcement. The Captive City had the blessing of senator Kefauver himself: Robert Wise took a print of the film to Washington D. C. to show to senator Kefauver, who not only endorsed it but even appears in the prologue and epilogue, cautioning audiences about the evils of organized crime. Other notable examples of expos√© films include Hoodlum Empire (1952) and The Turning Point (1952).

Radetzkymarsch is an early example of a story that features the recurring participation of a historical figure, in this case the Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria (1830‚Äì1916). Roth continues his account of the Trotta family to the time of the Anschluss in his The Emperor's Tomb (Kapuzinergruft, 1938). The novel was published in English translation in 1933, and in a new, more literal, translation in 1995. Plot Radetzky March relates the stories of three generations of the Trotta family, professional Austro-Hungarian soldiers and career bureaucrats of Slovenian origin ‚Äî from their zenith during the empire to the nadir and breakup of that world during and after the First World War. In 1859, the Austrian Empire (1804‚Äì67) was fighting the Second War of Italian Independence (29 April ‚Äì 11 July 1859), against French and Italian belligerents: Napoleon III of France, the Emperor of the French, and the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia.A History of Austrian Literature 1918-2000, edited by Katrin Kohl and Ritchie Robertson. Rochester, N.Y.: Camden House, 2006, p. 67. The Emperor: Franz Joseph in Austrian Field Marshal uniform. In northern Italy, during the Battle of Solferino (24 June 1859), the well- intentioned, but blundering, Emperor Franz Joseph I, is almost killed. To thwart snipers, Infantry Lieutenant Trotta topples the Emperor from his horse. The Emperor awards Lt. Trotta the Order of Maria Theresa and ennobles him. Elevation to the nobility ultimately leads to the Trotta family's ruination, paralleling the imperial collapse of Austria-Hungary (1867‚Äì1918). Following his social elevation Lt. Trotta, now Baron Trotta, is regarded by his family ‚Äî including his father ‚Äî as a man of superior quality. Although he does not assume the airs of a social superior, everyone from the new baron's old life perceives him as a changed person, as a nobleman. The perceptions and expectations of society eventually compel his reluctant integration into the aristocracy, a class amongst whom he feels temperamentally uncomfortable. As a father, the first Baron Trotta is disgusted by the historical revisionism that the national school system is teaching his son's generation. The school history textbook presents as fact a legend about his battlefield rescue of the Emperor. He finds especially galling the misrepresentation that infantry lieutenant Trotta was a cavalry officer. The Baron appeals to the Emperor to have the school book corrected. The Emperor considers however that such a truth would yield an uninspiring, pedestrian history, useless to Austro- Hungarian patriotism. Therefore, whether or not history textbooks report Infantry Lt. Trotta's battlefield heroism as legend or as fact, he orders the story deleted from the official history of Austria-Hungary. The subsequent Trotta family generations misunderstand the elder generation's reverence for the legend of Lt. Trotta's saving the life of the Emperor and consider themselves to be rightful aristocrats. The disillusioned Baron Trotta opposes his son's aspirations to a military career, insisting he prepare to become a government official, the second most respected career in the Austrian Empire; by custom, the son was expected to obey. The son eventually becomes a district administrator in a Moravian town. As a father, the second Baron Trotta (still ignorant of why his war-hero father thwarted his military ambitions) sends his own son to become a cavalry officer; grandfather's legend determines grandson's life. The cavalry officer's career of the third Baron Trotta comprises postings throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire and a dissipated life of wine, women, song, gambling, and dueling, off-duty pursuits characteristic of the military officer class in peace-time. Following a fatal duel the young Trotta transfers from the socially elite Uhlans to a less prestigious J√§ger regiment. Baron Trotta's infantry unit then suppresses an industrial strike in a garrison town. Awareness of the aftermath of his professional brutality begins Lieutenant Trotta's disillusionment with empire. He is killed, bravely but pointlessly, in a minor skirmish with Russian troops during the opening days of World War I. His lonely and grieving father, the District Commissioner, dies almost immediately after Franz Joseph two years later. Two mourners at the funeral conclude that the second von Trotta could not have survived the old Emperor, and that neither could have survived the dying Empire. Literary significance The novel's namesake, Josef Graf Radetzky von Radetz. Radetzky March is Joseph Roth's best-known work. It was critically acclaimed after being first published in German in 1932 and then translated to English in 1933.Jonh Chamberlain. Books of The Times: Radetzky March, The New York Times, October 17, 1933. In 2003, the German literary critic Marcel Reich-Ranicki included it in Der Kanon (\\"The Canon\\") of the most important German-language literary novels. It is a novel of the ironies and humour inherent in the well-intentioned actions that led to the decline and fall of a family and an empire; the Emperor Franz Josef I of Austria-Hungary remains ignorant of the unintended, negative consequences of so rewarding his subjects, and he continues conferring great favors, as with Lt. Trotta, after the Battle of Solferino in 1859. Composer Johann Strauss I, ca. 1837. The novel's title derives from the Radetzky March, Op. 228 (1848), by Johann Strauss Sr. (1804‚Äì49), which honors the Austrian Field Marshal Joseph Radetzky von Radetz (1766‚Äì1858). It is a symbolic musical composition heard at critical narrative junctures of the Trotta family history. During an interview on the United States TV show Charlie Rose, Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa ranked The Radetzky March as the best political novel ever written.Mario Vargas Llosa interview by Charlie Rose When time passed, the multi-generation family saga Radetzky March brought its author an acclaim and recognition as \\"one of the greatest German-language writers of the 20th century.\\"Larry Rohter.

It was one of the over 300 different types of digital game controllers produced in the 1980s and 1990s. It has two smaller siblings, the Slik Stik and StarFighter which are built in a similar fashion. The joystick square base came in two colors, black or creme. Features: * One 8-way stick (4 digital switches) * Two fire buttons (both linked to button 1) Technical features: * TAC-2 has no microswitches, using instead a metal ball that short-circuited contacts around the bottom shaft of the controller. * The fire buttons in the original version work with brass contact plates which tend to become oxidized and thus need care every now and then. * 9-pin Atari style connector (DB-9 connector) * Handle is a customized tire valve (TR-418) with a chrome sleeve which gives the TAC-2 its special characteristics. A cost reduced version was released where the tyre valve was skipped and instead a white rubber gasket held a black plastic tube, the shafted metal ball inside was simply plugged into it (not screwed as the original version) and the brass plates in the buttons where replaced with the wire of the redesigned button return spring, it is mainly recognized by its shiny plastic stick instead of the chrome valve sleeve and deeper red buttons instead of the original orange. Founding, Startup and Merger: Suncom, manufacturer of Tac-2 was incorporated in Illinois on 12 May 1982 (Illinois Corporation File Number 52729777) by its founder, Howard Leventhal (Born 1956). Thomas F. Quinn (1935-2004) a former executive from retailer Sears Roebuck, later became president of the company after Burton A. Slotky (1936-2014), a successful billiard table manufacturer provided investment capital. Quinn had been the buyer at Sears when a young Nolan Bushnell, founder of Atari, the original home video game maker, had no major customers and needed one. By placing an order with Atari and advancing millions of Sears dollars for manufacturing the order, Tom Quinn provided the financial spark that ignited the entire computer gaming industry. Suncom was merged with its direct competitor Wico, also a Chicago area company in 1989 and later became a division of RCA Corp.

An investigation concluded that the aircraft, a Vickers Viscount 745D turboprop airliner, had struck at least two whistling swans, which caused severe damage to the plane, resulting in a loss of control. The accident resulted in a greater understanding of the amount of damage that can be caused by bird strikes during flight. As a result, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued new safety regulations that required newly certified aircraft to be able to better withstand in-flight impacts with birds without affecting the aircraft's ability to fly or land safely. Accident The flight, flying as United Airlines Flight 297, was a scheduled passenger flight from Newark to Atlanta, with stops at Washington National Airport, Raleigh‚ÄìDurham Airport, and Charlotte Municipal Airport. It had 13 passengers and 4 crew members on board. The first leg of the flight was scheduled to last one hour at a true airspeed of . The plane departed Newark at 11:39 a.m. local time and proceeded normally until 12:14 p.m., when it was cleared to descend from 10,000 to 6,000 feet. At 12:19 p.m., air traffic controllers advised the flight that they had received numerous reports of large numbers of ducks and geese in the area, and the pilots acknowledged the report. At 12:22 p.m., Washington Approach directed the flight to turn left to a heading of 200 degrees, which was also confirmed by the pilots. An additional course change was transmitted at 12:23 p.m., but was not acknowledged. At 12:24 p.m., controllers lost radar contact with the plane. The aircraft struck two whistling swans with its stabilizers at 6,000 feet. One of the birds caused only superficial damage to the right stabilizer, approximately one foot long and an eighth of an inch deep, while the other crashed completely through the left stabilizer and came out the other side. The impact caused the stabilizer to separate from the plane; it was found a quarter of a mile from the main wreckage. Investigators estimated that the crash might not have occurred if the two birds had hit the aircraft just a few inches higher or lower. The plane lost control, and in less than a minute, the aircraft's altitude dropped from approximately 6,000 feet to ground level, and its airspeed increased from indicated airspeed. The plane crashed southwest of Baltimore and exploded, killing all of the occupants. Aircraft The aircraft was a Vickers Viscount 745D, a British medium-range turboprop airliner, serial number 128. It was registered as tail number N7430 and manufactured on June 30, 1956. At the time of the crash, it had a total of 18,809 logged flight hours. It was powered by four Rolls-Royce Dart 510 turboprop engines. United Airlines acquired the plane from Capital Airlines when the two companies merged in 1961. It was one of 60 built, and had a capacity of 48 passengers. Passengers and crew The pilot of the plane was Milton Balog, of Pennsylvania, who was 39 years old. He had served as a pilot in the United States Army Air Corps flying a bomber in the European theater of World War II and had received the Distinguished Flying Cross. After the war, he took a job with Capital Airlines. The copilot was Robert Lewis, who was 32 years old. He held an airline transport pilot licence that had lapsed because he was overdue for a physical, but he was qualified and licensed to fly as a copilot with his commercial pilot license. Crew member Mary Key Klein had completed her company training and started work on June 21, 1962, and crew member Karen G. Brent had started work for the airline on August 16, 1962. Of the thirteen passengers aboard the plane, six were off- duty employees of United Airlines. Investigation Diagram of damage observed on the left stabilizer After the accident, a team of ten investigators from Washington arrived, headed by George A. Van Epps, the chief of safety investigation for the Civil Aeronautics Board. The wreckage from the plane was spread over an area of in diameter, with the largest piece of debris only long. A severe ground fire that broke out after the crash consumed most of the fuselage, right wing, and part of the left wing. The fire removed potential evidence of additional bird strikes that may have occurred on other parts of the aircraft, but the investigators were able to recover the flight recorder. Investigators reassembled critical parts of the aircraft at Washington National Airport, where they concluded that the aircraft had struck at least two birds. A partial bird carcass as well as feathers, tissue, and blood was found from the separated section of the left stabilizer and was identified by the Chief Medical Examiner for the State of Maryland to be of bird origin. Specimens of feathers and bones found at the site were taken to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, who identified them as belonging to whistling swans, birds that can attain weights in excess of . A pilot in the vicinity of the flight had reported seeing a flock of approximately fifty very large white birds flying in a trail at approximately 5,500 feet. Other pilots in the area also said that air traffic controllers at Washington Center had reported radar contacts near them that the pilots identified as large flocks of birds. The Civil Aeronautics Board released a final report of their investigation on March 22, 1963. The investigators concluded that the probable cause of the accident was \\"a loss of control following separation of the left horizontal stabilizer which had been weakened by a collision with a whistling swan.\\" The board recommended that additional research be undertaken to determine the risks to modern aircraft from bird strikes and to learn how to increase safety of aircraft in the event of bird strikes. Legacy Front view of the Viscount, showing how the critical surfaces of the empennage are outside of the area shielded by the propellers Before the accident, aircraft had been designed with the understanding that critical control services of the aircraft were protected from bird strikes by the wings and the propellers of the aircraft. The design of the Viscount 745D created new vulnerabilities because the tailplane was mounted higher than the top of the propeller discs, and therefore was unprotected. The higher cruising speeds of newer aircraft also increased the amount of damage that could be caused by a bird, but nearly all of the prior research on the dangers of bird strikes had been conducted in the 1930s. The only airworthiness regulation that had been in effect about bird strike safety was Civil Air Regulations (CAR) 4b, which required the windshield of an aircraft to be able to withstand an impact from a bird at cruising speed. As a result of the accident, the FAA reviewed data from other bird strike incidents and performed bird strike testing on several types of jet aircraft. The investigators concluded that most types of aircraft were inherently bird resistant, but a few types, including the type that crashed, were vulnerable in the empennage area. In 1968, the FAA proposed the addition of a rule requiring airplanes to be capable of safe flight and landing after an impact on the empennage by an bird at cruising speed. The agency received a number of comments, some suggesting that the eight-pound bird limit was insufficient, and would not have prevented the crash of United Airlines Flight 297, others suggesting that the wings of aircraft were also vulnerable, not just the tail section. On May 8, 1970, section 25.631 \\"Bird strike damage\\" of the Code of Federal Regulations took effect. This regulation added a requirement that the empennage structure of an aircraft must be designed to assure the capability of continued safe flight and landing after an impact with an eight-pound bird during flight at the likely operational speeds. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Joint Aviation Authorities was formed to produce the Joint Aviation Requirements for certification of large aircraft in Europe. The Joint Aviation Requirements were largely based upon Section 25 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations. The regulations implemented in section 25.631 specified that the entire aircraft, not just the empennage, had to be designed to withstand a bird strike, but instead of an eight-pound bird, it specified only a four-pound bird.

She is best known for her 1982 UK top-10 hit single \\"Just What I Always Wanted\\" and her 1960s image complete with beehive hairstyle. Career Recording on the Compact Records label with her backing band The Wilsations, Wilson scored six UK Top 100 singles between 1982-84. Her biggest hit \\"Just What I Always Wanted\\" reached number 8 in 1982. In 1983, she scored a second Top 40 hit with a cover of \\"Cry Me a River\\" (UK #27) and released her debut album Showpeople (UK #24). After this, further commercial success eluded her, though in 1985 she recorded the song \\"Would You Dance with a Stranger\\" (theme for the film Dance with a Stranger) and turned her career towards live performances. She subsequently distanced herself from her beehive days, but started touring with her old songs again in 2007. In 1992, her album The Rhythm Romance, which combined jazz standards with 1960s songs and original material, failed to return her to the charts. She continued performing with jazz bands, and she sang the theme song to the TV sitcom Coupling (\\"Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps\\"). Her version of \\"Cry Me a River\\" was featured in the 1990s crime drama series McCallum. In 2005, she returned to recording with the album Dolled Up. This was followed by a compilation of her hits, The Platinum Collection, to celebrate her 25th anniversary in the music industry. Apart from pursuing her solo career, she toured with Barb Jungr and Claire Martin as the cabaret act 'Girl Talk' (though Claire Martin has now been replaced by Gwyneth Herbert).Profile , GirlTalkdivas.co.uk; accessed 6 August 2015.

While not of great significance in terms of its length (about ), it is one of Gwynedd's primary rivers, and has greatly influenced the landscape in which it flows. It has its source in Glaslyn, a cirque lake on the flanks of Snowdon. It is joined by Nant Traswnant which drains Pen-y- Pass and by Nant Cynnyd before entering the beautiful lake, Llyn Gwynant. The river then flows through Llyn Dinas before entering the village of Beddgelert. In the middle of the village it is joined by the substantial tributary, the River Colwyn which drains the south western flank of Snowdon. The much enlarged river flows down past Gelert's grave before tumbling down into the Aberglaslyn Pass. This is a small rocky gorge close to the main road which provides easy public access to a most picturesque piece of Snowdonian scenery. Passing through Pont Aberglaslyn, the river emerges from the gorge into the relatively flat agricultural land of Tremadog and Porthmadog. This wide flat valleynow called Traeth Mawrwas once the estuary of the Glaslyn before the Porthmadog Cob was created. This sealed off the mouth of the estuary enabling the land to be reclaimed. Once the river has crossed under the railway line, it meanders in large pools and marshes before eventually passing through the tidal sluices on the Cob at the south-eastern end of the town of Porthmadog, and from there into Tremadog Bay. Further south, the River Dwyryd also drains into Tremadog Bay. The first pair of breeding ospreys in Wales nest at Pont Croesor about upstream from Porthmadog where the RSPB have set up observation facilities. They first bred in 2005 and have returned every year since. Fishing on the Glaslyn up to Beddgelert is controlled by the Glaslyn Angling Association.

In terms of its composition, this star shows a similar abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium to the Sun. The envelope of this star is undergoing oscillations that show up as changes in the star's radial velocity. Over long durations these follow a linear trend, in combination with shorter period oscillations occurring over a few days. These oscillations are unlikely to be the result of rotational module as that would imply a high rotation rate, which would display itself through strong X-ray emissions.

PREPAK was formed under the leadership of R. K. Tulachandra in 1977. History PREPAK was formed, in a meeting held on Cheirouching, Imphal, on 9 October 1977. The meeting was attended by R.K. Tulachandra, S. Wanglen, Achamba, Tajila, Meiraba, Meipaksana, Y. Ibohanbi and Paliba, (who were the founding members of PREPAK). After its formation, it launched a series of attacks and ambushes against Manipur Police and Manipur Rifles personnel during the late seventies and early eighties. In 1980, a small group split off from PREPAK and formed the Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP) led by its late leader Y. Ibahanbi. The founding leader, RK Tulachandra, was killed in an encounter in Kabowakching on 12 November 1985 . After his death, S. Wanglen became the Commander-in-Chief of the group. In the late eighties, the group suffered its first factionalism as it split into many small groups. Some of these groups joined other insurgent groups of the state like PLA and United National Liberation Front (UNLF). The late leader of the group, Urikhingbam Sarat alias Meiraba, with the help of the UNLF and PLA, played a crucial role in reuniting the group. After unification, PREPAK, along with PLA/RPF and UNLF, launched a social reformation campaign in the state of Manipur. The campaign was aimed at eradicating crimes against women, drug and alcohol addictions etc. The group's General Secretary L. Masunga was killed on 19 May 1993. After the death of L. Masunga, Subash alias Paliba was elected as the General Secretary, Achamba as Chairman, Naba as Vice-Chairman, Tajila as Commander-in-chief, Chinglemba Mangang as the Defence Secretary. However, Achamba was removed from Chairmanship soon after. In the early 2000s, the group again split into two factions - one headed by its General secretary, the other by the Vice- Chairman. Efforts were made by the UNLF, PLA/RPF, KYKL and KCP to reunite the two factions. Many cadres of both factions lost their lives in factional clashes. In, 2006/2007, both the factions of PREPAK were re-united. However, another faction led by Defence Secretary Chinglemba Mangang of the General Secretary faction split off to form the United People's Party of Kangleipak (UPPK). Political ideologyOrganisational setupArea of operation As the cadres are drawn from the Meitei people who are predominantly Vaishnavites and the Pangal people who are Sunni, the group operates mainly in the Imphal valley.

These are collected short stories. The stories explain how things supposedly came to be. Plot ‚ÄúThe Butterfly that Stamped‚Äù is one of the stories that is about King Solomon, his lovely wife Balkis (she is the one he is in love with, and she loves him, in most versions the others are there just because he is king and has to have more wives than anyone else), his other nine-hundred ninety nine wives, and two charming but quarrelsome butterflies. Solomon (who mainly goes by Suleiman bin Daoud in the story) is a very wise man, but is very annoyed with his surplus wives and all their quarreling. He thinks they are very loud and ungrateful. He refuses to use his magic to do anything about it because he believes it is just showing off, something he swore to refrain from doing after an embarrassing moment when he provided a feast for all life only for it to be devoured by a sea monster. One day, when walking in his forest, Suleiman bin Daoud stumbles upon two butterflies arguing. The male butterfly tells his wife he could stamp his foot and the huge palace garden would disappear in a bid to control her because she is quarreling with him, and as he tells the king you know how women are. Suleiman bin Daoud finds the claim amusing and calls the butterfly over. After asking the butterfly why he lied, he tells the butterfly that if he has to, he will help him. Meanwhile, Balkis has a talk with the butterfly‚Äôs wife, who says she is only pretending to agree with him, because \\"you know how men are.\\" Balkis tells her she should dare her husband to stamp his foot, as he must be lying, and then she can argue with him again. Really, she is hoping the disappearance of the palace will shock the other wives into obedience. The female butterfly dares her husband, and the butterfly prevaricates by telling her the king called him over to ask him not to, because he is afraid of the butterfly. The wife insists he stamps, and he goes to the king, who tells him he will make it happen to help control his wife, sympathizing with the butterfly's plight. The butterfly stamps and the palace disappears. This makes the butterfly's wife scared, and she promises never to argue with him again as long as he brings it back, leaving Solomon in fits of laughter. But when the garden vanishes, Solomon's quarrelling wives are deathly afraid, believing that the king is dead and the heavens are mourning the news. Balkis claims it was the butterfly who was angry at his wife, and they realise that if the king will do this for the sake of a tiny butterfly, what will he do to us, we who have been making him miserable with our quarreling, and they in turn become scared of Solomon's powers, and are nice and quiet from then on. Balkis then explains to Solomon what had happened, and how it was all for his benefit, for if he will do all this for the sake of a butterfly, it cannot be wrong to help himself occasionally, and they return to the palace.

In 1931 King's College, Cambridge sold their final plots of land to the council, having been owners of much of the land in the manor of Ruislip since the mid-15th century. The urban district was abolished in 1965 and its former area was incorporated into the newly established London Borough of Hillingdon, as part of Greater London. History=Creation The urban district was created on 30 September 1904, covering the parish of Ruislip, which had previously been part of Uxbridge Rural District. The parish of Ruislip included Ruislip Manor, South Ruislip, Eastcote, and Northwood. The new urban district council held its first meeting at Northwood School on 1 October, the day after the district's formation.Bowlt 1994, p.90 An urban district council had been considered a year previously, in light of the expansion of areas within the parish, particularly Northwood. A report was prepared in 1903 which noted the population in Northwood‚Äî2,700 by that time, with 530 houses‚Äîcompared with the largely rural character of the rest of Ruislip parish. The Metropolitan Railway extension from Harrow to Uxbridge was also discussed at the meeting on 28 October 1903, as a station was to be opened in Ruislip on the line. Kings College, Cambridge, owners of much of the land in the parish, were planning to sell some for development in light of the new line. As a result of these events, the Ruislip Parish Council voted in favour of becoming an urban district. Governance and developments The urban district council consisted of nine councillors in 1904: the Chairman William Page Edwards; F. M. Elgood; H. J. Brewer; H. Ewer; William Gregory; S. Matheson; Rev. Harvey Roe; J. Westacott, and A. M. Hooper. A clerk was appointed, E. R. Abbot, for ¬£100 per year. He remained in the position until 1931. By 1920 the number of councillors had reached 15. The expansion of the Metropolitan Railway caused the district to experience a sharp rise in population‚Äîfrom 6,217 in 1911 to 72,791 in 1961‚Äîand an increase in suburban house-building, especially in the area termed Metro-land. Consequentially, the district was one of the first in England to devise a statutory planning scheme in 1914, following the Housing and Town Planning Act 1909.Delafons 1997, p.93 The council had been prompted to follow this new act by the Chairman of the Council, Mr. Elgood, an architect, and the Clerk to the Council, Mr. Abbot. Members of the council had already raised concerns over some of the new building work around Eastcote and South Ruislip and the new development near Northwood station, which they described as \\"badly arranged and packed\\".Bowlt 1994, p.93 Three divisions were established within the new council: Finance and General Purposes; Public Health, Buildings and Sewerage; and Highways. The council sought to save money from the outset; reducing the number of workmen employed on the highways from ten to seven and cancelling the cleaning of ditches beside the roads. The lowest-paid man working on the sewers was informed he would need to move within the district and take a pay cut from ¬£1:6s to ¬£1:3s or be made redundant. He accepted. The urban district council worked with King's College to establish plots of land for development around Ruislip and Ruislip Manor. A town planning competition was held, won by A & J Soutar, town planners from Wandsworth, who sought to create a symmetrical design spreading across Ruislip parish. Many of the woods and historic sites including Manor Farm were to be demolished and cleared as part of the plan, making way for a projected total of 7,642 homes, enough for 35,000 residents. Only the church in Ruislip, St. Martin's, would have been spared. An outline map was made public on 30 November 1910 with few objections. A local board inquiry followed on 17 February 1911, which required negotiations with landowners to allow for a full planning scheme to be compiled. This was presented in February 1913 with an adaptation of the original Soutars plan and received approval from the Local Government Board in September 1914.Bowlt 1994, p.96 Three roads with residential housing‚ÄîManor Way, Windmill Way, and Park Way‚Äîwere completed before the outbreak of the First World War. All construction work was halted, and did not resume until 1919. The Ruislip Manor Cottage Society had been set up in 1911 to facilitate the construction of cottages and small housing in the area, though it did not manage to build as much as had been planned. As the council took on several plots in Eastcote, only four houses could be built by the society there. In Northwood, eighteen cottages were later built in 1926.Bowlt 1994, p.100 Development after the First World War The remains of an ancient motte-and-bailey castle in Manor Farm Manor Farm and the local woods were eventually saved from new developments in January 1930, after a member of the Royal Society of Arts visited to choose the buildings that should be conserved. The Great Barn and Little Barn were singled out, together with the old Post Office, the Old Bell public house, and the Priest's House of the local church. The woods were included in a sale by King's College to the district in February 1931. Park Wood was sold for ¬£27,300, with Manor Farm and the old Post Office included as a gift to the people of Ruislip. King's had wished to also present the wood as a gift but was required by the University and College's Act to receive payment, as it was the trustee of the land. Middlesex County Council contributed 75 per cent of the cost, as the urban district council argued that many of those who would make use of the land would be recreational day-trippers from outside the district. Under a 999-year lease, the council agreed to maintain the wood and ensure no new building was constructed without the permission of the county council. An area of the wood to the south was not included in the lease agreement and three residential roads were later constructed on it.Bowlt 1994, p.115 Copse Wood was purchased by Middlesex County Council and London County Council in 1936 for ¬£23,250, joined by Mad Bess Wood in the same year. The urban district council purchased the wood together with Middlesex and London County Councils for ¬£28,000 in a compulsory purchase from Sir Howard Stransom Button.Bowlt 1994, p.119 Sir Howard became High Sheriff of Middlesex in 1937. The council purchased Haydon Hall and its of ground in 1936, planning to build a civic centre there. The outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 caused the plan to be suspended, and it was never continued.Bowlt 1994, p.35 During the war, the urban district saw a high number of bombing raids by the Luftwaffe during The Blitz, between 8 September 1940 and 9 May 1941. A total of 57 raids were recorded with 241 high explosive bombs, 2000 incendiary bombs and 4 parachuted landmines falling on the area; 27 people were killed and a further 231 were injured.Edwards 1987, p.69 A public hall was built on part of the Manor Farm site in 1965 and named Winston Churchill Hall. The land upon which it was built had been Barn Close and was bought by Councillor T. R. Parker in 1932 from King's College. He presented the land to the Ruislip Village Trust as the site of a future public hall and the Trust gave it to the urban district council in 1964 stipulating that that would be the sole use. Abolition The urban district was abolished in 1965 and its area formed part of the London Borough of Hillingdon in Greater London. By this time the population within the district had reached 75,000. The Ruislip-Northwood name survived in the Ruislip-Northwood parliamentary constituency until 2010, when it was incorporated into the Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner constituency. Coat of arms A coat of arms was granted in 1937. It is described as \\"argent, a hurst of oak-trees proper growing out of a grassy mount, and above them a roundel azure charged with a star of five points or; on a chief gules a silver mitre between two fleurs-de- lis or\\". It also had a crest, described as \\"on a wreath or the colours in front of two ears of rye slipped in saltire proper a boar passant sable armed and unguled.\\" The hurst of trees with a representation of the Pole Star above are a play on the name Northwood. The mitre and fleurs-de-lys refer to the Abbey of Bec Herlewin in Normandy, to whom the Lordship of Ruislip was granted, where there was a cell of the Order. The Manor was later seized by Henry V and granted as part of the endowment of King's College, Cambridge. The Abbey and the College were dedicated to St. Mary, one of whose symbols is a fleur-de-lis. The 'rye slips' are a play on the name Ruislip. The wild boar shows that the Lordship was an ancient one, granted when the land was forest roamed by wild boars. The present coat of arms of the London Borough of Hillingdon use the Pole Star, fleur-de-lis, and rye stalks from the coat of arms of the former Ruislip-Northwood Urban District on its coat of arms.

The 1955 elections were historic for Sinn F√©in as it was the first time that the party had contested all constituencies in Northern Ireland since 1921, and the first time since 1918 that any Sinn F√©in candidates had been elected for Northern Ireland constituencies in the British House of Commons.

He accompanied Giuliano della Rovere to France in 1494, and continued in favor when Della Rovere was elected pope, becoming Pope Julius II. Alidosi was elected as bishop of Mileto in 1504, and then transferred to the see of Pavia on 26 March 1505. He occupied the seat until his death in 1511. Early life Born at Castel del Rio, he was the third son of Giovanni Alidosi, lord of Castel del Rio. He went to France with Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, the future Pope Julius II, in 1494. When Della Rovere was elected pope in 1503, Alidosi became his secretary and main collaborator, and was appointed papal chamberlain, then treasurer. Cardinal-priest Portrait by Raphael Though many cardinals opposed the promotion, in 1505 Alidosi was created cardinal-priest of Santi Nereo e Achilleo, opting for the title of S. Cecilia on 11 August 1506. He served as intermediary between Michelangelo Buonarroti and Pope Julius II and, in 1506, signed on behalf of the pope the contract for the ceiling frescoes of the Sistine Chapel, later doing the same for the statue of the Pope in Bologna. He also served as Cardinal protector of England within the college. He was a protector of Desiderius Erasmus and patron of the arts. Julius II placed great confidence in him, finding him to be an energetic and shrewd collaborator in his political plans. On 22 September 1508 the cardinal went to Viterbo to visit the Pope, who gave the legation in Bologna to Cardinal Ippolito d'Este of Ferrara. The following November, the pope recalled Cardinal Alidosi from the legation. After taking possession of the legation in Bologna on 27 June 1508, he ordered Alberto Castelli, Innocenzo Ringhieri, Sallustio Guidotti and Bartolomeo Magnani to be strangled. They were accused of \\"having supported a conspiracy to favor the Bentivoglio\\", and for having worked with the Venetians against the pope. More than thirty other persons, supporters of the Bentivoglio, were also executed. These actions unleashed a great indignation among the Bolognese. Named legate in Romagna and Marche in early 1509, he took possession of Ravenna on 29 May 1509 and left his brother Obizzo as governor. He was sent as envoy to the king of France and arrived on 19 June 1509, together with Cardinal Fran√ßois Guillaume de Castelnau-Clermont-Lud√®ve at Mantua. The king of France nominated him as bishop of Cremona without papal approval. On 4 January 1510 the cardinal was recalled to Rome in order to answer to Pope Julius II about the complaints of the Bolognese. Some theorize the pope recalled Cardinal Alidosi in order to make use of his experience to negotiate peace with Venice. An agreement was reached on 24 February 1510. After that the Pope was forced to take a more accommodating attitude towards King Louis XII of France, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I and the Duke of Ferrara to ensure the independence of the Catholic Church and the freedom of Italy from foreigners. Accusation of treason In April 1510, many Bolognese notables were shocked to learn the pope returned the legation of Bologna to Cardinal Alidosi. They suspected him of dealing with the French during the fight against Venice. On 7 October 1510, while at the papal field near Modena, Francesco Maria I della Rovere, Duke of Urbino, had the cardinal captured, handcuffed and led back to Bologna escorted by 150 horsemen. Outside the San Felice gate, twelve balestrieri removed the handcuffs and led him to a public square. Here he was accused of high treason. The Duke of Urbino and citizens of Bologna were hoping he would be punished. Instead, the pope allowed him to defend himself, and, finding the accusations unjustified, ruled in his favor. Cardinal Alidosi was named apostolic administrator of the see of Bologna on 18 October 1510, a post which he occupied until his death. On 28 October 1510, Cardinal Alidosi was again taken prisoner by the Duke of Urbino for treason. The pope soon had him freed again and reinstated his honors. On 14 May 1511, the pope moved his residence from Bologna to Ravenna for security reasons, lodging in the Benedictine monastery of San Vitale. The supporters of the Bentivoglio and those who opposed the power of the church revolted immediately. At about 10 p.m. on 20 May, a disguised Cardinal Alidosi escaped to Castel del Rio, taking all of value that he could carry. This action prompted Francesco Maria della Rovere, at the gates of the city, to abandon the field, along with all the artillery, nearly all the provisions, and numerous flags. On 23 May Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, head of the French army, entered Bologna with the Bentivoglio. The pope notified the cardinals of the loss of the city, and charged the duke of Urbino and the citizens of treason. He asked the duke to be executed, but Francesco Maria responded by charging Alidosi with treason. From Castel del Rio, the cardinal went to Ravenna to give his version. He was accompanied by his brother-in-law, Guido Vaini, and a legatine guard of 100 horsemen. Pope Julius II determined that the traitor had been the duke of Urbino. Death On 24 May 1511 the duke had an audience with the Pope. He was reproached sourly, and exited with eight of his faithfuls. He went to the lodgings of Cardinal Alidosi, who was staying with Cardinal Marco Vigero, near the church of San Vitale in Ravenna. At the same time, the cardinal, accompanied by his guard, was heading out for the apartments of the Pope, who had invited him to supper. The cardinal saluted the Duke, and a youngster in the Duke's retinue dismounted his horse angrily and advanced towards the cardinal. Taking the bridle of the mule that the cardinal was riding, he stabbed the cardinal in the side. The cardinal fell off the mule, and once on the ground, a captain cut the cardinal's cheek and one of his ears with a dagger, while Filippo Doria struck a mortal blow in his head. One historian notes, \\"'A favourite has no friends,' -- particularly a favourite of the type of Alidosi -- so that many persons, including the Legate's own servants, looked on unconcernedly upon this murder of an unpopular Churchman in broad daylight.\\"Herbert M. Vaughan, B.A., The Medici Popes (Leo X and Clement VII), London: Methuen & Co., p. 64-65 The cardinal's remains were honored by Pope Julius II with solemn exequies in the cathedral of Ravenna, where they were interred. When the cathedral was demolished in 1745, Gaspare Desiderio Martinetti, a physician, gave the cardinal's skull to the Benedictines of St. Vitale, so that it would not get mixed with other bones. From them, it passed to the Classense Library and was exposed to the public. Later, the legate, Cardinal Agostino Rivarola, had it removed and reinterred. From a recognition made on 20 June 1968, the traces of cleaving that he received on the head could still be noticed.

The district was formed as a rural sanitary district in 1875. It mirrored the Uxbridge Poor Law Union so excluded the compact market town of Uxbridge to the west which was an urban sanitary district. The twin unions in turn were all but the three small southern and three small eastern parishes of Elthorne Hundred. A little of the traditionally, essentially encircling parish in relation to Uxbridge town, Hillingdon, was added to Uxbridge USD in 1883. The parish of Northwood was removed in 1891, forming an urban sanitary district. Under the Local Government Act 1894 it became a rural district, with a directly elected rural district council. The Hillingdon parish was split, with Hillingdon West naturally forming part of the compact Uxbridge urban district and Hillingdon East being the part in the rural district. As of 1894, the district comprised parishes: *Cowley scattered in the south-centre *Harefield in the north *Hayes in the east *Hillingdon East around Cowley *Ickenham, towards the north *Northolt in the east north-east *Ruislip in the north-east *West Drayton in the south A daughter parish, Yiewsley, named after a similarly sized historic manor was created in 1896, the former southern band of Hillingdon East. Hayes became an urban district in 1904, as did Ruislip (re-merged of sorts with its daughter parish under the name Ruislip- Northwood). A Yiewsley Urban District was created in 1911, creating the only interruption in geographical continuity in the district. Northolt, an eastern 'winged' triangle of mainly Interwar housing was split in 1928 between the Municipal Borough of Ealing and Harrow on the Hill Urban District. The district was abolished in 1929. It became part of the Uxbridge Urban District, apart from the outlying, compact southern parish of West Drayton which became part of the renamed Yiewsley and West Drayton Urban District. Modern resonances The initial area with Uxbridge (the Poor Law Union plus three southern parishes which were omitted but also lay in Elthorne Hundred) are the same parent communities, parishes, as form those considered historically and ecclesiastically to form the London Borough of Hillingdon with one exception -- Northolt -- split between the London Boroughs of Ealing and the Brent. The little-relevant civil parish council and thus civil definition of parishes was abolished, locally, in the mid 20th century. Apart from what was for centuries all Ruislip, including Northwood and Eastcote in the HA postcode area, but with eastern additions as far as the old Elthorne Hundred, the poor law union emulates the UB postcode area.

It is usually performed outdoors by semi-amateur touring groups, stereotypically in a village square or the courtyard of a public building, although it is today increasingly also performed indoors and by professional performers. Ch√®o stage art is one of the great cultural heritage of the Vietnamese folk treasure. Ch√®o has been a popular art form of the Vietnamese people for many generations and has fostered the national spirit through its lyrical content.. H√°t ch√®os origins date to the 12th century during the L√Ω Dynasty and has existed in its present form since roughly the 16th century. It derives from folk traditions, and was orally transmitted; unlike courtly theater traditions, it employs no scenery and sparse costumes and makeup. It involves a combination of traditional set pieces and improvisational routines appropriate to amateur theatre. Like the Commedia dell'arte, it often carries a message of satirical criticism of the existing social order. The traditional musical ensemble consisted of fiddle, flute, and drum, though in modern recreations more instruments are used. A scene featuring h√°t ch√®o may be seen in the 2002 Vietnamese film M√™ Th·∫£o, Th·ªùi Vang B√≥ng (The Glorious Time in Me Thao Hamlet), directed by Vi·ªát Linh. History Hoa Lu ‚Äì Ninh Binh is considered as the original land of the Ch√®o, and its founder, (Mrs) Pham Thi Tran, was a talented dancer in the royal palace ‚Äì Dinh's dynasty in the 10th century. However, Ch√®o officially appears from the Ly dynasty (around the 11th century), flourished in the Tran dynasty (13th century). The development of Ch√®o has its milestone when a Mongolian military soldier was captured in Vietnam in the 14th century. Ch√®o's performance only included speak and recite folk songs prior to this period but influenced by the art of the soldier as an actor in his country, Ch√®o now also has the parts of singing. In the 15th century, King Le Thanh Tong did not allow Ch√®o to be shown in the royal court, from when Ch√®o came back to the peasants as a usual musical entertainment activity til now in the villages. Ch√®o derives from folk music and dance, especially parody since the 10th century. Gradually, people developed various short stories based on these parodies into the longer, completed plays. From loyal area's performance only, Ch√®o has been expanded to the North Delta and the North Central Coast ( to Nghe An province) and the Red River delta is the cradle of Vietnamese rice civilization. Whenever the crop is harvested, they organize festivals to entertain and thank the Gods for the harvest. From the first millennium BC, ancestors performed the first Ch√®o in the communal house yard in their village. Characteristics=General features Ch√®o belongs to the genre of drama, with ancillary music including rhythmical music, evocative music, background music, and dance music. H√°t ch√®o's is the stage singing, it can be sung by one person or many people on chorus. The melody of the Ch√®o tune is very suitable for the Vietnamese natural voice language. H√°t ch√®o's is derived from folk melodies, the lyrics of Ch√®o are derived from folk-literary works in the Northern Delta. Ch√®o stage is an integrated art form of folk songs, folk dance and others folk art forms in the Northern Delta. It is a form of storytelling, taking the stage and actors as a means of communication with the public, and can be impromptu. Ch√®o has no fixed structure with acts in a drama as in the European stage, where performers are often flexible. Therefore, the length of the play depends on the inspiration of the artist or the audience's request. Conversely to the opera that forces artists to memorize each word and sing followed by the conductor, artists are allowed to freely modify and play as long as expressing the emotions of the character. Ch√®o has three characteristics, namely, folk songs were written into the plays, the language (the way of using techniques of art mobilized) and the character images. Ancient's is often associated with the change of the form of close ones as h√°t n√≥i, h√°t x·∫©m, h√°t ch√®o ƒë√≤, h√°t ch√®o ch·∫£i, h√°t d·∫≠m. The art features consist of dramatic elements, narrative techniques, character expressions, conventions and stylistics. The language has its parts using traditional Chinese verses, stanzas, or folk songs with a very liberal, free- flowing eight-word distich metre lyrical form. Ch√®o works in group called as \\"g√°nh h√°t\\" or \\"ph∆∞·ªùng ch√®o\\", and be managed by all aspects by a person. The village festivals, summer vacation, Tet's holiday, ... \\"ph∆∞·ªùng ch√®o\\" performs from village to village, this commune to the other, serving farmers working on a square mats in the middle of the public's yard. Content of plays In terms of content, unlikely as Tu·ªìng praised the heroic actions of the noble elites, Ch√®o also depicts the simple life of rural people, praises the noble qualities of man. Lyrical content is always attached to Ch√®o, expressing human emotions, reflecting the common interests of humanity such as love, friendship and love. Stories of plays is from fairy tales, N√¥m stories rise to theatrical art of real value and deep thought. In Ch√®o, the good usually wins the evil; the warm-hearted, gentle students always promoted to the mandarin and his faithful wife finally reunite with her husband. The plays often show off funny things, the bad habits of life such as in \\"Th·∫ßy m√π\\", \\"H∆∞∆°ng c√¢m\\", \\"ƒê·ªì ƒëi·∫øc\\", \\"Quan √Çm Th·ªã K√≠nh\\", and also express humanity, as in \\"Tr∆∞∆°ng Vi√™n\\". A performance of the play Quan √Çm Th·ªã K√≠nh on December 13, 1972, at the H√°t Ch√©o Theater in Hanoi, Vietnam. Director: Vu-Khac-Khoan. Characters Characters in Ch√®o are usually normative, standardized and stereotyped. The personality of the character does not change in different plays. Cheo's surrogate characters can be swapped and reassembled in any play so they almost have no name. They can be called teachers, rich people, the prime minister, students, clowns, etc. However, there also have some characters such as Thi·ªát Th√™, Thi KinTh·ªã K√≠nh, Th·ªã M·∫ßu, S√∫y V√¢n becoming a character of its own personality by being out of general conception. \\"H·ªÅ ch√®o\\" ( Parody guy) is a character often seen in Ch√®o performances. H·ªÅ is allowed to freely ridicule people the clowns in the palace of the king of Europe. Clown scenes hide meanings which helps people to attack the bad habits of feudal society, including the king, mandarin, anyone who have rights and property in the village. There are two main types of clowns: short-shirted clown and long- shirted clown, or clown without a cane and clown with a cane. Musical instruments used Cheo uses at least three string musical instruments including ƒë√†n nguy·ªát, ƒë√†n nh·ªã v√† ƒë√†n b·∫ßu ( Vietnamese two-chord ) simultaneously adding flutes. In addition, the musicians have also to use drums and cymbals. The percussion consist of there are big drum, small drum, cylindrical drum, gong, bamboo tocsin. The small drum is used to keep the pace of singing, for the dances and for the notable sings. There is a saying \\"without drum, without Ch√®o\\" indicates the important position of the drum in Ch√®o. In modern Ch√®o, other instruments are used to enrich the accompaniment such as Vietnamese 16 chord zither, Vietnamese 36 chord zither, vertical flute and so on.

Thapa was commissioned into the 1st Battalion, 8 Gorkha Rifles in 1949. The Sino-Indian War began in October 1962; on 21October, the Chinese advanced to north of Pangong Lake with the objective of capturing Sirijap and Yula. Srijap 1 was a post established on the northern bank of Pangong Lake by the 1st Battalion of 8 Gorkha Rifles and commanded by Major Dhan Singh Thapa. Soon the post was surrounded by better armed Chinese forces. Major Thapa and his men held the post and repelled three attacks before eventually being overrun. The survivors, including Thapa, were taken as prisoners of war. For his gallant actions and his efforts to motivate his men under fire he was awarded the Param Vir Chakra. Thapa was released from captivity after the war ended. Following retirement from the Army, he worked for a brief period with Sahara Airlines. He died on 5September 2005. Early life Dhan Singh Thapa was born to P. S. Thapa on 10 April 1928, in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh. He joined the 1st Battalion, 8 Gorkha Rifles on 28August 1949, and received a temporary commission as a second lieutenant on 21 February 1951, with promotion to lieutenant on 21 February 1953. He received a permanent commission as a lieutenant on 29 September 1956, and was promoted captain on 21 February 1957. Military career=1962 Sino-Indian War There had been long disagreement between India and China over disputed borders in the Himalaya region. To counter the increasing Chinese intrusions into disputed territory, then Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru approved a plan called the \\"Forward Policy\\", which called for the establishment of a number of small posts facing the Chinese. On the night of 19‚Äì20October 1962, they attacked the eastern sector of the Indian defences. The same night they assaulted and overran the posts at Galwan, Chip Chap, and Pangong areas of Ladakh. On 21October, they advanced to north of Pangong Lake, with the objective of capturing Sirijap and Yula. =Battle at Srijap= Pangong lake The post Srijap1 was established on the northern bank of Pangong lake by the 1st Battalion, 8 Gorkha Rifles. It was part of the series of posts created to the implement the \\"Forward Policy\\". The post was strategically important for the defence of Chusul airfield. DCompany of the 1st Battalion, under the command of Major Dhan Singh Thapa, was tasked to man the post, and was responsible for an area of . As there were a number of other posts to be established, only 28 men of Dcompany were present to hold Srijap1. Meanwhile, the Chinese set up three posts around it. On 19 October 1962, with the arrival of heavy infantry troops, the strength of Chinese forces around Srijap1 witnessed a drastic increase. This caused Major Thapa to anticipate an attack; he ordered his troops to \\"dig fast and dig deep\\". As expected, the Chinese launched their first attack with artillery and mortar fire at 4:30am on 20October. This lasted for two-and-a-half hours providing good cover for their infantry, who moved towards the post. By the time shelling ended, around 600 Chinese troops had closed to within of the rear of the post. On the sight of the Chinese, the Gorkhas immediately started firing with light machine guns (LMG) and rifles, killing a large number of Chinese. The attack broke up from the post. The Chinese artillery caused many casualties on the Indian side. It also destroyed the communications of DCompany with the rest of the battalion. Major Thapa, with his second-in-command, Subedar Min Bahadur Gurung, continuously moved from place to place adjusting the defences and boosting the soldiers' morale. As time passed, the Chinese, with the help of artillery cover, reached as close as from the post. To smoke out the Indians the Chinese started attacking the post with incendiary bombs. The Gorkhas countered with hand grenades and small arms fire. Subedar Gurung, who was manning a LMG, was buried when a bunker collapsed on top him. He pulled himself out of the debris and recommenced LMG fire, inflicting heavy casualties among the Chinese until being eventually killed. By then, the post only had seven men left, with Major Thapa still holding the command. The next Chinese wave came in with heavy machine guns and bazookas. At this point, the post was also attacked from the lake-side by amphibious craft, each armed with a heavy machine gun. In the meantime two storm boats which had been sent by battalion headquarters to find out the status of Srijap 1 reached the location. Both the boats were fired upon by the Chinese. One of the boats sank, and the other was badly damaged. All the occupants of the first boat died, but the second boat with Naik Rabilal Thapa managed to escape. By that time, after a third Chinese attack, by tanks, the post was left with only three men. A bomb fell into Major Thapa's bunker, but he managed to escape the fire and came out. Though ammunition was exhausted, Thapa jumped into the trenches and killed many intruders in hand-to-hand combat before he was overpowered and taken prisoner. At battalion headquarters Naik Thapa reported that Srijap1 had fallen with no survivors. Unbeknownst to him, the last three survivors had been taken prisoner. Of these, Rifleman Tulsi Ram Thapa managed to escape the Chinese and rejoined the battalion. It was not known until much later that Major Thapa had been taken prisoner by the Chinese. Prisoner of War Major Thapa was treated poorly as a prisoner of war. Against military convention he was forced to undergo a series of punishments: firstly for killing Chinese troops; and secondly for refusing to make statements against the Indian Army and the Indian government. He was released after the war ended in November 1962. Param Vir Chakra National War Memorial, New Delhi For his gallantry actions on 20 October 1962, Major Thapa was awarded the Param Vir Chakra.

The plot tells about a group of young adults who decide to throw a Valentine's Day party, only to incur the vengeful wrath of an assailant in mining gear who begins a killing spree. Conceived and produced entirely over the course of around a year, the film was shot on location in Sydney Mines, Nova Scotia, in the fall of 1980. It was theatrically released on February 11, 1981 by Paramount Pictures, coinciding with the Valentine's holiday. Despite a mixed response from critics and grossing $5.7 million at the box office, the film has developed a large cult following over the years since its release. My Bloody Valentine faced notable censorship, having a total of nine minutes cut by the Motion Picture Association of America due to the amount of violence and gore. Though co-producer Dunning confirmed that the excised footage still existed, attempts to release it proved difficult as Paramount Pictures refused to offer an uncut version. In 2009, Lionsgate subsequently licensed the home media rights to the film and released Blu-ray and DVD editions with three minutes of additional footage restored. The same year, Lionsgate released a remake of the film. Plot Inside a mine shaft, a female miner takes off her gear in front of another miner. When the woman performs a striptease, the miner pushes her onto a mining pickaxe, killing her. Mayor Hanniger of Valentine Bluffs, a Canadian mining town, reinstates the traditional Valentine's Day dance, which has been suspended for twenty years. The dances stopped after an accident in which two supervisors left several miners in the mines to attend the dance. Because they forgot to check methane gas levels, there was an explosion that trapped the miners. Harry Warden, the only survivor, resorted to cannibalism to survive and went insane. The next year, he murdered the two supervisors who left them there, and vowed further attacks if the Valentine's Day Dance ever occurred again. Warden was placed into an asylum and the accident was forgotten, so the dance resumed. A group of young residents are excited about the dance: Gretchen, Dave, Hollis, Patty, Sylvia, Howard, Mike, John, Tommy, and Harriet. Sarah, Axel, and the mayor's son T.J. are involved in a tense love triangle. Mayor Hanniger and the town's police chief Jake Newby receive an anonymous box of Valentine chocolates containing a human heart, and a note warning that murders will begin if the dance proceeds. That evening, resident Mabel is murdered by a mining-geared killer in a laundromat, and her heart removed. Newby publicly reports that she died of a heart attack to prevent a panic. He contacts the mental institution where Harry Warden was incarcerated, but they have no record of him. Hanniger and Newby cancel the dance but the town's youngsters decide to hold their own party at the mine. A bartender warns them against it but is killed by the miner. At the party, the miner brutally kills Dave; his heart is subsequently found boiling in a pot of hot dogs being prepared in the kitchen. Shortly after, Sylvia is impaled on a shower head by the miner. When the others realize Dave and Sylvia have been murdered, they contact authorities, but several of the partygoers have already decided to enter the mines for fun. Newby rushes into the mines with police to rescue them. The miner impales a large drill into Mike and Harriet, and shoots a nail gun into Hollis's head. Horrified, Howard flees. The remaining four try to climb to the top with a ladder, but discover a dead beheaded Howard. While finding their way out, Axel and Patty are killed by the miner. The miner chases T.J. and Sarah and a fight ensues. The miner is revealed to be Axel, who faked his demise. A flashback shows that Axel's father was one of the supervisors. As a child, Axel witnessed Harry Warden murdering his father, which traumatized him. Sarah hits Axel with a rock, resulting in the tunnel collapsing, which traps Axel as Newby and the police arrive to rescue T.J. and Sarah. The police explain to them that Harry Warden died five years earlier. T.J. and Sarah hear a rescuer shout that Axel is still alive, and they rush back to the scene. They watch as Axel frees himself from the debris by amputating his trapped arm. He runs deeper into the mine shouting threats to murder everyone in town, and mumbling about Sarah being his ‚Äúbloody valentine.‚Äù The film ends with a maniacal laugh being heard (either Axel's or Harry Warden's) as a ballad for Harry Warden plays over the film's credits. CastProduction=Development Director George Mihalka, on the strength of his earlier movie Pick-Up Summer, was approached by Cinepix Productions, headed by Andr√© Link and John Dunning with a two-movie contract. Mihalka was asked to direct a horror-slasher story, presented to Dunning by Stephen Miller in mid-1980, and, after Mihalka agreed to direct, John Beaird was brought in to write the screenplay. The film was originally entitled The Secret; however, the producers decided to change it to My Bloody Valentine, so to overtly reference the holiday serial killer trend with which the slasher genre was becoming increasingly popular, through films such as Black Christmas (1974), Halloween (1978) and Friday the 13th (1980). At the time, the slasher sub-genre had seen further commercial success with the releases of Prom Night and Terror Train (both 1980). Casting Paul Kelman was cast in the lead role of T.J., while Neil Affleck was cast as Axel, his former friend and coworker. Lori Hallier was cast as Sarah, the girlfriend of Axel and ex-girlfriend of T.J. Hallier arrived to the set several weeks after the other actors, as she had prior obligations at the National Theatre School of Canada where she was studying at the time; director Mihalka, intent on casting her in the role, convinced her academic advisors to allow her to finish the semester early in order to appear in the film. Filming Shooting on My Bloody Valentine began in September 1980, taking place around the Princess Colliery Mine in Sydney Mines, Nova Scotia, which had closed in 1975. Filming completed in November 1980. The budget was approximately $2.3 million. Two mines were considered for the setting, the other in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia. The production company decided on the Sydney Mines location due to \\"the exterior [being] a dreary, cold and dusty area [with] no other buildings around it so it looked like it was totally in the middle of nowhere.\\" Mihalka has said since making the movie that the most difficult element of My Bloody Valentine was filming in the mines. Located underground, filming in the mine was a lengthy process, as, due to limited space in the elevators, it would take an hour to transport the cast and crew to the location. Also, due to the methane levels underground, lighting had to be carefully planned as the number of bulbs that could be safely utilised was limited. Prior to the production's arrival to the mine, the owners cleaned up the location significantly, leaving it described as a \\"clean and colourful Disneyland-like set.\\" This resulted in the production team spending an estimated $30,000 to paint portions of the mine to achieve a darker atmosphere, akin to how it had appeared in its original state. Producer Dunning referred to the shoot as \\"horrendous.\\" The crew kept the identity of the killer a secret to the cast members until the end of production, when the final scene was shot, in order to assure the actors played their parts in an ambiguous manner. Release My Bloody Valentine was distributed by Paramount Pictures in the United States on February 11, 1981, and in Canada on February 13, 1981. Box office My Bloody Valentine grossed US$5,672,031 at the United States box office. Though the U.S. gross exceeded the film's $2.3 million budget, it was considered a box-office disappointment by Paramount Pictures, returning a \\"derisory sum of $2.6 million.\\" This profit amounted to less than one-third of Paramount's Friday the 13th, released the year before. Critical responseContemporaneous= Upon its release, My Bloody Valentine received numerous reviews criticizing it for its depiction of violence and gore. Bruce Bailey of the Montreal Gazette noted the film as having an \\"awkward script,\\" adding: \\"All that's really notable about My Bloody Valentine is that it gives you more than the usual m.p.g.p.murders per gallon of popcorn.\\" Tom Buckley of The New York Times echoed a similar sentiment, writing: \\"My Bloody Valentine probably won't make you shiver with fright, but it's almost certain to make you squirm, first with irritation and then with revulsion.\\" The Detroit Free Presss Jack Mathews conversely complimented the film on delivering \\"on its title promise by bucketfuls,\\" adding: \\"There's nothing subtle about My Bloody Valentine. A pickax to the belly, a 10-penny nail through the forehead, a granite drill through the back. There are some passing attempts at comic relief, but most of the yuks are inadvertent.\\" Ernest Leogrande of the New York Daily News noted the film as bearing similarity to other slasher films of the time, but conceded: \\"Movies like this are designed to make you jump, scream, hide your eyes, hug your date and talk with glee about what bad taste the movie makers are capable of. My Bloody Valentine does all that.\\" Several reviewers were highly critical of the film's partial financing by the Canadian Film Development Corporation, which used taxed income from Canadian provinces to help fund its production: Among them were John Dodd of the Edmonton Journal, who lambasted the film as a \\"rip off\\" of Halloween (1978), adding: \\"All this perverted gore is brought to you thanks to the financial help of the Canadian Film Development Corp. which uses your own tax money to help greedy, talentless producers make a killing, you should pardon the expression.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune also noted the corporation's financing in his review, in which he awarded the film one out of four stars, deeming it a \\"dismal and depressing horror film,\\" and \\"another entry in that most depressing of film genres, the mad-slasher-with-a-knife.\\" Ed Blank of the Pittsburgh Press faulted the film's cinematography and mine setting, writing that its \\"novelty, for the worse as it happens, is that the principal setting is a coal mine where most of the male characters work. Shooting scenes in the mine, brightened only by the miners' hats, permits Mihalka to play without a full deck. You can't tell what's going on.\\" Dan Scapperotti of Cinefantastique, alternately praised the film's cinematography, writing: \\"[it] is beautifully photographed, and the utilization of the mine creates powerful imagery.\\" Writing for The Atlanta Constitution, Richard Zoglin noted that the film \\"floats along effortlessly in the current flood of schlock-horror films unleashed by John Carpenter's Halloween. But it is more restrained‚Äîeven tasteful‚Äîthan most. The camera averts its eyes from much of the blood and gore, and women are treated somewhat better than usual (that is, they are generally allowed to keep their clothes on before being dispatched).\\" While praising the film for constraining the amount of violence shown, Zoglin criticized the characters and the plot for being \\"uninteresting\\" and \\"predictable.\\" Linda Gross of the Los Angeles Times said the film was \\"too convoluted, too derivative and, oddly, too ambitious to properly coagulate into the kind of exploitation movie that it tries to be.\\" However, she conceded that the film's cinematography is \\"sharp\\", and the musical score \\"portentous.\\" =Retrospective= On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, My Bloody Valentine holds a 54% approval rating based on 24 reviews, with an average rating of 5.38/10. In a March 30, 2007 issue of Entertainment Weekly, the film was ranked 17 in a list of guilty pleasures, listed among such films as Dawn of the Dead and Escape from New York, and called \\"the most criminally underappreciated of the slasher genre.\\" Popular filmmaker Quentin Tarantino called it his all-time favorite slasher film. In a retrospective assessment, film historian Adam Rockoff wrote that the film was \\"easily one of the best and most polished slasher films.\\" In another retrospective assessment by scholar Jim Harper in his book Legacy of Blood: A Comprehensive Guide to Slasher Movies, he notes that the film distinguishes itself from other slashers by moving outside the \\"typical teen based scenario,\\" instead focusing on a group of twenty-something adults in a working class community, and relying on a notable \\"atmosphere dread.\\" Censorship My Bloody Valentine was significantly censored in North America upon its theatrical release. For the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) to award the movie with an R-rating, cuts were requested to every death sequence in the film. Producer Dunning said the film was essentially \\"cut to ribbons\\" in order to achieve an R-rating. Even after cutting the film to match the requirements made by the MPAA, it was again returned with an X-rating and further cuts were demanded. Stills of the trimmed footage were published in Fangoria magazine whilst the film was still in production, though the sequences were excised from the theatrical version. Even today the complete uncut version has not been released (though the 2009 DVD and Blu-ray release by Lionsgate reinstated three minutes of excised footage). The standard North American theatrical cut of the film ran approximately 90 minutes. In the United Kingdom, the film was passed for theatrical release by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) on March 30, 1981. According to the BBFC catalogue, this version ran at 90 minutes and 55 seconds. There are two reasons that are frequently attributed to the extreme cutting of the film. It has been suggested that Paramount Pictures was keen to remove the offending footage due to the backlash they had received from releasing Friday the 13th the previous year. The second reason, that Mihalka attributes, is that the movie was cut due to the murder of John Lennon in December 1980, stating that there was a major backlash against movie violence in the wake of his death. =Restoration efforts= An uncensored cut of My Bloody Valentine remained unavailable to the public for nearly thirty years after its original theatrical release. When Paramount released the film on DVD in North America for the first time in 2002, the studio claimed that the purported \\"missing\\" footage did not exist. In 2008, Lionsgate licensed the home video rights to the film after producing a feature film remake, and in the process, acquired a copy with excised footage never-before seen in the standard theatrical cut of the film. In January 2009, Lionsgate under license from Paramount released an unrated Region 1 \\"Special Edition\\" DVD and Blu-ray featuring this footage. The DVD/Blu-ray allows viewers the option to watch the standard R-rated version of the film, as well as an uncensored version in which excised violent footage is reinstated. Despite this, three scenes play in their unrated form regardless of which version is being viewed: the flashbacks of Axel's father's death, and Harry Warden with the arm. Commenting on the release, director Mihalka said: \\"[with this release] we have it back to 80% of the image back and 95% of the impact back.\\" In total, the 2009 \\"Special Edition\\" DVD/Blu-ray reinstates approximately two-and-a-half minutes of previously-unreleased footage back into the film, which contradicts an earlier claim by director Mihalka that it had been trimmed by 8‚Äì9 minutes. It has been argued that the so-called uncut DVD/Blu-ray is still missing additional footage, particularly the double- impalement of Mike and Harriet which the director recalls filming. It is thought that the remaining footage appears to be composed of expository scenes, such as dialogue and other non-violence related material. This is given credence by the fact that Mihalka gave his seal of approval to this release, and a written introduction by him precedes the beginning of the special edition DVD/Blu-ray, stating that this version was the way that the film was meant to be seen. Home media My Bloody Valentine was released to both videotape and LaserDisc in the 1980s. The film made its DVD debut on September 3, 2002 from Paramount Home Video; this was a standard widescreen release of the theatrical cut, and it contained no bonus materials. The same disc was re-issued as a DVD double feature with April Fool's Day (1986; also a Paramount title) in March 2008. On January 13, 2009, the aforementioned \\"Special Edition\\" DVD version of the film from Lionsgate was released in North America, coinciding with the theatrical release of the remake. This version integrates the cut footage back into the film and features two featurettes and optional introductory sequences to the previously missing murder sequences. Two featurettes are also included. Director Mihalka, cast members Lori Hallier, Neil Affleck, Helene Udy, and Carl Marotte, composer Paul Zaza and make-up artists Thomas Burman and Ken Diaz are all involved. A Blu-ray was released on November 24, 2009 from Lionsgate, on loan from Paramount. The disc contained the same bonus materials as the \\"Special Edition\\" DVD released in January 2009. The Blu-ray is now out of print. On July 20, 2019, Scream Factory announced they would be releasing a new 2-disc Blu-ray edition, which was released on February 11, 2020. It contains a brand new 4K transfer of both versions of the movie. Unlike the Lionsgate release, Shout! Factory actually managed to locate the original negative for much of the uncut scenes, with only a few brief shots still using the print from the previous release but much more cleaned up than before.https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/My-Bloody- Valentine-Blu-ray/248391/ Legacy and remake On January 16, 2009, shortly after the uncut version of the film was released, a remake titled My Bloody Valentine 3D was released in theaters.

The Human Dog Sled Competition is an event held in February during the Winterfest celebration of Lowell, Massachusetts, USA. Each year, a field of approximately 32 teams compete against each other in a double elimination tournament to determine the National Human Dog Sled Champion. The teams consist of six persons including four sled pullers, a sled rider, and a sled pusher. The sled race is approximately 50 meters long and takes place along a snow-covered street in downtown Lowell. Team members often dress in wacky costumes and there is a prize for the most creative of attire. The Human Dogsled Competition has been recognized for several years by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) for its animal-friendly approach to winter fun. A variety of strategies are employed to gain victory. Some teams consist of burly football players who try to win by sheer power. Other teams consist of lightly built sprinters who try to win by having a pusher who may not weigh that much. In past years, ESPN has given brief coverage to the final matchups of the event. There is no prize money associated with this race.
