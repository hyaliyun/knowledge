History Nukufetau Airfield was built by United States Navy Seabees on Motulalo island as an alternative strip to Nanumea and Funafuti airfields to allow for further dispersal of aircraft in the Ellice Islands (now Tuvalu). Two intersecting runways formed an \\"X\\" shape. On 8 September 1943 the 16th Naval Construction Battalion commenced construction of a fighter strip (3500 feet by 200 feet) and a bomber strip (6100 feet by 220 feet). Nearly 50,000 coconut trees had to be cut down and about 2,000 feet of the runways were built on fill over swamp. The first plane to land on the airfield was a PB4Y Privateer piloted by Major General Charles F. B. Price on October 3, 1943. The general conducted a quick inspection of the new airfield and quickly took off again. The airfield was officially opened on October 6, 1943. United States Marine Corps (USMC) units based at Nukufetau included: * Navy Bombing Squadron 108 (VB-108), operating PB4Y-1 Liberators, landed on 7 November 1943 * Marine Attack Squadron 331 (VMA-331), operating Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers, arrived on 15 November 1943 * 2d Airdrome Battalion - responsible for air defense of the base from August 1943 - March 1944.

History Netherton Community Centre Netherton was originally a village of its own, situated in the Parish of Kilpatrick, later New Kilpatrick in Dunbartonshire.New Kilpatrick Church History Local industry in the area during the early 19th century is recorded in the parish records as including a sandstone quarry in Netherton, supplying stone for the building of large local houses at Garscube and Blythswood, but was of sufficient quality to be exported overseas to Ireland and the West Indies. The village was annexed by Glasgow's expansion in 1912, then completely absorbed in the 1920s when the Knightswood Estate was built. The name remains in use for the area, although it no longer has significance from an administrative perspective. Several housing developments have been built in recent years, including Netherton Farm Lane, next to the Forth and Clyde Canal, and Netherton Gate, on part of the former industrial estate.

R. Rahman. Released in 2007, being one of the earliest vertical music videos, the song was conceived as an anti-poverty anthem for the Millennium Goals for the United Nations. It is part of a joint venture between the A. R. Rahman Foundation and Nokia. The song had lyrics by A. R. Rahman and Blaaze with additional lyrics by Sukhwinder Singh. The main vocalist was Rahman himself, while Blaaze accompanied him by providing backing vocals. Clinton Cerejo, Dominique Cerejo, Vivienne Pocha and Hrishikesh Kamerkar have also provided backing vocals. The video of the album was directed and conceived by Bharatbala of BharatBala Productions, who is a usual associate for Rahman's album videos. Rahman said about the song, \\"It‚Äôs a simple song, which will be very unique in its concept. The idea behind this is to spread the message of humanity. We will tell people to preserve humanity.\\" Background In 1998, after averting a major crisis in the Middle East through diplomatic means, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan had spoken the following words, \\"Never underestimate the power of prayer\\". In his eyes, it was prayer that finally gave any material means the agency to make the world a better place. The A. R. Rahman Foundation represents a movement to eradicate poverty through facilitation of education to poor and needy children. As part of the initiative, it has joined with several institutes across the globe. Pray For Me Brother is an initiative by the A.R. Rahman Foundation, with Nokia Corporation to collect funds for the U.N. Millennium Development Programme aimed at eradicating poverty by the year 2015. It is a song about the emotion that lies at the heart of prayer ‚Äì the emotion of love. It reinstills our faith in love‚Äôs power to heal and reminds us that there are those in this world who need of our gestures of healing and comfort. The song was made available for a free download at the official website of U.N. Millennium Goals. Speaking on the occasion of the audio launch, Rahman said, One thing is common about hunger-everybody feels it. This song is a statement from India to the world. Otherwise we listen and the world talks. I have seen beggars everywhere. This song is not a remedy but an inspiration to do something. World Health Organization official Sathya suggested I should come up with a song for the tuberculosis cause for which U.N. had appointed me as their Brand Ambassador. As I was doing this, I noticed the poverty around that we seem to have become immune to. I called my friend Blaaze and asked if we could do something, hence the song was born, he added. The film is set primarily in Los Angeles, USA, where progress and plenitude abound. Lives and lifestyles there stand in stark contrast to those parts of the world where pain and suffering abound. The film attempts to bring these two worlds together through its story and in doing so depicts the dawning of a particular realization on its protagonist ‚Äì that he need not wait for a reason to show kindness, that now was the time for him to offer a healing prayer to his brothers and sisters in need across the world. Several taglines and quotes that would inspire the world were given within the album art. Some of them were *\\"Our world spends 736 Billion every year on WAR, Our world spends 130 Trillion every year on weapons of mass destruction. This can provide food, shelter & clothing for all the people in the world, 20 times over.\\" *\\"Our World Needs a Prayer.\\" *\\"This song is dedicated to inspire people to eradicate poverty from our world. And to give hope to all people suffering from oppression, injustice and cruelty due to foreign forces or their own cruel leaders. And to those that are deprived of love and compassion. And to fill the void which exists in each and everyone of us. And to those that are searching for a reason to be kind.\\" *\\"All Perfect Praises Belong to The Almighty Alone.\\" Music video The film was conceived and directed by Bharatbala in the banner of BharatBala Productions. The song was picturised in Los Angeles, USA, with cinematography by Tassaduq Hussain Mufti. The choreography was done by Cassel Dixion Jr, Talent Bryan Clark and Adele Jones.

The project is funded by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) and gets its technical support from Averbis Ltd. The portal first went online May 29, 2009 and currently runs in the updated beta version. In the context of the 'Germany - Land of Ideas' (Deutschland - Land der Ideen) initiative under the patronage of the President of Germany Horst K√∂hler the ZB MED was awarded the distinction 'Selected Landmark 2009' (Ausgew√§hlter Ort 2009).Pressemitteilung im Informationsdienst Wissenschaft vom 15. Mai 2009 Objective The Greenpilot portal is a digital library specialised in the fields of Nutritional, Agricultural and Environmental Sciences. It aims to provide researchers in the three fields with a collection of scientific literature which is easy to access and of high quality. Especially the gray literature is often difficult to find and retrieve for the average user so Greenpilot also aims to make access to these sources easier. The service addresses itself not only to scientists and students but also to the broadly interested public. Greenpilot has been modelled after the corresponding digital library for Medicine, Medpilot,Medpilot portal also a project of the German National Library of Medicine. The ZB MED has chosen the slogan 'Greenpilot - all about life and science' as a motto. In Greenpilot scientifically relevant databases, library catalogues and websites can be searched by entering a search term and the results are presented in a standardised web interface. Technical Background Greenpilot is a search engine based on intuitive search engine technology. The portal's software was developed in the programming language Perl. The search engine technology is based upon the 'Averbis Search Platform' software developed by the Averbis Ltd. and uses the open source software Lucene. Functionally this is an expert search engine which centres around the intelligent semantic connection of search terms by means of a standardised vocabulary. This is made possible by Averbis's MSI software which provides: * semantic search optimised for the fields of Medicine and Life Sciences * a contextual analysis of texts taking synonyms and compounds into account * multilingual and cross-language search * linking of lay and expert vocabulary The search results are generated from a search index. Additionally a metasearch can be conducted in order to search other databases not contained in the index. This search is based upon individual results from the specific database searched. Contents The Greenpilot portal integrates various scientifically relevant information resources under a uniform search interface. These resources are diverse and encompass national and international expert databases, library catalogues of national libraries with a focus on specific topics, full text documents from open access journals as well as information contained on about one thousand scientifically relevant websites selected for Greenpilot.

GNU parallel is free software, written by Ole Tange in Perl. It is available under the terms of GPLv3.  Usage  Introduction video, Part 1 Introduction video, Part 2 The most common usage is to replace the shell loop, for example for x in \`cat list\` ; do do_something \\"$x\\" done  process_output to the form of cat list  parallel do_something  process_output where the file \`list\` contains arguments for \`do_something\` and where \`process_output\` may be empty. Scripts using parallel are often easier to read than scripts using pexec. The program parallel features also * grouping of standard output and standard error so the output of the parallel running jobs do not run together; * retaining the order of output to remain the same order as input; * dealing nicely with filenames containing special characters such as space, single quote, double quote, ampersand, and UTF-8 encoded characters; By default, parallel runs as many jobs in parallel as there are CPU cores. Examples find . -name \\"*.foo\\"  parallel grep bar The above is the parallel equivalent to: find . -name \\"*.foo\\" -exec grep bar {} + This searches in all files in the current directory and its subdirectories whose name end in \`.foo\` for occurrences of the string \`bar\`. The parallel command will work as expected unless a file name contains a newline. In order to avoid this limitation one may use: find . -name \\"*.foo\\" -print0  parallel -0 grep bar The above command uses the null character to delimit file names. find . -name \\"*.foo\\"  parallel -X mv {} /tmp/trash The above command expands \`{}\` with as many arguments as the command line length permits, distributing them evenly among parallel jobs if required. This can lower process overhead for short-lived commands that take less time to finish than they do to launch. find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -name \\"*.ogg\\"  parallel -X -r cp -v -p {} /home/media The command above does the same as: cp -v -p *.ogg /home/media However, the former command which uses \`find\`/\`parallel\`/\`cp\` is more resource efficient and will not halt with an error if the expansion of *.ogg is too large for the shell.

It currently functions as a bar, restaurant and nightclub, although it was first built as the headquarters of the Commercial Bank of Scotland in 1847. The building was designed by David Rhind in a Graeco-Roman style. It stands on the site of the Physicians' Hall, the offices of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, which was constructed in the 18th century to designs by James Craig, the planner of the New Town. The Dome is a category A listed building.. The current operating business is Caledonian Heritable, a hotel, bars and restaurant group founded by Portobello born entrepreneur Kevin Doyle (also Archerfield, Ryan's Bar, & co) Physicians' Hall The Physicians Hall on George Street in Edinburgh 1780 The Dome stands on the site of the old Physicians' Hall, by architect James Craig. As the winner of the New Town planning competition in 1766, he received few commissions for individual buildings within his masterplan. However, he did design the Physicians' Hall for the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. This fine building was largely demolished to create the current building, but parts of the frontage appear to be re-used including the fine Corinthian columns. Aesthetically, the Hall was striking and beautiful to the eye. Its foundation stone was laid in 1776. The building, with an frontage, had a portico supported by four Corinthian columns and gave the College of Physicians a permanent home again after several decades in a building behind the Royal Infirmary on what is now Drummond Street.Hamish Coghill, 2005 Unfortunately, the sense of permanence was not achieved because the Hall did not suit the need of the physicians. Since the Hall was built for lecturing purposes both for students and existing physicians, it is said not to have achieved its original goal. Being offered a large sum for the George Street site, the College relocated slightly to the north on Queen Street (and remains there still). Outlook on transformation Owned by Scotland's Commercial Bank, a new project by architect David Rhind was on the horizon for the now empty lot. Previous to this architectural movement, the Church was the central structure in terms of financial dedication. Now, money was filtered and dedicated to the construction of banks and commercial property. \\"This undermined the political power of the old society of landed and established religious interests was now followed by a further acceleration of capitalist-led social and economic transformation\\".Miles Glendinning, Ranald MacInnes, and Aonghus MacKechnie, 1996 This means that to represent Scotland's more socialist outlook, buildings focused on serving the community as a whole, not just an elite or selective audience. The Scottish capitalist movement was an architectural turning point in Scotland. \\"The earlier building types of capitalism were refined and elaborated. Banks and insurance companies built ever more grandiose headquarters and branches in the cities, along with offices for lawyers, shipping firms and land agents; the construction of bank chambers from the 1840s (as with David Rhind's work for the Commercial Bank) constituted one of the biggest ever building campaigns in Scottish cities\\". To further portray the socialistic thinking, the Commercial Bank's style focused a great deal on unity, a fundamental value of the belief. \\"The whole is sculptured in a very high style of art, the prevailing feeling of the different groups being in harmony with each other, blending into a whole, and so uniting with the details and general effect of the edifice as to combine the tout ensemble into an interesting and delightful unity\\".Fine Art's Journal In terms of economic outlook, Scotland's views had changed from Socialistic to Capitalistic. Construction of the bank David Rhind saw this perspective of capitalism and traced the idea roots all the way back to Greek society. \\"From the mid- 1830s and early 1840s, while Thomas Hamilton and Playfair had continued to exploit the potential of explicitly Grecian architecture, William Burn, David Bryce (Burn's partner 1841‚Äì1850) and David Rhind had begun to move towards an astylar, Italian palazzo-like classicism for some commercial buildings and club-houses, and a Graeco-Baroque grandeur for others ‚Äì in both cases, combined with a somewhat Greek sharpness of detail\\". With this mindset, a classical revival became highly evident in Scottish architecture. \\"By the end of the 1840s, there developed that aspect of Neoclassical architecture, known as Greco-Roman, whose influence was strongest among Scottish banks\\".Elliot, Charles, and George Cleghorn, 1958 Rhind embraced these ideas as he started to construct the building which is now called The Dome. \\"The front of this banking-house, a really magnificent structure, which has been erected in George Street, exhibits a Corinthian hexastyle portico ninety-five feet in width, of great general beauty, and having a bold but not obtrusive projection; the columns of which it is composed, six in number, as the name of its style indicates, are thirty-five feet high, of very graceful proportions, with a happily adapted intercolumniation, and having elegant well-relieved and spiritedly carved capitals\\".Fine Art's Journal, 1847 In other words, the building is representative of Doric order and Greek classicism. The windows of are arched and simple, very similar to those designed by Andrea Palladio in the Villa Godi. The front architrave is quite comparable to the Temple of Agrigento. The sculpture on the portico is by Alexander Handyside Ritchie.Buildings of Scotland: Edinburgh by Gifford, McWilliam and Walker The Commercial Bank Not only did the Commercial Bank capture ideology of society but it also captured a sense of beauty. In April 1847, The Scotsman wrote, \\"'the rich and massive architecture of the front', and the interior decoration 'in a style which is not less than gorgeous'\\". It can be drawn that the interior again resorts back to a classical style with columns and a central dome. David Rhind clearly took advantage of light source, by constructing the dome of glass, as well as giving the building a more modern appeal. Present day The Commercial Bank of Scotland, through a series of mergers, is now part of the Royal Bank of Scotland. However, the walls, windows, floors, and dome of the building remain present today. David Rhind incorporated the use of light by using a glass dome, and made use of space with a large central lobby. Although one of many buildings in a Greek Revival style, The Dome stands unique on George Street with its stunning pediment and long rich history.

Local fisherman can be seen casting reels and nets into the shorebreak on any given day, while boats varying in size and shape are dropping nets into the Atlantic and pulling in different species of saltwater fish. The beach is a relaxing spot to surf during the late summer and early fall. \\"With its historic fishing villages and some of the best surfing along the East Coast, Coquina Beach was included in the 2009 Top 10 Beaches ranking, as judged by Florida International University's Laboratory for Coastal Research\\".Fodors.com Coquina Beach review Shipwreck The shipwreck of the Laura Barnes sailing ship is located on Coquina Beach. The Laura Barnes is representative of the many wooden sailing ships that were lost on the Outer Banks. \\"The four-masted schooner out of Camden, Maine was driven ashore during a nor‚Äôeaster on the night of June 1, 1921\\".Coastal Guide - the Laura Barnes Shipwreck. The entire crew was rescued by Coast Guardsmen from nearby Bodie Island Station and the stranded ship was stripped and sold to some locals for salvage at an auction. Some parts of the Laura Barnes went into building a house, which is a very common occurrence on the Outer Banks. Storms shifted the remaining wreckage about a mile south of the original location on Coquina Beach, across from the Bodie Island Lighthouse. There an exhibit is provided for public viewing giving additional information about the wreck. Commercial Fishing Coquina also provides a glimpse into the rapidly vanishing commercial fishing industry. \\"Every day, in good weather and bad, commercial fishermen spread nets out in long lines on the hard-packed sand, checking for tears and tangles\\". After passing inspection, the nets are loaded onto small hand-built wooden boats, also called dorys, which fight their way through surf and drop them in calmer waters from the Atlantic shore. Later in the day, these same boats retrieve the ends of the nets, cruise to shore, and attach them to pickup trucks. Local businesses rely on commercial fishing for fresh seafood and employment throughout the year. Accessibility Coquina Beach is accessible by foot. Those holding a valid permit can drive on the beach or host a bonfire.

The Council having abandoned the general use of the nihil obstat and imprimatur to approve publications, and of the index to restrict access to undesirable publications, the new pastoral instruction outlined the relations with public media that Church authorities were henceforth to adopt: recognition of the freedom of information and free choice of information, the legitimate independence of the activity of journalists and media institutions, and the need to educate members of the Church in the discriminating use of media.

She was the daughter of Georg and Susanne Schwidetzky. Susanne Schwidetzky, who studied math at the University of Berlin around 1900, died in 1911 of tuberculosis. Georg Schwidetzky studied law and had a successful political career which ended with World War I. The family moved to Leipzig, where Georg Schwidetzky worked for Die Deutsche B√ºcherei, roughly equivalent to the Library of Congress. Ilse Schwidetzky had three siblings, Eva (born in 1905, died 1958), Walter (born in 1910, died in 1996), and Georg (a half-brother born in 1917, died in 2003). She is related to Oscar Schwidetzky, who invented the ace bandage and was the first non-MD admitted to the American Medical Association (common relative, Leopold Schwidetzky, her great-grandfather). Ilse Schwidetzky studied history, biology and anthropology in Leipzig and Breslau. From the 1930s, she worked as the assistant of Egon Freiherr von Eickstedt, one of the leading racial theorists of Nazi Germany. Schwidetzky married Bernhard R√∂sing in 1940, also a professor. They lived in different cities. Then and now it is not uncommon for two-professor couples in Germany to live apart given how few positions there are for professors. The couple had three children, among them ethnologist Ina R√∂sing and anthropologist Friedrich Wilhelm R√∂sing. Bernhard R√∂sing was killed in a train accident in 1944. The train carried an army reserve unit of which Bernhard R√∂sing was a member. The unit was tasked with conducting clean up operations. It was a \\"regular\\" train accident and not caused by any military action. Bernhard R√∂sing was the only member of Ilse Schwidetzky's closer family who died during World War II. All of her children, her siblings and her father survived the war. Schwidetzky worked at the newly founded Anthropological Institute at Mainz University from 1946, succeeding Eickstedt as Mainz Professor of Anthropology in 1961 until her retirement in 1975. She published under her maiden name, not her married name.

Background Snitker was born Waukon, Iowa, to Patricia and Dennis Snitker, and lived on the family farm until age 5. He moved to New Port Richey, Florida when he was 8 years old where he later graduated from Gulf High School. While in high school he was a member of the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps. During this time he commanded the school's drill team. While attending high school he also trained and taught Isshin-ry≈´ karate in which he achieved a black belt. He then served eight years in the U.S. Marine Corps, where he was deployed in Haiti and Norway, and served aboard the . He is married to Kelly Snitker, and has a young son. He worked for AXSA Document Solutions until July 2010, when he left his job to campaign full-time. 2010 United States Senate race Snitker placed second behind Republican Marco Rubio in the Orlando Tea Party Straw Poll in February 2010, where he placed ahead of both Charlie Crist, the incumbent Republican Governor, and Democrat front runner Kendrick Meek. Though he has received little mainstream media coverage, he has a larger following on the Internet than most of his major party competitors according to Alexa Internet. He is endorsed by former U.S. Senate candidate Dennis Bradley, The Tenth Amendment Center, Liberty Candidates, 912 Candidates, Retake Congress. He is a proponent of a Constitutionally-limited federal government, individual liberty, and a non-interventionist foreign policy, and is a proponent of citizen and states rights. His specific proposals include the repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment (income tax) in favor of the FairTax, a national sales tax on end-user goods and services. He also proposes a balanced budget amendment, term limits for Congressmen, and eliminating Congressional perks and pensions. Exclusion from debates During his 2010 U.S. Senate campaign, Snitker was excluded from all seven of the televised debates between the three major candidates. Rivals Kendrick Meek, Democrat, and Charlie Crist, no party affiliation, both publicly supported Snitker's inclusion in the debates. However, GOP candidate Marco Rubio declined to comment on the issue. The organizers of these debates, all major media outlets, cited his lack of support in the polls as the reason for Snitker's exclusion. Since the pollsters would not place his name on the polls, he had no opportunity to meet the criteria to be included in the debates. This apparent Catch-22 has been called the \\"Snitker Paradox\\" by some in the media. Radio program In response to his exclusion from the mainstream media, Snitker purchased a two-hour time slot every Friday on radio stations WTAN 1340 AM in Clearwater and 1350 AM in Dade City/Zephyrhills for a call-in political talk show. After the election, Snitker partnered with Adrian Wyllie, the Chairman of the Libertarian Party of Florida, to form the 1787 Radio Network.

Duncan was a character of the Brisbane Rugby League (BRL) and was signed by Brisbane club Valleys in 1980 after playing much of his junior football in Mount Isa. He made his first grade debut for the Valleys Diehards against the Redcliffe Dolphins at Lang Park in 1980 as a teenager, but it wasn't until 1982 where he became a regular in the Diehards' first-grade line-up. That season, he was seen by Valleys coach Ross Strudwick as a better option at five-eighth than eventual rugby league immortal, Wally Lewis, who was forced to play much of the 1982 BRL season in his original position of lock-forward. Duncan's ability to bust the defence with his bulky frame and his undeniable ball skills were noticed by Sydney talent scouts and he was subsequently signed by the Illawarra Steelers for the NSWRFL's 1983 Winfield Cup season. Duncan made a couple of appearances in first grade for the Steelers that yearDarryl Duncan at yesterdayshero.com.auDarryl Duncan at stats.rleague.com but eventually left mid-season, returning to Valleys where he played first and reserve grade. Duncan moved back to Mount Isa in 1984, representing the North Queensland Marlins in the Winfield State League of that season. He was instrumental in helping the Marlins become the first country side to make the finals of that particular competition. They lost to glamour Brisbane club Wynnum-Manly in the semi final at Lang Park (22-0). Duncan headed back to the BRL for the 1985 season where he signed with the Norths Devils. He captained the Devils that season, alternating between five-eighth and second-row. He captained the Devils on and off for the rest of his BRL career which ended in 1993 after nine-straight seasons with Norths. Career highlights Duncan's highlights during his time with Norths included captaining the Devils in the famous 1990 Grand Final loss to Valleys and winning the Rothmans Medal Award in 1991 for the competition's best and fairest player.Rothmans Medal/ Sunstate Player of the Year Winners He became the second 'Darryl' from Norths to win the medal, following in the footsteps of look alike Darryl Brohman. He also made the 4BC BRL Team of the 80's. Duncan once kicked a field goal after the siren to give the underdog Devils a shock 23-22 win over the then reigning BRL premiers Wynnum-Manly in a match at Bishop Park in 1985. He returned to Mount Isa as a player-coach for local team Wanderers and in 2009 guided the club to a memorable 28-26 upset victory over Town in the A Grade grand final.

They received numerous design awards and commendations from the Royal Australian Institute of Architects and won the competition for the Reserve Bank of Australia Building in Canberra in 1962. Their designs combined Modern style and Classical rationale, which resulted in ordered and axial aspects. Howlett and Baileys Architects‚Äôs major projects included the Public Suite, the Beatty Park Pool kiosk and Manager‚Äôs house (now demolished), and the two Australian landmarks the Council House (1962) and the Perth Concert Hall (1973). Howlett and Bailey Architects merged with Cox Architects in 1995 to create Cox Howlett & Bailey Architects. In 1998 the company merged with Forbes & Fitzhardinge Woodland to form Cox Howlett & Bailey Woodland Architects, which still practices today. Jeffrey Howlett Jeffrey Howlett (1928‚Äì2005), founder of the Howlett and Bailey Architects firm, is known as a pioneer of Western Australian Modernist architect. He was awarded as a State Living Treasure by the Western Australian and the Life Fellowship by the RAIA in 1978. In 2000, due to his contributions to architecture as a designer and pedagogue, he was nominated a Member of the Order of Australia. After spending his early life in Hyderabad, India, Howlett came to England to receive his scholarship for Diploma in Architectural Association School of Architecture in London. From 1950, he worked in England for the London Country Council before coming to Australia to work with several Perth‚Äôs practices. Later, Howlett came to Melbourne to continue his career as a Senior Design architect with Bates Smart and Mc Cutcheon. In Melbourne, together with Donald Bailey, who soon to be his co-operator, they won the new Perth City Council administration buildings competition. The Howlett and Bailey Architects firm was constituted after that when they moved to Perth. Donald Bailey described Howlett as a specially talent and creative designer. In 1992, there was an exhibition, held by University of Western Australia, named Howlett: Architectural projects. After suffering from a major stroke in 1993, his life was rely on the wheelchair and he mainly using oil pastel and paper to keep expressing his creativity through forms and colours.

Major Projects=Council House, Perth Because Perth was hosting the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in 1962, the Perth City Council decided to construct a new headquarters with a modern design to showcase the development of the state. Howlett and Bailey won the competition for the new administration building with their Council House design in 1960, out of 61 entries. The Council House was opened by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in a ceremony in 1963. The design reflects the minimalist modern style which influenced the new Perth City plan. It is 13 storeys with opening extension and relative lowness. The interior is designed to give maximum working space in relation to its gross area. The fa√ßade is constructed with windows curtain system and T shape sun hoods which provide effective use of artificial and natural lighting. Council House became the pride of Perth citizens.

It is known as the Prince William Railway, the first railway linking the valleys of the Wupper and the Ruhr. The first line on the route was opened in 1831 by the Deil Valley Railway Company (German: Deilthaler Eisenbahn Aktiengesellschaft) along the Deilbach Valley and was the first railway in Germany, although horse-hauled until its conversion to standard gauge in 1847. Construction of the line=Deil Valley Railway Company/Prince William Railway Company  On 21 June 1844 the Prince William Railway Company (German: Prinz-Wilhelm-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, PWE) had received the concession for the rebuilding of its existing line between Nierenhof (near Langenberg, now part of Velbert) and Hinsbek (a suburb of Kupferdreh, now part of Essen). The line was converted from narrow gauge () to standard gauge () and extended in the south to Vohwinkel and in the north to √úberruhr and opened for passenger operations on 1 December 1847. Bergisch- M√§rkische Railway Company The Bergisch-M√§rkische Railway Company (German: Bergisch-M√§rkische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, BME) took over operation of the route on 27 March 1854 and on 1 January 1863 it acquired the Prince William Railway Company and its line. It extended the line in a north-easterly direction to Steele (later Steele Hauptbahnhof, now Essen-Steele Ost station, connecting to a section of its Witten/Dortmund‚ÄìOberhausen/Duisburg line opened in March 1862) and from there along the Ruhr through Dahlhausen and on to Langendreer BME. The Essen-√úberruhr‚ÄìBochum-Langendreer line was opened five months later on 1 June 1863. Terminal station Former terminal station Since the extension of the line in 1847 trains had to reverse in the terminal station (German: Kopfstation, literally \\"head station\\") in the Siebeneick Valley to continue their journey. This need was overcome in 1868 with the realignment of the track and the closure of the station. Ruhr Valley Railway On 1 February 1872 the first part of the BME's Ruhr Valley Railway was opened from D√ºsseldorf-Oberbilk to Essen-Kupferdreh, and in 1874 another section of it from Essen-√úberruhr to Hagen-Vorhalle (connecting with the Elberfeld‚ÄìDortmund line). Both routes now no longer connect with the Prince William line, the sections from Essen-Kupferdreh to Essen-Werden and Essen- √úberruhr via Altendorf (now Essen-Burgaltendorf) to Bochum-Dahlhausen are now closed and partially dismantled. Current situation N9 local service between Kupferdreh and Nierenhof in 1986 prior to the electrification of the line In the 1970s work began on developing the main lines in the central Ruhr area for the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn. On 1 February 1978 a direct connection was opened for the first time from Essen-√úberruhr to Essen-Steele (then Essen- Steele West), while the line between Essen-√úberruhr and Essen-Steele Ost was closed. The new connecting curve is a single-track line like the old line. This work allowed a new through service. Instead of going to Essen-Steele Ost and further east, trains from Wuppertal-Vohwinkel could continue to Essen Hauptbahnhof. The section from Essen-Steele Ost to Bochum- Dahlhausen West junction had already been incorporated (on 26 May 1974) into S-Bahn line S3. The Wuppertal-Vohwinkel-Essen √úberruhr line was upgraded for its inclusion in the S-Bahn on 15 December 2003 and electrified for its whole length. Velbert- Rosenh√ºgel station was rebuilt and Velbert-Neviges station was relocated. In addition, the Aprath station closed in 1965 was reopened as W√ºlfrath-Aprath station. The old platforms of Domap station, which was closed in May 1965, were also demolished. S-Bahn line S9 runs every 20 minutes (every 30 minutes on weekends) from Wuppertal to Wuppertal-Vohwinkel, Essen-√úberruhr, Essen- Steele, Essen and Bottrop. Once an hour S-Bahn trains continue to Haltern am See.

Biography (Giacomo) Alberto Mantelli studied at Liceo Classico Massimo d'Azeglio of Torino, under Augusto Monti and Italo Maione. He graduated in Law in Turin with a thesis on \\"The object of copyright in musical creation\\" His thesis formed a reference point for the argument. It was printed (GA Mantelli, \\"The object of copyright in musical creation,\\" Milan 1933) and was republished in 1937 in the series of monographs by the publisher of Private Law \\"Athenaeum\\" of Rome. He contributed to the Rivista Musicale Italiana (1932) with an essay entitled \\"Debussy and Mallarm√©\\" and, subsequently, to the Rassegna Musicale, where he published articles on Stravinsky, Hindemith, Berg and Ravel, among others. In 1936 he wrote the first essay appeared in Italy on Alban Berg (La Rassegna Musicale, 1936). He created the Italian rhythmic version of Alban Berg's Wozzeck for the famous first performance in Rome in 1942.No misprint, Wozzeck in Italy in 1942. See R. Vlad, ¬´E Hitler chiam√≤ Mussolini: cancella il Wozzeck¬ª, Corriere della Sera, 30 settembre 2003, p. 50 In the same year he published the Guide to Wozzeck.La Lampada, 1942 His essay \\"Three centuries of European music\\" Il Balcone, Milano, 1937 was published in 1947, when Mantelli also edited the first Italian edition of the autobiography of Igor Stravinsky \\"Croniques de ma vie,\\" which he also translated. At that time, Mantelli was also a member of the organizing committee of the International Festival of Contemporary Music at the Venice Biennale. Mantelli started working at EIAR in Rome in 1938 in the Programming Office. After a break due to war, he returned to EIAR (later, RAI) in 1946 as the manager of the music sector of the radio station of Turin. The Italian Third Radio Programme In 1950, during Sernesi's RAI direction, Mantelli conceived, organized and directed the Third Radio Programme. The Third Programme began broadcasting at 9 in the evening of Sunday, October 1, 1950, from the FM stations in Bologna, Florence, Genoa, Milan, Naples, Rome, Turin, Venice and from the short-wave station of Rome. The first show was dedicated to the myth of Orpheus with an introduction by Emilio Cecchi and works Claudio Monteverdi, Jacques Offenbach and Igor Stravinsky. The Third Programme broadcast from 9 to 11:15 in the evening and was conceived as the cultural programme for the Italian public broadcasting service (RAI). Mantelli's approach was far more interesting than the label suggests: 'Provided, of course, that the term culture is assumed in its most alive and real sense of expression of the spiritual life, and also, extending somewhat its meaning, in the sense of a living and concrete reflection on the issues in which man exists, struggles, and grows today. It would be naive to mark borders not to cross, prohibited areas that cannot be violated, when one well knows that it is human and at times inevitable to go out of the sign. It is obvious that in saying culture in this sense, one wants to avoid to identify it with pure scholarship which is essentially the basis and instrument of culture, and as such cannot be the fundamental object of a forum open to the public as is radio. \\" A. Mantelli, Il Terzo Programma, Radiocorriere, 27:38, Sept. 1950 As it is evident from the first evening's program, Mantelli conceived and realized the idea of subject evenings, which would later become a widespread approach in radio and television programs, \\"the whole transmission of an evening to which texts, music, theater, narrative can contribute, revolves around a subject which may be from time to time, an artist (Gide, Clair, Schumann), a myth (Orpheus), a city as an expression of culture and civilization (Vienna, world of yesterday), a cultural milestone (Paris 1830), and so on. \\" A. Mantelli, Il Terzo Programma, Radiocorriere, 27:38, Sept. 1950 The transition from undifferentiated radio programmes to specific (light, cultural and \\"medium\\") radio channels, interested in the same period the French radio and BBC (e.g., the BBC third cultural program). The contribution of Mantelli to this transformation was recognized by, among others, E. M. Forster.The BBC talks of E. M. Forster, 1929-1960: a selected edition Subsequent years Subsequently, Mantelli held major posts in RAI, and, in 1959 he became central deputy director of radio programs. Among his responsibilities, relationships with European and international radio and music organizations. He continued his collaboration with the Third Programme, particularly for music programming, and he edited numerous broadcasts for it. In 1958, Mantelli founded L'Approdo Musicale, of the most important Italian journals of music criticism, which he directed from the first to the last number. The journal, published by ERI, was conceived as a series of single numbers on composers, mostly modern and contemporary one: the first issue was devoted to Alfredo Casella, the last one to Anton Bruckner. The number on Debussy was entirely written by Mantelli. Mantelli was involved with the organization of the \\"Prix Italia\\", since its first edition in Capri in 1948. He also edited its beautiful and important annual publications. In 1955, Mantelli and founded the Musical Phonology Studio in Milan, to which Mantelli actively collaborated.

Early life  Boucher was born in the small town Webster, Massachusetts on July 29, 1943, one of seven children born to parents of French descent. While attending high school, she excelled in baseball and track and field. As a young girl, she became an avid fan of professional wrestling. After befriending professional wrestler Pat Patterson, he introduced her to The Fabulous Moolah, who agreed to train her despite misgivings about her small stature.  Professional wrestling career  In 1962, Boucher enrolled in The Fabulous Moolah's professional wrestling school in Columbia, South Carolina, training for six months before making her debut. She was given the ring name \\"Bette\\" by The Fabulous Moolah to appear more exotic. Her first bout was for Jim Crockett Promotions in North Carolina, losing to Penny Banner. After wrestling for two years, Boucher joined the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based American Wrestling Association. In the late-1960s, Boucher's sister Shirley began wrestling under the ring name \\"Rita Boucher\\". The sisters spent two years as a tag team before Shirley retired due to family commitments. Boucher defeated The Fabulous Moolah to win the NWA World Women's Championship on September 17, 1966. The Fabulous Moolah regained the championship from her one month later. As The Fabulous Moolah was billed as having held the championship uninterrupted for decades, title reigns such as this were not always recognized. Boucher retired from professional wrestling in 1970 to start a family.  Personal life  Boucher married in 1970. She and her husband had four children before divorcing in 1992.

It was built as part of a series of malls including the Woburn Mall, and the Mystic Mall. Anchor stores include Burlington and Market Basket. History The Billerica Mall thrived in the 1970s up to the early 1990s. In 1998, The Billerica Flick closed down and the space is now a Dollar Tree. In 2005, Burlington Coat Factory closed off their mall entrance. Home Depot tried to locate there and rebuild the mall, but a group called \\"Billerica First\\" defeated this proposal in 2007. In 2009, Billerica gave RD Management 1 year to remodel the mall or it would be shut down. In the summer of 2009, the workers' tools created carbon monoxide which caused the entire mall to be evacuated and aired out. In February 2010, the roof by Kmart collapsed and the mall had to be shut down temporarily. The mall is now being converted (\\"demalled\\") into a strip mall. Timetable for the completion of the renovation of the mall is unknown. In mid-2011, RD Management began to add exterior- accessible store fronts and refinished the exterior of the mall with a new tan color scheme. A new sign was installed. On the new sign the mall was renamed \\"Shops at Billerica\\". On November 7, 2019, Sears announced that Kmart would be closing as part of a plan to close 96 stores nationwide.

In 1982, the Indian Air Force (IAF) procured the MiG-29 Fulcrum from the Soviet Union to modernize its fighter program. As a result, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) began looking for new technology to replace its aging fighters. By 1984, the PAF's F-7P (Chengdu F-7) fighters were equipped with Western electronic systems. The PAF began developing and manufacturing an improved version of the F-7M to replace its large fleet of F-6S fighters. The Pakistan Air Force started looking for a new fighter to replace their large fleet of Shenyang F-6 fighters, as they approached the end of their service lives in the late 1980s.Alan Warnes \\"Pakistan's Vision: Bridging The Capabilities Gap\\" Air Forces Monthly (Magazine issue: July 2004) Page: 33 (can be viewed at URL: http://www.defencetalk.com/pictures/showphoto.php/photo/3207) After showing interest in the F-7M, the Air HQ of the Pakistan Air Force initiated Project Sabre‚ÄìII to the develop a low-cost multirole fighter jet on the model of the F-7M. Design feasibility A schematics of PAF's F-7M, of which its design was studied. In January 1987, the Pakistan Air Force commissioned New York- based Grumman Aerospace to conduct studies and assess the feasibility of the Sabre II design concept with Pakistani specialists and the Chinese Chengdu Aircraft corporation. After five to seven months, the group concluded that the financial risks caused by very high project costs, and the availability of more cost-effective options outweighed the potential benefits from technology transfer from the US to the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex, increasing its experience and technical knowledge. Grumman, the Pakistan Air Force and the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) created the Sabre II concept by radically upgrading the F-7M.\\"China: J-7 (MiG-21), Flight International magazine, published 19 August 1989, URL: http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1989/1989%20-%202539.html?search=Sabre%20II Retrieved: 18 October 2009 Changes to the F-7M to create the Sabre II included upgrades to its avionics suite, radar system and engine, and a redesigned forward fuselage. The PAF stated that the Sabre II would replace ~150 F-6 in PAF's combat service. A picture showed that the F-7's nose inlet had been replaced with a solid nose radome and a new pair of air inlets were mounted on the sides of the fuselage under the cockpit.\\"Grumman Reveals Sabre II for Pakistan\\", Flight International magazine, published 19 September 1987, URL: http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1987/1987%20-%201745.html?search=Sabre%20II Retrieved: 18 October 2009 Under Project Sabre II and the Chinese Super-7 project, the F-7 airframe was redesigned with angled air intakes on the sides of the fuselage so a solid radome nose could house radar and other avionics from Northrop's F-20 \\"Tigershark\\" fighter. The Chinese WP-7 turbojet engine was to be replaced with a modern turbofan engine, either the GE F404 or PW1120, to improve performance. The resulting aircraft, designated F-7M Sabre- II,, p. 169 would have looked much like the Guizhou JL-9 (or FTC-2000) jet trainer / fighter aircraft. Pratt & Whitney's PW1216, an afterburning derivative of the J52-P-409 turbojet producing of thrust, was also proposed as the Sabre II's engine. Its afterburner was designed in China.\\"Pratt & Whitney's PW1216 turbojet...\\" http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1987/1987%20-%201876.html?search=Sabre%20II Fitting the APG-66 radar was also planned. U.S. objections and termination As the USSR's ending of its involvement in Afghanistan, United States interest in Pakistan lessened. The PAF terminated the Sabre II project after Grumman's warning that it was financially risky and less feasible than other options. Worsening of the US‚ÄìChinese relations after Beijing's suppression of the Tiananmen Square student protests also hurt the project, as U.S. sanctions prevented transfer of American technology to China. Grumman Aerospace withdrew from the project shortly thereafter. At the same time, the US Congress imposed an embargo on economic and military exports to Pakistan when Congressional leaders became aware of Pakistan's atomic bomb program. A panic ensued among Pakistan's military as Pakistan's atomic bomb program impacted the Super-7 project. The US government tolerated Pakistan's atomic bomb program during the 1980s due to a desire for Pakistan's cooperation in defeating the Soviets in the Afghan Soviet war. Once the Soviet forces retreated, Pakistani cooperation was no longer required and military and economic sanctions were imposed on Pakistan under the Pressler amendment in 1990. This prevented F-16 aircraft already paid for by the PAF during the Afghan war from being delivered. Efforts by the PAF to find a replacement failed (see Pakistan Air Force 1990‚Äì2001, the lost decade). Evolution into JF-17 The Sabre-II evolved into the successful development of the JF-17 Thunder, in 2003. The Pakistan Air Force decided on a much less expensive solution for replacement of the F-6, the F-7P Skybolt, an upgraded version of the F-7M Airguard. The F-7P fleet was to be supported by a fleet of over 100 advanced F‚Äì16s from the United States, 40 of which had been delivered during the 1980s. The PAF launched a secretive project, ROSE, to procure as many second-hand Dassault Mirages from various countries as possible and upgrade their electronic systems. In March 1990 it was reported that after being rejected by the PAF, Sabre II had been superseded by the Super 7 and China was considering continuing its development. The American arms embargo had forced the PAF to come up with innovative solutions to keep all its combat infrastructure operational.Sheikh, PAF, Air Marshal Rashid (2001). The story of the Pakistan Air Force, 1988-1998 : a battle against odds. Pakistan: Shaheen Foundation. p. 432. . The PAF hired Russia's Mikoyan Group as consultants, and design studies for the project began at the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex. In 1995, Pakistan Air Force decided to resume the program and quickly reached out to China. Memoranda of Understanding were reached between Pakistan and China towards developing new aircraft to fill the role of the Super 7. This led to the successful development of the JF-17 Thunder, introduced in 2003.

It has a single runway in length, paved with asphalt. Once a major stop on commercial trans-Pacific airline routes, today the airport is for emergency use. Construction During World War II, Canton Island (Gilbertese spelling Kanton Island) was considered part of the British-controlled Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony. A low, narrow rim of land surrounding a large, shallow lagoon, at its widest to the west, the atoll is 4¬Ω miles, narrowing to the east over a distance of just . The airfield was built on the island's northwestern point between 1938‚Äì39 by Pan American Airways as a stopover on their route from Hawaii to New Zealand. The Pan American pioneered the central air route of Hawaii to the Philippines and Asia, by way of stations at Midway, Wake and Guam passed through the Japanese controlled islands with serious concerns about its safety growing in 1941 even as the Army had reinforced the Philippines with a flight of B-17 bombers by way of Midway, Wake and Port Moresby in September. The War Department approved a plan with orders effective 4 October 1941 to build an alternate air ferry route skirting the mandated islands and capable of handling planes such as the B-17s. While a commercial firm was engaged for most of the island stops of the new route, the Canton airfield was under construction by a team of Army Engineers and civilian contractors with a target opening of bomber capability by January 1942. The effort began on 3 November with a transport carrying 130 troops and civilian contractors and towing four barges of equipment departed Honolulu arriving at the island 14 November after losing two of the barges. By 28 December, despite considerable difficulties, the field was declared suitable to accommodate heavy bombers. On 31 January 1942 garrison forces for the island, then codenamed \\"HOLLY,\\" sailed from San Francisco. The political status of the island was uncertain at first, with American and British settlers occupying two separate camps on the island. On March 3, 1938 President Franklin Roosevelt placed Canton and Enderbury Island under jurisdiction of the United States Department of the Interior, but this claim was strenuously resisted by the British government. In April 1939, Canton and Enderbury were placed under joint British and American control for fifty years, and \\"thereafter until such time as it may be modified or terminated by mutual consent\\". World War II Pacific & Adjacent areas key air ferry route (1942)The airport was used as a military airfield during World War II by the United States Army Air Forces in 1942 and 1943, initially being used by the 40th Ferrying (later Transport) Squadron, Ferrying (later Air Transport) Command as an airfield for moving combat aircraft to forward combat units. The airfield saw various aircraft, including A-20s, B-17s, B-24s, B-25s, B-26s, P-38s, P-40s, C-46s, and C-47s transit the base. In February 1943, the long-range B-24 Liberator Bombers of the 392d Bombardment Squadron were sent to the airfield. The Imperial Japanese Army did not invade Canton, although the airfield was bombarded on 1 November 1943 by the Japanese submarine I-36. After the war, it was returned to civilian control. After the war Canton Island airport continued to see use during the 1950s as a trans-Pacific stopover for DC-4, DC-6B and DC-7C aircraft for Pan Am, British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines, Qantas and Canadian Pacific Airlines, but with the advent of long-range jet aircraft during the 1960s, their need for the island faded, and the airfield and its associated facilities were ultimately abandoned in 1965. It saw occasional use thereafter in conjunction with subsequent U.S. government projects on the island (largely related to the human spaceflight program, in particular Project Mercury and Project Gemini), but with the abandonment of these endeavors, the airport was finally closed for good in 1975, although Air Tungaru used it as an occasional refueling stop on its Tarawa-Kiritimati-Honolulu route well into the 1990s. It remains available as an emergency landing field.

Founded in 1938, it currently produces three festivals per year, attracting some 110,000 visitors annually taking place since 2004 primarily at the Lucerne Culture and Congress Centre (KKL) designed by Jean Nouvel. Each festival features resident orchestras and soloists alongside guest performances from international ensembles and artists, in 2019 including the Berlin Philharmonic, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, Vienna Philharmonic, Bernard Haitink, Anne-Sophie Mutter and Sir Simon Rattle.  History  The festival started with the so-called \\"Concert de Gala\\" in the gardens of Richard Wagner's villa at Tribschen in 1938 conducted by Arturo Toscanini, who had formed an orchestra with members of different orchestras and soloists from around Europe. With the rise of the Nazi regime several major performers and conductors, including Toscanini, Fritz Busch, Adolf Busch, and Bruno Walter decided not to perform in the traditional German and Austrian music festivals such as the Bayreuth Festival and Salzburg festival. In the 1940s the Swiss Festival Orchestra (Schweizerische Festspielorchester) was founded from members of the elite Swiss orchestras, which became a central part of the festival known since 1943 as the Internationalen Musikfestwochen Luzern (IMF). In 2000 it was renamed as the Lucerne Festival and is currently part of the European Festivals Association.  The Summer Festival  The largest festival is the Summer Festival (Lucerne Festival im Sommer), taking place in August und September and featuring over 100 events. Since 2003 it has been launched by the Lucerne Festival Orchestra, Claudio Abbado's \\"orchestra of friends\\" consisting of internationally acclaimed soloists, chamber musicians, teachers, and members of the Mahler Chamber Orchestra, as well as of the Filarmonica della Scala; since 2016 its music director has been Riccardo Chailly. Also founded in 2003 was the Lucerne Festival Academy, which was established by the French composer and conductor Pierre Boulez to bring together young musicians from around the world to perform music of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Wolfgang Rihm has been Artistic Director since 2016 and from 2016 to 2018 Matthias Pintscher worked with him as Principal Conductor. International artists are also invited to be artistes √©toiles and composers- in-residence. The Summer Festival is organized around an annual theme; recent topics have been \\"Identity\\", \\"Childhood\\" and \\"Power\\". Alongside the resident orchestra and academy, three additional institutions contribute further to the festival's annual activity. Lucerne Festival Young is responsible for programming classical music performances to youngsters, including \\"Young Performance\\" (2014-2017). Lucerne Festival Alumni is a network that represents musicians who have graduated from the Academy since 2003 and supports them as they launch their careers and organize performances of contemporary classical music around the world.  Other Festival Activities  The Easter Festival (Lucerne Festival zu Ostern) was founded in 1988 and took place each spring over a nine-day period two weeks before Easter and lasting until Palm Sunday, with a special focus given to sacred music. Performances were held in churches throughout Lucerne, as well as in the KKL and included annual guest performances by the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra and Choir. Additionally, Bernard Haitink together with the Lucerne Festival Strings led annual master classes for young conductors. The Easter Festival was ended after the 2019 edition. The Piano Festival was founded in 1998 and took place every November over a nine-day period. It showcased keyboard virtuosos and emerging stars in a mixture of recitals, orchestral concerts, and chamber music. The ancillary \\"Piano Off-Stage!\\" program presented a series of jazz events in a range of Lucerne's bars and restaurants. The Piano Festival was ended after the 2019 edition. Lucerne Festival Ark Nova is an inflatable mobile concert hall, developed by Arata Isozaki and Anish Kapoor in 2011 to contribute to the cultural reconstructions taking place in Japan following the earthquake, tsunami and resulting nuclear disaster at Fukushima. Starting in 2020, and replacing the Easter and Piano Festival, Lucerne Festival inaugurated a new series of extended musical weekends, one each in the spring and the fall, which focus on distinguished artists or which investigate specific thematic contexts. These special weekends involve unusual programming concepts and event formats. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the inaugural Spring Musical Weekend, which was to have focused on the artistry of Teodor Currentzis and his musicAeterna ensembles, had to be canceled.

In the early days of the LDS Church, members were asked to gather together many times in specific locations from all over the world, including traveling across the United States to the Utah Territory. In the modern era, members are asked to gather in the stakes of Zion located in their local areas. Doctrine In order for gathering, a scattering has to take place. In the Old Testament, Israel had the blessings of being God's covenant people, but they were scattered because of rebellion. God promised that the Children of Israel would be gathered. Missionaries are sent by the LDS Church worldwide to gather the children of God. Peter and Paul prophesied that all things were to be restored during this last dispensation, which includes gathering the scattered. Latter-day Saints are taught that one of the main purposes for gathering is to make all of the saving ordinances available, especially those that are limited to a temple.  Historic examples  LDS percentage of US population by county in 2000 Historically the Latter-day Saints have gathered in many locations, including: * Kirtland, Ohio * Independence, Missouri * Nauvoo, Illinois * Salt Lake City and the surrounding Salt Lake Valley * Various sites within the Mormon Corridor * Laie, Hawaii  Modern practices  In the modern era, members are asked to gather in the stakes of Zion in their local areas. The members of the LDS Church gather with their local ward or branch for weekly worship services in LDS meetinghouses. Twice a year there is a stake conference for each stake, where the members of the several wards that make up each stake meet as a group. These were previously held in stake tabernacles, but now normally will occur in stake center. District and area conference also happen periodically. Latter-day Saints gather twice each year for General Conference, currently held in the Conference Center, but available by satellite broadcast to many LDS meetinghouses, via BYUtv, and other broadcast outlets. In many high schools throughout the United States, many LDS students gather for release time Seminary to learn more about the teachings found in the Standard Works. In many colleges throughout the world, students gather together to take institute classes which teach these same topics at a collegiate level.

The service is currently contracted to Quality Line. History The route has roots from the London Country route 468 which was introduced in May 1946 in time for the first post-war Epsom Derby, which went from what was then Chessington Zoo to Effingham via Epsom Hospital. It was renumbered 467 in 1999 after London suffix lettered bus routes were renumbered; 68A became London Buses route 468, so the 468 became the 467, which had previously been used as a London Transport country route between Horton Kirby and Sidcup. In early 2005, it was suggested that the route be merged with the K4, providing a service between Epsom Hospital and Kingston Hospital. This did not go ahead as a result of a lack of funding from Surrey Council, a lack of buses small enough to operate the route (the K4 uses small low-floor buses whereas the 467 uses double-deckers), an inability to cope with the school appendages on certain 467 journeys, and difficulty finding a suitable route through Hook, Mansfield Park and Winey Park. In 2006, the route was considered for withdrawal by Transport for London but was saved after it attracted additional funding from Surrey County Council. Certain journeys on the route carry on to Epsom Hospital for Rosebery School. In addition, since 2009 the 467 has covered the journeys of the discontinued 833 Surrey service from Hook to Hinchley Wood School (which like the 467 was contentiously considered for withdrawal in 2006 but unlike the 467 was actually withdrawn that year), making it the only route to contain school-hour extensions at both ends of the route. It is also the only link between Chessington and Epsom that does not necessitate a change at Tolworth or Surbiton, which would result in an additional journey time and expense, as a second bus must be boarded in order to continue the journey. This can be attributed to the fact that in April 1965 the Borough of Epsom and Ewell opted not to become part of Greater London. Although a link from Chessington to Epsom only runs once an hour, it has been suggested that the London Buses route 71 be extended from Chessington to Epsom via the B280 road, providing a more direct and frequent service between the two.

In 2014, SAGES added the Fundamental Use of Surgical Energy (FUSE) program designed to teach the entire surgical staff about the safe use of surgical energy-based devices in the operating room, endoscopy suite and other procedural areas.  Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS)  FLS is a comprehensive web-based education module that includes a hands-on skills training component and assessment tool designed to teach the physiology, fundamental knowledge, and technical skills required in basic laparoscopic surgery. The goal of the program is to provide surgical residents, fellows and practicing physicians an opportunity to learn the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery in a consistent, scientifically accepted format; and to test cognitive, surgical decision-making, and technical skills, all with the goal of improving the quality of patient care. Initially developed as an optional program, comprehensive research on the effects of FLS on practicing surgeons lead the American Board of Surgery adopted FLS completion as mandatory for all applicants for board certification as of the 2009-2010 academic year.  Fundamentals of Endoscopic Surgery (FES)  The FES program is a comprehensive educational and assessment tool designed to teach and evaluate the fundamental knowledge, clinical judgment and technical skills required in the performance of basic gastrointestinal endoscopic surgery. The goal is to provide participants with an opportunity to learn the fundamentals of endoscopic surgery in a consistent, scientifically accepted format, and to test cognitive and technical skills. Like FLS, FES certification is required by the American Board of Surgery as part of their Flexible Endoscopy Curriculum as of the 2017-2018 academic year for applicants seeking ABS certification.  Fundamentals Use of Surgical Energy (FUSE)  FUSE is an educational program consisting of an interactive web-based multimedia-enhanced didactic curriculum and an online multiple choice cognitive exam. The program is being designed to certify that a successful candidate has the demonstrated knowledge fundamental to the safe use of surgical energy-based devices in the operating room, endoscopic suite and other procedural areas in order to prevent fires and burns to patients. The FUSE program was conceived after multiple studies indicated a knowledge gap between surgical staff and the use of energy devices which affected safety in the OR.

In 1926 Oshanin was commissioned by the Soviet government to prepare a study of the \\"daily life and anthropological type of Uzbek women.\\" Oshanin's research team interviewed and physically examined several hundred Uzbek women from Tashkent. Oshanin died in Tashkent in 1962 and is buried in Botkin cemetery in Tashkent. Oshanin‚Äôs daughter, Helen Lvovna May, subsequently worked and taught at Tashkent University.

Constructed in 1826 by Russel Gallup, the farmhouse was built with a colonial center chimney design with Federal style details that has been modernized to the early 20th century without significantly changing the floor plan. Named after the apple orchards planted by Russel Gallup, Applewood Farm developed significantly under the ownership of Everett Gallup, the last member of the family to own the property. The property was later owned by Arlene Meyer Cohen and a 40-acre parcel was sold off in November 1984. After the Betz family became the owners it was added to the National Register of Historic Places and operated as a bed and breakfast through the 1990s. In 1987, the property included five contributory structures, the farmhouse, corn crib, barn, silo and chicken coop. The property also has one non-contributing structure, a machinery shed from the 1960s.  History  The farmhouse was built by Russel Gallup in 1826 before the incorporation of the town of Ledyard in 1836. Gallup served as a member of the Connecticut Militia in the War of 1812. He would hold the office of deacon for the Ledyard Congregation Church for over fifty years. The property was split as a deed to his second son, Rufus Gallup in 1855 and ownership passed upon Russel Gallup's death in 1869. Rufus Gallup took the same approach with his son, Russell Gallup II, and split the property in 1877. Russell Gallup II was a teacher and became a Judge of Probate from 1896 until his death in 1911. Everett Gallup took over the farm in the 1920s and was the last member of the Gallup family to own the farm. The property was later owned by Arlene Meyer Cohen. A 40-acre parcel of the original property was sold to Sarter in November 1984. The house was acquired by the Betz family, who sought to operate the farmhouse as a bed and breakfast. Betz owned the farmhouse at the time of its nomination to the National Historic Register in 1987. Applewood Farm operated as \\"Applewood Farms Inn\\", serving as a six- guest room bed and breakfast through the 1990s. In 2005, the property was sold from Applewoods Estates LLC  Construction  Built around 1826 by Russel Gallup, the two-and-a-half-story Applewood Farm's farmhouse design harkens back to the earlier colonial center chimney design with Federal style details. and The National Register of Historic Places nomination form states that the house's construction may have been influenced by an earlier house built on the opposite side of Colonel Ledyard Highway, but there is no evidence for that design, but notes that it was a retardetaire example. The farmhouse is feet long and . Around 1842 a by one-and-a-half-story wing was added to the east side. The rear ell, a one-and-half-story structure measuring by , connects to a by shed. The house and its additions are all topped with gable roofs and were using wooden shingles at the time of its historic nomination in 1987. The farmhouse has six fireplaces, with those on the first floor are made of cut granite blocks also with granite hearthstones and the second floor are made of brick with granite lintels with brick hearths. The house has had modernization throughout the years, including modernizing the kitchen and bathrooms that has not significantly altered the floor plan. The hardware in the house was modernized and updated over the years, but had reproduction colonial hardware and early 20th-century hardware at the time of its nomination. Some changes, like the installation of a new door in 1986 were done specifically to meet fire code regulations. Contributing to the property is a by corn crib that has been previously rebuilt and dated to around the 19th century at the time of its nomination. The barn, a post-and-beam construction, is long and with large double doors on the east and west sides. The rafters were made with a single planed side and the \\"rest is left round\\". Attached to the barn is an early 20th century dairy shed measuring long by wide. Other contributing assets include a in circumference silo and a by , both likely built in the early 20th century. A machinery shed dating to the 1960s was specifically listed a non- contributory asset. In 1987, the listed property had out of the original farm.  Importance  Applewood Farm has served as a farm for over a century, with an 1850 census reporting it produced butter, cheese, rye, Indian corn, oats, wool, Irish potatoes and hay. Three apple orchards planted by Russell Gallup would become an important part of Applewood Farms and owe its name to those orchards. After Everett Gallup took over the farm in the 1920s, the farm produced fresh fruits and vegetables and poultry, eggs and dairy products. In 1994, the Applewood Farm reported having 700 trees tapped for maple syrup production and showed visitors the process of producing the syrup. Applewood Farms was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 under criteria A for the Gallup family history that played an important role in the local history and under criteria C as an architecturally important example of a late colonial center chimney house.

It occurs in every mainland state, as well as New Guinea. In dry conditions, the fast-growing grass can become a tumbleweed. Description Hairy panic is a perennial grass that reaches high. The leaves have tubercle-based hairs and are up to long by wide. The seed spikes are typically long, with the spikelets long. Taxonomy Prolific Scottish botanist Robert Brown described Panicum effusum in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. It still bears its original name. Ferdinand von Mueller described Panicum convallium, which he recorded from the banks of the Torrens and Gawler Rivers, on the Murray River and along the Flinders Ranges, in 1855. Common names include branched panic, hairy panic, effuse panic, native millet and poison panic. Distribution and habitat Found across Australia, particularly in the east and Papua New Guinea, hairy panic occurs on low- to medium-nutrient clay soils over shale or conglomerate. Its large range, abundance and stable population mean that hairy panic is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, and in fact may be becoming more abundant. ‚ÄúHairy panic‚Äù is found on the following ecoregions in Australia: Shrubland, grass downs, tropical savanna, desert, woodlands, lowland rainforest, tropical rainforests, montane grasslands, sub- alpine grassland, mangroves, xeric scrub and temperate rainforests. Ecology Panicum effusum produces a dry, single-seeded, indehiscent fruit which is eaten by the stubble quail. The seeds are wind-borne, though can also be transported in mud on cars. The flowering of this plant occurs during summer. It is highly drought-tolerant, but is sensitive to frost. Under extremely dry conditions, the fast-growing grass becomes a tumbleweed (that has evolved to disperse seeds) and can become a nuisance in residential areas due to the accumulation of grass stalks. In February 2016, the town of Wangaratta, Victoria, was invaded by large numbers of tumbleweeds of the plant, which piled up to roof height in places. Some residents blamed the problem on a local farmer who had failed to upkeep his paddock. Hairy panic uses C4 carbon fixation, giving it an advantage in conditions of drought and high temperature. Uses Hairy panic is a component of pastures, though not usually abundant. It is of moderate nutritional value to livestock. Sheep consuming large quantities of hairy panic within 2‚Äì6 weeks of rain can suffer from photosensitivity and the fatal disease ‚Äúyellow-bighead‚Äù. It also has some bush food value. The seeds can be ground and baked. Although there are plenty of seeds they may not be easy to collect. https://www.anbg.gov.au/apu/plants/panieffu.html See also * Kali tragus, a common species of tumbleweed in the United States References http://plantnet.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/cgi- bin/NSWfl.pl?page=nswfl&lvl;=sp&name;=Panicum~effusum External links * * effusum Category:Poales of Australia Category:Flora of Queensland Category:Flora of New South Wales Category:Flora of Victoria (Australia) Category:Flora of South Australia Category:Flora of Western Australia Category:Flora of the Northern Territory Category:Tumbleweeds ","title":"Panicum effusum"},{"id":"26927888","text":"The Bakerton Group is the eponymous first full-length studio album by instrumental psychedelic rock band The Bakerton Group.

It is notable for the musical acts showcased onscreen, being the film debut of Sonny & Cher in particular. It is one of the few films in the genre to be filmed in black and white. Although some sources state that the film was also released under the title Beach House Party, to date no prints or posters have surfaced with such a title. Plot Co-ed Lee Sullivan (Sherry Jackson), a student at an unnamed California college, inherits a house on the beach from her late uncle. She wants to use the building as a boarding house for girls, thus both alleviating the student housing shortage and financing her education. Meanwhile, Adam Miller (Frankie Randall) plans to turn the beach house into a boys' boardinghouse, claiming that he received permission to do so while Lee's uncle was still alive. Adam secretly files first for an off- campus housing permit, and the boys take up residence in the house. Lee also receives a permit, and naturally, problems develop when both male and female students decide to co-habitate ‚Äì this administrative mix-up also makes for much ducking and dodging of the university authorities. In spite of being at odds with each other, a romance blossoms between Lee and Adam.

AIP would later hire Dexter to direct Maryjane and The Mini- Skirt Mob. Dexter has said that casting Sonny and Cher was the idea of Fred Roos. While promoted as a standard beach party film with posters showing most of the female stars in bikinis and a title song with the lyrics \\"...only two steps down to the nearest wave, and surf's up every night!\\", no one in the cast actually wears swimsuits in the film, nor do any of them do anything on the beach ‚Äì except walk on it ‚Äì fully clothed. In fact, Frankie Randall, the male lead, wears a windbreaker on top of his shirt for most of the film. Although little surfing is shown in the film apart from a few random insert shots of extras on surfboards, the \\"surfing coordinator\\" for Wild on the Beach was Phil Sauer, who had also worked on AIP's Muscle Beach Party and Bikini Beach (both 1964); Beach Blanket Bingo and How to Stuff a Wild Bikini (both 1965); as well as Columbia's Ride the Wild Surf (1964). This was also the second time Dexter used the Boulder, Colorado-based surf band The Astronauts. Music * Jimmie Haskell composed the score and co-wrote two songs; associate producer \\"By\\" Dunham received a writing credit for six songs in the film. * Frankie Randall performs two songs, \\"The House on the Beach\\" and \\"The Gods of Love\\" (both written by Bobby Beverly and By Dunham). * The Astronauts perform four songs in the film: the rockabilly \\"Rock This World\\" (written by Beverly and Dunham), and the three surf tunes \\"Little Speedy Gonzalez\\" (written by Stan Ross and Beverly), \\"Pyramid Stomp\\" (written by Haskell and Dunham), and \\"Snap It\\" (written by Haskell) * Sonny & Cher (backed by The Astronauts) sing \\"It's Gonna Rain\\" (written by Sonny Bono), and Jackie & Gayle sing \\"Winter Nocturne\\" (written by Eddie Davis and Dunham). * Cindy Malone sings \\"Run Away from Him\\" (written by Beverly and Dunham); Russ Bender sings the country & western song \\"Yellow Haired Woman\\" (written by Eddie Davis and Dunham); and Sandy Nelson performs \\"Drum Dance\\" (written by Joe Saraceno and Frank Warren).

It was built following the Ashland dam break of February 1886 which washed away the previous bridges. The bridge served the millyard of the Ashland Cotton Company, in the Jewett City section of Griswold. The bridge was long and crossed a millrace on a skew angle. The Ashland Mill was damaged by arson in March 1995 and subsequently torn down, but the bridge itself remained. By 1999, the town deemed the bridge unsafe and closed it, and by February 1999, the bridge was moved to a vacant parking lot and was replaced with a new bridge. The bridge was added to the state of Connecticut historic register and it was later added to the National Register of Historic Places in April 1999. It was removed from the National Register in February 2016.  Construction  Heavy rains in February 1886 caused the Ashland dam to break and the resulting flood damaged the Ashland Cotton Company's buildings and washed away the previous bridges at the site. and The Berlin Iron Bridge Company was contracted to build a total of three bridges in the area, the Ashland Mill Bridge, another larger lenticular truss for Ashland Street and another bridge for the Slater mill which was located further downstream. Clouette and Tinh note that the mill owners may have been influenced in their decision by the Berlin Iron Bridge Company's bridges that were already in place in the surrounding area. The Ashland Mill Bridge was a single-span lenticular pony truss bridge. Completed in 1886, it was a roadway from Ashland Street to the millyard. The bridge was made of four long panels, totaling in length. The roadway was wide. The bridge's wrought-iron truss was deep and it crossed the river at a 28¬∞ angle. All but the truss's joints were pinned except for the endposts' lower-chord nut connections; as was distinctive of the Berlin Iron Bridge Company's bridges. The plate-girder floor beams supported wooden stringers and floored with planks across the width of the bridge. The bridge's railing were made of two 5/8-inch (1.5875 cm) rods bolted to the inside of the trusses. A 1905 postcard depicts the bridge being painted red, but the paint was nearly absent by 1998.  Fate  Pachaug River millrace at Ashland Mill In March 1995, the manufacturing buildings were damaged by arson and were subsequently demolished. The site became a town park and the bridge was anticipated to be rehabilitated and serve as a pedestrian bridge in the park. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in April 1999 for being a historically significant example of late 19th-century bridge fabrication and as a surviving example of a bridge built by the Berlin Iron Bridge Company without significant modification or deterioration. It was also locally significant as a remaining artefact of the Ashland Cotton Company, formerly a major employer in the city. In 1999, the town closed the bridge as it was deemed unsafe and badly deteriorated. It was estimated that $72,000 would be needed to relocate the bridge. In February 1999, an eight-member committee was tasked with planning a municipal park on the site. First Selectman Paul Brycki, hoped that the pending nomination to the National Register of Historic Places would help obtain grant money to repair the bridge. Prior to February 1999, the historic bridge was moved to a vacant parking lot near the town hall and a replacement bridge was installed. The bridge was also on the state of Connecticut's historic register list.

P√¢que is noted as the youngest ever main performer to appear at Eurovision and her age, together with that of the same year's Israeli singer Gili Natanael (who was 12 years old), caused much controversy and adverse comment from other participating nations, with representations to the European Broadcasting Union that a minimum age restriction needed to be introduced to prevent child performers being put forward for an adult contest. The EBU agreed, and with effect from the 1990 contest no performer was allowed onstage who would not be at least 16 years old by the last day of the year in which the contest was held. The rule has remained in place ever since, so P√¢que's record stands.  At Eurovision  On the night of the final P√¢que performed 15th in the running order, following Finland and preceding Spain.

Johan Peter Weisse (13 August 1832 ‚Äì 7 March 1886) was a Norwegian philologist. Personal life He was born in Fluberg as a son of physician Joachim Frederik Weisse and his wife Grethe Fleischer. His grandfather had migrated to Norway from Brandenburg. The family moved to Trondhjem in 1833. He married his own cousin Maja Stang (1843‚Äì1916) in July 1863 in Fredrikshald. She was an aunt of engineer Olaf Stang. In May 1893 one of their daughters married politician Gabriel Gabrielsen Holtsmark. Through them, Weisse was the maternal grandfather of professor Johan Peter Holtsmark, professor Anne Holtsmark and painter Karen Holtsmark. Career He took his examen artium at Trondhjem Cathedral School in 1850. He read languages such as Norse, Anglo-Saxon, Gothic, Old Danish, Old Swedish, Greek, Latin, Russian and Cuneiform script already at that time, as witnessed by his diary Litter√¶r Dagbog. He started studying philology in 1851. From 1853 to 1855 he had to stay in Rome because of health issues, but he studied the city vividly. He was a part of a Nordic intellectual group here, which included Julius Middelthun, Christoffer Borch, Georg Forchhammer and Niels Ravnkilde. He finally graduated from the Royal Frederick University with the cand.philol. degree in 1858. In October 1858 he was hired as co-editor (together with Nicolai Mejdell) of the newspaper Christiania-Posten. He is remembered for writing political and satirical commentary, and a 25-piece series between July 1859 and January 1860 on Italian history and society, marking himself as a supporter of Camillo Cavour. In early 1861 Weisse was hired as teacher at Trondhjem Cathedral School. He stayed here until September 1865, when he changed to Fredrikshalds l√¶rde og realskole. From June 1874 to April 1875 he worked at Christiania Cathedral School, and from April 1875 he was an inspector at Aars og Voss School. In November and December 1875 he held trial lectures for the position as professor at the Royal Frederick University, and he was appointed on 23 December in competition with Jan Johanssen. He was a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters from 1879. He continued as professor until his death, and also held numerous popular lectures. His obituary in Dagbladet read that Weisse wanted to \\"form men and not mere objects for examination\\". He contributed \\"significantly\\" to Marius Nygaard's textbooks on Old Norse, first published in 1871. In 1871, Weisse released his own Latin grammar, Latinsk Grammatik til Skolebrug, but it was considered too difficult for school students, and was out-competed by Emil Schreiner's Latinsk Sprogl√¶re. The dominating Latin-Norwegian dictionary was later released by Schreiner, Nygaard and Johanssen. Schreiner sat on the committee that hired Weisse as professor in 1875. Weisse died from a stroke in March 1886. He was buried at V√•r Frelsers gravlund.

Background The film follows authors Chris Haw and Shane Claiborne, co-founder of the Potter Street Community (formerly The Simple Way) of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on their Jesus for President: Politics for Ordinary Radicals book tour. Claiborne and Haw began their 23 city, 11,000 mile journey in June 2008 on a refurbished school bus fueled by used vegetable oil. Before starting the book tour the crew attended the P.A.P.A (People Against Poverty and Apathy) Festival in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which is a gathering of Christian community oriented individuals who use a combination of music, workshops, and Bible studies to discuss issues concerning community, theology and peacemaking. The Festival is organized entirely by volunteers and is funded completely by donations. Next the crew stopped at the Zondervan headquarters followed by the first stop of book tour at megachurch Mars Hill Bible Church, where Rob Bell is the head pastor. The tour continued through the United States and Canada, stopping at several other cities and churches. Summary The tour takes place during the 2008 U.S. presidential elections which becomes a topic of discussion for Claiborne and Haw while touring. After a speaking engagement in Pittsburgh Claiborne tells CNN during an interview in regards to the following of young evangels that the movement and tour has attracted:\\"This is not about going left or right, this is about going deeper and trying to understand together. Rather than endorse candidates, we ask them to endorse what is at the heart of Jesus and that is the poor or the peacemakers and when we see that then we'll get behind them\\". The documentary discusses Christianity from the standpoint of social justice advocacy and outreach. Claiborne and Bell are considered to be part of the new emerging church movement. This movement which emphasizes following Jesus through non-violence, love of enemy and caring for the poor is also known as New Monasticism. New Monasticism communities, where Claiborne himself is a member, can be identified by 12 \\"marks\\". Claiborne explains that:\\" The marks show the common threads that connect Christian communities that might otherwise be seen as scattered anomalies, rather than vibrant cells of a body\\". The tour expresses the beliefs of this movement and received acknowledgments from many respected individuals and scholars in the fields of Theology and Christian left thinking. Theologian and activist, Ron Sider stated:\\" The book and tour's decided mix of social justice and Christian outreach form a new wave for evangelicals in the U.S.\\" Sider is the Professor of Theology, Holistic Ministry and Public Policy at Palmer Theological Seminary in Wynnewood, Pa., and founder of Evangelicals for Social Action. As the film continues viewers are introduced to a variety of people advocating social justice. One of these individuals is Sister Margret Mckenna, who is the founder and director of New Jerusalem Now. This organization, located in North Philadelphia, is a recovery option for addicts that offers community style living and treatment for their addictions. Mckenna credits the success of the program to the community environment individuals are given when choosing New Jerusalem, the community forces individuals to change their behavior ‚Äî\\"and changing behavior is key to recovery. In these medical models of recovery, there's no community obligation, you're just a patient. The day they get out, they use. I've heard that I don't know how many times.\\" Other featured interviews include pastor, author, sociologist, and public speaker Tony Campolo and author Becky Garrison. Claiborne and Haw challenge tradition thinking about Christianity and in an excerpt from their book state: ‚ÄúThis is not a set of political suggestions for the world; this is about invoking and embodying the alternative. All of this is an invitation to join a peculiar people- those with no king but God, who practice jubilee economics and make the world new. This is not the old-time religion of going to heaven; this is about bringing heaven to the world.‚Äù Featuring The film features and contains interviews with * Shane Claiborne * Chris Haw * Jim Wallis * Brian McLaren * John M Perkins * Brooke Sexton * Rick Perlstein * Sr. Margaret McKenna * Logan Laituri * Zack Exley * Aaron Weiss * Becky Garrison * Lisa Sharon Harper * Leroy Barber Festivals The Ordinary Radicals was screened in various film festivals including Pocono Mountain Film Festival], where it was nominated for best documentary in 2009, the Fallbrook Film Festival in Bonsall, California, the Crossroads Film Festival in Jackson, Mississippi, the Garden State Film Festival, the Ion Film Festival in Dubai, UAE, the Alcolade Film Awards, the Flickerings Film Show Case, the Hobokeben Film Festival, and the Okanagan Film Festival in Kelowna, BC.

The concept of souls include both the souls of the living and the souls or ghosts of the dead. The concepts of souls in the Philippines is a notable traditional understanding that traces its origin from the sacred indigenous Philippine folk religions.Mercado, L. N. (1991). Philippine Studies Vol. 39, No. 3: Soul and Spirit in Filipino Thought. Ateneo de Manila University. Souls in a general concept=Souls of the living Each ethnic group has their own concept and number of the soul of a being, notably humans. In most cases, a person has two or more souls while they are alive. The origin of a person's soul have been told through narratives concerning the indigenous Philippine folk religions, where each ethnic religion has its unique concept on soul origin, soul composition, retaining and caring for the soul, and other matters, such as the eventual passage of the soul after the person's life is relinquished. In some cases, the souls are provided by certain deities such as the case among the Tagbanwa, while in others, the soul comes from certain special regions such as the case among the Bisaya. Some people have two souls such as the Ifugao, while others have five souls such as the Hanunoo Mangyan. In general, a person's physical and mental health contribute to the overall health of the person's souls. In some instances, if a soul is lost, a person will become sick, and if alll living souls are gone, then the body eventually dies. However, there are also instances where the body can still live despite the loss of all of its souls, such as the phenomenon called mekararuanan among the Ibanag. Overall, caring for one's self is essential to a long life for the souls, which in turn provide a long life to the body.Gaverza, J.K. (2014) The Myths of the Philippines. (Undergraduate Thesis).

Philippine Studies Vol. 39, No. 3 (Third Quarter 1991), pp. 287-302 Souls of the dead Ghosts or ancestral spirits, in a general Philippine concept, are the spirits of those who have already passed away. In other words, they are the souls of the dead. They are different from the souls of the living, where in many instances, a person has two or more living souls, depending on the ethnic group.Mercado, L. N. (1991). Philippine Studies Vol. 39, No. 3: Soul and Spirit in Filipino Thought. Ateneo de Manila University. In some cases, when the body dies, the souls that have been lost eventually re-combine in the afterlife such as the case among the Bukidnon. In other cases, the last main soul travels to the afterlife alone such as the case of the Suludnon, while in other cases, the soul eventually goes back to its region of origin such as the case among the Bisaya. In a unique case among the Bagobo, their right soul goes to the afterlife, while the left soul becomes a creature called busaw.Mercado, L. N. (1991).

Each ethnic group in the Philippine islands has their own terms for ancestral spirits or souls of the dead.Mercado, L. N. (1991). Philippine Studies Vol. 39, No. 3: Soul and Spirit in Filipino Thought. Ateneo de Manila University. Due to the sheer diversity of indigenous words for ghosts, terms like espiritoMercado, L. N.

M., Javier, J. R. (2013). Tabi-Tabi Po: Situating The Narrative of Supernatural in the Context of the Philippines Community Development. Manusya: Journal of Humanities. Unlike in Western beliefs where ghosts are generally known for their sometimes horrific nature, ghosts of the dead for the various ethnic groups in the Philippines are traditionally regarded in high esteem. These ghosts are usually referred to as ancestral spirits who can guide and protect their relatives and community. Although ancestral spirits can also cast harm if they are disrespected.Mercado, L. N. (1991). Philippine Studies Vol. 39, No. 3: Soul and Spirit in Filipino Thought. Ateneo de Manila University. In many cases among various Filipino ethnic groups, spirits of the dead are traditionally venerated and deified in accordance to ancient belief systems originating from the indigenous Philippine folk religions.McCoy, A. W. (1982). Baylan: Animist Religion and Philippine Peasant Ideology. University of San Carlos Publications. Popular urban legends about Filipino ghosts usually include the theme of either a white lady, a phantom hitchhiker, or a headless ghost. In most instances where ghosts are harmful, Christian themes have been incorporated, as ghosts in the traditional Filipino folk religions are generally not harmful unless provoked.de Vera, E., Luci, C.

The concept of soul(s) is integral to all ethnic groups in the Philippines. Each ethnic group has their own unique concept of what a soul is, how many are there, and how a soul follows the cycle of life and death or how it follows the linear path of life, death, and beyond. Among the many concepts of soul/s are as follow:Myths of the Philippines; Gaverza, J.K., 2014, University of the Philippines Diliman *Ifugao ‚Äì a person has two souls, one located in the eyes, the other in a person's breath; the withdrawal of the eyes soul causes illness, while the withdrawal of the breath soul causes death; souls of murdered victims go to the lowest level of the skyworld *Ibaloi ‚Äì a soul is believed to formally rest on the summit of Mount Pulag, which is a traditional sanctuary for departed loved ones *Kalinga ‚Äì the souls of the dead roam around earth during 10‚Äì11 in the morning and 2‚Äì3 in the afternoon; the other hours of the day and night are reserved for the living *Tagalog ‚Äì the soul, called kaluluwa, can leave the body involuntarily; the soul is called a kakambal when the person is alive; the kakambal travels once a person is sleeping; this soul-travelling is one of the causes of nightmares, when the soul encounters a terrifying event; the kakambal transforms into the kaluluwa when the person dies; it then travels or gets delivered by the sacred buwayas (crocodiles with coffin-like backs) of the god, Buwaya, to the underworld, either in Maca (for good souls, ruled by Sitan and Bathala) or Kasanaan (for sinful souls, ruled by Sitan); during specific times of the year, the kaluluwa may enter the mortal world easily during pangangaluwa rituals *Ilokano ‚Äì there are four soul systems; the first is kadkadduwa which is the ‚Äúinseparable partner‚Äù and ‚Äúconstant companion‚Äù; the second is kararma is a person's natural vigor, mind, and reason which can be lost when one is frightened; the kararma can also be stolen and must be retrieved back as failure to regain kararma will lead to insanity; the third is aniwaas which left the sleeping body to visit familiar places; a person who wakes up before the return of aniwaas may lose it and become insane; the last is araria which is the liberated soul of the dead who visits relatives and friends in the mortal world *Ibanag ‚Äì the body is called baggi while the soul is called ikaruruwa; the Ibanags believe that the soul's purpose is to give direction and wholeness to a person, but a person can survive even without a soul; without a body, the soul can also experience material wants and needs; a phenomenon called mekararuanan is unique to the Ibanag where the soul leaves the body but without sense *Hanunoo Mangyan ‚Äì an individual, whether human or not, is believed to possess 2‚Äì5 other souls, which the Hanunoo Mangyan believe to be the explanation for miraculous recoveries, their dreams, or individual reactions to startling sounds and movements; a human soul is called a karaduwa tawu, while other animal souls differ per species, namely karaduwa manok (chicken soul), karaduwa baboy (pig soul), karaduwa kuti (cat soul), and karaduwa hipon (shrimp soul). *Bisaya ‚Äì the soul, called dungan, can be taken by bad spirits; souls can also be imprisoned in a sacred spirit cave guarded by Tan Mulong, who has a spirit dog with one mammary gland and two genitals; sickness is believed to be the temporary loss of the dungan, while death is its permanent loss; old tradition says that before inhabiting the body of an unborn being, a dungan first lives in a special region, home to other dungans; the dungan is fragile from usog (unintentional transfer of disturbing vapors of a strong body to a weak one by proximity), and thus, must be nurtured and strengthened through time and rituals; once a person dies, the dungan flies to its upperworld region of origin to await another unborn body to become its avatar; in another story, the soul (probably of a sinful person), upon death, is sent to the underworld; the soul of the dead remains forever in Kasakitan, the lowerworld, unless if a living relative or friend offers sacrifices for redemption towards Pandaque (Pandaki), the god of second chances and messenger of Sidapa, goddess of death; a soul that stays in Kasakitan is kept by Sisiburanen as slaves and after years of staying in the underworld sub-realm of Kanitu-nituhan without redemption sacrifices being offered, the souls are fed to the sub-realm's giant gate guardians, Simuran and Siguinarugan *Karay-a and Hiligaynon ‚Äì the Ilonggo peoples, which includes the Karay-a and the Hiligaynon peoples, call the soul as dungan, which cannot be seen; it can voluntarily come out of the body to take in the form of insects and small animals, notably when a person is sleeping; if the body is badly treated, the dungan leaves; the soul's lifespan on earth is measured by the god of death, Sidapa, using a sacred magical tree which grows sturdy on Mount Madia-as (Madyaas); the soul may be saved through the aid of Pandaki, the god of second chances and loyal friend of Sidapa who occasionally visits Mount Madia-as *Sulodnon ‚Äì the soul is called umalagad; the soul is watched over by three divine brothers; the first brother is Mangganghaw, who keeps track over a person's affairs after marriage, including pregnancy, where he visits the house of a laboring mother to peep and see if the child was born; the second brother is Manglaegas, who, after having the reports of Mangganghaw, enters the house to see the child to make sure the child is alive; the last brother is Patag‚Äôaes, who, after getting the reports from Mangganghaw, waits until midnight to enter a house and have a sacred conversation of life and death with the infant; if someone eavesdrops, the infant dies through choking; the sacred conversation revolves around on how the infant wants to live and the infant's preferential way to die; the infant always gets to choose his or her death preference; after the conversation, Patag‚Äôaes uses a measuring stick, computes the infant's life span, and leaves the house; once a person dies, the soul travels to an anthill near the deathbed; around the anthill, the stream Muruburu appears, where the soul removes its funeral vestments and bathes in its lake to remove the scent of incense called kamangyan; after changing clothes, the souls goes into a journey into Lima‚Äôawen; in that realm, the soul faces Bangla‚Äôe, who ferries the soul across the realm until it arrives in the stream Himbarawen, which has a bridge guarded by Balagu; the soul afterwards travels to the entrance of Mount Madia-as (Madyaas) until it reaches a cockpit, where the soul's relatives welcome it; cockfight betting, feasts, and dressing is made; if the soul is underdressed, it will haunt its living relatives for negligence; after the feasts, the soul is brought to a rest house where it waits for a ritual to restore its body in the lowerworld *Waray ‚Äì the soul of the dead is said to be guided by the god Badadum, who gathers the souls of the newly dead to meet their relatives and friends at the mouth of a river located in the lowerworld; old stories say that souls eventually lead to a sacred cave in the interior of Samar island *Tagbanwa ‚Äì the true soul is called the kiyaraluwa and is different from the five other secondary souls; the true soul is given to each infant by the god Magindusa when the nose of a child emerges from the vulva; the secondary souls are located in the hands, feet, and the head below the air whorl (‚Äò‚Äôpuyo‚Äô‚Äô) of the hair; the specific soul at the puyo is not properly aligned and must be re-aligned by a shaman to prevent illnesses caused by its non-alignment; the soul at the puyo has a material form similar to a round white stone; the soul of the dead travels into a cave entrance to the underworld; it then meets its ruler Taliyakud, who tends a fire between two sacred tree trunks; a sinful soul is burned while a good soul passes onto a happier place where food is abundant; a soul may die seven times in the underworld, with each death the soul goes deeper into its realms; the soul is buried in the underworld by insects and lizards when it dies there; if the soul dies seven times, it is reincarnated into an insect such as a fly, dragonfly or dung beetle; if the insect reincarnation is killed, the soul disappears into oblivion *Bukidnon ‚Äì the soul, called makatu, exists before a child's birth but is separate from the body; a special crib for the makatu is established prior to the child birth; the deity, Miyaw-Biyaw, breathes seven makatu into a person; with the withdrawal of each makatu from a body, the weaker a person becomes; if all makatu withdraws from a body, the individual dies; upon death, all seven makatu combine into one and journeys into Mount Balatucan for final judgment; the soul first travels to the huge rock, Liyang, which is followed by a journey to Binagbasan, where the Tree of Records grows. After making a mark on the tree, the soul journeys to Pinagsayawan, where the soul must dance and sweat for atonement; the next journey is to Panamparan, where the soul gets a haircut to be presentable at Kumbirahan, where a banquet awaits the soul; the god Andalapit then leads the soul to the foot of Mount Balatucan, where the gods of the dead assemble to judge the soul; good souls are sent to Dunkituhan, the cloud capped stairway that leads into heaven at the summit of Balatucan; an evil soul is sent to a river of penance for atone until forgiven; souls at the river sweat blood, the source of the river's color and fishy scent; a forgiven soul afterwards also goes into Balatucan's summit *Bagobo ‚Äì there are two souls called gimokud; the right hand gimokud is the good soul that manifests as a shadow on the right hand side of the path while the left hand gimokud is the bad soul that manifests as a shadow on the left side of the path; if the right soul leaves the body, it notifies the person in an insect form; if the left soul leaves, it causes effects such as shivers, depending on the place where it travels; upon death, the left soul transforms into a busaw, a monster that digs up dead bodies; all larger animals have two souls as well, but smaller birds, bees, insects, and inanimate objects only have one soul; the souls of inanimate objects directly go to the underworld to serve its previous owner; the right hand soul travels to the underworld by passing a black river and arriving at a town ruled by Mebuyan, who is both goddess and priestess in the underworld; the soul bathes itself, and once contented, becomes unwilling to return to the earthworld In the arts Souls have been featured multiple times in films, but most feature ghosts whose context are influenced by Christian or Western views, rather than traditional beliefs from the indigenous Philippine folk religions. Some of these films include Feng Shui (2004), Wag Kang Lilingon (2006), Shake, Rattle and Roll X: Class Picture (2008), The Healing (2012), and Seklusyon (2016).Fernandez, C. M. (2019).

To do so, on 10 May 1921 the Pozna≈Ñ Airline Society Aerotarg was established. The committee allocated 5 million Polish marks to finance this venture. Aerotarg began cooperation with a haulage company from Danzig - Danziger Luftpost which subsequently leased six Junkers F 13 aircraft to the newly created airline. The airline operated its first flight on 29 May, on the day after the opening of the fair, and ceased operation on 16 June. The Polish Post used the airline to send airmail and issued a special series of stamps to allow for it.http://www.stampdomain.com/country/poland/aerotarg/ Altogether the airline carried out 58 flights on the Pozna≈Ñ-Warsaw route and 30 flights between Pozna≈Ñ and Danzig.

Lutz was the first American woman to die in combat during World War II and, with the exception of Civil War era Dr. Mary Edwards Walker, the highest decorated woman in the history of the U.S. military. Early life Picture of young Lt. Aleda E. Lutz Lutz was born November 9, 1915 in Freeland, Michigan to German immigrants Friederich Georg Lutz and Margaretha Sybilla (n√©e Hitz) Lutz from Nuremberg, Germany. Lutz grew up bilingual, a native English and German speaker, which would later make her an asset during World War II. Quite prophetically, Aleda Lutz's name respectively means \\"winged\\" \\"famous warrior.\\"Navarro, Yvonne (2006) First Name Reverse Dictionary: Given Names Listed by Meaning Lutz was the youngest of 10 children and grew up on a farm that would become the Freeland POW Camp and later part of the MBS International Airport, formerly known as the Tri-City Airport, that was built due to fears that the Detroit Airport, where combat aircraft were being built, could be a target for bombing. The Lutz family belonged to St. John Lutheran Church-Amelith and helped minister to the German POWs who were housed at the Freeland POW Camp. During World War I, most of the Lutz family was forced to register as German and report to county court. This was a time in which many Americans were angry and suspicious towards German-Americans, and during the course of the war the government registered nearly half a million \\"enemy alien\\" civilians.https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/us-confiscated-half- billion-dollars-private-property-during-wwi-180952144/ The combined family experiences of registering as \\"enemy aliens\\" during WWI and being forced to sell their land during WWII would give Lutz a special connection to Japanese- Americans participating in the war effort, particularly the 442nd Infantry Regiment (United States). Lutz attended Wellman Country School through the 8th grade and Freeland School through the 10th grade. In 1933 she graduated from Saginaw Arthur Hill High School. In 1937 Lutz graduated from Saginaw General Hospital School of Nursing. Aleda Lutz was a superior athlete; she especially liked tennis, dancing, and ice skating. History also indicates that Lutz was an avid bowler. She began bowling while attending nursing school. As an activity for the nursing students, a local bowling center, Hessie Lanes, gave the students the opportunity to bowl at a reduced rate. Lutz was active in the Saginaw Women's Bowling Association, which was founded in 1937.Massman, Emory (1999) Hospital ships of World War II Lutz was not alone in her military service to her country: her brother Adam fought in WWI, her brother Conrad joined the medical division during WWII, her nephews Theodore and Frederick joined the U.S. Army during WWII and her nephew Robert joined the peace- keeping force in Germany after WWII. World War II Aleda became a staff nurse at Saginaw General Hospital, but with the advent of World War II, she began looking for a way to contribute to the massive war effort. She enlisted in the Army Nurse Corps on February 10, 1942 and was commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant. Her army service number was N730648. Freeland POW Camp on the former Lutz farm Aleda spent her early months as a general duty nurse in the Station Hospital at Selfridge Field, in Mount Clemens, Michigan. Early letters describe her living quarters, her work at the base, and her thoughts about the service. In one letter she said she the only nurse on duty and had 25 patients. Furthermore, she expected the work load to increase as more nurses were being sent overseas. Lt. Aleda E. Lutz with a small dog All nurses in at Selfridge Field were asked to volunteer for duty as an Air Evacuation Nurse if they could pass the pilot's physical. Only two percent of 59,000 nurses in World War II were qualified flight nurses. World War II had given rise to the first female flight nurses in the U.S. military. Just 6 of 22 nurses who applied passed the physical. Three of the six dropped out of the program. Only Lutz and two others, Clara Murphy and Veronica Savinski, were assigned to be flight nurses. On December 17, 1943, Aleda was promoted to 1st Lieutenant. Lutz was transferred to the 802nd Medical Air Evacuation Squadron of the United States Armys 12th Air Force, the first to depart for overseas duty. They were activated and sent to North Africa. The 802nd was a Medical Air Evacuation Squadron, the first unit of its kind. This highly classified unit consisted of C-47 cargo planes which flew to the battlefront with ammunition and supplies and then took wounded-emergency cases back to the hospitals. It should also be noted that these planes flew without the Red Cross insignia. She was first sent to Sarasota's Morrison Field in Florida. She and the other nurses were looking forward to spending the winter in the sunny south, but before their curriculum was in place, the unit was activated. In January 1943, the three nurses were en route to an oversees assignment as part of the evacuation squadron sent into active duty. It appears that they received their training on the job, in the middle of a war zone. Lt. Aleda E. Lutz Aleda was in the 1st landing in Africa and on every American operation that went on around there. Lutz participated in six separate battle campaigns over a 20-month period, accompanied air combat missions, and conducted all-weather medical evacuations in Tunisia, Italy and France. In June 1943, Aleda wrote that she was both amused and sometimes embarrassed at the attention she and her fellow nurses received from the soldiers. Oftentimes, Aleda and her fellow nurses were the first American women the soldiers had seen in six to eight months. It seemed the soldiers were all eager to talk to an American girl. The 802nd had gone farther into the combat zone than any other medic unit with nurses. Realizing what it would probably be like, Aleda wondered what the future had in store for her. They said that Lutzy, as she was called by her friends, tried to win the war all by herself. When the weather wasn't fit for humans and the overcast was so heavy a bird couldn't navigate, Lt. Lutz would fly. Any place a pilot would fly, Lt. Lutz would fly. People said when the weather was terrible, and the C-47s bounced around and sank into air pockets and thrust their way through the nasty fronts of mountain country, at those times Lt. Lutz was calmest and at her best. Not one of the 3500 she helped evacuate died under her hand. Through this demonstration of her value as a flight nurse, she soon became one of the best liked members of the unit. An army nurse colleague recalls, \\"Aleda was the most wonderful person - everyone loved her. She was full of wit and humor. She was the best nurse I ever came in contact with - before or after the war.\\" Lt. Lutz helping patients off an airplane. As a flight nurse, Lutz flew in unmarked transport planes, which were used to carry supplies to front lines and transport patients backing out, making them legal targets for enemy fire. She once made four sorties in a single day onto the Anzio beachhead flight-strip while it was still under shell fire from the German army. On November 1, 1944, she was fatally injured in a Medevac C-47 crash near Saint-Chamond, Loire, France. The Medevac was transporting 15 wounded soldiers (6 German POW and 9 American soldiers) from Lyon, France to a hospital in Italy when the plane crashed. The official explanation was that a violent storm was encountered. The pilot lost control of the plane and it crashed on the side of Mont Pilat (Crest de la Perdrix) in Massif central, at the south of Saint-Etienne and Lyon. There were no survivors. Lutz was 28 years old, and the only female on the plane. It is believed that Lutz volunteered for that flight, despite the perilous conditions. Lutz was one of only 16 American military females to die in combat in World War II. At the time of her death, Lutz was perhaps the most experienced flight nurse in the U.S. military service. She had the most evacuation sorties (196), most combat hours flown by any flight nurse (814) and the most patients transported by any flight nurse (3500+).Iskra, Darlene (2010)Women in the United States Armed Forces: A Guide to the Issues (Contemporary Military, Strategic, and Security Issues) Lutz was buried with full military honors in the Rhone American Cemetery and Memorial in Draguignan, France. General Mark W. Clark and Major General Thomas B. Larkin both attended her funeral. Lutz is the only woman buried there. Honors and legacy Lutz is one of the most highly decorated women in the United States Military. Lutz was awarded the Purple Heart, the Air Medal with four Oak Leaf Clusters, the European‚ÄìAfrican‚ÄìMiddle Eastern Campaign Medal, and the Red Cross Medal. Lutz earned six battle stars: Tunisia, Sicily, Rome-Arno, Southern France, and North Apennines.Iskra, Darlene (2010)Women in the United States Armed Forces: A Guide to the Issues (Contemporary Military, Strategic, and Security Issues) Stele near Doizieux France Lutz was the first army nurse to receive the Distinguished Flying Cross (posthumously, from President Franklin D. Roosevelt), Lutz was the second woman to receive the decoration (after Amelia Earhart), awarded for distinguished performance in an aerial flight. It reads as follows: For extraordinary achievement‚Äîthroughout her long period of service, 1st Lt. Lutz distinguished herself through superior professional skill and courage. Her selfless devotion to duty and outstanding proficiency have reflected the highest credit upon herself and the armed forces of the United States. Her resourcefulness and determination have been on high inspiration those serving with her.Congressional Record: Proceedings and Debates of the 79th Congress, Volume 91, Part 12 USAHS Aleda E. Lutz On April 3, 1945, at the insistence of General George C. Marshall, Lutz was honored with an 800-patient future hospital ship the USAHS Aleda E. Lutz. The Aleda E Lutz was the largest mercy ship afloat and was the former French liner Colombie. On February 13, 1945, Aleda E. Lutz was designated a U.S. Army hospital ship in accordance to international practice, as set forth in the provisions of the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. The Aleda E. Lutz Nursing Award was given annually by the Saginaw General Hospital's Nursing School from 1945 until its closing in 1969. When women war veterans of Saginaw County organized their own American Legion Post No.544 after the war, it was also named for Aleda. In July 1945, Aleda's sister Hilda Lutz, a Saginaw General Hospital nurse, was a special guest at the Detroit Municipal Airport where the army air force was presented with an $80,000 check from the Women's International Bowling Congress for a new C-47 airplane to be named Miss Nightingale III, in Aleda's honor. Grave of Lt. Aleda E. Lutz (Rhone American Cemetery and Memorial) To carry on her legacy, her family and members of the Women's International Bowling Congress joined together to lobby Congress to pass a bill that allowed medical hospitals to be named in honor of women. The effort to rename the facility after Lutz, who was an athlete in bowling and half a dozen other sports, continued to be recognized by women bowlers. They responded to a request at the 1990 WIBC's annual meeting to stir up national support for renaming the center. The vast majority of Saginaw citizens thought the hospital was already named after Aleda Lutz‚Äîafter all, it was dedicated in her honor in 1950 and again in 1988‚Äîbut it was never officially recognized by Congress. In fact, the congressional resolution was first offered in 1949, but died in committee because she was a woman. WIBC delegates spread the word that legislation needed to be approved by Congress before the center could officially be named after Lutz. By writing letters and telephoning congressional leaders, they made it happen On October 27, 1990, the Aleda E. Lutz Veterans Affairs Medical Center was rededicated as the Aleda E. Lutz Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center by Congressional Decree. It was the first time a medical facility was congressionally named after a woman. The dedication came 46 years after Aleda's death. There are currently only two VA medical centers named for women In 1993, Lutz was inducted into the Saginaw (Michigan) Hall of Fame and in 1994, she was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in Lansing, Michigan. On Saturday, April 17, 2010 Lutz, along with four other former military members with Michigan connections will be enshrined into the Air Zoo's Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame. A stele (monument) exists at the crash site which states Lt. Lutz was the first American woman who died in action during World War II. The stele is near Doizieux, France on Mt. Pilat. The monument was erected in 2005 and every September there is a memorial service. A local citizen has written a book about the crash and has interviewed all the witnesses. These honors, earned during her lifetime and posthumously, make Lutz the highest decorated woman in the military history of this country with the exception of Civil War Era Doctor Mary Edwards Walker, the sole female recipient of the Medal of Honor.

They succeeded in becoming affiliated to the British Labour Party under the name of 'The Jewish Socialist Labour Party', claiming membership of 3,000‚Äîthough actual membership was a few hundred. One issue that they tried to influence policy on was the northern border of Palestine which was being decided at the San Remo conference.

At the time the British Madate authorities were proposing the setting up of a legislative council. Kaplansky was in favour of supporting the initiative. \\"We should come to an agreement with the Arabs, and together demand the expansion of the parliament's jurisdiction and ultimate self rule.\\" He proposed two assemblies: one of elected representatives which would inevitably have an Arab majority; the second would have equal numbers of Jews and Arabs. He called for cooperation with the Arabs without British supervision and for the establishment of settlements all over the country with a vision of a bi-national state. Ben-Gurion was strongly opposed to these proposals which he called \\"Kaplansky's error\\". He opposed negotiations with Arabs since their leadership was from the \\"effendi\\" ruling class and called for the development of ties with an Arab working class. He wanted the separation of the two people, Arab and Jew, under British supervision with Jewish settlements in concentrations as a prelude to a Jewish State. The Congress rejected Kaplanski's proposals.Lockman, Zachary (1996) Comrades and Enemies. Arab and Jewish Workers in Palestine, 1906‚Äì1948.

In San Fernando, in September 1885, he bought some property from Francisco Torrealba, on a site that was located at the Pichilemu beach. He constructed the Ross Hotel with a European-style design, assigning Evaristo Merino as its administrator. He promoted Pichilemu in cities such as Santiago de Chile. He later constructed the Ross Casino and the Ross Park. They used materials such as stone from Italy, Oregon pine from the United States, and Portland cement.

Simulation of transportation systems started over forty years ago, http://publish.uwo.ca/~jmalczew/gida_5/Pursula/Pursula.html and is an important area of discipline in traffic engineering and transportation planning today. Various national and local transportation agencies, academic institutions and consulting firms use simulation to aid in their management of transportation networks. Simulation in transportation is important because it can study models too complicated for analytical or numerical treatment, can be used for experimental studies, can study detailed relations that might be lost in analytical or numerical treatment and can produce attractive visual demonstrations of present and future scenarios. To understand simulation, it is important to understand the concept of system state, which is a set of variables that contains enough information to describe the evolution of the system over time.Sokolowski, J. A., & Banks, C. M. (2009). Principles of modeling and simulation: A multidisciplinary approach. Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley. System state can be either discrete or continuous. Traffic simulation models are classified according to discrete and continuous time, state, and space.Jorge Laval, Ph.D, Assistant Professor, Georgia Tech, Lecture Notes on Traffic Simulation Traffic simulation types Theory=Traffic models Simulation methods in transportation can employ a selection of theories, including probability and statistics, differential equations and numerical methods. * Monte Carlo method One of the earliest discrete event simulation models is the Monte Carlo simulation, where a series of random numbers are used to synthesise traffic conditions.Leemis, L. M., & Park, S. K. (2006). Discrete-event simulation: A first course. Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Pearson Prentice Hall. * Cellular automata model This was followed by the cellular automata model that generates randomness from deterministic rules. * Discrete event and continuous-time simulation More recent methods use either discrete event simulation or continuous-time simulation. Discrete event simulation models are both stochastic (with random components) and dynamic (time is a variable). Single server queues for instance can be modeled very well using discrete event simulation, as servers are usually at a single location and so are discrete (e.g. traffic lights). Continuous time simulation, on the other hand, can solve the shortcoming of discrete event simulation where the model is required to have input, state and output trajectories within a time interval. The method requires the use of differential equations, specifically numerical integration methods.Zeigler, B. P., Praehofer, H., & Kim, T. G. (2000). Theory of modeling and simulation: Integrating discrete event and continuous complex dynamic systems. San Diego: Academic Press. These equations can range from simple methods, such as Euler's method, to higher order Taylor's series methods, such as Heun's method and Runge-Kutta.Chapra, S. C., & Canale, R. P. (2006). Numerical methods for engineers. Boston: McGraw-Hill. * Car-following models A class of microscopic continuous-time models, known as car-following models, are also based on differential equations. Significant models include the Pipes, intelligent driver model and Gipps' model. They model the behavior of each individual vehicle (\\"microscopic\\") in order to see its implications on the whole traffic system (\\"macroscopic\\"). Employing a numerical method with a car-following model (such as Gipps' with Heun's) can generate important information for traffic conditions, such as system delays and identification of bottlenecks. Systems planning The methods noted above are generally used to model the behavior of an existing system, and are often focused around specific areas of interest under a range of conditions (such as a change in layout, lane closures, and different levels of traffic flow). Transport planning and forecasting can be used to develop a wider understanding of traffic demands over a broad geographic area, and predicting future traffic levels at different links (sections) in the network, incorporating different growth scenarios, with feedback loops to incorporate the effect of congestion on the distribution of trips. Applications in transportation engineering Traffic simulation models are useful from a microscopic, macroscopic and sometimes mesoscopic perspectives. Simulation can be applied to both transportation planning and to transportation design and operations. In transportation planning the simulation models evaluate the impacts of regional urban development patterns on the performance of the transportation infrastructure. Regional planning organizations use these models to evaluate what-if scenarios in the region, such as air quality to help develop land use policies that lead to more sustainable travel. On the other hand, modeling of transportation system operations and design focus on a smaller scale, such as a highway corridor and pinch-points. Lane types, signal timing and other traffic related questions are investigated to improve local system effectiveness and efficiency. While certain simulation models are specialized to model either operations or system planning, certain models have the capability to model both to some degree. Whether it is for planning or for systems operations, simulations can be used for a variety of transportation modes. Roadway and ground transportation Map displaying the results of simulating pedestrian traffic at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum site, based on modeling by the Louis Berger Group Ground transportation for both passenger and goods movement is perhaps the area where simulation is most widely used. Simulation can be carried out at a corridor level, or at a more complex roadway grid network level to analyze planning, design and operations such as delay, pollution, and congestion. Ground transportation models can include all modes of roadway travel, including vehicles, trucks, buses, bicycles and pedestrians. In traditional road traffic models, aggregate representation of traffic is typically used where all vehicles of a particular group obey the same rules of behavior; in micro-simulation, driver behavior and network performance are included so that complete traffic problems (e.g. Intelligent transportation system, shockwaves) can be examined.http://www.microsimulation.drfox.org.uk/intro.html Rail transportation Rail is an important mode of travel for both freight and passengers. Modeling railways for freight movement is important to determine the operational efficiency and rationalize planning decisions.Assad, Arjang A., (1979). Models for rail transportation. Transportation Research Part A: General Volume 14, Issue 3, 205-220. Freight simulation can include aspects such as dedicated truck lanes, commodity flow, corridor and system capacity, traffic assignment/network flow, and freight plans that involve travel demand forecasting.http://www.freight.dot.gov/fmip/models/library.htm Maritime and air transportation Maritime and air transportation presents two areas that are important for the economy. Maritime simulation primarily includes container terminal modeling, that deals with the logistics of container handling to improve system efficiency. Air transportation simulation primarily involves modeling of the airport terminal operations (baggage handling, security checkpoint), and runway operations. Other In addition to simulating individual modes, it is often more important to simulate a multi- modal network, since in reality modes are integrated and represent more complexities that each individual mode can overlook. Inter-modal network simulation can also better understand the impact of a certain network from a comprehensive perspective to more accurately represent its impact in order to realize important policy implications. An example of an inter-modal simulator is Commuter developed by Azalient which introduces both dynamic route and mode choice by agents during simulation - this type of modeling is referred to as nanosimulation as it considers demand and travel at a finer level of detail than traditional microsimulation. Simulation in transportation can also be integrated with urban environment simulation, where a large urban area is simulated which includes roadway networks, to better understand land use and other planning implications of the traffic network on the urban environment. Software programs Simulation software is getting better in a variety of different ways. With new advancements in mathematics, engineering and computing, simulation software programs are increasingly becoming faster, more powerful, more detail oriented and more realistic.http://www.its.dot.gov/its_publicsafety/emo/emo.pdf Transportation models generally can be classified into microscopic, mesoscopic, macroscopic, and metascopic models. Microscopic models study individual elements of transportation systems, such as individual vehicle dynamics and individual traveler behavior. Mesoscopic models analyze transportation elements in small groups, within which elements are considered homogeneous. A typical example is vehicle platoon dynamics and household-level travel behavior. Macroscopic models deal with aggregated characteristics of transportation elements, such as aggregated traffic flow dynamics and zonal-level travel demand analysis. Microsimulation Microsimulation models track individual vehicle movements on a second or subsecond basis. Microsimulation relies on random numbers to generate vehicles, select routing decisions, and determine behavior. Because of this variation, it is necessary to run the model several times with different random number seeds to obtain the desired accuracy. There will be a 'warm-up' period before the system reaches a steady state, and this period should be excluded from the results. Microsimulation models usually produce two types of results: animated displays, and numerical output in text files. It is important to understand how the software has accumulated and summarized the numerical results to prevent incorrect interpretation. Animation can allow the analyst to quickly assess the performance, however it is limited to qualitative comparisons. The main indication of a problem that can be seen in an animation is the forming of persistent queues. 'Measures of Effectiveness' (MOEs) may be calculated or defined in a manner which is unique to each simulation program. MOEs are the system performance statistics that categorize the degree to which a particular alternative meets the project objectives. The following MOEs are most common when analyzing simulation models: * 'VMT' (vehicle miles traveled) is computed as a combination of the number of vehicles in the system and the distance they travel. * 'VHT' (vehicle hours of travel) is computed as the product of the link volume and the link travel time, summed over all links. * 'Mean system speed' is equal to VMT/VHT. * 'Total system delay' is one of the most effective ways to evaluate different congestion relieving alternatives and it is usually the MOE that the travelling public notices. Delay can be calculated several ways. Some consider it to be only that delay which is above free flow conditions. Others include the baseline delay which occurs as a result of traffic control devices. Some even include acceleration and deceleration delay, while others include only stopped delay. Other commonly reported metrics from traffic simulation tools include: * Link road section speeds, flow, density, travel time, delay, stop time * Intersection turning volumes, delay, * Journey times * Loop detector records for speed, occupancy, headway, gap * Vehicle trajectories and speed vs. distance plots Comparing simulation results with the US Highway Capacity Manual The output of a microsimulation model is different from that of the US Federal Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). For example, most HCM procedures assume that the operation of one intersection will not be affected by the conditions of an adjacent roadway (with the exception of HCS 2000 Freeways). 'Rubbernecking' and long queues from one location interfering with another location would contradict this assumption. The HCM 2010 provides revised guidance on what types of output from traffic simulation software are most suitable for analysis in, and comparison to, the HCM for example vehicle trajectories and raw loop detector output. Comparison with HCM delay and level of service In the HCM delay is used to estimate the level of service (LOS) for intersections. However, there are distinct differences between the way microsimulation programs and the HCM define delay. The HCM bases its delay on adjusted flow using mean control delay for the highest 15 minute period within the hour. The distinction between total delay and control delay is important. Control delay is when a signal control causes a group to slow down or stop. It's important to look at the software's documentation to understand how it calculates delay. In order to use microsimulation outputs to find LOS, the delay must be accumulated over 15 minute intervals and averaged over several runs with different random seeds. Because the HCM uses adjusted flow, another way to compare delay is divide the simulation input's 15 minute peak volume by the peak hour factor (PHF) to increase the simulation's volume. Comparison with HCM Queues HCM 2000 defines a queue as a line of vehicles, bicycles, or persons waiting to be served by the system in which the flow rate from the front of the queue determines the average speed within the queue. Slowly moving vehicles or people joining the rear of the queue are usually considered part of the queue. These definitions are somewhat relative and can be ambiguous. In most microsimulation programs the queue length cannot exceed the storage capacity for that turn-bay or lane. Overflows into the adjacent link or off the network are usually not accounted for, even though this may affect the results. (If this is the case, a work-around can be to temporarily ignore those effects and extend the network or storage area for the link to include the maximum queue length.)http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/trafficanalysistools/tat_vol3/vol3_guidelines.pdf ReferencesFurther reading * * * * ","title":"Traffic simulation"},{"id":"26928893","text":"Christian Henrik Nicolai Mejdell (21 April 1822 ‚Äì 1899) was a Norwegian mining engineer.

It is the fifth mosque to be built in Taiwan. As of September 2008, the Imam was Abdullah Liu (). History In 1953, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution condemning the Taipei government for its actions and guerilla warfare inside Burma. Finally, an agreement was reached between Taipei, Rangoon, and Bangkok for evacuation of all Kuomintang Irregular forces under command of General Li Mi to Taiwan. Civil Air Transport transported 5,583 Kuomintang soldiers and 1,040 dependents to Taiwan.* Taylor, Jay. The Generalissimo's Son: Chiang Ching-Kuo and the Revolutions in China and Taiwan. . The majority of these guerrilla forces were Muslim and had no place to worship in their new Taiwan home and so they started to raise funds to construct a mosque in 1964. First building The original building of Longgang Mosque was completed in 1967. Built over an area of 1,289 square meters, at first the mosque was very small. But after joining the Chinese Muslim Association, they were able to raise money, including funds from Saudi Arabia, to build a larger mosque. Current building Longgang Mosque To make a bigger mosque, they purchased a plot of land at Longdong Road (ÈæçÊù±Ë∑Ø) in Zhongli. At this US$312,000 initial development stage, only the main prayer hall and basement area of the mosque were built. The mosque building occupies an area of 1,300 square meters and the mosque's main worship area can hold 150 worshippers. At the US$400,000 second development stage, the mosque's minarets, a kitchen, dormitory and shower room were added to the main building. Over time, due to the poor materials used to construct the building because of lack of funds, the mosque quickly deteriorated. After some discussion, a plan to reconstruct the mosque was finally put in place. With financial assistance from inside and outside Taiwan, the first reconstruction project for the mosque began in March 1988 and was completed in January 1989. And in 1995, the second reconstruction was completed again resulting in the mosque in use today. Activities By 2008, the population of Muslim faithful in Zhongli had reached 2,000. On weekends, and during winter and summer vacations, the mosque holds basic courses on Arabic and the Islamic faith to educate children about Islam.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBG3jKqYdx0 Architecture Longgang Mosque prayer hall The Longgang mosque has one prayer hall that can accommodate more than 150 people simultaneously.

The economy is based on the production of coastal salt, oysters, and choros. C√°huil Lagoon is a place suitable for fishing, swimming, and boat travel.  Salt deposits  The production of salt is a very old practice in the area. It is known that the indigenous people extracted salt in a very rudimentary way. Production has increased using modern methods. As of 1978, more than a 60% of the population of C√°huil lives on the proceeds of salt production, in production not related to industrial enterprises. To promote tourism in C√°huil, the Municipality of Pichilemu created the \\"Salt Route\\", that takes the tourists to places where salt is produced. This tour starts in Pichilemu and includes C√°huil, Barrancas, La Villa, El Bronce, La Palmilla, and La Plaza. Along the route are two rural ranches, \\"Oro Blanco\\" and \\"El Bronce\\".  Fauna  At least 46 birds species are found in the C√°huil zone, many of them in danger of extinction. Some of them are the coscoroba swan, brown-hooded gull, and white-necked heron. The area hosts at least seven duck species.

Mount Echigo-Komagatake, along with Nakanodake and Mount Hakkai, is also one of the three great mountains of Echigo, the old name for this area of Niigata Prefecture.  Geography  Mount Echigo-Komagatake lies in central part of Echigo Mountains, a mountain range over Niigata, Fukushima, and Gunma Prefecture. Between late autumn and early spring, large amounts of snow fall in this region because of the monsoon from Siberia, with an average of 3 to 4 meters. Avalanches eroded the surface of the mountain and formed steep precipices, especially on the west and north face. Hikers can see snow on the mountain even in late summer. Thanks to the heavy snowfall, this mountain is the source of several rivers such as the Kitanomata River, the Mizunashi River, and the Sanashi River, which all flow into the Sea of Japan. Such abundant water is used mainly for paddy fields, and hydroelectricity. In contrast to the winter season, summers are hot and humid and there are thunderstorms in the afternoon almost every day during the summer. Hikers must pay attention to hyperthermia and thunderbolts.  Climbing routes  There are several climbing routes to the mountain's peak. The easiest and most popular route is from Shiori Mountain Pass. (Japanese: ÊûùÊäòÂ≥†) Other routes are the Kushigahana route, the Komanoyu route, and the Echigo Sanzan mountain ridge route. All routes are long and demanding, but special technique isn't needed. It's possible to get back to the starting points except for the last one if climbers start in the early morning. The best climbing season is between June and early October.  Transportation  Some bus routes are available from train stations (Muikamachi, Urasa or Koide) to the starting points. However, they are much less convenient than by car and taxi. At the starting points, several dozens of parking lots are available for free, but during the best season, the parking lots are quickly inundated with a lot of cars.  Facilities  There is only one mountain lodge called Komanokoya (Japanese:Èßí„ÅÆÂ∞èÂ±ã) at about 100 meters below the summit. The caretakers stay between late April and the end of October. It costs 2000 Japanese yen to stay there without food, with no reservation. In the snow season, climbers also use the lodge for shelter.

She was built by N.V. Dok en Werfmaatschappij Wilton-Fijenoord, Schiedam. The original intent of her design was to be designated as the freighter Dinteldyk (which was also designed to carry a small complement of passengers). A decision was made to have her redesigned as a liner in 1950, but she still retained the stout hull lines and sturdy machinery of a freighter. The ship played a major role in post-war immigration from Europe making frequent voyages to New York City and the Pier 21 immigration facility in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. In March 1962 Edward & Alex Van Halen, and their parents Jan & Eugenia Van Halen, immigrated to the US aboard the SS Ryndam. In 1973, she was sold to a Panamanian subsidiary of a Greek shipping interest and extensively refitted with her bow line changed, many internal changes, and alterations to her superstructure. This was done to give her a more modern (at the time) 1970s design appearance. In 1988 she was sold to gaming interests and performed short cruises in the Gulf of Mexico under the name Pride of Mississippi, and in 1991 was renamed Pride of Galveston. In 1993, she was docked permanently in Gulfport, Mississippi and became the Copa Casino. When Copa Casino adopted a more permanent structure, a decision was made that she should be scrapped. She foundered off the coast of the Dominican Republic on her way to the ship breakers in Alang, India on 16 March 2003.

Typical uses include teaching penmanship and arithmetic to students. A page of a copy book typically starts with a copybook heading: a printed example of what should be copied, such as a single letter or a short proverb. The rest of the page is empty, except for horizontal rulings. The student is expected to copy the example down the page. By copying, the student is supposed to practise penmanship, spelling, reading comprehension, punctuation, and vocabulary. History The American Instructor: Or, Young Man's Best Companion, published in 1748, was the first American copybook.Tamara Plakins Thornton, \\"Handwriting in America: A cultural history.\\" Page 12. The 1802 book The Port folio recommends the copybook method of learning fine penmanship over the previously used method of \\"engraved models\\", citing the advantage of having the example text closer to the student's reproduction. The author adds, \\"A neat copybook has often laid the foundation, or shown the first symptoms, of taste in all the elegant arts of life.\\"Joseph Dennie, Asbury Dickens, \\"The Port folio\\", 1802. Page 303 Copybooks are still available for purchase today, but unlike older copybooks many modern ones use print and cursive fonts as the writing examples instead of real handwriting. Uses Because in the 18th century good penmanship was primarily considered an important business skill, the copybooks frequently were oriented towards autodidacts wishing to learn business skills, and therefore included chapters on general business management as well as lessons in accounting.Tamara Plakins Thornton, \\"Handwriting in America: A cultural history.\\" Page 12. Other copybooks, however, focused chiefly on writing literacy and used maxims and sometimes Bible verses as their material. It was intended that students memorize not only correct penmanship, but correct morals as well, through exposure to traditional sayings.

It was a vanity label operating under the parent company Priority Records. The label was Marilyn Manson's first vanity label. Posthuman Records is now defunct. Background Posthuman Records was founded in 2000 by Marilyn Manson, frontman of the controversial band of the same name. Posthuman was created as a vanity label under the much larger Priority Records parent company, the American record label that launched the career of N.W.A. Even though Posthuman was his own label, Marilyn Manson remained signed to Nothing Records, the subsidiary of Interscope Records.MANSON LAUNCHES NEW POSTHUMAN LABEL The Posthuman record label is most famous for its one and only signing, Godhead. On January 23, 2001, Posthuman released Godhead's 2000 Years of Human Error album; one of the only two records ever released to carry the Posthuman logo.Godhead, It‚Äôs Not Their Debut For Posthuman Records In addition to Godhead, Posthuman delivered the soundtrack to the film Blair Witch Project 2: Book of Shadows as the first official Posthuman release. Danny Chaotic of American industrial rock band Chaotica also worked with the label, remixing Godhead's cover of the Beatles' popular \\"Eleanor Rigby\\". Chaotica was never physically signed to Posthuman however. In April 2002, it was announced that the record label had come to an end. This left Godhead seeking a new label to sign under as well.MARILYN MANSON's Posthuman Records Closes Its DoorsMarilyn Manson's Posthuman Records label has closed. Posthuman Studios Although there was never a physical Posthuman Studios, there were a number of studios involved in the productions the label released. Godhead's 2000 Years of Human Error album was recorded at Dr. Kevorkian's Lab in Los Angeles, California, which may or may not actually be Marilyn Manson's own studio, the Doppelherz Blood Treatment Facility. It is also possible that Marilyn Manson's cover of \\"Suicide Is Painless\\" featured on the soundtrack to the film Blair Witch Project 2: Book of Shadows was recorded at The Mansion in Death Valley, California, during the recording of the Marilyn Manson's 2000 album Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death). Godhead's 2000 Years of Human Error album was also mixed at Westlake Studios in Los Angeles. Aftermath In a July interview with Outburn in 2003, Manson spoke about Posthuman Records, saying, \\"Yeah [Posthuman Records is gone now], but that was something that was never really Marilyn Manson orientated, because I'm signed to Interscope. . . . Yeah, I found it unsatisfying , because I don't like to try and manipulate somebody else's work into something that is marketable. For me, by nature, I create things that I think people will like, but it's part of my motivation and it's not money driven. Success of reaching people is what drives it. It made me feel like the people I don't like in a lot of ways. It was an interesting experience to try, but I don't feel like it's something that I want to do.\\"OUTBURN ‚Ä¢ MARILYN MANSON \\"The Golden Age Of Grotesque Is A New Way Of Looking At Things\\" In 2010, Marilyn Manson created a second vanity label called Hell, etc., under the parent company Cooking Vinyl.

Raukar was born to an ethnic Croat family in the east Syrmian town of Ruma (today located in Vojvodina, Serbia). She began singing in the school choir in high school in Zagreb. Her professional singer career began accidentally in 1943. One of members of Trio Delinski was ill and there was an urgent need for replacement. Valerija Raukar was literally dragged by her friends into the studio of Krugovalna postaja Zagreb. She sang with Trio Delinski until the end of World War II. Afterwards she continued as a vocal soloist, sometimes making records with dance orchestras. She studied architecture in Zagreb and graduated in 1955. She was married twice. Her first marriage was with known pre-World War II Croatian jazz musician Bojan Hohnjec, who influenced her early singing style. Her second husband was known Croatian jazz musician, drummer Marjan Mo≈°a Marjanoviƒá. In 1960 Rajka Vali moved with her husband to Germany, where she continued her singer career. She also had concerts in France, Spain and Germany. She ended her singing career due to her career as architect.

Bentall, Reconstructing schizophrenia, 1992, page 62 (the long term occurrence of psychosis) and deterioration of the personality. Catastrophic schizophrenia was thought to be the most severe subtype of schizophrenia, as it had \\"an acute onset and rapid decline into a chronic state without remission\\". Catastrophic schizophrenia was also referred to as schizocaria, which was defined by Gerhard Mauz as a psychosis that caused the absolute destruction of the core of one's being. The term \\"catastrophic schizophrenia\\" has fallen out of use due to a number of reasons, including advances in psychiatric treatment, which led to a significant decline in patients that fit the diagnosis as their symptoms did not reach the severity of catastrophic schizophrenia, along with modern refinement of the definition and subtypes of schizophrenia. This term has not been included in any version of the DSM. In modern terms, catastrophic schizophrenia would likely be defined as 'acute-onset chronic schizophrenia with poor prognosis'. History Schizophrenia evolved from Kraepelin's dementia praecox, which was first defined in 1893. Using dementia praecox as a base, Eugen Bleuler defined and differentiated subtypes of schizophrenia at the turn of the century. He stated that catastrophic schizophrenia was characterized by an acute onset of a severe psychosis, followed with little improvement by a severe chronic psychosis lasting until death.Irving B. Weiner, Donald K. Freedheim, George Stricker & Thomas A. Widiger, Handbook of Psychology: Clinical psychology, 2003, page 74 Young adults (aged 16‚Äì25) were at the highest risk of developing catastrophic schizophrenia. It was almost entirely exclusive to upper class and intellectuals. Other risk factors included difficulty adapting to change, individualism, and introversion. E.B. Strauss stated that schizophrenia could come about in two ways: either catastrophically or through a series of 'attacks'. Strauss used catastrophic to refer to schizophrenia that ran a rapidly progressing and continuous course. According to Strauss, catastrophic schizophrenia took a similar course to catatonic schizophrenia and hebephrenia, with all three ending in the total collapse into psychosis within two to four years. Decline Eugen Bleuler found that catastrophic schizophrenia affected 10-15% of people with schizophrenia. However, over time, the number of patients that fit this diagnosis declined significantly. The outcome of a study by Luc Ciompi and Christian M√ºller in 1976 has shown that only 6 percent of patients with schizophrenia were judged to be suffering from catastrophic schizophrenia.George Stein, Greg Wilkinson, Seminars in General Adult Psychiatry, 2007, Page 301Luc Ciompi, Christian M√ºller: Lebensweg und Alter der Schizophrenen. Eine katamnestische Langzeitstudie bis ins Senium (Life and age of schizophrenics. A longitudinal study catamnestic down to senility). Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, New York, NY (USA), 1976 In longitudinal studies begun in the 1930s and ending in the 1980s, Manfred Bleuler (Eugen's son) found the incidences of catastrophic schizophrenia had declined significantly since his father's study. Manfred Bleuler posited that improved hospitals, nursing care, and rehabilitation efforts led to this decline. The decline of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), chlorpromazine, and insulin shock therapy, used extensively in the 1940s and 1950s, could have also played a role in eliminating catastrophic schizophrenia. The term was not included in the DSM-I and is now no longer used, due to changes in how the sub-types of schizophrenia are defined.

Led by singer-songwriter Neil Pennycook, the band's musical style has been categorised as folktronica, alternative rock and indie folk. The band themselves have described their latest work as \\"epic lo-fi\\". The name of the band is a reference to the main character of L'Etranger, the absurdist novel by Albert Camus. Their releases to date have been generally well received by the music and entertainment media, both in Scotland and on a nationwide level. In 2009 The Skinny placed the band's debut album, Pissing On Bonfires / Kissing With Tongues, at No. 16 in their \\"Scottish Albums of the Decade\\" list; while their second full-length release, All Creatures Will Make Merry, has been reviewed favourably by several notable media outlets, among them The BBC, Pitchfork, Bearded, Clash, The List and The Skinny. During 2009 and 2010, the band were included in regular rotation on local and national BBC radio stations, and playlisted by a number of BBC presenters including Gideon Coe, Marc Riley, Vic Galloway and Nemone. They made appearances in many music festivals, including RockNess, T in the Park, Truck, End of the Road and Glastonbury. In May 2013, Meursault's third studio album, Something for the Weakened, was shortlisted for the Scottish Album of the Year (SAY) award. In 2017, they were once again recognised as the album 'I Will Kill Again' was longlisted for that award. The new album 'Crow Hill' is slated for release early 2019. History Neil Pennycook of Meursault performing at Knockengorroch 2010 Meursault were formed when singer-songwriter Neil Pennycook began performing with friends from his hometown of Penicuik, on the outskirts of Edinburgh in Scotland. Pennycook noted, \\"I was into basketball, and only into basketball, until I was 21. I was as passionate about that as I am about music now. But I hurt my knee and had to take six months off, so I started playing guitar. And that was that.\\" In 2006, a then 3-piece Meursault released an EP, Making the Most of the Raw Materials of Futility, via Glasgow indie label Struck Dum Records. The band self-released their debut album, Pissing On Bonfires / Kissing With Tongues, in 2008, before a second run was released on the Edinburgh-based independent label, Song, by Toad Records, in 2009. In 2009, Phillip Quirie and Pete Harvey joined the band, with Pennycook stating that \\"the highlight [of the year] would have to be Phil and Pete joining the band. I‚Äôve followed both of them, in their various projects, for what feels like years, and can‚Äôt believe how lucky I am to have the chance to work them both\\". In 2012, Pennycook elaborated, \\"I was a huge fan of Pete through Khaya, and Desc, and The Leg, and then he came in to do the Cold Seeds album. I told him I really liked his stuff, and he said the same, and he actually asked to join the band. I was quite flattered by that. I got to record with King Creosote that day too ‚Äì I‚Äôd been buying his records since I was at college. That was a good day\\". In late 2009, Neil Pennycook and Peter Harvey contributed to the Cold Seeds collaborative album along with Frances Donnelly (Animal Magic Tricks) and Kenny Anderson (King Creosote). Anderson, Donnelly and Pennycook all wrote songs for the project, which all four performers then recorded together. The band have played numerous concerts in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and in 2009 embarked on their first nationwide tours. In early 2010, the band announced that their first European tour would take place during April and May of that year. The band's second album, All Creatures Will Make Merry was released on Song, by Toad Records as a limited edition handmade CD available to guests at launch events in Glasgow and Edinburgh in early April 2010, prior to a full national release on 24 May 2010. In 2012, the band released their third studio album, Something for the Weakened. It was nominated for the 2013 Scottish Album of the Year (SAY) award. In 2014 the band released a mini-album titled The Organ Grinder's Monkey, which was compiled using a Kickstarter campaign to fund the band's appearance at SXSW in Austin, Texas. In July 2014 after Meursault's south by southwest tour (SXSW), it was announced that they would be officially disbanding. A number of things contributed, but two of the main reasons were that band members had personal family priorities and also because Pennycook wanted to perform as a solo artist. Later that year he released the first Supermoon EP (Supermoon vs Black Friday). Pennycook continued as Supermoon until July 2016, where he then reactivated all of his Meursault accounts and posted \\"Hi\\". Pennycook realised while working as Supermoon that a lot of the themes and music that he was producing was what he'd been doing as Meursault - he had always written and arranged his own music. The major difference in the new Meursault to the previous version of Meursault is that it is now essentially a solo project with a rotating cast of people that perform with Pennycook. A Meursault show alternates between a six piece, or just Pennycook himself. The current lineup is Neil Pennycook, Robyn Dawson, Reuben Taylor, Calum Macleod, Fraser Calder and Jayson Turner. In 2016 Meursault released the Simple is Good EP, and in 2017 released the album I Will Kill Again. In 2017, the album was shortlisted to the Top 10 in the Scottish Album of the Year Awards, as was his previous 2013 album Something for the Weakened. In 2018 Meursault released a digital album Fuck Off Back to Art School & Other Stories, which was part of a year long album campaign. The new album (which was prefaced by Fuck Off Back to Art School & Other Stories), will be called Crow Hill. First making its live debut as part of the Made in Scotland event during the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, it is now slated for release in early 2019. Crow Hill was recorded in Chamber Studio, and co produced by the owner of the studio - Graeme Young. The album was mastered by Mandy Parnell (who has worked with Radiohead, Bjork, The XX), and the artwork is produced by Pablo Clark. The album will be released through Common Grounds Records, a new label established by Graeme Young. This will be the first full length physical album not released by Song, by Toad Records. In September 2018, Meursault released the digital album Archive - a collection of demos & sketches drawn from the first 10 years of Meursault's existence.

Very little of the structure now remains but the site is protected as a scheduled ancient monument. Name Kinneddar shown as \\"Kinedward\\" on a 1730 military map of Moray, also showing the remnants of the sea loch that originally cut the site off from the mainland. The place name Kinneddar comes from two Gaelic elements: cenn, meaning \\"head\\" or \\"end\\", and foithir, probably derived from a Pictish word meaning \\"district\\" or \\"region\\". Although Gaelic in form, foithir is only found in placenames in former Pictish areas of eastern Scotland, where it often refers to high-status areas. The name therefore probably reflects Kinneddar's status as a subsidiary centre of a high-status administrative area, probably centred on Burghead. Location Kinneddar is located on a raised ridge of land originally on the edge of Loch Spynie, with the loch's marshes surrounding the site on three sides. Loch Spynie was a sea loch during the medieval period, stretching 11km from Kinneddar west to Burghead and providing sheltered anchorage for sea-going vessels. Kinneddar was still described as being \\"in a corner of the sea\\" in 1207, but blown sand had cut the loch off from the sea creating a freshwater loch by the 17th century and in the 19th century the loch was drained to its current size. The sandstone ridge between the modern towns of Burghead and Lossiemouth would have been an island during the early medieval period and contained a group of unique and interrelated Pictish sites: as well as the religious site at Kinneddar there was Burghead Fort ‚Äì the largest fortified site in early historic Scotland ‚Äì and the Sculptor's Cave at Covesea, which was important to the Picts as a ritual centre. This area was probably the most important centre of royal power for the Pictish kingdom of Fortriu, which flourished from the 4th to the 9th centuries. History=Pictish monastic site Engraving of thirteen of the Drainie Carved Stones, discovered at Kinneddar in 1855 Kinneddar was one of the major ecclesiastical centres of the Picts, with radiocarbon dating showing activity on the site from the 7th century through to its first appearance in documentary records in the 12th century, and possible activity as early as the late 6th century. The site was surrounded by vallum ditches first cut during the 7th century enclosing an area of 8.6 hectares ‚Äì the largest such enclosure discovered within the territory of Northern Pictland. Within the enclosure there is evidence of significant settlement and industry, including a smithing hearth and evidence of ironworking, and the postholes of large wooden roundhouses. Annex enclosures to the south of the main enclosure and dating to the 11th and 12th centuries suggest that the site grew in size and importance over time. The scale and layout of the site is very similar to that of Iona Abbey, suggesting that the establishment of Kinneddar may have been connected with the church of Columba. Kinneddar was the source of an important collection of carved Pictish stones, the 32 fragments representing parts of ten cross-slabs, three free-standing crosses and at least eight panels from stone shrine-chests. Some of the sculpture is unfinished showing that it was produced on-site. The stones are decorated with patterns including knotwork and ring-headed crosses, but also include several illustrating human figures such as horse-riders and warriors with spears, and one Class I stone decorated with a crescent and V-rod pattern. Particularly significant is the carving on a fragment of a panel representing the biblical King David wrenching open the jaws of a lion. This is similar to the decoration on the more complete St Andrews Sarcophagus from St Andrews Cathedral and is likely to have contained the body or relics of a king or important saint. David was an imperial symbol closely associated with royal power and this iconography indicates that Kinneddar was a focus for extensive royal patronage, perhaps linked to nearby Burghead Fort. The sculpture from Kinneddar is closely linked to that found at the monastic site at Portmahomack, indicating that these two monastic houses may have enjoyed the bulk of royal patronage within the kingdom of Fortriu. The Pictish sculptures found in the vicinity of the castle and kirkyard point to the area being an important 8th century Christian centre (see Culdees) and may have been a principal location for the conversion of the Picts.Oram, Moray & Badenoch, p. 98 Kinneddar Kirk Within the area of the earlier monastic enclosure stood the ancient Kirk of Kinneddar. At least two shrines existed within the kirk between the 8th and 10th centuries, probably containing one or more saint's relics. One of these may have been the oratory or cell with a \\"stone bed\\" established at Kinneddar by the early medieval saint Gervadius, according to the 16th century Aberdeen Breviary. Kinneddar was adopted as the cathedral of the Diocese of Moray by Richard de Lincoln while he was Bishop of Moray between 1187 and 1203, following the move of the bishop's seat from Birnie. In 1207/8 the seat of the diocese moved again with Spynie being confirmed as the cathedral of Moray by Pope Innocent III. Although Kinneddar ceased to be a cathedral it remained important within the diocese, and charter evidence shows that it was the site of the bishopric's charter ceremonies on at least six occasions between 1226 and 1328, and was the site of the signing of a diocesan memorandum during the bishopric of Alexander Bur (1362‚Äì1397). Gothic tracery was added to the kirk during the bishopric of Archibald between 1252 and 1298, and when the Bishop's Palace was abandoned its tower was used by the kirk as a belfry. The parish of Kinneddar was merged with that of Ogstoun to form the new parish of Drainie on 17th February 1669. The kirk at Kinneddar went out of use in 1676, with stone from Kinneddar being used to construct the new kirk at Drainie. Although the foundations of the kirk at Kinneddar were recorded as still being visible in 1760, by 1792 only \\"vestiges\\" remained. Bishop's Palace Bishop Archibald enlarged or rebuilt the castle in c. 1280 and it continued to be used by the bishops until the late 14th century.Royal Commission on the ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland, Archaeological Notes: Canmore ID 16459Cramond, Records of Elgin, pp. 16-7\\\\. Cramond cites the primary source, the Registry of Moray where Bishop Bur arrests a ship on 7 June 1383 in the tidal Loch Spynie delivering cargo to the burgesses of Elgin. Bur was sailing from his residence at Kinneddar Castle to the church of Urquhart. The palace was attacked and burned by Robert the Bruce and David de Moravia in 1308, but was repaired and recorded as the residence of Bishop Alexander Bur in 1383. The palace remained the head of the barony of Kinneddar until 1451, when all nine baronies held by the Bishops of Moray were combined into a single barony headed by Spynie, and from 1462 Bishop David Stewart may have used stone from the now-redundant palace at Kinneddar in his building of the David Tower at Spynie Palace. By 1623 it was being described as palatium dirutum - the \\"ruined\\" or \\"destroyed\\" palace. Nothing now exists of the castle except one fragment of a rubble wall that is integrated into the Kinneddar kirkyard boundary wall.Oram, Moray & Badenoch, p. 122 The ruinous structure still existed in 1734 and was described as being a central tower enclosed by two concentric hexagonal walls which made it unique in Scottish terms.

The art of Herbert Gentry Gentry's paintings juxtapose faces and masks, shifting orientations of figures and heads‚Äîhuman and animal‚Äîinto profiles, to the left, to the right, above and below. The direction of the head, as face or profile, leading right or left, or facing front, is played against the relative scale of each head, its position on the canvas, and in relationship to the others. Herbert Gentry painting in Falsterbo, August 1990 The faces evoke subtle expressions and moods. Rather than using images to depict a concrete story, Gentry releases his experiences upon the canvas. The act of spontaneous painting uses consciousness itself, and each painting reveals the self. When asked about direct influences, he avoids imposing external meanings upon primary experience, describing instead his creative process.Delany, B. K. (2003), \\"Post-World War II Expatriate Painters: The Question of a Black Aesthetic\\". New York: Teachers College, Columbia University. Doctoral dissertation. Philosophically near the jazz musician, Gentry breathes rhythms into a personally inflected expressionism. \\"The staccato beat of jazz is fused with biomorphic form in paintings which never become totally abstract, but hold the picture plane in the Cubist tradition,\\" wrote art historian Peter Selz (1994) about Gentry's work.Selz, Peter, \\"Herbert Gentry\\" essay for gallery exhibition, 1994. Los Angeles, California: Alitash Kebede Gallery. Exhibition brochure. Gentry creates a foil for feelings and for emotion, and orchestrates his subjective figuration in dialogue with the immediacy of the painted gesture. Romare Bearden (1981) wrote that Gentry's \\"method is conceptual rather than realistic. One senses in the chromatic emotionalism, and in the biomorphic forms of the figures that often appear in Gentry's paintings, the strong pull of the unconscious.\\"Studio Museum in Harlem (1982). An Ocean Apart: African American Artists Abroad. New York: Studio Museum in Harlem, October 8, 1982‚ÄìJanuary 9, 1983. Biography=Harlem Renaissance childhood Herbert Alexander Gentry was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on July 17, 1919. He was the son of James Jentry of Madison Courthouse, Virginia, and Violet Howden of Kingston, Jamaica. By 1924 Gentry was living in Harlem, New York City, with his mother and her family. The Harlem Renaissance provided the backdrop for Gentry's childhood. His mother worked as a dancer and actress. Under the name Teresa Gentry, she danced in the chorus with Josephine Baker and Bessye Buchanen. Later, she was in the cast of the original rendition of the Ziegfeld musical Show Boat in 1927, as well as its revival in 1932. His mother's friends included Langston Hughes, Paul Robeson and Duke Ellington. As a youngster Gentry had a role in the play Scarlet Sister Mary, which toured the country with actress Ethel Barrymore and opened on Broadway in 1931.\\"Scarlet Sister Mary\\", IMDb. Gentry took inspiration from artists, musicians, writers, dancers, and actors, all of whom reinforced his belief in the creative world that lay beyond Harlem. Educated in the New York City public schools, Gentry attended Cooper Junior High and George Washington High School. He pursued drawing in school took art classes at the Harlem YMCA and later studied art as part of the under the Federal Art Project of the WPA (Works Progress Administration) at Roosevelt High School. In 1939, the leadership of Harlem protest demonstrations against employment discrimination is said to have included besides Rev. Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.For years, companies such as Con Edison and the New York Telephone Company had resisted hiring African Americans, and only under public pressure and boycott activities did they finally relent in the late 1930s. Andr√©s Torres, Between Melting Pot and Mosaic: African Americans and Puerto Ricans in the New York Political Economy, Temple University Press, 1995, p. 67. Powell led a Tuesday evenings \\"Black Out Boycott\\" of Consolidated Edison electric service to force the utility company to hire blacks in positions above menials. He also staged a billpayers parade to the company's Harlem office, where customers insisted on paying their utility bills in nickels and pennies. ... Nothing worked as well--or dramatized the cause as effectively--as persistent and targeted picketing. ... During 1938 and 1939, Powell's committee achieved breakthroughs with the white-cominated Harlem Chamber of Commerce, which set up employment quotas for 125th Street stores, and with Consolidated Edison and New York Telephone, both of which agreed to employ African Americans for the first time in white-collar positions. \\"Greater New York Coordinating Committee for Employment\\" in Nina Mjagkij, Organizing Black America.

Protester Gentry, who was studying business at New York University, is said to have been Consolidated Edison New York's first Black employee in a white-collar position and to have tolerated being told by company directors to the effect that, \\"If you do well, we'll hire others.\\"Attestation unable to locate He served in the U.S. Army (1942‚Äì45), serving in the 90th Coast Guard Artillery / Anti-Aircraft Regiment working in Special Services. His U.S. Army Service in World War II took him to different countries in the Mediterranean and Northern Europe: Morocco, Algeria, Madeline Island (Italy), Corsica, Marseilles, Paris, Alsace- Lorraine (France), and Salzburg (Austria). At the end of the war, Gentry was stationed in the Paris suburb of Crepy-en-Vallois. He took every opportunity to visit Paris.Kirwin, Liza (1991), \\"Oral history interview with Herbert Gentry\\", Archives of American Art, May 23, 1991. Washington, D.C.: Archives of American Art Smithsonian. The expatriate yearsParis, 1946‚Äì58= The center of the Art World before World War II, Paris still held that title in 1946. Paris touched other memories for ex-soldier Gentry, who as a youth had heard many of his mother's friends speak of their travel and performances in Paris. Home in Harlem after his discharge from the Army, he wanted to study art in Paris. Not waiting for the administration of the GI Bill to be organized in Paris, and warned that the basic amenities were still rationed, Gentry arrived for the Fall 1946 academic term. His first year back in Paris, Gentry resided at the American House at the Cit√© Internationale Universitaire de Paris, where he met fellow American students: sculptor Kosta Alex, pianist Julian Ketcham, and writers Marc Behm and Dan Kurzman. Moving beyond student circles, he sought out author Richard Wright, who encouraged him in his art; he got to know writer James Baldwin. Gentry studied French at the Alliance Fran√ßaise, and was enrolled at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes Sociales. Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re had an approach to art teaching that matched his need for freedom. He spent three years studying with Ossip Zadkine and French painter Yves Brayer. By 1949 Gentry was teaching visiting Americans at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re and had his first solo Parisian exhibition at Galerie de Seine. Gentry lived the caf√© life in Montparnasse, meeting his fellow American artists at Le D√¥me Caf√©, Le Select caf√© and La Coupole: sculptors Shinkichi Tajiri, Kosta Alex, and Harold Cousins, painters Herbie Katzman, John Hultberg, Burt Hasen, Haywood \\"Bill\\" Rivers, Sam Francis, Avel DeKnight, and painter-filmmaker Carmen D'Avino; as ex-GIs, students and young artists, they casually rubbed shoulders with the greats such as Alberto Giacometti and Georges Braque. There were many others, including Jimmy \\"Loverman\\" Davis, Romare Bearden, Serge Charchoune, George Spaventa, Corneille, Wifredo Lam, and Jean Cocteau. Between 1948 and 1951, Gentry opened Chez Honey, a club-galerie in Montparnasse, an exhibition space by day and a jazz club by night. Featuring his first wife, Tadea Werfelman, known as Honey Johnson, a singer who had come to Europe with Rex Stewart's Band, the club was known as the place to hear modern jazz. Pete Matz accompanied on piano, as would Dick Allen, Art Simmons and Don Byas. The club attracted an international crowd. Patrons included Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Juliette Gr√©co, Eartha Kitt, Orson Welles, Jean-Louis Barrault, and Marcel Marceau. Painter Larry Rivers, who arrived in 1950, jammed with the professional musicians. In November 1951 Gentry left for New York. It proved a difficult adjustment; in 1953 he returned to Paris on the same boat as two painters who would become important friends: Beauford Delaney and Larry Potter. No longer on the GI Bill, Gentry got work in Paris jazz clubs; by 1955 he was arranging entertainment shows for the Allied and American Armed Forces in France and Germany. He met many American musicians and dancers, including Mary Lou Williams, Maya Angelou, and others in Paris such as Art Buchwald and Moune de Rivel(fr). He studied privately with painter Georges Braque. Active in Parisian caf√© life, he and Larry Potter congregated with African-American writers Chester Himes, Ollie Harrington, among others at the Caf√© Tournon; Gentry socialized with visual artists at caf√© Le Select and La Coupole in Montparnasse, where he also met the Dutch, Belgian and Scandinavian artists of the COBRA-group: Ejler Bille, Robert Jacobsen, Karel Appel, Carl-Henning Pedersen, Bram Bogart, and Guillaume Cornelis van Beverloo (aka Corneille). Gentry accepted the opportunity to exhibit at Galerie Hybler in Copenhagen in 1959, and relocated to Copenhagen to prepare. =Copenhagen, 1958‚Äì62= Copenhagen was an important jazz capital in Europe, and hosted a lively African-American community of musicians and artists. After his successful solo exhibition at Galerie Hybler, Gentry remained in Copenhagen to prepare for a series of solo exhibitions in Northern Europe, in Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, and Netherlands. He was soon exhibiting paintings in galleries across Northern Europe. While associating Gentry's paintings with art of the COBRA movement, Danish critics Jen Jorgen Thorsen and Uffe Harder declared his work distinctly American. Over the next five years Gentry had solo exhibitions at Galerie Suzanne Bollag, Zurich, 1959; Galerie Die Insel, Hamburg, 1960; Kunstudstillningsbygning, Odense, DK, 1960; Galerie Aestetica, Stockholm, SE, 1960; Galerie Perron, Geneva, 1961; Galerie Passpartout, Copenhagen, 1961, 1963; Galerie Leger, Malm√∂, 1962; Galerie Rudolph Meier, Davos, 1962. He was invited to exhibit at Den Frie, Copenhagen, in 1960 with the group 6 + 2; in 1964 at Den Frie Gentry was included in \\"10 American Negro Artists\\" with Harvey Cropper, Beauford Delaney, Clifford Jackson, Sam Middleton, Larry Potter, Walter Williams, and others. =Stockholm, 1963‚Äì76= Gentry moved to Gothenburg, Sweden in 1963, and had relocated to Stockholm by 1965. In Sweden he developed friendships with sculptors Torsten Rehnqvist and Willy Gordon, and painters Bengt Lindstr√∂m, and G√∂sta Werner. Important solo exhibitions included Galerie Doktor Glas, Stockholm, 1967; Galerie Marya, Copenhagen, 1967; Galerie Zodiaque, Brussels, 1967 and Vikingsborg Museum, Helsingborg, 1966. While living in Scandinavia, Gentry kept a studio in Paris through 1980. His dedication to mobility differentiated Gentry from most of his fellow American expatriates. He followed the model of artists like Cuban Surrealist Wifredo Lam, who kept studios in more than one country. Montparnasse in Paris remained a central hub for the European art world. In Stockholm in 1975 Gentry was honored with a retrospective exhibition at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts, which traveled to Norrk√∂pings Museum, and Amos Andersson Museum in Helsinki, Finland.Blatt, K., N'Namdi, J., and Rose, M.

Chicago: G. R. N'Namdi Gallery. =Paris, 1976‚Äì80= Gentry was awarded a studio at the Cit√© internationale des arts in Paris and worked there for four years. During this period he experimented, working in acrylic on raw linen. He befriended many artists he met at the Cit√©: Mordecai Ardon, Gerald Jackson, Francisca Lindberg, Christine O'Loughlin, Vicente Pimentel, Mary Anne Rose, Grace Renzi, and Ulla Waller. He had solo exhibitions in the United States and Sweden: Randall Gallery, NYC, 1978; Fabien Carlsson Gallery, Gothenburg, Sweden, 1977; Montclair State College, Montclair, New Jersey, 1977. =Malm√∂, Sweden, 1980‚Äì2003= In later years, he worked less in France and spent more time in New York City. He returned to Sweden and established his studio in Malm√∂ across the √òresund from Copenhagen. He enjoyed its slower pace, milder climate and location near the continent. He reconnected with old friends in Copenhagen. He prepared paintings and prints for gallery exhibitions in Sweden, as well as in Copenhagen, Milan, Amsterdam, and other continental cities. Artist friendships from this period included Uno Svensson and Olle Bonnier. Between 1981 and 1993 he had numerous solo exhibitions in Europe and Scandinavia: Galerie Futura, Stockholm, 1993, 1989; Ragnarpers, G√§rsn√§s, SE, 1993; Falsterbo Konsthall, Falsterbo, SE, 1992; Lilla Galleriet, Helsingborg, SE, 1992, 1985; Gallerihuset, Copenhagen, DK, 1991; B√ºlowska Gallery, Malm√∂, 1991, 1987; Gallery Altes Rathaus, Inzlingen (Basel), DE, 1990; Gooijer Fine Arts, Amsterdam, NE, 1985; Galleria del Naviglio, Milan, Italy, 1984; Biblioteca Comunale di Milano, Milan, 1984; Gallery Asb√¶k, Copenhagen, DK, 1983; Galerie Oscar, Stockholm, 1981. Home in New York, 1969‚Äì2003 In 1971, Moderna Museet Director Pontus Hulten recommended the Chelsea Hotel as an ideal residence for Gentry and his family to take an apartment for a year's stay in New York City. Welcomed by hotel manager Stanley Bard, Gentry discovered a number of artist colleagues from Paris already living and working there. An ideal fit, having a home in New York made it possible for Gentry to return many times and be active in the New York art world. He had exhibitions at Andre Zarre Gallery (New York), 1974 and Selma Burke Art Center, Carnegie Institute (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), 1972. Gentry became a \\"permanent resident\\" of the Chelsea Hotel in 1982. He renewed old artistic friendships: Romare Bearden, Ed Clark, Bill Hutson, and Robert Blackburn, and made new ones. Between 1975 and 1995, Gentry's creative production was fueled by mobility. He was in continuous movement, traveling several times a year. He commuted between New York and Paris (or Sweden), while he established an artistic reputation in the United States. During this period he showed in Europe as an American artist, while in the United States he was exhibited as an African-American artist. Beginning in 1987, Gentry had many one-person exhibitions in the United States: Alitash Kebede Gallery, Los Angeles, California, 2004, 1994, 1987; Quick Art Center, St. Bonaventure University, Olean, New York, 1995; Stella Jones Gallery, New Orleans, Louisiana, 1998; Stella Jones Gallery, New Orleans, Louisiana, 1998; Molloy College, Rockville Centre, New York, 2000; and Macy Gallery, Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, 2000; Steve Turner Gallery, Beverly Hills, California, 2002; Parish Gallery, Georgetown, Washington, D.C., 2003. He had nine solo shows at G. R. N‚ÄôNamdi Gallery between 1991 and 2008: in New York, 2008, 2003; in Chicago, Illinois, 2004, 2000, 1998; in Detroit, Michigan, 2003; and Birmingham, Michigan, 1999, 1996, 1991. Two significant exhibitions‚Äîorganized by and exhibited at the Studio Museum in Harlem‚Äîwere \\"An Ocean Apart\\" in 1982, and \\"Explorations in the City of Light\\" (1996), which traveled to Chicago Cultural Center, Milwaukee Museum of Art, Fort Worth Art Museum and New Orleans Museum of Art. Important retrospective exhibitions since the artist's death in 2003 include: \\"Herbert Gentry: Moved by Music\\", Wadsworth Atheneum, Amistad Center for Art and Culture, Hartford, Connecticut, 2006; \\"Herbert Gentry: the Man the Magic the Master\\", James E. Lewis Museum at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland, 2007; \\"Herbert Gentry: the Man the Magic the Master\\", Diggs Gallery, Winston-Salem State University, North Carolina, 2008; \\"Herbert Gentry: Facing Other Ways\\", Rush Rhees Library Rare Books and Special Collections, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, 2007; \\"Face to Face\\", Phillips Museum of Art, Franklin & Marshall College, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, 2005. Selected collections Gentry's work is in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York); the American Art Museum and Hirshhorn Museum (Smithsonian , Washington, D.C.); the Studio Museum in Harlem (New York); the Masur Museum (Monroe, Louisiana); the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art and the Amistad Center for Art and Culture (Hartford, Connecticut); the Dayton Art Institute (Dayton, Ohio); and the Brooklyn Museum (Brooklyn, New York). In Europe and beyond, his work is collected by the Moderna Museet (Stockholm, Sweden), Norrk√∂pings Art Museum (Norrk√∂ping, Sweden), Stedelijk Museum (Amsterdam, Netherlands), National Gallery of Modern Art (New Delhi, India) and Biblioth√®que Nationale de Paris (France), as well as many private collections.

Thennai kozhukattai is made of the same ingredients as kozhukattai, but is prepared by inserting into young coconut leaves. Unlike regular kozhukattai, the dough is not stuffed with coconut, jaggery or any other stuffing. As preparation, young coconut leaves are cut from a tree (these are identified by the pale green colour, as opposed to the dark green of mature leaves). Their extreme tips and stems are cut off leaving the midsection of each leaf. Then, the rice dough mixture is inserted into the leaves and steamed.

See also: Early life Poppenhusen was born in Hamburg, Germany in 1818. Career Poppenhusen worked for a whalebone purchaser before immigrating to the United States in 1843 to start a whalebone processing plant in Brooklyn New York, New York. In 1852 Poppenhusen received a license from Charles Goodyear to produce hard rubber products and subsequently moved the company to a small rural village in Queens. College Point was founded in 1870 when Poppenhusen incorporated the neighborhoods of Flammersburg and Strattonport together. For his workers in the area, Poppenhusen built housing, the First Reformed Church, and numerous streets. In 1868 Poppenhusen founded the Flushing and North Side Railroad which connected College Point and Flushing, Queens with ferries to Manhattan. (Today the tracks connect to Manhattan directly via tunnels, but no longer to College Point.) In that same year he also founded the Poppenhusen Institute, containing a vocational high school and in 1870, added the free kindergarten. Post-career After Poppenhusen retired in 1871, his three sons lost much of his fortune, and he declared bankruptcy for over $4 million (at least about $84 million ‚Äî or perhaps as much as $9 billion ‚Äî in 2015 dollars). Family and personal life Poppenhusen married Bertha Marie Henrietta Karker in May 1841. They had four children: sons Adolph (?‚Äì?), Heinrich Conrad (1846‚Äì?) and Herman Christian (1847‚Äì?), and daughter Marie (1849‚Äì?). Conrad Poppenhusen died in College Point in 1883 and was memorialized by the community with a statue in Poppenhusen Park in 1884. His remains were stored temporarily in nearby Flushing Cemetery and were then shipped months later to his native Germany where they were buried in Ohlsdorf Cemetery in Hamburg.

The central tenet of internarrative identity is that the ability of individuals to shape their lives is extended by multiple autobiographical narratives with associative principles beyond temporality. This concept was developed in 1997 by Ajit K. Maan in the central text Internarrative Identity. Overview While the foundation of Narrative Identity Theory is the holding together of life experiences in a unified structure, Internarrative Identity Theory celebrates what have previously been considered problematic areas of experience - conflict, marginalization, disruption, subversion, deviation - as places of possibility for self creation. Internarrative Identity Theory locates the solution of narrative conflict within the problem itself. Existence in-between authoritarian discourses and dominant cultures enables an extended form of agency wherein a subject is able to undermine traditional associations, assumptions, concepts, and at the same time, create links between otherwise incommensurable world views. Rather than being a passive recipient of dominant discourses the Internarrative subject is uniquely able to subvert regulatory identity practices.

She is Britain's earliest example of a Voith Schneider driven ferry. Renamed MV Sound of Sanda in 1974, she served Western Ferries on the Upper Clyde until 1993. History MV Lymington was built in 1938 as an Isle of Wight ferry. She was the first British vessel driven by Voith Schneider propulsion units. Throughout the war, she was on the Lymington-Yarmouth service on the Solent. A slab of concrete placed above her wheelhouse offered some protection against airborne attack. By 1972, Lymington was too small for her owners' needs. Arrival of new ferries led to her being withdrawn and placed on the sale list. She was bought by Western Ferries for their new crossing from Hunter's Quay to McInroy's Point. Returning to the Clyde, she was modified to suit her new owner's needs and renamed Sound of Sanda. She served Western Ferries faithfully from late August 1974 until 1989, latterly being relegated to carrying cement tankers to Faslane while the new Trident submarine base was under construction. She had served Western Ferries well - but no longer had a viable role in the fleet due to her age and small capacity. Britain's earliest example of a VSP driven ferry, Sound of Sanda failed to attract a suitable home for preservation. Efforts by a group of southern enthusiasts, the 'Lymington Preservation Society' failed to find money and somewhere for the vessel. Western Ferries were very aware of the vessel's significance and offered her to the Scottish Maritime Museum at Irvine. Again, there was neither money nor a secure berth and they were forced to place her on the open market. Sound of Sanda lay for a number of years in Holy Loch, on a mooring belonging to Western Ferries and was eventually sold to Donald Harper of Oban, for use as a fish farm support vessel. She left the Clyde in March 1994 and was deliberately beached at Taynuilt on the shore of Loch Etive, to allow work to be carried out. After some time, with much of her structure cut away, Argyll and Bute Council decided that the vessel had been abandoned, and stripped out her machinery. Her main engines were taken to Greenock by lorry, travelling aboard Sound of Sleat. Over a couple of months, she was reduced to a hulk, which was re-floated and left to rot at a mooring in the loch. Western Ferries also named a later vessel MV Sound of Sanda. Layout The single car deck had ramps at each end. The novel Voith Schneider propellors proved very successful, allowing the ship to turn in her own length.

The team competes in series such as the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters and FIA GT1 World Championship. History Oliver Jarvis racing for Audi Sport Team Phoenix in 2009 Phoenix Racing competed in the German Supertouring Championship in 1999 with Michael Bartels and Arnd Meier driving Audi A4s. The team moved to the revived Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters series in 2000, running Opel Astra V8 Coupes, with Manuel Reuter finishing as runner-up and Bartels finishing seventh. The team also won the 24 Hours of N√ºrburgring in a Porsche GT3-R with Bartels, Uwe Alzen, Altfrid Heger and Bernd Mayl√§nder as drivers. Phoenix repeated this victory in 2003 in an Opel Astra with Reuter, Timo Scheider, Volker Strycek and Marcel Tiemann. Opel began to struggle in the DTM in 2001, with Reuter the best Opel in ninth position and Phoenix teammate Yves Oliver finishing down in 22nd place. Phoenix and Opel never won another DTM race up until the end of 2005, when the manufacturer withdrew. For 2006, there was a need for more cars to be run by the remaining two manufacturers, Mercedes-Benz and Audi. This led to Phoenix running one-year-old Audi A4s from the 2006 season onwards. In 2011 Martin Tomczyk won the DTM drivers title for Phoenix at the penultimate race in Valencia, with 3 victories, 7 total podiums, and 1 pole position. In 2013, Mike Rockenfeller took the title in the 2013 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters season with one race remaining having 2 wins and 3 second places, driving the Audi A5. Phoenix Racing also began competing in the FIA GT Championship in 2006, with Jean-Denis D√©l√©traz and Andrea Piccini finishing the season as runners-up in an Aston Martin DBR9. For 2007 the team joined up with Toine Hezemans' Carsport Holland team to form Phoenix Carsport. Deletraz and Mike Hezemans finished in third place in the standings racing a Corvette C6.R. In 2008, Hezemans and Fabrizio Gollin finished as runners-up for the team. In 2009, Carsport returned to running their team with Peka Racing, but Phoenix and Carsport will again partner each other in 2010 for the first season of the FIA GT1 World Championship. Phoenix Racing became an Audi Sport factory-supported team in 2009, competing at the Blancpain Endurance Series and 24 Hours of N√ºrburgring with an Audi R8 GT3 LMS. In 2012, the team won the Bathurst 12 Hour, the 24 Hours of N√ºrburgring and the 24 Hours of Spa. They also won the 2014 24 Hours of N√ºrburgring and the 2016 Sepang 12 Hours.

It was built near the village of Uxegney between 1883 and 1885. It is an example of a S√©r√© de Rivi√®res system fortification. It escaped significant alteration in the years prior to World War I and is maintained as a museum. Description The Fort de Bois l'Abb√© stands to the east of its larger neighbor, the Fort d'Uxegney, at an altitude of . Its stone construction provides an excellent example of an un-modified S√©r√© de Rivi√®res position. The four-sided fort is somewhat smaller than the Fort d'Uxegney, with caponiers defending the protective ditch in lieu of the more modern counterscarps of Uxegney. It was constructed in 1884-1885 to watch the road from Dom√®vre-sur-Axiƒóre. A program of reinforcement was proposed in 1911, but never pursued. Original armament comprised four 120mm guns and two 90mm guns, with additional smaller arms. It was upgraded with 75mm anti-aircraft guns in 1915, while the larger guns had been removed. The fort lost strategic importance as it became clear that its views were obstructed by the Bois de Souche. A number of smaller positions were built in the Bois de Souche in lieu of improving the main fort. These were not completed at the time of mobilization in 1914. Between 1900 and 1906 infantry shelters of a spiral queue de cochon or \\"pig's tail design were installed around the fort. In 1913-14 the fort received electricity, fed from the local power grid. The fort served as a central bakery, providing bread to the Fort d'Uxegney and the Fort de la Grande Haye. History Interior of caponier at Fort de Bois l'Abb√© The Fort de Bois de l'Abb√© saw no action during World War I, as the Germans did not advance into the area around √âpinal. Concrete platforms were placed on the surface of the fort for 75mm anti-aircraft guns following the aerial bombardment of √âpinal, but the guns were never installed. Between World War I and World War II the fort remained military property and was used as an ammunition depot. During World War II the Germans used Bois l'Abb√© to house occupying forces and continued to use it for ammunition storage. The French army maintained an ammunition depot at the Fort de Bois l'Abb√© until 1960. It was used after 1960 by private tenants, but was restored by the ' (ARFUPE) beginning in 1995. The fort may be visited on special occasions.

Paramount Pictures, Inc. decision, in which he found historical and economic reasons for the practices that were challenged by the Department of Justice, and in which most of his key ideas were expressed far before he confirmed them statistically. In 1996, along with W. David Walls, he published the Bose-Einstein paperDe Vany, Arthur S. and W. David Walls. \\"Bose‚ÄìEinstein dynamics and adaptive contracting in the motion picture industry\\". Economic Journal, 439 (106): 1493‚Äì1514, 1996 in the Economic Journal. Using the Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics concept used for quantum physics, he showed the complex convergence toward the Pareto distribution during the theatrical run and the way word-of-mouth drove a theatrical run's almost chaotic behavior. He was able to show that the film industry was able to adjust to such phenomena using adaptive, exhibition contracts and decentralizing decisions to be allocated to the local exhibitor through the hold-over and rental terms of the contract. In an article co-authored with W. David Walls and published in Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, he also coined the phrase \\"superstar's curse\\" to describe the dilemma film producers face in hiring movie stars. Producers calculate the expected increase that a star will provide to a film's profit, then pay that star the difference. However, the returns of film are heavily skewed, such that the expected return (in statistical terms, the mean) is higher than the most common return (the mode). 80% of the time, the film will return less than the expected return. Thus, 80% of the time, the film will lose money. Evolutionary fitness De Vany has worked on the concept of evolutionary fitness (similar to the Paleolithic lifestyle). He outlines his approach in The New Evolution Diet: What Our Paleolithic Ancestors Can Teach Us about Weight Loss, Fitness, and Aging (December 2010). His ideas about fitness include a diet and fitness regime that promotes a more random behavior that mimics the natural way ancestral people lived in place of the steady and regular eating and exercise that are the norm in Western societies. He follows a diet that mimics the diet of ancient humans during the Paleolithic period with carefully selected modern foods such as vegetables, lean meat and seafood, fresh fruits and nuts. He also advocates glucose restriction and intermittent fasting as methods to turn down the aging pathways.

She is a contributing editor at Orion. Strand is also a former fellow in the Behrman Center for the Humanities at Princeton University. Strand is often considered an environmental writer, a label she has said she never sought.https://ces.williams.edu/log/ginger-strand-on-being-an-environmental- writer/ She has been critical of Google‚Äôs environmental policies. Her 2008 article \\"The Crying Indian\\" in Orion, which won a Pushcart Prize, drew links between Native American displacement, government-funded aluminum production, and Keep America Beautiful, which she labels an astroturfing organization. In a November 2006 New York Times story, she talks about her personal difficulty in being eco-conscious. She lists her obsessions as water, ancient Rome, infrastructure, SuperFund, airplanes, silent film, panopticons, P. T. Barnum, photography, lies, the 1930s, Niagara Falls, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Edward Wormley, consumerism and rhinoceroses, especially one named Clara who lived in the 18th century.

Strand's second book was nonfiction, Inventing Niagara: Beauty, Power, Lies, and published by Simon & Schuster in early 2008. The book combines history, reportage, and personal narrative to build a cultural history of natural wonder at Niagara Falls. Strand writes about how Niagara Falls has been depicted and used throughout America's history, and how its natural environment has been altered. In researching her second book, Strand used handbills, guidebooks, travelogues, treaties, and images in the American Antiquarian Society's collections. The book chronicles Strands' fascination with infrastructure, which she calls \\"a culture's dream made visible.‚Äù Inventing Niagara received positive reviews in the New York Times Book Review, Newsweek, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal.

Origins Cranstoun was the son of John Cranstoun of Morriestoun and grandson of Cuthbert Cranstoun of Thirlestanemains, belonging to one branch of a prominent Lowland family, whose estates had since at least the 14th century ( been centred on Cranston (or \\"Cranstoun\\"), in Midlothian, and Denholm, in the Borders.Sir John Balfour Paul, The Scots Peerage, volume II (David Douglas, Edinburgh, 1905), at pages 592-593 The last Cranstoun of Cranstoun - Sir John, who was still alive in June 1609 - left five daughters, of whom William married the second, Sarah. Their contract of marriage was dated December 1580. Career King James appointed Cranstoun to the position of Captain of the Horse Garrison, or King's Guard, under the Earl of Dunbar, Lieutenant of the Borders. In 1605 he was keeper of Lochmaben Castle and a deputy-lieutenant of the Borders. Cranstoun rapidly acquired a reputation for extreme ruthlessness. On one occasion, the inhabitants of Dumfries conspired unsuccessfully to assassinate him and he more than once received blanket pardons or indemnities, holding him harmless in respect of prior atrocities.Mark Netzloff, England's Internal Colonies (Palgrave Macmillan, 2003), at page 144 The summary approach adopted by Lord Dunbar and Cranstoun (hang first and try afterwards) became known as \\"Jeddart Justice\\".Peter Hume Brown, History of Scotland, volume VI In 1608, Cranstoun represented the small barons of Roxburghshire in the Convention of Estates.Joseph Foster, Members of Parliament, Scotland, including the minor barons (Hazell, Watson and Viney, 1882), at page 81 He was raised to the peerage, as Lord Cranstoun, by patent dated 19 November 1609. In 1611 he was promoted to succeed Lord Dunbar as Lieutenant of the Borders and was appointed to the Privy Council. Sir John Balfour Paul's The Scots Peerage records of him that: :\\"He was a man of singular energy and fearlessness, and though his relentless rule on the Borders of necessity made him many enemies, yet his persistence therein brought back that region to a state of law and order such as it had not known for many years, and from which it never really again lapsed.\\" Cranstoun died in June 1627.

Cannadine argues that class, rank and status were more important to the British Empire than race. The title of the work Ornamentalism is a direct reference to Edward Said's book Orientalism, which argues the existence of prejudiced outsider interpretations of the East (\\"the Other\\"), shaped by the attitudes of European imperialism in the 18th and 19th centuries. It has also been argued to borrow tones from the title of Joseph Schumpeter's \\"Imperialism and Social Classes\\", which some historians see as the origins of the 'Ornamentalist' perspective in academic history'. Analysis Ornamentalism presents a new view of the British Empire through an economic, social, and political lens. It argues that the British were motivated not only by race, but also by class to expand the empire. Cannadine traces the origins of this view to the local governments of sixteenth-century Tory England where those with high social prestige dominated. He argues that, by extension, \\"many British settlers overseas sought to create a full-scale replica of the elaborately graded social hierarchy they had left behind at home\\" (14). Additional evidence comes from the deference to Queen Victoria in both white and non-white colonies: \\"the British Empire was a royal empire, presided over and unified by a sovereign of global amplitude and semi-divine fullness, and suffused with the symbols and signifiers of kingship, which reinforced, legitimated, unified and completed the empire as a realm bound together by order, hierarchy, tradition and subordination\\" (102). Another key theme was a culture of ornamentalism that developed following Benjamin Disraeli's Imperial Titles Act of 1876 that declared Queen Victoria Empress of India. National distinctions of class and inequality in Britain directly diffused throughout the empire. P. J. Marshall states that Cannadine makes two arguments in Ornamentalism: *\\"...the history of the British empire and the history of Britain itself are inseparable and must be studied as a seamless whole\\" *\\"the high days of British imperialism, that is from about 1850 to about 1950, the history of the empire and that of Britain were brought together by a British commitment to reproduce overseas the kind of hierarchical society that, Cannadine believes, existed in Britain\\" Criticism Ornamentalism has attracted considerable attention from both academics and the public. Stanley Hoffmann, the Paul and Catherine Buttenwieser University Professor at Harvard University described the book as \\"delightful and instructive\\", revealing a \\"far more complex reality\\" of the British Empire. Richard Gott, a journalist and historian, argued that \\"his book is not just a restatement of traditional conservative history, it is a romantic and postmodernist version suitable for the New Labour era.\\" The book has also been criticized for underplaying the racial elements of the British imperial project. This view was echoed by Fouad Ajami, a former professor of Middle Eastern history and politics at Princeton University and Johns Hopkins University. Gyan Prakash, a historian and professor at Princeton University, argued that \\"The empire itself was based on a racial divide -- you cannot get away from that.\\" See also *Imperialism *Edward Said and Orientalism *Historiography of the British Empire ReferencesExternal links *Prejudice behind the pomp and baubles, Times Higher Category:2001 non-fiction books Category:21st-century history books Category:History books about the British Empire Category:Books by David Cannadine Category:Postcolonial literature Category:British Empire ","title":"Ornamentalism"},{"id":"26929952","text":"Jens Bodewalt Lampe (November 8, 1869 ‚Äì May 26, 1929) was a Danish-born American composer, arranger, performer and band-leader of ragtime and syncopated dance music. Lampe was born in Ribe, Denmark to Christian and Sophia Lampe. In 1873, his family moved to St. Paul, Minnesota, where his father took over leadership of the Great Western Band. Lampe was a child prodigy on the violin and became the first chair violinist for the Minneapolis Symphony at age 16.

In the early 1890s, he and his wife moved to Buffalo, where they had four children, Walter, Petra, Dorothy and Joseph Dell (known later as \\"Dell\\"). At this time, he began composing and publishing his own music and led a dance orchestra. In 1900, a year after the success of Joplin's \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\", he published his most successful and enduring song \\"Creole Belles\\", a rag or cakewalk that sold more than a million copies in sheet music.

Built in 1928 for an Orthodox congregation founded in 1912, it is a distinctive example of a neighborhood synagogue with elaborate Classical Revival styling, for which it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. The building is now home to Thomas Chapel, which is affiliated with the Church of Christ. (pages 86-92 omitting page 89) and Description and history The former Ahavas Sholem Synagogue stands on the west side of White Street, a short residential street in New Haven's The Hill neighborhood, southwest of downtown. It is a two-story masonry structure, built out of gold-colored brick with limestone trim. It has a particularly handsome Classical Revival facade, with limestone on the first level, which is continued on the second level around that floor's arched windows. A panel above the main entrance identifies the congregation and the year of the building's construction in the Hebrew calendar. Some of its original windows are incised with the Star of David, which is repeated in a rounded pediment at the roof level. An Orthodox congregation was organized in this neighborhood in 1912. According to Orthodox practice, it was necessary to walk to Sabbath services, resulting in the founding of relatively small congregations such as this one. The building was erected in 1928, and was used by the congregation until most of its members moved away in the 1960s. The building is now occupied by a Christian congregation, the Thomas Hill Chapel Church of Christ. Ahavas Sholem Synagogue, detail of fa√ßade.

Origins Kiltane derives its name from Cill tS√©adhna, or Seadhna's church, which was in the townland of Kiltane by the banks of the Owenmore River. The name 'Seadhna' was well known in the Early Christian Period. There is mention of a bishop and priest of that name in an old tract but no detail as to where they worked.MacHale, The Parishes III p.64 The name was common in the family from which Darbiled (Dervilla) and Fighernan came, both of whom preached in Erris. A huge part of this parish is blanket bog which was acquired by Bord na Mona. From it they transported milled peat to the now defunct, peat-fuelled power station at Bellacorick, now the site of a large wind farm. History For administrative purposes as well as limiting the number of Catholic clergy during the Penal times (17th century), Erris was divided into two parishes, namely, Kilcommon and Kilmore. (This territorial arrangement is still adhered to for civil and statutory purposes). Only one priest was permitted to serve each parish. In 1704, Fr. Michael Monnely, serving Kilcommon, lived at Cloontikilla. In 1731, there were two priests, no Mass house, many wandering friars and hedge schools abounded. In a Government document of 1801 compiled from data supplied by the local Catholic bishops, Kilcommon is given as still having only two priests. Their combined income was ¬£90. The same list notes that Ballycroy also had two priests with a combined annual income of ¬£80. About 1825, after the building of Belmullet town had begun, Kilcommon was divided into two parishes; Kilcommon West (the present parish of Belmullet including Geesala and Doohoma) and Kilcommon East (namely, the present Kilcommon parish plus Bangor and Ballymonnelly areas). The boundaries were again altered in August 1873 when the present parish of Kiltane, Erris, was formed and the ancient name was restored. Townlands Kiltane contains the following townlands:- * Altnabrocky * Attawalla * Ballina-Erris * Ballybeg * Bangor Erris * Bellacorick * Bellanumera * Briska * Cloontakilla * Croaghaun * Darraragh * Doohoma * Doolough * Dooyork * Drumanaffrin * Gweesalia * Glencullen Upper and Lower * Glenturk Beg and More * Goolamore * Kilsallagh * Kiltane * Largan Beg and More * Lenanadurtaun * Muingaghel * Muingnahalloona * Muinghanarnad * Rosnagleragh * Roy * Sheean * Sheskin * Srahanarry * Srahgraddy * Srahmore - notorious claim to fame: the bog from Bellanaboy was dumped here by Royal Dutch Shell in 2007. * Srahnakilla * Tarsaghaun More * Tavnagh * Tavnanasool * Tristia (Mount Jubilee) * Tullaghanbaun * Tullaghanduff * Tullaghaunnashammer * Uggool References Category:Civil parishes of County Mayo Category:Erris ","title":"Kiltane"},{"id":"26929981","text":"Lobby card Lobby card Counterfeit is a 1919 American silent detective drama filmAmerican Film Institute Catalogue, Feature Films 1911-1920The AFI Catalog of Feature Films:Counterfeit(Wayback)Progressive Silent Film List: Counterfeit at silentera.com directed by George Fitzmaurice and starring Elsie Ferguson.

This option is available on chess websites such as the Internet Chess Club and the Free Internet Chess Server. Description To use premove, a player makes a move in the same way they would move if it was their turn. After their opponent moves, the original player's move is immediately made, assuming that the move is still legal. Premove is not available in over-the-board chess. Premoving is only recommended if a player is very low on time, as it entails the risk that the opponent will do something unexpected that leads to the premove no longer being an appropriate play. However, it can save a player a split second, making it useful for fast chess. It is also useful to save time when the opponent's reply is forced, meaning there is no possibility of a premove backfiring due to an unexpected move.

Overview A shunt is described as a tube, catheter or \\"surgically created anastomosis\\"McGraw‚ÄìHill Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine. 2002. The McGraw‚ÄìHill Companies, Inc. http://medical- dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/shunt (Accessed April 2010) and is designed to bypass or redirect bodily fluids from one point in the body to another. Lumbar‚Äìperitoneal shunts are used in neurological disorders, in cases of chronic increased intracranial pressure to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the Subarachnoid cavity associated with such conditions as hydrocephalus and Benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) also known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and pseudotumor cerebri (PTC), idiopathic intracranial hypertension is the preferred name for the condition. There are various categories of medical shunts and there are two main categories of shunt used in the treatment of chronic increased intracranial pressure due to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), they are cerebral shunts and lumbar shunts (extracranial shunts). Below is a list of the various types of the above two categories of shunts: Cerebral shunts * Ventriculo‚Äìperitoneal shunt (VP shunt) * Ventriculo‚Äìatrial shunt (VA shunt) * Ventriculo‚Äìpleural shunt (VPL shunt) Lumbar shunts * Lumbar‚Äìperitoneal shunt (LP shunt) * Lumbar subcutaneous shunt (LS shunt) Composition of shunts Each of the types of shunts listed above can be composed of a tube or catheter and various types of valves, although they can just be composed of the tubing or catheter. Below is a list of valves that are used in lumbar‚Äìperitoneal shunts (LP shunts) and Cerebral shunts (for a more detailed list of the types of valves see type of valves): * Delta * Medium Pressure Cylindrical * Nulsen and Spitz * Anti-Siphon * Sigma The composition of a lumbar‚Äìperitoneal shunt is dependent on the Neurosurgeon performing the operation, there are no guidelines determining what the composition of the lumbar‚Äìperitoneal shunt should be for different types of cases. The composition of the lumbar‚Äìperitoneal shunt can affect how well the patient will get on with the shunt and whether or not they may need revisions in the future, although this is not the only determining factor in whether or not a revision will be necessary. Placement The lumbar‚Äìperitoneal shunt is inserted between two of the vertebrae in the lumbar region of the spine into the Subarachnoid cavity, also known as the Subarachnoid space. The Subarachnoid cavity is a spongy tissue-filled cavity that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, and this is where cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is contained. The shunt is placed under the skin and continues around the oblique muscles on one side of the body, and terminates at the peritoneal cavity, a cavity in the abdomen area of the body. Once in place the lumbar‚Äìperitoneal shunt is used to drain the excess cerebrospinal fluid from the brain via the Subarachnoid cavity and transport it to the peritoneal cavity, where it is eventually absorbed by the organs and passed out of the body during urination. The operation is performed under General anesthetic by a neurosurgeon and usually takes a couple of hours. Patients with lumbar‚Äìperitoneal shunts are left with two scars; a vertical scar down part of the lumbar of the spine, and a horizontal scar across the upper abdomen. A lumbar‚Äìperitoneal shunt is expected to remain in situ for the lifespan of the patient unless revisions or relocation of the shunt is required. In some cases the shunt has been removed completely, however this is very rare as it is difficult to determine when a patients condition has changed to enable them to be independent of the shunt and relapse of the condition can occur requiring the patient to undergo surgery for the placement of a shunt again. A Lumbar subcutaneous shunt (LS shunt) differs from these types of shunt in that the cerebrospinal fluid drains into the potential space immediately under the skin. A narrow tube is inserted into the subarachnoid space in the lumbar part of the back during a lumbar puncture. It is then fed under the skin to a site where it can drain fluid, usually in the flank. Shunt revisions The revision of a shunt means to replace or make adjustments to all or part of the shunt, this also means that the location of the shunt may be changed therefore changing the category or type of shunt a patient has. For some patients with shunts, a revision or multiple revisions to the shunt may be required. This can be something minor, such as adjusting the setting on a valve to change the flow level through the valve to replacing a substantial length of the shunt, or even replacing the entire shunt or relocating the shunt route to a different part of the body. For example, it may be required for a patient with a lumbar‚Äìperitoneal shunt, if multiple revisions are required or overdrainage is occurring, to have it replaced with a ventriculo‚Äìperitoneal shunt (VP shunt). Shunt revisions are required due to the following complications: * Over drainage * Under drainage * Infection * Blockage or obstruction References * * * * *IIH UK (July 2008) https://web.archive.org/web/20100225051330/http://www.iih.org.uk/iih.php * Category:Neurology procedures ","title":"Lumbar‚Äìperitoneal shunt"},{"id":"26930251","text":"≈åtorohanga District is a territorial municipality in the King Country area and Waikato region of the North Island of New Zealand.

Career Dragu was born in Regina, Saskatchewan, in 1953. Growing up she was influenced by traditional Romanian folk dancing. As an adult she spent time in New York, Calgary, Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver. She began her dance career in Calgary in 1969, studying under Yone Kvietys Young, who was an instructor of movement using elements of Dada. From Calgary, Dragu moved to New York in 1971, where she began working with Alwin Nikolais, Murray Louis, and the Laura Foreman dance company, as well as members of the Judson Church. Her work with movement evolved to include elements of \\"burlesque, tap dancing, flamenco, and theatre.\\" In 1973 Dragu moved to Montreal where she began a lengthy career as a striptease artist. In 1975 Dragu moved to Toronto and became affiliated with artist-run collectives including A Space and 15 Dance Lab. She taught classes in aerobics and strip at the A Space gallery. In Toronto Dragu attempted to organize around strippers' rights with the help of the Canadian Labour Congress and the Association of Canadian Radio and Television Artists. The short lived strippers' union was called the Canadian Association for Burlesque Entertainers. In 1988 Dragu co-wrote Revelations: Essays on Striptease and Sexuality with A. S. A. Harrison, a collection of essays on the topics of striptease and sexual entertainment. Dragu has stated that she has a \\"multi- personnae\\" disorder, becoming Lady Justice, Verb Woman, Art Cinderella, and Nuestra Se√±ora del Pan. For a performance at Edmonton's Vision of Hope monument, with a sword, salt, wine and scales that viewers associate with Lady Justice, she honored the women killed in the massacre at Montreal's √âcole Polytechnique. She has collaborated with artists such as Tom Dean, members of General Idea, Rodney Werden and Kate Craig, and members of the communities in which she performs. In 2012, Dragu won the Governor General's Award in Visual and Media Arts. Dragu resides in East Vancouver. She created a radio show, Momz Radio which focused on interviewing mothers about their experiences with motherhood. Through this research, she wrote a book by the same name, Momz Radio: Mothers Talkback. Dragu has created video art for YouTube, and writes two blogs, which she updates as Lady Justice and Verb Woman respectively. Choreographic works Dragu's work is known for being interdisciplinary and site specific. She collaborates with other artists and sometimes, the public. Her work is often based strongly in activism, whether feminist, environmental, social or otherwise. *Slits (performance art group show; title of Dragu's performance: \\"Der Blaue Engel\\"; curator: Victoria Singh) Western Front, Vancouver, BC, January 25, 2003 *Pie Performances Richmond Art Gallery, Richmond, BC, January 2003 grunt gallery, Vancouver, BC, January 2003 Hamilton Art Gallery, Hamilton, BC, November 2002 *Casting (group improvisation with Reciprocity/cite) 7a*11d Performance Art Festival, Toronto, Ontario, November 2002 *The Wall is In My Head/le mur est dans ma tete/ Ich Habe Die Mauer in Meinem Kopf/lu muro e dentra mi testa'' (with ReciproCity/cite) Elle Corazon, Montreal, Quebec, October 2001 Gladstone Hotel, Toronto, Ontario, November 2001 *Living Art Cosmo Mall, Richmond, BC, November 2000 Cleaning and Loving (It) Queen's Park/V Tape, FADO, Toronto, Ontario, July 2000 *Conscious Corpus: Corp Domestique & Corpus Delicious Western Front, Vancouver, BC, May 7‚Äì10, 2000 *Improvisation for X‚Äôs and O‚Äôs (with 25 lb. of potatoes) Grunt Gallery/Vogue Theatre, Vancouver, BC, Oct.1999 (with guitarist Brian Krocher) Niagara Artists‚Äô Centre, St. Catharines, Ont., June 1999 (with violinist Jim Munro) Grunt Gallery, Vancouver, BC, February 1999 *Eine Kleine Nacht Radio/a little night radio Niagara Artists‚Äô Centre, St. Catharines, Ontario, June 1999 Artword Theatre, Toronto, Ontario, June 1999 grunt Gallery, Vancouver, BC, February 1999 (German Tour by Canadian Dept. of Foreign Affairs & International Trade with Hessiche Ministerium fur Wissenschaft und Kunst of Germany & Cultural Dept. of Netherlands) Moltkerei Werkstadt, Koln, Germany darK.-Halle, Mainz, Germany c.u.b.a., Munster, Germany Carl Stipendium, Essen, Germany Artis, s‚ÄôHertogenbosch, Netherlands, June 1998 *X‚Äôs & O‚Äôs for the Rites/Right of May Richmond Cultural Centre, Richmond, BC, May Day, 1999 *Otzenrath Stipendium Otzenrath, Bonn, Germany, June 1998 *A Deconstructed Dollhouse/une maison de poupees en deconstruction The @ Gallery, Vancouver, BC, April 1997 Theatre, Toronto, Ontario Niagara Artists' Collective, St. Catharines, Ontario Le Lieu's rencontre intern. d'art performance et multimedia, Quebec City, PQ, Oct.1996 *Secret Kitchen Richmond Public Library/Cultural Building, Richmond, BC; March 1998 Silverton Art Gallery, Silverton, BC, July 1995 Women in View Festival, Station Arts Theatre, Vancouver, BC, January 1995 New Performance Festival, Hornby Island, BC, May 1992 Festival, grunt gallery, Vancouver, BC, September 1991 Artspace, Peterborough, Ontario, August 1990 *The Bardo Gap Western Front, Vancouver, BC, September 1994 Nine Suits with Paul Gibbons and Jim Munro Silverton Art Gallery, Silverton, BC, July 1995 with Jim Munro, Bill Smith, Dana Inglis and David Lee Mayworks Arts Festival, Hornby Island, BC, May 1994 *Sliced Bread -with Jim Munro, Roy Kiyooka, Bill Smith and Dana Inglis Mayworks Arts Festival, Hornby Island, BC, May 1993 EDAM Dance Studio, Western Front, Vancouver, BC, February 1993 *Square Foot Real/realite au metre carre - with Jim Munro Niagara Artists' Centre, St. Catharines, Ontario Music Gallery, Toronto, Ontario, with guest artist David Prentice Artspace, Peterborough, Ontario Oboro, Montreal, Quebec; October 1992 *Pheromones - with Billy Little, Bill Smith, Jim Munro & Joey Meyer Artropolis, Vancouver, BC, November 1990 *Original X's & O's Series X's & O's for the Canadian Pavilion Expo '86, Vancouver, BC, August 1986 X's & O's for Friday the Thirteenth Western Front, Vancouver, BC, November 1985 X's & O's in the Dead of Winter Off Centre Centre, Calgary, Alberta, January 1984 X's & O's on the Shortest Day of the Year Art Gallery of Hamilton, Hamilton, Ontario, Dec. 21/83 X's & O's on the Longest Day of the Year Art Gallery of Hamilton's Artworks in the Garden, Royal Botanical Garden of Burlington, Ontario, June 21/83 JOY OF MULTIDICIPLINE Artspace, Peterborough, Ontario, March 1986 Emily Carr School of Art, Vancouver, BC, November 1985 Artcite Gallery, Windsor, Ontario, December 1984 Niagara Artists' Centre, St. Catharines, Ontario, May 1984 Banff School of Fine Arts, Banff, Alberta, January 1984 Alberta School of Art, Calgary, Alberta, January 1984 Articule, Montreal, Quebec, November 1983 *My Wireless is Running- with Colin Campbell Toronto Dance Theatre, Toronto, Ontario, May‚ÄìJune 1984 *I‚Äôm Already Chaning my Mind ‚Äì with Colin Campbell Harbourfront Studio Theatre, Toronto, Ontario, June 1982 Fear of Blue/angst vor blau - with Tom Dean Akademie der Kunste, Berlin, Germany, January 1983 London Art Gallery, London, Ontario, November 1982 Artspace, Peterborough, Ontario, October 1982 *Her Majesty/sa majeste - with Tom Dean Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, Ontario, March 1981 Palais des Beaux Arts, Brussels, Belgium, February 1981 *D.W.I.

Czechoslovakia was a country in Central Europe which existed from October 1918, when it declared its independence from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, until 1992. From 1939 to 1945 the state did not have de facto existence, due to its forced division and partial incorporation into Nazi Germany, but the Czechoslovak government-in-exile nevertheless continued to exist during this time period. On 1 January 1993 Czechoslovakia peacefully split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

The Hradƒçany Castle stamps illustrate the castle in Prague with the sun symbolically rising behind it is synonymous with the birth of the new state though the sun does not actually rise behind the castle. The stamps, designed by graphic designer Alphonse Mucha, an exponent of Art Nouveau living in Prague, was chosen from the more than ten submitted designs. Mucha's reason for choosing the castle motif was because: 1920 50-heller Chainbreaker stamp The issue comes in two distinct sets with fifty-three different stamps that can be classified by five different types. The words Po≈°ta ƒåesko-Slovensk√° are arranged around the two sides and top of the first set while on the second set ƒåesko-Slovensk√° is in one line under the main castle design. The different types show slight variations in the design but several errors exist that include plate faults and flaws as well as different printing plates. Fewer variations exist in succeeding issues because the Ministry of Posts' designers, engravers and print mills improved their skills with experience. The first of several stamps illustrate Thomas Masaryk, the country's first president, followed in 1920 with three denominations of 125h, 500h and 1000h designed by Max ≈†vabinsk√Ω. That year also saw two allegorical sets issued showing a stylised carrier pigeon in six values and referred to by some as Dove stamps, and the ten denominations of The Chainbreaker, symbolising the country, shows a woman breaking free from the chain of bondage. Both these sets also exist in tete- beche pairs due to a booklet printing plate layout proposed by a private company who were going to use the gutter for advertising as well as pay the printing costs, however, even though the stamps had been printed, the booklet deal never happened. 2-heller newspaper stamp Newspaper stamps At the same time as the Hradƒçany Castle stamps were issued in 1918, two newspaper stamps in 2h and 10h denominations, also designed by Alphonse Mucha were released. More values were added over time; 6h, 20h and 30h in 1919 and 5h, 50h and 100h in 1920. A few design variations and varieties exist. The 5h value, first released in September 1920 holds the record for the largest number of stamps printed being 3.6 billion. These stamps were also overprinted for use in East Silesia in 1920 and for a discounted commercial printed matter rate in 1934 and a 2h was overprinted 5h to supplement the supply of that denomination. Overprinted Czechoslovak stamp for use in East Silesia East Silesia In 1920, Czechoslovak stamps overprinted S O 1920 and Polish stamps overprinted S.O. 1920 were issued for use in Cieszyn Silesia, an area disputed between Czechoslovakia and Poland. Military post In 1919 and 1920 the Czechoslovak Army in Siberia issued stamps for military posts and use on the Siberian Railway. A 1939 stamp of Bohemia and Moravia World War II A German Protectorate was established over Bohemia and Moravia, the Czech areas of Czechoslovakia, between 1939 and 1945 following the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. Over 100 stamps were issued including definitive and commemorative issues, charity stamps, newspaper stamps and official stamps. Post war After World War II, Czechoslovakia was re-established and regular issues of Czechoslovakia resumed.  Last stamps  A 1968 stamp marking the 50th anniversary of the first postage stamps of Czechoslovakia The last stamp of Czechoslovakia was issued on 18 December 1992 and marked Stamp Day.

Kirsch (June 20, 1929August 11, 2020) was an American engineer at the National Bureau of Standards (now known as the National Institute of Standards and Technology). He was recognized as the developer of the first digital image scanner. Background scanned image of Russell Kirsch's son Walden, 1957 Education Kirsch was born in Manhattan on June 20, 1929. His parents were Jewish emigrants from Russia and Hungary. He attended the Bronx High School of Science, graduating in 1946. He continued his education at New York University in 1950, Harvard University in 1952, and later the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Personal life Kirsch was married to Joan (n√©e Levin) Kirsch for 65 years until his death. Together, they had four children: Walden, Peter, Lindsey, and Kara. Kirsch spent most of his professional life in Washington, D.C., where he was affiliated with the National Bureau of Standards for nearly 50 years. He moved to Portland, Oregon, in 2001 after his retirement. Kirsch died on August 11, 2020, at his home in Portland. He was 91 and had suffered from dementia in the time leading up to his death. Career In 1951 Kirsch joined the National Bureau of Standards as part of the team that ran SEAC (Standards Eastern Automatic Computer). SEAC was the U.S.'s first stored-program computer to become operational, having entered service in 1950. In 1957, Kirsch's group developed a digital image scanner, to \\"trace variations of intensity over the surfaces of photographs\\", and made the first digital scans. One of the first photographs scanned, a picture of Kirsch's three-month-old son, was captured as just 30,976 pixels, a 176 √ó 176 array, in an area 5 cm √ó 5 cm (2\\" x 2\\"). The bit depth was only one bit per pixel, stark black and white with no intermediate shades of gray, but, by combining several scans made using different scanning thresholds, grayscale information could also be acquired. They used the computer to extract line drawings, count objects, recognize alphanumeric characters, and produce oscilloscope displays. He also proposed the Kirsch operator for edge detection. Later in life, Kirsch became the director of research of the Sturvil Corporation and an advisory editor for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). He was the advisory editor of the journal Languages of Design. Accomplishments In 2003 Kirsch's scanned picture of his son was named by Life magazine one of the \\"100 Photographs That Changed the World\\" due to its importance in the development of digital photography. The original image is in the Portland Art Museum. Although Kirsch did not work for NASA, his invention led to technology crucial to space exploration, including the Apollo moon landing. Medical advancements such as Sir Godfrey Hounsfield‚Äôs CAT scan can also be attributed to Kirsch's research. ReferencesFurther reading * .

History In the late 1990s the NUKER experts had made observations with a spectroscope of two galaxies, one of an active galaxy with an active galactic nucleus called NGC10-68 and a dormant galaxy next door to us named Andromeda. The observations are shown. The light from the centre in Andromeda galaxy was distorted proving the existence of super-massive black holes. Other observations proved most galaxies had a similar centre whether it be active or dormant. They then realised that the black holes must have something to do with a galaxy's formation, so they turned to something they thought was useless: the speed of the stars around the edge of the galaxy. This is sigma, the speed of the stars at the edge of the galaxy supposedly unaffected by the mass of the black hole at the centre. Usage In Cosmology The NUKER team calculated the sigma of several stars in different galaxies and the mass of the black hole at the (nucleus) centre. They expected no correlation what so ever. But when plotting their results on a Scatter diagram and drawing a line of best fit they ended up with a positive correlation. It appeared that the heavier the black hole at the centre, the faster the stars within the galaxy travelled. This property helped them realise that a Supermassive black hole nucleus must be the reason for the galaxies in some way. They saw that the clouds of gas before the galaxies compressed forming a black hole, the black hole would produce phenomenal amounts of energy which would force the rest of the galaxy away and form stars. Sigma comes into use when the black hole gets heavier from the increased mass. The stars at the edge of the newly formed galaxy were revolving around at high speeds. The faster they were travelling, the heavier the black hole would have to be to force them away. Then once everything had been moved away from it, the black hole stops feeding. The correlation above has been proven by the process of Galaxy formation and evolution. (also see Galaxies) Formulation and Notation Sigma is given by the Greek letter sigma in lower case with star velocity in subscript (œÉŒΩ‚òâ). In physics and mathematics lower case sigma means set or group. This is appropriate for the property sigma as it is a measurement of a group of star speeds. The above correlation is given by- [(Q2+(J/M)2‚â§M2)=106*]‚âà50 km/s(œÉŒΩ‚òâ) The black hole mass equal to 1,000,000 times the mass of the Sun is approximately equal to the sigma of a star travelling at 50 km/s. The increase factor is 106n*101=xKm/s+50 km/s.

The TOD, which was founded by forest engineers who worked in stream rehabilitation, erosion control, reforestation, afforestation, establishing wild animal regeneration stations, recreation areas, etc. prepared a \\"Green Book\\" and affected Turkish society on the eve of the new Turkish constitution in 1960. Organizational objectives The overall objective of the TOD is to establish the healthy environment for today and the future and to universalize the love of nature. To reach the objective the TOD aims to contribute to the development of forestry science and technology, and contribute to solving forestry related problems with the scientific approach concerning the needs. The TOD has been organizing various non-profit activities such as seminars, panels, meetings etc. aiming to increase the consciousness for forest ecosystems and nature. The Foresters' Association of Turkey's Ecotourism Group was founded in 2000 and started organizing non- profit ecotourism and ecosystem tours and promoting ecotourism in Turkey in 2001.

It is in the Electoral Division of Glenco, in Civil Parish of Kilcommon, in the Barony of Erris, in the County of Mayo. Bellacorick has an area of: 2,789,440 m¬≤ / 278.94 hectares / 2.7894 km¬≤. Bellacorick borders the following other townlands: Killsallagh to the west; Moneynierin to the east; Muingaghel to the south; Srahnakilly to the north. During the second half of the twentieth century, it had a large turf fired power station.  History  Moorland near BellacorickIn about 1820, the civil engineer, William Bald, who was mapping the area and building roads through Erris, designed the Bellacorick Bridge, known as the Musical Bridge, it can be 'played' in two different ways: * The first way is by rolling a stone along the parapet on either side. As the stone drops along musical notes are produced in rapid succession. * The second method is to hold the stone in your hand and to strike it on the slabs which form the coping of the parapet hitting each slab as you go along and drawing back the hand immediately after striking. Each slab gives forth its own peculiar note and a musical scale is produced. The bridge was difficult to erect. Because of the remarkable soundness of the earth the foundation had to be secured by timber. It has four elliptical arches each thirty feet apart, with battlements nearly long. The Erris prophet Brian Rua U'Cearbhain referred to the then unbuilt bridge at Bellacorick in the 17th century. He said that it would never be finished and it never has been.http://www.inver.org/ceantar/des.htm The spring of 1920, the RIC police station was captured and burned by a group of IRA volunteers from Crossmolina.  Energy generation = Peat-fired power station  Peat has been Ireland's staple fuel for centuries and still provides about 12% of the nation's energy needs. In June 1949, James Kilroy TD, representing Erris, requested the government to build a turf fired power station for the generation of electricity in Erris. He also pointed out the advantage of reclaiming the bog and introducing a scheme of afforestation. The ESB acquired five and a half acres, two hundred metres from the bridge as the site for the power station. The access road was built over the ruins of the old shooting lodge. At the same time Bord na Mona bought of bogland. They harvested the turf to feed the power station. The peat was pulverised and dried in the summer. It was stored on the bog in large polythene covered piles. It was then taken to the station by railway wagons pulled by diesel locomotives. = Closure = In 2007 the massive chimney at Bellacorick was demolished for safety reasons. Even those who would have been opposed to the fossil-fuel burning power station on environmental and greenhouse gas grounds were sad to see the chimney demolished as it had become a well-known landmark for those returning home to Erris. Unfortunately, although the visually attractive chimney has been removed, the visually offensive derelict sixties-style block buildings, several storeys in height, are still standing, ungraciously draped with green netting, as a blot on the landscape. As a result, it is difficult to get a decent view of the white windmills of the windfarm at the site.  Wind farm  Since 1992 Ireland's first commercial wind farm has been operating at Bellacorick. The wind farm comprised 21 wind turbines with a total installed capacity of 6.45 megawatts and produces enough electricity to supply 4,500 households. The North Mayo area had long been identified as perhaps the best wind farm site in the country. All the key criteria for a successful wind farm project were satisfied at Bellacorick. The mean annual wind speed at the site at a height of 30 metres is 7.28 m/s. The prevailing wind direction is south-westerly and the wind blows from the south west 50% of the time. The wind regime is strong, steady winds. The ground is flat with an open aspect to the prevailing winds, resulting in virtually no loss or turbulence due to topographical features. The nearby thermal power station is linked to the National Electricity Grid. The Bellacorick wind farm is owned and operated by Renewable Energy Ireland whose major shareholder is Bord na Mona. The environmental benefits of the wind farm can be stated in terms of environmental impacts avoided through not having to generate electricity from fossil fuel sources ‚Äì coal, peat, oil and gas. Bellacorick wind farm avoids the production of 120 tonnes of sulphur dioxide, 85 tonnes of nitrous oxides and 20,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide in a year. On 16 February 2011, Capital Approval for the 400 kV Grid West Electricity Transmission Scheme (Grid West) was granted by the EirGrid Board. The project is driven by the need to connect 646.5 MW of Gate 3 wind generation at Bellacorick.Grid25 -3 EirGrid. March/April 2011. Accessed: 22 March 2012. , the project is awaiting consideration.  Transport  Bus √âireann route 446 links Bellacorick with Crossmolina and Ballina. In the reverse direction it links to Bangor Erris, Belmullet and locations on the Mullet Peninsula. There is one service a day in each direction, including Sundays. On Friday evenings an extra journey operates from Ballina. Onward rail and bus connections are available at Ballina.

The siege resulted in the death of Monis and two hostages. While Monis had a warrant out for his arrest in Iran, he sought political asylum in Australia in 1996, which was granted in 2001. Monis variously promoted himself as an Iranian intelligence official, a political activist, a spiritual healer and expert in black magic, an outlaw bikie and a Muslim cleric. He told a psychiatrist who diagnosed him with schizophrenia that he had to change his name for \\"security reasons,\\" variously calling himself \\"Michael Hayson Mavros\\",https://www.dpmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/170215_Martin_Place_Siege_Review_1.pdf (p. 72) \\"Sheikh Haron\\", and \\"Ayatollah Mohammed Manteghi Boroujerdi\\". Monis ran a \\"spiritual healing\\" business, telling some women that they needed to submit to sexual molestation to receive treatment. In 2014, Monis was charged with being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife, as well as over 40 counts of sexual assault. At the time of his death, he had recently converted from Shia Islam to Sunni Islam, and attended Islamist rallies promoting conspiracy theories about Australian security agencies. While on bail, and facing a likely lengthy imprisonment, he declared allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Life in Iran Monis was born in Borujerd, Iran on 19 May 1964. He published a book of poetry, Inside and Out or Daroon va Boroon (), in 1996 in Iran. It did not sell well, which disappointed Monis. In the 1990s, Monis ran a company called Salhani Amal (), which he used to buy discounted tyres from the Iranian government and re-sell them on the black market. He also ran a charity scam to avoid paying tax. In 2001, using the pseudonym Ayatollah Manteghi Boroujerdi, he claimed in an interview with ABC Radio National's The Religion Report that he had been involved with the Iranian ministry of intelligence and security, and that his criticism of the regime and secret information he possessed had resulted in his persecution as well as the detention of his wife and children. During an ABC Radio interview, he claimed that his family's detention was a result of views the Iranian government believed to be \\"dangerously liberal\\". David Ruteledge, the journalist who interviewed him, described this as \\"a little bit dramatic.\\" Australia granted his request for political asylum that year. He claimed that his request for asylum followed the detention of his wife and children by Iranian authorities after he espoused liberal views on Islam. According to London-based Persian TV channel Manoto 1, he had fled Iran after taking US$200,000 of his customers' money in his tourism agency. According to Iran's official news agency, he was under investigation by Interpol and Iranian police at the time he was granted asylum, and Australian police did not extradite him despite several requests. Some commentators have expressed concern regarding this immigration and citizenship process. Esmaeil Ahmadi- Moghaddam, Iran's chief of police, told reporters that Monis had \\"a dark and long history of violent crime and fraud\\" in Iran and had run a travel agency in 1996, before fleeing to Malaysia and then Australia. \\"It lasted 4 years to collect evidence on Manteghi [Monis]'s identification documents and we reported this to the Australian police but since Australia has no extradition treaty with Iran, they didn't extradite him to Iran\\". He was protected from extradition by his refugee status. Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency states that he was \\"under prosecution by the Interpol\\" and Iran provided information to the Australian government about his criminal record, mental and spiritual status. Despite this, he was granted asylum in Australia. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham publicly questioned the decisions made by the Australian government after several discussions in which Monis's criminal status in Iran was made \\"completely clear\\". Life in Australia He migrated to Australia as a refugee in 1996 seeking political asylum. He used a one-month business visa to gain entry to the country. He applied for a protection visa when his business visa expired, and was granted a bridging visa while the protection visa application was assessed.https://www.dpmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/170215_Martin_Place_Siege_Review_1.pdf (p. 21) From 1997 to 2000, Monis held a security guard licence, which would have let him carry a pistol between March and June 1997.https://www.dpmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/170215_Martin_Place_Siege_Review_1.pdf (p. 45) In November 2000, he chained himself to a pole at Parliament House, Sydney, and went on a one-day hunger strike to draw attention to his cause. He began to sexually assault women while passing himself off as a spiritual healer named 'Marcus' in the early 2000s. On 16 September 2002, Monis changed his name to Michael Hayson Mavros. While he was known as Mavros, he seemed to be 'embracing a secular life'.https://www.dpmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/170215_Martin_Place_Siege_Review_1.pdf (p. 15) He gained Australian citizenship in 2004. On 21 September 2006, he changed his name to Man Haron Monis.Martin Place Siege Review (p. 72) PDF www.dpmc.gov.au Monis was investigated by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation four times, and there were more than 40 calls to ASIO's National Security Hotline. The family of his partner called the National Security Hotline in 2010 and were advised Monis \\"wasn't a threat\\". Monis had been on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation's watch-list in 2008 and 2009, but was dropped off the list for reasons that were not specified. In 2009, in Granville, NSW, Monis gave a lecture calling for an Islamic society and taunting foreign governments saying, \\"your intelligence service is not working properly.\\" Monis lived in a flat with a housemate for six months in 1998. Monis said he was a senior member of the clergy in Iran, always locked his bedroom door, even when he went to the bathroom, and told his housemate not to bring friends over and not to answer the door if anyone knocked. Monis said that he was in \\"financial hardship\\" and borrowed payments amounting to $9,000, which were never repaid. Spouses In 2003, Monis dated Amanda Morsy for about six months, telling her he was Romanian, giving her gold necklaces and driving her to dates in a Mercedes, convertible Peugeot and a Jeep. Monis was unable to be contacted after 8 pm, claiming he was busy with his \\"spiritual consultation\\" business. Morsy described him as \\"secretive\\", \\"very reserved\\" and \\"formal\\" and wanting to \\"fit in\\". He broke the relationship off after her family expresses reservations about his personality. In 2003, Monis married a woman who was a client of his black magic business, though always kept his blinds closed, and told people at a Sydney mosque that he had a wife in Iran. In July 2011, Monis was charged at a St Mary's police station for intimidation of his ex-wife, following a confrontation in a McDonald's car park in Green Valley. His ex-wife claimed Monis had threatened to shoot her and told her that he held a gun licence. In 2010, the family of Amirah Droudis reported Monis to the National Security Hotline because they found his behaviour strange. He was secretive with the family and always refused to have his photo taken even at Christmas. He gave them the appearance of having money and being \\"very generous\\" but vague about where he worked. They described him as \\"rarely forthcoming with any direct or detailed answers.\\" Social worker Sylvia Martin talked with Monis during a meeting with his former wife in 2012. She described Monis as prone to \\"grandiosity\\" and a \\"hero in his own story\\" describing him as \\"capable of narcissism and also capable of manipulation.\\" His ex-wife said that Monis had \\"intimidated, duped and emotionally manipulated her\\" and that around 2007 he \\"became more strict\\" and told her to wear a veil, and restricted her from \\"singing and dancing\\" allegedly telling her \\"I'm doing it for Islam ... I want to be a martyr\\". =Accessory to murder charge= On 21 April 2013, Monis' ex-wife's body was found stabbed 17 times and alight in a Werrington apartment stairwell. Monis' girlfriend Amirah Droudis was formally charged with murder, and on 15 November 2013, Monis was charged by NSW Police with being an accessory before the fact and an accessory after the fact to the murder. On 12 December 2013, Monis and Amirah appeared before Magistrate William Pierce at Penrith Local Court where they were granted bail.12 December 2013 court list Penrith Magistrate Court The magistrate said there were significant flaws in the Crown's case against the pair and that \\"It is a weak case\\". Prosecutor Brian Royce said Monis' claims that the Iranian Secret Police and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) were trying to frame him for the murder were fanciful. Magistrate Pierce said all theories needed to be examined. On 22 January 2014, Monis appeared at Parramatta Local Court and, after informing magistrate Joan Baptie that he was representing himself, began discussing documents that he claimed were held by ASIO. He also claimed that ASIO was \\"conspiring against him\\" as they wanted him jailed. Magistrate Baptie told Monis that she had no power to order the release of documents held by ASIO and \\"advised him to stop talking because he would harm his defence\\". Monis staged a protest outside the court, following the adjournment of the case, \\"wearing chains and holding a sign claiming he has been tortured in custody\\". He was quoted as saying: \\"This is not a criminal case. This is a political case.\\" Claims of membership of Iranian Intelligence Monis told individuals in Australia, including his lawyers, that he had worked for the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security and had knowledge about Iran's clandestine operations, and that it was for this reason he fled Iran. However, an Iranian embassy official stated Monis' claim to have worked in intelligence and security in Iran was a lie.http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/sydney-siege-inside-the- mind-of-cbd-terrorist-man-haron-monis/story-e6frg6z6-1227162502613 Monis said he was the secretary of the Iranian intelligence department. After 9/11, Monis called ASIO saying he knew Iran was responsible and asked for a financial reward for the information. He also asked ASIO to pay him to work as an informant. Allegations of fabricated cleric status Monis proclaimed himself to be a Shia cleric. In late 2007, Australian Federation of Islamic Councils head Ikebal Patel said no Islamic community leaders knew anything about Monis and believed he \\"could be a fake deliberately stirring up anti- Islamic sentiment\\". On 28 January 2008, Australia's senior Shia leader and head of Supreme Islamic Shia Council of Australia, Kamal Mousselmani, told The Australian that Monis \\"was not a genuine Shia spiritual leader\\" and \\"there are no ayatollahs in Australia.\\" He urged Federal government officials to investigate his identity. \\"From the way he writes his fatwas (or religious edicts), I don't think he is Shia Muslim\\", he added. Psychiatric assessment In 2010 Monis was involuntarily hospitalised at Canterbury Hospital after displaying bizarre and erratic behaviour in a parking lot in Ashfield. A psychiatrist who assessed Monis said she believed he had chronic schizophrenia and needed to be on anti-psychotic medication. Monis stated that he had been forced to close his spiritual business, was $20,000 in debt, and had to change his name for \\"security reasons.\\" Monis was treated by two different psychiatrists who didn't know about the other and he was giving them different information. He was described as \\"quite guarded and reluctant to disclose too much information\\" and refused to give his phone number and home address. He was concerned that \\"ASIO and police were following him... and that some people could read his mind,\\" according to a psychologist who grew up in Iran, who diagnosed him with obsessive-compulsive disorder. He avoided buying medication for mental illness with his Medicare card to conceal his use of medication from authorities. One solicitor said that Monis seemed paranoid and would often speak with his hand over his mouth because he thought people \\"watching him\\" might be able to lip read. In an inquest held after Monis' death, Dr. Jonathan Phillips diagnosed him with narcissistic and antisocial personality disorders. Hate mail campaign Monis, together with Amirah Droudis, undertook a campaign protesting against the presence of Australian troops in Afghanistan, by writing letters to the families of soldiers killed there, in which he called the soldiers murderers, and urged the soldiers' families to petition the government to remove its troops from Afghanistan. According to Justice Dyson Heydon of the High Court, the letters compared \\"the (deceased soldier) son to a pig and to a dirty animal. It calls the son's body 'contaminated'. It refers to it as 'the dirty body of a pig'. It describes Hitler as not inferior to the son in moral merit\\". Monis was arrested on charges of \\"using a postal or similar service to menace, harass or cause offence\\". Droudis received a 2-year good-behaviour bond for \\"assisting Monis in sending the letters\\". She appealed the sentence, but on 12 March 2015 Droudis dropped her appeal. Court cases On 10 November 2009, Monis appeared in court and claimed through his lawyers to be a peace activist. He later chained himself to the courthouse in protest over the charges. Monis was subsequently barred by the courts from expanding his protest to include letters to UK soldiers' families. In an inquest, lawyer Chris Murphy said that Monis claimed to be contacting families to recruit \\"people who had suffered loss in war\\" to join his cause. Murphy said \\"He didn't strike me as very intelligent.\\" Monis chained himself to the courthouse against the directions of lawyers, and Murphy said \\"He was entirely self absorbed with his performance ... my recollection is he held a pen in the air and said 'this is my sword'.\\" Lawyers described Monis as a \\"pest\\" and a \\"dickhead\\". Manny Conditsis said that conversations with Monis were \\"draining and exhausting.\\" Monis expressed conspiracy theories about ASIO, claiming that families of dead soldiers were not upset at his letters, but \\"ASIO was putting them up to it.\\" He said \\"Monis was a very proud man,\\" who cried \\"like a baby\\" in prison. Another lawyer said he always wanted to be \\"the centre of attention\\" in the media. In December 2011, Monis appeared before the Court of Criminal Appeal in Sydney arguing that the charges against him were invalid because they infringed his implied constitutional freedom of political communication, but the three-judge panel unanimously dismissed his case. Upon further appeal to the High Court of Australia, the six-judge panel split 3‚Äì3 over the issue. Although the High Court of Australia normally comprises seven judges, one seat was vacant and as yet unfilled at the time Monis's case appeared before the court. Failing to achieve a majority vote in Monis's favour, the lower court's unanimous decision was left to stand. On 12 December 2014, Monis' appeal against his conviction for criminal use of the postal service resulted in a split decision of the High Court. The decision related to his protest against the presence of Australian troops in Afghanistan, which he expressed by sending letters to the families of soldiers killed there in which he called the soldiers murderers and urged the families to petition the government to remove its troops from Afghanistan. One of the letters compared a dead soldier to a pig and called his body \\"contaminated\\". He sent similar letters to the families of British soldiers and the mother of a government official killed by a bombing in Jakarta, Indonesia. Monis pleaded guilty and was sentenced to probation and 300 hours of community service and banned from using the Australian postal service. According to The Age, this conviction consumed him for several years, and the hostage incident followed three days after an unsuccessful attempt to have the conviction overturned. Monis had been granted conditional bail because the magistrate said \\"there were significant flaws in the Crown's case\\". Rebels Motorcycle Club Monis attempted to join the Rebels Motorcycle Club sometime in 2012 or 2013, and was photographed with a \\"1%\\" logo representing outlaw motorcycle clubs. Club members reportedly stated \\"no one really liked him\\" and described him as \\"strange and weird\\" and said \\"He would say he had a lot of money, but then he didn't have any.\\" He was kicked out of the club and Rebels took his motorbike. Sexual assault charges Monis ran a \\"spiritual healing\\" business and promoted himself as a clairvoyant and an expert in \\"astrology, numerology, meditation and black magic\\" services. Monis used the business to make unwelcome sexual advances toward vulnerable women, telling them that they could only receive treatment if they undressed and allowed him to massage their breasts and genitals. He also threatened to put curses on his victims if they refused. On 14 March 2014, Monis was arrested and charged with sexually assaulting a young woman who went to his consultancy in Wentworthville, New South Wales, for \\"spiritual healing\\", after seeing an advertisement in a local newspaper. Seven months later, on 13 October 2014, a further 40 charges were added, including 22 counts of aggravated sexual assault and 14 counts of aggravated indecent assault, allegedly committed against six more women who had visited his business. Political activity Monis promoted himself as a peace activist, and told his lawyers that his hate-mail campaign was to make families of dead soldiers support peace. Commercial news media in Sydney often condemned Monis for making videos with his girlfriend narrating, expressing happiness about the Holocaust and 9/11 and attacking rape victims. Monis hated Channel Seven for their coverage of the Muhamed Haneef affair, and ran aggressive protests outside their studios. He once rushed at television hosts Melissa Doyle and David Koch in Martin Place yelling, \\"You are a killer and a terrorist.\\" Monis would often put on clerical garb and chain himself to a post visible from the Channel Seven live studio, handing out pamphlets declaring there was a \\"War on Islam\\" - leading the network to move studios when broadcasting the Sunrise program. Following the Haneef affair, in which a doctor was accused of aiding terrorists, Monis handed out pamphlets against Sunrise alleging that they told \\"Muslim doctors\\" that \\"If you want to kill people, why not use the tools of your own trade like a plague or a disease or something?\\" Monis made complaints to Channel Seven and the Australian Communications and Media Authority, which were dismissed. Kevin Rudd publicised his consideration of changes to citizenship laws during the prosecution of Monis's letters. Monis used social media to attack politicians including then Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. His criticisms of Abbott, from 2013, related to Australia's military presence in Afghanistan. On 5 December 2014, he referred to a statement made by Rudd on changing immigration laws after Monis had been charged with seven counts of harassment. Before it was taken down, on 15 December 2014, Monis's Facebook account had 14,000 \\"likes\\". Monis featured a photograph of Osama bin Laden on his website in 2008. It has been reported that Monis was radicalised by members of Hizb ut-Tahrir. In June 2014 Monis attended a presentation by Uthman Badar and Wassim Doureihi of Hizb ut-Tahrir which was held in response to an earlier Uthman Badar lecture titled 'Honour Killings are Morally Justified', which was cancelled. Monis attended Hizb ut-Tahrir rallies and was described by Sydney Morning Herald journalist Anne Davies as \\"a little unstable. He also seemed a little creepy. Ominously, he also told me he did not think giving speeches would be enough.\\" =Seeking contact with ISIS= In October 2014, Monis wrote a letter to George Brandis' office seeking advice on the legality of communicating with ISIS. =Conversion to Sunni Islam= Monis claimed to have converted from Shia Islam to Sunni Islam.Everything We Know Now About the Sydney Hostage-Taker, nymag.com; accessed 16 December 2014. An announcement on his now-suspended website, posted a week before the Sydney siege, stated: \\"I used to be a Rafidi, but not any more. Now I am a Muslim, Alhamdu Lillah.\\" \\"Rafidi\\", which means \\"one who rejects\\" in Arabic, \\"is typically used by Sunnis to denigrate Shias as non-Muslim.\\" Monis also used his website to pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the Islamic State whose 'main enemies' are the Shi'a. On the day prior to taking a group of people hostage, Monis posted to his website: Australian Muslim commentators said that his conversion to Sunni Islam was less out of genuine religious conviction than designed to provide credibility in seeking an association with ISIL, as one \\"can't really claim to love IS when you're a Shiite and they're trying to exterminate you\\". He was a long-time self-proclaimed sheikh, albeit not recognised as such in the Islamic community. He was marginalised by Australian Muslim religious authorities and mosques for his extremist views and problematic personal and criminal history. It appears he came to espouse an extreme Islamist ideology on his own, and police and intelligence agencies have not identified any connections between Monis and international terrorist organisations. The Lindt Cafe Siege Martin Place after the event On the morning of 15 December 2014, Monis took hostage employees and customers at the Lindt chocolate caf√© in Martin Place, Sydney, across from a Seven Network television studio. Hostages were made to hold up a Black Standard with the shahƒÅdah (Islamic statement of faith) written in white Arabic text. Neighbouring buildings, including government offices and financial institutions, and Martin Place railway station, were evacuated and locked down. Some hostages managed to escape. The event lasted over 16 hours when hostages made a run for the exit with Monis firing missing all hostages. Monis then took Tori Johnston (the cafe manager) at gunpoint forcing him to kneel before firing a fatal shot into Johnston's head. Police tactical officers then decided to storm the caf√© resulting in a shootout between Monis and police in the early hours of the following morning and Monis was confirmed by police to have died in the ensuing confrontation. Two of the hostages total died, several others were wounded, and a police officer suffered minor injuries. In a website posting prior to the hostage incident, Monis denied all the charges against him, calling them politically motivated, accusing the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Australia's ASIO of framing him. No one claimed Monis's body when it was released by the NSW Coroner, and he was subsequently buried in an undisclosed NSW location at state expense. In 2016, Monis was listed under mentally disturbed individuals who have launched recent violent attacks justified with Islamist ideas or slogans. Other examples include the perpetrator of the 2016 Munich knife attack and Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, the perpetrator of the 2014 shootings at Parliament Hill, Ottawa. According to psychologists and psychiatrists who study radicalisation, jihad propaganda and calls to kill the infidels can push mentally ill individuals to act, even in the absence of direct or personal contact with Islamists. Investigations Prime Minister Tony Abbott was briefed by the Australian Federal Police on 16 December 2014 that Monis had a gun licence, but the AFP later confirmed that Monis \\"was not a registered firearms licence holder\\". A joint review has been announced by the federal and state governments, to be helmed by Michael Thawley from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and Blair Comley of the New South Wales Department of Premier and Cabinet. It will investigate the handling of the siege, and how Monis \\"slipped through state and federal security and legal nets\\". Although a call had been made to the national security hotline based on the contents of Monis' website, there were no threats of direct violence. On 16 December 2014, officers from the New South Wales Police Force and the Australian Federal Police went to the Belmore home of Monis' partner Amirah Droudis, and removed property. Her bail was revoked after a hearing on 22 December. In November 2016 Droudis was found guilty, in a judge-only trial, of the murder of Monis' ex-wife. On 29 January 2015, an inquest began into the deaths at the Lindt Cafe, presided over by the NSW State Coroner, Michael Barnes. Its aim is \\"to determine how the [three] deaths occurred, the factors that contributed to them and whether they could have been prevented\\". The joint State-Federal review was released on 22 February 2015.

There was never an actual manor (in the legal sense) nor is it an abandoned village. This is an area of dispersed settlements rather than nucleated ones.  History  East Itchenor derives its name from the Anglo-Saxon chieftain Icca, who laid claim to the shores of East and West Itchenor, as both settlements were originally known as Iccannore ('Icca's shore'). Although the Domesday Book of 1086 names the village as Icenore, by 1268 it was recorded as Estychenore and its eponymous sister village as Westichenor. The Domesday Book also makes mention of two manors in Icenore, necessitating the distinction between 'East' and 'West': the manor covering East Itchenor was owned by the Bishop of Exeter Osbern FitzOsbern and was an endowment of the College of Bosham. East Itchenor was then held by Roger de Montgomery who attached it to his manor of Birdham. There was never a separate manor of East Itchenor with demesne holdings or manor courts. Section of Robert Morden's map of Sussex from 1695, showing the location of \\"E Itchynor\\" By the 13th century East Itchenor had a chapel in its own right, better endowed than that of Birdham parish church: in a 1291 survey the rectory was valued at ¬£8.00 a year, as opposed to Birdham's ¬£5.6s.8d. Never consisting of more than a few families employed in farming on the estate its population fell so that in 1440 the Bishop of Chichester Richard Praty united its parish with Birdham.Salzmann.

Location and recreational opportunities Broderick Park, following an elongated shape, is located on the southern tip of Unity Island between the Niagara River and the Black Rock Canal. The park overlooks the Canada‚ÄìUS border and is situated within view of the Peace Bridge, which links the State of New York with the Canadian Province of Ontario at Fort Erie. Broderick Park offers recreational facilities for local residents and visitors. Under the Buffalo Micro Parks system within the City of Buffalo, contribution is made toward the maintenance and improvement of amenities. Historical significance to Underground Railroad Given the park's proximity to Canada, it is historically important in that it served as a transit area for African-Americans heading for the border on the opposite side of the Niagara River from the park. The park occupies an area that once housed docks for the Black Rock Ferry, which is known to have transported fugitive slaves to Canada as part of the Underground Railroad. These activities were particularly precipitated by the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, which to some measure brought about the 'nationalizing' of some of the consequences of the slavery practiced in the Southern states, and hence the increased flow of African-Americans travelers seeking liberty in Canada. Ironically it was Buffalo's own Millard Fillmore who, as President of the United States, signed this measure into law. (See also: Millard Fillmore - Policies.) After the American Civil War period and the Emancipation Proclamation, the Park ceased to have the same clandestine focus for traveling African-Americans. Reenactments and commemorations Reenactments and commemorations of Underground Railroad events have been regularly held at Broderick Park under the sponsorship of Buffalo Quarters Historical Society. In 2010, Broderick Park was recognized by the U.S. National Park Service as a National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom site. Recent developments Broderick Park ‚Äî visibly close to the Peace Bridge ‚Äî has sometimes been used as a backdrop to public meetings on subjects of law and administrative reform as they may relate to cross-border issues. In 2008, funding shortfalls led to an unsuccessful proposal calling for Broderick Park to be transferred from the City of Buffalo to the State of New York, to become part of a future state park. In 2012, plans were announced for a $1.5 million revitalization of the park, with plans for a new amphitheater, improved facilities, and a new memorial celebrating the park's involvement in the Underground Railroad. The project commenced in 2013.

The arms of the city have existed for some 1000 years and have changed several times during the history of Cologne. The first known arms are Per fesse dancett√© Gules and Argent. Similar arms were used during the Napoleonic era.  The Arms of the City  The arms of the city in the 16th century were Argent, on a chief Gules three crowns Or. Between 1550 and 1580, the arms were altered to Argent eleven gouttes of tar Sable (5/4/2), on a chief Gules three crowns Or. The three crowns symbolize the Magi (Three Wise Men) whose bones are said to be kept in a golden sarcophagus in Cologne Cathedral (see Shrine of the Three Kings at Cologne Cathedral). In 1164, Rainald of Dassel, the Archbishop of Cologne, brought the relics to the city, making it a major pilgrimage destination. This led to the design of the current cathedral as the earlier church was considered too small to accommodate the pilgrims. The eleven drops recall Cologne's patron, Saint Ursula, a Britannic princess, and her legendary 11,000 virgin companions who were supposedly martyred by Attila the Hun at Cologne for their Christian faith in 383. The entourage of Ursula and the number of victims was significantly smaller; according to one source, the original legend referred to only eleven companions and the number was later inflated.

This omits several poems from the first UK edition, published by Faber and Faber in 1967, including five of the seven sections of \\"Poem for a Birthday\\", only two of which (\\"Flute Notes from a Reedy Pond\\" and \\"The Stones\\") are included in the US edition. The title The Colossus comes from \\"Kolossus\\" a character who appeared in the ouija board games of Plath and Ted Hughes directing her to write poems on certain topics.Sylvia Plath 1438148445, 2013, (Journals, 409): In early July, they brought out their ouija board and spoke with their spirit, Pan, whose god is \\"Kolossus\\"; Pan told her to write about the Lorelei. 6 As a result, Plath wrote a poem, \\"Lorelei,\\" which explored her Germanic roots.Erica Wagner - Ariel's Gift: Ted Hughes, Sylvia Plath, and the Story of Birthday ... 2002 0393292673: ... she would be told that Prince Otto could not speak to her directly, because he was under orders from the Colossus. And when she pressed for an audience with the Colossus, they would say he was inaccessible. It is easy to see how her effort to come to terms with the meaning this Colossus held for her, in her poetry, became more and more central as the years passed.‚Äù Plath wrote to her mother in 1958 that ‚ÄúPan claims his family god, 'Kolossus,' tells him much of this information. #\\"The Manor Garden\\" #\\"Two Views of a Cadaver Room\\" #\\"Night Shift\\" #\\"Sow\\" #\\"The Eye-mote\\" #\\"Hardcastle Crags\\" #\\"Faun\\" #\\"Departure\\" #\\"The Colossus\\" #\\"Lorelei\\" #\\"Point Shirley\\" #\\"The Bull of Bendylaw\\" #\\"All the Dead Dears\\" #\\"Aftermath\\" #\\"The Thin People\\" #\\"Suicide Off Egg Rock\\" #\\"Mushrooms\\" #\\"I Want, I Want\\" #\\"Watercolor of Grantchester Meadows\\" #\\"The Ghost's Leavetaking\\" #\\"A Winter Ship\\" #\\"Full Fathom Five\\" #\\"Blue Moles\\" #\\"Strumpet Song\\" #\\"Man in Black\\" #\\"Snakecharmer\\" #\\"The Hermit at Outermost House\\" #\\"The Disquieting Muses\\" #\\"Medallion\\" #\\"The Companionable Ills\\" #\\"Moonrise\\" #\\"Spinster\\" #\\"Frog Autumn\\" #\\"Mussel Hunter at Rock Harbor\\" #\\"The Beekeeper's Daughter\\" #\\"The Times Are Tidy\\" #\\"The Burnt-out Spa\\" #\\"Sculptor\\" #\\"Flute Notes from a Reedy Pond\\" #\\"The Stones\\" Critical reception Prominent journalist, poet and literary critic for The Observer newspaper, Al Alvarez, called the posthumous re-release of the book, after the success of Ariel, a \\"major literary event\\" and wrote of Plath's work: > \\"She steers clear of feminine charm, deliciousness, gentility, > supersensitivity and the act of being a poetess. She simply writes good > poetry. And she does so with a seriousness that demands only that she be > judged equally seriously... There is an admirable no-nonsense air about > this; the language is bare but vivid and precise, with a concentration that > implies a good deal of disturbance with proportionately little fuss.\\"Plath, > Sylvia.

Past Successes The CRARR has been granted intervener status in two discrimination cases reviewed by the Supreme Court of Canada. One was Lavoie v. Canada (2002) which discussed giving preference to citizens over non-citizens for government jobs. As intervener, the CRARR argued that the practice was discriminatory and \\"the preference operated in a particularly invidious way with respect to women.\\" The CRARR argued that many women keep foreign citizenship out of practical considerations, such as maintain the ability to return to their former country to take care of elderly parents.Daphne Gilbert. \\"Time to Regroup: Rethinking Section 15 of the Charter.\\" McGill Law Journal. 2003, 48:639. 25 Feb 2010.

It was purchased by Ignaz Schwinn, proprietor of bicycle manufacturer Arnold, Schwinn & Co. in 1912. In 1912, an Excelsior was the first motorcycle to be officially timed at a speed of 100 mph. The Henderson Motorcycle Company became a division of Excelsior when Schwinn purchased Henderson in 1917.Hatfield, pp.76-77 By 1928, Excelsior was in third place in the U.S. motorcycle market behind Indian and Harley-Davidson. The Great Depression convinced Schwinn to order Excelsior's operations to cease in September 1931. Excelsior BigX The mainstay of Excelsior production through the 1910s and into the 1920s was the Model BigX. This had an inlet- over-exhaust v-twin engine, firstly with belt drive then with 2 speed and then 3 speed gearbox. Colors were grey with red panels in the early teens, the 'Military Model' of the late teens was in khaki (a green-brown shade) and 1920s models were in a very dark blue with fine gold pinstriping. Many were exported, Europe and Australia receiving a number of shipments. A very small number of BigX motorcycles were manufactured with engines in the 1920s. Production of the BigX continued until 1924, when it was replaced by the Super X. Excelsior Super X Excelsior released its Super X model in 1925. The Super X was America's first motorcycle with a V-twin engine. It was conceived as a competitor to the smaller Indian Scout.Pioneers of American Motorcycle Racing by Daniel K. Statnekov, Chapter 22 In response to the Super X's popularity, Indian first raised the Scout's capacity to and then introduced the new Indian 101 Scout, while Harley-Davidson introduced their motorcycle, the Model D. End of production In 1929, the stock market crash and the resulting Great Depression caused motorcycle sales to plummet. The summer of 1931 saw Schwinn call his department heads together for a meeting at Excelsior. He bluntly told them, with no prior indication, ‚ÄúGentlemen, today we stop‚Äù. Schwinn felt that the Depression could easily continue for eight years, and even worsen. Despite a full order book, he had chosen to pare back his business commitments to the core business of bicycle manufacture.

Ziarul Financiar. Retrieved May 25, 2015. In 2013, a series of deaths and injuries associated with defective Takata airbag inflators manufactured by their Mexican subsidiary Tacata Airbags led Takata to initially recall 3.6 million cars equipped with such airbags. Further fatalities caused by the airbags have led the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to order an ongoing, US-wide recall of more than 42 million cars, the largest automotive recall in U.S. history. In June 2017, Takata filed for bankruptcy. It was acquired by Key Safety Systems.  History  Takata steering-wheel in a Mercedes-Benz E-Class Takata was founded in 1933 in Shiga Prefecture, Japan, by Takezo Takada and started to produce lifelines for parachutes, and other textiles. In the early 1950s, the company started to research seat belts. Later they incorporated as \\"Takata\\". In the 1960s, Takata started to sell seat-belts and built Japan's first crash test plant for testing seat-belts under real world conditions. In the 1970s, Takata developed child restraint systems. In the 1980s the company changed its name to \\"Takata Corporation\\" and expanded internationally to Korea, the United States, and later to England, to sell seat-belts. In 2000, Takata Corporation acquired German competitor Petri AG, forming the European subsidiary Takata-Petri, renamed Takata AG in early 2012.History , Takata Corporation website. Takata AG makes steering wheels and plastic parts, not only for the automotive industry.  Recalls = 1995 seat belt recall  In May 1995, a recall in the U.S. affecting 8,428,402 predominantly Japanese built vehicles made from 1986 to 1991 with seat belts manufactured by the Takata Corporation of Japan, was begun. It was called at the time the \\"second largest recall in the 30-year history of the Department of Transportation (DOT)\\". The recall was prompted by an investigation (PE94-052) carried out by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on Takata-equipped Honda vehicles, after many of their owners complained of seat belt buckles either failing to latch, latching and releasing automatically, or releasing in accidents. It revealed that potentially faulty Takata seat belts were not limited only to Honda vehicles, but to other Japanese imports as well. NHTSA opened up a second investigation on Takata seatbelts broadly (EA94-036) as well as individual investigations on the vehicle manufacturers using Takata seat belts to determine the magnitude of the defect. This second investigation was only limited to the front seat belt buckles and in particular Takata's 52X and A7X models. This determined that a total of 11 manufacturers were affected by the investigation. Japanese models sold in the United States by American Honda Motor Co., Isuzu Motors of America Inc., Mazda Motor of America Inc., Nissan North America, Daihatsu Motor Co. American, Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America Inc. and Subaru of America Inc. also had affected seat belt buckles. Moreover, Chrysler, General Motors and Ford all had various models manufactured by Japanese companies with the seat belt buckles concerned, but sold under American names such as the Dodge Stealth and the Geo series (except Prizm) under General Motors. Ford had vehicles such as the Probe manufactured by Mazda on its MX-6 platform and the Festiva made by Kia in South Korea, but engineered by Mazda that also had the seat belts. However, unlike Chrysler and General Motors, Ford did not admit that their seat belts could be defective. Initially, some Japanese manufacturers suspected that the seat belt failures were a result of user abuse, rather than a design failure; however, the nine-month investigation by NHTSA concluded that the cause of the defect was that the buckles were made of ABS plastic. Through exposure to ultraviolet light over a period of time, the plastic became brittle and pieces fell off, causing a jamming of the release button mechanism. The manufacturers involved agreed to a voluntary recall, though this did not go smoothly. Only 18% of the 8.9 million cars and trucks with the Takata belt buckle were repaired two years after the recall had begun. In addition, NHTSA assessed a $50,000 civil penalty against both Honda and Takata for failing to notify the agency about the seat belt defect in a timely manner. Honda was fined because NHTSA believed the company knew about the hazard at least five years before the recall, but never reported the problem to NHTSA, nor offered to conduct a voluntary recall.  Defective airbag recalls (2013‚Äìpresent)  Takata began making airbags in 1988 and, as of 2014, held 20 percent of the market. During 2013, several automakers began large recalls of vehicles due to Takata-made airbags. Reports state that the problems may have begun a decade before, with the faulty airbags placed in some Honda models starting in 1998. Honda stated they knew of more than 100 injuries and thirteen deaths (seven in the United States plus six in Malaysia) that were related to Takata airbags. In April and May 2013, a total of 3.6 million cars were recalled due to defective Takata airbags. All of those airbags were made at, or otherwise used inflator units manufactured by, Takata's Monclova Plant in Coahuila, Mexico, operated by Takata's North American/Mexican subsidiary, TK Holdings Inc. In November 2014, BMW announced they would move any orders from the Mexican plant to a Takata plant in Germany. In June 2014, Takata admitted their Mexican subsidiary had mishandled the manufacture of explosive propellants and improperly stored chemicals used in airbags. Identifying vehicles with defective airbags was made more difficult by the failure of TK Holdings Inc. to keep proper quality control records. That prompted another round of recalls in June 2013. In their statement the company said, \\"We take this situation seriously, will strengthen our quality control and make a concerted effort to prevent a recurrence\\". On June 23, 2014, auto manufacturers BMW, Chrysler, Ford, Honda, Mazda, Nissan, and Toyota announced they were recalling over three million vehicles worldwide due to Takata Corporation-made airbags. The reason was that they could rupture and send debris flying inside the vehicle. This was in response to a US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) investigation that was initiated after the NHTSA received three injury complaints. In a statement on June 23, 2014, Takata said they thought excessive moisture was the cause of the defect. Haruo Otani, an official at the vehicle recall section of the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, said that moisture and humidity could be seeping inside inflators, destabilizing the volatile propellant inside. In July 2014, a pregnant Malaysian woman was killed in a collision involving her 2003 Honda Civic which contained the defective airbag. The woman, aged 42, died when a metal fragment from a ruptured driver's airbag sliced into her neck in the accident in which she was driving at around 30 km/h (18 mph) when another vehicle hit her at a junction, according to a lawsuit filed by her father at a Miami federal court. Her daughter, delivered after the mother's death, died three days later. On November 18, 2014, the NHTSA ordered Takata to initiate a nationwide airbag recall. The action came as 10 automakers in the U.S. recalled hundreds of thousands of cars equipped with potentially faulty air bags manufactured by Takata. As of May 19, 2015, Takata is now responsible for the largest auto recall in history. Takata has already recalled 40 million vehicles across 12 vehicle brands for \\"Airbags that could explode and potentially send shrapnel into the face and body of both the driver and front seat passenger\\". This recall will bring the number up to about 53 million automobiles eligible for this recall. In November 2015, Takata was fined $200 million ($70 million paid upfront) by U.S. federal regulators in response to Takata's admission of a fault. Toyota, Mazda and Honda have said that they will not use ammonium nitrate-based inflators. On May 4, 2016, the NHTSA announced recall campaigns of an additional estimated 35-40 million inflators, adding to the already 28.8 million inflators previously recalled. On January 13, 2017, the United States charged three Takata executives, Shinichi Tanaka, Hideo Nakajima and Tsueno Chikaraishi for Takata's exploding airbags. The company agreed to plead guilty and to pay $1 billion to resolve the investigation, which includes a $25 million fine, $125 million for victim compensation and $850 million to compensate automobile manufacturers. At least 16 deaths are linked to the defective airbags. On 28 February 2018 the Australian Federal Government announced the compulsory recall of all cars fitted with Takata airbags. \\"About 2.3 million vehicles will be subject to the compulsory recall and the airbags must be replaced within two years.\\" On 1 March 2018, it was announced that 106,806 Volkswagen vehicles, including models such as the Golf, Passat, Polo, CC Eos, and 'Up!', have been recalled for containing defective Takata airbags. On 2 March 2018, Holden announced that the airbag recall now includes 330,000 of their Australian vehicles, despite not originally having any of their cars in the federal government's compulsory recall list. On 4 April 2018, the New Zealand government, having decided \\"they present the highest safety risk to drivers and passengers,\\" announced a compulsory recall of 50,000 vehicles fitted with Alpha-type Takata airbags. This compulsory recall is said to be only the second in New Zealand's history and the largest vehicle recall of its kind. The Ministry of Commerce and Consumer Affairs stated that it will also block the importation of any vehicles whose faulty airbags have not been replaced. On 28 June 2018, Transport Canada announced the recall of 222,336 Honda vehicles manufactured between 2001 and 2007 that previously had their front passenger airbags modified under the original Takata airbag recall of 23 June 2014. The modifications done to the original airbags feature a non- desiccated inflator, which could rupture upon deployment, causing metal inflator fragments to pass through the cushion material, causing injury or death. Honda did not replace the airbag in the original recall. Honda is replacing these airbags with units that feature a desiccated inflator. On 4 December 2019, Takata recalled another 1.4 million front driver inflators in the U.S., according to government documents. On 17 December 2019, The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) issued a new warning affecting around 78,000 cars manufactured between 1996 and 2000 of the following makes; Audi, BMW, Ford, Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Suzuki and Toyota. = Cars affected = As of December 9, 2016, car manufacturers affected by this recall include Acura, Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Daimler Trucks North America, Daimler Vans USA LLC, Dodge/Ram, Ferrari, Fisker, Ford, GMC, Honda, Infiniti, Jaguar, Jeep, Land Rover, Lexus, Lincoln, Mazda, McLaren, Mercedes-Benz, Mercury, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Pontiac, Saab, Saturn, Scion, Subaru, Tesla, Toyota, and Volkswagen. In 2014, BMW, Chrysler, Ford, Honda, Mazda, Nissan, and Toyota notified the NHTSA that they were conducting limited regional recalls to address a possible safety defect involving Takata brand air bag inflators. In May 2014, General Motors expanded their earlier recall of their 2012 Chevrolet Cruze sedan and other models because of an electrical problem with the Takata airbags. The recall also included the Buick Verano, the Chevrolet Sonic and the Chevrolet Camaro. On June 25, 2014, General Motors told their North American dealers to stop selling their 2013 and 2014 model Chevrolet Cruze sedans. GM stated, \\"Certain vehicles may be equipped with a suspect driver's air bag inflator module that may have been assembled with an incorrect part.\\" The airbags involved were made by Takata Corporation. On June 11, 2014, Toyota recalled 2.3 million vehicles, many for the second time. On July 17, 2015, Ferrari issued a recall for their lineup from the 2014-15 model years due to the driver's side airbags being improperly installed and the leather covering them improperly glued. This was discovered when the company was conducting tests on a 458 Italia and the airbags would deploy at a rotated orientation, potentially causing injuries. Ford added certain models to the list after the 10th death occurred when the airbag in a 2006 Ford Ranger pickup driven by a Georgia man ruptured violently in South Carolina, in late December 2015. On January 4, 2019, Ford issued a recall for an additional 953,000 vehicles, including 782,384 in the United States and federalized territories and 149,652 in Canada. Affected vehicles included 2010 Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX, the 2010 and 2011 Ford Ranger, the 2010 to 2012 Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKZ, the 2010 and 2011 Mercury Milan, and the 2010 to 2014 Ford Mustang. This was a planned expansion of previously recalled vehicles as identified earlier by the NHTSA. Takata claimed that the issue has only been shown to affect vehicles in hot and humid locations. However, all potentially affected vehicles have been recalled as a precaution. No evidence of the issue has been seen in the UK or Europe. Nearly all reported injuries (both fatal and minor) had been recorded in Honda vehicles, something which is undergoing investigation.  Bankruptcy  On June 25, 2017, Takata filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States and filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan, owing more in compensation than is possible for its survival. The surviving assets are to be sold to its largest competitor, Chinese owned and U.S. (Michigan) based Key Safety Systems, for about $1.6 billion. On April 11, 2018, following the completion of Key Safety System's acquisition of Takata, the company announced that the company would be renamed to Joyson Safety Systems, and continue to operate in Michigan as Key Safety Systems.

He was subsequently the penultimate Duke of Bouillon succeeding his father in 1771. Biography The younger of two children, he was born to the Duke and Duchess of Bouillon in 1728. He had an older sister, Marie Louise (1725‚Äì1793) who later married the Prince of Gu√©m√©n√©. Styled the Prince of Turenne as the heir apparent to Bouillon, he married Princess Louise Henriette Gabrielle de Lorraine on 27 November 1743. She was a member of the house of Lorraine and a great grand daughter of Henri, Count of Harcourt. The couple had four children in all before Louise Henriette Gabrielle died in 1788; three children pre-deceased them. The widower Duke married again in 1789 to Marie Fran√ßoise Henriette de Banastre (1775‚Äì1816), a girl who was some forty-seven years younger than he. No children were produced from the marriage. He served with distinction in the Seven Years' War. In 1748 he was made a mar√©chal de camp. He was elected to the Royal Academy of Sculpture and Painting in 1777. In just three months, he squandered almost a million livres on his mistress, an opera singer, thus bringing his family to the verge of ruin. He died at the Ch√¢teau de Navarre on the eve of Revolution and was succeeded by his eldest son Jacques, who was an invalid. Jacques was the last Duke of Bouillon, the title being abolished during the French Revolution. The Princes of Gu√©m√©n√© today claim the Duchy of Bouillon as their own due to the marriage of Marie Louise (his only sibling) and Jules de Rohan, Prince of Gu√©m√©n√©. He has no known descendants.

The series began in 1988 with Europress' Lombard RAC Rally game and ended in 2002. Each game in the series had many different front covers. Lombard RAC Rally (1988)  In 1988, Europress released Lombard RAC Rally for the Atari SThttp://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-st-lombard-rac-rally_22603.html and Amigahttp://www.lemonamiga.com/?game_id=1581 under their Mandarin Software label. This was based on the same rally (under the earlier sponsors' names) as the later Network Q RAC Rally games. The game prominently featured an animated driver, seen from behind moving the steering wheel, with the road seen through the car's windscreen. Network Q RAC Rally (1993) Five years after Lombard RAC Rally, in 1993 Europress released Network Q RAC Rally for MS-DOS. Network Q RAC Rally Championship (1996) The next game in the series was called Network Q RAC Rally Championship. It was released for MS-DOS and Windows in 1996. This new version has more tracks, cars, and better graphics. A 1997 version also came, which included a X-Miles add-on and some newer features. This version was published by Actualize instead of Europress. International Rally Championship (1997) International Rally Championship came in November 1997, and became available for Windows and PlayStation. New features arrived, such as Track Editor and playable up to 8 players via LAN. Mobil 1 Rally Championship (1999) Mobil 1 Rally Championship came in December 1999, for Windows and PlayStation. The Windows version of the game has been viewed as one of the most realistic game, due to very high quality graphics for its time, unlike the unsuccessful PlayStation version. Rally Championship Xtreme (2001) Rally Championship Xtreme came in November 2001 for Windows. It was not really as successful as its predecessor. Rally Championship (2002) The sixth game of the series was called Rally Championship. It was released for PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube in May 2002. It was the last of the series.

Based on the novel A Very Private Gentleman by Martin Booth, it was loosely adapted to screenplay by Rowan Joff√©. The film was released on September 1, 2010. Plot Jack, a gunsmith and contract killer, and his lover, Ingrid, are relaxing in Sweden. As they walk in the wilderness outside their cabin, Jack becomes alarmed by a trail of footprints in the snow and pulls Ingrid towards shelter. Sniper gunshots ring out. Ingrid sees Jack pull a gun from his pocket and shoot the sniper. Knowing his identity is in jeopardy, and with little hesitation, Jack shoots and kills Ingrid before locating and killing another armed man. He flees to Rome and contacts his handler, Pavel, who insists that Jack cannot stay in Rome. Pavel sends him to Castelvecchio, a small town in the mountains of Abruzzo. Jack becomes nervous, and disposing of the cell phone Pavel gave him, goes to nearby Castel del Monte instead‚Äîwhere he uses the name Edward. While in Abruzzo, Jack contacts Pavel, who sets him up with another job. He meets Mathilde, an assassin who wants him to build her a custom sniper rifle. He also begins patronizing a prostitute, Clara, and they begin a relationship separate from her business duties. Jack meets with Mathilde to test the weapon. She is impressed by the craftsmanship, but asks him to make a few more adjustments. Later, Jack realizes that he is being followed by an assassin from Sweden, whom he kills. Jack is tormented by dreams of the events in Sweden and regrets killing Ingrid. His friendship and conversations with a local priest, Father Benedetto, encourage him to question his life choices. Both Mathilde and Clara notice Jack's association with butterflies, Mathilde by his expertise in endangered butterflies and Clara by his prominent tattoo. When Father Benedetto tells Jack he senses he lives in a special kind of hell, \\"a place without love\\", Jack starts to let himself feel love for Clara, and envisions a life with her. Jack talks to Pavel one last time‚Äîasking how the Swedes have found him. In his growing fear, he even suspects Clara when he discovers a small pistol in her purse. He questions Clara about the gun and is satisfied with her explanation (to defend herself, since newspapers have reported murdered prostitutes). Jack agrees to deliver the weapon to Mathilde as his last job, but at the last moment, he re-opens the briefcase. At the drop-off, Jack becomes suspicious that Mathilde plans to kill him. Before anything can happen, a busload of school children arrives. Mathilde gives Jack his payment‚Äîa thick envelope full of cash‚Äîand the two separate. As Mathilde drives away, Pavel contacts her and asks if she has killed Jack. She tells him she has not, but says she is following him and will kill him. Clara meets Jack at a religious procession in town. Jack asks her to go away with him and she agrees. Mathilde tries to shoot Jack from a nearby rooftop but the rifle backfires in her face, confirming Jack's suspicion and his last-minute decision to sabotage the rifle. Seeing Mathilde fall from the roof, Jack gives Clara the envelope full of cash and tells her to go to a river where they had picnicked and wait for him. He runs to Mathilde, who is dying on the pavement, and discovers that she also works for Pavel. As Jack goes to meet Clara, he hears Pavel behind him. They exchange gunfire and Pavel drops dead. As Jack drives to meet Clara at the river, he feels his abdomen and realizes he has been shot. Jack arrives at the picnic spot and as he sees Clara, he collapses. Clara screams and runs to the car. A white butterfly flits skyward from Jack's car.

As the Clooney character drives from Rome to Castel del Monte, there is an impressively long drive through the 4600-meter long San Domenico Tunnel (Galleria San Domenico) that is between the exits of Pescina and Cocullo on the A25 highway that connects Rome to Torano and Pescara. The car driven by Jack in the movie is a Fiat Tempra with Pescara licence plates. The film's \\"most romantic moment\\", according to director Anton Corbijn‚Äîwhen Jack takes Clara to a restaurant of her choice, their \\"actual date\\"‚Äîwas filmed at a restaurant in Pacentro, near Sulmona. The comic-acting waiter in this restaurant scene was directed to stand in front of a two-bulb lamp fixture so that he appeared to have \\"devil's horns\\". Photographs on the restaurant's walls are reportedly all of lovers of Gabriele d'Annunzio. Clara orders Montepulciano d'Abruzzo wine for the dinner, and Corbijn said the film's company enjoyed many of the fine wines of the region during the months of production there. The film score was written and composed by German singer- songwriter (and longtime friend of Corbijn) Herbert Gr√∂nemeyer. A 1967 song called \\"Window of My Eyes\\" by the Dutch blues band Cuby & the Blizzards is played over the ending credits. The aria \\"Un bel d√¨ vedremo\\" (\\"One fine day we'll see\\"Google translate) from Puccini's opera Madama Butterfly can be heard in the background of one scene, and \\"Tu vu√≤ f√† l'americano\\" in another. In another scene the Italian song \\"La Bambola\\" by Patty Pravo plays. Western films and other influences Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), with Henry Fonda facing off as villain in a gunfight, is playing on a television on the back wall of a modest restaurant where Jack has been eating. In the DVD commentary, Corbijn notes this homage and says the American Western‚Äîand more specifically the Italian-American spaghetti westerns by Leone and others‚Äîwere explicit models for The American. Corbijn also notes the Ennio Morricone scores made famous in Once Upon a Time in the West, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly (1966), and other films.Director commentary on DVD. Retrieved July 22, 2011. Speaking of the narrow, labyrinthine streets of the Italian hill towns where much of the action of The American occurs, Corbijn says he was thinking, in filming, of the streets of Venice and the way they appeared in Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now (1973). Large segments of the dialogue between Jack and Clara are taken verbatim from Graham Greene's novel The Honorary Consul (1973). Release=Marketing The first official poster was released on June 17, 2010. The first trailer was attached to Robin Hood and the second official trailer on June 19, 2010, and was attached to Jonah Hex, Grown Ups, Inception and The Other Guys. Box office The film grossed US$13.1 million, opening at number 1, ahead of Machete, which grossed US$11.4 million on the Labor Day weekend. The American grossed a total of US$67,876,281 worldwide‚ÄîUS$35,606,376 in North America and US$32,269,905 in other territories. Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating 65% based on 214 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website's critical consensus states: \\"As beautifully shot as it is emotionally restrained, The American is an unusually divisive spy thriller‚Äîand one that rests on an unusually subdued performance from George Clooney.\\" On Metacritic the film has an average score of 61 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"D‚Äì\\" on an A+ to F scale. This was attributed to disappointment after the film was marketed as being action- packed instead of focusing on suspense and drama. Rolling Stone's Peter Travers gave the film two-and-a-half stars, writing that director Anton Corbijn \\"holds his film to a steady, often glacial pace\\", and that the result is of \\"startling austerity\\". Roger Ebert gave the film four stars, writing, \\"Here is a gripping film with the focus of a Japanese drama, an impenetrable character to equal Alain Delon's in Le Samoura√Ø, by Jean-Pierre Melville.\\" Leonard Maltin called it a \\"slowly paced, European-style mood piece, short on dialogue and action and long on atmosphere\\".

History The hydrological distribution of the Maas changed during the later Middle Ages, when a major flood forced it to shift its main course towards the Merwede river. However, during another series of severe floods the Maas found an additional path towards the sea near Geertruidenberg, resulting in the creation of the Biesbosch wetlands and Hollands Diep estuaries. Thereafter, the Maas split near Heusden into two main distributaries, one flowing north to join the Merwede, and one flowing directly to the sea. This latter branch is the current Oude Maasje. The branch eventually silted up, and in 1904 a new parallel channel was dug in the drainage basin, the Bergse Maas. This channel then took over the functions of the silted-up branch, which has since been known as the Oude Maasje. At the same time, the branch leading to the Merwede was dammed at Heusden, (and has since been known as the Afgedamde Maas) so that the vast majority of water from the Maas now enters the old Hollands Diep estuary, rather than mixing with the Rhine distributaries. Like many old river beds in the Netherlands, the Oude Maasje now primarily acts to drain the surrounding fields, and does not receive water from the Maas river. However, it drains into the Bergse Maas near Geertruidenberg, therefore retaining a connection with the Maas.

Crane Skywave SSB Battery Operated Portable Travel Radio AM, FM, Shortwave, NOAA Weather Alert, Scannable VHF Aviation Band and Single Side Bands C. Crane is an American electronics retailer based in Fortuna, California. The company mainly deals in specialty radio and lighting equipment and is best known for its GeoBulb line of LED light bulbs. History C. Crane was founded in 1976 in San Francisco, California by Bob Crane, a former cabinetmaker, and his wife Susan Crane. The \\"C\\" is Crane's middle initial, as well as his wife's and children's.http://www.northcoastjournal.com/080405/cover0804.html The company was initially a furniture design and manufacturing company and only switched to being an electronics distributor in 1983, upon the Cranes' relocation to Fortuna. C. Crane's first electronics product was the \\"Select-A-Tenna\\", an antenna manufactured by Intensitronics Corp. of Hales Corners, Wisconsin, for long-distance reception of AM radio broadcasts. The company advertised on late-night radio shows, which served to increase business from AM listeners looking for a better antenna. Later in the 1980s, C. Crane began to distribute radios, such as the GE Superadio, to go along with their antennas. In the 1990s, Bob Crane decided to move the company toward designing its own products, rather than just retailing what was already out there. Following the 1992 Cape Mendocino earthquakes, the company expanded their catalog to include emergency radios and other disaster equipment, such as flashlights. Eventually, C. Crane began to produce its own radios in collaboration with Sangean. At the present radio division of C. Crane specializes in weak signal reception and developed many products to improve the reception of weak radio and internet signals. C. Crane also focuses on high quality audio. GeoBulb In 1998, C. Crane introduced the \\"CCTrek\\" flashlight. This flashlight used two white LEDs as opposed to an incandescent bulb. Realizing the amount of energy LEDs save over regular light bulbs, the company developed and released an LED light bulb in 2001. This was followed in 2006 by the GeoBulb project. The GeoBulb, based solely on LEDs, was released on March 27, 2009. The company claims the bulb has a lifespan of 10 years and draws only 7.5 W of power, and predicted widespread adoption of the bulb would cut energy usage worldwide by one-tenth. Initially, the bulb is targeted at owners of public buildings that need to be lit continuously, in order to save costs associated with having to purchase and replace incandescent bulbs. Reviews of the bulb reflected positively on its energy usage and lifespan but criticized the lights' unnatural color and their high cost when compared to standard incandescent and compact fluorescent bulbs.

Some notable alumni include Adil Khan, Denzil Franco, Micky Fernandes and Pratesh Shirodkar. Till date, more than 150 players have benefited from SFA's programs, out of which some have played internationally and many others have represented various prestigious clubs of the country. Football Programs= Residential Academies  Sesa Football Academy presently runs two residential campuses ‚Äì Sanquelim campus, which began its functioning in June 1999; and Sirsaim campus, which was established in June 2008. Both academies are fully residential with on-site accommodation and all other amenities required for the development of a footballer, including gym, medical facilities, nutrition and boarding facilities, recreational facilities, etc. Students are also given orientation in sports medicine, physiological assessment and physiotherapy. The academy is AIFF-accredited, and hosts the AIFF Youth Leagues at their campus. Since they are firmly entrenched in the Vedanta Group's CSR activity, SFA does not charge its students, and all expenses related to student welfare, education, transportation, etc. are borne by SFA. = Sanquelim Campus = The Sanquelim campus, with 36 players, is a four-year residential program admitting 18 students every two years. It is built on the Sanquelim reclaimed mine site, with a beautiful football ground, well-established gymnasium, and a complete hostel facility along with a recreation center. = Sirsaim Campus = To further nurture the young talent with football training and to provide a disciplined regime, new infrastructure at Sirsaim was inaugurated on 14 February 2010. Constructed at an approximate cost of Rs. 4 crores, it has state of the art infrastructure at international standards. The Sirsaim academy currently has 30 trainees in its four-year residential program, with a batch of 15 trainees admitted every two years. = Staff = To guide the technical aspects of both academies, a UEFA Pro License Coach, Eduard Batlle Basart was roped in as the technical director. He has previously worked with the youth teams at European giants Manchester United and FC Barcelona. Sesa Football Academy has a full-fledged staff including two Head Coaches who plan and execute the training program, along with the support of doctors, physiotherapists, and other staff to assist and manage the affairs of the teams and the academies. Arjuna awardee and ex-Indian captain Brahmanand Sankhwalkar is the Chief Mentor of Sesa Football Academy.  Vedanta Football Schools  In line with its objective of identifying and promoting young talent, SFA launched Vedanta Football Schools in 2012 to identify boys from nearby schools under the age of 14 years, and provide them non-residential football training. This is in line with the larger vision of community development in the areas where Vedanta operates. Currently SFA operates 4 football schools, at Majorda, Nuvem, Sanguem and Thivim. These centers have proved to be a feeding pool for the academy, with 6 students from these schools making it to the residential academy. thumb  Vedanta Women's League  Working towards the aim of women empowerment through football, Sesa Football Academy launched the Vedanta Women's League in 2017, with the support of Goa Football Association. The league was inaugurated by then Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar in the presence of eminent women's football legends. The Vedanta Women's League has since completed two seasons, with over 200 girls given an opportunity to play football. The winner of the 2018 edition, Panjim Footballers, went on to play in the Indian Women's League as the sole team from Goa.

Panganiban was a prolific writer, with over 1,000 works to his name (textbooks, dictionaries, books, poems, short stories, articles, plays, etc.). Among his textbooks were Pagsusuring Pambalarila; Panitikan ng Pilipinas; Comparative Semantics of Synonyms and Homonyms in the Philippine Language, and publications such as Diksyunaryong Pilipino-Ingles; Concise English-Pilipino Dictionary; Thought, Language, Feelings; Isip, Wika, Damdamin; a collection of poetry, Mga Butil na Perlas; 101 Tanong at Sagot na Pangwika; 90 Painless Lessons in Pilipino; Tanaga, Haiku, Pantun and many more. Thirty-two years of research produced two Thesaurus-Dictionaries: Diksyunaryo-Tesaurong Pilipino- Ingles and the Thesaurus-Dictionary English-Pilipino, considered to be his magnum opus. Early life In 1903, Geminiano Panganiban, a lawyer, pharmacist and a non-combatant lieutenant in the Philippine Revolutionary Army, had to surrender to the U.S. Expeditionary Forces in Northern Luzon because his wife, Policarpia Villa, from Caloocan Rizal, a descendant of Emilio Jacinto of the revolution, was pregnant. The couple was placed in a concentration camp in what is now Bautista, Pangasinan. There, Jose Villa Panganiban was born on June 12, 1903, five years to the day after Gen. Aguinaldo proclaimed Philippine independence from Spain in 1898. In 1911, JVP‚Äôs mother died and in 1917, father and son returned to Geminiano‚Äôs hometown in Tanauan, Batangas where the father remarried Fidela Collantes of the prominent Collantes clan. Marriage JVP married his childhood sweetheart, Consuelo Torres from Tanauan, Batangas in 1930. ‚ÄúCons‚Äù, as he fondly called her, co-authored two dictionaries with her husband. Their 42 years of marriage produced 5 children: Jose Jr. (+), Rosamyrna (Carandang), Virgilio (+), Consuelina (Dominguez) and Ligaya (Gamboa). Director of the Institute of National Language from the time of Pres. Magsaysay up to Pres. Marcos, Panganiban was also a professor at the University of Sto. Tomas, Manuel L. Quezon University & the Philippine Normal College. Among others, he founded the UST periodical, Varsitarian; was president of the Akademya ng Wikang Pilipino of the UNESCO; member of the Philippine-Japanese Trade Negotiations of 1960 and held many key positions in government and civic organizations. JVP received numerous National and International awards and citations for literature, journalism, etc., the earliest international award being the Richard Reid Award for Journalism while on post graduate scholarship at the Notre Dame University in South Bend, Indiana in 1940. In 1999, a Jose Villa Panganiban Varsitarian Professorial Chair was established by the University of Santo Tomas. Love of Pilipino In expressing his love for a national language, both orally and in writing, JVP became a controversial advocate of Pilipino as the ‚Äúwikang pambansa‚Äù. His detractors called him ‚ÄúDiktador ng Wika‚Äù, ‚ÄúHigh Priest of National Language‚Äù, ‚ÄúEmperador ng Wika‚Äù, ‚ÄúCzar ng Purismo‚Äù and ‚ÄúFrankenstein ng Purismo‚Äù. On the other hand, his allies called him ‚ÄúBayani ng Wikang Pambansa‚Äù. JVP was neither a dictator nor a purist. He wrote in 1970: ‚ÄúMultilingualism would be a solution to our linguistic problems. It would erase colonialism.. it would eliminate regionalism.. it would create nationalism. In the mutual contact of languages, foreign and local, the most useful form of national language will surface and will become the real PILIPINO.‚Äù Unfortunately, it was not until months after his death that the 1973 Constitution established Pilipino as one of the two official languages of the Philippines ‚Äì the other being English. In 1987, the Constitution stipulated that the National Assembly was to take steps toward the formation of a genuine national language to be called Filipino, which will incorporate elements from the various Philippine languages.

He married an English wife, Violet Withers, by whom he had two sons, Nicolas Mavroleon and Manuel Basil Mavroleon, generally known by his nickname \\"Bluey\\" (1927/1932‚Äì2009), who was educated in England and served in the Grenadier Guards.

As it is located close to the former Pl√∂tzensee Prison, the church-building was designed as a memorial for the victims of National Socialism. The paintings Pl√∂tzenseer Totentanz (Pl√∂tzensee Danse Macabre) painted by the Viennese artist Alfred Hrdlicka are an important part of this church. The Gemeindezentrum Pl√∂tzensee  Building and architecture  The church and the church-centre were built in the years between 1968 and 1970 for congregants living in the recently built Paul-Hertz-settlement in this area. The architects Gerd Neumann, Dietmar Gr√∂tzebach and G√ºnther Plessow created the buildings, which include a church, a day-care facility for children, a youth centre, apartments, offices and other rooms for congregational use. The church premises were designed as a place of memorial from the beginning. Alfred Hrdlicka created the Dance of Death of Pl√∂tzensee, which shows motifs similar to medieval dances of death on 16 boards. The paintings point at today's threats by violence, power and arbitrary. The architecture shows influences of ideas that came up during a reform-period of the Protestant church in Germany during the 1960s: the benches are arranged in a square (quadrangle) around the altar in the centre. This was meant to create a feeling of community among those who worship in here and to involve them more intensely in the service. Almost contradicting to this intention the architecture of the church refers to the prisons of Pl√∂tzensee: the cupola made of concrete reminds the worshiper of a prison cell; light comes only from a single window right above the altar.  Ecumenical activities  There is a close Ecumenical cooperation with the nearby Roman Catholic memorial church Maria Regina Martyrum and the Carmelite monastery adjunct to it. This cooperation is especially dedicated to remember the martyrs of Pl√∂tzensee. The most important ecumenical memorial events of these churches are the Ecumenical Pl√∂tzensee Days every January and the annual anniversary of the assassination-attempt of 20 July 1944. In summer 2009 the Ecumenical Memorial Centre Pl√∂tzensee - Christians and Resistance has been founded in the Protestant Church of Pl√∂tzensee.

The band is composed of vocalist Bret Constantino, guitarists Matt Holliman and Evan Reiss, and drummer Brian Tice. The band has released five studio albums to date, the most recent of which, Private Tales, was released in June 2017. Biography Sleepy Sun formed as Mania in 2005 at UC Santa Cruz by students Bret Constantino, Matt Holliman, Evan Reiss, Brice Tice and original bass player Hubert Guy. Holliman, Reiss and Tice all lived on the same floor during their freshman year. The band progressed from their original garage rock stylings into psychedelia, and changed their name to Sleepy Sun in 2007, with the addition of former Birds Fled from Me singer Rachel Fannan. The band set to work on their debut Embrace in 2008 which they self released via their own record label/publishing company Sol Diamond, and received favorable reviews. Shortly after the release of the album, Guy left the band and was replaced by new bass player Jack Allen. The album was re-issued by ATP Recordings on June 16, 2009. The band toured heavily throughout 2009 in support of the album, with their live show becoming a subject of acclaim. In March 2010, they embarked on a tour of the United States, opening for the English rock band Arctic Monkeys. They were personally asked to support Arctic Monkeys, after the girlfriend of the band's bassist heard a song on a covermount CD and got the band to listen to it. The band released their second album, Fever on June 1, 2010. The album was recorded in Vancouver, Canada in April 2009 with producer Colin Stewart who also worked on the band's debut album. Holliman commented that \\"Fever and Embrace were written back to back. After recording Embrace we moved to San Francisco and started writing the tracks that would eventually arrive on Fever. This writing took place before Embrace was officially released by ATP and before we started touring full time. So if there's a feeling of continuity between the two, it's simply because there was little to no time between their inception\\". Fannan departed the band mid tour citing mental health reasons. In late October, she released a press release in which she cited a lack of input into the band's creative process and conflicts with other band members as the reasons for her departure. She stated that \\"I had a fun time with them for the first year but after several attempts to contribute my ability to play keys, or write music were ignored I gave up hope and started drinking more. There‚Äôs a whole year and a half of my life I barely remember.‚Äù The band declined to comment on her departure, but Constantino later stated that \\"She's a really beautiful person in a lot of ways. I learned a lot about myself.‚Äù Fannan returned to Los Angeles where she formed the band Only You and began a career in voice acting. In 2011, Sleepy Sun went on tour with The Black Angels. The band released their third album Spine Hits on April 10, 2012. Aside from Still Breathing, the album was recorded in seven days at Hicksville Trailer Park and Rancho De La Luna in Joshua Tree with producers Ethan Allen and Dave Catching. Catching had previously guested on the band's previous album, laying down a guitar solo on V.O.G.. The first album without Fannon, Constantino commented that after her departure ‚ÄúWe kind of went through a transitional phase for about a year, and the record is a part of that transition to adapting to life without Rachel. We always wrote the songs without Rachel so that wasn't really a part of it, but from a live performance perspective she was a big part of the live show, and there were certain parts on the records where the female vocal was the only thing that could be there, so we kind of had to rediscover ourselves, and that record is a part of that experiment\\". A more straight ahead album that previous releases, Constantino revealed that the band \\"labored over the structure of this record and the songs that are on it\\" and that \\"lyrically, especially, I think we really tried to convey more succinct story lines and character studies while still preserving the ambiguity in the words and the message\\". He also added that \\"I think we‚Äôve always covered a brand range of genres, our influences, but this record was a conscious effort with more cohesion\\" and that the songs were \\"little bit lighter and easier to digest\\". In late 2013 during downtime from Sleepy Sun, Evan Reiss and Matt Holliman formed Fine Points and released their debut album Hover in July 2015. Constantino works as a cook to supplement his income, and Tice works as a math and physics tutor, teaches Micro Controllers and also consults on prototyping projects. On January 28 2014, the band released their fourth album Maui Tears. Prior to recording the album, the band signed to Dine Alone Records who were fans of the band and contacted them with the proposal of working together. The album was recorded with producer Tim Green at his studio in Grass Valley, California. Constantino described the album as being \\"spacey and very heavy at times, it's very dreamy, and I would hope that it's more transcendent\\" that the previous album. Towards the end of the sessions, Constantino moved to Texas and now has to commute between there and San Francisco for rehearsals. In July 2015, the band announced that they had finished recording their fifth album, and the following month revealed they were mixing it. However, in December stated that the album was still a \\"work in progress\\" and were still finishing it off in late January 2016. On March 21, 2017, the band published a new publicity shot which confirmed the departure of bassist Jack Allen. They are set to release their fifth studio album Private Tales in June 2017. The album features both former member Jack Allen and Owen Kelley on bass. Kelley is a member of Fine Points with Reiss and Holliman. The album also sees the band resume work with engineer and producer Colin Stewart, who worked with the band on their first two albums.

Her keel was laid 17 April 1942, launched 4 August 1942 and commissioned on 24 November 1942. History  Immediately after being commissioned Laurel was stationed at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania until 8 October 1943 when she was reassigned and stationed at Boston, Massachusetts. There she joined her sister ships , , and . She was used primarily for cargo and passenger transport and for escort and icebreaker duties in Greenland waters. For a brief time, from 3 September 1946 to 8 December 1946 Laurel was stationed at Portland, Maine. On 8 December 1946 Laurel was reassigned to Rockland, Maine and used for maintaining navigational aids, search and rescue operations and ice breaking. On 4‚Äì5 January 1953 she towed fishing vessel Estrella to Gloucester, Massachusetts. On 27 May 1957 she towed fishing vessel Regina Maria to Rockland, Maine, and on 7‚Äì8 August 1958 was the on-scene operational commander following a collision between cargo ships and SS Gulfoil at the entrance to Narragansett Bay during a heavy fog. On 10 January 1959 she assisted fishing vessels Bobby and Harvey off Rockland, Maine, on 13‚Äì14 March 1959 she assisted disabled lobsterman Betty Lu, on 25 November 1959 she assisted the tug Alta May and tow near Rockland, Maine, and on 4 July 1967 she recovered the wreckage and bodies from a private plane that had crashed into the water off of Moose Point, Maine. On 21 May 1969 Laurel was reassigned to Morehead City, North Carolina to continue her duties as a buoy tender and search and rescue vessel. On 22‚Äì28 January 1970 she helped fight a fire on the Norwegian motor vessel Thordis Prethus off the North Carolina coast. In the fall of 1974 Laurel underwent a minor renovation before being reassigned in January 1975 to Ketchikan, Alaska. While in Ketchikan she was used for maintaining navigational aids, search and rescue operations, icebreaking, law and treaty enforcement and securing US territorial waters. In September 1983 she was moved again to San Pedro, California. In addition to her usual duties she was used for MX missile tests, NOAA buoy deployments and mine-laying. In May 1984 Laurel sustained major damage to her main motor and was towed to Point Loma by the Coast Guard cutter . From July 1986 to 1990, Laurel had major renovations to machinery, living spaces and superstructure under the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP). New main General Motors diesels were installed, new generators, propulsion systems, new vang supported boom system (eliminating the distinctive Cactus-class, A-frame boom support), marine sanitation system, navigational electronics and more. Following SLEP, Laurel was dispatched to Mayport, Florida where she continued her buoy tender duties until she was decommissioned on 1 December 1999 and sold at GSA auction. By 2014, Laurel had been converted into a party boat and renamed Coral Vision, now homeported in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago.

The assistant director to Fitzmaurice was William Scully. The film marks the second screen appearance of the actor Henry Stephenson. The film was based upon the play We Can't Be as Bad as All That by Henry Arthur Jones. According to the American Film Institute catalog, William Cameron Menzies may or may not have been the art director for the film. Plot Based upon a plot summary included in a film review in a film publication, Nora (Ferguson) is an American heiress who is courted by Lord Bissett (Gamble) while visiting England. She overhears Bissett discussing with his sister the need of Nora's money to replenish his fortune, so she leaves him and moves into a nearby cottage. A successful playwright Sir Howard Furnival (Stephenson) assists her in preparing a play based upon a novel she has written, but keeps this secret from his wife Doris (Dean), who is very jealous. Bissett obtains a page of the manuscript in Nora's handwriting with enduring terms, and gives it to Doris, telling her that it is a love letter to her husband. This leads to the deaths of both Furnivals, and Nora is blamed and ostracized. Nora changes her name and goes to Venice, where she meets and becomes engaged to English army officer Sir Ralph Newell (Carleton). Before their marriage she confesses who she is in a letter that he never receives. Upon return to England, she discovers that her husband is the brother of Doris and has cursed the woman who caused his sister's death. Bissett reveals to Newell who Nora is.

When it was created, many sites in Europe only had access to BITNET or compatible networks, and not to the Internet. Therefore, there was a great need to access files that were available only on the Internet. The TRICKLE server allowed anyone on the BITNET-compatible networks to access hundreds of thousands of files from many popular FTP servers around the world. The TRICKLE server was a 'concentrator' of FTP sites into central servers. Each server had its own (large) cache disk to store files that have been recently ordered by users, and was in communication with all other TRICKLE servers about the contents of its cache. When a user ordered a file that is not in local cache, TRICKLE could usually forward this command to one other TRICKLE server that was known to hold the file. In some cases, \\"broadcasts\\" to all other TRICKLEs for this file is necessary, and if the file is new, or accessed very infrequently, it was requested from one of the 3 FTP slave-servers it had. These 3 were special servers who fetch the file via FTP and send it via NJE to TRICKLE. TRICKLE servers reduced load on FTP sites substantially: Their incoming-to outgoing file rate was usually 1/5. Meaning, each cached file was usually sent out five times during its lifetime in the cache disk. TRICKLE supported a wide range of delivery methods to the user. Besides the usual email+(UUE, XXE, BTOA, etc.), it could also FTP the files to the user, or use NJE SENDFILE where possible and desired. It was possible to subscribe to file patterns, such as SCAN and to have the server deliver you a new copy of the file each time it is made available. A special keyword, '*' could be used instead of the pattern to subscribe to an entire subdirectories, like: * At its heyday, TRICKLE processed thousands of requests daily, delivering many gigabytes of software to its users. The server allowed users anywhere around the world to request files from an FTP server on the Internet via a gateway server which was connected to both networks. It was intended to enable the more widespread distribution of (what was then referred to as) Public Domain software from the SIMTEL20 and about a dozen other repositories (hence the command /PDGET, see below). The software was originally written by Turgut Kalfaoglu at the Turkish national node TREARN (Ege University,Izmir) and was rapidly mirrored at many other BITNET nodes including AWIWUW11 (Austria), BANUFS11 (Belgium), DKTC11 (Denmark), DB0FUB11 or DTUZDV1 (Germany), IMIPOLI (Italy), EB0UB011 (Spain), TAUNIVM (Israel) and others. To use the service, BITNET users would type a command to their local machine which would forward the remainder of the line as a command to the TRICKLE server. The syntax of the forwarded command was similar to those used on LISTSERV but prefixed with a slash: TELL TRICKLE AT node /PDGET file (mode where was the BITNET node hosting a TRICKLE gateway; was the directory and file required; and ( specified the file transfer mode (e.g. UUE). On BITNET VAX systems the local syntax was SEND TRICKLE@node. An example command would look like: TELL TRICKLE AT TREARN /PDGET MADMAX.ARC It also accepted commands sent via email; any number of commands would be put in the body of the message. The target file was optionally divided into 64Kb chunks after zipping and UUencoding to alleviate congestion on the BITNET network, which used a store-and-forward transmission model where files in transit were sorted into ascending order of size at each intervening node. This enabled very small files to travel reasonably quickly, leaving larger ones to queue for later (e.g. overnight). It was the receiving user's responsibility to piece together the chunks in order for reassembly into the full UUencoded file for decoding and unzipping. TRICKLE used a distributed cache database - that is, it only kept one copy of each requested file in Europe and each TRICKLE server was aware of each other's files. If anyone asked for any of those files, it would be sent from whichever TRICKLE server happened to have it. This alleviated the load on the saturated international links (esp. Europe-USA), and permitted rapid delivery of popular files. Users could also subscribe to file patterns, using a command like /SUB SCAN* for example, and each new matching file that appeared in the repository would automatically be sent to the user. TRICKLE also had the ability to create \\"newsletters\\" and mail them out to subscribers - it contained information about each new file that was added to the repository. Likewise, users could send the /NEW command and get a list of the newest additions to the archives. The server also knew of which servers were closest to their users, and forced users to use their local server. However, if that server was detected to be down, then any other server accepted commands from the users of that region. TRICKLE was written in REXX programming language (over 40k lines of code) and in Assembler. It ran on IBM VM/CMS systems, Contact: Turgut Kalfaoglu turgut (at) kalfaoglu.com For this server, Turgut Kalfaoglu was awarded European Academic and Research Network's Software of the Year award.

The Vaartse Rijn was formerly a major shipping route between Utrecht and the Rhine basin. History In 1122, Bishop Godebald of Utrecht dammed the Kromme Rijn where it branches from the Nederrijn at Wijk bij Duurstede. In the Roman period, The Kromme Rijn had been the main channel of the Rhine river, but by this stage was a minor distributary, most water flowing in the Lek and the Waal distributaries. The Kromme Rijn was dammed to prevent inundation of the Bishop's land holdings near Wijk bij Duurstede. The dam on the Kromme Rijn severed the shipping connection between Utrecht and the Rhine hinterland, and the citizens of Utrecht therefore decided to dig a canal restoring the connection. The first phase of construction of the Vaartse Rijn, (also called the Rechte Rijn in contrast to the Kromme Rijn) began in 1127, making it one of the oldest canals in the Netherlands.C. J. A. Bruynel (2001), De derde meander, blz. 18, Jaarboek Oud-Utrecht 2001, PlantijnCasparie Utrecht, The first stretch was dug between the moat surrounding Utrecht and Liesbosch (currently part of the town of Nieuwegein. In the middle of the 12th century, the Vaartse Rijn was extended in the direction of the Hollandse IJssel, (the so-called Doorslag canal). At its junction with the Hollandse IJssel, a lock protected the canal from inundation. At the time, the Hollandse IJssel was in open connection with the Lek river, a major distributary of the Rhine. In 1285 Floris V, Count of Holland dammed the Hollandse IJssel connection between the Lek and the Hollandse IJssel. In order to maintain the connection between the Utrecht and the Lek, Floris ordered the construction of a new stretch of the Vaartse Rijn (the \\"Nieuwe Vaart\\"), to meet the Lek directly at Vreeswijk. In 1373 the Vaartse Rijn was deepened, and a lock installed at Vreeswijk.

Life Born on March 17, 1643 in Rome, he was the son of Orazio Spada and Veralli Maria. He was also a great-nephew of Cardinal Bernardino Spada and a nephew of Cardinal Giambattista Spada on his father's side, and a nephew of Cardinal Fabrizio Verallo on his mother's side. His sister, Eugenia Spada (1639‚Äì1717) married Girolamo Mattei, Duca di Giove of the House of Mattei. Spada completed his studies as a doctor of law (\\"in utroque iure\\") at the University of Perugia in 1664; after which he took holy orders on December 22, 1669. He was subsequently appointed referendary to the Apostolic Signatura and Lay Abbot of the monastery of Santa Maria d' Attilia, in the diocese of San Severino. In 1672 he became titular Latin Archbishop of Patras but had to obtain a dispensation because he was still below canonical age, and papal nuncio to the duchy of Savoy. On August 14, 1672, he was consecrated bishop by Gasparo Carpegna, Cardinal-Priest of Santa Pudenziana with Alessandro Crescenzi (cardinal), titular Latin patriarch of Alexandria, and Bernardino Rocci, titular archbishop of Damasco, serving as co- consecrators. Two years later on January 3, 1674, he was appointed Apostolic Nuncio to France. Pope Clement X created him cardinal-priest in the consistory of 27 May 1675, and he was given the titulus of San Callisto. This was exchanged in 1689 for that of San Crisogono and in 1708 for that of Santa Prassede. He was appointed legate to Urbino in 1686 and served as Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals from 1688 to 1689. Finally he achieved his most senior appointment as Cardinal Secretary of State, serving from 1691 to 1700 under the papacy of Innocent XII. In 1710 he became cardinal-bishop of the Roman see of Palestrina. Other titles included Prefect for the Congregation of Good Government (now suppressed), archpriest of the Basilica of St. John Lateran, and Secretary for the Holy Office or Inquisition from 1716 until his death. As cardinal he also participated in the papal conclaves of 1676, 1689, 1691 and 1700.

Description and history The Elisha Blackman Building is located at the southwest corner of York and Chapel Streets in downtown New Haven. It is a four-story masonry structure, built out of red brick with stone trim. The building is trapezoidal rather than rectangular, due to the shape of the lot it occupies. The ground floor has one storefront and the main building entrance on the York Street facade, and three on that facing Chapel Street. The Chapel Street storefronts are separated by stone columns, while the York Street storefront has brick pilasters separating the storefront, building entrance, and the bays occupied by the corner store. The upper floors have most windows set in rectangular openings; there are projecting polygonal window bays on both facades. It has a metal clad cornice. and The building was built in 1883, on land that had previously been occupied by three houses. Its designer is unknown, but the craftsmanship and material quality is high. The building was an investment by Elisha Blackman, a carriage maker. In the 1920s, the second floor was adapted for professional offices instead of apartments, and the building facade was pushed out to the sidewalk, supported by lally columns and steel supports. There was a fire in the building in 1977 and the building was vacated.

He is a citizen of the United States and Lithuania. Roots and early life Keys was born 25 June 1946 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, USA. His father worked as a plumber and sold kitchen supplies. His mother was of mixed English, Scottish and Irish ancestry, and was a housewife and clerk typist. Athletics and music were an important part of the household. As a child, Keys spent a good deal of time fishing and hunting with his father, and tramping the mountains around their family hunting cabin near Pine Grove Furnace State Park and Fuller Lake. Keys often mentions the Blue Mountains, and these outdoor activities, as an influence on his poetry. Keys attended racially mixed inner city public schools. Soul music, bluesy rock, \\"hillbilly\\" tunes, and especially jazz all combined to influence Keys's poetry. Another influence from this period was the Sunday sermons of Christ Lutheran's minister, Pastor Rudisill. Profession In 1964, Keys attended the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia on several scholarships given partly as a result of a new \\"quota\\" system the Ivy League institution was using to recruit \\"Colored folk\\" and the economically disadvantaged. He took a leave-of-absence after his sophomore year (1968) and joined the Peace Corps for a two-year stint as an agricultural assistant in the south of India in the town of Devarakonda near Hyderabad. Here he read dozens of books and after reading Garc√≠a Lorca, Val√©ry's essays, and Tagore decided to become a poet. He also delved into Hindu religion and philosophy. And at this time the seeds were planted for his polyphonic epic poem, \\"A Gathering of Smoke\\", first published by P. Lal in Calcutta, and later by Three Continents Press in Washington, D.C. in 1986. Returning to Penn in 1968, he majored in English literature and took his B.A. in 1970. During those final two years, Keys was influenced by reading English-language poets particularly Shakespeare, Donne, Keats, Dylan Thomas, Yeats, Wallace Stevens, and especially Pound's Cantos. Other major influences at this formative time were Joyce, Jung, Pablo Neruda, Whitehead, Nagarjuna, Thoreau, Chuang-Tzu, and Bachelard and Husserl. After graduation, the poet lived in Center City, Philadelphia for two years. He began to read poets of the 1950s and 1960s, many in the anthology Naked Poetry, and in Robert Bly's literary journal, The Fifties and The Sixties. Of considerable importance were Gary Snyder and W. S. Merwin and early Robert Lowell, Ted Hughes, and Antonio Machado. During this time, Willis Barnstone's Modern European Poetry Anthology became a reference for further reading, and spurred Keys on to enroll in graduate school at Indiana University at Bloomington, Indiana, where Barnstone taught. Shortly before matriculating, Keys married Ann Fletcher James, a Temple student from the Harrowgate/Fishtown area of Philadelphia. While at Bloomington, Keys became close friends with the poet, Robert Bringhurst. He was perhaps the only contemporary to exert an influence on Keys‚Äô poetics other than the poet, Michael Jennings. Keys earned his M.A. in English Literature in 1973. In 1973, Keys returned to Pennsylvania determined to write poetry and do little else. Bringhurst joined him briefly after inaugurating Kanchenjunga Press with his first book of poems, The Shipwright's Log (1972). The next book published was Keys‚Äô Swallowtails Gather These Stones (1973). That was soon followed by Keys‚Äô second book of poems, Jade Water (1974), designed and published by Bringhurst. Failing to attract the attention of major publishing houses, Keys resorted to publishing his own material. From the early 70s to the mid‚Äì80s, Keys and Bringhurst maintained an extensive correspondence now housed in Keys' archives at Dickinson College in Carlisle, where he was an honorary Associate Fellow for 12 years, and at the National Library of Canada in Ottawa, Ontario. It was Keys who first brought Bringhurst to Gary Snyder's attention; Bringhurst wrote a foreword to his reissued study of a Haida myth, He Who Hunted Birds in His Father's Village (2007). Robert Bly also visited the poet at this time and encouraged him to move to Brazil, a move that Keys and his wife were already planning. From 1974 to 1978, he lived in Rio de Janeiro, teaching, translating, and writing poetry. While in Rio, Keys became friends with Carangola and L√™do Ivo and soon began translating Ivo and Jo√£o Cabral de Melo Neto who were published by New Directions. Some years later a selected collection of L√™do Ivo's poems, Landsend (1998), was published by Keys‚Äô Pine Press. He also organized and edited a bilingual anthology of contemporary North American poetry, Quingumbo, published in S√£o Paulo. In 1977, Keys and his wife returned to Pennsylvania where he lived for nearly two decades. He spent two more years in Brazil (Salvador). In 1983‚Äì84 he did research on African-Brazilian liturgy on a Senior Fulbright grant. At the behest of the Brazilian novelist, Jorge Amado, Keys resided in the neighborhood of Rio Vermelho. During that time, the Keys divorced and remarried the Bahian, Valdenice dos Reis Almeida‚Äî\\"Ziza\\". He published many collections of his poetry during this period. They covered a variety of themes including: India, Brazil, the Tao Te Ching, flamenco, Central America and the Pennsylvania hill country. In these poems, Keys continues his phenomenological and lyrical exploration of Dasein in regard to etymology, rapture, and metaphor. Like Auden and other prolific poets, Keys writes songs, light verse, limericks, pithy satiric squibs, erotica;, ideograms, haiku, epigrams, parodies, and enigmatic epiphanies and riddles. His prose wonderscripts and plays are dense, and often dark and absurd. His children's books verge on fables. From the early 70s to the mid-90s Keys' relationship with the artist and flamenco guitarist, Frank Rush Miller (Paco de Nada) was important. They were close colleagues and friends, lived together for a while, and on occasion performed in tandem in Pennsylvania, Spain, Central America, and Brazil. Another important link was his friend, the poet Gerald Stern, beginning in the mid-70s. Stern, came to live in rural Perry County at Keys‚Äô invitation, and wrote many poems evoking the landscape, such as the much anthologized poem, \\"Nice Mountain\\" which visits the \\"great open space\\" that Keys homesteaded. Other poets who became close during this time included J. C. Todd (Jane Todd Cooper) and Craig Czury. Keys also gained a reputation as a reader of poetry, performing for academic and caf√©-bar scene audiences. He was the American Poet-in-Residence at the Iowa International Writing Program for two semesters, and also worked then (and now) as a cultural and language facilitator for international visitors from abroad. Keys divorced again in the mid-1980s and then lived for some half-dozen years with the singer-songwriter, and textile artist, Janet Pellam \\"invented\\" a method of binding Pine Press books using a Singer sewing machine with the poet. In 1992, he received the Robert H. Winner Memorial Award from the Poetry Society of America. During the 70s and 80s, Keys occasionally taught English literature, grammar, composition and poetry at Penn State University, Harrisburg Area Community College (where he co-founded and co- directed the Wildwood Poetry Festival) and Dickinson College. With no health insurance and a severe injury to his leg and back while felling trees, Keys began toying with idea of a move to Europe. He visited Croatia and what was then Czechoslovakia. He was soon was spending considerable time in Olomouc with the Czech poet Petr Mike≈°. In 1996 he journeyed to Wroc≈Çaw to visit the Polish poet, Urszula Kozio≈Ç, and then on to visit Leszek Engelking, a poet and Pound and Nabokov's Polish translator, living near Warsaw. There he met and established a close relationship with Mexican expat poet, Gerardo Beltr√°n (Zorro) and with Lithuanian poet, Kornelijus Platelis (Zapata). They later became known as the Three Z's, Keys having been dubbed with the sobriquet, Zopi, in Tela by the Garifuna community. He moved to Vilnius in 1998 to teach translation theory and creative composition for two years as Fulbright professor at Vilnius University and Vilnius Pedagogical University. He producing \\"Singer\\"-sewn books for Pine Press with the budding Lithuanian Press, Vario Burnos, under the direction of the book-designer Tomas Butkus. Younger Lithuanians were introduced to books by Toma≈æ ≈†alamun, Charles Bukowski, Vytautas Blo≈æe, Jo√£o Cabral de Melo Neto, Michael Jennings, Brian Young, Bill Shields, J. C. Todd, Craig Czury, Hailji, and others. He also held poetry readings at his Hermescort Saloon-Salon. The poet was married for a brief time to the Lithuanian presidential archival photographer, D≈æoja Barysaite. From 1998 to the present, Keys has lived for the most part in Vilnius, publishing, editing, translating from Lithuanian and Portuguese, and writing poetry, plays, children's books, and wonderscripts. Two books of his poetry‚Äîone a bilingual, selected, Vultures‚Äô Country, and the other, Tao te ching Meditations, Bones & Buzzards‚Äîwere published in the Czech Republic, assisted by Czech poet, Petr Mike≈°. Two books in Lithuanian with commentary by poets Kornelijus Platelis and Sigitas Geda were also published. Keys' chapbook and book translations of Lithuanian poets include works by: Eugenijus Ali≈°anka, Sonata Paliulytƒó, Jonas Jackeviƒçius, Sigitas Geda, Laurynas Katkus, and others. Keys has helped to produce Lithuanian-English editions of Selected Poems, The Banks of Noon, by Emily Dickinson (translated by Sonata Paliulytƒó), and Selected Poems of Menke Katz' English-language poems, collaborating with Menke's son, the Yiddish scholar Dovid Katz. At the same time he published books in America: one with the Virtual Artists Collective, and three with Presa S Press. The most recent include Transporting (2010), with cover artwork by the Paris-based Brazilian painter, Gon√ßalo Ivo, whose artwork is also found on Pine Press books from the 90s, and a book of poems, Night Flight, 2012. Since the mid-90s, Keys‚Äô poems and translations have been published in European journals and in the USA. By deconstructing his own poems, he has performed throughout Europe and Russia with the Russian/Lithuanian free-jazz percussionist and constellation artist, Vladimir Tarasov. They released a CD with Prior Records in 2006. Recently he performed as Biblical Chronicler and Speaker in Tarasov's and Frido Mann's multimedia project, The Flood, and has also ventured into voicing an interactive audio-e book for children, Strawberry Day, by Kestutis Kasparaviƒçius. He has received translation and book-art laureates in Lithuania and is a member of the Lithuanian Writers Union and PEN. He was the Writer in Residence for SLS Lithuania for several years. Keys is also the World Ambassador to Poetry from the Republic of U≈æupis, and maintained and wrote the \\"Dispatch\\" literary column from the Republic for Poetry International, SD. He resides in Vilnius with the Lithuanian poet, translator, and former actress, Sonata Paliulytƒó, and their two children.

The Sun has run frequent stories under the \\"Broken Britain\\" theme since 2007. Whilst the phrase is essentially a political one, the frequency of these stories has decreased since the Conservatives came to power in 2010.  Political usage  David Cameron had referred to \\"Broken Britain\\" during his time as leader of the Conservative Party, and pledged to \\"fix\\" Broken Britain during the campaign for the 2010 general election. In September 2009, The Sun announced that it would back the Conservatives in the 2010 election, having supported the Labour Party in 1997, 2001 and 2005, stating that Labour had \\"failed on law and order\\". Iain Duncan Smith published two reports, \\"Breakdown Britain\\" and \\"Breakthrough Britain\\", dealing with similar themes, through the Centre for Social Justice. By contrast, The Guardian ran a series of articles in 2010 questioning this theme, under the title \\"Is Britain Broken?\\". The Conservatives also came under criticism after publishing an inaccurate figure in a report on teenage pregnancy and crime rates. After the 2011 England riots, David Cameron alluded to many of these themes while speaking on the UK's \\"moral collapse\\". Under the banner of \\"Broken Society\\", he listed: \\"irresponsibility, selfishness, behaving as if your choices have no consequences, children without fathers, schools without discipline, reward without effort, crime without punishment, rights without responsibilities\\".  In popular culture  A number of films released from 2006 featured the theme of Broken Britain. They include Ill Manors, Harry Brown, F (film), Eden Lake, Cherry Tree Lane, The Disappeared, Summer Scars, Outlaw, The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael and Heartless. The 2000 AD story Cradlegrave also played with similar \\"hoodie horror\\" themes.

The lake is fed by geothermal springs below the surface that range in temperature from . Surface water temperatures usually range from but occasionally go higher. The springs lie along the Steens fault zone, which runs north-south through the Alvord Valley east of Steens Mountain. Borax lake chub, Gila boraxobius The lake contains high concentrations of borax (sodium borate), as well as arsenic and lead. Despite this, it is home to a unique species of fish, known as the Borax Lake chub. The species was formerly threatened by development of geothermal energy in the vicinity. However, in 1993 The Nature Conservancy bought of private land, including the lake, in order to protect it; the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has designated near the lake as critical habitat, and the Steens Mountain Cooperative Management and Protection Act of 2000 put the area around the lake off-limits to geothermal exploration and mining. The lake and nearby wetlands and water bodies such as Alvord Lake, north of the small community of Fields, provide important bird habitat. History Aerial view of the lake In the late 19th century, a mining company called Rose Valley Borax bought the springs and the land around it. The borax salts emanating from the springs had collected on the surface and formed a low dome a across. The company mined the borax for about 10 years. Wagons pulled by mule teams delivered the borax to a railway terminal in Winnemucca, Nevada. Ruins of buildings associated with borax mining, which ended here in 1902, remain near the lake in the 21st century. Interest in mining for boron and other substances in the Alvord Lake basin rose again in the 1940s and 1950s. A geologist who took samples from hot springs in and near Borax Lake (then also called Hot Lake) reported in 1960 on the prospects for resumed commercial mining in the area. He estimated the total accumulation of borates from Borax Lake and another nearby hot springs at about a year.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The district covers the southwestern corner of Downtown New Haven, including properties from Park Street to Temple Street between Chapel and Crown streets, and properties from High Street to Temple Street between George and Crown streets. It is bordered on the north by the New Haven Green and the Yale University campus. The western edge borders the Dwight Street Historic District. The eastern and southern edges of the district abut areas of more modern development. In 1984 the district included, over a 5 and a half block area, 102 buildings, of which 76 were contributing buildings. The predominantly brick structures represent a wide range of architectural styles. Maps show that the area was residential in the eighteenth century and through the first quarter of the nineteenth century. Commercial development began to take over at that time, though residential properties remained well represented. The oldest building in the district is the Ira Atwater House, built in 1817. Most of the buildings now in the district were built in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, having replaced earlier residential and commercial development. One of the oldest surviving commercial buildings in the city is a c. 1831 building on Church Street.

Festival is a music festival for up-and-coming Danish bands held annually in the Meatpacking District of Copenhagen, Denmark. First arranged in 2003, it showcases around 100 bands and soloists from the growth layer of Danish music. History The festival was born in 2003 as a happening aiming to attract attention to the need for better practice facilities for bands in Copenhagen's Vesterbro district. This initiative developed into the Vesterbro Festival which gradually grew larger, in 2008 attracting 20,000 visitors. In the same time, the festival established as an important exhibition window for emerging bands, forming a serious alternative to the √Örhus-based SPOT Festival. To reflect this role and give the festival a more international profile, the name was changed to the current Start! Festival in 2009. In the same time, the programme was extended and various other initiatives taken, including the formation of the Start Academy, the festival's programme to promote the development of musical talent at band level. Stages The festival currently has a total of six stages: * A large outdoor stage * Two indoor stages in √òksnehallen * An electronica/club stage with an emphasis on visuals * A Singer-songwriter * A small hard rock stage Years=2009 The festival took place from 4 - 6 June and featured 100 bands selected among more than 1,200 applicant bands. Participating acts included Phil Shivers, Mislyd, Coco Moon and Ginger Ninja. Of established names, Johnny Deluxe, Mani Spinx and Mike Sheridan. 2010 The festival took place from 10‚Äì13 June and included 100 bands which had been selected from more than 1,200 bands through an internet-based selection process. The festival opened on 10 June with Striving Vines and closed at 3 am on 13 June with Egger & Stunn. Some of the bands had already experienced airplay on Danish radio;including The Floor Is Made Of Lava, Alcoholic Faith Mission, Stoffer og Maskinen and The Wong Boys--while others are still fairly unknown.

The manga was written by Japanese manga author Tsutomu Takahashi. Published in December 2001, the 240 page graphic novel follows the story of Izuko, a beautiful and mysterious \\"Guardian of the Gate\\" to the Afterlife. Izuku guides troubled souls who pass through, presenting them with three choices: to ascend to Heaven to await reincarnation; to deny their death and wander the earth as a ghost, or to seek vengeance upon the person who caused their death or suffering‚Äîbut the consequences of that, no matter how justified, is to be condemned to Hell. Sequels include and . Both sequels were published while the series was in production and at the height of its popularity. Plot Izuko (Yumiko Shaku) is a beautiful and mysterious gatekeeper to the afterlife. Known as the Guardian of the Gate, Izuko guides spirits of the recently departed on their journey...sometimes to Heaven, other times to Hell. The decision is theirs and it is not always an easy one. Often the spirit is the victim of a murder or other untimely death. In such case, a soul is offered three options: 1) accept their death as it is and proceed into Heaven to await reincarnation. 2) Wander the Earth as a ghost. 3) Take justice into their own hands and face the gates of Hell. Most episodes (see Episode List below) involve the guest starring character seeking to discover what happened to them and why‚Äîwith Izuko attempting to guide them on the correct path. To her sadness and despite her compassion, Izuko does not always succeed and the moral dilemma is often very grey and unfair.

There are about 80 teachers at Aalborg Cathedral School and approximately 760 students who are assigned to 24 high school classes and 6 Higher Preparatory Examination (HF)-classes. History The exact date of foundation is not known, but historical documents indicate that in 1540 King Christian III of Denmark gave the school a wing of the old Hospital of the Holy Ghost, Aalborg (Hellig√•ndsklostret i Aalborg) after the dissolution of the Danish monasteries. For many years the church was an integral part of the school but in 1814 it moved from the monastery buildings in Jomfru Ane Gade. In 1886‚Äì1889 the school moved to its current location in a newly built school in Sct. J√∏rgens Gade (orig. Saxogade), designed by Vilhelm Theodor Walther (1819-1892). The school was rebuilt during 1924‚Äì1926 under the direction of architect Einar Packness (1879-1952) and expanded 1959‚Äì1960 under design by Leopold Teschl (1911‚Äì1989). The school has since been expanded several times, including in the 1980s, when the sports hall and science wing was built after drawing by Kj√¶r & Richter. Recently, a completely new building was built with 10 new classrooms, so that the school is now better equipped to meet the new teaching methods, which are a part of secondary education and higher preparatory reform. The school's main building is newly refurbished including a library and study centre on the ground floor. The first Danish resistance group during World War II ‚Äì Churchill-klubben ‚Äì consisted of pupils from Aalborg Cathedral School. Their actions inspired the 1994 book The Boys from St. Petri (New York, NY: Puffin Books, 1996) by Bjarne Reuter. Alumni have included publisher S√∏ren Gyldendal (1742‚Äì1802), historian Johan Ludvig Heiberg (1854- 1928), architect J√∏rn Utzon (1918‚Äì2008) and the current Lord Mayor of Copenhagen, Frank Jensen.

In memory of this event his widow, Elizabeth of Carinthia, founded the monastery about 1310-11 at the site, approximately from Brugg. The monastic complex centered around the contemplative life of the nuns, while the small community of friars tended to both their spiritual needs and that of the surrounding community.K√∂nigsfelden , Staatsarchiv AargauThe foundation of the convent of K√∂nigsfelden , Kanton Aargau Albert and Elisabeth‚Äôs oldest daughter, Agnes of Austria, the widow of King Andrew III of Hungary, moved to K√∂nigsfelden in 1317 and helped it to thrive, but did not join the monastery.Zwei habsburgische Frauen mit Wirkung: K√∂nigin Elisabeth und K√∂nigin Agnes von Ungarn , Staatsarchiv AargauQueen Agnes and the convent , Kanton Aargau With the conquest of the Western Aargau by the city of Bern, the monastery lost its connection with the Habsburg family. It was abolished in the course of the success of the Reformation in Switzerland in 1528. The complex then served as the seat of the Bernese bailiffs of the K√∂nigsfelden district, a steward took over the administration of former monastic property. In 1804 the former monastery became the property of the canton of Aargau, which had been founded in the year before. The new canton established a mental hospital. In 1872 a new building was built and since 1887 it has been a psychiatric clinic. During the construction a large part of the Franciscan monastery was demolished.

Dizzie Tunes was a Norwegian musical show group from the city of Skien. Dizzie Tunes was one of the most successful in Norwegian show business.  Biography  The group was founded as the dance band Rex Band in 1959, was named Dizzie Tunes in 1962, and disbanded in 2002. The regular group members were Yngvar Numme, Svein-Helge H√∏gberg, √òyvind Klingberg, Tor Erik Gunstr√∏m and Einar Idland. Their record debut came in 1963 with the single \\"Mette Mette Mette\\". Their first album was called Dizzie Tunes (1967). Their first revue was √Ö, s√• heldig vi er, staged at Chat Noir in 1966 and starring Wenche Myhre. Their next revues were Syv glade lerker p√• en bl√• gren from 1969 and Show f√∏r jo heller from 1971. In 1972 singer and actress Grethe Kausland starred at the revue P√• scenekanten, and she later regularly performed with the group. Other revues were Memories of Music from 1980 and The show must go home from 1984. The 1988 revue Festsprell i Dizzie Tider had Hege Sch√∏yen and Jon Skolmen as guest stars, and Dizzie og Damene at Chat Noir in 1993 had Elisabeth Andreassen and Ellen Nikolaysen as guest performers. In their comedy routines Numme and Gunstr√∏m became an iconic couple playing their characteristic parts, exchanging insults and witty retorts, with Numme attempting to teach and direct the hopelessly inept Gunstr√∏m in various tunes and performances. Gunstr√∏m's comedic talent would often make the audience bowl over laughing. The group won the Spellemannprisen award for 1973 for best children's album, with Den aller siste ra-ta-ta-ta. They reached a large public through their television shows. Their television show Sim Sala Bim from 1973 won the Bronze Rose at the Festival Rose d'Or in Montreux.

The incident, which occurred just after 3:00 p.m. on Sunday, May 21, 1944, began following an explosion in a staging area for Landing Ships, Tank (LSTs) and other amphibious assault ships in West Loch. A fire quickly spread among the ships being prepared for Operation Forager, the invasion of the Japanese-held Mariana Islands. Over the next 24 hours, six LSTs sank, 163 naval personnel died, and 396 were injured. A subsequent Naval Board of Inquiry never determined the exact cause of the disaster but concluded that the initial explosion was caused when a mortar round aboard detonated during an unloading operation because it was either dropped or went off when gasoline vapors ignited. The incident ‚Äì together with the Port Chicago disaster two months later ‚Äì led to major changes in weapons- handling practices within the United States Navy. The LST wreckage was quickly cleared in a salvage operation and dumped at sea south of Hawaii. Only the hull of the partially beached was left in West Loch. A press blackout was enforced and naval personnel were ordered not to talk about the incident. The disaster was classified until 1960 and is therefore not well known. The disaster has been the focus of considerable speculation that during the salvage and removal of the wrecks from West Loch, the U.S. Navy might have found the remains of a Japanese midget submarine, possibly the fifth Japanese midget submarine used in the attack in December 1941. Background Pearl Harbor naval base. The West Loch is the arm of Pearl Harbor on the left side of the image. In May 1944, the West Loch area of Pearl Harbor was unusually crowded with various vessels as it was being used as a staging area for the upcoming Operation Forager. Twenty-nine Landing Ships, Tank (LSTs) were tied up, beam to beam, at six Tare piers. Many of the LSTs, in addition to carrying their own complement of munitions and fuel, were also fully loaded with the munitions, fuel, vehicles, equipment, and other general stores required by the 2nd and 4th Marine Divisions for the invasion of the Marianas, that was to begin in mid-June. To aid quick deployment once ashore, high-octane gasoline was stored in barrels on deck. In the weeks leading up to the incident, the vessels and crews had all been training for the upcoming invasion. The LSTs were each crewed by around 120 Navy sailors or Coast Guardsmen, and manned by around 200 Marine loaders, drivers and mechanics. The rapid expansion of the fleet meant many of the crews were made up of inexperienced sailors and Marines. On 21 May, many of the LSTs had only half their crew aboard because, after a week of intensive training, most officers and ratings had been given shore leave. Explosion The burned hulk of LST-39 on 21 May 1944. on 22 May 1944. LST-480 burns again on 23 May 1944. The sunken where the disaster originated lies off her starboard bow At 15:08, , moored at Tare 8, exploded, sending a large fireball into the sky. The noise was heard miles away at Pearl Harbor Headquarters. More explosions of increasing intensity followed, sparking fears of a Japanese attack or even an earthquake. Fire and debris raining down on the fuel and munitions stored on the decks of other LSTs had caused an explosive chain reaction. Within minutes, 200 men had been blown into the water. Eleven wooden buildings on the shore were destroyed and vehicles blown on their side. In all, 20 buildings were damaged. Initial efforts by the crews to fight the fires were impeded by the heat, although some ships further away managed to muster damage control parties. Many of the LSTs tied together at Tare 8 began to sink. Within the hour, Admiral Richmond K. Turner was directing fire-fighting efforts from a launch. Various LSTs managed to move to safety under their own power or with assistance by tugboats. However others were abandoned and allowed to drift, spreading fires, before sinking in the channel. Leaking oil ignited on the water also spread fires to Tares 7 and 9 even though they had been unharmed after the first explosions at Tare 8. Eventually tugboats and foam-carrying salvage ships from Pearl Harbor arrived to fight the spreading fires. One ship managed to turn a drifting LST away from a collision course with an ammunition ship docked across the loch at the ammunition depot. A final explosion occurred at 22:30; while several LSTs continued to burn for 24 hours. In total, the harbor tugs , , and , the net tender , the chartered tug Mikioi, and smaller tugs YTL-233, YTL-306, YTL-307, YTL-308, YTL-309, and YTL-339 were damaged while engaged in fire control efforts. Casualties The initial official account listed 27 dead and 100 missing. The majority of sources state the final death toll as 163 men, with a further 396 wounded. However, in 2005 the magazine, Sea Classics, claimed the total dead was 392, of which 163 were sailors. The other 229 were Marines from the newly formed 2nd and 4th Marine Divisions, while Army dead were not recorded in the confusion. Pearl Harbor attack survivor and historical researcher, Ray Emory, also disputes the official death toll; he believes 132 men died at West Loch. Investigation A Naval Board of Inquiry, under Rear Admiral John F. Shafroth Jr., was opened in Pearl Harbor the following day. An early theory that the incident was the result of a Japanese submarine attack was dismissed as impractical because of the depth of the West Loch and the presence of anti-submarine nets. The executive officer of LST-353 stated that immediately prior to the explosion, Army stevedores were unloading mortar ammunition from a Landing craft tank (LCT) on the deck of his ship. The procedure to remove the mortar rounds was being undertaken because training had proved M2 mortars could not be fired accurately from LCTs. The enquiry was told the unit given the order to unload the mortar rounds had received no training for the task. Meanwhile, 80 drums of fuel were stacked just from the elevator being used to unload the LCT. Following testimony, the Naval Enquiry Board concluded that a mortar round exploded on LST-353 sparking a chain reaction. However it could not determine the actual cause of the detonation because all those nearest to the explosion were killed. This conclusion was sustained by subsequent reviews. The two most plausible explanations were considered to be: #the accidental dropping of a mortar round being unloaded from the LCT on the LST-353 #the ignition of gasoline vapors from high-octane fuel drums stored on the deck of LST-353. The source being a cigarette (although banned) or welding, which had also been occurring that day aboard LST-353. The enquiry also heard the conduct of the inexperienced crews may have exacerbated the disaster. Lieutenant Commander Joseph B. Hoyt, USNR, the Commander of LST Group 39, Flotilla 13, criticized many of the LST crews for abandoning their vessels too early, leaving them to sink or drift, rather than fire-fighting or attempting to beach them. However he praised the efforts of the crew from LST-274, which received heavy damage but was saved. Several crews and skippers were called to account for inadequate reactions to the emergency, although the severity of the conditions were cited as mitigating factors. In the end no courts-martial or letters of reprimand were issued to anyone involved. The practice of loading fuel and munitions aboard closely moored vessels was deemed to be necessary under the conditions of war and the layout of Pearl Harbor U.S. Navy Base. A recommendation by the Board to avoid nesting in future was criticized by Admiral Chester W. Nimitz as impractical. Reporting The United States military ordered a press blackout following the incident. The official inquiry was marked Top Secret and survivors and eyewitnesses were not permitted to mention the incident in letters home. Four days after the incident, the authorities released a one-paragraph statement noting an explosion had caused \\"some loss of life, a number of injuries and resulted in the destruction of several small vessels\\". It was only after Operation Forager that a fuller account was released to the press. The entire incident was not declassified and made public until 1960. As a result of the secrecy surrounding the incident, it has been asserted that the public knows little about Pearl Harbor's \\"second disaster\\". As of 1997, the only book about the incident, The West Loch Story, was privately published by survivor, William L.C. Johnson. He alleges that a full account had not emerged from the Navy until 1964, and that the incident had been caused by careless smoking. Impact on Operation Forager Six LSTs were sunk (LST-39, LST-43, LST-69, LST-179, LST-353, and LST-480), two already carrying smaller, fully loaded Landing craft tanks (LCT-961, 963 and 983) lashed to their decks. Several LSTs were damaged and/or ran aground. Four (including LST-205 and LST-225) could not be repaired in time for the invasion. Seventeen tracked landing vehicles (LVT) and eight guns were destroyed. Other sources place the total number of destroyed LSTs at nine. With reinforcement of the fleet from elsewhere, and through quick repair efforts, Operation Forager was only delayed by one day as a result of the incident, with the operation commencing essentially as planned three weeks later. Medal of Honor Boatswain's Mate 2nd Class Francis P. Hammerberg, a Navy diver, posthumously received the Medal of Honor for heroism on February 17, 1945, during salvage operations on an LST sunk in the West Loch incident. He was killed in a cave-in while attempting to tunnel under one of the sunken LSTs. He was the only service member in World War II, and the last person of all, to receive the Medal of Honor for a non-combat action. (Prior to World War II, the Navy had frequently awarded the Medal of Honor for non-combat heroism.) Memorials The rusting remains of at . In the weeks following the disaster, all wreckage was salvaged and removed, with the exception of (sometimes reported as LST-353). Its rusting bow was left where it was beached during the disaster. In April 1995, the first memorial to the disaster was unveiled: a table-sized plaque sited on the shore of the loch. At the behest of Congress, gravestones of unidentified victims in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific were amended in the 2000s (decade) from recording simply \\"unknown\\", to \\"Unknown, West Loch Disaster, May 21, 1944\\". The Navy commemorated the 65th anniversary of the disaster on 21 May 2009. Legacy As a result of the incident, and the Port Chicago disaster two months later, the Navy drastically changed its ordnance-handling procedures. It insisted on full training for handlers, munitions to be redesigned for safer handling, and that vessels should no longer be nested together when ammunition was being loaded or handled. It is also possible that the salvage operation undertaken to clear the loch after the disaster inadvertently lengthened the hunt for the \\"fifth midget submarine\\" involved in the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. After three pieces of a midget submarine were discovered three miles south of Pearl Harbor, a working theory was developed that this was the only submarine in a group of five Japanese Ko-hyoteki class submarines involved in the attack that had not yet been accounted for. Researchers posited that it had penetrated the harbor to attack Battleship Row, before escaping into West Loch and being scuttled by the two-man crew. Lying on the bed of the loch, it was then salvaged along with the remains of the LSTs, LCTs and landing tanks, and then dumped at sea.

Early life and career John Henry Raap was born August 1, 1840 in L√ºdingworth, Hanover, Germany to Ernst Raap and Catharina M. (Cords) Raap.Album of genealogy and biography, Cook County, Illinois The Raap family moved to America in 1854, settling in Chicago in a house on Cornell Street near Ashland Avenue. John Henry also had a sister named Minnie Dilcher. He had been confirmed in the German Lutheran Church, and remained an adherent of that faith. He learned to speak English fluently, and after arriving in Chicago he began working in a brick yard while attending a night school to prepare for a business career. Raap's first business venture, in 1859 at the age of 18, was a grocery store at the corner of Pratt Street and Milwaukee Avenue. He opened this business with a capital of only $50, and sold out at a considerable profit at the end of two years.Origin, growth, and usefulness of the Chicago Board of Trade, published 1885 At the outbreak of the Civil War, Raap enlisted in the volunteer service in Company A, under Captain Molotzy, and was sent to Cairo with seventeen other companies; these were the first troops raised in Chicago. At the expiration of seven months from date of enlistment Raap was mustered out of service, in consequence of continued ill health. He ran a general store for two years in the nearby town of Dunkel's Grove (now Addison, Illinois), and then disposed of this business and returned to the city in 1864 where he reopened in a frame building. He engaged in the flour and feed trade in this small building on Milwaukee Avenue, and when he opened his wholesale liquor house, he merged his smaller building into it. In 1870 he built his three- story brick buildings, known as Raap's block, a portion of which he occupied for his rapidly increasing business. Raap gradually extended his trade until he ranked among the most successful German businessmen in Chicago. After the block was completed, Raap successfully embarked in the saloon business, and in 1874 he became an importer and wholesale dealer in foreign and domestic wines and liquors. From 1873 to 1877, Raap was Captain of State Militia. Raap had a physical altercation with his brother-in-law, policeman John H. Dilcher, on the sidewalk in front of his saloon; after beating him, Raap went back into the saloon, leaving Dilcher on the sidewalk. Dilcher went back inside the saloon with other police officers and arrested Raap without a warrant. Raap filed an action against the arresting officers seeking to recover damages for assault and battery and false imprisonment. The trial court held in his favor and the officers sought review with the Supreme Court of Illinois; in 1874, the court determined that the treatment of Raap by the officers corroborated his allegation that they were not acting in their official duty but were assisting Dilcher in an act of revenge, affirming the previous court judgment.Dilcher et al. v. Raap Personal life Raap's first wife was Sophia Sohle. In 1870, Raap owned real estate valued at $30,000, and his personal estate was worth $10,000.1870 United States Census Sophia died September 3, 1871.Graceland Cemetery records Raap purchased a plot in Graceland Cemetery in 1872 and had the remains of his father and Sophia transferred there from Wunders Cemetery, and had his mother buried there when she died in 1878. Raap married his second wife, Helena Hannah Gilow of Grim, Prussia, on May 1, 1873. They had five children: John Henry, junior (also known as \\"Hank\\", b. May 1874),John Henry Raap Jr.'s tombstone, Graceland Cemetery. Tillie L. (b. May 18761900 United States Census, Chicago enumeration district 427, page 11, lines 63-68), Robert R. (b. June 1879), Ernst E. (b. June 1884Illinois, Cook County Birth Registers, 1871-1915), and Pearl Frances (b. April 1893). The Raaps had three more children, a set of twins in 1878 and another child in 1882, who died as infants. In 1879, Raap had a three-story Second Empire mansion built in what was later known as Chicago's Wicker Park neighborhood; the mansion is now considered a landmark, and is one of the largest mansions in Wicker Park.Chicago's Mansions by John Graf Raap was connected with many social orders and societies, including the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, the Sons of Hermann, the Central Turner Society, the Teutonia Maennerchor, and the Chicago Rebekah Society. He was a Republican with much influence in political affairs, although he never held any office. Death G. H. Braunschweig, the collector and agent of Raap's company, had been indicted for embezzlement by a grand jury in March 1897. Raap wanted to bring up charges of embezzlement and forgery against his employee, who had threatened to kill himself if Raap pressed the charge against him. Raap claimed the defalcation was in the amount of $2,300, while Braunschweig claimed it was only $1,500 and that Raap owed him $400 salary.\\"Kills Accuser and Self\\" - Chicago Tribune, Saturday April 24, 1897 At 5:45 on the morning of April 23, 1897, the date the case was to have been heard in court, Braunschweig began travelling back and forth between Raap's residence, the residence of Raap's attorney (Joseph O'Donnell, who had been prosecuting the case in court), and the wholesale liquor house on Milwaukee avenue, trying to arrange a meeting at Raap's office to avoid arrest and appearance in court. Braunschweig wanted to make a settlement, offering seven lots in Park Ridge valued at $1,000 and two lots in Kensington valued at $1,000; Raap refused to take these and insisted on having the cash, but was willing to take Braunschweig's home instead, which he was unwilling to give up. When Braunschweig arrived at Raap's home, he told the man's sons Robert (a driver for the liquor firm) and Henry (a member of the concern) that he was anxious to meet their father at his office; Raap believed that Braunschweig did not have the money, and instructed his sons to drive to the home of Deputy Sheriff Phillip Salomon and tell him to serve Braunschweig with a capias. Meanwhile, Braunschweig went to the home of O'Donnell and told him that a conference had been arranged with Raap at his office at 8 o'clock, and that he was wanted to close up the affair; as O'Donnell had no message from Raap, he declined to go. When Braunschweig reached the liquor house office at 8 o'clock, Robert and Henry Raap and the company's rectifier Carl Pinnow were working inside, while J.H. Raap was busy in a rear room. Braunschweig requested Robert Raap to go to O'Donnell's office once more, but when he came back he had a reply from O'Donnell stating that if Braunschweig wanted to settle he could do so in court. At 8:45 o'clock, Deputy Salomon read the capias to Braunschweig, who asked for a moment to talk privately with his accuser, Raap, before he was placed under arrest. Braunschweig entered Raap's office, and as Raap crossed the threshold to his office, Braunschweig shot him in the head with a revolver. Raap fell over dead, and Braunschweig then fatally shot himself as well. The homicide was ruled an intentional murder.Chicago Homicide archives, case 2035 Raap was buried in his family plot in Graceland Cemetery. John and Robert continued their father's business after his death.

Her keel was laid 15 August 1942, launched 28 November 1942 and commissioned on 30 August 1943. She was built as a WAGL and redesignated a WLB in 1965. Ship's history In the spring of 1943 Tupelo serviced aids to navigation (ATON), did search and recovery work near Norfolk, Virginia and broke ice in Chesapeake Bay. Tupelo was refitted as a Navy Damage Control Ship at the United States Coast Guard Yard Baltimore, Maryland in 1943. En route to fight in the Pacific War, via the Panama Canal, Tupelo went to the aid of the seagoing tugboat MV Atengo, which was in peril off the western coast of Mexico in a hurricane. During the rescue a crewman of Atengo had his hand mangled in an accident. Tupelo's surgeon treated the man and had to amputate his thumb. Tupelo was at Kwajalein Atoll next, en route to Guam with a convoy of Landing Craft Infantry (LCIs) . In 1944 she took tow of USS Oregon (BB-3) from a U.S. Navy seagoing tug, the Oregon was then a hulk to be used as a dynamite barge in Guam. Tupelo towed Oregon 100 miles to Guam. Upon arrival in Guam, which was still held by the Japanese Tupelo received her baptism under fire, while the U.S. fleet shelled the island. Tupelo's crew blasted a channel in the reef on the south side of Guam to accept Oregon's draft. Oregon was loaded with 1500 tons of 40 percent gelatin dynamite. From 1944 to 1946 Tupelo was assigned to Service Squadron 4, the \\"Harbor Stretchers\\", U.S. Pacific Fleet, and served there establishing and maintaining over 50 massive moorings for U.S. Navy ships with 15 ton anchors and 2-1/2 inch chain. She was also used to set buoys around minefields and to transport tons of dynamite to U.S. forces throughout the Pacific Islands. Tupelo was also responsible for maintaining Aids to Navigation (ATON) at Guam. Following the war, on 1 July 1946 Tupelo was reassigned to Toledo, Ohio for maintaining Aids to Navigation, search and rescue, law enforcement and ice breaking on Lake Erie. On 25 June 1950 she patrolled the Mills Trophy Race off Kelleys Island, Ohio. On 27 November 1950 she assisted the tug MV Whitney and two scows 1.5 miles off of Toledo, Ohio. From 9 through 11 January 1951 she escorted the disabled tugboat MV Sherman H. Serre from Erie, Pennsylvania to Cleveland, Ohio. On 24 June 1951 she once again patrolled the Mills Trophy Race at Kelleys Island, Ohio. On 20 October 1951 she assisted MV George F. Rand off of Port Huron, Michigan. During 13‚Äì14 December 1951 she searched for but did not find a missing Cessna aircraft in western Lake Erie. On 11 September 1952 she assisted grounded MV Kulas and MV Fink in the Livingstone Channel. From 23 to 25 September 1952 Tupelo searched for but did not find an overdue pleasure craft (PC) in western Lake Erie. On 21 April 1953 she assisted the grounded MV J.H. Hillman in the St. Clair River. During 23 through 25 August 1953 she ran a safety patrol for the Rochester Race in Lake Ontario. On 24 January 1955 she assisted an icebound tug and barges near Detroit. On 13 June 1955 Tupelo searched for a missing pleasure craft in western Lake Erie. On 20 April 1956 she assisted following collision between MV A.M. Byers and MV E.M. Ford off Sans Souci. On 14 July 1957 Tupelo patrolled the International Race near St Clair, Michigan. On 12 November 1957 she assisted a grounded vessel in Amherstburg Channel. On 1 March 1958 she helped restore power to Marblehead, Ohio. From 4 to 5 October 1958 Tupelo patrolled the Cleveland Race. During 25 through 26 Jul 1959 she patrolled Mackinac Island Race. In 1961 Tupelo salvaged PCJ-3776. On 1 August 1962 she assisted MV Montense after it wrecked in the Detroit River. On 12 January 1963 she assisted in the rescue of 154 persons stranded on an ice floe adrift 10 miles east of Toledo, on 25 January 1965 she escorted the damaged USCGC Bramble (WLB-392) to Toledo, Ohio for repair, in mid-September 1965 Tupelo salvaged a downed U.S. Navy helicopter from Lake Erie. On 31 January 1969 an ice jam blocked the flow of the river below Monroe, Michigan, causing the river to back up and flood the city, Tupelo broke up the ice jam, restoring the river‚Äôs flow into the lake thus saving the city from extensive damage. During the Lake Erie station era Tupelo participated in Operation Coal Shovel. In the spring of 1969 Tupelo was reassigned to Astoria, Oregon relieving USCGC Magnolia (WLB-328) Her duties there were maintaining Aids to Navigation (ATON), search and rescue operations, ice breaking and law and fishing treaty enforcement. Tupelo also tended the lightship USCGC Columbia (WLV-604) while Columbia was on station at the Columbia River Bar. From 9 through 11 October 1969 Tupelo stood by grounded British MV Hawthorne Enterprise on Mona Island until relieved by the USCGC Point Warde (WPB-82368). On 30 September 1975 the Tupelo was decommissioned at a ceremony in Astoria, Oregon. In September 1977 Tupelo was sold to private enterprise. She underwent extensive rework to her superstructure and had a new power plant installed for her new Seattle owners, Baranof Fisheries. She was renamed FV Courageous and has been fishing the Bering Sea for crab and longlining for cod for the last thirty years. Her catches are also processed on board. In October 2008 in rough seas, the FV Courageous was instrumental in assisting the U.S. Coast Guard on the FV Katmai search and rescue operation; and by recovering bodies from the sunken vessel.

Geography Despite the Pine Hills reaching over 3,300 feet (1,000 meters) in elevation, the surrounding flat terrain ranges from between 2,300-2,500 feet (700‚Äì800 meters), making the range's prominence only 800‚Äì1,000 feet (250‚Äì300 meters.) There are also several ranges of buttes in nearby areas, and some of these are of higher elevation than the Pine Hills, however these are not associated with the range. Ecology The Pine Hills are mostly covered with lush sage and stands of Rocky Mountain ponderosa pine woodland. Many of these are relict stands from wetter times. The climate in this range is similar to the rest of Eastern Montana, hot, wet summers and cold, dry winters.

The squarish loop known as Lillinonah Trail extends from its eastern terminus at the junction of Hanover Road and Pond Brook Road in Newtown along the eastern bank of the Housatonic River inlet known as Pond brook until it turns north-east at Lake Lillinonah. The Lillinonah Trail is primarily used for hiking, backpacking, picnicking, and in the winter, snowshoeing. Portions of the trail are suitable for, and are used for, cross-country skiing. Site-specific activities enjoyed along the route include hunting (very limited), fishing, horseback riding, bouldering and rock climbing (limited). There are signs at the trail heads forbidding mountain biking but they are periodically ignored. Trail route Newton Forest Association Sign marking Al's Trail on the Lillinonah Trail The western section of the Lillinonah Trail parallels Pond Brook on high eastern bank running south to north. The northern Lillinonah trail section follows the Housatonic River/Lake Lillinonah from west to east but turns inland to the southeast before the junction of the Housatonic River with the Shepaug River. Inland the trail traverses a hill to a high point of 480 feet and descends south-east until it reaches the western bank of the Housatonic River/Lake Lillinonah. The eastern section of the trail follows the western bank of the Housatonic River/Lake Lillinonah until just before a point on the shore to which is anchored a line of buoys to the Shepaug Dam at the southern end of Lake Lillinonah. The southern section of the Lillinonah Trail begins at the Paugussett State Forest parking lot at the end of Echo Valley Road. After skirting a private property lot it generally travel north and west along the Paugussett State Forest upper block boundary. The Lillinonah Trail traverses several high river bank ridges with scenic views of the Housatonic River though they may be obscured by foliage, particularly in the summer. This 3.2 mile section of the trail near the river banks is designated a 'scenic trail' by the Connecticut Department of Environment Protection (and who close it from December 15 to March 15). Several year-round and seasonal streams cut across the trail to flow into the Housatonic River. The Lillinonah Trail travels near several \\"milepost\\" markers labeled with the letters \\"CL&P;\\" (Connecticut Light and Power). A few miles south of Lillinonah Trail on the Housatonic River can be found the Lake Zoar Blue-Blazed Trails which span both the west and east banks of Lake Zoar. The Zoar Trail is on the western bank of Lake Zoar in the lower block of the Paugussett State Forest in Newtown. The Kettletown State Park trails are on the eastern bank of Lake Zoar, primarily in Kettletown State Park (in Southbury. 'Al's Trail' overlaps with the Lillinonah Trail for the first four miles of each. The two separate shortly before the Lillinonah Trail reaches the Paugussett State Forest parking lot at the end of Echo Valley Road. Al's Trail continues for six more miles through Newtown, Connecticut, ending near the grounds of the former state mental institution known as \\"Fairfield Hills\\" (AKA Fairfield State Hospital). Newtown currently (2010) has a proposal to turn these former grounds into a town recreational with multi-use trails. There are marked and unmarked trails and dirt forest roads which cross the interior of the Paugussett State Forest Upper Block, some of which connect to the Lillinonah Trail. The Polly Brody Fire Road is a wide dirt road which arcs from the end of Echo Valley Road through the center of the state forest block. A shared-use trail (mountain biking, horseback, & hiking) known as the Upper Gussy Trail has been built by members of the CT Chapter of the New England Mountain Bike Association and Newtown Bridle Lands Association. The Upper Gussy Trail is a State of Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection officially approved shared-use trail. The State DEP now has an official Upper Paugussett Trails Map with all the recognized trails in the forest. There are connectors between these trails (including the White Trail).

History and folklore South Lake Lillinonah facing the Shepaug Dam The Lillinonah Blue-Blazed Trail was created in the early 1940s by the Connecticut Forest and Park Association. The route of the original and planned (longer) Lillinonah trail blazed can be seen in the Connecticut Forest and Park Association 1940 Connecticut Walk Book map of major trails. In 1872 the Shepaug, Litchfield and Northern Railroad (also known as the \\"Great Northern\\") from Bethel, Connecticut (by way of Hawleyville) ran track along Pond Brook to a Housatonic River bridge north to the Shepaug Valley (from which it wended a path to Litchfield, Connecticut). The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (AKA \\"The New Haven\\") leased the 32 mile long Shepaug line from 1892 to 1947. A twice-daily passenger service was discontinued in the 1930s and the line was completely shut down in 1948 at the request of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad.http://www.hvceo.org/transport/railhistory.php#ABANDONED Origin and name Lake Lillinonah is named for the legend of a tragic romance between a Native American (of the Pootatuck / Paugussett tribe) maiden and a European (white) colonist.http://www.ct.gov/dep/cwp/view.asp?A=2716&Q;=325226 The Pootatuck (often spelled Pohtatuck in colonial era documents and related to the name Potatuck) were a branch of the Paugussett tribe who lived along the Housatonic and Pootatuck Rivers near the Sandy Hook area of Newtown, Connecticut (an area which was called \\"Pohtatuck\\" before the name was changed to \\"Sandy Hook\\"). It is unknown if a permanent Native American settlement existed at or near the upper block of Paugussett State Forest. Newtown, known as Quanneapague, was purchased from the Pohtatuck in 1705 and incorporated as a town in 1711. Most of the original settlers were farmers from Stratford and Milford, Connecticut. Paugussett is the name of an Algonquian- speakingTrumbull, http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/tribes/delaware/wappingerhist.htm native American tribe and sachemdom existing in southwestern Connecticut in the 17th century. Derby Connecticut was once known as \\"Paugussett\\" before it was renamed in 1675. Paugussett villages existed in Bridgeport, Trumbull, Stratford, Shelton, Monroe and Oxford in Fairfield County as well as in what is now Milford, Orange, Woodbridge, Beacon Falls, Derby and Naugatuck in New Haven County, Connecticut. Pootatuck (AKA Potatuck) was a village of the Paugussett where the Pootatuck River is today in Newtown. Legend of Lillanonah CONNECTICUT HISTORY Caves Steep Rock Chief Two Moons  LEGENDS  Lillinonah's Leap Leatherman Molly Fisher Pinnacle LILLINONAH'S LEAP  When the English colonies in New England were very young, there was hardly an Indian between the Hudson and the Penobscot Rivers who did not know about Chief Waramaug, the great sachem of the Pootatuck tribe of western Connecticut. This is a legend about his daughter, Lillinonah. Not only was Chief Waramug respected far and wide for his courage, wisdom and charismatic leadership, but he was also admired for his magnificent hilltop headquarters overlooking the Housatonic River, not far above the present town of New Milford. Called \\"Waramaug's Palace,\\" the structure was said to have been at least twenty feet wide and a hundred feet long, a \\"long house,\\" indeed, and unquestionably the largest Indian building ever constructed in New England. Made from bark and logs which had to be carried for many miles (mostly up hill) on the backs of the artisans who built it, Waramaug's Palace was famed both for its architectural grandeur and its ornate interior decoration. It is said, for example, that the walls of the cavernous main council chamber were covered with colorful paintings of the chief, members of his family, his councilors and judges, while smaller apartments were adorned from floor to ceiling with pictures of all the beasts, birds, reptiles and insects to be found in the land of the Pootatucks. As proud as Waramaug was of his imposing palace, he was even prouder of the light of his life, his lovely daughter, Lillinonah. Taught from birth to cultivate those virtues most revered by her father -- compassion for one's fellow man, loyalty to family and tribe and sensitivity to the beauties of Nature -- Lillinonah was, at the age of eighteen, a young woman whose humanity matched her grace and beauty. From near and far the young braves came, as moths to the flame, to pay homage to Lillinonah -- and perhaps win her hand in marriage. But first, of course, each had to pass muster with old Waramaug, and that was no simple matter. Now it happened that on a cold and wintry day, as Lillinonah was out walking in the woods high above the swift rapids of the Housatonic, she came upon a handsome young white man wandering aimlessly through the forest, stumbling occasionally and falling to his knees before rising once more and continuing on. It was obvious to the Indian maiden that the man was sick with cold and fever, weak of body and confused of mind. With pity in her heart for the suffering stranger, she offered to assist him back to the village of the Pootatucks, where he might find rest and treatment for his illness. When the white man nodded his assent, she slowly walked him to her home, though he had to lean heavily upon her for support, lest he collapse in the effort. Although the elders of the village did not approve and did nothing to help her, Lillinonah nursed the stricken Englishman through all the rest of the long, cold winter, seldom leaving his side. As spring came to the encampment of the Pootatucks, he was well along the road to recovery, thanks to the care of his attentive nurse and the good medicine which she had provided. With the blossoming of the mountain laurel on the banks of the Housatonic, love, too, bloomed in the house of Lillinonah. As the beautiful daughter of Waramaug gazed with undisguised affection into the eyes of the man whose life she had saved, she saw that he returned her adoration with unaffected ardor. When summer came, the two young lovers finally decided that they must go to Chief Waramaug, for a love as deep as theirs must be consummated by marriage. The great sachem's reaction, however, was as they both expected: he was very angry. With all the eligible Indian suitors for miles around still beating a path to her door, how dare Lillinonah ask for his blessing on a union with a white man, an unknown stranger whose culture was so different from her own? Was it not true that the paleface despised the Indians, regarding them as little better than the savage beasts of the forest? No, said Waramaug, never would he sanction Lillinonah's marriage to such a man. But Lillinonah refused to eat or drink. Her once lovely face turned sallow and she began to shrink before the very eyes of her distraught father. As summer waned, the once beautiful daughter of Waramaug became a pale shadow of her former self, so great was her pain and powerful her will. Finally, although he still regarded marriage between his daughter and a white man as a burden almost too heavy to bear, Waramaug relented. Reluctantly, he consented to the marriage of his beloved Lillinonah to the man she had found lost in the woods on that long ago winter's day. Before the marriage could take place, the betrothed couple agreed, the fair young man should return to his own people, to let them know that he was still alive and well, and to tell them of his plans to wed Lillinonah and live for the rest of his life in the company of the Pootatucks. Both lovers realized that his people would urge him not to go back to his lovely Indian princess. They would remind him that there were plenty of young English women in the colonies just looking for a husband as attractive as he was. What right had he to wed a dusky maid from a foreign and inferior race? But he promised Lillinonah that no argument would ever persuade him to break their vow to marry. After one final winter with his own people, he would return to Lillinonah -- in the early spring. Sadly, he took his leave. The autumn passed, and winter, too, and as the first green began to show in the hickory and oak along the Housatonic, Lillinonah bedecked herself with the wild flowers of the forest as she waited in happy anticipation for her lover's return. But summer came and went, the reds and yellows of autumn showed bright on the trees, and still the young Englishman had not come back to the land of the Pootatucks. Lillinonah no longer sang a joyous song. There were no more flowers in her hair. Wan and listless, she wandered through the woods, her eyes red-rimmed from weeping, searching and hoping against hope that she had not been forgotten. Chief Waramaug watched sadly as once more his daughter's health began to fail and her usually happy disposition to turn morose under mounting waves of despondency. Perhaps, he thought, he might bring her back from the brink of deep depression if he could only interest her in a young man of her own race. So, unknown to Lillinonah, Waramaug arranged a marriage for her with Eagle Feather, one of the brightest, most promising braves in the Pootatuck tribe. Surely, such a fine youth as he, could give Lillinonah something to live for. But word reached Lillinonah of her father's arrangement with Eagle Feather -- and she reacted immediately. Down on the shore of the Housatonic River, now rapid and swollen with the heavy rains of autumn, she climbed into a canoe and shoved off into the teeth of the roaring current. As the canoe was carried faster and faster toward the turbulent waters above the dangerous falls of the river, Lillinonah tossed away her paddle and sank back in the bottom of the canoe to await her fate. Then, high on a crag jutting over the river just above the cataract, she saw him! Her lost lover had not forgotten. Even above the roar of the water she heard him call her name. She stood in the canoe, waved her arms and screamed for help. Though he knew his chances of saving his beloved were slim at best, the young Englishman did not hesitate for a moment. He leaped from the overhanging bluff and plunged into the whitened water, just as Lillinonah's canoe struck a rock in the middle of the river and capsized, spilling her into the frothy current. Swiftly as he could, he swam to her side and clasped her body to him. Alas, neither realized that it was already too late. Still wrapped in loving embrace, the doomed pair disappeared into the boiling falls and were crushed to death as they were hurled to the rocks in the broad pool below. They say that when the battered bodies of the star-crossed lovers were finally found, they were still locked in each other's arms. Noble, even in deepest mourning for his lost Lillinonah, Chief Waramaug ordered that his daughter and her white lover be buried side by side, contrary to Indian tradition, on the top of a hill overlooking the narrow gap of the Housatonic River now known as Lover's Leap. And when old Waramaug finally joined his ancestors many sad years later, legend says that he, too, was laid to rest near the ill-fated couple. Though the tragic life of Lillinonah ended centuries ago, her legend will never be forgotten. Any Connecticut map will show that the wide portion of the Housatonic River which stretches for miles below the narrow rapids where the lovers met their deaths is, to this day, still called Lake Lillinonah. \\\\----from Legendary Connecticut by David E.

Historic sites Lake Lillinonah was created in 1955 by damming the Housatonic River via the construction of the Shepaug Dam (another \\"Shepaug Reservoir Dam\\" stands upstream on the Shepaug River and is owned by the City of Waterbury, Connecticut) to produce hydro-electric power. The reservoir was prematurely and accidentally flooded by Hurricane Diane on August 19, 1955 a few weeks before the dam was scheduled to commence operation. The lake was drained and refilled again beginning on September 27, 1955 by closing the gates on the new dam.http://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Lake-Lillinonah- has-colorful-history-55777.php In 1985 Shepaug Dam owners opened a free public observation site in Southbury, Connecticut near the hydroelectric generation plant for viewing Lake Lillinonah's Bald Eagles (and other predatory bird species such as hawks).

The mainline Lillinonah trail is blazed with blue rectangles. It is regularly maintained, and is considered easy hiking, with very few sections of rugged and moderately difficult hiking (notably just the climb up to the northern high point near the great Oak tree). Much of the Lillinonah Trail is close to water and though some swamp areas inland are prone to flooding the trail along the lake shore is mostly on very high ground. There are no camping facilities along the trail and camping is prohibited in the Paugussett State Forest Upper Block. Trail descriptions are available from a number of commercial and non-commercial sources, and a complete guidebook is published by the Connecticut Forest and Park Association Weather along the route is typical of Connecticut. Conditions on exposed ridge tops and summits may be harsher during cold or stormy weather.NOAA Lightning is a hazard on exposed summits and ledges during thunderstorms. Snow is common in the winter and may necessitate the use of snowshoes. Ice can form on exposed ledges and summits, making hiking dangerous without special equipment. Metacomet Trail Extensive flooding in ponds, puddles and streams may occur in the late winter or early spring, overflowing into the trail and causing very muddy conditions. In this case fairly high waterproof boots are recommended. Some parts of the trail follow forest roads which often contain ruts from ATVs and four-wheel drive vehicles. Biting insects can be bothersome during warm weather. Parasitic deer ticks (which are known to carry Lyme disease) are a potential hazard. Only the trail heads are close to (rural) civilization (and paved roads). There is only one very short dirt road walk‚Äîalong Echo Valley Road. Almost all of the trail is adjacent to, or is on lands where hunting and the use of firearms are permitted. Wearing bright orange clothing during the hunting season (Fall through December) is recommended. Note that much of the trail is closed from December 15 to March 15 for the protection of Eagles during their nesting season.

(1492 or 1497 ‚Äì c. 1540), was a Spanish Franciscan friar and author of some of the most influential works on spirituality in Spain in the 16th century. His book The Third Spiritual Alphabet influenced Saint Teresa of Jesus.Teresa of Avila, Life It is considered a masterpiece of Franciscan mysticism. His premise in the book is that friendship and communion with God are possible in this life through cleansing one's conscience, entering one's heart, resting in loving stillness, and then rising above the heart to God alone. Life=Early life Francis was born in the village of Osuna, in the province of Seville, in either 1492 or 1497 (he himself was unsure), of poor peasants whose names are not recorded. In his writings, he described his ancestors as having long been in the service of the Counts of Ure√±a. Francis himself entered military service while in his teens, in the course of which he saw action at the conquest of Tripoli (25 August 1510) by Spain under Pedro Navarro, Count of Oliveto.Francisco de Osuna, The Third Spiritual Alphabet, trans Mary E Giles, (New York: Paulist Press; London: SPCK, 1981), p3. This is known from Osuna‚Äôs own reference to it in a sermon he preached, published in 1533. After his return to Spain from the campaign, Francisco chose to embark on a career in the Church. To this end he enrolled at the University of Seville, where he studied Latin and rhetoric. Shortly after this, he set out with a friend on a pilgrimage to the great shrine of St. James the Greater at Santiago de Compostella.Francisco de Osuna, The Third Spiritual Alphabet, trans Mary E Giles, (New York: Paulist Press; London: SPCK, 1981), p6. This is referred to in Osuna‚Äôs Fifth Spiritual Alphabet. In the course of this journey, according to his own account, he apparently had a religious experience. He completed his studies in 1513, whereupon he received the habit of the Observant branch of the Order of Friars Minor, with the Province of Castile. This was a reform movement in the Order then becoming widespread in Spain, which sought to re-establish the primacy of prayer and poor living as practiced by their holy founder, St. Francis of Assisi. Friar Francisco made his profession of religious vows in 1514, under the reformist leader, Francisco de Qui√±ones, Vicar of the province and later Minister General of the whole Order. He then resumed his studies, first at the province's House of Philosophy in Torrelaguna (1514-1518), followed by theological studies at the Complutense University, then still in Alcal√° (1518-1522). There he mastered the three schools of theology being taught in his day, viz., Scotism, Scholasticism and the Nominalism of Gabriel Biel. In 1523, Osuna entered the Salceda retreat house, situated near Guadalajara, one of eight retreat houses in the province of Castile. It was an isolated house, large enough to accommodate up to 24 religious, and with five hermitages in the surrounding hills, so that one could spend up to a week in perfect seclusion.Francisco de Osuna, The Third Spiritual Alphabet, trans Mary E Giles, (New York: Paulist Press; London: SPCK, 1981), p6 Osuna‚Äôs life there was strictly regulated and dedicated to prayer and meditation. As part of this, he practiced recollection. In order to develop his inner prayer life, he formulated maxims as a guide for meditation, which he arranged alphabetically.

The popularity of the work is shown by the fact it enjoyed several editions in the following decades (1527, 1537, 1544, 1554, 1555, 1638, 1911).Francisco de Osuna, The Third Spiritual Alphabet, trans Mary E Giles, (New York: Paulist Press; London: SPCK, 1981), p8.

Childhood  David Shilling was born in London and attended St Paul's School, London.http://www.answers.com/topic/david- shillinghttp://www.davidshilling.com/development.html He began to design hats and outfits at the age of twelve for his mother, Gertrude, until she died in 1999.http://www.answers.com/topic/david-shilling The hats were designed for Gertrude to wear to the Ascot horse races. At the age of thirteen he began selling toys to his local toyshop, before moving on to sell clothing accessories such as scarves to major retailers (for example Fenwick, Fortnum & Mason, and Liberty). He left St Paul's with the aim of pursuing design. Early trading Shilling opened his first store in Marylebone High Street in 1976: two days after its opening the store received an order from a rock star's wife for twenty four hats.http://www.davidshilling.com/development.html His first collection was purchased in America by Bloomingdale's; and other stores began selling his creations soon afterwards. In the late 1970s Bergdorf Goodman charged up to $3000 for David Shilling hats. Later activities Shilling subsequently decided to stop the wholesale branch of his hat-making works and focus entirely on made-to-order products. In 2007 he displayed the first of an expected ten collections of hats (each priced at ¬£1,000,000) at Top Marques Monaco. In November 2009 he held his first show in mainland China at the Ritz-Carlton in Beijing.  Notable events  In 1988, the USSR invited Shilling to show his hats during the first Miss USSR Pageant in Moscow, the first live TV broadcast throughout the USSR, which was allegedly viewed by 200 million. In 1990 he headed a mission for the United Nations in Ecuador which was hugely successful and led to other projects as an art and design ambassador with the UN in Africa and Asia. In 1994 Shilling was invited to design the emblem for Britain's Festival of Arts and Culture; due to this he became a driving force behind the new \\"Cool Britannia\\" rebranding of Britain. In 1998 his designs for theatre, opera, ballet, film and TV formed an exhibition at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre.http://www.davidshilling.com/uptonow.html A hat with diamonds created by David in the late 1970s was nominated by the Guinness Book of World Records as the most expensive hat in the world in the 21st century. In 2012 David Shilling held a preview of a collection of hats designed for men at the Embassy of Monaco, London.  Work on show  Shilling is now a respected fine artist, and is represented by the Redfern Gallery in Cork Street, London and Ferrero Gallery, Nice. His works may also be seen at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York), the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Los Angeles County Museum, the Louvre (Paris) and the Victoria and Albert Museum (London).

In 1877, Noble lost his ranch to creditors, and it was bought at auction by Frank and Sarah Clough. James Singleton appropriated all of the water in San Timoteo Creek, an act that initiated an 1880s lawsuit by ranch owners below the property and resulted in a ruling that allowed alternating use of the water by Singleton and other ranchers on a five-day cycle. The lawsuit was not settled until 1884, three years after the death of James Singleton. In 1911, half-brothers William H. Singleton and James Haskell bought the Clough ranch, and the former rancho was reunited as the Singleton/Haskell Ranch.

The Security Council expressed regret that the Bosnian Serbs had not complied with the aforementioned resolutions. There were reports of human rights violations and mass murder, illegal detention, forced labour, rape and deportation at Srebrenica, Banja Luka and Sanski Most. There were further reports, by the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation and humanitarian agencies, of violations in the sectors West, North and South of Croatia, including the burning of houses, looting and murder. The Council also condemned the Bosnian Serbs for not allowing the International Committee of the Red Cross to have access to displaced persons and prisoners. All violations of international humanitarian law and human rights in the former Yugoslavia were condemned and all parties were required to respect their obligations. The Bosnian Serbs also had to permit access to displaced persons, prisoners and missing persons, respect their rights, their safety and ensure their immediate release. In addition to this, the resolution demanded that all detention camps in Bosnia and Herzegovina be closed. Meanwhile, the Croatian government had to ensure that violations of humanitarian law and human rights cease and those guilty for any violations were to be punished. The rights of its Serb population had to be respected, including repatriation of refugees, and not to place any time limits on the return of refugees to claim their property. All countries, particularly in the territory of former Yugoslavia, had to co-operate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia established in Resolution 827 (1993) and respond requests from the trial chamber. The parties, especially the Bosnian Serbs, were instructed not to destroy, alter, conceal or damage evidence of violations of international humanitarian law.

Corporate history=California Central Federal Credit Union In 1969, the leaders of California's credit union movement collectively recognized the need for a non-competitive service provider. From this common vision, the California Central Federal Credit Union was chartered. The nation's first federally chartered central credit union, California Central FCU was originally created to serve the liquidity needs of credit unions and credit union organizations in California. In 1975, CCFCU expanded its field of membership to include all credit unions and credit union associations in National Credit Union Administration Region VI, becoming the nation's first regional corporate. Western Corporate Federal Credit Union In 1976 the credit union changed its name to Western Corporate Federal Credit Union (WesCorp) to reflect a desire to serve organizational needs within the parameters of a regional charter. Natural person members, although allowed in the original charter, were discontinued as the corporate focused exclusively on institutional business.

Rundle (December 14, 1842 ‚Äì July 11, 1924) was a Union Army soldier in the American Civil War and a recipient of the United States military's highest decoration, the Medal of Honor, for his actions during the Siege of Vicksburg. He was born in Kentucky and fought on the side of the Union during the American Civil War. While fighting in Vicksburg he, along with 149 others charged the Confederate fortification called the Stockade Redan, which guarded the Graveyard Road approach to the city. These men were to fill in the ditch in front of the work and carried only debris, planks, and ladders as they charged. Those that reached the ditch took refuge in it at the base of the redan, only to be pinned down by intense Confederate fire. They continued to resist Confederate attacks until nightfall and Rundle and a few others managed to escape. After the war he became a farmer in Colorado and started a family. While living in Grand Junction he was arrested he resisted a city marshal attempts to capture his dog, but was found not guilty of interfering with a city marshal. He sold his farm in 1902 and worked in the Grand Junction Post Office until retiring in 1919. After retiring they moved to southern California attempting to improve his wife's health. He and his wife, Hettie, lived in an old soldiers' home until they died and were buried side by side at the Los Angeles National Cemetery. Early life and military service Rundle was born in Kentucky on December 14, 1842. He joined the Army from Oakley Township, Illinois in August 1862, and by May 22, 1863, was serving as a private in Company A of the 116th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. On that day, near Vicksburg, Mississippi, Union commanders called for 150 unmarried volunteers to charge a heavily fortified Confederate position; Rundle answered the call. The volunteers were to build makeshift bridges across the trench immediately in front of the fortifications and then place ladders against the walls of the position. They would be followed by a large Union force which would used the newly placed bridges and ladders to storm the fort. The prospects for the volunteers were grim, and the group was accordingly known as the \\"forlorn hope\\". As Rundle and the others ran across the open ground in front of the fort, Confederate cannons opened fire and inflicted heavy casualties. The group was sent into disarray and efforts to continue the mission were abandoned. Rundle and the other members of the advance party sought cover in the trench at the base of the fort walls. The Confederates, unable to lower the aim of their cannons enough to fire into the Union soldiers, began lighting cannonballs and tossing them by hand into the trench. The fuses proved to be too long, however, and the Union soldiers were able to jump out of harm's way before they exploded. Some of the men, including Rundle, began picking up the lit cannonballs and throwing them back at the Confederates. The soldiers remained trapped until nightfall, when Rundle and others were able to escape back to the Union lines; only 30 of the original 150 men made it back. For these actions, he was awarded the Medal of Honor several decades later, on July 26, 1894. His official citation reads Later life and death After the war, Rundle moved to Colorado and owned a farm east of Grand Junction. He eventually married and, with his wife Hettie, had four daughters and two sons; one of his sons died in a 1905 railroad accident. Rundle sold his farm in 1902 and worked for the Grand Junction Post Office until his retirement in 1919. He was an active member of the Elks and the Grand Army of the Republic. In 1893, he was involved in a dispute with the Grand Junction city government regarding his dog. On May 27 of that year, Rundle was arrested after knocking away the snare of a city marshal who was attempting to capture the dog in accordance with a recently passed leash law. The case went to trial, with Rundle's lawyer arguing that the animal had been under the control of its owner at all times, and that the marshal had exceeded his authority by calling the dog over in order to snare it. The jury quickly found Rundle not guilty of interfering with a city marshal. Following his retirement, Rundle and his family moved to southern California in the hopes that the climate would be beneficial to his wife's health. He and his wife, Hettie, lived in an old soldiers' home; Rundle died there in 1924, at age 81, and Hettie in 1931. They were buried side by side at the Los Angeles National Cemetery.

The paper was the East Coast organ of Finnish- American members of the Communist Party USA. The paper moved to Worcester, Massachusetts in 1922 and to Yonkers, New York in 1931. In 1950 Eteenp√§in was merged with the Communist Party's Midwestern Finnish-language daily, Ty√∂mies (The Worker) to create Ty√∂mies-Eteenp√§in, which continued to be published from Superior, Wisconsin into the 1990s. Publication history=Political background In the summer of 1919, the Socialist Party of America (SPA), amidst much acrimony, split into three parts at its 1919 Emergency National Convention. Two new Communist Parties were established, with the moderate Socialist \\"Regulars\\" retaining control of the old party name, logo, and assets. In the run-up to this landmark party convention the SPA's governing National Executive Committee had suspended six large foreign language federations for having officially endorsed the Left Wing Manifesto around with the soon-to-be Communist Party dissidents were organizing their forces. This action, coupled with the revocation of the state charters of \\"left wing\\" dominated states such as Ohio, Michigan, and Massachusetts, deprived the left wing of its voting majority and assured the Regulars of victory at the convention in Chicago. This heavy-handed action taken against the non-English- speaking section of the Socialist Party came at a severe cost, however. Even though the Finnish Socialist Federation (SSJ), long regarded as one of the strongest bones in the Socialist Party's body, was not one of those endorsing the Left Wing Manifesto and thus incurring the NEC's wrath, many in the organization were sympathetic to the revolutionary socialist pronouncements of the Left Wing Manifesto and were disgusted by the actions of the NEC. At its 6th National Convention, held in Waukegan, Illinois from December 25, 1920 to January 2, 1921, the Finnish Socialist Federation after much heated debate voted 16-5 to withdraw from the Socialist Party of America and to continue instead its existence as an independent organization.Auvo Kostiainen, The Forging of Finnish-American Communism, 1917-1924: A Study in Ethnic Radicalism. Turku, Finland: Turun Ypliopisto, 1978; pg. 98. Upon learning of the decision of the Waukegan Convention to separate the Finnish Socialist Federation from the party, Socialist Party Executive Secretary Otto Branstetter immediately set about reorganizing a new Finnish Federation for the Socialist Party, an idea which had much support among the branches of the more moderate Eastern District of the Finnish Socialist Federation. In August 1921 a convention was held in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, home of the Eastern District's daily newspaper, Raivaaja (The Pioneer) and a new Finnish Socialist Federation organized.Tim Davenport, \\"Finnish Federations,\\" Early American Marxism website, Corvallis, OR. A large percentage of the Eastern District of the old Finnish Socialist Federation left that organization and joined the reorganized Finnish Socialist Federation affiliated with the SPA, bringing with them their newspaper, Raivaaja. The independent SSJ still had three regular and well established newspapers ‚Äî the daily Ty√∂mies (The Worker), published in the Upper Midwest, and the weeklies Toveri (The Comrade) and Toveritar (The Woman Comrade), published in Oregon. Despite this fact the radical Finnish-Americans of the East still felt they needed a newspaper published at a closer proximity to cover news of local concern and to this end they launched a new publication entitled Eteenp√§in (Forward). Formation Eteenp√§in was launched in New York City on May 25, 1921 under the editorship of Elis Sulkanen, until recently the editor of Toveri.Dirk Hoerder with Christiane Harzig (eds.), The Immigrant Labor Press in North America, 1840s-1970s: An Annotated Bibliography: Volume 1: Migrants from Northern Europe. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1987; pg. 214. In an effort to reduce expenses, the publication moved from New York to Worcester, Massachusetts in 1922. There was also a name change of the publisher at this time, with the initial \\"Bothnia Press Inc.\\" giving way to the \\"Eteenp√§in Co-operative Society.\\" The paper was typically four pages in length and strongly ideological in its coverage of the news. There was some limited Finnish presence in the underground Communist Party of America ‚Äî a shade over 400 dues-paying members by the end of 1921. This number was quite limited and its expansion difficult, however. In the estimation of Finnish Communist leader John Wiita (best known by the pseudonym \\"Henry Puro\\"), may Finnish-Americans were suspicious of illegal revolutionary propaganda activities, which they considered outlandish.Kostiainen, The Forging of Finnish-American Communism, 1917-1924, pg. 119. Eteenp√§in editor Elis Sulkanen, himself a participant in the underground Communist movement of 1920-1923, similarly noted that most radical Finns had no desire to join the underground organization, instead seeking to participate in a legal organization realistically participating in the actual politics of the United States. It was not until the establishment of the above ground and \\"legal\\" Workers Party of America (WPA) around New Year's Day of 1922 that Finnish radicals entered the communist movement en masse. The main body of the Finnish Socialist Federation ended its year of independent existence and joined the new WPA as a group at the time of the organization's founding convention, held in New York City. The Finns soon comprised the largest component of the WPA, outnumbering native English speakers and representing 40% of the total party membership by 1923. Eteenp√§in became a part of the WPA at this juncture and it remained a Communist Party publication throughout its nearly three decades of existence.Armas Kustaa Ensio Holmio and Ellen M. Ryynanen, History of the Finns in Michigan. Detroit, MI: Wayne State University Press, 2001; pg. 298. Development Eteenp√§in had a circulation of nearly 7,300 in 1924. By 1930, its press run averaged just shy of 11,000 copies per issue. A number of leading figures in the radical Finnish-American political movement were editors or managers of Eteenp√§in over the years, including original editor Sulkanen (later the author of an encyclopedic history of Finnish-American socialism), William Marttila, Toivo Vuorela, Onni Saari, K.E. Heikkinen, and John Wiita (Henry Puro). In 1931, the publication moved to Yonkers, New York, where it was published by a new holding company called \\"American Finnish Publishers, Inc.\\" The publishers of Eteenp√§in also issued a number of other Finnish-language radical publications over the years, including a Marxist theoretical magazine Viesti (The Message), a magazine directed at women called Ty√∂l√§isnainen (The Working Woman), and the annuals Punainen Kalenteri (Red Calendar), Vappu (May Day), and Ty√∂miehen Joulu (Worker's Christmas). Merger and legacy In 1950, Eteenp√§in was essentially dissolved when it was merged into Ty√∂mies, with the \\"new\\" joint publication (called Ty√∂mies-Eteenp√§in) being published from Ty√∂mies' Superior, Wisconsin offices. This paper continued through 1995, when it was replaced by the English-language publication, The Finnish-American Reporter.\\"Tyomies Society (Superior, WI), Records: Finding Aid,\\" Immigration History Research Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN. Eteenp√§in has been preserved almost in its totality. Microfilm of Ty√∂mies-Eteenp√§in (1950‚Äì1995) is available from the Wisconsin Historical Society at the University of Wisconsin.

It was a naval raid made by the Confederate river defense fleet, also known as the ‚Äúmosquito fleet‚Äù in the local media, on ships of the Union blockade squadron anchored at the Head of Passes. The mosquito fleet was supported by three fire rafts, which were ignited and followed the ironclad ram into the action. The attack occurred after moonset in the early hours of October 12, 1861, and routed the Union fleet, which fled in disorder down the Southwest pass of the delta. After sunrise Commodore George N. Hollins ordered the mosquito fleet to withdraw upriver.

Sketch map of the Mississippi River and the Head of Passes of the Louisiana deltaORN I, v. 16, p. 636. Background Louisiana seceded from the Union on January 26, 1861. A navy department was established by the newly created Confederate government by February 21, 1861. Commodore Lawrence Rousseau was sent by Confederate Naval Secretary Stephen Mallory to manage the naval defense of New Orleans. His efforts were undercut by Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who authorized the distribution of letters of marque and reprisal to the general population of the new Confederacy. These documents allowed the holder to capture Union shipping for prize money from the Confederate government, insuring that everything that would float in Louisiana was snapped up by private investors hoping to make a profit. Rousseau was left to wallow in the wake of citizens eager to make up for revenue lost by the Confederate embargo on cotton, the former main export of New Orleans. He was only able to purchase six civilian riverboats for conversion into a makeshift navy. Mallory then replaced the hapless Rousseau with George N. Hollins, a former navy veteran who was promoted to Commodore and sent to New Orleans on July 31, 1861. Hollins organized the haphazard collection of six armed riverboats and christened it the ‚Äúmosquito fleet‚Äù. His efforts to achieve more were impeded by Mallory's ironclad projects intended to produce two mighty warships, the CSS Louisiana and CSS Mississippi. These projects, and others authorized by Mallory tied up most of the resources useful to construction of more vessels for the mosquito fleet. Mallory was able to purchase two more civilian vessels for duty on Lake Pontchartrain. He received little support from Mallory, and seemed to be in competition with anyone else in New Orleans commanding aspects of its defense.Hearn, Capture of New Orleans, 1862, pp. 67-80. On the Union Navy side, command and operations were much more focused. With a longstanding naval staff and command structure there was less time wasted once hostilities at Fort Sumter established the inevitability of naval action. The strategy of a Union blockade was formulated by General Winfield Scott and proclaimed by President Abraham Lincoln on April 19, 1861. The blockade arrived off the Outer Pass of the Mississippi Delta when the arrived on May 27, 1861. The arrived off the Southwest pass on April 30. The arrival of these vessels was much sooner than anyone in New Orleans had imagined, and the panic-stricken rush that occurred when neutral shipping was given a fifteen-day grace period to vacate the port was an ugly dose of reality to stack against the concept of business as usual. The arrival of the and made the reality of the blockade more solid. Aboard the Niagara was Captain William W. McKean, the new commander of the Mississippi blockade. On October 10, 1861, McKean ordered four Union ships to occupy the Head of the Passes, closing all exits from the lower delta at one point.Hearn, Capture of New Orleans, 1862, pp. 32-43. For Commodore Hollins, time had run out. The prospect of the Union fleet occupying a base at the Head of Passes was intolerable. It was too convenient a point for an attack upon Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip, the last line of defense for New Orleans. Hollins responded by taking his flagship, , southward from New Orleans to concentrate the mosquito fleet at Fort Jackson. Once there he sent with a boarding party under Lieutenant Alexander F. Warley to commandeer the privateer ironclad ram Manassas at gunpoint for the Confederate Navy. John A. Stevenson, representing the privateer owners of the ram, was heartbroken when his vessel was wrenched from his control, and departed the vessel in tears. Hollins was unmoved because now his mosquito fleet seemed to have some chance against the much bigger vessels of the Union blockade. After moonset on October 12, in the hours of early morning, Hollins took his fleet south to engage the Union force at the Head of Passes.Hearn, Capture of New Orleans, 1862, pp. 84-5.

This vessel, a screw sloop with a ship rig, displaced 2,700 tons and mounted seven Dahlgren 9-inch smooth bores to a side and one rifled gun as a stern pivot. She also remounted one of her broadside guns as a bow pivot gun after anchoring by the lighthouse at the Head of Passes. Manned by an experienced crew of 260 well trained sailors, she was a behemoth compared to any vessel of the mosquito fleet. Each of the Dahlgren guns weighed 9,020 pounds and was 9 feet long. One broadside from the Richmond carried more firepower than could be mustered by the entire Rebel fleet. Each 73.5 pound exploding shell would wreak havoc on a cotton clad vessel, setting her aflame in a blast of splinters and iron fragments. Supporting the Richmond were the and . Each ship mounted 14 and 16 32-pounder smooth bores respectively, and were sloops of war with no power other than sail. The Vincennes also mounted a 9-inch smooth bore as a bow pivot gun. This was one of the guns intended for the shore battery at the lighthouse. Supporting the sail sloops was the , a side-wheel steam powered gunboat mounting one 32-pound smoothbore and one rifled 12-pound howitzer. The Water Witch was to provide towing capacity for the sail vessels under unfavorable wind conditions.Hearn, Capture of New Orleans, 1862, p. 83.Silverstone, p. 25.ORN I, v. 16, pp. 700-14. The weak link in this concentrated chain of firepower was the fleet commander and captain of the Richmond, Captain John Pope. Already unnerved by skirmishes with the on October 9, Pope had written to McKean, ‚ÄúI have to report that the Ivy has been down this afternoon and has made an attack upon these ships, throwing shot and shell over this ship and the Preble, keeping herself entirely out of range of any of the guns on either of the ships, her shot passing some 500 yards over this ship, which makes it evident we are entirely at the mercy of the enemy. We are liable to be driven from here at any moment, and, situated as we are, our position is untenable. I may be captured at any time by a pitiful little steamer mounting only one gun.‚ÄùORN I, v. 16, p. 699. The Ivy‚Äôs rifled gun did outrange Pope‚Äôs smooth bores, but at extreme range could not score any hits. Pope was obviously more of an administrator than a warrior, ready to flee from a mere reconnaissance element of Hollins‚Äô fleet. The possibility of setting up picket boats, ranging posts or illuminated marker buoys, illumination fires, or preplanned concentrations of gunfire did not occur to him. Hollins‚Äô mosquito fleet proceeded with a ruthless determination characteristic of its leader. His plan was to put the hijacked CSS Manassas in the lead. Following closely would be , McRae, and Ivy moving three abreast. Each gunboat would push a fire raft, which would be ignited after a signal from Manassas indicating that she had crushed the USS Richmond. The fire rafts were chained together, and would be released by the gunboats to engulf the Union fleet as it milled helplessly after the destruction of the Richmond. If the Manassas was turned into an oven in the process, Hollins considered the sacrifice worthwhile, despite the prospect of more bitter tears from Stevenson and his fellow investors. The Calhoun, the flagship, would remain in the rear, as would the and , seeking targets of opportunity.Hearn, Capture of New Orleans, 1862, p. 86 The Preble was the first to detect the Manassas, being anchored 200 yards upstream of the Richmond. She raised a red signal light into her rigging as a warning and opened fire. The Manassas presented only two and a half feet of armored deck above the waterline; the 32-pound shot of the Preble went high over her deck and scored no hits. The Manassas rang for flank speed, her engineers fed her fireboxes with the most flammable material to hand, and she leaped forward in a dense cloud of black smoke and sparks from her stacks. The Richmond was lashed to the coal schooner Joseph H. Toone on her port side, just off the lighthouse at the head of the Southwest pass on the east bank. The Manassas struck the Richmond a glancing blow on her port side just astern of the bow, wedging briefly between the Toone and Richmond. The momentum of the Manassas tore the Toone loose from Richmond and the Manassas continued past the Richmond‚Äôs stern. One of the two engines of the Manassas was torn loose by the impact, and she lost power. She turned away from the Richmond and moved slowly back upriver.ORN I, v. 16, pp. 712-14. 6.4-inch banded rifle, the weapon type used as the bow pivot gun on the CSS Ivy. Note the 100-pound conical projectile at the right rear of the gun carriage. This weapon outranged all of the guns in Pope's fleet. As a signal to release the fire rafts she was to fire three rockets. The first of these rockets was fumbled and flew back inside the Manassas, briefly panicking her crew. Recovering, the rockets were fired to signal the advance of the fire rafts. Alarmed by the rafts, all the vessels of the Union fleet slipped their anchor cables and moved downriver along the Southwest Passage, firing at the Manassas while doing so. Some of these projectiles knocked down one of the stacks of the Manassas, her only vulnerable projections above the rounded upper armor deck. Filling with smoke while crew members cut loose the damaged stack, she was grounded on the mud on the west bank of the head of the passes as the Union fleet headed to the southwest, pursued closely by the Confederate gunboats. The fire rafts grounded on the west bank of the southwest passage, south of Manassas, and the rebel gunboats being freed of the glare of the rafts between them and the targets, opened fire on the Union fleet. The Union fleet proceeded rapidly downriver, until at sunrise all ships but Preble grounded on the bar at the mouth of the river.Hearn, Capture of New Orleans, 1862, pp. 89-90. The Richmond grounded broadside to the bar in the center of the river mouth, and opened fire on the mosquito fleet. In turn the fleet maneuvered up river just out of range of the Richmond smooth bores, and returned fire with their longer ranged rifled guns. Despite the volumes of projectiles launched, few hits were scored. None of the Rebel vessels were hit; the Richmond was only hit twice, one shot wrecking one of the boats stored on the main deck, one passing into a gun port and coming to rest in the hull. By ten o‚Äôclock Commodore Hollins decided the mosquito fleet was running low on coal and ammunition, and ordered the fleet back upriver to Fort Jackson. The Manassas was taken back to the forts under tow.ORN I, v. 16, pp. 714-16. The final comic opera touch to the woes of the Union fleet was a mistaken signal in the last phase of the gun battle. Captain Handy of the Vincennes chose to misread a signal the Richmond made to the vessels outside the bar to ‚ÄúGet Underway‚Äù. Handy ordered the engineer to set and light a fuse to the magazine of the Vincennes to blow her up, then ordered the crew to abandon ship and report to the Richmond. Captain Pope on the Richmond was confronted with the unlikely spectacle of an officer even more timid and panicky than himself. Fortunately for the Union, the engineer of the Vincennes lit the fuse to the magazine as ordered, then cut off the burning end of the fuse and threw it overboard. Since no explosion was forthcoming, Handy and crew were ordered back to their ship by the disgusted Captain Pope.ORN I, v. 16, pp. 709-11. Aftermath Hollins returned to a hero's acclaim in New Orleans. Exaggerated accounts of the accomplishments of the mosquito fleet were placed in the newspapers of New Orleans and other Confederate cities in the east. The obvious superior strength of the Union fleet made the accomplishment an even more enviable feat. Aside from the rout of the Union blockading fleet there was little gain. Other than gleefully burning the timbers the Union fleet left at the Southwest Pass Lighthouse for a proposed shore battery, there was only a captured cutter filled with abandoned cutlasses and the crewless Toone. The schooner Toone still contained 15 tons of coal, but was a former prize of the Union fleet and an old leaky tub. The most severely damaged ship of the battle proved to be the Manassas, and most of the damage was done when she rammed the Richmond, rather than from enemy fire. The damage she did to the Richmond was a significant hull leak below the waterline, but this was not enough to sink or disable the Richmond.Hearn, Capture of New Orleans, 1862, pp. 94-95. The Manassas proved to be a disappointment. Although staffed with a courageous crew she was not fast, maneuverable, or durable enough to bring her iron ram into decisive action. The Richmond was not crushed with one blow, and once the Union fleet was underway the Manassas was completely ineffective, a one shot weapon system. Its psychological impact was tremendous, and lingered well beyond the river battle. Pope wrote to Flag-Officer McKean on Oct.14: \\"Everyone is in great dread of that infernal ram. I keep a guard boat out upriver during the night.\\" This apprehension would come to be known as \\"ram fever\\". In turn, the gunboats of the mosquito fleet were quite capable of outmaneuvering the Union fleet, but too light to damage it.ORN I, v. 16, p. 722. The Union naval command was mortified by the embarrassing setback. Flag-officer McKean, commanding the blockade at the river mouth stated, ‚Äú‚Ä¶and I am sorry to be obliged to say that the more I hear and learn of the facts the more disgraceful it does appear.‚Äù Union Naval Secretary Gideon Wells referred to the incident as ‚ÄúPope‚Äôs Run‚Äù. Long after the event, Admiral David Dixon Porter stated, ‚ÄúPut this matter in any light you may, it is the most ridiculous affair that ever took place in the American Navy.‚Äù Despite the outrage, the damage was easily repaired. On the 17th of October the and the Vincennes were sent in pursuit of the pestiferous CSS Ivy. Even though the Ivy was joined by another rebel steamer, both were driven up the Southwest passage to the Head of Passes where the chase was abandoned due to inability to close the range on the rebel vessels. The Richmond was sent to Key West, Florida, for temporary repair. The resignation of Captain Pope was accepted for health reasons. Captain Handy was sent east on the first dispatch ship. The West Gulf Blockading Squadron was organized under the command of Flag Officer David G. Farragut and sent to the Mississippi delta in far greater force. This counteroffensive would result in the Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip.Hearn, Capture of New Orleans, 1862, pp. 95-101.ORN I, v. 16, pp. 705-24.

The team existed from 1949 to 1960, and played as members of the Okanagan Senior Hockey League from 1951 onward. They were runners-up in the 1958 Allan Cup finals, and were the first ice hockey team from Canada to play an exhibition tour in the Soviet Union. History The Kelowna Packers were established in 1949 in Kelowna, British Columbia. The Packers finished first place in the Okanagan Senior Hockey League (OSHL) during the 1957‚Äì58 season. In that year's playoffs, the Packers defeated the Kamloops Chiefs in a best- of-seven series to win the OSHL championship. In the Western Canada playoffs, the Packers defeated the Winnipeg Maroons to win the T. B. Patton Cup. The Packers qualified for the 1958 Allan Cup finals against the Eastern Canada champion Belleville McFarlands, but lost in seven games. In May 1958, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association approved sending its first Canadian team on an exhibition tour of the Soviet Union. The Kelowna Packers were chosen as the Allan Cup finalists. CAHA secretary-manager George Dudley arranged a five- game tour in the Soviet Union, and for three subsequent games in Sweden. Dudley hoped that the Kelowna tour would promote future cultural exchanges with Eastern Europe. Outside Kelowna, there were critics of this decision and some predicted that the Packers would return without so much as a single win. The Packers lost their first game against the Russian Army team 4‚Äì3. They tied the next two games 1‚Äì1 against the Wings of Soviet and 2‚Äì2 against the Moscow Dynamos. In the fourth game, against the Soviet Juniors, the Packers won 4‚Äì3. In the final match, they faced the Moscow Selects, and won 5‚Äì1. During the Packers' exhibition tour of Sweden, they won two of three games played versus the Sweden men's national ice hockey team. Each game finished in a 5‚Äì2 score. In the 1959-60 season, the Packers again captured the OSHL title. The team folded after the season.

However, in a passport application dated November 29, 1911, Baird listed his date of birth as May 18, 1875. - May 16, 1953) was an American civil engineer, football player and coach. He played football for the University of Michigan from 1892 to 1895 and was captain of the 1894 team. He was also an assistant football coach at Michigan from 1897 to 1898. He worked for the George A. Fuller Co. for 23 years and eventually became its president. He later formed his own construction company called the James Baird Company. Baird directed the construction of many important buildings, including the Flatiron Building, Lincoln Memorial, Arlington Memorial Amphitheater, and Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Early years Baird was born in Vanceburg, Kentucky and attended high schools in Chicago, Illinois and Ann Arbor, Michigan. His father, Lyman Beecher Baird (September 6, 1833 - October 24, 1907), was an Ohio native who worked as a farmer and merchant. In the 1880 United States Census, Lyman Baird was identified as a grocer in Vanceburg.Census entry for Lenion Baird.

He also operated a hardware store in Vanceburg that burned in the 1880s.Lewis County By William M. Talley, Paula Franke, p. 18. His mother was Frances Amelia (Halbert) Baird, and he had an older brother Charles A. Baird (born c. 1869). University of Michigan He enrolled at the University of Michigan where he played quarterback for the football team from 1892 to 1895. He was captain of the 1894 Michigan team that finished with a 9-1-1 record and recorded the school's first victory against one of the Eastern football powers with a 12-4 win over Cornell at the Detroit Athletic Club's field in Detroit. Baird played quarterback for the 1895 Michigan team that compiled an 8‚Äì1 record, won seven of their games by shutouts, and outscored their opponents by a combined score of 266 to 14. The sole loss of the 1895 season was a 4‚Äì0 setback against the Harvard Crimson, then one of the three great football powers. Michigan finished the season with a 12‚Äì0 win over Western rival, Amos Alonzo Stagg's Chicago Maroons. Undefeated against Western opponents, the 1895 Wolverines laid claim to the Western football championship. At the end of the 1895 season, one Chicago newspaper, the Daily Inter Ocean selected Baird as the substitute quarterback on its All-Western team. Baird studied civil engineering at Michigan and received his bachelor's degree in 1896. Baird's brother Charles A. Baird was the manager of the 1894 and 1895 football teams at Michigan and later became the university's first athletic director. After graduating, Baird served as an assistant football coach at Michigan from 1897 to 1898, including the 1898 Michigan team that won the school's first Western Conference championship. At the end of the 1898 season, the Chicago Inter-Ocean singled out Baird for his work in coaching the Michigan team: > \\"They had been a disorganized team three weeks before, but Jimmy Baird had > come on to maneuver the backs, stop the fumbling, and put snap and life into > the team. As a coach, he has been a wonderful success. No one who knows his > record as a captain can doubt that he is a worker of miracles to whose power > Michigan's wonderful improvement is due.

Lincoln Memorial under construction in 1916. Freer Gallery of Art Hutchins Hall at the University of Michigan Law School After graduating from Michigan, Baird had a successful career in the construction industry. He started as a timekeeper for the Guaranty Construction Co. of Chicago and then as an engineer for Moulton-Starrett Co. of Columbus, Ohio, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1899, Baird began a 23-year association with the George A. Fuller Co., a leading builder of skyscrapers and inventor of the modern contracting system. In December 1900, The New York Times wrote: > \\"No other firm in the world, perhaps, has played so large a part in > revolutionizing the building trade as the George A. Fuller Company, and to > it primarily is due the credit of having originated many of the actual > construction methods now in use.\\" Baird began working for the Fuller Company in New York City and directed the erection of the Flatiron Building, the first steel-frame skyscraper in New York City. He moved to Boston in 1902 as the firm's general superintendent. He was transferred to Washington, D.C. in 1904 as a district manager. He rose through the ranks of the company to become vice president in 1910 and president in May 1922. While working with the Fuller Company, Baird supervised the construction of the Lincoln Memorial and the Arlington Memorial Amphitheater in 1916, the Commodore Hotel in 1919, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in 1921, and the Freer Gallery of Art in 1923. As the Lincoln Memorial neared completion, Baird wrote to World's Work magazine, \\"It is to be hoped that the Lincoln Memorial Building may exist for at least one thousand years, unless destroyed sooner by artificial means.\\" During World War I, Baird volunteered to construct cantonments for the U.S. Army to house 20,000 to 30,000 men. In November 1918, at the end of hostilities, Baird applied for a passport to travel to France and Belgium to represent the Fuller Company in selling building materials to be used in the post-war reconstruction efforts. Bernard Baruch, Chairman of the War Industries Board, wrote a letter in support of Baird's application in which he stated: > \\"This is to certify that I know Mr. James Baird personally and have known > him practically all my life, and that I know him to be an American born > citizen born in Vanceburg, Ky. about 45 years ago. I know his father also, > an American citizen born in America.\\"U.S. Passport Application for James > Baird. In 1923, as a building boom created a shortage in skilled construction workers and supervisors, Baird served as Chairman of the Emergency Committee of the Mason Builders' Association. He was an outspoken advocate for additional funding for teaching the building trades in the schools. In 1925, Baird formed his own construction company, the James Baird Construction Co., Inc. Baird and his company specialized in large construction projects and were responsible for the construction of many notable structures, including the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C., an addition to the Corcoran Gallery of Art that opened in 1928, the dome at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church, New York, the Brooklyn Printing Plant of The New York Times (design by Albert Kahn), Hutchins Hall and the Cook Dormitory at the University of Michigan Law School, the Aeolian Building in New York, the Ferncliff Mausoleum in Hartsdale, New York, and the original ten buildings of the Madeira School in McLean, Virginia, and the Reynolds Building in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Upon completion of The New York Times' Brooklyn printing plant, the newspaper called the marble, granite, steel, copper and concrete the \\"jewel box\\" and noted that no expense had been spared in its construction. Family and philanthropy Baird was married to Cornelia Cornelia Curtis (born May 1875) at Chicago on March 28, 1900. They lived in Manhattan, and later in Washington, D.C. and the Village of Scarsdale, New York, and had two sons, John C.

Baird served as a trustee of the Village of Scarsdale from 1926 to 1927. He was also a member of the Scarsdale Golf Club and the American Guernsey Cattle Club of Peterborough, New Hampshire. In 1939, Baird donated his farm at Pleasant Valley, New York to the State of New York for use as a park. The park is now known as James Baird State Park. In 1936, Baird traveled to Tucson, Arizona to seek relief from asthma. His health improved, and he made his permanent residence in Tucson for the last 17 years of his life. Baird was active in philanthropic causes in Tucson and donated $207,422 in 1948 to establish a scholarship fund at the University of Arizona. At the time Baird's gift was \\"the largest single scholarship gift ever made to the University of Arizona.\\" In May 1951, Baird received an honorary degree of doctor of engineering from the University of Arizona in recognition of his work as an engineer, builder, contractor, business executive and philanthropist. In January 1948, Baird welcome the University of Michigan Marching Band to Tucson as they returned from the 1948 Rose Bowl. He gave Michigan officials a tour of the University of Arizona campus and presented them with citrus from trees at the Baird residence at 4111 Calle El Centro in Tucson. Michigan's band conductor, William Revelli, told Baird the welcome received in Tucson was the most enthusiastic received and that the band members were pleased with the turnout. In May 1953, Baird died two days short of his 80th birthday at St. Mary's Hospital in Tucson after a month's illness. Baird's widow died at Tucson in 1962. He was buried in the Baird family plot at Oakwood Cemetery in Chicago.

Its purpose was to create a viable substitute for tropical hardwoods by recycling plantation coconut palms. Although palms are extremely hard and durable, their unique properties made them difficult to work using conventional techniques. At Sigatoka in the Fijian Islands, Pacific Green set up the world's first factory - Pacific Green Industries (Fiji) Limited - dedicated to the research and development of coconut palms. Palmwood was chosen as the sustainable exterior wood for Masdar, the world's first 'eco-city' in Abu Dhabi, including gates, screens and doors.http://www.greenprophet.com/2011/02/pacific-green-masdar- gates/ Development of hardwood substitutes Palmwood was the name Pacific Green gave to the finished ‚Äòhardwood‚Äô material it developed.

In 2002, Fomalont and Sergei Kopeikin claimed to have measured the speed of gravity in the dedicated experiment by observing the tangential component in the gravitational bending of light of a quasar caused by the orbital motion of Jupiter with respect to the barycenter of the solar system. This claim was disputed but vigorously defended by Kopeikin and Fomalont in a number of subsequent publications. Fomalont is an active participant in many international radio interferometric projects including the VLBI Space Observatory Programme and Square Kilometre Array.

History A careful survey was made of the entire Island of Oahu in 1940 for sites on which landing fields could be constructed. With the exception of the Kƒ´papa Gulch area, all level ground that might be available for airfields was either so occupied, projects were underway for preparation of airfields, or the turbulence in the air created by the close proximity of mountain ranges precluded such development. The Kƒ´papa Gulch area was the only site remaining where an airfield could be constructed. The date of construction of the Kƒ´papa airfield has not been determined. Kƒ´papa means 'Paving the Way' in Hawaiian. This airfield served to pave the way for many military units going overseas. The site commonly referred to as the Kƒ´papa Gulch area was selected because it could accommodate two 5,000-foot runways free from obstructions. Two reasons precluded the use of the area initially. First was that it was located about two-thirds of the distance between Pearl Harbor and Wheeler Field which would further increase the congestion of the air over that part of the island. Secondly, it would remove from cultivation a highly productive tract of land. The principal objection to the use of this site, which was congestion of the air over the Pearl Harbor area, was much less of a handicap because the site was proposed for use by the U.S. Navy for the training of carrier groups rather than as a station for U.S. Army pursuit aviation. The use of this site by the Navy would permit the concentration of carrier-group training for Naval aviation on the south side of the island of Oahu including Barber's Point, Kipapa Gulch, and Ford Island. As the training from these stations would be entirely under Naval control it lends itself to aerial traffic regulations which would be difficult to attain if large numbers of airplanes of the two services were intermingled. The Kƒ´papa Gulch area was advantageously located for occupancy of carrier-group aviation in that the site was readily accessible to the parent vessels of the carrier groups. It facilitated in the transfer of personnel and supplies to and from the parent vessels in Pearl Harbor. Lastly, It was advantageous in making for ease of supervision of the training of all carrier-based Naval aviation. World War II started before the airfield was constructed. During the war it apparently saw little use by the Navy due to the fact that carrier aircraft were constantly deployed during the war. The United States Army Air Corps became the principal user of the airfield by default. Kƒ´papa Field was a major transiting point for units going overseas. Aircraft from this airfield searched and patrolled over the surrounding Pacific area, maintaining a 24-hour vigil to avert any attack. A large number and variety of squadrons are documented to have been stationed at Kƒ´papa Airfield during World War II. * The 5th Bombardment Group, 31st Bombardment Squadron, transferred from Hickam Field to Kƒ´papa Field with B-17's and B-18's on 23 May 1942 until 9 September 1942 when they moved to Kualoa Airfield. * The HQ 90th Bombardment Group, 321st Bombardment Squadron arrived at Kƒ´papa Airfield 12 September 1942 from the mainland United States with B-24s and began flying their first missions by November 1942. * The Thirteenth Air Force, 307th Bombardment Group, 370th Bombardment Squadron arrived at Kƒ´papa Field 2 November 1942 from the mainland United States with B-24s and flew sea-search missions between November‚ÄìDecember 1942. * The 18th Fighter Group, 6th Fighter Squadron, moved from Kahuku Airfield to Kƒ´papa Airfield with P-70s on 17 November 1942. * The 28th Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron, Seventh Air Force (attached to VII Fighter Command), flying F-5s was based at Kƒ´papa Airfield in July 1944. * The 38th Bombardment Group, 70th Bombardment Squadron, equipped with Martin B-26 Marauders was kept on alert with 500-pound bombs at Kƒ´papa Field during the time that the Battle of Midway was in progress. Other units that spent time at Kƒ´papa Airfield included: The 302nd Fighter Control Squadron October 1944; The 318th Fighter Group, 19th Fighter Squadron 30 May 1943, flying P-40's; The 92nd Air Refueling Squadron 18 March 1945, flying B-24‚Äôs Liberators; The 45th Airlift Squadron 9 September 1945; the 4th Emergency Rescue Squadron June 1944; and the Seventh Air Force, 549th Combat Training Squadron 20 October 1944 to 19 February 1945, flying P-61 Black Widow night fighters performing training and defense duties. Many other different types of aircraft used Kƒ´papa Field during World War II including: P-40B, P-40F, P-70, P-61A, P-61B, and C-46D, because all were involved in accidents in the area. The airfield was closed shortly after the end of World War II. Nothing remains today of the former Kƒ´papa Airfield. Its central location and level area made it ideal for development. The property has become a Mililani Town housing development. The entire airfield area is located south the Mililani Golf Course between Meheula Parkway and Hokuala Streets. Mililani District Park is located near the intersection of the two main runways; unfortunately, there are no indications of this site's military history.

Part of it is now the Kualoa Regional Park. History Kualoa Airfield was constructed in 1942 and used during World War II on 1000 acres of Kualoa Ranch land. It was a satellite field for units assigned to Bellows Field and was used mainly for training. The aircraft ramp was made of perforated high strength steel (Marston mats) that was used extensively by the military during World War II for quickly establishing airfields. Kualoa Field consisted of a single north/south runway. It was depicted as having a single 6,500' hard-surface runway. The road to Kaaawa and the north shore crossed over Kualoa's runway, so the cars would have to wait whenever an airplane took off. The 28th Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron, operating P-38, F-4 and A-24 aircraft was stationed at Kualoa between October 9, 1944 and May 8, 1945. The 18th Fighter Group, operating P-40‚Äôs, also was stationed there briefly. No evidence suggests that Kualoa was ever paved. The entire runway was formed of pierced steel planking. The steel planking makes a strong case that the military had no plans to keep Kualoa open any longer than it was needed. Following the war the land was returned to the original owners. Today Mokolii, \\"Chinaman's Hat\\" The airfield stretched across Kamehameha Highway from Kualoa Ranch to what is now Kualoa Regional Park. What's left of Kualoa's former runway is now a dirt road stretching from north of the Kualoa Ranch visitor center, and through to the maintenance yard. The entrance to Kualoa Regional park off of Kamehameha Highway was once part of the airstrip. The property inland became Ahupuaa O Kahana State Park and Kualoa Ranch. The only remaining aviation activity at the site is occasional use by model airplane flyers that use the grass field. A few of the fortified revetments along the sheer cliffs above the former airfield still remain intact, including Battery Cooper, as the only remaining indication of this site's military history. Kualoa point land is the northern end of KƒÅneohe Bay. The small island Mokolii, often called \\"Chinaman's Hat\\", is right offshore. The road is called Kamehameha Highway, state route 83.

The remnants of Atlantic Tropical Depression Nine tracked westward across the Caribbean Sea, entering the Pacific Ocean on September 3. It slowly developed, and organized into a tropical depression on September 8. It strengthened into a tropical storm on September 10, thus earning the name Octave. After strengthening into a hurricane the next day, Octave started to steadily intensify en route to a peak as a Category 4 hurricane of the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale. After reaching peak winds of 135 mph (215 km/h) on September 13, Octave moved into a region of cooler waters. The hurricane weakened into a tropical storm on September 14, and degenerated further into a tropical depression the next day, before dissipating on September 16. The remnants of the storm brought moderate rainfall to parts of California and Arizona, as well as three F0 tornadoes. Meteorological history Hurricane Octave originated from a tropical wave that left west coast of Africa on August 21, 1989. Moving westward, the wave became better organized and developed into Atlantic Tropical Depression Nine on August 27. However, strong wind shear inhibited further development of the system, leading to it degenerating to a tropical wave. Upon weakening to wave, the system was situated roughly east of the Lesser Antilles. Continuing westward, the system moved through the Caribbean Sea without significant development before crossing Central America and entering the Pacific Ocean on September 3. After remaining stationary for several days, the system was upgraded to a tropical depression on September 8 about south of the Mexican coastline. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the convection became well- organized. Octave took a general northwestward track as it intensified, becoming Tropical Storm Octave later that day. Upon being named, Octave had developed a good outflow and shear was decreasing, leading to forecasters at the National Hurricane Center anticipating the storm to become a hurricane. The storm slowly strengthened over the following two days, becoming a strong tropical storm early on September 11. Octave later reached hurricane intensity late on September 11. as it developed an eye. Meanwhile, Octave was being steered by an anticyclone over Mexico and a trough to the west allowed the hurricane to continue northwest. Continuing to intensify, it was soon upgraded to Category 2 status on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale. During the afternoon of September 13, Octave intensified into a major hurricane, a storm with sustained winds of at least 111 mph (178 km/h). Early the next day, the hurricane attained peak intensity as Category 4 hurricane, based on the Dvorak technique, a tool used to estimate tropical cyclone intensity. At this time, maximum winds were estimated at 135 mph (215 km/h) along with a barometric pressure of 94.8 kPa (27.99 inHg). Shortly after its peak, the storm moved over cooler waters, with sea surface temperatures estimated to be as low as . By the end of the September 13, the eye of Octave had become less defined as the hurricane weakened. Steady weakening took place as the storm continued a northwesterly track due to a trough. By September 14, Octave was downgraded into a tropical storm as winds dropped below 75 mph (120 km/h) The system began to weaken rapidly as it turned towards the west, and it was downgraded to a tropical depression late on September 15. After turning back towards the east, Octave rapidly dissipated on September 16 as steering current diminished. The remnant low dissipated on September 16 while located off the Baja California coastline. Preparations and impact Prior to the arrival of Octave, the NHC issued public advisories. The advisories noted that of rain was possible in the higher elevations. The possibility of a dissipating prior to landfall was also noted. Octave came within of Socorro Island. As a result, the weather station there reported winds of and a pressure of . In addition, its remnants did move into California. In the Sacramento Valley, the city of Redding recorded of rain in a 12-hour span and in 24 hours. Sacramento also recorded in 6 hours. Light rainfall was reported throughout southern California, with enough falling in Los Angeles to make streets slippery. Moisture associated with Octave produced isolated showers in thunderstorms in parts of southern Arizona on September 16. In addition, a power outage in Lodi, California affected 7,000 customers. Octave also produced minor damage to the grape and raisin crops.

The brothers formed their first gigging group, Live Sex Shows, in 1981. The band was fronted by singer Ken Chinn, whom they had met through the skateboarding subculture in Edmonton.Chris Walter. ...What No One Else Wanted to Say. Vancouver: GFY Press, 2012, pp. 8 The short-lived band quickly broke up, but the three formed a new group called Society's No Fucking Use, which was shortened to SNFU.

Belke also played drums in the short-lived group Bing Jesus in the early 1980s. Although many of the members of SNFU were involved in the band's compositions, Belke was the primary musical songwriter for much of the band's history, with Chinn as the lyricist. After three LPs in the 1980s and a temporary disbandment, the group relocated to Vancouver in 1992 and signed to Epitaph Records. They released three further albums with Epitaph. In 1990, shortly after the first SNFU breakup, Marc and Brent Belke formed the Wheat Chiefs, adding power pop and melodic hardcore influences to their punk rock sound. In the Wheat Chiefs, Marc sang lead vocals and continued to share guitar duties with his brother.

It is no longer called a nuchal fibroma, but instead a \\"nuchal-type fibroma\\" since it develops in other anatomic sites. There is no known etiology.  Signs and symptoms  These lesions are generally asymptomatic, although patients give a long history of a solitary, superficial mass. The mass is usually in the neck (hence the name \\"nuchal-type\\"), but it can be seen in the extremities, lumbosacral area, buttocks, and face. There is a strong association with diabetes mellitus and Gardner syndrome; in fact, it may be the initial manifestation of Gardner syndrome.  Pathology A low power of a nuchal-type fibroma showing entrapped fat. The tumors are unencapsulated and poorly circumscribed, showing a firm, white cut surface. Most tumors are about 3.5 cm, but can be up to 8 cm. By microscopic examination, there are haphazardly arranged thick collagen fibers, with a low cellularity and no pleomorphism. There are usually entrapped fat cells, skeletal muscle, and peripheral nerves. The may be perineural fibrosis. The elastic fibers may be altered, which is why an elastofibroma is considered in the differential diagnosis. Nuchal fibroma  Immunohistochemistry  The tumor cells are strongly positive for vimentin, CD34, and sometimes with CD99. There is often (up to 2/3rds) a nuclear reaction with Œ≤-catenin. Diagnosis= Differential diagnoses  The differential diagnosis includes elastofibroma, fibrolipoma, desmoid-type fibromatoses, and nuchal fibrocartilaginous pseudotumor.  Management  Simple excision is curative. However, in patients with Gardner syndrome, up to 45% will develop desmoid-type fibromatosis at other sites, and so this should be searched for and excluded. Patients can develop a recurrence, so follow-up is required.  Epidemiology  This is a rare tumor, presenting over a wide age range, but usually in the 3rd to 5th decades of life. There is a slight male predilection, although this is not seen in syndrome associated patients. The most common site is the posterior neck, but may also be seen in other sites (extremities, lumbosacral area, buttocks, face).

As a result of the California Gold Rush after 1849, California's name became indelibly connected with the Gold Rush, and fast success in a new world became known as the \\"California Dream\\".Kevin Starr, Americans and the California Dream, 1850‚Äì1915 (1986) California was perceived as a place of new beginnings, where great wealth could reward hard work and good luck. The notion inspired the idea of an American Dream. California was seen as a lucky place, a land of opportunity and good fortune. It was a powerful belief, underlying many of the accomplishments of the state, and equally potent when threatened.Starr, Americans and the California Dream and Starr, Inventing the Dream (1985) Historian H. W. Brands noted that in the years after the Gold Rush, the California Dream spread across the nation: : Overnight, California gained the international reputation as the \\"golden state\\"‚Äîwith gold and lawlessness the main themes.Robert A. Burchell, \\"The Loss of a Reputation; or, The Image of California in Britain before 1875,\\" California Historical Quarterly 53 (Summer I974): 115‚Äì30, shows that stories about Gold Rush lawlessness deterred immigration for two decades.

Jurmain, California: a place, a people, a dream (1986) p. 141 Psychology Observers report a common stereotyped perception that people are happier in California. This perception is anchored in the perceived superiority of the California climate, and is justified to some extent by the fact that Californians are indeed more satisfied with their climate than are Midwesterners, with much of California enjoying a Mediterranean climate. Surveys of students show the advantages of life in California were not reflected in differences in the self-reported overall life satisfaction of those who live there.Schkade and Kahneman. \\"Does Living in California Make People Happy? (1998) 20th century Historian Kevin Starr in his seven-volume history of the state has explored in great depth the \\"California Dream\\"‚Äîthe realization by ordinary Californians of the American Dream. California starting in the late 19th century promised the highest possible standard of life for the middle classes, and indeed for the skilled blue collar workers and farm owners as well. Poverty existed, but was concentrated among the migrant farm workers made famous in The Grapes of Wrath, where the Joad family, driven out of the Dust Bowl, searches for the California Dream. By the 1950s the Joads and the other \\"Okies\\" and \\"Arkies\\" (migrants from Oklahoma and Arkansas) were achieving the dream too. It was not so much the upper class (who preferred to live in New York and Boston). The California Dream meant an improved and more affordable family life: a small but stylish and airy house marked by a fluidity of indoor and outdoor space, such as the ubiquitous California bungalow and a lush backyard‚Äîthe stage, that is, for quiet family life in a sunny climate. It meant very good jobs, excellent roads, plentiful facilities for outdoor recreation, and the schools and universities that were the best in the world by the 1940s. James M. Cain, an eastern writer who visited the Golden State, reported in 1933 that the archetypal Californian \\"addresses you in easy grammar, completes his sentences, shows familiarity with good manners, and in addition gives you a pleasant smile.\\"Kevin Starr, Golden Dreams: California in an Age of Abundance, 1950‚Äì1963 (2009) Cultural phenomena which have fed into the California Dream include the rise of the Hollywood film industry, Silicon Valley, California's aerospace industry, the California wine industry and the Dotcom boom. The phrase has been used in describing Californian's struggles to find a suitable location in the state to achieve success, in 2017, when the cost of living in places like the San Francisco Bay Area were prohibitive. The phrase \\"Taking the Cure\\" was conjured to describe 1950s \\"u-haul\\" migrants who, after a year or so pined for home. One drive back home was enough to convince them to stay after all. Popular culture 1907 sheet music for Glorious Southern California The term has been referenced in numerous media, most notably in the song title California Dreamin', with \\"California dreaming\\" used in book and film titles that reference some aspect of the California Dream, such as the 2007 film California Dreaming, and the 2005 UK reality TV series California Dreaming. Lawrence Donegan's California Dreaming: A Smooth-running, Low- mileage, Cut-price American Adventure references the California, (and American) Dream. Also referencing it is poet Christopher Buckley's Sleepwalk: California dreamin' and a last dance with the '60s. Numerous songs have been written about the California Dream.

The company develops and manufactures medical devices that enable the therapeutic use of the adult stem and regenerative cells naturally found within adipose (fat) tissue. Commercial activities are focused on cosmetic & reconstructive surgery, cell banking, and supplying research tools. Company history Cytori Therapeutics, Inc. is a late stage cell therapy company developing autologous cell therapies from adipose tissue to treat a variety of medical conditions. The company was created as the result of a 2002 merger between Macropore Biosurgery Inc. (founded in 1996) and StemSource Inc. (founded in 2000). The joint company operated under the Macropore name until 2005 when it changed its name to Cytori Therapeutics. Cytori is headquartered in San Diego, CA, and also has operations in Japan and the United Kingdom. Core technology: the Celution System Cytori develops cellular therapeutics formulated for specific diseases and medical conditions. Clinical development programs are currently targeting impaired hand function in scleroderma (Phase III clinical), osteoarthritis of the knee (Phase II clinical), and thermal burn injury (preclinical phase). Cytori‚Äôs cellular therapeutics are collectively known as Cytori Cell TherapyTM, and consist of different formulations of a heterogeneous population of cells (including stem cells) that are involved in response to injury, repair and healing. This cell therapy product is prepared from a patient‚Äôs own adipose (fat) tissue using the company‚Äôs fully automated Celution¬Æ System that disaggregates adipose tissue and liberates the entrapped stem and regenerative cells that naturally reside in native adipose. The system formulates a cell therapy product that is available for delivery to the patient within 1‚Äì2 hours of tissue collection. Cytori‚Äôs lead indication is currently in a US phase III, FDA approved, pivotal study, the STAR TRIAL (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02396238), designed to evaluate one administration of Cytori‚Äôs ECCS-50 in treating impaired hand and finger function from scleroderma. The STAR Trial initiated June 2015, completed enrollment of 88 patients in June 2016 and Cytori anticipates follow up data to be available mid-2017.https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1095981/000156459016028714/cytx-10q_20160930.htm The company has also recently completed a US, FDA approved, Phase II study, ACT-OA TRIAL (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02326961), to examine ECCO-50 safety, feasibility, and dosing in the treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee.https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1095981/000156459016028714/cytx-10q_20160930.htm Preliminary data was released Q2 2016.http://ir.cytori.com/investor- relations/news/news-details/2016/Cytori-Reports-Second-Quarter-2016-Business- and-Financial-Results/default.aspx Cosmetic and reconstructive surgery The Celution System was introduced into the European and Asia-Pacific cosmetic and reconstructive surgery market in 2008. Since that time, physicians in Europe and Japan have been using ADRCs to enrich fat grafts for a number of cosmetic applications including breast reconstruction, breast augmentation, facial rejuvenation and buttock augmentation, among others. RESTORE I RESTORE I was an independent Japanese study that examined reconstruction of partial mastectomy breast defects using ADRCs isolated using the Celution System. The 21 patient study was found to be safe and well tolerated in all patients. The study showed a high (79%) level of patient satisfaction with the final outcome.Kitamura, Kaoru, et al., ‚ÄúStem Cell Augmented Reconstruction: A New Hope for Reconstruction After Breast Conserving Therapy‚Äù. 30th Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Poster #4071. RESTORE 2 Following the promising results of RESTORE I, Cytori launched its own European breast reconstruction post-marketing study, named RESTORE 2, in June 2008. The 70 patient study was designed to assess patient and physician satisfaction, improvement in overall breast deformity, imaging, quality of life, and safety among other measures. The study completed enrollment in November 2009, with all patients to be followed up at both six and 12 months. Six month interim results on 32 patients were presented at the 32nd Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium on December 12, 2009. In addition to reinforcing the safety of the procedure, the RESTORE 2 study showed that 73% of patients and 82% of physicians were satisfied with the outcome of the procedure.Weiler-Mithoff, Eva, et al., ‚ÄúCell-Enhanced Reconstruction after Breast Conservation Therapy: A Proven Technique‚Äù. 32nd Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Poster #4123. Fat grafting In addition to Celution, Cytori developed the Puregraft System which allows the physician to wash and purify the fat tissue before reinjection into the same patient, standardizing the fat graft preparation process. Cytori received a 510(k) for market clearance of the Puregraft System in January 2010 for use in aesthetic body contouring using autologous fat grafts.Seaman, Marley (8 January 2010) ‚ÄúCytori Gets FDA Approval for Puregraft System‚Äù, Associated Press. In addition to the Puregraft System, Cytori has developed the Celbrush, a precision fat graft delivery tool. Cardiovascular disease Cytori is sponsoring two European safety and feasibility studies for the treatment of cardiovascular disease using ADRCs extracted using the Celution System. APOLLO Cytori‚Äôs APOLLO study was designed to evaluate the use of ADRCs in the treatment of patients who have undergone myocardial infarctions. In March 2009, the study‚Äôs Steering Committee and the data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) deemed that the safety and feasibility goals of the study had been met after the enrollment of 14 patients. Primary outcomes for the study will be assessed at the six month follow up. The ADRC therapy resulted in a reduction in infarct size by 60%, and significant improvement of LV perfusion (MIBI SPECT) and an improvement of left ventricular function by 6% at 6 month followup. At 36 months FU, the improvement on infarct size persisted, as well as the effect LV function. A progressive improvement of cardiac remodelling was noted. PRECISE Cytori‚Äôs PRECISE study evaluates the use of ADRCs to treat patients suffering from chronic myocardial ischemia. Enrollment in the trial was completed in May 2009 with the enrollment of 27 patients. Primary outcomes of the study will be assessed at six months. StemSource and stem cell banking Cytori has also developed StemSource, automated laboratory equipment for tissue processing and cell extraction system for research use. The StemSource equipment is available worldwide. Stem cell banking In addition to use in laboratory research, StemSource is the centerpiece of Cytori‚Äôs StemSource Cell Bank platform for cryopreservation and storage of a patients‚Äô adult stem and regenerative cells (ADRC‚Äôs). The StemSource Cell Bank allows hospitals and companies to offer their patients the option of harvesting, preparation and storage of their adipose tissue or their processed ADRC‚Äôs. Once the adipose tissue is extracted and prepared using the StemSource equipment, the storage technology freezes the tissue/cells at -196 degrees Celsius, which drastically slows the metabolism of the cells, preventing future aging or deterioration and preserving them for potential future use, should clinical applications be approved by governmental authorities. Other research and applications The Celution System is being used in Japan and Europe as tool for independent investigation and development of additional therapeutic uses of ADRCs. Some of these investigations include stress urinary incontinence, wound healing, liver insufficiency, renal failure and peripheral artery disease.

One side is carved to depict educator and American women's rights advocate Emma Willard seated at a desk, and holding a pen as she writes. A globe, ink well, and books are depicted on the desk. The words \\"In memory of Emma Hart Willard Who Wrote at Middlebury in 1818 the Magna Carta for Higher Education of Women in America\\" are carved above the relief. On the opposite side of the memorial, the carved inscription reads, \\"Education Should Seek To Bring Its Subjects to the Perfection of their Moral, Intellectual and Physical Nature, in order that they May be of the Greatest Possible Use to Themselves and Others 1787 - Emma Hart Willard 1870\\". The relief is unsigned. Information Emma Hart Willard (February 23, 1787 ‚Äì April 15, 1870) came to Middlebury, Vermont in 1807 to run the Middlebury Female Seminary. She left her position at the Seminary in 1809 when she married a local doctor and banker John Willard. Due to a financial reversal in 1814, Emma Willard began to teach women at the collegiate level in her home, and, thus, is credited as being the start of women's collegiate education in the United States. The quote on the reverse side of the monument is taken from Willard's An Address to the Public, particularly to the Members of the Legislature of New York, proposing a Plan for Improving Female Education, published in 1819. Acquisition The sculpture was designed and sculpted with funding from the Federal Arts Project, and erected with funding from the Works Progress Administration. Since its dedication in 1941, the Emma Willard Memorial has been maintained by the Daughters of the American Revolution and is presently administered by the Daughters of the American Revolution, Ethan Allen Chapter, Middlebury, Vermont. Artist American artist/illustrator Marion Guild was employed by Pierre Zwick, a painter and director of arts for the state of Vermont under the Works Progress Administration, to create the memorial's design. Guild is perhaps best known for creating the pop-up illustrations for the 1939 edition of Robert L. May's Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. Zwick was initially solely credited for the design of the memorial. Condition This sculpture was documented as well maintained in 1992 as part of Save Outdoor Sculpture!, a campaign organized by Heritage Preservation: The National Institute of Conservation partnered with the Smithsonian Institution, specifically the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Throughout the 1990s, over 7,000 volunteers cataloged and assessed the condition of over 30,000 publicly accessible statues, monuments, and sculptures installed as outdoor public art across the United States. In Vermont, the survey was sponsored by the Vermont Museum and Gallery Alliance from 1992-1993 where 110 volunteers surveyed 242 sculptures dating from 1740 to 1993. The archives from the project are maintained by the Vermont Historical Society.

It is the law school of Ohio Northern University, and the second oldest law school in Ohio, founded in 1885. The college is centered in Tilton Hall, a modern building that houses all law classes and the Taggart Law Library. The College of Law is located on the East-North-East side of the tree-lined Ohio Northern University campus. It is currently ranked the #136 best law school by US News.  History View of Tilton Hall to the West Founded in 1885, the Ohio Northern University Pettit College of Law is the second oldest of the nine Ohio law schools and a founding member of the Ohio League of Law Schools. As such, it is one of the oldest law schools in the United States. It was named in honor of Claude W. Pettit, a judge and former dean of the college. ONU Law has been fully accredited by the American Bar Association since 1948 and a member of the Association of American Law Schools since 1965. Academics Entrance to Tilton Hall (ONU College of Law) at night The ONU College of Law is accredited by the American Bar Association and is a member of the Association of American Law Schools.http://www.americanbar.org/groups/legal_education/resources/aba_approved_law_schools/by_year_approved.html In 2019, the law school was ranked 136 by the U.S. News & World Report.https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/ohio- northern-university-03125  Curriculum  ONU law students can choose from nine specialized tracks, 12 guaranteed clinical and externship placements and more than 100+ course options while also expanding their experience by studying abroad, participating in Law Review, accepting research and teaching assistantships, participating in pro bono programs or taking an active role in Moot Court. ONU Law is regarded for its ability to blend legal theory with practical training.  Bar Passage Rate  ONU's bar passage rate for first- time takers of the July 2019 Ohio Bar Examination was 100%, while its bar passage rate for first-time takers in any jurisdiction in 2019 was 84.44%. For the July 2018 bar exam, ONU had a bar passage rate of 70.6%. For the July 2017 bar exam, ONU had a bar passage rate of 86.7%. Democratic Governance and Rule of Law LL.M. ONU Law is home to the Democratic Governance and Rule of Law LL.M. program. The program, founded in 2006, is a subsidized one-year program of study designed for lawyers practicing in the public or non-profit sector. It is open to those whose first law degree was earned from a law school outside the U.S. as well as American lawyers interested in pursuing careers in the international development field. Upon completion of the LL.M., foreign students are required to commit to 2 years further public service upon return to their home countries. The unique curricular scope of the program covers topics relevant to lawyers, judges and public officials in transitioning states, including a strong focus on rule of law reforms. The LL.M. program was cut by the University in response for a need to lower costs. The final class of LL.M. students will graduate in May 2020, with the program ending following their graduation. Post-graduation employment According to ONU Law's official ABA-required disclosures, 81% of the 2018 graduating class was employed in full-time professional positions 10 months after graduation (71% in bar passage required or JD advantage positions). Positions were in various size law firms, federal and local judicial clerkships, public interest, government, higher education, and businesses.http://law.onu.edu/sites/default/files/class_of_2016_employment_summary.pdf The National Law Journal lists ONU Law has having one of the highest percentage of alumni, 38.1%, which are underemployed.https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/the-20-law-schools-with-the- most-underemployed-graduates/ Costs The cost of tuition at ONU Law for the 2019‚Äì20 academic year is $29,260.

UNOMIL's mandate was then modified as follows: :(a) to support the efforts of the Liberian National Transitional Government (LNTG) and Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in the implementation of peace agreements; :(b) to investigate violations of the ceasefire and recommend measures to prevent future occurrences; :(c) to monitor compliance with the military components of the peace agreements, including the disengagement of forces, disarmament and observance of the arms embargo; :(d) to contribute towards the maintenance of assembly sites and the implementation of a demobilisation programme; :(e) to support humanitarian activities; :(f) to report violations of human rights to the Secretary-General; :(g) to observe the electoral process. The number of military observers in UNOMIL was set at 160. All parties were urged to implement the provisions of the Abuja Accord, while the transitional government was asked to take action to avoid further violations of the ceasefire. All countries were reminded to observe the arms embargo imposed on Liberia in Resolution 788 (1992), with all violations of it reported to the Committee established in Resolution 985 (1995). The Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) was asked to provide security to UNOMIL personnel. In this regard, all Liberian parties were called upon to respect the status of both peacekeeping forces and respect international humanitarian law. The repatriation of refugees had to be better co-ordinated. Finally, the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was requested to submit a progress report to the Council by 15 December 1995.

It is the product of the 1996 union of Sportverein Corso/Vineta and Weddinger Fu√üballclub. __TOC__ History=Corso 99 Berlin Predecessor Berliner Sportclub Corso was established on 1 June 1899 in the city district of Prenzlauer Berg. In addition to football, the club had departments for athletics, billiards, and bowling. In 1905, they spent a single season in the Oberliga Berlin (I) and were relegated after a last place finish. Corso took part in the Berliner-Pokal (Berlin Cup) tournament in 1909 and advanced to the semi-finals where they were put out by Viktoria 89 Berlin. The club remained active in lower tier ball and in 1920 joined with SC Wacker Tegel to form Sportclub Wacker-Corso 99 Berlin in a brief merger that ended that same year. Corso made another single season appearance in the Oberliga Berlin/A in 1927‚Äì28.Gr√ºne, Hardy (2001). Enzyklop√§die des deutschen Ligafu√üballs 7. Vereinslexikon. Kassel: Agon-Sportverlag. . Following World War II, occupying Allied authorities disbanded organizations throughout the country, including sports and football clubs. The team was reestablished as Sportgemeinde Prenzlauer Berg-Nord in 1945 and on 17 January 1949 took on the name SG Corso Berlin. On 14 June they joined BSG Eintracht Aschinger Berlin to play as BSG Eintracht 49 Corso Berlin. That was also a short-lived union and the two clubs went their own separate ways as SC Corso 99 Berlin and Sportverein Eintracht 49 Berlin on 14 January 1950. The raising of the Berlin Wall in 1961 had a significant impact on the club. Although based in the western part of the city, much of the club's membership lived in the east. Corso was reduced to a membership of just 17, but managed to carry on. Mergers to present-day On 2 June 1972 they merged with Spielvereinigung Vineta 05 Berlin, which prior to 28 April 1953 had played as Hakoah Berlin, to form SV Corso 99/Vineta Berlin. The current day club was formed 1 June 1996 through union with Weddinger FC 1908 which was the successor to SC Teutonia Berlin. Established in 1899, Teutonia brought together the traditions of a long list of early Berlin clubs. Today the club plays in the tier ten Kreisliga B.

It resembles a three-dimensional (i.e. with three degrees of freedom instead of only two) version of the Light cycles game from the film Tron. Gameplay The game takes place in a 16 √ó 16 √ó 16 three- dimensional grid with the display being a first-person view of what the player can see in front of them. Initially empty, this space is filled up by the player (who constantly moves forward) leaving a trail behind them. There are a number of computer-controlled \\"chasers\\" doing the same thing who leave a differently coloured trail behind them. As the player and the chasers move through the grid, it becomes more and more densely filled, and therefore there is a greater likelihood of crashing into a trail and need to change direction to avoid the trails. Reception CRASH magazine commented that it was hard to see how Knot worked at first, but described it as extraordinary and addictive. ZX Computing also said that Knot was initially confusing until the player is used to the perspective. The graphics were highlighted as some of the best fast-action colour graphics on the Spectrum. Accolades In 1991 Your Sinclair magazine ranked the game 60th in their top 100 Spectrum games of all time.

It is about south east of Cairo. The monastery is also known as the Monastery of the Tigers. Foundation and history The Monastery of Saint Paul the Anchorite dates to the fourth century AD. It was founded over the cave where Saint Paul the Anchorite lived for more than eighty years. The first travel narrative of the monastery was provided by Antoninus Martyr, a native of Placentia, who visited the tomb of Saint Paul the Anchorite between the years 560 and 570 AD. The first monks to occupy the monastery were some of the disciples of Anthony the Great after they knew the story of Saint Paul the Anchorite it might have been occupied by Melkites for a short period , but they were followed by Egyptian again and Syrian monks. The Syrians may have had a sustained existence at the monastery, for it appears that they also occupied the monastery during the first half of the fifteenth century, after which their presence disappeared. According to an isolated Ethiopian reference, the 70th Coptic Orthodox Pope, Gabriel II (1131‚Äì45 AD), was banished to the monastery of Saint Paul the Anchorite for three years. Like most of Egypt's monasteries, this one suffered repeatedly at the hands of Bedouin tribes. The most destructive of their raids was in 1484 AD, when many of the monastery's monks were killed and the library was put to the torch. The monastery was later rebuilt under the patronage of Pope Gabriel VII of Alexandria (1526‚Äì69 AD), who sent ten monks from the Syrian Monastery to populate the monastery of Saint Paul the Anchorite. During the second half of the sixteenth century, the monastery was again attacked and ransacked twice by the Bedouins, forcing the monks to finally leave. The monastery remained deserted for the following 119 years, only to be repopulated by a group of monks from the Monastery of Saint Anthony under the patronage of Pope John XVI of Alexandria (1676‚Äì1718 AD), who promoted an extensive reconstruction of the monastery in 1701 AD. Modern history The modern monastery has three different churches. That of Saint Paul the Anchorite, built underground, was originally dug into the cave where the saint lived and where his remains are kept. The two other churches are named after Saint Mercurius and Archangel Michael. The monastery is surrounded by high walls, built during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It also has a tower (keep), an ancient refectory, a mill, and a spring that is believed to have served Saint Paul the Anchorite during his eighty years of seclusion in this area. A second spring, known as the Pool of Mary is named after Mary, the sister of Moses, who is believed to have washed her feet there during the Exodus. This monastery has many illustrated manuscripts, including the Coptic version of the Divine Liturgy and the Commentary of the Epistle to Titus by Saint John Chrysostom.Tour Egypt Popes from the Monastery of St. Paul the Anchorite #Pope John XVII (1727-1745) Abbot Bishop Daniel, Abbot of the Monastery of Saint Paul, was born in 1959. He was consecrated a monk at the Monastery of Saint Paul in 1983 and then ordained priest in 1985. In 1997 Fr. Daniel was elevated to hegumen and appointed deputy of the monastery. He was ordained bishop and abbot of the monastery in 2006 by Pope Shenouda III. The late Bishop Agathon, previous abbot of the Monastery of Saint Paul, was born in 1922.

The opera was first performed on November 6, 1955, in a nationwide telecast by the NBC Opera Theatre. Background Following the success of Gian Carlo Menotti's Amahl and the Night Visitors, NBC decided to present new operas by other American composers and gave Foss a commission for the work. (Other composers involved in the project included Norman Dello Joio, Stanley Hollingsworth, and Leonard Kastle.) Griffelkin's plot is based on a story that Foss's mother told him when he was a child. Foss composed an early version of the opera shortly afterward. Synopsis Griffelkin is a young devil residing in hell's nursery. On his tenth birthday, he is allowed to spend a day on earth to do as many bad deeds as he can. To aid him in the task, he is given a magic potion that will bring objects to life. Griffelkin arrives in a city and causes havoc by bringing a statue, a mailbox, and a pair of stone lions to life. He is soon drawn to a human girl about his age. To impress her, he transforms a storeful of toys into a ballet troupe. However, the girl runs home to check on her sick mother, leaving Griffelkin to search for her while being chased by the townspeople and the lions. Later that evening, Griffelkin finds the girl and her brother mourning their mother's death. Moved by their plight, he secretly uses the last of his potion to bring the mother back to life. As the family is reunited, Griffelkin dissolves in tears. His day on earth at an end, Griffelkin is summoned back to hell, where his outraged fellow devils place him on trial for his compassionate conduct. Griffelkin is found guilty; as punishment, he is transformed into a human boy and banished from hell. Griffelkin then returns to the city and again finds the girl and her family, who remember the events only as a bad dream. When the family invites Griffelkin to live with them, he happily accepts. Productions The original 1955 NBC production starred Adelaide Bishop as Griffelkin and featured sets and costumes by Rouben Ter-Arutunian and choreography by Robert Joffrey. The opera's stage premiere took place the next year at the Tanglewood Music Festival with Mildred Allen in the title role. The opera has received several revivals, most notably by the New York City Opera in 1993 and the Manhattan School of Music in 2007. In 2002, the Boston Modern Orchestra Project presented Griffelkin at Tanglewood in a concert performance honoring Lukas Foss's 80th birthday. The group recorded the opera shortly thereafter.

The game cards resemble smaller, thinner versions of the Game Pak ROM cartridges used for previous portable gaming consoles released by Nintendo, such as the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance. The mask ROM chips are manufactured by Macronix and have an access speed of 150 ns.  Nintendo DS = Nintendo DS Game Card  Clockwise from left: A Game Boy Color Game Pak cartridge, a Game Boy Advance Game Pak cartridge, and a Nintendo DS Game Card. On the far right is a 21 mm coin shown for scale. Cards for the Nintendo DS ranged from 64 megabits to 4 gigabits (8‚Äì512 MB) in capacityNi no Kuni was the first DS game to use a 4-gigabit card The cards contain an integrated flash memory for game data and an EEPROM to save user data such as game progress or high scores. However, there are a small number of games that have no save memory such as Electroplankton. According to an IGN blog by the developer of MechAssault: Phantom War, larger (such as 128 MB) cards have a 25% slower data transfer rate than the more common smaller (such as 64 MB) cards; however, the specific base rate was not mentioned.  Nintendo DSi Game Card  In 2008, the Nintendo DSi was launched. The console offered various hardware improvements and additional functions over previous Nintendo DS iterations, such as the inclusion of cameras. While many Nintendo DS titles released afterwards included features that enhanced gameplay when played on the Nintendo DSi console, most of these games retained compatibility with the original DS iterations sans enhanced features. However, a select few retail game titles were released that worked exclusively for the Nintendo DSi consoles for reasons such as requiring camera functions, and these titles have game cards with white-colored casings (all DSi-exclusive games are region locked). Examples of such game cards include Picture Perfect Hair Salon. While these white game cards can be physically inserted into original Nintendo DS consoles, their software did not function due to the missing hardware features. These DSi-exclusive game cards are fully compatible with the Nintendo 3DS family. Prior to the release of the Nintendo DSi, Nintendo encouraged developers to release DSi-exclusive games as DSiWare downloadables instead of retail game cards that would not function on older Nintendo DS consoles.  Infrared support  Despite all iterations of the Nintendo DS line lacking native infrared support, certain titles made use of this type of communication function using game cards with their own infrared transceivers. These game cards are generally glossier and darker than common Nintendo DS game cards, and reveal their translucency when exposed to light. Examples of such game cards include Personal Trainer: Walking and Active Health With Carol Vorderman, which connect to the included pedometers, Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver, which connect to the included Pok√©walker accessory, and Pok√©mon Black and White and Pok√©mon Black 2 and White 2, which connect to other games. Although all iterations of the Nintendo 3DS family support native infrared functions, Nintendo DS games still use the infrared-enabled game cards themselves when played on a 3DS system, reserving the native infrared for Nintendo 3DS-specific software.  Nintendo 3DS  Game cards for the Nintendo 3DS are from 1 to 8 gigabytes in size, with 2 GB of game data at launch. They look very similar to DS Game Cards, but are incompatible and have a small tab on one side to prevent them from being inserted into a DS.  Nintendo Switch  A Game Card from above (left) and from behind (right). The Nintendo Switch uses cartridges that are officially called Game Card. This iteration is smaller and has a larger storage capacity than its previous versions. Despite its similarities, the Switch is not compatible with DS and 3DS cards. The game cards used in the Switch are non-writable and save data is stored in the console's internal memory, unlike the DS and 3DS's game cards, which are writable and are able to store save data. \\"Nintendo Switch game cards are non- writable; game save data is stored in internal NAND memory.\\" Due to their size, the Game Cards are coated with denatonium benzoate, a non-toxic bitterant, as a safety precaution against accidental consumption by young children. Videos of users intentionally tasting the cartridges and reacting with disgust at the taste became a meme prior to the console's launch, which originated from Jeff Gerstmann's actions on a Giant Bomb webcast. The cartridges come in a variety of capacities: 1 GB, 2 GB, 4 GB, 8 GB, 16 GB and 32 GB. 64 GB cartridges were planned to be introduced in the second half of 2018, but due to unspecified circumstances, Nintendo originally delayed the launch of this variant to 2019, then delayed again to 2020. 64 GB cartridges will use XtraROM technology from Macronix.
