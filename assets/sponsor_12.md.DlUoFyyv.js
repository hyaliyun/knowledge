David Thompson.Donat de Chapeaurouge: Paul Klee und der christliche Himmel, Franz Steiner Verlag, Stuttgart 1990, p. 10 ff.Provenance  History  The origin of the title of the picture is unclear. On the one hand, the Bauhaus Dessau organised a \\"bart-herzen-nase-fest\\" (beard heart-nose festival) in 1928, at which Klee's student Herbert Bayer was also present. On the other hand, Klee chose the title Nase, Mund, Br√ºste; B√ºste, Lippen, Br√ºste (nose, mouth, breasts; bust, lips, breasts) for another work as early as 1927. Klee's friend Hans Arp also created a painting called Kopf, Augen, Nase, Schnurrbart (Head, eyes, nose, moustache).  Description  A small red heart is centrally located in a broad pale red cross that extends almost across the entire image. In the upper left-hand corner, in the manner of a child's drawing, a stylized head with a white headband, plate-round blue eyes without pupils, the nose marked by a thin line, below it a tiny mouth, indicated by two parallel lines. Clockwise, in the next corners, on each elongated grey-blue colour spot, there follows a stick with one hand, a stick with hand and foot and another stick with a foot, which, like the other parts of the body, is executed in a pale red colour. The ground of the picture is in a broken white with slight grey or blue-grey shadows on the ground and in the upper left corner of the picture.  Interpretation  The watercolour is seen as a disguised depiction of Christ with a parodistic undertone. With regard to the blasphemy trial against George Grosz, Klee wanted to avoid a possible blasphemy accusation. The picture shows an atheistic position, clearly documented from text and picture testimonies of the artist from his entire creative period.  Reception  In 1999, Marianne Schroeder was influenced by the watercolour for her composition Wie der Klee vierbl√§ttrig wurde (How the clover became four-leaved). The work was premiered by the Ensemble Sortisatio and recorded on the CD 8 Pieces on Paul Klee.

Judaism  A Mizrah wall hanging; the word Mizrah (, \\"East\\") appears at the center Jews traditionally pray in the direction of Jerusalem, where the \\"presence of the transcendent God (shekinah) [resided] in the Holy of Holies of the Temple.\\" Within the Holy of Holies lay the Ark of the Covenant that contained the Ten Commandments tablets given to the prophet Moses by God; this is the reason that the Temple of Solomon became the focal point for Jewish prayer. In the Bible, it is written that when the prophet Daniel was in Babylon, he \\"went to his house where he had windows in his upper chamber open to Jerusalem; and he got down upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he had done previously\\" (cf. ). After the destruction of the Temple of Solomon, Jews continue to pray facing Jerusalem in hope for the coming of the Messiah whom they await. The Talmud (Berakhot 30a) instructs Jews outside the Land of Israel to face the Holy Land while praying; Jews residing in Israel should turn towards the city of Jerusalem; those living within Jerusalem should orient themselves towards the Temple Mount, and those next to the Temple Mount should turn towards the former site of the Holy of Holies. The Shulchan Aruch (Code of Jewish Law) thus specifies that in synagogues, the Ark should be placed such that \\"worshipers may pray in the direction of the Holy Land and the place of the Sanctuary in Jerusalem\\". When synagogues are erected, they are built to face Jerusalem. The Mizrah (literally, \\"East\\") is a plaque or other decorative wall hanging which is placed on the eastern wall of many homes of Jews in the Diaspora to the west of Israel, in order to mark the direction of Jerusalem towards which prayer is focused. A Mizrah plaque is often an artistic, ornate piece, being written in calligraphy and featuring a panorama of Jerusalem. Mizrah wall hangings typically feature the Hebrew word Mizrah (), and may include the verse from the Torah which states, \\"From the rising of the sun unto its going down, the Lord's name is to be praised\\" (cf. ).  Christianity  Throughout history, believers hung a Christian cross on the eastern wall of their homes to indicate the eastward direction towards which they focused their prayers. Since the time of the early Church, the eastward direction of Christian prayer has carried a strong significance, attested by the writings of the Church Fathers. In the 2nd century, Syrian Christians hung a Christian cross on the eastern wall of their house, symbolizing \\"their souls facing God, talking with him, and sharing their spirituality with the Lord.\\" Two centuries later, Saint Basil the Great declared that one of the unwritten commandments of the Church was to pray facing east. Nearly all Christian apologetic tracts published in the 7th century A.D. in the Syriac and Arabic languages explicated that the reason that Christians prayed facing the east is because \\"the Garden of Eden was planted in the east () and that at the end of time, at the second coming, the Messiah would approach Jerusalem from the east.\\" Throughout Christendom, believers have hung or painted a Christian cross, to which they prostrated in front of, on the eastern wall of their home in order to indicate the eastward direction of prayer, as an \\"expression of their undying belief in the coming again of Jesus was united to their conviction that the cross, 'the sign of the Son of Man,' would appear in the eastern heavens on his return (see ).\\" Communicants in the Oriental Orthodox Churches today (such as those of the Coptic Orthodox Church and Indian Orthodox Church), and those of the Mar Thoma Syrian Church (an Oriental Protestant denomination) pray the canonical hours contained in the Agpeya and Shehimo breviaries respectively (a practice done at seven fixed prayer times a day) facing the eastward direction.  Islam  The mihrab of a Umayyad Mosque in Damascus; this niche in the masjid's wall orients Muslims in prayer towards Mecca. In Islam, the direction of prayer is known as the qibla and this direction is towards the Sacred Mosque (al-Masjid al-·∏§arƒÅm) of Mecca. Originally the qibla of Muhammad and his followers in Medina was towards Jerusalem, but it was changed to Mecca after the Quranic verses (Al-Bakarah 2:144, 2:145) that Muslims believe was revealed in the second Hijri year (624 CE), about 15 or 16 months after Muhammad's migration to Medina. If a person does not know which direction they are facing, that individual should pray in the direction that he/she feels is towards Mecca. All mosques are supposed to be designed to be oriented towards the qibla. A niche known as the mihrab is built into the wall of a mosque that faces Mecca so that Muslims know in which direction to pray. The determination of qibla has been an important problem for Muslim communities throughout history. Muslims are required to know the qibla to perform their daily prayers, and it is also needed to determine the orientation of mosques. Originally, various traditional methods were used to determine the qibla, and from the eighth century onwards Muslim astronomers developed methods based on mathematical astronomy, especially computations techniques based on spherical trigonometry using a location's latitudes and longitudes. In the fourteenth century, the astronomer Shams al-Din al-Khalili compiled a table containing the qibla for all latitudes and longitudes. Scientific instruments, such as the astrolabe, helped Muslims orient themselves for prayer facing the city of Mecca.  Bah√° º√≠ Faith  In the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, the Qiblih is the direction of prayer towards which adherents focus. It is a ‚Äúfixed requirement for the recitation of obligatory prayer‚Äù.

She gathered intelligence on the Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO) on behalf of the Tatmadaw before she was caught and executed by the KNDO.  Biography  Chit Po was born in February 1908 in Tavoy (Dawei), Tenasserim Division. She married Corporal Hla Maung (a cook in No.1 Military Engineer Battalion), in Maymyo (Pyinoolwin) in 1947.  Service  In 1949, the Tatmadaw was fighting the Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO). One of the issues the Tatmadaw had was a lack of access to intelligence. Chit Po, using a variety of disguises, which included a helmet, a cane for herding cows and a sleeping bag, entered the KNDO camp and reported back enemy artillery positions. Shortly afterwards, Chit Po was arrested, interrogated, and killed by the KNDO on 8 April 1949. She was 41 (in her 42nd year). On 16 May 1949, her body was buried in a military ceremony.  Legacy  Thura Ma Chit Po's Grave Chit Po was posthumously awarded the Thura medal in 1950. She is still the only female winner of the medal; 516 medals have been awarded to men. Her name is inscribed on the Heroes' Temple in Naypyitaw. A statue of Chit Po was erected in the Friday Garden in her hometown of Launglon Township, Dawei District, in 2017. The sculptor was Maung Kyaw; the statue is over two metres tall, and shows Chit Po holding a machete and a bag of grenades. The 110th anniversary of Chit Po's birth was commemorated in Pyin Oo Lwin in February 2018, organised by the Pyin Oo Lwin Township Writers' Association.

He uses stop-motion puppet and cut-out animation techniques to produce short films and music videos. Life and career Wallace grew up in Bristol and developed an interest in animation through short films made by Aardman Animations, the Bristol-based studio known for its stop-motion clay animation techniques. He studied at Newport Film School, receiving a BAFTA Cymru nomination in the \\"Short Form & Animation\\" category for his graduation film, The Man Who Was Afraid of Falling, in 2012. He was then made a BBC Performing Arts Fellow in 2015 and included in a list of 32 \\"Ones to Watch\\". Wallace has also worked in theatre, and has likened the process of working with animators, and of animators getting to grips with puppets and the characters they represent ‚Äì building an atmosphere informing the work ‚Äì to directing a theatre play. Wallace collaborated with P√©ter V√°cz on the 2016 music video for the track \\"Dear John\\" by British band James. Wallace and V√°cz had met as students on \\"Animation Sans Fronti√®res\\", an animation course, and have collaborated on a number of projects over the years, as well as teaching stop-motion animation together. In 2017, Wallace created a critically acclaimed stop-motion puppet music video for the Sparks song \\"Edith Piaf (Said It Better Than Me)\\". Depicting a surreal adventure set in 1930s' Paris, the video used wire puppets moving in cardboard scenery with painted backgrounds and was completed in just six weeks' time. Wallace was given a great amount of artistic freedom for the video and Sparks were very pleased with the result, pronouncing it a \\"work of art in its own right\\" that perfectly captured the song's mood, and \\"perhaps Sparks' best video ever\\". 2018 saw Wallace make a music video for Parker Bossley's track \\"Chemicals\\", using cut-out animation, a technique Wallace had previously employed in a short film titled Natural Disaster. Bossley had seen Natural Disaster and was interested in a video using a similar type of collage animation technique to depict a psychedelic trip in which the lead character metamorphoses into various animals. The video won a nomination in the short film category at the 2019 Palm Springs International Animation Festival. Wallace has also been working for some years on Salvation Has No Name, a 16-minute stop-motion tale about the refugee crisis, and was invited by Aardman Animations co-founder Peter Lord, who admired Wallace's work, to set up production in Aardman's studio. The film is part-funded by the British Film Institute and will feature the English- language debut of Itziar Itu√±o as well as the voice of Yasmine Al Massri. Production was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, with about a third of the film's shoot completed.

As a folklorist, his work was crucial due to his discoveries of tales and poems from the remotest villages of eastern Bengal (now Bangladesh). His most celebrated work is Momenshahir Loka-Sahitya dedicated to folk literature in Momenshahi (Mymensingh) Yazdani was one of the most popular Bengali poets in the Pakistan period. Early life and education Yazdani was born in the village of Bidyaballabh, Kendua in the District of Mymensingh (now in Netrokona District) on 27 February 1918. His father, Shaykh Ali Kabir, was a practitioner of alternative medicine. After completing primary education at a local Old Scheme madrasa, Yazdani studied in Ashujia High School until class 10. Around this time at the age of 18, his mother died and Yazdani became negligent of his education and started accompanying syncretic mystics. Yazdani eventually left these mystics, returning back to orthodox Sunni Islam after marrying Zubaydah Akhtar Khatun, a Bengali Muslim woman with whom he started a family. Career Yazdani had took on multiple career paths throughout his life. He started working as a primary school teacher at a village in 1940. Shortly afterwards, he became a clerk of the Debt Settlement Board. He later began his career in grade one proofreading for Franklin Publications in 1956 as well as The Azad. He left his job as a proofreader in 1959 due to ill health and returned to his village home and devoted himself to literary pursuits. He was inspired by the likes of Kazi Nazrul Islam and Jasimuddin as well as the rich puthi literature (Dobhashi poetry) of Bengal. His poetry focused much on the glory of Muslims as well as village life. Poems about the latter include Chinu Bibi and Rongila Bondhu. Some of his poems were about rebellion like Bojrobani. With a growing hobby of collecting Bengali language folk literature, Yazdani became known as a folklorist. He started writing up essays on folk literature which were published in popular journals and newspapers. He was awarded the Adamjee Literary Award by the President of Pakistan Ayub Khan in 1959. This was for writing Khatamun Nabiyyeen (Seal of the Prophets), a biographical poem on Muhammad, the final Islamic prophet in verse. This poem was later translated to English as The Word of God. Works Yazdani has published 27 books and 18 unpublished books. His most famous works are those relating to folk literature: *Momenshahir Lokshahitto (1951) *Purbo Pakistaner Lokshahitto (1966) He also wrote poems, namely: *Bojrobani (Words of Lightning) - 1947 *Chinubibi - 1951 *Rongila Bondhu (Colourful Friend) - 1951 *Khaatamun Nabiyyeen (Seal of the Prophets) - 1960 *Yusuf Zulaykha (Joseph and Potiphar's wife) Other writings: *Bhangabeena (Broken Harp) - 1944 *Neel Doriya (Blue Sea) - 1946 *Rahgeer (Passerby) - 1949 *Islam Jahaner Dui Setara (Two Stars of the Islamic World) *Khulafa-i-Rashideen (Rightly Guided Caliphs) *Morur Kafela (Desert Caravan) *Hridoy Beena (Harp of the Heart) *Momenshahir Prachin Polli O Shomaj Jibon (Momenshahi's Ancient Rurality and Social Life) Death and legacy Yazdani died in his native village on 23 June 1967 at 8:30am. Prior to his death, he had been invited to the world's first folklore conference at Indiana University in the United States in 1968 as a researcher, collector and composer of East Pakistani folklore. He left behind two sons and a daughter. An educational institution in his name was established in Kendua in the year 1965 - the Rowshan Ijdani Academy.

The database consists of inventory listings of more than 5,600 works and 23,000 manuscripts written in Old High German and Middle High German discovered in 34 different countries. The physical documents themselves are presently dispersed throughout over 1,400 libraries, archives, museums and private collections. The manuscripts date from the 8th into the 16th century. Origin The working group Handschriftencensus was founded in 2006 as a location-independent network of academic researchers from Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Until recently the project was seen as informal from an institutional perspective, but came to be regarded as a formal project. The members of the working group initially contributed to and maintained the database of their own accord. Handschriftencensus emerged from a project sponsored by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG): the Marburger Repetorium of German language manuscripts of the 13th and 14th centuries. Since 2007 Handschriftencensus has been supplemented with similarly formatted descriptions of German language manuscripts dating to before 1200 by the Paderborner Repetorium of the German language traditions of the 8th to 12th centuries. Handschriftencensus have been partnered with the Academy of Science and Literature in Mainz, Germany (Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur) since 2017. The Handschriftencensus project is currently based at the Institute of German Philology of the Middle Ages of the Philipps University of Marburg. Structure and function Each manuscript or fragment is listed as an individual data record. A description includes the basic information. Apart from the centralized registering of the textual contents, the basic codicological data, such as the number and size of the leaves, type of material and rough date of origin of the manuscript is specified, as well as linguistic information as to the language and regional dialect. The database also lists present and past locations of the manuscripts to aid in accurately matching their provenance to older research. The complexity level of the descriptions vary and are continuously expanded upon. They range from the simple verification of signatures along with brief bibliographical references to complex and extensive documentation of codicological, paleographical, linguistic and literary data accompanied by secondary literature references and, when available, links to further online resources, especially to digitized manuscript images. The author and work catalog, coinciding with designations found in the 2nd edition of the Verfasserlexikon, presents an overview of all known relevant manuscripts together with their current locations and signatures. A list of editions and their printings follows the compilation of tradition data and can be called up with a link. A component bibliographic database 'Research Literature about Medieval German Language Manuscripts' furnishes a complete searchable and cumulative register of academic references cited in the individual manuscript descriptions.  Reception and use  Handschriftencensus is consulted world-wide as a center for the research of tradition documents: medieval German language fragments and manuscripts, for ascertaining them and their description norms, i.e. work and signature, as well as the identity of the text. Handschriftencensus has been used by many English language Germanists and medievalists such as the University of Oxford's philologist Nigel F. Palmer.

Routes 90 and 92 trips are roughly 70 to 80 minutes. Background Routes 90 and 92 operate daily between Anacostia station (90) or Congress Heights station (92) and Duke Ellington Bridge (90) or U Street station (92). Route 90 operates along Howard Road and Martin Luther King Jr Avenue. Route 92 operates along Alabama Avenue, Naylor Road and Good Hope Road before reaching Martin Luther King Jr Avenue. Both lines merge on the intersection of Martin Luther King Jr Avenue and Good Hope Road and operate along M Street, 8th Street, Florida Avenue, and U Street. The 92 terminates at U Street station while the 90 continues along U Street, 18th Street, and Calvert Street before terminating at Duke Ellington Bridge. The line is the 4th busiest Metrobus line in the system as of 2016 averaging almost 12,000 riders. Additional route 90 trips operate on school days from KIPP DC College Prep to Anacostia station leaving at 4:10 pm. Those trips operate along Brentwood Parkway, Mount Olivet Road, Montello Avenue, and K Street before resuming its regular route along 8th Street going to Anacostia. Additional weekday peak-hour route 92 trips operate between Congress Heights and Eastern Market station only in order to reduce crowding. Routes 90 and 92 currently operate out of Shepherd Parkway garage. History The U Street‚ÄìGarfield Line originally operated under the Capital Traction Company which operated under streetcars in the late 1800s. Route 92 operated under the Good Hope Line while 90 operated on a combination of the New Jersey Avenue, U Street, and Florida Avenue/8th Street lines. Both route 90 and 92 operated between Southeast DC and Duke Ellington Bridge via the Calvert Street Loop, Barney Circle, and Washington Union Station mainly along 8th Street, Florida Avenue, and U Street. The line would later be extended to McLean Gardens. The U Street portion would be electrified in 1892 while the Florida Avenue/8th Street portion would be electrified in 1908. Eventually, the Good Hope Line was converted into buses on January 26, 1925 while route 90 remained operating under streetcars when the Capital Traction Company and Washington Railway & Electric Company merged and formed the Capital Transit Company. Later routes 90 and 92 were acquired by DC Transit in 1956 and converted into buses on January 28, 1962 when streetcars were shut down. Routes 90 and 92 would be acquired by WMATA on January 4, 1973. In later years, new routes 91 and 93 were introduced as the Garfield-Owl Line to provide late night service to routes 90 and 92 from McLean Gardens and Shipley Terrace. 1991 Changes On December 28, 1991 when Anacostia station opened, route 90 was rerouted to operate to the new station while also replacing the Stanton Road Line (94) portion between Anacostia and McLean Gardens when route 94 was shorten to terminate at Anacostia station. 1996 Changes On December 29, 1996, short route 90 trip operating between Duke Ellington Bridge and McLean Gardens during early morning and late night hours, was replaced during the weekdays, Saturdays, and Sundays by an equal number of route 93 trips which will be extended from Duke Ellington Bridge to McLean Gardens over the same routing. 2001 Changes On January 13, 2001, route 92 was extended from its Garfield terminus to the newly opened Congress Heights station replacing all route 91 service. Loop service via 15th and Congress Place, SE, was also discontinued. Route 93 was also shifted to the U Street‚ÄìGarfield Line and being extended from Shipley Terrace to Congress Heights station alongside the 92. Service was be discontinued south of Alabama Avenue (Trenton Place, 19th Street and Savannah Street). 2007 Changes On June 24, 2007. routes 90, 92, and 93 were shorten from McLean Gardens to Duke Ellington Bridge in order to improve on time efficiency from the long routes the buses run along. Select rush hour buses would still end at 14th and U streets, NW however. Route 96 would replace the 90, 92, and 93 portion between McLean Gardens and Duke Ellington Bridge. 2011 Study Between 2010 and 2011, WMATA and the District Department of Transportation began a study on the U Street‚ÄìGarfield Line. Public meetings and surveys were contributed to passengers on how to improve the lines. Multiple passengers complained about the route being crowded, loud buses, buses behind schedule, low frequency, safety and security, shelters and stops, communication, and extending the western end of line up to Woodley Park station or McLean Gardens again. At the time of the study, routes 90, 92, and 93 were operating out of Southern Avenue division which utilizes Flxibles, D40LFRs, DE40LFAs, and Orion Vs. 2014 Changes On June 22, 2014, all route 94 trips were shorten from Duke Ellington Bridge to U and 14th Streets, NW terminus (U Street station) and all Route 92 southbound service begins at U & 13th Streets, NW (U Street station, 13th Street NW entrance). Service between U Street station and Duke Ellington Bridge is still provided by routes 90 and 93. 2015 Proposed Changes In 2015, WMATA proposed to eliminate all route 93 service due to low ridership along Stanton, Pomeroy, and Morris Roads and to simplify the line. Alternative service is provided by routes 90, 92, and 94. 2016 Changes On March 27, 2016, all route 93 service was discontinued and replaced by routes 90, 92, and 94 running on the same routing. Additional early morning and late evening 90 and 92 trips were added. 2018 Changes On June 24, 2018, additional route 92 trips were added to operate between Congress Heights station and Eastern Market station. 2020 Proposed changes In 2020, WMATA proposed to eliminate the 92 short trips between Congress Heights and Eastern Market stations as there is alternative service on each stop and at the request of the District Department of Transportation.

Supplementing the software was the Laplink Cable, also known as a null-printer cable, that allowed the connection of two computers via the parallel port or the serial port to establish a direct cable connection. The cable was introduced in 1986 with the LAPDOS software package. It allowed for faster data transfer between early PCs running MS-DOS and improved transfer rates over the traditional null modem serial cable. The INTERSVR program in MS-DOS 6.0 could also use a Laplink cable. The cable achieved broad adoption and was offered as standard equipment with popular portable computers of the day. Other products of note were Laplink Plus and Laplink for Mac. With the introduction of Microsoft Windows in the mid-1990s, Laplink for Windows gained popularity as a way to synchronize Windows PCs using the parallel port or serial port and the proprietary Laplink cable. 2003-2004: Acquisition and re-birth In 2003 Laplink was acquired by Thomas Koll, a former Microsoft Corporate Vice President, and re-organized as Laplink Software, Inc. The corporate office was moved from Bothell, Washington to Kirkland and subsequently to Bellevue. All employees remained with the entity. Under Koll‚Äôs leadership the company ventured into new innovation areas such as peer-to-peer networking and strengthened existing technologies with acquisitions and development investments. 2005-2014: PCmover becomes the standard for Windows migration Building on its expertise in file transfers and migration processes, Laplink introduced PCmover in 2005. This PC migration software was offered in a variety of versions that include the ability to move or restore all selected files, folders, settings, user profiles, and programs from an old PC to a new one, an old operating system to a new one, or an old hard drive to a new one. In 2006, Laplink was recognized as a Microsoft Certified Gold Partner. In 2009, PCmover Upgrade Assistant was introduced and gave users a simple method for in-place upgrades from Windows XP and Windows Vista to Windows 7. Microsoft did not provide this functionality in Windows 7 and instead recommended PCmover. PCmover also supported migration from a Windows Me machine to a news Windows 7 machine. The product was available in two variations: PCmover Home for individuals and PCmover Enterprise, allowing IT professionals to transfer selected applications, settings, data, and user accounts to a new PC. The pattern of Laplink providing upgrade functionality not offered by Microsoft continued over the years with Microsoft going so far as to recommend the use of PCmover when migrating from one operating system version to the next. In March 2014, Laplink partnered with Microsoft to offer Windows XP users a free data migration tool to move from a Windows XP computer to a Windows 7, 8, or 8.1 computer. 2015-Present: Focus shifts to the enterprise Due to Microsoft's deprecation of Windows Easy Transfer with the launch of Windows 10, the partnership with Microsoft was expanded to support the move to Windows 10. Laplink made PCmover free of charge for personal and increased focus on the migration needs of large enterprises. The enterprise version of PCmover was able to handle large scale migrations of more than 100,000 systems. A new version of PCmover Enterprise introduced in 2019 featured a refreshed user interface and included a profile migrator tool for transferring files and setting between user profiles on the same PC. With Microsoft about to end support for Windows 7, in January 2020 the company released a Windows 7 Migration Kit for both home and business users. The kit included PCmover Professional, SafeErase, a program for securely wiping the old hard drive, and DiskImage for making backups. In June 2020, the company offered Active Directory support for PCmover Enterprise to allow local Active Directory profiles to be migrated to Azure Active Directory. This migration was not supported by Microsoft.  Reception  Laplink's PCmover software has been reviewed by a variety of publications around the world. PC & Tech Authority stated it was impressed with the software because none of their files were missing and all of their applications worked right away. PC World said that the pros of PCmover are that the software migrates data and applications, and that it includes a data transfer cable. The cons are that it doesn't handle complex migrations gracefully and has unclear instructions. Barron's gave PCmover Professional 5 stars for its ability to make moving from an old computer to a new one quick and easy.Windows Report called PCmover the best tool for moving from Windows 7 to Windows 10. In a hands-on review of Laplink DiskImage, The Digital Guyde called the product a lifesaver that could save a lot time and headaches.

The name originates from the fact that the forest contains the headwaters of East Fork of the French Broad River. The North Carolina Forest Service primarily manages the forest for water and soil quality, as well as protecting rare species; however, primitive recreational uses are permitted. History The forest was established in 2009 when Congressman Charles H. Taylor agreed to sell about to the state, which was one of the largest remaining tracts of privately held land in Western North Carolina. Over the next 9 years, The Conservation Fund and Conserving Carolina assisted with the acquisition, by purchasing portions of the property as grants became available, then turning them over to the North Carolina Forest Service. A small, portion of the property around the summit of Sassafras Mountain was given to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources for development of an observation tower at South Carolina's highest point. On September 8, 2018, the beginning of deer season, Headwaters State Forest was opened to the public. Recreation The forest is open to hiking, hunting and fishing. Mountain biking, horse back riding and off- roading are not permitted. The NC Forest Service plans on maintaining the forest in a primitive, undeveloped state with few visitor facilities. A spur of the Foothills Trail follows along the southern boundary of the forest, connecting Sassafras Mountain to Caesars Head State Park (SC). There are several waterfalls in the forest, including East Fork Falls, Reece Place Falls and Graveley Falls. Bursted Rock is regarded as the most scenic vantage point in the forest.

It uses statistical tools to determine if observed election results differ from normally occurring patterns. These tools can be relatively simple, such as looking at the frequency of integers and using Benford's law, or can be more complex and involve machine learning techniques. Method Election forensics can use various approaches. Some approaches include looking at data distribution, particularly voter turnout, to look for outliers. Other approaches can include comparing the observed distribution of the digits themselves to typical digit distributions (Benford's law). Other signs of fraud are overrepresentation of round numbers rather than those with decimals, or overabundance of numbers that are a multiple of 5 (e.g. 50%, 70%, 75%). More recent and statistically advanced approaches use machine learning, as machine learning can incorporate a large volume of data and use several different statistical models instead of a single one. Application Between 1978 and 2004, a 2010 review concluded that 61% of elections examined from more than 170 countries showed some signs of election fraud, with major fraud in 27% of all examined elections. Since the early 2000s, election forensics has been used to examine the integrity of elections in various countries, including Afghanistan, Albania, Argentina, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Kenya, Libya, South Africa, Uganda, and Venezuela. Compared to other methods Relative to other methods of monitoring election security, such as in-person monitoring of polling places and parallel vote tabulation, election forensics has advantages and disadvantages. Election forensics is considered advantageous in that data is objective, rather than subject to interpretation. It also allows votes from all contests and localities to be systematically analyzed, with statistical conclusions about the likelihood of fraud. Disadvantages of election forensics include its inability to actually detect fraud, just data anomalies that may or may not be indicative of such. This can be addressed by combining election forensics with in-person monitoring. Another disadvantage is its complexity, requiring advanced knowledge of statistics and significant computing power. Additionally, the best results require a high level of detail, ideally comprehensive data from the polling place regarding voter turnout, vote counts for all issues and candidates, and valid ballots.

It was sold by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company and is numbered 1014‚Äì1017 in its catalogues. A fragment of the film survives. Plot M√©li√®s's American catalogue reports the following action, covering the part of the film now presumed lost: A painter is working on a full-length portrait of a woman in exoticized dress, with help from a bottle of whiskey. Suddenly he realizes that, whenever he puts the bottle down, his servant is also stealing a taste. The painter goes to hide the whiskey bottle, and the servant seizes the opportunity to drink the whole contents of two other bottles. The painter returns just as the servant's stomachaches make him realize that these two bottles contained not whiskey, but paint. The angry painter thrashes the servant, finally hitting him with a saber. The servant falls unconscious. The painter, thinking he has accidentally murdered his servant, hurriedly stuffs the body in a nearby trunk and drinks himself asleep. When the painter is sleeping in his drunken stupor, the servant sneaks out of the trunk, just as the woman comes to life and steps out of her painting. She plays a series of pranks on the servant, culminating in pouring a bucket of white liquid over his head. The surviving fragment of the film shows the woman returning to her frame and becoming a painting again. The painter wakes up and is astonished to see the servant swatting the painting with the broom. The painter gives the servant a second thrashing. The fragment concludes with action not mentioned in the catalogue: the painter finally decapitates his servant, stuffing the head and body in the same trunk he had used before. The servant's body, holding its head, climbs out of the box and wanders away. The painter, terrified at the sight, jumps straight into his painting and disappears. Production and themes M√©li√®s and a frequent collaborator, an actor billed as Manuel, play the master (Ali Barbouyou) and servant (Ali Bouf-√†-l'huile) respectively. The film's special effects are worked with substitution splices and dissolves. The scenery, particularly detailed even by M√©li√®s's elaborate standards, includes a large picture frame M√©li√®s had previously used in other films, including The Mysterious Portrait. A Centre national de la cin√©matographie guide to M√©li√®s's work notes that, while the final jump into the painting is very M√©li√®sian in style, this is one of M√©li√®s's few films in which a magic disappearance is not followed by a final return suggesting a curtain call. Other examples without a final reappearance include Bob Kick, the Mischievous Kid (1903), The Marvellous Wreath (1903), and Satan in Prison (1907), assuming the endings of those films are complete in their surviving prints.

His rule saw economic growth, continuing development of Ibadi theology and the reorganisation of the military. Although opposition grew to his attempts to strengthen the imam's authority, he refused to leave power and swiftly dealt with challenges to his rule.  Biography  Al-Muhanna bin Jayfar was elected as imam by the Ibadi ulama on 29 April 840/3 Rajab 226 AH, the same day as the death of his predecessor Abd al-Malik bin Humayd. He hailed from the Yahmad clan of Azd and may have a relative of the fourth imam, Ghassan bin Abdullah.al-Rawas 1990, p. 242. His tendency to expose his teeth when angered earned him the nickname 'Dh≈´ ‚Äôl-NƒÅb' (possessor of the eyetooth).Hoffman 2012, p. 307. Al-Muhanna possessed a stern disposition, and his reign was characterised by increasingly centralised governance and strict disciplinary measures, especially towards his critics and those deemed to be a threat to the imamate.al-Rawas 1990, pp. 242-243. His desire to maintain order led him to reorganise the military: the navy expanded to 300 warships, and the irregular militias known as the shurat were replaced with a standing army headquartered at Nizwa, comprised from 10,000 soldiers and up to 9,000 horses and camels.al-Salmi 2001, p. 65.al-Rawas 1990, pp. 244-245. In addition, agricultural output was improved due to works undertaken on the aflaj irrigation systems. The resultant stability and increase in commerce fostered population growth, with one district of Nizwa housing up to 14,000 inhabitants during his rule.al-Rawas 1990, p. 245.  Opposition  Al-Muthanna's disregard for the traditional power structure of the imamate, where power was shared with the ulama, earned him opposition from their ranks. His approach to governance alienated the prominent scholars Bashir bin al-Mundhir and Muhammad bin Mahbub, who secretly renounced him. Several such malcontents convinced Musa bin Ali, the most influential scholar on the ahl al-hall wal-aqd, to dismiss al-Muhanna from office. Although Musa met with al-Muhanna intending to remove him from power, the latter refused and told him that no imam would rule for more than a year if popular opinion reigned supreme.al-Salmi 2001, p. 65.al-Rawas, p. 245. Sometime during al-Muhanna's rule, the tribes of Mahrah refused to continue paying the zakat tax to the imamate. In particular, a Mahri individual named Wasim bin Jayfar refused to pay his due when confronted by one of al-Muhanna's tax collectors and threatened him. When word of this reached al-Muthanna, he sent three armed units under the command of the governors of Sinaw, Adam and Ja'lan to take the Mahri chief captive. During this expedition, Wasim was captured and imprisoned in Nizwa. He remained there for one year until Mahri sheikhs secured his release through the intercession of al-Muthanna's clan, Yahmad. Al-Muhanna offered Wasim's release in exchange for the tribes bringing camels to Nizwa annually, which they agreed to.al- Rawas 1990, p. 248. The most serious challenge to al-Muthanna's power was posed by the tribe of Banu al-Julanda, who held power in Oman until 702.al- Salmi 2001, p. 32-33. Led by a certain al-Mughirah bin Raswan, Julandani rebels marched on Tawam where they defeated and killed the local governor, Abu al-Waddah. In response, al-Muthanna dispatched two armies to the region, one led by Abu Marwan, the governor of Sohar. His force included an Indian component whose chief was al-Mattar al-Hindi, although it is unclear whether they were mercenaries or professional soldiers. The armies scored decisive victories over the Julandanis and carried out a series of reprisals under the influence of al-Mattar's men: the Banu al-Julanda were massacred, their settlements razed, and their families forced to starve in the desert. Their conduct was later described as 'foolish' and Al-Muhanna recompensed those who lost their homes.al-Rawas 1990, pp. 246-247.  Development of Ibadi theology  The controversy of Quranic createdness reached Oman during al-Muhanna's rule and became a source of contention within the Ibadi community.al-Salmi 2001, p. 24. A debate took place between Ibadi scholars Muhammad bin Mahbub and Muhammad bin Hisham on the subject; the former argued that the Quran was created by Allah, while the latter argued against the doctrine and threatened to leave Oman if it continued to spread. Ibadi scholars convened to discuss the issue, and by the end of the meeting Muhammad bin Mahbub retracted his views on the matter. Fearful of a schism within the Ibadi community, the scholars requested al-Muhanna to forbid anyone from saying that Quran was created, to which he complied.al-Rawas 1990, pp. 249-250. Al-Muhanna himself was active in clarifying and developing Ibadi doctrine. A siyar he authored, addressed to a certain Mu'adh bin Harb, expresses his views on issues of Ibadi theology and fiqh, including predestination, the shortening of prayers when travelling and the rejection of anthropomorphism in relation to Allah.al-Salmi 2001, pp. 21-22. In his discussion of predestination, he states that destiny and human actions originate from Allah's knowledge, predicated on the view that Allah's knowledge and determination of human actions are inseparable.al- Salmi 2001, p. 55. In addition, he equates sin to disbelief (kufr), classifying it into two categories: disbelief through the rejection of revelation, and disbelief in the revelation through disobedience to it.al- Salmi 2001, p. 58,  Death and legacy  Al-Muhanna died on 15 October 851/16 Rabi al-Thani 237 AH. He was succeeded as imam by Al-Salt bin Malik on the same day. In July 2017, a mosque named after al-Muhanna was opened in Oman's Barka wilayah.

A year later, in 1934, a state of war was declared leading to the disbanding of the Palma Town Hall and dismissal of the Mayor of Palma, Emili Darder. During his term, he banned the Himno de Riesgo from being played.  Civil War  During the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Garc√≠a Ruiz was an engineer officer with the rank of lieutenant. On the 19th of July, General Manuel Goded appointed him to the rank of civil governor. The immediate measures that were taken included the repression of the Spanish General Strike, the removal of administrative fees received by municipalities, the dismissal of disloyal civil servants and the closure of unions and parties. Within 24 hours new town mayors were appointed under the condition that they remained apolitical. These measures led to his encounter with Mallorca's military commander, Colonel Aurelio D√≠as de Freijo. Together with other military leaders and against the advice of Aurelio D√≠as de Freijo, he imprisoned Carlos Soto Romero, an emissary sent from the Generalitat de Catalunya. On the evening of 30 August 1936, military leaders in Mallorca appointed him as head of operations and troop commander in Manacor, relieving Emilio Ramos Unamuno from his duties. In the process, his role as Civil Governor was handed over to Antonio √Ålvarez-Ossorio, the head of the Civil Guard. In September, he temporarily took over command as Captain General for the Balearic Islands. Shortly after, he was promoted to Colonel and was assigned to mainland Spain as the Engineering commander. He campaigned across the north of Spain, from √Ålava to Gij√≥n and Avil√©s. At Bilbao, he was awarded the city's gold medal. Following the campaign, he was appointed as commander general for Engineering and moved to the south of the country, under direct orders from general Gonzalo Queipo de Llano.  Honours  On 21 December 1936, the Manacor town council named Luis Garc√≠a Ruiz as the town's adopted son. Following the end of the civil war, he was promoted to general based on his performance, ranking 8th. On 9 May 1939, his services led the city council of Palma to name him the adopted son of the island of Mallorca. From August 1940 to March 1942, he was the military governor for Mallorca. After the war, he joined the Balearic Chess Federation and chaired the Mallorcan Chess Club. In 1979, the Palma City Council dedicated the Porta des Camp plaza to him. On 4 May 2009, the Manacor town hall decided to withdraw Garc√≠a Ruiz's and Franco's titles as adopted sons.

Early involvement, 1965-1968 Kissinger's involvement in Indochina started prior to his appointment as National Security Adviser to Nixon. While still at Harvard, he had worked as a consultant on foreign policy to both the White House and State Department. Kissinger says that \\"In August 1965 ... [Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.], an old friend serving as Ambassador to Saigon, had asked me to visit Vietnam as his consultant. I toured Vietnam first for two weeks in October and November 1965, again for about ten days in July 1966, and a third time for a few days in October 1966 ... Lodge gave me a free hand to look into any subject of my choice\\". He became convinced of the meaninglessness of military victories in Vietnam, \\"... unless they brought about a political reality that could survive our ultimate withdrawal\\". Lodge allowed Kissinger to go anywhere he wanted, and to meet the ruling duumvirate of Air Marshal Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥ and General Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu. In a gaffe, Kissinger spoke frankly to an American reporter, Jack Foisie, who had arrived late to the press conference and was not aware that the press conference was \\"off-the-record\\". Kissinger called both Air Marshal K·ª≥ and General Thi·ªáu immature men of low intelligence, remarks that Foise published and which drew the ire of President Lyndon B. Johnson. In November 1965, when asked to comment by Time after the number of Americans killed in Vietnam passed 1, 000, Kissinger praised Johnson for having to make \\"difficult and lonely decisions\\". Kissinger compared Johnson to the sheriff played by Gary Cooper in the 1952 film High Noon, depicting Johnson as a heroic figure making necessary, but unpopular decisions. In a 1967 peace initiative, he would mediate between Washington and Hanoi. In June 1967 at an academic conference in Paris, Kissinger met a French biologist, Herbert Marcovitch, who mentioned that one of his friends was Raymond Aubrac, a Communist hero of the French resistance, who in turn was one of the few Westerners who were friends with Ho Chi Minh. When Ho went to Paris in 1946 in an attempt to negotiate Vietnamese independence from France, he had lived in Aubrac's house for several months and still had warm memories of him and his family. Ho had something of an aversion to Westerners and tried to avoid meeting them as much as possible, and Aubrac was unique in being allowed to correspond with Ho. Wanting to play a role in diplomacy, instead of just writing about it, Kissinger contacted the State Department with a plan for Marovitch and Aubrac to go to Hanoi with an peace offer. The Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, was opposed to Kissinger's plan, saying \\"Eight months pregnant with peace and all of them hoping to win the Nobel Peace Prize\\". However, W. Averell Harriman of the \\"peace shop\\" was interested and got President Johnson to approve the approach, which was code-named Operation Pennsylvania. In July 1967, Aubrac and Marcovitch went to Hanoi to see Ho, who told him that he was willing to open peace talks with the United States, provided that the Americans \\"unconditionally\\" stopped bombing North Vietnam. Before Ho had insisted that the United States had to \\"unconditionally and finally\\" stop the bombing, and this slight chance in phrasing was seen as a hopeful sign. Harriman sent his deputy, Chester Cooper, to join Kissinger in the unofficial peace talks in Paris, which seemed promising. However, Aubrac stated that Ho had wanted the United States to cease bombing North Vietnam for a short period of time as a sign of good faith, but the National Security Adviser, W.W. Rostow, persuaded Johnson to increase the bombing of North Vietnam at the same time. On 22 August 1967 Aubrac and Marcovitch were refused visas to visit North Vietnam as the inability of Kissinger to achieve the promised bombing pause had disillusioned Ho. In August 1968, Kissinger wrote to Harriman, who was leading the American delegation at the Paris peace talks: \\"My dear Averell...I am through with Republican politics. The party is hopeless and unfit to govern\\". On 17 September 1968, Kissinger arrived in Paris and served as an unofficial consultant to the American delegation. At the time, Kissinger spoke of his disgust with the Republican candidate, Richard Nixon, saying: \\"Three days of the week I think I'll vote for Hubert. The other days I think I won't vote at all\\". But at the same time, Kissinger was in contact with the Nixon campaign and began to share information about the progress of the peace talks. Kissinger began to call Richard Allen, Nixon's foreign policy adviser, from a public telephone booth, offering information in exchange for which he wanted a senior position if Nixon won the election. On 12 October 1968, Kissinger told Allen that Harriman had \\"broken open the champagne\\" because he persuaded Johnson to order a bombing halt of North Vietnam. Allen called John Mitchell, Nixon's campaign manager, who agreed that this was most important information. As a reward, Mitchell told Allen that Kissinger would receive a senior post he craved, with Allen saying the office of National Security Adviser would suit Kissinger the best. At the same time, Kissinger in contact with the Democratic candidate, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, lobbying for a senior post if Humphrey won the election. Kissinger had served as the foreign policy adviser to the Republican Governor of New York, Nelson Rockefeller, during his failed bids to win the Republican nomination in the elections of 1960, 1964 and 1968. He had a low opinion of Nixon during this time, speaking of his \\"shallowness\\" and of his \\"dangerous misunderstanding\\" of foreign policy. Many were surprised when Kissinger accepted Nixon's offer to serve as his National Security Adviser. Nixon said of Kissinger: \\"I don't trust Henry, but I can use him\\". Arrival in Washington, 1969 Nixon had been elected in 1968 on the promise of achieving \\"peace with honor\\" and ending the Vietnam War. By promising to continue the peace talks which Johnson began in May 1968 in Paris, Nixon admitted that he had ruled out \\"a military victory\\" in Vietnam. Nixon wanted a diplomatic settlement similar to the armistice of Panmunjom that ended the Korean War and frequently stated in private he had no intention of being \\"the first president of the United States to lose a war\\". To force the North Vietnamese to sign an armistice, Nixon favored a two-pronged approach of the \\"madman theory\\" of seeking to act rashly to intimidate the North Vietnamese while at the same time trying using the strategy of \\"linkage\\" to improve relations with the Soviet Union and China in order to persuade both these nations to stop sending arms to North Vietnam. In office, Nixon implemented a policy of Vietnamization that aimed to gradually withdraw U.S. troops while expanding the combat role of the South Vietnamese Army so that it would be capable of independently defending its government against the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam, a Communist guerrilla organization, and the North Vietnamese army (Vietnam People's Army or PAVN). Kissinger was opposed Vietnamization. In an article published in Foreign Affairs in January 1969, Kissinger criticized General William Westmoreland's attrition strategy because the Vietnamese Communists were willing to accept far higher losses on the battlefield than the United States and could therefore \\"win\\" as long as they did not \\"lose\\" by merely keeping the war going. In the same article, he argued that losses endured by the Vietnamese Communists in the Tet Offensive were meaningless as the Tet Offensive had turned American public opinion against the war, ruling out the possibility of a military solution, and the best that could be done now was to negotiate the most favorable peace settlement at the Paris peace talks. Kissinger, when he came into office in 1969 favored a negotiating strategy under which the United States and North Vietnam would sign an armistice and agreed to pull their troops out of South Vietnam while the South Vietnamese government and the Viet Cong were to agree to a coalition government. Kissinger had doubts about Nixon's theory of \\"linkage\\", believing that this would give the Soviet Union leverage over the United States and unlike Nixon was less concerned about the ultimate fate of South Vietnam. One of Kissinger's first acts as National Security Adviser in early 1969 was to seek opinions of the Vietnam experts within the CIA, the military and the State Department. The lengthy volume that emerged contained a diverse collection of opinions with some stating the South Vietnamese were making \\"rapid strides\\" while others doubted that the government in Saigon would \\"ever constitute an effective political or military counter to the Vietcong\\". The \\"bulls\\" estimated that American troops would need to fight on in Vietnam for 8.3 years before the South Vietnamese would be able to fight on their own while the \\"bears\\" estimated it take 13.4 years of American troops fighting in Vietnam before the South Vietnamese would be able to fight on their own. Kissinger passed the volume on to Nixon with the comment that there was no consensus within the expert community with the implied conclusion that he should be free on his own without consulting the experts. On 17 February 1969, Nixon the told the Soviet ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin that all matters of substance were to be go through Kissinger rather than the Secretary of State William Rogers. Shortly afterwards, Kissinger met with Dobrynin to tell him that Nixon would not accept any settlement that looked like a defeat nor he want any change in the regime in Saigon, through \\"evolution\\" of the Saigon regime was acceptable. Dobrynin, who served in Washington for many years had a favorable impression of Kissinger, who was not dogmatic and rigid like his predecessor W.W. Rostow nor dull and unimaginative like Dean Rusk. Kissinger then set up about undermining Henry Cabot Lodge Jr, the head of the American peace delegation in Paris, as he asked Dobrynin to set up a secret meeting in Paris between him and Le Duc Tho, the most important member of the North Vietnamese delegation in Paris. On 22 February 1969, the Viet Cong launched an offensive in South Vietnam, which Kissinger called \\"an act of extraordinary cynicism\\". Nixon, on a trip to Europe, took the offensive as a personal insult and wanted to bomb Cambodia in retaliation. Kissinger persuaded Nixon to wait until his European trip was over. Adding pressure was the claim by General Creighton Abrams, the commander of the American forces in South Vietnam, that his officers had finally found the Central Office for South Vietnam (COSVN), the headquarters that supposedly controlled the Viet Cong just over the border in Cambodia. The Americans had searched for years to find the COSVN. At a meeting in Washington attended by Kissinger, two colonels sent by Abrams shown the supposed location of the COSVN in an area of Cambodia the Americans called the Fishhook and requested a bombing strike by B-52 bombers to wipe it out. In early 1969, Kissinger was opposed to the plans for Operation Menu, the bombing of Cambodia, fearing that Nixon was acting rashly with no plans for the diplomatic fall-out, but on 16 March 1969 Nixon at a meeting at the White House attended by Kissinger announced the bombing would start the next day. As Congress was unlikely to grant approval to bombing Cambodia, Nixon decided to go ahead without Congressional approval and keep the bombings secret, a decision that several constitutional law experts argued was illegal. On 17 March 1969, B-52 bombers started to bomb the supposed location of the COSVN in an operation code-named Breakfast that Kissinger stated later that he found to be in bad taste. Through Kissinger had initially opposed Operation Menu, he started to champion the bombing as Nixon's chief of staff, H.R Hlademan wrote in his diary he \\"came beaming in with the report [of the bombings], very productive\\". As part of the \\"linkage\\" concept, Kissinger in March 1969 sent Cyrus Vance to Moscow with the message that if the Soviet Union pressured North Vietnam into a diplomatic settlement favorable to the United States, the reward would be concessions on the talks on limiting the nuclear arms race. At the same time, Kissinger met with Dobrynin to warn him that Nixon was a dangerous man who wanted to escalate the Vietnam war. In April 1969, North Korea shot down a U.S. Navy plane on a spy mission, killing 31 airmen. Kissinger wanted to bomb a North Korean air base in retaliation, being opposed by the Defense Secretary Melvin Laird, the Secretary of State William Rogers and General Earle Wheeler, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, who warned that to bomb North Korea might start a second war in Asia. Kissinger argued that bombing North Korea would help end the Vietnam war, saying: \\"Hanoi might say, 'This guy [Nixon] is becoming irrational'-and we'd better settle with him\\". Unable to gain support at the National Security Council, Kissinger appealed to Nixon's Domestic Affair Adviser, John Ehrlichman, saying that through striking North Korea might cause a second Korean war that it might also help with the Vietnam war. When Ehrlichman asked Kissinger how far things might escalate if the U.S bombed North Korea, he was told: \\"Well, it could go nuclear\\". Ehrlichman came away convinced that Kissinger with his thick German accent, academic titles, advocacy of a ruthless foreign policy and a role as a senior presidential adviser seemed too much like the eponymous character of the 1964 black comedy Dr. Strangelove and advised Nixon not to strike North Korea, advice that was accepted. Starting in April 1969, Kissinger pressed for a plan code-named Operation Duck Hook that see the United States return to bombing North Vietnam and possibly use nuclear weapons. Nixon and Kissinger played a \\"good cop-bad cop\\" routine with Dobrynin with Nixon acting the part of the petulant president at the end of his patience with North Vietnam while Kissinger acted as the reasonable diplomat anxious to improve relations with the Soviet Union, saying to Dobrynin in May 1969 that Nixon would \\"escalate the war\\" if the Soviet Union \\"didn't produce a settlement\\" in Vietnam. At another meeting in 1969, Kissinger warned Dobrynin that \\"the train has just left the station and is now headed down the track\\", saying the Soviet Union better start pressuring North Vietnam now before Nixon did something truly reckless and dangerous. The attempt at \\"linkage\\" failed as the Soviet Union did not pressure North Vietnam and instead Dobrynin told Kissinger that the Soviets wanted better relations with the United States regardless of the Vietnam war. After the failure of the \\"linkage\\" attempt, Nixon became more open to the alternative strategy suggested by the Defense Secretary Melvin Laird who argued that the burden of the war should be shifted to the South Vietnamese, which was initially called \\"de-Americanization\\" and which Laird renamed Vietnamization because it sounded better. In May 1969, the bombing of Cambodia was leaked to William M. Beecher of the New York Times who published an article about it, which infuriated Kissinger. At the time, Kissinger told the FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, \\"we will destroy whoever did this\\". As a result, the phones of 13 members of Kissinger's staff were taped by the FBI without a warrant. Nixon considered Kissinger to be \\"obsessive and paranoid\\" and was annoyed with his endless in-fighting with Laird and Rogers. Kissinger accused Laird of leaking the news of Operation Menu, saying in a phone call: \\"You son of bitch, I know you leaked that story and you're going to have to explain it to the president\\". At the time, Kissinger portrayed himself to his friends at Harvard as a moderating force who was working to remove the United States from Vietnam, saying he did not want to end up like his predecessor W.W. Rostow, whose actions as National Security Adviser had caused him to be ostracized by the liberal American intelligentsia. In June 1969, the former Defense Secretary Clark Clifford published an article in Foreign Affairs calling for the withdraw of 100, 000 U.S. troops from Vietnam by the end of 1969 and all by the end of 1970. Influenced by Laird, Nixon announced the immediate withdraw of 25, 000 U.S. troops from Vietnam, saying: \\"I would hope that we could beat Mr. Clifford's timetable, just as I think we're done a little better than he did when he was in charge of our national defense\\". Kissinger was opposed to the withdraw, which he predicated would mean the immediate collapse of South Vietnam. On 4 August 1969, Kissinger met secretly with Xu√¢n Th·ªßy at the Paris apartment of Jean Sainteny to discuss peace. Sainteny was a former French colonial official sympathetic to Vietnamese nationalism who had offered to serve as an honest broker. Kissinger had been hoping to see Tho rather Thuy. Kissinger repeated the American offer of \\"mutual withdrawal\\" of U.S and North Vietnamese forces from South Vietnam which Th·ªßy rejected while Th·ªßy demanded a new government in Saigon which Kissinger rejected. Kissinger had a low opinion of North Vietnam, saying \\"I can't believe that a fourth-rate power like North Vietnam doesn't have a breaking point\\". Kissinger was opposed to the strategy of Vietnamization, expressing some doubt about the ability of the ARVN (Army of the Republic of Vietnam-i.e. the South Vietnamese Army) to hold the field, causing much tension with Defense Secretary Laird who was deeply committed to Vietnamization. In September 1969, Kissinger in a memo advised Nixon against \\"de-escalation\\", saying that keeping U.S troops fighting in Vietnam \\"remains one of our few bargaining weapons\\". In the same memo, Kissinger stated he was \\"deeply disturbed\\" that Nixon had started pulling out U.S. troops, saying that withdrawing the troops was like \\"salted peanuts\\" to the American people, \\"the more U.S troops come home, the more will be demanded\\", giving the advantage to the enemy who merely had to \\"wait us out\\". Instead, he recommenced that the United States resume bombing North Vietnam and mine the coast. Later in September 1969, Kissinger proposed a plan for what he called a \\"savage, punishing\\" blow against North Vietnam code-named Duck Hook to Nixon, arguing that this was the best way to force North Vietnam to agree to peace on American terms. Laird was strongly opposed to Duck Hook, warning Nixon that the use of nuclear weapons to kill a massive number of North Vietnamese civilians would alienate American public opinion from the administration and persuaded Nixon to reject it. Reflecting his background as a Harvard professor of political science who belonged to the Primat der Aussenpolitik school which saw foreign policy as belonging only to a small elite, Kissinger was less sensitive to public opinion than Laird, a former Republican congressman who constantly advised Nixon to keep American public opinion in mind. Laird used the National Moratorium protests of 15 November 1969 to persuade Nixon to cancel Duck Hook, arguing that if the war as it was had caused the largest demonstrations ever in American history, then Kissinger's plans for Duck Hook would alienate public even more. The Cambodian controversy, 1969-1970 Kissinger played a key role in bombing Cambodia to disrupt PAVN and Viet Cong units launching raids into South Vietnam from within Cambodia's borders and resupplying their forces by using the Ho Chi Minh trail and other routes, as well as the 1970 Cambodian Incursion and subsequent widespread bombing of Khmer Rouge targets in Cambodia. The Paris peace talks had become stalemated by late 1969 owing to the obstructionism of the South Vietnamese delegation who wanted the talks to fail. The South Vietnamese President Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu did not want the United States to withdraw from Vietnam, and out of frustration with him, Kissinger decided to begin secret peace talks in Paris parallel to the official talks that the South Vietnamese were unaware of. On 21 February 1970, in a modest house in a Paris suburb, Kissinger secretly met L√™ ƒê·ª©c Th·ªç, the North Vietnamese diplomat who was to become his most tenacious adversary. In 1981, Kissinger told the journalist Stanley Karnow: \\"I don't look back on our meetings with any great joy, yet he was a person of substance and discipline who defended the position he represented with dedication\\". Not until February 1971 were Rogers and Laird first informed of the parallel peace talks in Paris. Kissinger was to meet Tho three times between February‚ÄìApril 1970, and the North Vietnamese first sensed a softening of the American position during these talks as Kissinger slightly altered the \\"mutual withdrawal formula\\" that the Americans had previously held to. Nixon was gravely disappointed that the secret talks in Paris did not have the prompt results he wanted. Kissinger wrote in his memoirs that \\"historians rarely do justice to the psychological stress on a policy-maker\\", noting that by early 1970 Nixon was feeling very much besieged and inclined to lash out against a world he was believed was plotting his downfall. Nixon had become obsessed with the film Patton, seeing how the film presented Patton as a solitary and misunderstood genius whom the world did not appreciate a parallel to himself and kept watching the film over and over again. In February 1970, several senators led by J. William Fulbright and Stu Symington first learned that the United States had been bombing Laos since December 1964, which led to complaints in Congress about the \\"secret war\\" in Laos. Nixon reluctantly decided to admit to the \\"secret war\\", and directed Kissinger to issue the necessary statement to the media. Kissinger's statement admitted to the bombing of Laos, but also claimed: \\"No American stationed in Laos has ever been killed in ground combat operations\\". Two days later, it emerged that a U.S. Army captain had been killed while fighting in Laos and subsequently the Pentagon admitted that in the period February 1969-February 1970 a total of 27 Americans had killed in Laos. Kissinger claimed that he had no lied, maintaining that all Americans killed in Laos were in \\"hot pursuit\\" when chasing the enemy from South Vietnam into Laos, but this argument made no impression. Nixon stated: \\"No one cares about B-52 strikes in Laos, but people worry about our boys out there\\". Nixon refused to see Kissinger for the next week, saying that his statement about Laos had caused him to drop 11 points in the public opinion polls. On 18 March 1970, the Prime Minister of Cambodia Lon Nol carried out a coup against King Sihanouk and ultimately declared Cambodia a republic. On 19 March 1970 Nixon in a note to Kissinger declared: \\"I want Helms [the CIA director] to develop and implement a plan for maximum assistance to pro-U.S. elements in Cambodia\\". Out of fury with Lon Nol, the king went to Beijing where he allied himself to his former enemies, the Khmer Rouge, calling upon the Khmer people to \\"liberate our motherland\\". As the most of the Khmer peasantry regarded the king as a god-like figure, the royal endorsement of the Khmer Rouge had immediate results. Cambodia had descended into chaos by late March 1970 as the Lon Nol regime, to prove its nationalist credibility, organized pogroms against the Vietnamese minority, leading the North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong to attack and defeat Cambodia's weak army. Nixon believed the situation in Cambodia offered the chance for him to be like Patton by doing something bold and risky. Kissinger was initially ambivalent about Nixon's plans to invade Cambodia, but as he saw the president was committed, he became more and more supportive. In early April 1970, Tho refused to see Kissinger anymore in Paris, saying there was nothing to discuss, which frustrated him. On 23 April 1970, Nixon in a memo to Kissinger declared, \\"we need a bold move in Cambodia to show that we stand with Lon Nol\\". Kissinger favored having the ARVN invade Cambodia with American air support. As Kissinger spoke with passion for the invasion, Nixon told Haldeman: \\"Kissinger is really having fun today. He's playing Bismarck\\". Kissinger for his part often mocked Nixon to his staff, calling him \\"the meatball mind\\" and \\"our drunken friend\\". When taking calls from Nixon, Laird, and Rogers, Kissinger would often play the phone calls on the intercom that allowed his aides to listen in while making funny faces that mocked those he was taking the calls from. When Kissinger was summoned to a meeting at the White House about Cambodia, he joked: \\"Our peerless leader has flipped out\\". On 26 April 1970, Nixon decided to \\"go for broke\\" by invading Cambodia with U.S troops, a decision that surprised Kissinger. Neither Laird nor Rogers had been invited to the meeting, which Kissinger to phone Laird under the grounds that the Defense Secretary should know that was being planned. Kissinger did not inform Rogers as he knew he was due to testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and was likely to face hostile questions from Fulbright. Kissinger wanted Rogers to truthfully say he was unaware of plans to invade Cambodia as otherwise he might be prosecuted for perjury. Kissinger also contacted two conservative Southern Democratic senators who had control of key committees, Senator Richard Russell and Senator John C. Stennis to inform of the planned invasion. Kissinger claimed that he appalled by the white supremacist views of Stennis and Russell, but that he admired them for their \\"integrity\\" and patriotism. When Nixon's speech-writer William Safire pointed out that the use of U.S. troops violated the Nixon Doctrine that America's Asian allies should do the fighting, Kissinger snapped at him: \\"We wrote the goddamn doctrine, we can change it!\\" Kissinger was under immense strain as several of his aides were planning to resign to protest the invasion of Cambodia, and his liberal friends from Harvard were pressuring him to resign as well while Nixon was all for more belligerence. Much of Kissinger's staff were deeply opposed to the invasion of Cambodia. When Kissinger asked one of his aides, William Watts, to be in charge of National Security Council staffing for the coming invasion. Watts refused, saying he was opposed to the invasion on moral grounds, causing Kissinger to shout: \\"Your views represent the cowardice of the Eastern Establishment!\\" Watts resigned on the spot. As Watts was writing his resignation letter, Kissinger's deputy, Alexander Haig, appeared to tell him on behalf of Kissinger: \\"You've just had an order from your commander in chief. You can't quit\\". Watts replied: \\"Fuck you Al! I just did\\". Kissinger received a phone call from Nixon and his best friend, Charles \\"Bebe\\" Rebozo, who both sounded very drunk; Nixon began the call and then handed the phone to Rebozo who said: \\"The President wants you to know if this doesn't work, Henry, it's your ass\\". On 30 April 1970, the United States invaded Cambodia which Nixon announced in a television address that Kissinger contemptuously called \\"vintage Nixon\\" because of his overblown rhetoric. At the time, Nixon was seen as recklessly escalating the war and in early May 1970 the largest protests ever against the Vietnam War took place. Four of Kissinger's aides resigned in protest while the Cambodian \\"incursion\\" ended several of Kissinger's friendships with colleagues from Harvard when he chose not to resign. Two of Kissinger's senior aides, Anthony Lake and Roger Morris, in a joint resignation letter stated they could not in good conscience continue to serve the administration. Nixon in his memoirs claimed that Kissinger \\"took a particularly hard line\\" with regards to the \\"Cambodian incursion\\". Roger Morris, one of Kissinger's aides later recalled that Kissinger was frightened by the huge antiwar demonstrations, comparing the antiwar movement to the Nazis. Kissinger was afraid to go home to his apartment, and instead lived in his office at the White House basement during the protests against the \\"Cambodian incursion\\". Kissinger was haunted by memories of his youth in Germany and had a deep distrust of mass movements of either the left or the right, favoring the Primat der Aussenpolitik school of foreign policy-making by an elite with the masses excluded. In his interview with Karnow, Kissinger maintained he felt torn about where he stood and blamed Nixon for his failure to find \\"the language of respect and compassion that might have created a bridge at least to the more reasonable elements of the antiwar movement\\". When several Harvard professors called on Kissinger to resign, he claimed: \\"If you only knew what I am staving off the right\\", claiming he was opposed to the invasion. After the resignations of Kissinger' aides, Nixon took away the authority to tap phones, which he had given Kissinger in May 1969, and gave it to the Attorney General, John Mitchell. Unknown to Kissinger, Mitchell had been illegally taping his phone since the fall of 1969. Adding to the tension, on 2 May 1970, U.S aircraft bombed North Vietnam for the first time since 1968, causing Senator Fulbright to say \\"Good God\\" when he the news while Senate Majority Leader, Mike Mansfield, said he had trouble believing that Nixon and Kissinger were so reckless. To Nixon, Kissinger accused Laird and/or Rogers of leaking the news of the bombing raid on North Vietnam and asked for the FBI to tap their phones. Without informing Nixon, on 4 May 1970 Laird announced the end of the bombing raids on North Vietnam. On the night of 8 May 1970, Nixon, who had been rattled by the protests, stayed up all night, drinking heavily and randomly phoning people he knew. Between 11:00 pm‚Äì2:00 am, Nixon made forty calls with Kissinger receiving 8 of the calls. The Cambodian \\"incursion\\" saw American and South Vietnamese take the areas of eastern Cambodia that American commanders called the Fish Hook and Parrot's Beak and captured an impressive haul of arms originating from China and the Soviet Union. But the majority of Vietnamese Communist forces had withdrawn deeper into Cambodia before the invasion with only a small number left behind to wage a fighting retreat to avoid charges of cowardice. Kissinger suggested another meeting with Tho in Paris, only to receive a note reading: \\"The U.S. words of peace are just empty ones\\". Kissinger's deputy, Haig, went to Phnom Penh to meet Lon Nol, who complained the invasion had not helped as it had only pushed the North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong deeper into Cambodia. In June 1970, the Americans pulled out of Cambodia and the Vietnamese Communists returned, through the loss of weapons greatly hindered their operations in the Saigon area for the rest of 1970. Having committed itself to supporting Lon Nol, the United States now had two allies instead of one to support in Southeast Asia. The bombing campaign in Cambodia contributed to the chaos of the Cambodian Civil War, which saw the forces of leader Lon Nol unable to retain foreign support to combat the growing Khmer Rouge insurgency that would overthrow him in 1975. Documents uncovered from the Soviet archives after 1991 reveal that the North Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1970 was launched at the explicit request of the Khmer Rouge and negotiated by Pol Pot's then second in command, Nuon Chea.Dmitry Mosyakov, \\"The Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese Communists: A History of Their Relations as Told in the Soviet Archives\\", in Susan E.

Henry Kissinger is not telling the truth about his past. Again. The Washington Post. Retrieved October 16, 2016. The Cambodian invasion further polarized an already deeply divided nation and the President's Commission on Campus Unrest headed by William Scranton in its report of September 1970 wrote the divisions in American society were \\"as deep as any since the Civil War\\". A number of Republican politicians complained to Nixon that his stance on Vietnam was hurting their chances for congressional elections in November 1970, leading the president to say to Kissinger it was natural that liberals like Senator George McGovern and Senator Mark Hatfield wanted to \\"bug out...But when the Right starts wanting to get out, for whatever reason, that's our problem\\". In an attempt to change Nixon's image, Kissinger and Nixon devised the notion of a \\"standstill cease- fire\\" where both sides would occupy whatever areas of South Vietnam they were holding at the time of the ceasefire, an offer that Nixon publicly made in a television address on 7 October 1970. In his speech, Nixon apparently moved way from the \\"mutual withdrawal formula\\" the North Vietnamese kept rejecting by not mentioning it, winning much acclaim, even from his opponents like McGovern and Hatfield (through he also said the withdraw of U.S. forces would be \\"based on principles\\" he had \\"previously\\" discussed, i.e. the \\"mutual withdrawal formula\\"). Kissinger and Nixon both disliked the idea of a \\"standstill ceasefire\\" as weakening South Vietnam, but fearing if Nixon continued on his present course, he would not be reelected in 1972, the offer was seen as worth the risk, especially since the North Vietnamese rejected it. In private, Kissinger called the \\"standstill ceasefire\\" offer as the means that \\"at a minimum...would give us from temporary relief from public pressures\\". Subsequently, Kissinger has maintained Nixon's offer of 7 October was sincere and the North Vietnamese made a major error in rejecting it. In late 1970, Kissinger met a Rand Corporation researcher, Daniel Ellsberg, who did some work for him early in the Nixon administration. As a Rand Corporation researcher, Ellsberg had access to a secret history of the Vietnam war that came to be known as the Pentagon Papers, and he asked Kissinger to read the study. Kissinger asked: \\"Do you really think we have anything to learn from that?\\" Ellsberg stated there was much to learn, leading Kissinger to say: \\"But you know, we make policy very differently now\\". Ellsberg stated: \\"Cambodia didn't look all that different\\". Kissinger replied: \\"You must understand, Cambodia was undertaken for very complicated reasons\\". Ellsberg in some exasperation shot back: \\"Henry, there hasn't been a rotten decision on Vietnam in the last ten years that wasn't undertaken for complicated reasons\\". Kissinger in an attempt to change the subject mentioned he hired a group of Harvard professors led by Thomas Schelling to serve as advisers, but they had all resigned in protest against the invasion of Cambodia, leading Kissinger to label them unpractical idealists who never knew nothing of power as he contemptuously noted \\"They never had the clearances\\". Ellsberg stated \\"I had the clearances\\", leading Kissinger say \\"I know that. I am not speaking of you\\". Pressing the point, Ellsberg noted \\"And Bundy and Rostow had the clearances. But their decisions weren't any better\\". Speaking of his predecessor, W.W. Rostow, Kissinger declared \\"Walt Rostow is a fool\\". Elllsberg replied: \\"That may be true. But McGeorge Bundy is no fool.\\" Kissinger accepted that point, saying \\"No, he is not fool. But McGeorge Bundy has no sense of policy\\". Diplomatic Maneuvers, 1971-1972 In late 1970, Nixon and Kissinger became concerned that the North Vietnamese would launch a major offensive in 1972 to coincide with presidential election, making it imperative to cut the Ho Chi Minh Trail in 1971 to prevent the Communists from building up their forces. As the Cooper‚ÄìChurch Amendment had forbidden U.S. troops from fighting in Laos, the plans that was conceived called for South Vietnamese troops with American air support to invade Laos to sever the Ho Chi Minh Trail in operation code-named Lam Son 719. Kissinger wrote about Lam Son \\"the operation, conceived in doubt and assailed by skepticism, proceeded in confusion\\". In the first major test of Vietnamization, the ARVN failed miserably. The ARVN invaded Laos on 8 February 1971 and were stopped decisively by the North Vietnamese. In March, Kissinger sent his deputy Haig to inspect the situation personally, leading him to report that the ARVN officers lacked courage and did not want to fight, making retreat the only option. The retreat when it began turned into a rout. Kissinger wrote Lam Son had fallen \\"far short of our expectations\\", which he blamed on bad American planning, poor South Vietnamese tactics and Nixon's leadership style, leading Karnow to write he blamed \\"everyone, characteristically, except himself\\". In early 1971, Kissinger clashed with Daniel Ellsberg when he arrived to give a lecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Ellsberg, an ardent hawk turned equally ardent dove asked Kissinger: \\"What is your best estimate of the numbers of Vietnamese who will be killed in the next twelve months as a consequence of your policy?\\" Kissinger commented that the question was clever in its wording, leading Ellsberg to say it was a basic matter of humanity. Kissinger asked \\"What other options are there?\\" Ellberg replied: \\"Can't you give us an answer?\\" Kissinger ended leaving the MIT without answering Ellsberg's question. In late May 1971, Kissinger returned to Paris to fruitlessly meet again with Tho. The North Vietnamese demand that Thi·ªáu step down proved to the main obstacle. Kissinger did not want a repeat of the prolonged bout of political instability that characterized South Vietnam from 1963 to 1967 and believed Thi·ªáu was a force for order. Tho suggested to Kissinger that Americans \\"stop supporting\\" Thi·ªáu who was running for the reelection in a ballot scheduled for 3 October 1971. Tho claimed that Thi·ªáu's opponents, Air Marshal Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥ and General D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh aka \\"Big Minh\\", were both open to a coalition government with the Viet Cong and had if either men were elected president, the war would be over by late 1971. Thi·ªáu used a legal technicality to disqualify K·ª≥ while Minh dropped out when it was clear the election was rigged. In the 1971 election, the CIA donated money for Thi·ªáu's reelection campaign while the Americans did not pressure Thi·ªáu to stop rigging the election. Through Kissinger did not regard South Vietnam as important in its own right, he believed it was necessary to support South Vietnam to maintain the United States as a global power, believing that none of America's allies would trust the United States if South Vietnam were abandoned too quickly. Kissinger also believed that if South Vietnam were to collapse, it \\"leave deep scars on our society, feeling impulses for recrimination\\". As a Jew who had grown up in Nazi Germany, Kissinger was haunted by how the Dolchsto√ülegende had used by the German right to delegitimatize the Weimar Republic, and believed that something similar would happen in the United States should it lose the Vietnam War, fueling the rise of right-wing extremism. In June 1971, Kissinger supported Nixon's effort to ban the Pentagon Papers saying the \\"hemorrhage of state secrets\\" to the media was making diplomacy impossible. Kissinger told Nixon about the leak: \\"No foreign country will ever trust us again. We might just as well turn it all over to the Soviets and get it over with\\". Knowing Nixon's fears, Kissinger told him that if he did nothing \\"it shows that you're weak, Mr. President. The fact that some idiot can publish all the diplomatic secrets of this country on his own is damaging to your image as the Soviets are concerned and it could destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy\\". Daniel Ellsberg, the man who leaked the Pentagon Papers to the New York Times had been consulted by Kissinger for ideas about Vietnam in late 1968-early 1969, but when he leaked the papers, Kissinger told Nixon that he was a left-wing \\"fanatic\\" and a \\"drug abuser\\". Kissinger depicted Ellsberg to Nixon as a drug-crazed, sexually perverted degenerate of questionable mental stability out to ruin his administration. Reflecting his increasingly frustration with the war, Nixon often talked to Kissinger in a bloodthirsty manner about a \\"fantasy holocaust\\" in which he would have U.S. forces kill every living thing in North Vietnam and then pull out, leading the latter appalled by his own account. By early 1972, Nixon boasted that he had pulled out 400,000 U.S soldiers from Vietnam since July 1969, and battle deaths had fallen from an average of 200 per week in 1969 down to an average of 10 per week in 1972. The policy of Vietnamization had, as Laird predicted it would, tamed the antiwar movement as most Americans objected not to war in Vietnam per se, only to Americans dying in it. With the antiwar movement in decline by 1972, Nixon believed his chances of reelection were good, but Kissinger kept complaining that he was losing \\"negotiating assets\\" in his talks with Tho every time a withdrawal of American forces was announced. Likewise, Kissinger noted that the major reason why Congress despite the antiwar feelings of many of its members kept voting to fund the war was because the argument it was patriotic to support \\"our boys in the field\\"; as more Americans were pulled out, Congress was less inclined to vote to fund keeping South Vietnamese \\"boys in the field\\". However, the imperatives of being re-elected was far more important to Nixon than with giving Kissinger \\"negotiating assets\\". In early 1972, Nixon publicly revealed that Kissinger had secretly negotiating with Tho since 1970 to prove that he was really was committed to peace in Vietnam despite what the antiwar movement had been saying about him for the last three years. Reflecting Kissinger's weakening hand in his talks with Tho, Nixon had increasingly come by 1971‚Äì72 to believe that \\"linkage\\" concept of improving relations with the Soviet Union and China in exchange for those nations cutting off the supply of weapons to North Vietnam offered his best chance of a favorable peace deal. On 6 April 1972, Tho requested Kissinger to meet him in Paris, a request that Kissinger rejected as \\"insolent\\". 21 February 1972 was in Nixon's words \\"the week that changed the world\\" as he landed in Beijing to meet Mao Zedong. Kissinger, who accompanied Nixon to China, spent much time talking to the suave Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai about Vietnam, pressing him to end the supply of arms to North Vietnam. The talks went nowhere as Zhou told Kissinger that the North Vietnamese played off China against the Soviet Union, and to cut off North Vietnam would allow it to fall into the Soviet sphere of influence. As the Chinese People's Liberation Army had been badly bloodied by the Red Army in a border war in 1969, Zhou stated that to face a two-front war with Chinese forces facing North Vietnam in the south and the Soviet Union in the north was not acceptable to his government. Zhou offered Kissinger only the vague message that China supported efforts to find peace in Vietnam while refusing to make any promises, though Kissinger also noted that Zhou declined to endorse North Vietnam's demands. Despite Nixon's coming visit, in late 1971 the Chinese drastically increased their military aid to North Vietnam and continued to send a massive amount of weapons south even as Nixon and Kissinger exchanged pleasantries with Mao and Zhou in Beijing. As usual, when the Chinese increased their supply of arms to North Vietnam, the Soviet Union did likewise as both Communist states competed with one another for influence in Hanoi by tying to be the biggest supplier of weapons. On 30 March 1972, the PAVN launched the Easter Offensive that overran several provinces in South Vietnam while pushing the ARVN to the brink of collapse. By 1 April 1972, the 3rd ARVN division was retreating south with their families. Kissinger summoned Dobrynin to the White House to accuse the Soviet Union of responsibility for the Easter Offensive, saying the North Vietnamese were fighting with Soviet- made weapons, and asked the Soviets to pressure the North Vietnamese to end the offensive. At the time of the Easter Offensive, Kissinger was deeply involved in planning for Nixon's visit to Moscow in May 1972. The offensive brought to the fore the differences between Nixon and Kissinger. Nixon threatened to cancel his summit with Leonid Brezhnev in Moscow if the Soviet Union did not force North Vietnam to end the Easter Offensive at once, saying: \\"Whatever else happens, we cannot lose this war. The summit isn't worth a damn if the price for it is losing in Vietnam\\". Nixon in his instructions to Kissinger stated that he viewed the relations with the Soviet Union through the prism of the Vietnam war and if the Soviets were not prepared to help, Kissinger \\"should just pack up and come home\\". Kissinger for his part believed that Nixon was massively exaggerating Soviet influence in North Vietnam and not longer believed if he ever did in Nixon's \\"linkage\\" concept. Kissinger feared that Nixon was obsessed with Vietnam and damaging relations with the Soviet Union over Vietnam would destabilize the international power balance by increasing American-Soviet tensions. On 20 April 1972, Kissinger arrived in Moscow without informing the U.S. ambassador Jacob D. Beam, and then went to have tea with Brezhnev in the Kremlin. Nixon as usual when under stress departed for a marathon drinking session with Rebozo at Camp David, and via Haig kept sending messages to Kissinger to be tough with Brezhnev. As no American president had ever visited Moscow before, Kissinger got the impression that Brezhnev wanted the planned summit to happen \\"at almost any cost\\". Despite Nixon's orders, Kissinger was rather emollient with Brezhnev and through Nixon's instructions stated he was only to discuss Vietnam, he began to talk about arms control instead. Kissinger informed Brezhnev the United States wanted all of the PAVN divisions taking part in the present offensive returned to North Vietnam at once, a \\"demand\\" that many historians argue was in fact a disguised concession as Kissinger only mentioned the divisions sent south for the Eastern Offensive, presumably meaning that the PAVN divisions who had arrived before the Easter Offensive could stay, thus abandoning the \\"mutual withdrawal formula\\" that Tho had rejected out of hand so many times. Kissinger in his memoirs called this claim \\"pure nonsense\\", but Tho at the time interpreted Kissinger's statement to Brezhnev in those terms. Kissinger reportedly considered his demand that the three PAVN divisions engaged in the Easter Offensive to be a \\"throwaway\\" as he did not expect North Vietnam to pull any troops out of South Vietnam. Upon his return to Washington, Kissinger reported that Brezhnev would not cancel the summit and was keen to sign the SALT I Treaty. Kissinger went to Paris on 3 May to meet Tho with orders from Nixon that North Vietnam must \\"Settle or else!\\" Nixon complained that Kissinger was \\"obsessed\\" with the need for a peace treaty while he charged that he now wished he followed his instincts to bomb North Vietnam in 1970, saying if he had done so, the war would have been over by now. On 2 May 1972, the PAVN had captured Quangtri, an important provincial city in South Vietnam, and as a result of this victory, Tho was in no mood for a compromise. Through Kissinger in general shared Nixon's determination to be tough, he was afraid that the president would overreact and destroy the budding d√©tente with the Soviet Union and China by striking too hard at North Vietnam. Moreover, after the rupture caused by the Cambodian incursion, Kissigner was trying hard to rebuilt his relations with the liberal American intelligentsia, saying he did want to become \\"this administration's Walt Rostow\\". Kissinger's predecessor, Rostow had once being a professor at Harvard, Oxford the MIT, and Cambridge, but serving as the National Security Adviser had shunned by the Ivy League universities and ended up at the lowly University of Texas, a fate that Kissinger was determined to avoid. On 5 May 1972, Nixon ordered the U.S. Air Force to start bombing Hanoi and Haiphong and on 8 May ordered the U.S Navy to mine the coast of North Vietnam. As the bombings and mining of North Vietnam, Nixon and even more so Kissinger waited anxiously for the Soviet reaction, and much to their relief received only the standard statement decrying the American action and a diplomatic note complaining that American aircraft had bombed a Soviet freighter in Haiphong harbor. The Moscow summit was not canceled. On 6 May 1972, Kissinger returned to Paris to face Tho again. Nixon had ordered Kissinger to be severe, saying \\"non nonsense. No niceness. No accommodations\\". As a result, Kissinger was unusually unfriendly, and snapped when Tho mentioned that Senator J. William Fulbright was criticizing the Vietnam war: \\"Our domestic discussions are no concerns of yours\\". Tho told Kissinger \\"I'm giving an example to prove that Americans share our views\\", and then stated that the United States had never followed the Geneva Accords. Tho charged that the American terms calling for a withdraw from Vietnam months after a peace agreement was signed was unacceptable. Kissinger promised that a peace agreement was signed, a general election would be called to elect a new South Vietnamese president, Thieu would resign, and that the Communists could take in the election. When Kissinger asked when Thieu should resign, Thuy told him \\"Tomorrow is best\\". Kissinger: \\"All other members, except Thieu can remain in the administration, can' t they\\". Thuy stated that they could, but there had to be release of political prisoners and press freedom, leading Kissinger to ask: \\"Can anybody publish a newspaper in North Vietnam? I ask for my own education\\". On 19 July 1972, Kissinger again met Tho in Paris. He asked the rhetorical question: \\"If the United States can accept governments in large countries that are not pro- American, why should it insist on a pro-U.S. government in Saigon?\\". Tho charged that Kissinger was bringing nothing new. Prelude to the Endgame: Peace-making, Paris 1972 On 24 July 1972, Congress passed an act calling for the total withdrawal of all American forces from Vietnam once all of the American POWs in North Vietnam were released, causing Kissinger to say the North Vietnamese only had to wait until \\"Congress voted us out of the war\\". However, the sight of Nixon and Kissinger posing for photographs with Brezhnev and Mao deeply worried the North Vietnamese who were afraid of being \\"sold out\\" by either China or the Soviet Union, causing some flexibility in their negotiating tactics. The Eastern Offensive had not caused the collapse of the South Vietnamese government, but it increased the amount of territory under Communist control. The North Vietnamese were moving towards taking up the \\"standstill ceasefire\\" offer and ordered the Viet Cong to seize as much territory as possible in preparation for a \\"leopard's spot\\" ceasefire (so called because the patchwork of territories controlled by the Viet Cong and the Saigon government resembled the spots on a leopard's fur). On 1 August 1972, Kissinger met Tho again in Paris, and for first time, he seemed willing to compromise, saying that political and military terms of an armistice could be treated separately and hinted that his government was no longer willing to make the overthrow of Thi·ªáu a precondition. Kissinger for his part seemed keen to make a deal before the elections, saying that if an agreement was signed by 1 September, all American forces would be out of Vietnam by the end of 1972. Tho demanded $8 billion in reparations for war damage, a demand that Kissinger rejected. By this time, Kissinger's deputy, Alexander Haig, was spying on him on behalf of Nixon. While Kissinger remained optimistic about peace in Vietnam, Haig was pessimistic. Nixon wrote on the margin of a note from Haig: ‚ÄúAl-it is obvious that no progress has been made and that none can be expected‚Äù. . On 23 August 1972, Kissinger flew to Saigon to meet Thieu and oversee the withdraw of the last U.S. combat troops from South Vietnam. Thieu was distrustful of Kissinger and pressed him to maintain the \\"mutual withdrawal formula\\". Kissinger did not tell him that he was on the verge of disregarding it. On 15 September 1972, Kissinger at another meeting in Paris told Tho: ‚ÄúWe wish to end before October 15-if sooner, all the better‚Äù. . Haig visited Saigon to 4 October 1972 to see Thieu, who spent four hours ranting against Kissinger, accusing him of wanting to betray South Vietnam. Haig sent the transcript of the conversation straight to Nixon. . Nixon's chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, wrote in his diary that Kissinger and Haig were making completely opposite conclusions, but went on to note: ‚ÄúUnlike ‚Äô68 when Thieu screwed Johnson, he had Nixon as an alterative. Now he has McGovern as an alternative, which would be a disaster for him, even worse than the worse possible thing that Nixon could do to him‚Äù. . In early October, Nixon demanded that Haig had to be present at all of Kissinger's meetings with Tho as he not longer trusted him. On the evening of 8 October 1972 at a secret meeting of Kissinger and Tho in a house in the Paris suburb of Gif-sur-Yvette once owned by the painter Fernard L√©ger came the decisive breakthrough in the talks. Tho believed that Kissinger was as he later it put \\"in a rush\\" for a peace deal before the presidential election, and began with he called \\"a very realistic and very simple proposal\\" for a ceasefire that would see the Americans pull all their forces out of Vietnam in exchange for the release of all the POWs in North Vietnam. As for the ultimate fate of South Vietnam, Tho proposed the creation of a \\"council of national reconciliation\\" that would govern the nation, but in the meantime Thi·ªáu could stay in power until the council was formed while a \\"leopard's spot\\" ceasefire would come into effect with the Viet Cong and the Saigon government controlling whatever territories they were had at the time of the ceasefire. The \\"mutual withdrawal formula\\" was to be disregarded with PAVN forces to stay in South Vietnam with Tho giving Kissinger a vague promise that no more supplies would be sent down the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Kissinger accepted Tho's offer as the most best deal possible, saying that the \\"mutual withdrawal formula\\" had to be abandoned as it been \\"unobtainable through ten years of war...We could not make it a condition for a final settlement. We had long passed that threshold\\". Several of Kissinger's own staff, most notably John Negroponte, were strongly opposed to him accepting this offer, saying Kissinger had given away more than he had obtained. In response to Negronponte's objections, Kissinger exploded in rage, accusing him of \\"nit-picking\\" and screamed at the top of his voice: \\"You don't understand. I want to meet their terms. I want to reach an agreement. I want to end this war before the election. It can be done and it will be done. What do you want us to do? Stay there forever?\\". Kissinger told Tho that he would go to Washington and Saigon to get the approval of Nixon and Thieu, and he expected the agreement to be signed on either 25 October or 26 October. On 12 October, Kissinger told Nixon ‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre got three for three, Mr. President‚Äù-meaning trips to China and the Soviet Union plus a peace agreement for Vietnam. Even the fact that under the peace agreement, the United States was to pay reparations to North Vietnam in the form of economic aid was seen as a benefit by Nixon, who commented that this would be a face of the Vietnamese Communists admitting to the economic failures of their system. Reflecting the \\"leopard's spot\\" ceasefire, Kissinger sent Thi·ªáu a message saying he should \\"seize as much territory as possible\\" before the ceasefire came into effect while the United States launched Operation Enhance Plus to give South Vietnam as many weapons as possible. Over the course of six weeks in the fall of 1972, South Vietnam ended up with the world's fourth largest air force as the Americans provided as many war planes as they possibly could. However, neither Kissinger nor Nixon appreciated that for Thi·ªáu any sort of peace deal calling for withdrawal of American forces was unacceptable and he saw the draft peace agreement that Kissinger signed in Paris on 18 October 1972 as a betrayal. Kissinger had kept the South Vietnamese in the dark about the peace deal, but the North Vietnamese had shared everything with the Viet Cong. Kissinger had sent Thieu an earlier version of the peace agreement that was less accommodating to him, hoping that when he saw the final agreement, he would approve. However, the ARVN had captured a 10-page summary of the peace agreement from a Viet Cong command post, and Thieu knew what the actual agreement was. On 21 October Kissinger together with the American ambassador Ellsworth Bunker arrived at the Gia Long Palace in Saigon to show Thi·ªáu the peace agreement. The meeting went extremely badly with Thi·ªáu engaged that Kissinger did not take the time to translate the draft peace treaty into Vietnamese, bringing with him only an English language copy. The meeting went from bad to worse with Thi·ªáu having a meltdown as he broke down in tears and hysterically accused Kissinger of plotting with the Soviet Union and China to betray him, saying he could never accept this peace agreement. Kissinger's statement that ‚ÄúHad we wanted to see you out, there would have been many easier ways by which we could have accomplished this‚Äù did not improve the mood. Thi·ªáu later stated that he wanted to punch Kissinger in the face at that meeting. Thi·ªáu refused to sign the peace agreement and demanded very extensive amendments that Kissinger reported to Nixon \\"verge on insanity\\". Nixon ordered Kissinger to \\"push Thi·ªáu as far as possible\\", but Thi·ªáu refused to sign the peace agreement. Thi·ªáu refused to see Kissinger the next day. Kissinger told one of Thieu's aides, Hoang Duc Nha, on the phone ‚ÄúI am the special envoy of the President of the United States of America. You know I cannot be treated as an errand boy\\". Nha replied ‚ÄúWe never considered you an errand boy, but if that‚Äôs what you think you are, there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it‚Äù. As Kissinger returned to Washington, one of his aides recalled \\"In twenty-four hours, the bottom fell out\\". Through Nixon had initially supported Kissinger against Thi·ªáu, but two of his most influential advisers, namely his Chief of Staff, H.R. Haldeman and the Domestic Affairs Adviser John Ehrlichman urged him to reconsider, arguing that Kissinger had given away too much and Thi·ªáu's objections had merit. As Thi·ªáu sensed Nixon's changing mood, on 24 October 1972 he called a press conference to denounce the draft agreement as a betrayal and stated the Viet Cong \\"must be wiped out quickly and mercilessly\\". On 25 October 1972, Kissinger held a meeting with the journalist Max Frankel of the New York Times to predict a peace agreement would occur in the next few days unless either North Vietnam or South Vietnam committed ‚Äúa supreme act of folly‚Äù. On October 26, North Vietnam published the draft agreement and accused the United States of tying to \\"sabotage\\" it by backing Thi·ªáu. On the same day, Kissinger who until then had never spoken to the media called a press conference at the White House to say: \\"We believe peace is at hand. We believe an agreement is within sight\\". Kissinger later admitted that this statement was a major mistake as it inflated hopes for peace while enraging Nixon who saw it as weakness. Nixon came very close to disavowing Kissinger as he declared the draft peace agreement had \\"differences that must be resolved\\". Taking up Thi·ªáu's cause as his own, Nixon wanted 69 amendments to the draft peace agreement included in the final treaty and ordered Kissinger back to Paris to force Tho to accept them. Kissinger regarded Nixons' 69 amendments as \\"preposterous\\" as he knew Tho would never accept them. By this point, Kissinger's relations with Nixon were tense while Nixon's \\"German shepherds\\" Haldeman and Ehrlichman intrigued against him. The Endgame: the Christmas Bombings and the Paris peace accords, 1972-1973 On 20 November 1972, Kissinger met Tho again in Paris. Kissinger no longer aimed at secrecy and was followed by paparazzi as he went to a house owned by the French Communist Party where Tho was waiting for him. Kissinger announced that the Americans wanted major changes to the peace agreement made in October to accommodate Thieu, which led Tho to accuse him of negotiating in bad faith. Tho stated: \\"We have been deceived by the French, the Japanese and the Americans. But the deception has never been so flagrant as of now\\". Kissinger insisted the changes he wanted were only minor, but in effect he wanted to renegotiate almost the entire agreement. Kissinger wanted to eliminate all of the powers assigned to the National Reconciliation Council and for the National Liberation Front's Provisional Revolutionary Government to be prevented from signing the peace accords. Tho rejected Kissinger's terms, saying he would abide by the terms agreed to on 8 October. Putting more pressure, Nixon told Kissinger to break off the talks if Tho would not agree to the changes he wanted. Being reelected for a second term meant Nixon was not longer concerned about public opinion as before, and in November 1972, he seriously considered firing Kissinger. Through Nixon decided that Thieu's 69 amendments were unrealistic, he also wanted a demonstration of force to prove that he was still willing to stand by South Vietnam. Kissinger told Nixon: \\"While we have a moral case for bombing North Vietnam when it does not accept our terms, it seems to be really stretching the point to bomb North Vietnam when it has accepted our terms and when South Vietnam has not\\". As expected, Tho refused to consider any of the 69 amendments and on 13 December 1972 left Paris for Hanoi after he accused the Americans of negotiating in bad faith. Kissinger by this stage was worked up into a state of fury after Tho walked out of the Paris talks and told Nixon: \\"They're just a bunch of shits. Tawdry, filthy shits. They make the Russians look good, compared to the way the Russians make the Chinese look good when it comes to negotiating in a responsible and decent way\\". The National Security Adviser now advised Nixon to bomb North Vietnam to make them \\"talk seriously\\". On 14 December 1972, Nixon sent an ultimatum demanding that Tho return to Paris to \\"negotiate seriously\\" within the 72 hours or else he would bomb North Vietnam without limit. Knowing that Nixon was considering sacking him, Kissinger approved of his decision to resume bombing North Vietnam. Kissinger told the media that the peace agreement was \\"99 percent completed\\" but \\"we will not be blackmailed into an agreement. We will not be stampeded into an agreement and, if I may say so, we will not be charmed into an agreement until its conditions are right\\". At the same time, Nixon ordered Admiral Thomas Hinman Moorer, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff: \\"I don't want any more of this crap about the fact that we couldn't hit this target or that one. This is your chance to use military power to win this war, and if you don't, I'll hold you responsible\\". Following the rejection of Nixon's ultimatum, on 18 December, Operation Linebacker II was launched, the so-called Christmas Bombings that lasted until 29 December 1972. During these 11 days that consisted of the heaviest bombing of the entire war, B-52 bombers flew 3, 000 sorties and dropped 40, 000 tons of bombs on Hanoi and Haiphong. About 1, 261 people were killed in Hanoi and another 305 in Haiphong as the North Vietnamese authorities pulled out people out of the cities before hand to escape the expected bombings. At the time of the Christmas bombings, a columnist for the New York Times, Scotty Reston, stated that based on unnamed sources that Kissinger was opposed to the Christmas bombings, and was planning to write a book that \\"would probably be highly embarrassing to Mr. Nixon\\" if he was fired. Nixon accused Kissinger of talking to Reston, which he denied, until he was caught out when the White House phone log showed that he called Reston several times just before his column ran. On 26 December 1972, in a press statement Hanoi indicated a willingness to resume the Paris peace talks provided that the bombing stopped. On 8 January 1973, Kissinger and Tho met again in Paris and the next day reached an agreement, which in main points was essentially the same as the one Nixon had rejected in October with only cosmetic concessions to the Americans. At his meeting with Tho on 8 January 1973 in a house in the French town of Gif-sur-Yvette, Kissinger arrived to find nobody at the door to greet him.Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon and Schuster 2000 p. 619 When Kissinger entered the conference room, nobody spoke to him. Sensing the hostile mood, Kissinger speaking in French said: \\"It was not my fault about the bombing\\". Before Kissinger could say anymore, Tho exploded in rage, saying in French: \\"Under the pretext of interrupted negotiations, you resumed the bombing of North Vietnam, just at the moment when I reached home. You have 'greeted' my arrival in a very courteous manner! You action, I can say, is flagrant and gross! You and no one else strained the honor of the United States\\". Tho shouted at Kissinger for over an hour, and despite Kissinger's requests not to speak so loudly because the reporters outside the room could hear what he was saying, he did not relent. Tho concluded: \\"For more than ten years, America has used violence to beat down the Vietnamese people-napalm, B-52s. But you don't draw any lessons from your failures. You continue the same policy. Ngu xuan! Ngu xuan! Ngu xuan!\\". When Kissinger asked what ngu xuan meant in Vietnamese, the translator refused to translate, as ngu xuan roughly means that a person is grossly stupid. When Kissinger was finally able to speak, he argued that it was Tho who by being unreasonable had forced Nixon to order the Christmas bombings, an claim that led Tho to snap in fury: \\"You've spent billions of dollars and many tons of bombs when we had a text ready to sign\\". Kissigner replied: \\"I have heard many adjectives in your comments. I propose that you should not use them\\". Tho answered: \\"I have used those adjectives with a great deal of restraint already. The world opinion, the U.S. press and U.S. political personalities have used harsher words\\". After the tirade, negotiations proceeded well. Kissinger inserted a vaguely written paragraph calling for the withdraw of all foreign forces from South Vietnam, which Tho accepted while at the same time saying the PAVN forces were not foreign. On the night of 9 January 1973, Kissinger phoned Nixon in Washington to say that a peace agreement would be signed very soon.Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon and Schuster 2000 p. 620 On 10 January 1973, the negotiations broke down when Kissinger demanded the release of all American POWs in North Vietnam once a peace agreement was signed, but offered no guarantees about Viet Cong prisoners being held in South Vietnam. Tho stated: \\"I cannot accept your proposal. I completely reject it\\". Tho wanted the release of all prisoners once a peace agreement was signed, which led Kissinger to say this was an unreasonable demand. Tho who had been tortured as an young man by the French colonial police for advocating Vietnamese independence shouted: \\"You have never been a prisoner. You don't understand suffering. It's unfair\\". Kissinger finally offered the concession that the United States would use \\"maximum influence\\" to pressure the South Vietnamese government to release all Viet Cong prisoners within sixty days of a peace agreement being signed. Kissinger was interviewed by the Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci, and boasted he was \\"the cowboy who rides all alone into town with his horse and nothing else\\", saying the \\"amazing romantic character suits me precisely because to be alone has always been part of my character\\". Kissinger's self-portrayal as the heroic \\"cowboy\\" who was responsible for all of the foreign policy successes of the Nixon administration enraged Nixon, who almost fired him for that interview. Kissinger denied that he made the remarks that Fallaci attributed to him, only for her to play an audio tape which proved that he did say the things that he was now denying. Thi·ªáu once again rejected the peace agreement, only to receive an ultimatum from Nixon: \\"You must decide now whether you desire to continue our alliance or whether you want me to seek a settlement with the enemy which serves U.S. interests alone\\". Nixon told Kissinger: \\"Brutality is nothing. You have never seen it if this son-of-a-bitch doesn't go along, believe me\\". Nixon's threat served its purpose and Thi·ªáu reluctantly accepted the peace agreement. On 23 January 1973 at 12: 45 pm, Kissinger and Tho signed a peace agreement in Paris that called for the complete withdrawal of all U.S forces from Vietnam by March in exchange for North Vietnam freeing all the U.S POWs. During the three years from 1969 to 1972, 20, 533 Americans had been killed in Vietnam together with about 107, 000 ARVN soldiers and as the American historian A.J. Langguth noted: \\"...perhaps five time that number of North Vietnamese and Vietcong troops. Civilian casualties were impossible to estimate. They may have run to a million men, women and children\\". In February 1973, as the Khmer Rouge continued to win victories against the Lon Nol regime, American bombing of Cambodia was increased. On 15 March 1973, Nixon had implied during a speech that the United States might go back into Vietnam should the Communists violate the ceasefire, and as a result Congress began debating a bill to limit American funding for military operations in Southeast Asia. On 29 March 1973, the withdrawal of the Americans from Vietnam was complete and on 1 April 1973, the last American POWs were freed. The peace agreement put into effect the \\"leopard's spot\\" ceasefire with the Viet Cong being allowed to rule whatever parts of South Vietnam they held at the time of the ceasefire and all of the North Vietnamese troops in South Vietnam were allowed to stay, putting the Communists in a strong position to eventually take over South Vietnam. Public opinion polls in 1973 showed that 52% of Americans were opposed to military aid to South Vietnam if North Vietnam should violate the Paris peace accords and 71% were against the return of American troops to Vietnam. In April 1973 the CIA estimated the total number of PAVN troops in South Vietnam at 150, 000 (about the same as in 1972) whereas Kissinger accused North Vietnam of moving more troops down the Ho Chi Minh Trail. That month, Kissinger met with Tho in Paris to reaffirm their commitment to the Paris peace agreement and to pressure him to stop the Khmer Rouge from overrunning Cambodia. Tho told Kissinger that the Khmer Rouge's leader, Pol Pot, was a Vietnamphobe and North Vietnam had very limited influence over him. At the same time, Kissinger reported to Nixon that \\"only a miracle\\" could save South Vietnam now as Thi·ªáu showed no signs of making the necessary reforms to allow the ARVN to fight. His assessment of Cambodia was even more bleaker as the Lon Nol regime had lost control of much of the countryside by the spring of 1973 and only American air strikes prevented the Khmer Rouge from taking Phnom Penh. Between March‚ÄìMay 1973, American bombers dropped 95, 000 tons of bombs on Cambodia while American fighters dropped another 15, 000 tons of bombs. On 4 June 1973, the Senate passed a bill that already cleared the House of Representatives to block funding for any American military operations in Indochina and Kissinger spent much of the summer of 1973 lobbying Congress to extent the deadline to 15 August in order to keep bombing Cambodia. The Lon Nol regime was saved in 1973 due to heavy American bombing, but the cutoff in funding ended the possibility of an American return to Southeast Asia. The PAVN had taken heavy losses in the Easter Offensive, but North Vietnamese were rebuilding their strength for a new offensive. By the spring of 1973, Nixon was caught up in the Watergate scandal and was losing interest in foreign affairs. Kissigner was angry that the Secretary of State, William Rogers, had not resigned so he take could over the State Department, shouting: \\"And now's he's hanging on just I said he would. Piece by piece. Bit by bit. He stays on and on and on! He will be with me forever- because he has this President wrapped around his little finger\\". Not until August 1973 did Nixon inform Kissinger that he was sacking Rogers and appointing him as his successor. Thi·ªáu's government was still receiving massive amounts of military aid, and his regime controlled 75% of South Vietnam's territory and 85% of the population at the time of the ceasefire. But Thi·ªáu's unwillingness to crackdown on corruption and end the system under which ARVN officers were promoted for political loyalty instead of military merit were structural weaknesses that spelled long-term problems for his regime. South Vietnam's economy's had heavily dependent upon the hundreds of millions brought in by spending by the U.S. military and the withdraw of American forces threw the economy into recession. Even more damaging was the Arab oil shock of 1973‚Äì74 which destabilized South Vietnam's economy and by the summer of 1974 90% of the ARVN's soldiers were not receiving enough pay to support themselves and their families. The Last Days of South Vietnam, 1973-1975 Along with North Vietnamese Politburo Member Le Duc Tho, Kissinger was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on December 10, 1973, for their work in negotiating the ceasefires contained in the Paris Peace Accords on \\"Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Vietnam\\", signed the previous January. According to Irwin Abrams, this prize was the most controversial to date. For the first time in the history of the Peace Prize, two members left the Nobel Committee in protest. Tho rejected the award, telling Kissinger that peace had not been restored in South Vietnam.Le Duc Tho to Henry Kissinger, October 27, 1973. Kissinger wrote to the Nobel Committee that he accepted the award \\"with humility,\\" and \\"donated the entire proceeds to the children of American servicemembers killed or missing in action in Indochina.\\" After the Fall of Saigon in 1975, Kissinger attempted to return the award. As the South Vietnamese economy to collapse under the weight of inflation caused by the Arab oil shock and rampant corruption, by the summer of 1974, the U.S. embassy reported that morale in the ARVN had fallen to dangerously low levels and it was uncertain how much more longer South Vietnam would last. Widespread protests against corruption that broke out in the summer of 1974 with the protesters accusing Thi·ªáu and his family of corruption indicated that the South Vietnamese regime had lost popular support. In August 1974, Congress passed a bill limiting American aid to South Vietnam to $700 million annually. By November 1974, fearing the worse for South Vietnam as the ARVN continued to lose, Kissinger during the Vladivostok summit lobbied Brezhnev to end Soviet military aid to North Vietnam. The same month, he also lobbied Mao and Zhou to end Chinese military aid to North Vietnam during a visit to Beijing. On 1 March 1975 the PAVN began an offensive that saw them overrun the Central Highlands and by 25 March Hue had fallen. Thi·ªáu was slow to withdraw his armies and by 30 March when Danang fell, the ARVN's best divisions were lost. With the road to Saigon wide open, it became imperative for the North Vietnamese to take the capital before the monsoons began in May, leading to a rapid march on Saigon. Kissinger resisted pressure from the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Defense Secretary, James Schlesinger, to withdraw American civilians from South Vietnam, saying it would damage South Vietnamese morale. He advised President Ford to not have the U.S. Air Force bomb the advancing PAVN forces, saying \\"If you do that, the American people will take to the streets again\\". He expressed little sympathy with South Vietnam, saying: \\"Why don't those people die faster? The worse thing that could happen would be for them to linger on\\". On 15 April 1975, Kissinger testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee, urging Congress to increase the military aid budget to South Vietnam by another $700 million to save the ARVN as the PAVN was rapidly advancing on Saigon, which was refused. Kissinger maintained at the time, and still maintains that if only Congress had approved of his request for another $700 million South Vietnam would have been saved. In opposition, Karnow argued that by this point, South Vietnam was so far gone with the morale in the ARVN having collapsed it is very doubtful that anything short of sending in U.S. troops again could have saved South Vietnam. On 17 April 1975, the Lon Nol regime collapsed and the Khmer Rouge took Phnom Penh. On 20 April 1975, Kissinger instructed Graham Martin, the ambassador in Saigon, to start preparing to pull out all the Americans in South Vietnam while also saying there no South Vietnamese were to pulled out. Martin in a telephone call to Kissinger complained the \\"only ass which isn't covered is mine\\". Kissinger assured him: \\"When this thing is finally over, I'll be hanging several yards higher than you\\". On 29 April 1975, Option IV, the largest helicopter evacuation began as 70 Marine helicopters flew 8, 000 people from the American embassy in Saigon to the fleet offshore. The same day, Kissinger ordered Martin to blow up the satellite terminal at the U. S embassy in Saigon, saying \\"I want you heroes home\\". At 7:53 am, the last Marine helicopter flew away from the embassy in Saigon, marking the end of the American presence in Vietnam. On 30 April 1975, Saigon fell to the PAVN and the war in Vietnam finally ended.

He was known by the titles Kuyanbanan Zazzau and Agwatyap I. In 1964, Dauke participated in the election for a seat in the Northern Region House of Representatives in Kaduna, for the Zangon Katab constituency, but lost to another Atyap (Katab/Kataf) man, Hon. Shekarau Kaah. In 1967, Bala Ade Dauke Gora, was appointed as the first Christian indigenous District Head of Zangon Katab after the rejection of another Christian, John Sarki Tafida, considered unqualified for the position by Southern Zaria (now Southern Kaduna) elites due to his Fulani origins and roots in the Zaria Native Authority. His appointment was not only seen as a means of compensation for his lost bid for a seat in the Northern Region House of Representatives in Kaduna but, also most importantly, to quell the decades-long agitations by the Atyap people for self-autonomy. He had the longest reign as District Head of Zangon Kataf and Kuyambanan Zazzau for 28 years (1967-1995) when the Atyap people were formally removed from the Zazzau (Zaria) Emirate Council by the Kaduna State government military government of Lawal Jafaru Isa, then in power and the long overdue Atyap Chiefdom was created. Dauke thereupon became the Agwatyap (Chief of the Atyap), the first indigenous of them all. Earlier on, following the Zangon Kataf disturbances of May 1992 in which at least 21 indigenous Atyap people were arrested and left in detention without charge or trial under Decree 2 of 1984 enacted by the Nigerian military government, Bala Ade Dauke was one of those arrested alongside Dominic G.

A strong house was constructed around 1556 to protect a sugar mill, and the site was subsequently significantly expanded. The building complex was renovated in the 1700s before a fire left it in ruins in 1902, a state in which it remains today, leading to its inclusion on the Spanish Redlist of endangered heritage in 2019.  Construction  The initial construction at the site was a sugar mill built by the Genoese Ponte family, which was powered by water from the nearby Barranco del Infierno. However, in the 1500s pirate attacks were common in the Adeje region. In 1553, Pedro Ponte requested permission to build a fortification in Adeje to protect his sugar mill against their attacks. Permission was granted on 2 May 1555. The strong house was subsequently constructed around 1556, and it is one of the oldest buildings on Tenerife. It is located adjacent to the Santa √örsula Church, in the oldest part of Adeje. It became the centre for politics, economy and social activity in the area for the next 300 years, known for its camels, horses, and black slaves. It also employed workers, butlers and administrators.  Layout  The strong house above the ruins on the southern side The site turned into a large complex with multiple buildings spread over a square of around . The earliest known plan of the structure was made in 1873. The complex had a single entrance on the east fa√ßade, topped by a pediment, that leads to a central paved courtyard surrounded by buildings. A crenellated watchtower and gun platform looks over the Atlantic Ocean on the south side; this was initially also used as a gunpowder store and prison and later became the administrator's residence. Also on the south side of the complex were rooms for the residence of the Marquis of Adeje and the archives and accounting, plus a barn and pantries. In the centre were the smithy, stables, and furnace (later turned into a two-storey house), with the sugar mill behind them. Slave quarters were to the right of the main entrance. The complex also housed a bakery, a granary, stables, and a public chapel. On 28 August 1651 an audit showed that the armament of the strong house was 9-10 cannon, 56 muskets, and 46 pikes, along with a trumpet. By 1655 this had increased to 17 cannon with 400 cannonballs. By 1737 this decreased to just 5 cannon.  Later history  A view inside the complex from the north side The ruins on the west side The complex was renovated in the 18th century by the Marques de Adeje at the time, Domingo Jos√© de Herrera y Rojas, who was the last Marquis to live in the building. From 1766 onwards the owners resided in Madrid. As of 1779, 57 people lived in the complex. The sugar mill was the oldest in Tenerife when it stopped operating in 1811 due to poor crops from the cane fields, which were subsequently used for vineyards and fruit plantations. On 9 April 1902, the entire structure caught fire. The tower and entrance gate survived, along with the walls of the kitchen, parts of the enclosure, and the bakery. The animals and the family archives also survived, with the archives subsequently moved to a museum; they are now in the Museo Canario and are available online at archivohistoricoadeje.es. Consisting of four large cabinets of documents, the archives were described by Sabin Berthelot as \\"the Treasury of the Canaries\\". Furniture, paintings, chain mail and weapons from the stronghouse also survived as they had previously been moved to Madrid. In 1904, the Curbelo de Gran Canaria family moved into the complex, and constructed new buildings inside the complex and outside its walls, particularly at the eastern front of the complex, which was previously an open yard. The land was used to produce tomatoes, as well as bananas, aubergines, and oranges and lemons, that were packaged on site and exported to the Spanish mainland and the rest of Europe. Around 40-50 people were employed on the site. In the 1980s, competition from elsewhere led to the closure of the packing plant, although the growing of tomatoes at the site continued until the early 2000s under the San Sebastian cooperative. On 7 February 1986 it was protected as a structure of historical interest to the Canary Islands. It was added to the Spanish Redlist (lista rojo) of endangered heritage on 13 May 2019 as it is currently ruined and abandoned, with no conservation work taking place, although some work took place in 2018‚Äì19.

On 1 August 1962, Kwame Nkrumah stopped in Kulungugu, a minor port of entry in the Pusiga District in Upper East Bawku. There was a bomb explosion aimed at killing the President.  History  Nkrumah was coming from a meeting with President Maurice Yam√©ogo in Tenkodogo, Burkina Faso, at the time known as Upper Volta. The meeting was to sign documents relating to the construction of the major hydroelectric project on the Volta which would become Lake Volta. During the trip back to Ghana, heavy rains caused difficulties for the convoy on the country's bad roads. The Presidential convoy stopped at an outskirts of Bawku to greet school children who had been waving and catching glimpses of the President. A school child, Elizabeth Asantewaa, approached the president with a bouquet of flowers, was severely injured when the bomb exploded.The president was saved by his bodyguard, Captain Samuel Buckman, who instinctively wrestled the president to the ground after hearing the ticking of the timing device. The President and Buckman experience non life- threatening injuries, but 55 other people were injured. Nkrumah was treated by a British doctor at Bawku Hospital, who removed shrapnel from the President's back and side. A memorial stands at the site of the bombing.  Aftermath and trial Nkrumah accused Tawiah Adamafio, the Minister of Information, Broadcasting and Presidential affairs, Ako Adjei, Foreign Minister, and Hugh Horatio Cofie-Crabbe, executive secretary of the Convention People's Party, of being behind the assassination plot. They were jailed under the Preventive Detention Act. The three were cleared by a court headed by Chief Justice Arku Korsah in a trial which lasted for a year. Nkrumah had Korsah dismissed, and appointed a new court to recharge the men. Nkrumah handpicked the jury that found the three guilty and they were sentenced to death. Later, the death sentences were commuted to twenty year sentences. After Kwame Nkrumah was ousted from office in 1966, the three were released by the National Liberation Council (NLC).

Adults with special needs conditions encompass a wide range of people with physical and mental disabilities and in some individuals is a condition that results of the natural human aging process. The impact on each person is dependent on the severity of the disability or aging process and is expressed in a myriad of ways. For many, the disability affects the individuals‚Äô ability to access dentistry and other health care services. It also challenges any particular industry in their response to successfully provide needed services. This article will briefly identify commonly seen special needs conditions, comment on the challenges faced by adults with special needs conditions who seek dental care and identify modalities for care for dental professionals who provide treatment.  Special needs conditions  Adults with special needs conditions encompass a wide range of developmental, congenital and acquired disabilities. Some conditions are simply a result of the natural human aging process. The following are examples of special needs conditions that a person may present with: * ALS * Alzheimer's/Dementia * Autism * Cerebral Palsy * Chromosomal Abnormalities * Down Syndrome * Epilepsy * Geriatrics * Head and Neck Radiation patients * Intellectual and Developmental Deficits * Mental health disorders * MS * Muscular Dystrophy * Parkinson‚Äôs * Seizure Disorder * Spinal cord injury * Stroke * Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)  Challenges requiring accommodations  When adults with special needs conditions seek dental care some may need accommodations to enable them to have a successful dental visit. Anticipating a patient‚Äôs potential need for accommodations is a step toward treatment success. Some of the challenges that adults with special needs conditions face are, but not limited to: * Body movement * Cognitive challenges and difficulties processing directions and information * Dysphagia * Emotional outbursts: screaming, yelling, kicking, crying * Hearing challenges * Homebound * Inability to access a dental office * Inability to maintain mouth or head position * Inability to transfer to dental chair * Reflexive mouth movements/parafunction * Strength of patient * Strong gag reflex * Tongue thrusting * Trouble swallowing * Unable to cooperate due to behavior, unwilling to open mouth or sit in dental chair  Dental treatment modalities  If a dentist is aware of treatment modalities options then they, as the provider, can better assist the patient in receiving an optimal oral healthcare experience. Depending on the patient history and how the patient disability has impacted their ability to cooperate with treatment will guide the dental professional to selecting the modality or modalities for dental treatment. Some times it is necessary to use more than one technique. The various modalities of treatment available to an adult with special needs are the following but not limited to: * No accommodations * Behavior management (w/o Stabilization Board) * Behavior management (w/ Stabilization Board) * Oral Conscious Sedation * IV Sedation * General Anesthesia Choosing the best option to administer dental care will depend on the patient and their history of receiving dental treatment. For example, some patients may have been once able to tolerate dental procedures without accommodations but now that they are older they can no longer tolerate them and require assistance on some level. It could also be the case that a patient who is unable to brush and has combative behaviors, to no fault of their own, will likely require a sedation option. Speaking with the patient, caregiver, parent, or social worker to learn the patient‚Äôs history, behaviors, and needs should be the first step in choosing which modality to use. Adults with special needs present with various conditions with varying degrees of disability. Some adults with special needs face access to care challenges due to internal and external factors. Healthcare professionals also face challenges in providing care for adults with special needs if they lack confidence and/or skill. Treating patients with special needs conditions can be both hard work and rewarding work for the patient, the dentist and team members. Ideally, the dentist needs to work with the patient and caregiver, parent or social worker, and the dental team to assist the patient in determining the best modality for dental treatment delivery. = References = = Links = * American Dental Association Special Needs * American Society of Dentist Anesthesiologists) * Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center * National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ","title":"Dental treatment modalities for adults with special needs conditions"},{"id":"64806024","text":"Frimpong Manso (1931 - 2020, 89 years) also known as Osofo Dadzie, was a Ghanaian veteran actor and producer who the lead character on Osofo Dadzie, a Ghanaian television drama series between 1970 and 1983.

Abdalla Yones killed his daughter for becoming too \\"westernised\\" and for engaging in a relationship against his wishes. He was sentenced to life in prison in September 2003, with a minimum term of fourteen years. Heshu's case was the first in the United Kingdom to be legally recognised and prosecuted as an honour killing; it led to the creation of a specialist task force in honour- based violence and, subsequently, to the reviewing of more than 100 previous cases of murder and suicide for any indication that \\"honour\\" was a factor.  Background  Heshu was born in Iraqi Kurdistan circa 1986. She was the middle of three children born to Abdalla and Tanya Yones. An Iraqi Kurd, Abdalla Yones was an active member of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), fighting for them from 1980 until 1991. Members of his extended family were killed under the tenure of Saddam Hussein and he himself was injured as a result of a chemical weapons attack, from which he suffered lasting consequences. He fled with his family to the United Kingdom during the first Gulf War, where they were granted asylum . While the family adjusted well to life in the United Kingdom, Yones struggled to adapt and was described as \\"a fish out of water\\". Heshu attended William Morris Academy in Fulham, where she began a relationship with a fellow pupil. As her father expected her to live by their familial cultural and religious traditions, she led a double life; she would put make-up on only after leaving the house and she had her friends lie about her whereabouts so she could spend time with her boyfriend. She started truanting, her school grades suffered, she failed exams and ran up large bills on her mobile phone. In the Summer before Heshu's death, the Yones' family returned to Iraqi Kurdistan for a holiday. Heshu was worried that her father would arrange a marriage for her, or prevent her from returning to the UK, she left a copy of her passport details with a friend and recorded a video diary whilst she was there. She later claimed that her father had forced her to undergo a virginity test which she allegedly failed, thus rendering herself unmarriageable within the Kurdish community; she claimed Abdalla held a gun to her head as a result. When the family returned to the UK, Heshu started making plans to run away from home. On 10 October 2002, Heshu's father received an anonymous letter at the PUK office, where he worked in a voluntary capacity. The letter, written in Kurdish, claimed that the \\"community\\" was aware that Heshu had a boyfriend, it referred to her as a \\"slut\\" who behaved like a \\"prostitute\\".  Murder  On 12 October 2002, after months of confrontation and physical violence towards his daughter, Abdalla Yones smashed his way into the bathroom where Heshu had barricaded herself. He stabbed her multiple times and cut her throat, before cutting his own throat and throwing himself off a balcony.  Investigation  Abdalla Yones spent several months in hospital recovering from his injuries following Heshu's death; throughout this time his wife and eldest son insisted that he was innocent of murder and tried to shield him from police questioning, claiming he was \\"mentally unstable\\". His son often visited him in hospital and it was during one such visit that they first told police that members of Al-Qaeda were responsible for Heshu's murder. They attempted to portray a harmonious family home life in the face of evidence to the contrary, such as the testimony of her friends, videos that Heshu had recorded, and a letter she had written to her father when planning to run away, in which she stated: The police also noted that members of the Kurdish community tried to protect him and help him cover-up Heshu's murder. It was claimed that witnesses were threatened and the community tried to raise money for his bail which, in any case, was declined due to \\"credible information\\" a plan was in place to help him flee. Metropolitan Police Commander, Andy Baker, later stated: \\"We are completely that some members of the community, or (Yones) friends, tried to assist him in (the) cover-up. It's not about one person committing the murder, it's about the few that acknowledge it and support it and are involved in it\\". After finally acknowledging that he had killed his daughter, Abdalla Yones tried to claim a defence of diminished responsibility, then provocation.  Guilty plea, sentencing and aftermath  Yones made a further attempt to take his own life while on remand, and days before his trial was due to start he changed his plea to guilty of murder. He claimed that the anonymous letter he'd received at the PUK office was the key trigger for his actions, it left him \\"disgusted\\" and \\"distressed\\" and put him in an \\"untenable position\\"; his daughter's actions left a \\"stain\\" on his family's honour. He was sentenced at the Old Bailey on 30 September 2003; he asked that the judge sentence him to death for what he'd done. In his sentencing remarks, Judge Denison referred to \\"a tragic story of irreconcilable cultural differences between traditional Kurdish values and the values of western society\\" and, when sentencing Yones to life in prison, noted \\"cultural differences\\" in mitigation when setting his minimum tariff of fourteen years. Conversely, following the conviction, Metropolitan Police Commander Andy Baker stated: \\"Violence in the name of culture will not be tolerated. Murder in the name of honour will be punished by the severest penalties available in law.\\"' Baker set up a specialist unit and taskforce to investigate honour-related crime; along with conducting research and flagging up frontline training requirements, reviews were conducted on murder files from 1993-2003 in an effort to identify those which may have been motivated by \\"honour\\". By June 2004, at least 13 reviewed cases had been identified as such.

From word to mouth through performing within the lineage of the jazz tradition, Koly was establishing himself as one of the young up and coming new drummers of the New York music scene and at which time met, heroes of his that he would integrate the bands of as an active member. Notably, Charnett Moffett, David Murray, Wallace Roney (whom he played most consistently with until his passing) . More so from a freelance angle, he also played as a sideman with Tarus mateen, Marc Cary, James hurt, Cheick Tidiane Seck, Awa Sangho (his mother), Florian Pellissier, Yoann Louslalot, Craig Harris, Darius Jones, Eddie Allen (jazz musician), Curtis Lundy, Brooklyn Raga Massive, Mwenso and the Shakes and Jana Herzen to name a few. Towards the end of 2017 up to February of 2019, Koly despite his young age gave a brief run at band leading whilst simultaneously freelancing. The project was named Kounadya and featured an array of young talents and some refined elders notably Brian Jackson. That he had previously worked along side Scott Tixier and Janna Herzen in the Charnett Moffett Band. In 2019 Koly was invited to join Wallace Roney's as an active permanent member of his band, and he did so until his tragic passing due to Covid on march 31st. He toured the Us and the world circuit with whom seemed to be one of his artistic guiding lights relating back to the relationship he held with Wallace's brother Antoine.

He was Filippo Grispigni‚Äôs student at the University of Rome and Silvio Ranieri‚Äôs disciple at the University of Bologna. Francesco Gianniti He was a professor of law and criminal procedure, a criminal lawyer and a criminal judge.  Thought  The cornerstone of his criminal-criminological thought, perfected over the years also on the basis of the experience gained in the exercise of judicial and forensic activity, is the idea that, for the purpose of effective action to combat crime, it is necessary to processing of an organic criminal policy program, which contribute, in addition to the penal legal disciplines (criminal law, criminal procedure and penal law), criminological experimental disciplines (in particular, psychology, sociology and criminal anthropology, forensic medicine and criminology, criminal statistics and scientific police)Francesco Gianniti, Le discipline giuridiche penalistiche e le discipline sperimentali criminologiche, in Giust. pen. , 2017, part II, cc. 672-689.

Pen., 1976, pp. 160-163.: * prevalence of the principle of prevention with respect to that of repression; * study of the crime no longer only as a legal entity, but as a human and social reality, moving from crime in the abstract to its author in concrete; * diagnosis of the personality and prognosis of the dangerousness of the subject who commits criminal activities, in this investigating what there is of \\"freedom\\", but also of \\"necessity\\" or \\"conditioning\\"; * flanking of the inductive-experimental method to the deductive-rational method in the study of the individual and social phenomena of crime; * affirmation of the rights of the accused before the arbitrators of the public authorities, accompanied by measures to protect the community and the person offended by the crime; * search for the multiplicity of factors of crime (as an individual phenomenon) and crime (as a social phenomenon); * determination of a plurality of remedies to counteract the endogenous and exogenous factors of the crime and the political and social factors of crime; * individualization of the sanction and of the treatment, in the sense that the sanction, in the phase of the penal trial, and the treatment, in that of the penal execution, must be adapted to the particular personality of each subject; * a tendency towards a broad decriminalization of minor offenses and provision of substitute sanctions and alternative measures to detention; * rehabilitative penitentiary treatment for the social reintegration of the condemned. The criminal-criminological thought of Francesco Gianniti is characterized by the tension to satisfy, with the aid of the bio-sociological disciplines of crime, the practical needs of the penalistic disciplines and the preference given to the interdisciplinary and comparative method in the study of criminal law, substantive and proceduralThe importance attributed to the methodological profile emerges in his most recent writings: Francesco Gianniti, Metodologia giuridica e dogmatica processuale penale, in Giust. pen., 1957, I , cc. 481-486.. In this regard, he argued that: \\"the science of criminal prosecution - similar to criminal science (but unlike the science of the civil trial) - does not end in juridical investigation (criminal procedural law), but extends to psychological investigation (psychology criminal and criminal judicial psychology) and is completed in the sociological survey (criminal process sociology and criminal judicial sociology) .The three surveys - while remaining autonomous for diversity of object, nature and method - are mutually complementary: law, psychology and sociology in fact, they give rise to inquiries that are necessarily different but inextricably linked in an interdisciplinary study of the criminal trial\\"Francesco Gianniti, Criminalistica, cit., p. 39; L'importanza della psicologia e della sociologia nel processo penale, in \\"Studi in memoria di Girolamo Bellavista\\", in Il Tommaso Natale, Palermo, 1977, p. 223.. From here, the particular conception that Francesco Gianniti had of the criminal lawyer, and, in particular, of the criminal judge. Precisely it was his conviction that: \\"the jurist (and especially the criminal lawyer, understood in a broad sense) can not limit himself to dogmatics, that is to the exclusive study of the content and scope of the juridical norms in force, making a systematic elaboration; but, anchoring the conceptual elements to human and social reality, it must also investigate concrete problems, referring to a particular society, urging and helping the legislator in the arduous task of implementing the most suitable reforms. Therefore, an interdisciplinary study is necessary to guide the legislative policy in the fields - inextricably linked - of the substantive and procedural criminal law, of the judicial and penitentiary system\\"Francesco Gianniti, Prospettive criminologiche e processo penale, Milan, Giuffr√®, (1977), III ed., 1984, p. VIII.. As for the criminal judge, \\"these - he wrote - in addition to being endowed with a serene and strong balance and a strict self-control power, he must possess not only the logical finesse of the jurist and the spiritual wealth of the humanist, but also the introspective acumen of the criminologist. He, therefore, must examine and know the personality of the individual delinquent (that particular murderer, that particular robber) in order to be able to concretely and completely judge him. ... As the doctor studies not only the disease, but that particular patient, because this represents \\"a clinical case\\", to which the most appropriate therapy must be practiced; so the judge, after having ascertained that a person has committed a crime, must study the unmistakable characteristics of the personality of that particular offender in order to impose on him the most appropriate sanction. If the culture of the criminal judge was limited to being exclusively juridical, criminal justice should deal only with the crime and not with the personality of its author. Ultimately, the criminal judge, in order to properly exercise his complex and delicate function, must assess not only the evidence concerning the crime (so-called judgment on the fact) but also the evidence concerning the suspect or accused person (so-called judgment on author of the fact)\\"Francesco Gianniti, Criminalistica , cit, pp. 186 - 187; l problema della specializzazione del personale per la prevenzione della criminalit√† (intervention carried out in the Conference of legal studies on the problems of prevention, held in Bologna, May 15-16, 1954), in Critica pen., 1954, pp. 284- 285..

In a speech at the international conference held in Lucca and Pisa in 1988, on the occasion of the centenary of the death of Carrara, he notedFrancesco Gianniti, Francesco Carrara e la Scuola positiva, cit., pp. 645-650 the significant convergence of the above two distinguished criminalists on the different function of law and criminal procedure, especially as the work of both was directed not to the systematic elaborations, but to the reform of the current penal legislation on the basis of new managerial criteria. According to Carrara, these were \\"the dogmas of supreme reason, which existed before all human laws and which must be observed by the penal legislator\\" ; according to Ferri, instead, they were the \\"criminal substitutes\\", that is, the reforms that must be carried out by means of laws concerning economic and political, civil and administrative, and which, in addition to favoring social evolution, tend to indirectly implement preventive defense against crime, especially opposing the factors social. Francesco Gianniti collaborated for many years with the magazine Positive SchoolThe magazine \\"Scuola Positiva\\", founded in 1891 by Enrico Ferri, was directed: from 1947 to 1956, by Filippo Grispigni and, from 1959 to 1972, by Silvio Ranieri. In the journal Francesco Gianniti published his first article. One of his articles also appeared in the latest issue of the magazine.. Well aware of the \\"irrevocable civil and juridical conquests of the classical School\\" - which he considered mainly represented, as well as by Carrara, Pellegrino Rossi and Enrico Pessina - he recognized himself in the Positive School, which was anticipated by Gian Domenico Romagnosi, Carlo Cattaneo and Giovanni BovioFrancesco Gianniti, La problematica penale nel saggio critico di Giovanni Bovio, in Scuola pos., 1972, p. 469. and represented mainly by Ferri, Cesare Lombroso and Raffaele Garofalo. However, he did not share either the denial of free will, supported by Ferri, nor the importance attributed by Lombroso to the somatic factors in the causal explanation of the criminal phenomenonFrancesco Gianniti, Criminalistica , cit., pp. 27 and 34; cfr. also pp. 199-202.. He attributed the merit to the Positive SchoolFrancesco Gianniti, Criminalistica , cit., pp. 139 and 213; Prospettive criminologiche e processo penale, cit., pp. 59 and 92.: to have supported the need to resort to prevention before repression, being the former much more effective than the second; to have moved the fulcrum of the penal law from the crime to the author of the criminal conduct, giving life and impulse to the criminological disciplines; to have affirmed the educational finalism of the penalty, anticipating a principle later consecrated in art. 27 paragraph 3 of the Constitution. He argued that the prevention measures (the so-called criminal substitutes of Ferri) are a more effective means of social defense than penalties in the fight against crime: \\"a provident civil and administrative legislation \\" can modify, more effectively than penalties, \\"the factors social, economic and political, which prepare and facilitate crime\\"Francesco Gianniti, Prospettive criminologiche e processo penale, cit., p. 165; Criminalistica, cit., pp. 138, 206-212; L'opera scientifica di Silvio Ranieri e problemi attuali di politica criminale, cit., pp. 160-161; Le misure di prevenzione nelle prospettive positiviste e nella loro realizzazione normativa (communication carried out in the IX Study Conference \\"Enrico de Nicola\\", held in Alghero, 26-28 April 1974), in Le misure di prevenzione, Milan, Giuffr√®, 1975, pp. 162-167.. And it was persuaded that the prediction of a plurality of sanctions, the imposition of a punishment adequate to the personality of the subject and a penitentiary treatment adapted to the personality of the condemned person were consistent with the spirit and values of the Constitution.

Biography  He was born of Pasquale Gianniti (1889 - 1976) and Maria Camerino (1891 - 1952). In the family of origin there had been convinced supporters of the Unification of Italy, who had played an active role during the Risorgimento. In particular, the great-grandfather Pasquale Gianniti (1830 - 1884), a doctor in law, in 1857, under the Bourbon government, had been restricted to the prisons of Oriolo for subversive activityState Archives of Cosenza, Political Processes 1835/78, n. 142, vol. 1, p. 27 and ss., while his younger brother, Luigi Gianniti (1849 - 1870), had been Sergeant Major of the 40th Infantry Regiment and had fallen to Porta Pia on 20 September 1870. He received his first training in Calabria , where he attended, in the years 1927 - 1932, the primary school in Oriolo, and then, in the years 1933-1940, the Classical High School Bernardino Telesio of Cosenza, where he was a pupil, among others, of Don Luigi Nicoletti. In October 1940, he enrolled in the Faculty of Law of the University of Rome. In 1943 he won the \\"Nicola Zanotti\\"Rectoral Decree of Assignment 2 April 1943 award, because, in addition to having obtained the highest marks and praise in the commercial law exam with the professor Alberto Asquini, he presented the best average grade in the Faculty of Law. On July 28, 1945 he graduated with honors, discussing with the professor Filippo Grispigni the thesis in criminal law on \\"The legitimacy of resistance to arbitrary acts of the Authority\\". In the years immediately following the degree date two of his historical-juridical writings, which bear witness to his passion for history and sympathy for Mazzini's thought: \\"The Polish question at the Congress of Vienna in 1815\\" (1946) and \\"La Repubblica Romana of 1849\\" (1947); as well as the \\"Ricordi Coriglianesi\\" (1950), which contain a dozen poems, with an autobiographical backgroundAll three of the aforementioned youth writings have been collected in the volume of Antonio Benvenuto, Francesco Gianniti. Una vita in tre toghe, Corigliano Calabro, 2013, p. 19 et seq., p. 39 et seq., p. 149 and ss.. On 20 December 1952 he met Caterina De Santis in Cosenza - daughter of Agostino De Santis, a doctor and honorary inspector of antiquities in Francavilla Marittima , and of Francesca Fasanella Masci, descendant of an old family - who then married on 13 June 1954 and with whom he had three children: Maria Giulia (1955), Daniela (1957) and Pasquale (1961)Antonio Benvenuto, Francesco Gianniti. Una vita in tre toghe, cit., p. 253: \\"The family has always been my strength - he left written - without the love and support of my family members I could not have occupied myself, full time, of my work, before a magistrate and, later, a university professor and lawyer \\".. His professional life - as a lawyer, judge and university professor - developed between Rome, Corigliano Calabro and Bologna, but always maintained a strong bond with the native village of Oriolo, where he used to spend his summer holidays, gathering relatives and friends and cultivating his studies.  Forensic activity  In 1947 he obtained the forensic qualification at the Court of Appeal of Rome, where he carried out professional activities up to the date of entry into the judiciary. In the years 1965-1985, left the judiciary, resumed to practice the criminal activity in the criminal sector, as a lawyer authorized to practice before the Court of CassationAntonio Benvenuto, Francesco Gianniti. Una vita in tre toghe, cit., P. 239, where, in note 30, are reported the words pronounced by Francesco Gianniti, in the guise of criminal lawyer, on the occasion of the first hearing that he held as a defender before magistrates of the Court of Bologna, his former colleagues: \\" the lawyer a criminalist, in his defense, from a substantial point of view, he should only point out and illustrate the elements that the magistrate must make based on his sentence, in the case that he recognizes the defense's thesis; while, from a formal point of view, it should constantly be inspired by the canons of clarity and synthesis, just as sober and crystalline must be the motivation of the sentence\\".. In 1973, in particular, he defended in Cassation the producer of the film \\"Last tango in Paris\\" Alberto Grimaldi and the director Bernardo Bertolucci, acquitted by the Court of Bologna (sentence 2 February 1973) but condemned by the Court of Appeal of Bologna (sentence 4 June 1973) for competition in an obscene show. The Court of Cassation, in accepting the appeal, annulled the sentence with a reference to another section of the Court of Appeal of Bologna. Against the sentence handed down in the adjudication judgment on September 26, 1974, he filed new grounds for appeal to the Supreme Court. In 1973, Francesco Gianniti defended Pier Paolo Pasolini - who had been acquitted by the Court of Benevento (ruling October 20, 1972) from the indictment of competition in an obscene show for the film \\"The Canterbury Tales\\" - before the Court of Appeal of Naples , which confirmed (sentence 2 July 1973) the decision of acquittal delivered at first instance. Following an appeal by the public prosecutor, he was the defender, together with the attorney professor Alfredo De Marsico, of the director Pier Paolo Pasolini and of the producer Alberto Grimaldi, in the judgment for Cassation. In both judgments, he supported the thesis that the provisions of art. 529 paragraph 2 of the Italian Civil Code pen. (\\"The work of art is not considered obscene\\"), correctly interpreted, was applicable to the aforementioned films due to the presence, in both, of \\"artistic merits\\", which had taken care to identify and highlight and which had been recognized by a large part of the artistic, national and foreign criticism.  Judicial activity  On 11 March 1948 he entered the judiciary as \\"in charge of judicial functions \\", as the winner of the competition for titles issued with d.l.lgt. April 30, 1946. He served as a magistrate in Corigliano Calabro from 15 September 1948 to 15 October 1950. In 1950 he was among the first to pass the examination for judicial additionMinistry of Grace and Justice, Official Bulletin of December 16, 1951, p. 687., issued by Ministerial Decree of 23 March 1950. He moved to Bologna , where he worked: the functions of Pretore (from October 28, 1950 to December 21, 1951), of investigating judge of the Criminal Court (from December 1951 to December 1955), of judge of the first penal section of the Court and of the Court of Assizes of Bologna (from January 1956 to October 1959) and of judge of the second civil section of the Court of Bologna (from October 1959 to December 31, 1962).  Didactic and scientific activity  In November 1950, when he was a criminal magistrate in Bologna, he was introduced by Professor Filippo Grispigni to Professor Silvio RanieriThe episode is told in the article L'opera scientifica di Silvio Ranieri e problemi attuali di politica criminale, cit., where, on p. 153, Francesco Gianniti also describes the relationship between his two masters, both of whom have become directors of the magazine Scuola Positiva, and, on the latter's proposal, he was appointed voluntary assistant of criminal law at the University of Bologna and began educational and scientific activity. To cultivate this activity was also encouraged by the professor Ernesto Battaglini, who would become judge of the Constitutional Court and who invited him to publish studies and articles in the journal Criminal Justice. In 1959 he published his first monograph in criminal law, \\"I reati della stessa indole\\" (The crimes of the same nature), in which he carried out a systematic reconstruction of this conceptual category, and, facing the problem of recidivism, claimed that the nature of the crimes is generally, but not necessarily, a symptom of a higher capacity to commit delinquency. On March 17, 1961 he unanimously obtained the qualification for \\"free education\\" in criminal lawMinistry of Education, Ordinary Supplement to the Official Bulletin, 19 July 1962, Part II, p. 26. The teaching was conferred on him by Ministerial Decree of 27 May 1961 and definitively confirmed by Ministerial Decree of 10 October 1966. The Commission, presided over by Professor Alfredo De Marsico , was composed of professors Giuseppe Bettiol, Silvio Ranieri, Giuliano Vassalli and Francesco Chiarotti.. In 1962, being assistant professor of criminal law at the University of Bologna, he won the national competition for a post of ordinary criminal law assistant in the same UniversityMinistry of Education, Official Bulletin, Part II, May 16, 1963 n. 20. The Commission, chaired by Professor Silvio Ranieri, was composed of professors Ferruccio Pergolesi and Tito Carnacini and came to be in the alternative whether to continue the activity in the magistracy or pass to the university career. The passion for scientific research prevailed in him and the attraction of being able to become one day a university chair, which for him was a symbol of intellectual nobility. So it was that on 1 February 1963 he left the judiciary to embark on a university career, which he covered entirely at the University of Bologna. In the three academic years of 1963-1966 he was a professor in charge of criminal law. The study on \\"L'oggetto materiale del reato\\" (The material object of the crime) dates back to those years, published in 1966, in which he claimed that this element, on the one hand, \\"assumes particular importance in the general theory of crime, as it arises in numerous crimes such as constitutive element and in many others as an aggravating circumstance, while often it appears as a distinctive or specializing element of a crime compared to another \\"; and, on the other, \\"represents a valid coefficient for the scientific elaboration of the special part ... through the study of all the criminal figures who assume it, as an element, essential or accessory, in their structure\\". In the following three years 1967-1970 he was a professor in charge of institutions of law and criminal procedure in the Faculty of Political Sciences of the University of Bologna. In 1970 he published the volume \\"Studi sulla corruzione del pubblico ufficiale\\" (Studies on the corruption of the public official) in which three previous writings were collected: in the first, he determined the concept of utility, as a general concept of special part, on the basis of the comparative examination of the various provisions that provide; in the second he illustrated the common elements and the differential characteristics between the German criminal law and the Italian criminal law on corruption; in the third he faced the problem of corruption of the public official in the exercise of powers characterized by administrative discretion. In 1972 he won the national competition for a post of full professor in the penalistic disciplines at the Faculty of Law of the University of BolognaThe Commission, chaired by professor Cesare Pedrazzi , was composed of professors Giuseppe De Luca, Delfino Siracusano, Franco Bricola, Bruno Pannain. In the report of January 28, 1972 - reported in Antonio Benvenuto, Francesco Gianniti. Una vita in tre toghe, cit., p. 238 note 25 - the Commission considered ¬´worthy of particular consideration is the most recent monograph \\"Studies on the corruption of the public official\\", which examines problems of great relevance with happy interpretation, also enhancing the experience of foreign legal systems and achieving balanced and appreciable results. In the unanimous opinion of the Commission this monograph provides a series of useful and original contributions to the problem of corruption crimes\\". and came to be in the alternative between continuing the study and teaching of criminal law or passing to the study and teaching the criminal procedure. He opted for the second alternative: \\"The change of subject - he left written - made me think of the university doctor who, after having spent several years in medical clinic, suddenly goes to the surgical clinic\\"Antonio Benvenuto, Francesco Gianniti. Una vita in tre toghe, cit., p. 253.. His first monographs of criminal procedure date back to the 1970s: \\"Prospettive criminologiche e processo penale\\" (Criminological Perspectives and Criminal Process), published in 1977, in which he supported the necessity of developing an organic program of criminal policy (in the substantive, procedural and execution fields of the pena), as well as the examination of the personality of the offender in the criminal trial (before, during and after the trial phase); and \\"Controversie in tema di giudizio direttissimo\\" (Controversies in the matter of a very direct judgment), published in 1979, in which he examined this special judgment, framing it as a typical example of an accusatory process in the predominantly inquisitorial system of the then current code of procedure. From November 1, 1973 to October 31, 1991 he held the chair of criminal procedure at the Faculty of Law of the University of Bologna: first as an extraordinary professor and then, since 1978, as an ordinary professorThe Selection Committee for the appointment of professor of criminal procedure, composed of professors Giuseppe Guarnieri (Chairman), Nicola Carulli and Giovanni Tranchina (secretary), in the report of April, 24 1979 - reported in Antonio Benvenuto, Francesco Gianniti. Una vita in tre toghe, cit., pp. 239-240 note 33 - underlined the importance of the study \\"The importance of psychology and of sociology in the penal process\\", observing that in this writing: ¬´the Author - taking up a theme already explored in the monograph \\"Criminological Perspectives and Criminal Process\\", in which he intended to enhance the contribution made by criminological positivism to the evolution of criminal procedural law - demonstrates knowledge of the sociological and psychological sciences he considers necessary for a complete and in-depth study of the criminal process. The work, even if brief and concise, highlights, with a confidence revealing the faith in the exposed ideas, a current problem as well as an interesting one¬ª, and concluded by expressing ¬´unanimous a fully favorable judgment on the scientific activity of the candidate¬ª.. As the holder of the penal procedure, in addition to university courses, he held: a) annual courses of practice in criminal proceedings at the \\"Enrico Redenti\\" forensic application institute of Bologna (1973-1991); b) annual courses of lessons, first of all on \\"criminal trial and administrative process\\" and then on \\"crimes against public administration\\" at the School of specialization in administrative sciences in Bologna (1977-1988); c) annual lecture courses on \\"penitentiary legal medicine\\", on \\"criminological medicine\\" and, finally, on \\"criminal legal medicine\\" to graduates in medicine and surgery at the School of specialization in forensic medicine of the University of Bologna (1978- 1991). The monographs date back to the 1980s: \\"Introduzione allo studio interdisciplinare del processo penale\\" (Introduction to the interdisciplinary study of the criminal process), published in 1986, in which he examined the relations that the science of the criminal process presents with the other branches of the legal system; and \\"I rapporti tra processo civile e processo penale\\" (Relations between the civil process and the criminal trial), published in 1988, in which, continuing the previous work, it carried out a comparative examination between various institutions and procedural concepts, both civil and criminal. As a professor of criminal procedure, he was the promoter, with his collaborators, of a working method, based on a collegial confrontation, characterized by periodic meetings, in which there was talk of scientific questions, organization of teaching or other initiatives related to teaching activity. And, in relations with the students, he pursued three objectives: to transform, at least in part, the teaching classes in \\"interviews with the students\\"; to accompany the students of each course, at least once, to the Court and the Court of Appeals to attend the criminal hearings and then draw reasons for reflection in class on the complex relations between criminal law, criminal trial and judicial policy; and finally the goal of encouraging the most willing students to become active subjects of the lessons, inviting them to relate to the content of the research carried outRenzo Orlandi, Ricordo di Francesco Gianniti, in Giust. pen., 2017, part I, cc. 289-290; Antonio Benvenuto, Francesco Gianniti. Una vita in tre toghe, cit., p. 200: \\"In this way the willing students: they deepened the matter and became passionate about it; they learned to do library research; they explained the matters dealt with and the problems solved in writing from the chair to the colleagues; they learned to speak in public, provoking the emulation of their colleagues; they were rewarded in the oral exam with a higher grade or with honors; acquired the necessary experience for the preparation of the degree thesis and the first publications; they were candidates to pass the written and oral tests of public competitions\\".. In 1985 he gave birth to a post-graduate school in Bologna (called Centro Studi Address Magistratura Avvocatura), which he continued until 2009. In that school, over the years, several hundred young graduates prepared for the written tests of the competition for the judiciary and the examination for the qualification for the legal profession. Expression of this activity were the volumes \\"Guida all'esame per avvocato\\" (Guide for the exam for lawyer ) (Giuffr√®, 2006) and \\"Guida al concorso per magistrato ordinario\\" (Guide to the competition for ordinary magistrate) (Cedam, 2008). Some of the methodological advice, which he used to impart to his students, is now, by his will, fully and freely available on the webFrancesco Gianniti, Consigli e suggerimenti per la preparazione al concorso per magistrato ordinario, May 2017. Consigli e suggerimenti per la preparazione all'esame di avvocato, Bologna, May 2017. Both available on Academia.edu. The pieces of advice Prof. Gianniti used to give his students have been the subject of a Symposium for trainees at the Corte di Cassazione and Procura Generale with the title: ‚ÄúThe access to law professions: instructions for the use‚Äù, which took place on 29 November 2019 and have been published in the section: ‚Äúevents, symposia and seminars‚Äù of the Corte di Cassazione website . On October 31, 1996 he was placed \\"at rest\\" as an ordinary professor, but continued his teaching and scientific activities. As a teacher, he continued to teach law and criminal procedure within the CSIMA School until 2009. From a scientific point of view, he carried out further studies on the criminal trial and its relations with the criminological disciplines. The monograph \\"Aspetti problematici del processo penale\\" (Problematic aspects of the criminal trial) dates back to 1997, highlighting the positive and negative aspects of the criminal trial, with particular reference to the \\"instructive powers\\" of the public prosecutor and to alternative \\"inquisitorial\\" rites, and examined the \\"derogations\\" to the trial trial and to the parts process. In 2007, with the monograph \\"Sistema penale e problemi criminologici\\" (Criminal System and Criminological Problems), illustrated the relationships between criminal law, criminal procedural law and criminal disciplines; and carried out, with the comparative method, topics of general and special part of the criminal law. Finally, in 2011, now ninety years old, he published the latest monograph, \\"Criminalistica\\" (Criminalistic), in which he argued that \\"to study, with deductive-rational method, the offense as a legal entity must be accompanied by the study, with experimental inductive method, of the crime as human and social reality, so that, on the one hand, the diagnosis of the personality and the prognosis of the dangerousness of the subject that delinque and, secondly, the social defense, as protection of the community and of the injured person, take on importance\\".

Honors and awards  He was: since 1968, Member of Honor of the Society of Criminal Law and Criminology of Buenos Aires ; since 1977, corresponding member of the Cosentina Academy Bernardino Telesio; from 1993 to 2005, Magistrate for the judgment of the union action of the Republic of San MarinoGreat and General Council of the Republic of San Marino, nomination resolutions of 17/2/1993, 15/12/1998 and 29/10/2001, adopted pursuant to art. 14 paragraph 9 of the law 28/10/1992 n. 83.. In 2013, in his honor, the book Francesco Gianniti. Una vita in tre toghe (Francesco Gianniti - A life in three togas) was published by Antonio Benvenuto (presented in Corigliano on June 29, 2013 during a conference on Avvocatura e Magistratura, organized by the Civil Chamber of Rossano). The author - based on an accurate historical research - in the preface draws the profile of Francesco Gianniti, when he was Pretore in Corigliano (1948-1950), as a young man of vast culture, juridical and humanistic, and warm humanity; while, in the appendix, it outlines the subsequent existential path, characterized by the centrality of the family and by the passion for work, understood as an opportunity to serve others. The Author writes: \\"The title is inspired by the many professional experiences - as Magistrate, Lawyer and University Professor - of this son of Calabria, who, with his multi-faceted professional activity, has honored the territory of Sibaritide\\".

It was used from March 1933 to July 1934 and is now a memorial site.  History  The Osthofen concentration camp's official history begins with a decree by the State Commissar for the Police in Hesse, Werner Best, on 1 May 1933. Anyone arrested for political reasons in Hesse for more than a week or expected to be imprisoned for more than a week was ordered to be sent to Osthofen. However, the camp had already been in operation for longer. After the 28 February 1933 Reichstag Fire Decree, civil liberties in Germany became restricted, and large numbers of Communists were arrested. On 6 March, the empty former paper factory in Ziegelh√ºttenweg was confiscated from its legal owner, Jewish businessman Karl Joehlinger. Large groups of prisoners began to be sent to the camp from 13 March 1933, with most of the early prisoners Communists or Social Democrats. From summer of 1933, also non-political Jews, Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh-Day Adventists and others were imprisoned. The camp was closed in July 1934 as a result of a centralisation of the concentration camps directed by Heinrich Himmler, and the 13 last prisoners were moved to other camps and prisons including Dachau.  Administration and guards  The camp was under the direction of the Hesse Political Police, which later became part of the Gestapo. , a SS and the local Osthofen Nazi Party chairman, was made honorary camp leader on orders of Werner Best. Camp doctor was , who declared every single new arrival healthy and medically fit for imprisonment even if they had been mistreated. The camp guards were at first drawn mostly from local SA and SS men turned auxiliary police (95 SA and 99 SS, of which 55 served each day) but the SA were replaced by SS in autumn of 1933, significantly worsening conditions for the prisoners. None of the guards were prosecuted for their actions in the camp after 1945. The existence of the concentration camp was not a secret, and was at the time widely commented on in the press, both locally and internationally. The New York Times reported on the camp and its imprisonment of Jews in August 1933. The camp sign, painted on the building in large letters, was clearly visible from passing trains.  Conditions in the camp  alt=A large empty concrete hall with support pillars Osthofen usually held around 200 prisoners at a time, and approximately 3,000 people were imprisoned there over the existence of the camp, usually for two to six weeks, but ranging from one week to one year. The prisoners were used as unpaid labourers, often for the benefit of D'Angelo or other party members. Although living conditions and hygiene were extremely primitive (at first, prisoners had to sleep on the concrete floor), none of the inmates died in the camp, but many became sick and contracted chronic urinary tract diseases. The prisoners were routinely abused and humiliated, especially Jews. For example, Ernst Katz was severely beaten on Yom Kippur and forced to eat pork after he regained consciousness. The SPD politician Carlo Mierendorff was forced to straighten nails that his fellow prisoners had to bend. In a nearby \\"Camp II\\", which was used for aggravated detention, prisoners had to spend the nights in wire cages, with lights on that made sleep difficult.  Site history and legacy  Furniture factory lettering on the wall of the memorial site The main building was erected in 1872 as a paper factory owned by Gustav Rumpel. In 1908, it was extended with another factory hall, under the ownership of Joseph Kahn. The paper factory was closed in the 1930s. After the use as a concentration camp, it became a furniture factory from 1936 to 1976. Former prisoners, supported by the Union of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime, started efforts to commemorate the history in 1972, which was at the time opposed by locals. A first memorial plaque was installed in 1978. A first book with \\"materials about an almost forgotten concentration camp\\" was compiled in 1979 by former Buchenwald detainee . After further activist involvement by the youth wing of the German Trade Union Confederation and others, the camp building became a protected monument in 1989. The state of Rhineland-Palatinate bought the site in 1991 and turned it into a memorial, which was completed in 2004.  Literary adaptation  In her 1942 novel The Seventh Cross (adapted as a film in 1944), Anna Seghers describes a fictitious \\"Westhofen\\" concentration camp located in the same area. Seghers had met Max Tschornicki, one of the two inmates who escaped from Osthofen, in Paris. While the novel has been called a \\"memorial\\" to the Osthofen inmates and realistically describes the political persecution in Rhenish Hesse, the plot of The Seventh Cross, set in 1937, is inspired by an escape from Sachsenhausen concentration camp.  Notable prisoners  *Max Dienemann, German rabbi *, German SPD politician and member of parliament, imprisoned from 21 June 1933. *Max Tschornicki, German Jewish lawyer and resistance member, escaped from the camp on 3 July 1933.

She used the pseudonym L√≠lia da Fonseca in her writing. She was the first woman to join a candidate list in legislative elections for Portugal's Assembly of the Republic, in 1957.  Biography  Maria Valente da Fonseca was born in 1906 in Benguela, Angola, to an Angolan mother and European father. She moved to Portugal when she was very young and studied at the Liceu Infanta D. Maria in Coimbra and the Escola Carolina Mich√§elis in Porto. She then returned to Angola, settling in Luanda, where she worked as a journalist for the newspaper A Prov√≠ncia de Angola. She continued to write for the publication later in her life, when she returned to Portugal. Her first novel, Panguila, was published in 1944 under the name L√≠lia da Fonseca. The book paints a faithful portrait of society in colonial Benguela at the time. In November 1945, she signed a manifesto of intellectuals protesting against \\"all kinds of limitations\\" placed on intellectual activity by the regime. She was also involved in anti-war efforts, signing the Manifesto Pela Paz entre as Na√ß√µes (\\"For Peace Among Nations\\"). In 1950, she founded the magazine Jornal-Magazine da Mulher (\\"Women's Newsmagazine\\") in Lisbon, and she served as its editor until the last issue, in 1956. She also founded the Suplemento Liter√°rio M√£os de Fada: Revista de lavores femininos (\\"Fairy Hands Literary Supplement: Magazine of Women's Labor\\") and worked on the feminist magazine Os Nossos Filhos (\\"Our Children\\"), which offered an alternative educational curriculum in opposition to the Estado Novo regime's. In 1957 she was an opposition candidate in legislative elections for Portugal's Assembly of the Republic, becoming the first woman named to an electoral list. Fonseca went on to found a puppetry group, the Teatro de Fantoches de Branca Flor. The group performed in schools, at summer camps, in poor neighborhoods on the outskirts of Lisbon, and in provincial theaters. It also represented Portugal in international puppetry festivals. Fonseca wrote various performance pieces for the group, some of which were also broadcast via radio on Emissora Nacional, the national broadcaster. She received a scholarship from the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation that allowed her to visit puppet theaters in various countries. She published numerous literary works dealing with the role of women in society, as well as novels and children's literature. She received several awards for her work from the Emissora Nacional.

History The River Foss was dammed in York, on the orders of William the Conqueror, to create a large fishpond, with a marsh extending to its east. Between the two, they covered much of the land over which Piccadilly now runs. The pool gradually decreased in area, and by 1610, a lane had become established, along the southern part of what is now Piccadilly. The river was canalised in 1792, allowing greater use of the area, and in about 1840, the street was widened, now reaching as far north as Dixon Lane. At this time, it was renamed, after Piccadilly in London, but due to its relative isolation from the rest of the city, it did not attract the hoped-for large residential properties. Instead, by the early 20th-century, the street was mostly industrial, with a sawmill and brewery alongside builders' and coal merchants. In 1912, the street was again extended north. Piccadilly Bridge was constructed across the Foss, and some timber-framed buildings facing Pavement were demolished. The extension allowed York Corporation Tramways to construct a new depot on the street, and trams ran along its length. The street became increasingly known for shopping and entertainment, with the Regal Cinema opening in the 1930s, although it closed in 1959. Further out, there were car showroom and garages. In 1931, the tram depot became the Airspeed aeroplane factory. By the 2010s, the City of York Council noted that \\"although it contains offices, apartments and hotels, Piccadilly is not a popular destination since it has little to offer in the way of retail or visitor attractions\\". As of 2020, several new hotels are under construction on the street. Layout and architecture Piccadilly Bridge, seen from the east The street now runs south, from the junction of Parliament Street, Pavement, High Ousegate and Coppergate, over the Ouse, to end on the city's inner ring road, where Tower Street meets Fishergate. Several roads lead off to the east: Merchantgate, Dennis Street, St Denys Road, Mill Street, and Lead Mill Lane. Listed buildings on the street include Piccadilly Chambers and the rear of the Merchant Adventurers' Hall. The former White Swan Hotel largely dates from 1912, but contains some 18th-century structure, including a staircase. The northern and central parts of the street is lined with shops, some of which form part of the Coppergate Shopping Centre. The Spark:York development of converted shipping containers is on the central part of the street, opposite the former Banana Warehouse. This, and the former tram depot, demolished in 2015, were described by the City of York Council as \\"the only buildings of merit\\" in the area. The southern part of the street is dominated by office blocks, including Ryedale House, described by Nickolaus Pevsner as \\"deplorable\\", and Piccadilly House, described as \\"far superior\\". At the southern end of the street lies the Fishergate Postern Tower, part of the York City Walls.

She was a large cruiser submarine displacing 2,135 tons that entered service in 1929 and served in the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II. During the latter conflict she operated in support of the attack on Pearl Harbor, conducted anti-shipping patrols in the Indian Ocean, supported the Indian Ocean raid, and took part in the Aleutian Islands campaign, Guadalcanal campaign, and New Guinea campaign before she was sunk in December 1942. Construction and commissioning Built by Kawasaki at Kobe, Japan, I-4 was laid down on 17 April 1926. She was launched on 22 May 1928 and was completed and commissioned on 24 December 1929. Service history=Early service Upon commissioning, I-4 was attached to the Yokosuka Naval District, assigned to Submarine Division 7 in Submarine Squadron 2 in the 2nd Fleet. On 1 August 1930, she was reassigned to Submarine Division 8. She was off Kyushu near the Mishima Islands taking part in a exercise in which a group of submarines practiced a mock combined attack on a line of zigzagging battleships on 14 June 1932 when she unexpectedly surfaced in front of the battleships. The battleship , making , took evasive action at the last minute and managed to avoid a direct collision with the stationary I-4, although Hy≈´ga suffered minor damage to her hull plating when her bow grazed I-4‚Ä≤s hull. Second Sino-Japanese War On 7 July 1937 the first day of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident took place, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War. In September 1937 Submarine Squadron 1 was reassigned to the 3rd Fleet,Boyd and Yoshida, p. 54. which in turn was subordinated to the China Area Fleet for service in Chinese waters. The squadron, consisting of I-4 and her sister ships , , , , and , deployed to a base at Hong Kong with the submarine tenders and in September 1937. From Hong Kong, the submarines began operations in support of a Japanese blockade of China and patrols of China‚Ä≤s central and southern coast. From 21 to 23 August 1937, all six submarines of Submarine Squadron 1 operated in the East China Sea as distant cover for an operation in which the battleships , , , and and the light cruiser ferried troops from Tadotsu, Japan, to Shanghai, China. Submarine Squadron 1 was based at Hong Kong until the autumn of 1938. In an effort to reduce international tensions over the conflict in China, Japan withdrew its submarines from Chinese waters in December 1938. 1938‚Äì1941 Submarine Squadron 2 was resubordinated to the 6th Fleet on 15 November 1940. On 7 January 1941, I-4 became flagship of Submarine Division 8. On 10 November 1941 ‚Äî by which time I-4, I-5, I-6, and the submarine made up Submarine Division 8 in Submarine Squadron 2 in the 6th Fleet, with I-7 serving as squadron flagship ‚Äî the commander of the 6th Fleet, Vice Admiral Mitsumi Shimizu, gathered the commanding officers of the fleet‚Ä≤s submarines together for a meeting aboard his flagship, the light cruiser , which was anchored in Saeki Bay. Shimizu briefed them on the upcoming attack on Pearl Harbor, which would bring Japan and the United States into World War II. As the Imperial Japanese Navy began to deploy for the upcoming conflict in the Pacific, I-4, I-5, I-6, and I-7 got underway from Yokosuka on 16 November 1941, bound for the Hawaiian Islands. The submarines received the message \\"Climb Mount Niitaka 1208\\" () from the Combined Fleet on 2 December 1941, indicating that war with the Allies would commence on 8 December 1941 Japan time, which was on 7 December 1941 on the other side of the International Date Line in Hawaii. World War IIFirst war patrol= On 7 December 1941, the submarines of Submarine Squadron 2 took up patrol stations across a stretch of the Pacific Ocean from northeast to northwest of Oahu, with I-4‚Ä≤s patrol area adjacent to that of I-6. The submarines had orders to conduct reconnaissance in the area and attack any ships which sortied from Pearl Harbor during or after the attack, which occurred that morning. At around 03:55 on 14 December 1941, I-4 hit the starboard side of the Norwegian merchant ship H≈≥egh Merchant ‚Äî which had been on a voyage from San Francisco, California, to Manila in the Philippines with 7,500 tons of general cargo including 100 tons of explosives and when the war broke out and had been diverted to Honolulu, Hawaii ‚Äî with a torpedo east-northeast of Makapu ªu Point, Oahu. H≈≥egh Merchant caught fire, and at around 04:05 I-4 fired another torpedo which hit her near the same place as the first. H≈≥egh Merchant sank at 05:33, and the United States Navy destroyer minesweeper rescued her passengers and crew. Oil barrels from H≈≥egh Merchant‚Ä≤s cargo drifted ashore on Kauai a number of days later. On 9 January 1942, I-4 was ordered to divert from her patrol and search for the United States Navy aircraft carrier , which the submarine had sighted, but she did not find Lexington. She arrived at Kwajalein on 22 January 1942, then got back underway on 24 January 1942 bound for Yokosuka, which she reached on 2 February 1942. =Second war patrol= While I-4 was at Yokosuka, Submarine Squadron 2 ‚Äî consisting of I-1, I-2, I-3, I-4, I-6, and the squadron flagship, I-7 ‚Äî was assigned to the Dutch East Indies Invasion Force on 8 February 1942. Accordingly, I-4 departed Yokosuka on 12 February 1942 bound for Palau, where she arrived on 16 February 1942, then got back underway on 17 February bound for the Netherlands East Indies. She arrived at Staring Bay on the Southeast Peninsula of Celebes just southeast of Kendari on 22 February 1942, then put back to sea on 23 February, heading for the Indian Ocean south of Java, where she was to conduct her second war patrol. At about 16:15 on 28 February 1942, I-4 sank an unidentified Allied steamship ‚Äî sometimes identified as Singapore-based merchant steamer , although Ban Ho Guan may have not been in the area at the time ‚Äî in the Indian Ocean southwest of Bali. She bombarded the Cocos Islands on 3 March, and concluded her patrol with her arrival at Penang in Japanese- occupied British Malaya at 12:50 Japan Standard Time on 8 March 1942. =Third war patrol= Orders arrived from the headquarters of the Combined Fleet for all the submarines of Submarine Squadron 2 except for I-1 to conduct reconnaissance operations along the coast of Ceylon and western coast of India in preparation for Operation C, the upcoming Indian Ocean raid by the aircraft carriers of the Combined Fleet‚Ä≤s Mobile Force. Accordingly, I-4 departed Penang on 28 March 1942 with the commander of Submarine Division 8 embarked and with orders to conduct a reconnaissance in the Indian Ocean of Eight Degree Channel and the waters off Colombo, Ceylon. At the western entrance of Eight Degree Channel at about 15:55 on 6 April 1942 ‚Äî the day after Japanese carrier planes raided Colombo ‚Äî I-4 fired two Type 96 torpedoes at the American 6,617-ton steamer , which was on a voyage from Suez, Egypt, to Colombo. Washingtonian sighted one of the torpedoes approaching on her port side at a distance of and began a slow turn in an attempt to avoid it, but both torpedoes hit, setting Washingtonian‚Ä≤s fuel tanks on fire. Fire soon engulfed the ship, and she had taken on a 25-degree list to port when her crew of 29 and two passengers abandoned ship at 16:05. Washingtonian eventually sank. On 10 April 1942 after 01:00, I-4 surfaced off Colombo in the vicinity of and opened fire with both of her deck guns on a 200-ton Maldivian buggalow, firing fourteen rounds and heavily damaging the vessel. I-4‚Ä≤s patrol ended with her arrival at Singapore on 16 April 1942. She departed Singapore on 21 April 1942 to head for Yokosuka, which she reached on 1 May 1942. =Fourth war patrol= While I-4 was at Yokosuka, the Aleutian Islands campaign began on 3‚Äì4 June 1942 with a Japanese air raid on Dutch Harbor, Alaska, followed quickly by the unopposed Japanese occupation in the Aleutian Islands of Attu on 5 June and Kiska on 7 June 1942. On 10 June 1942, I-1, I-2, I-3, I-4, I-5, I-6, and I-7 were reassigned to the Northern Force for duty in the Aleutians, and on 11 June 1942 I-4 set out for Aleutian waters in company with I-1, I-2, I-3, and I-7 to begin her fourth war patrol. On 20 June 1942, I-1, I-2, and I-4 joined the \\"K\\" patrol line in the North Pacific Ocean between and . I-4 remained on the patrol line until 3 July 1942. On 20 July 1942, she was reassigned to the Advance Force and ordered to return to Japan. She arrived at Yokosuka on 1 August 1942 and began an overhaul. =Guadalcanal campaign= During I-4‚Ä≤s stay at Yokosuka, the Guadalcanal campaign began on 7 August 1942 with U.S. amphibious landings on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, Florida Island, Gavutu, and Tanambogo in the southeastern Solomon Islands. On 20 August 1942, Submarine Division 8 was disbanded, and I-4 was reassigned to Submarine Division 7. On 8 September 1942 she departed Yokosuka to head to the Solomons war zone and, after calling at Truk from 15 to 19 September 1942, set out for her fifth war patrol, assigned a patrol area south of San Cristobal. On 29 September 1942, I-4 was on the surface southwest of Cape Sidney on San Cristobal when at 23:00 she sighted the U.S. Navy cargo ship on her port bow steaming east-southeast at , escorted by the destroyer . I-4 submerged and began an approach at . At 23:44, she fired two Type 96 torpedoes at Alhena and at 23:51 observed the first torpedo hit Alhena‚Ä≤s stern near No. 5 hold, blowing a hole open on either side of her stern and igniting several fires. The second torpedo also hit, but did not explode. Alhena went dead in the water at and took on a 10-degree stern list. Assuming Alhena would sink, I-4 descended to and began to exit the area at . She broke contact with Monssen at 00:25 on 30 September 1942. At 00:47 her sound operator reported contact with another destroyer, but I-4 soon lost this contact as well. She surfaced at 01:45 and at 04:32 reported that she had sunk a 7,000-ton cargo ship. However, although Alhena suffered six U.S. Navy and 24 United States Marine Corps personnel killed or missing she remained afloat, and in mid-1943 returned to combat reconfigured as an attack cargo ship, redesignated AKA-9.Naval History and Heritage Command Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships Alhena On 5 October 1942, I-4 was reassigned to the \\"A\\" patrol group. On 10 October 1942, she and I-7 were resubordinated directly to the Advance Force and she received orders to divert from her patrol and proceed to the Espiritu Santo area, where a submarine-launched raid was scheduled to take place. The raid was cancelled, and I-4 was again assigned to the \\"A\\" patrol group on 13 October 1942. On 14 October 1942, she received orders to bombard the airfield on Espiritu Santo, but encountered limited visibility as she approached the island from the east and could not find the airfield. On 16 October 1942, she was ordered to patrol in the waters between the Solomon Islands and the New Hebrides. She was west of Espiritu Santo on 25 October 1942 when she sighted a westbound battleship ‚Äî probably ‚Äî and two destroyers, but she lost them in a rain squall and did not attempt an attack. She returned to Truk on 3 November 1942. While at Truk, I-4 underwent a conversion between 4 and 16 November 1942 in which her after gun was replaced with a mounting abaft her conning tower for a waterproof Daihatsu-class landing craft that would allow her to discharge cargo along coastlines in the Solomon Islands, and she was reassigned to the \\"B\\" patrol unit on 15 November 1942. As her conversion was being completed, the commander of the 6th Fleet, Vice Admiral Teruhisa Komatsu, addressed a meeting of the commanding officers of his fleet‚Ä≤s submarines on 16 November 1942 to inform them that the commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, had ordered the 6th Fleet to organize a system of supply runs to the 17th Army forces fighting on Guadalcanal via submarine. Assigned to these supply missions, I-4 departed Truk on 20 November 1942 bound for Rabaul. She stopped at Rabaul from 23 to 25 November 1942 and embarked a waterproof Daihatsu on her new mounting, then proceeded to Shortland Island in the Shortland Islands, her commanding officer receiving a briefing on supply procedures at Guadalcanal while she was at sea off Bougainville. She reached Shortland on 26 November 1942. Carrying her Daihatsu, she departed on 28 November with a cargo of 20 tons of food and medicine and reached Kamimbo Bay on the northwest coast of Guadalcanal on 30 November 1942. She quickly unloaded the Daihatsu and got back underway for Rabaul, which she reached on 3 December 1942. On 5 December 1942 at 16:00, she began another supply run to Guadalcanal, again carrying 20 tons of food and medicine, which she unloaded quickly at Kamimbo Bay on 8 December 1942 before stopping at Shortland Island from 10 to 12 December and then moving on to Rabaul, which she reached on 14 December 1942. =New Guinea campaign= On 16 December 1942, I-4 departed Rabaul on an urgent supply run to Buna, New Guinea, to support Japanese forces fighting in the New Guinea campaign. She arrived off the mouth of the Mambare River on the coast of New Guinea at 22:15 on 18 December 1942, but while she was on the surface the U.S. Navy PT boats PT-121 and PT-122 detected her. The PT boats fired two torpedoes at her, both of which missed, but they forced her to withdraw. She returned to the area a few hours later, but was unable to contact Japanese forces on shore. Her commanding officer transmitted a message saying that he had decided to abort the supply mission and return to Rabaul. =Loss= The submarine , alerted to I-4‚Ä≤s presence by Ultra intelligence information, sighted I-4 at the southern entrance to St. George's Channel off New Ireland, heading north on the surface at , at 06:21 on 21 December 1942. Misidentifying I-4 as an I-168-class submarine, Seadragon described her as painted black and with the number \\"4\\" painted on her conning tower. At 06:37, Seadragon fired three Mark 10 Mod 3 torpedoes at a range of . I-4‚Ä≤s lookouts apparently sighted the approaching torpedoes because I-4 turned in an apparent attempt to comb their wakes. Seadragon‚Ä≤s first torpedo suffered a gyroscope failure and missed ahead and her second torpedo detonated prematurely after running for only 18 seconds. Her third torpedo struck I-4‚Ä≤s stern, resulting in a ball of flames and much smoke. Seadragon saw I-4‚Ä≤s bow rise vertically as she sank by the stern at with the loss of all 90 men on board. On 5 January 1943, the Imperial Japanese Navy officially declared I-4 to be presumed lost with all hands off Rabaul. She was stricken from the Navy list on 1 March 1943.

One day in 1776, Marie Antoinette's carriage was close to run over a five-year-old little boy on the road. The carriage stopped, the boy was saved, and Marie Antoinette became so delighted with his appearance that she took him with her. The boy was not willing to go and did not wish to be taken away from his grandmother, but Marie Antoinette formally \\"adopted\\" him (that is, he became her foster child). He was an orphan, and he and his three elder siblings were being taken care of by his poor grandmother, who was grateful to the queen for the financial assistance she was able to provide the poor family. The queen gave the boy a new name: Armand, which was the name of the son of her favorite, Madame de Polignac. His biological family also benefitted from the adoption: a musical education was financed for his brother Denis Gagn√©, who was employed as a cellist in the royal orchestra in 1787, and monetary gifts given to his sisters Louise Marie Gagn√© and Marie Madeleine Gagn√© until the 10 of August 1792. Armand was the first child the king and queen adopted, but he was not to be the last: he was followed by Ernestine Lambriquet in 1778; Jean Amilcar (c. 1781 ‚Äì 1793) in 1787; a Senegalese slave boy given to the queen as a present by Chevalier de Boufflers in 1787, but whom she instead had freed, baptized, adopted and placed in a pension; and \\"Zo√´\\" Jeanne Louise Victoire (b. 1787), who was adopted in 1790 along with her two older sisters when her parents, an usher and his wife in service of the king, had died. Armand, Ernestine and Zo√´ were, however, the only ones among the queen's foster children to actually live with the royal family rather than to just live on the expense. Armand was taken to live with the queen and was consequently raised as the royal court. As his foster sister Ernestine who followed a couple of years later, he was a constant part of the intimate private life of the royal family and was treated as them in private, but he was not a formal part of the royal court; he was not treated as a prince and his presence at court was an informal one. Armand Gagn√© was described as very spoiled by the queen and reportedly developed a fierce temper. He had been adopted against his will, was very unwilling to leave his grandmother, and appears to have developed a bad relationship to his adoptive parents. On the outbreak of the French revolution of 1789, Gagn√©, who came to have republican sympathies, left his foster family. He joined the revolutionary army, and was killed in the Battle of Jemappes in November 1792.

In 1790, she was orphaned upon the death of her sisters. Her parents were regarded to be loyal to the king and queen, so the queen took on the expenses of their orphaned children. As Jeanne Louise Victoire was close in age to the Dauphin, Marie Antoinette decided to adopt her and keep her in the royal household so that she could function as a playmate of the Dauphin in the same manner as her elder foster daughter Ernestine Lambriquet functioned as a playmate of her daughter Marie Th√©r√®se of France. As she had done with her previous adoptive children, the queen gave Jeanne Louise Victoire a new name: \\"Zo√´\\". Her two elder sisters were, however, sent to a convent boarding school on the queen's expense. She was the last child to be taken in as a foster child by the queen: she was preceded by Armand Gagn√©, Ernestine Lambriquet and Jean Amilcar. She was, however, the only foster child of the queen apart from Armand and Ernestine to actually live with the royal family rather than just on the queen's expense.

Toronto Star, May 18, 2005.

The Globe and Mail, May 21, 2005. The film has its roots in the 1990s, when Joel Secter, who had not been in close contact with his uncle in many years and did not know that his uncle had directed films at all, unwittingly rented his uncle's 1976 sex comedy film Getting Together from a video store. Himself an aspiring filmmaker, he contacted his uncle, and the two collaborated as producers on the 1999 sex comedy film Cyberdorm, although the film was not successful. With even Secter's historically significant Winter Kept Us Warm nearly forgotten by the early 2000s, the two then collaborated on the documentary film, which explored both Secter's early success and his subsequent decision to join a bohemian artists' commune in New York City, where he virtually abandoned filmmaking. In his book Romance of Transgression in Canada: Queering Sexualities, Nations, Cinemas, Thomas Waugh wrote that the film \\"fills in the gaps in the subsequent career of a cinematic and sexual rebel whose artistic promise was not to be fully realized.\\"Thomas Waugh, Romance of Transgression in Canada: Queering Sexualities, Nations, Cinemas. McGill-Queen's University Press, 2006. . p. 506.

The film premiered at the National Screen Institute's FilmExchange festival in Winnipeg, Manitoba in March 2005, and received its first widespread coverage when it screened at the Inside Out Film and Video Festival in Toronto, Ontario in May.

He left the colonial service in 1918 after falling out with his superiors, and later became known as a vocal critic of the brutal treatment of the Congolese workers. Life Alexis F√©licien Bertrand was born in Uccle on 25 May 1870. His family was prosperous. His father was Alexis Joseph Bertrand (1840-1923), a senior civil servant in the state railway administration who served as burgomaster of La Hulpe from 1912 to 1921. His mother was Christine Jadot (1841-1911), aunt of Jean Jadot, Lambert Jadot and Odon Jadot, each of whom later had distinguished careers as engineers and colonial businessmen. Military career Bertrand entered the Royal Military School in 1888. As a lieutenant, he joined the colonial service of the Congo Free State on 21 August 1897. He spent his first term in the Congo from 1897 to 1901, mostly in the northeast region, and in the Lado Enclave in particular. He returned to the Congo in 1902‚Äì1905, 1906‚Äì1909, 1909‚Äì1912 and 1913‚Äì1917. He was a district commissioner in Ubangi District, then in √âquateur District and U√©l√© District. In 1910 he became commissioner general, and in 1913 permanent inspector in U√©l√©. He became deputy to the deputy-governor general of the Orientale Province. In 1911 Sir Authur Hardinge described him as \\"a dedicated 'humanitarian' and strongly‚Äìperhaps too strongly‚Äì'pro.native'\\". In January 1914 Bertrand wrote of \\"caravans ... composed of women, sometimes carrying children, who travel distances of over 50km\\" to bring provisions to the Kanua mining camps of Formini√®re. He reported that at least half their pay was in salt or trade goods of trifling value and at rates one-third below the going rate. In 1915‚Äì1916 Bertrand was responsible for logistics for the Belgian troops fighting the Germans in East Africa. Bertrand was interim vice-governor general of the Orientale Province after Justin Malfeyt left in July 1916, handing over to Adolphe de Meulemeester in August 1917. In his private correspondence and his official reports Bertrand criticized the brutal treatment of the African workers, often forced to work and severely mistreated in places such as the Kilo-Moto gold mines. He was concerned about the real or potential decline in the population, and attacked what he saw as the inadequate \\"indigenous policy\\" of the colonial authorities. He fell out with the governor general, Eug√®ne Henry, and left the Congo at the end of 1917. On 1 March 1918 he formally left the colonial service. On 27 March 1918 he was promoted to colonel, as was normal for an officer seconded to the colonial service. He became an army pensioner on 22 September 1919 at the age of 49. Later career In 1920 Bertrand began working on manpower policy for Formini√®re, a powerful colonial company that was very active in the Kasa√Ø region. His first cousin Jean Jadot was the chairman. Formini√®re was notable for its opposition to forced recruitment of African workers. In 1921 Bertrand became president of the Kasa√Ø Labor Exchange, and in 1927 he became president of the Katanga Labor Exchange. These two private organizations, sanctioned by the authorities, regulated recruitment of Congolese workers by European employers. Betrand became known as an expert on the Congo in some official and political circles. In 1922 the House of Representatives elected Bertrand as a member of the Colonial Council, a position he held until the end of his life. In 1924 he reported on the Congolese workforce to the Belgian Colonial Congress. He became a member of the Commission for the Study of Manpower in the Belgian Congo in 1924. He became an associate member of the Royal Belgian Colonial Institute in 1930, and a full member in 1931. In 1930 a labor commission under Major Alphonse Cayen was appointed after missionaries had complained about the effect of rapid economic development on African Societies. The commission made field investigations in 1931-32 and issued reports on each of the four provinces, and a general report. Bertrand wrote the report on the Orientale Province, which was much the most detailed and seems to have had a strong influence on the overall recommendations in the general report. A basic assumption, as in other reports, was that the Africans were a resource like wild animals. Quotas had to be set and enforced on how many Africans could be recruited so the general population could be maintained at a healthy level. Betrand wrote a 1932 report that strongly criticized the practices at the Kilo-Moto gold mines, leading to a heated argument with General Georges Moulaert, the head of the company and an influential person in the colonial establishment. Bertrand became increasingly viewed as gadfly for his criticism. In 1939 Bertrand married Jeanne Tercafs, a young sculptor 28 years younger than him, who received artistic grants for several trips to the Mangbetu country in the Congo between 1935 and 1940. Bertrand was also interested in African arts, and was a member of the commission for the protection of indigenous arts and crafts, which had been created in 1935. He presented the work of his future wife, Jeanne Tercafs, to the Royal Colonial Institute from 1937. During World War II Bertrand was among those Belgians who considered that German victory was inevitable, and they should make the best they could of the new situation. As a result, he associated himself with leaders of the Kolonialpolitisches Amt, the colonial service of the Nazi party. His wife died prematurely in 1944. After the liberation of Belgium he was investigated and then charged in July 1945, although he was not arrested. He resigned from his position at the Royal Colonial Institute. He died in Uccle on 20 September 1946, the day after leaving the Colonial Council.

Move to the United States Pinedo participated in the Cuban exodus and emigrated to Miami on April 6, 1961 at the age of 12 as part of Operation Peter Pan, after which he became part of the Cuban diaspora residing in the United States. His parents, unable to leave due to government restrictions, would remain in Cuba. His maternal uncle Eric Beraza, a Spanish- born military boot manufacturer, was already living in the United States and was responsible for Pinedo‚Äôs upbringing in the US. After a brief nine-day stay in Miami, the two would live in North Carolina where Beraza was residing. They would stay in North Carolina for two years before returning to Miami to join his maternal grandparents who were leave Cuba and join the large Cuban exile community there. As a teenager Pinedo attended Miami Jackson Senior High School until the tenth grade when he and his uncle relocated to San Jose California to pursue better opportunities. While there he graduated high school and then attended San Jose City College where he studied languages.  Art career and later life  In 1972 Pinedo returned to Miami and the following year he met Josefina Camacho, recently divorced from famed Cuban artist Juan Gonz√°lez. Pinedo and Camacho met and had their first dates at the Permuy Gallery, one of the first Cuban art galleries in South Florida and an influential venue in supporting the Latin arts community of the region. The couple became close to the gallery‚Äôs manager, fine art dealer Marta Permuy. Pinedo and Camacho were active in Permuy‚Äôs popular Friday Gallery Nights (known colloquially in the Cuban community as ‚Äúlos viernes‚Äù) and its affiliated evening cultural salon gatherings. These long-running weekly events were an important cultural nexus in the early Latin American art market of South Florida. In these gatherings Permuy would introduce Pinedo to many artists, collectors, and other community figures and was his first major immersion in the arts. Pinedo and Camacho were a frequent presence at these influential gatherings and Permuy would be a close associate and important mentor to Pinedo throughout his career. Through this network, Pinedo first began collecting art and building an extensive portfolio of several high- profile artists during this period. Pinedo was an early supporter of Baruj Salinas before his rise to international prominence and Pinedo would consistently collect works from Salinas‚Äô various artistic periods since meeting in the 1970s. Salinas had also been a neighbor at one time of Juan Gonz√°lez before Gonz√°lez's move to New York City. Pinedo would also be an avid collector of other Cuban artists during this formative period when the Latin American art market was beginning to take shape. Many of these were influential artists who helped shape that early landscape, such as other members of the Grupo GALA and the trio of Lourdes Gomez Franca, Dionisio ‚ÄúDenis‚Äù Perkins, and Miguel ‚ÄúMickey‚Äù Jorge. Pinedo and Camacho married on February 3, 1979. The couple remained on good terms with Gonz√°lez and occasionally represented him in South Florida after he relocated to New York in the early 1970s. Beginning in the 1980s, Permuy helped Pinedo expand his involvement in the arts beyond collecting to include his own fine art dealing practice. He first became a prominent art figure in his own right during this period when Miami had emerged as an international art center with the fame of the ‚ÄúMiami Generation‚Äù of artists and the broad re-establishment of earlier artists from the Vieja Guardia generation. In 1983 the Pinedos contributed artworks that were featured in the Cuban Museum of Art's landmark exhibition from which the Miami Generation era drew its name. In the 1990s Pinedo founded and established Marcos Pinedo Fine Art Inc., through which he conducts his art dealings and transactions. In 2006 Pinedo provided most of the works used in Baruj Salinas' career retrospective exhibition held in Florida National University. The Pinedo collection The Marcos and Josefina Pinedo fine art collection includes paintings, drawings, sculptures, and photography of Cuban, American, European, and other Latin American fine art. The styles range from figurative to total abstraction and include works that feature Cubism, Expressionism, Modernism, Realism and other 20th Century and Contemporary art genres and movements. Several works, such as those by Agust√≠n C√°rdenas and Juan Gonz√°lez, are valued in excess of $100,000, representing the upper levels of the historically undervalued international Cuban art market. The Pinedo Collection also holds the largest private collection of works by Baruj Salinas, spanning more than 30 works from various periods of Salinas‚Äô career, including the artwork Spiraling II (1979) that features on the cover of the book BARUJ SALINAS. The collection also provided most of the works used for Salinas' 2006 career retrospective exhibition in Miami that spanned more than 30 works of acrylic paintings (including his noted Language of the Clouds series), drawings, and ceramics. Following the philosophy of his mentor Marta Caza√±as Permuy, Pinedo would collect both renown, well-established artists as well as seek out and support unknown, struggling, and emerging artists to help them better establish themselves in the arts. He has also donated several artworks to the Museum of Art Fort Lauderdale and Florida National University. In 1993, Marcos and Josefina Pinedo contributed to the book Dreamscapes: The Art of Juan Gonz√°lez, which featured works from the Pinedo Collection. Cuban art The Marcos and Josefina Pinedo fine art collection is most associated with Cuban art. Beginning in the 1970s, Pinedo and his wife would support and collect several Cuban artists of the Vanguardia and Vieja Guardia generations. In the ensuing decades, their art collection would grow to include some of the most prominent Cuban painters of the 20th and 21st century, including: Wifredo Lam, Juan Gonz√°lez, Baruj Salinas, Rafael Soriano, Enrique Riveron, Lourdes Gomez Franca, Dionisio Perkins, Miguel Jorge, Agust√≠n Fernandez, Cundo Bermudez, Humberto Calzada, Emilio Hector Rodriguez, Carlos Macias (1951-1994), and Paul Sierra. In addition painters, the Pinedos also collected works of sculptural art by Cuban sculptors: Agust√≠n C√°rdenas, Enrique Gay Garc√≠a, and Rafael Consuegra and photography from Miguel Fleitas. American, European, and Latin American art While the Pinedo collection is primarily composed of Cuban art, it also features several notable non-Cuban art, such American, European (French, Spanish), and other Latin American art (Mexican, Argentine, and Chilean). These include: Alexander Calder, Marc Chagall, Joan Miro, Eduardo Chillida, Roxana McAllister, Rufino Tamayo, Raul Anguiano, Roberto Matta, Rafael Ferrer, and P√©rez Celis. Legacy Pinedo and his contributed artwork to be featured in the defining 1983 \\"Miami Generation\\" exhibition that came to define Miami art in that decade as it emerged into an international art center. Pinedo has donated artwork from the Pinedo Collection to the Museum of Art Fort Lauderdale and Florida National University which have been added to their permanent collections. These include works by prominent artists Wifredo Lam, Baruj Salinas, and others. Many of these works by Salinas, Agust√≠n C√°rdenas, and Carlos Alfonzo, were featured in the major 1997 ‚ÄúBreaking Barriers‚Äù exhibition, which was later the subject of a book of the same name. He also contributed to and helped organize Salinas' 2006 career retrospective. In addition to Breaking Barriers, Pinedo has also been mentioned and discussed in several other books and literature on Cuban art, including Cuban American Art in Miami: Exile, Identity, and the Neo- Baroque (2004), Cuban Artists Across the Diaspora: Setting the Tent Against the House (2011), and Abstraction: a tradition of collecting in Miami (1994) as well as El Nuevo Herald and The Miami Herald. Works from the Pinedo Collection have also been featured in artist-specific books, including BARUJ SALINAS (1979), and Dreamscapes: The Art of Juan Gonz√°lez (1994).

The painting depicts the seafront between Newlyn and Penzance in Cornwall, in windy and rainy weather, with waves crashing onto the promenade. The painting measures and is signed, \\"Norman Garstin Newlyn\\". It shows several groups of people walking in the rain, some with umbrellas, a policeman with a cape, and a man standing beside a horse and cart. Among the buildings visible in the distance to the northeast are the Queens Hotel, Penzance and St Mary's Church, Penzance. Beside a rail at the edge of the promenade stands a blue painted cast iron RNLI collection box, installed in 1877 to raise funds for the Penlee lifeboat. The use of negative space shows influence from Degas, whom Garstin met when studying with Carolus-Duran in Paris: for example, compare Degas's 1876 painting Place de la Concorde, itself influenced by Japanese art and possibly by early photography. Garstin sent the painting to the Royal Academy in 1889 but it was not selected for exhibition, possibly because the jury considered it was \\"too French\\" in style. The artist donated the work to Penzance Town Council, and it remains at the Penlee House gallery and museum in Penzance. It was not exhibited for some time after it was acquired, due to concerns that tourists would not wish to see Penzance in the rain. The blue RNLI collection box was later removed from the sea front. It was bought online in 2018, and restored in 2020 by the BBC television programme The Repair Shop, to be exhibited at Penlee Lifeboat Station. The title of the work refers a line from William Shakespeare's King Lear where an unnamed fool declares in Act 2, scene 3: \\"He that has and a little tiny wit / With heigh-ho, the wind and the rain / Must make content with his fortunes fit, / For the rain it raineth every day.\\" References * The Rain It Raineth Every Day, Norman Garstin (1847‚Äì1926), Penlee House Gallery & Museum, ArtUK * The Rain it Raineth Every Day, Penlee House Gallery & Museum * \\"RNLI collection box depicted in famous Victorian painting of Penzance Prom restored to former glory\\", CornwallLive, 21 April 2020 * \\"Authors on museums: The paintings of Penzance\\", The Economist, 17 July 2014 External links * The Rain It Raineth Every Day by Norman Garstin * Norman Garstin: Irishman and Newlyn Artist by Richard Pryke Category:1889 paintings Category:Newlyn School of Artists Category:Penzance ","title":"The Rain It Raineth Every Day"},{"id":"64807938","text":"Deliver Us from Evil () is a Canadian drama film, directed by Jean-Claude Lord and released in 1969.Charles-Henri Ramond, \\"D√©livrez-nous du mal ‚Äì Film de Jean-Claude Lord\\".

In addition to the new title, the regiment adopted a new uniform; peak casque, with stiff black horsehair crest and mock leopard skin turban helmet, pink turnbacks, dark green jacket, dark green breeches, dark green gaiters, black boots, dark green pockets, pink trimmed dark green pockets, pink trimmed dark green cuffs, pink cuff flaps, and white buttons.  War of the First Coalition  In September 1791, the battalion moved to Puy and Saint-Flour before being redirected to Strasbourg and Fort-Louis du Rhin to join the vanguard of the Army of the Rhine Arm√©e du Rhin. The next year, the battalion joined the Army of Custines, and showed great bravery on 9 November during the Battle of Limburg. On 20 March 1793, two companies distinguished themselves at the vanguard engagement in Stromberg, where General Prus Zekuly was defeated. On 30 March 1793 during the Battle of Ober-Fl√∂rsheim, the battalion supported the efforts of the 13√©me R√©giment d'Infanterie de Ligne (Bourbonnais) which brought the town to order. From 12 to 14 September, they distinguished themsevles yet again during the Battle of Nothweiler Camp. On the 14th, at daybreak, they left Bobenthal, followed by the 1st Haute-Sa√¥ne and 1st Vosges Battalions and attacked the enemy camp from the left of the entrenched position. Leading his detachment, Lieutenant Burneau was the first the enter the redoubts and continued a bayonet charge which cause the entire enemy force to route. The years following the Revolution saw great changes for the French Army: the old royalist infantry regiments were to serve as the stiffening for the tens of thousands of new volunteers who answered the patriotic Lev√©e en masse. In the First Amalgamation of 1794, each old royalist battalion was put together with two new volunteers battalions to become new Demi-Brigade de Bataille or Demi- Brigade of Battle. Therefore, on 26 December 1794, the battalion amalgamated with the 1st Corr√®ze and 2nd Dordogne Volunteer Battalions to form the new 7√©me Demi-Brigade d'Infanterie L√©g√®re.

Kurt Myers, a 64-year-old resident of the village of Mohawk, set fire to his apartment before 9:30am and proceeded to a barber shop in Mohawk. Myers briefly spoke to the barbershop owner John Seymour before opening fire, killing two customers and injuring Seymour and another customer. He proceeded to a car wash in the nearby village of Herkimer, where he killed an employee and a customer. Myers was pursued by police and eventually cornered in an abandoned bar in Herkimer. The standoff lasted overnight. Police entered the building at around 8am on . Myers shot and killed a police dog named \\"Ape\\" and the police returned fire, killing him. No motive for the shootings is known. At the time of the shooting, Myers had no savings, no job, and was maxed out on all his credit cards: he also had very little furniture in his apartment. Myers had no previous criminal record aside from a 1973 arrest for drunken driving. Neighbors said he never had visitors or friends: the few who were familiar described him as an \\"odd little man\\" who rarely spoke. The shootings occurred a few months after the signing of the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act of 2013, or NY SAFE Act. The act was discussed in the light of these shootings, and vice versa.

History The virtualization technology that led to XenDesktop was first developed in 2000 through an open-source hypervisor research project led by Ian Pratt at the University of Cambridge called Xen Project for x86. Pratt founded a company called XenSource in 2004, which made a commercial version of the Xen hypervisor. In 2007, Citrix acquired XenSource, releasing XenDesktop version 2.0 in 2008. The company continues to release updated versions, with XenDesktop 7.6 featuring HDX technology enhancements for audio, video and graphics user experience, as well as a reduction in storage costs associated with virtual desktop deployments as a result of improvements to Citrix provisioning services. In 2018, the software was renamed Citrix Virtual Desktops. Product overview The product's aim is to give employees the ability to work from anywhere while cutting information technology management costs because desktops and applications are centralized. XenDesktop also aims to provide security, because data is not stored on the devices of end users, instead being saved in a centralized datacenter or cloud infrastructure. Citrix developed the software for use by medium to large enterprise customers. Citrix Workspace is able to manage and deliver applications and desktops using a connection broker called Desktop Delivery Controller. It supports multiple hypervisors, including Citrix Hypervisor, VMware vSphere, Microsoft Hyper-V and Nutanix Acropolis to create virtual machines to run the applications and desktops. The software allows for several types of delivery methods and is compatible with multiple architectures, including desktops and servers, datacenters, and private, public or hybrid clouds. Virtualized applications can be delivered to virtual desktops using Virtual Apps.

Both stores were founded and owned by self-described _Trekkers_ Chuck Weiss and Sandy Sarris. Described as the \\"first of its kind\\", and very likely the first independent retail store solely devoted to a television series, the Federation Trading Post was seen as contributing to the rise of Star Trek fan culture in the Bay Area and in New York City in the years between the cancellation of the _original series_ in 1969, and the release of _Star Trek the Motion Picture_ in 1979. During this time, the show had entered syndication and gained new fans, many of whom took to letter-writing campaigns to bring the show back on the air. Official merchandise for the growing fan base had been sparse, so many unlicensed fan creations were shared and/or sold at early science fiction conventions.  The ‚ÄúRed Hour‚Äù Festival  Star Trek specific fan club events had begun before the show's cancellation in 1969, although guests were not included in any organized convention setting until January, 1972. _Star Trek Lives_ details the first series of _Star Trek conventions_ , growing steadily in New York, as well as a nationwide campaign by fans to see a series revival. Weiss, Sarris and other San Francisco fans of the series would meet to watch reruns and exchange trivia. Their organization efforts led to The \\"Red Hour\\" Festival (referencing the episode \\" _The Return of the Archons_ \\"), the first Star Trek convention held in Northern California. The twelve-hour event was held at Lincoln High School in San Francisco on February 22, 1975, and served as a fundraising effort for the local fan club, Star Trek Archives. Actors _James Doohan_ , _George Takei_ , _Walter Koenig_ and _Arlene Martel_ appeared, along with others. Reportedly, 1,000 fans were turned away for lack of space. The event garnered attention in the local press, including a mention by _Herb Caen_ in his column in the San Francisco Chronicle, and its success helped convince Weiss and Sarris to open the Federation Trading Post.  Federation Trading Post (West)  The Federation Trading Post opened on May 11, 1975 at 2556 Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley, California, selling toys and memorabilia of the original Star Trek television series. 1,500 people lined up the small store on its opening day, with a line down Telegraph Avenue. Within days of the Berkeley store opening, local news reported that the Federation Trading Post was receiving hundreds of letters of mail a day, many inquiring about a potential catalog. Eight months later, People Magazine's first national edition (it had previously been a west coast publication) hit the stands with an _article about Chuck and Sandy‚Äôs new business ‚ÄúEnterprise_.‚Äù The store provided a meeting place for like-minded fans, and no one was ever pressured to buy anything. To add to the atmosphere, audio recordings of episodes with the dialog edited out, leaving only the music and sound effects, would play continuous in the background on an 8-track loop. Weiss explained the attraction: \\"Here they can come and let their hair down and be among friends . . .\\"  Mail Order Catalog  Almost all of the items sold at the Federation Trading Post were featured in a mail order catalog that shipped to all fifty states, and seven foreign countries. The store and its catalog boasted over three hundred items, including _tribbles_ , real looking _phaser s_, _Vulcan_ ear appliances made by professional make-up artist Doug Jones, posters, records, photos of the cast, model kits, key chains, buttons, bumper stickers, blueprints of the _Starship Enterprise_ , games, t-shirts, iron-on patches, _Starfleet uniforms_ (for both men and women), uniform insignia, and candy in the shape of Mr. Spock. Most of the items were fan-produced, as very little licensed merchandise was available. The store also stocked a variety of _Fanzines_ , which were themselves instamental in building fan-based communities, long before online \\"social media.\\"  Arcade Cabinet  In 1977, computer engineer _Dave Needle_ , Bob Ewell and software designer Stan Shepherd were interested in creating a Star Trek video game arcade cabinet, and approached Chuck Weiss at the Federation Trading Post about placing it in the store. This had not been the first attempt or offer, but after four months the team had finished the game, using two Intel 8080 8-bit microprocessors. When the game was over _The Doomsday Machine_ , from the episode of the same name, would appear and eat the ship of the losing player.  Federation Trading Post (East)  In October of 1975, The Federation Trading Post East opened in Manhattan at 210 East 53rd Street. The store duplicated the one in Berkeley, with the addition of a Star Trek Museum, featuring realistic looking fan-produced reproductions of Star Trek models and props. _Isaac Asimov_ and his wife, _Janet Jeppson_ (who was a big Star Trek fan), attended the opening night party. Ron Barlow and _Doug Drexler_ (who would later move to Hollywood and win two Emmys, and an Academy Award for his work on _Dick Tracy_ ), managed the New York location. Just as in Berkeley, the New York City store was an instant hit its first year, with a line of people often waiting to get in. The local fans were so enthused that they raised funds to air a 30-second TV commercial for the store during syndicated Star Trek reruns. The success of the Federation Trading Post inspired imitators on both coasts, including the Intergalactic Trading Company in New York City, and the Interstellar Trading Post in San Diego, California.  Star Trek Museum  The New York location designated a room as the \\"World's First Star Trek Museum\\", customized with _Matt Jeffries_ inspired doorway arches and painted backdrops with lights and electronics to resemble the Starship Enterprise. Displayed in the museum were authentic props and uniforms from the collection of Alan Asherman, author of the \\" _Star Trek Compendium._ \\" The museum also hosted a six-foot model of a _Klingon Battlecruiser,_ loving crafted by two fans, along with other replicas of ships and weapons.  Sued by Paramount Studios  After the Federation Trading Post opened in New York City, the store was sued by _Gulf and Western_ , parent company of _Paramount Studios_ at the time, alleging infringement of their common law trademark, ‚ÄúStar Trek.‚Äù The owners were able to acquire representation by the prestigious San Francisco law firm of Philips, Moore, Weissenberger, Lempio & Majestic. Eventually the suit was settled out of court without admission of wrongdoing by the defendants, and the store was given a sales and manufacturing license, which allowed it to continue conducting business as before.  The Effect of Star Wars  The unprecedented success of _Star Wars_ in 1977 suddenly brought science fiction into the mainstream. Whereas before, toys and memorabilia from science fiction movies and TV shows were hard to find, after the release of Star Wars the Federation Trading Post was soon competing with the large, nationwide retail outlets. To keep up, the store‚Äôs inventory expanded to include not only Star Wars merchandise, but also futuristic items such as 3D holographic pendants. An enlarged ‚Äú21st Century‚Äù edition of the mail order catalog was created to include the store‚Äôs new offerings.  Guest Appearances  Most of the original cast signed autographs at the Federation Trading Post. _William Shatner_ (Capt. James Kirk) promoted his new album ‚Äú _William Shatner Live_ ‚Äù at the Berkeley store, signing his name to every copy sold that day. _James Doohan_ (Chief Engineer, Montgomery Scott), _George Takei_ (Helmsman, Hikaru Sulu), _Nichelle Nichols_ (Communications Officer, Nota Uhura), _Grace Lee Whitney_ (Yeoman, Janice Randy), Bruce Hyde (Transporter Technician, Kevin Riley), and guest star _Arlene Martel_ (Spock's fianc√©e, T‚ÄôPring), along with _Franz Joseph Schnaubelt_ (creator of the _Enterprise Blueprints_ and author of the \\" _Starfleet Technical Manual_ \\") also made appearances in Berkeley. _David Prowse_ (Darth Vader of Star Wars) later appeared at the Berkeley location. At the New York store, _Nichelle Nichols_ (Communications Officer, Nyota Uhura) signed autographs. _Leonard Nimoy_ dropped by in costume while touring with the Royal Shakespeare Company in the title role of \\"Sherlock Homes\\". Other notable visitors included comics legend Stan Lee, and Stephen A. Whitfield, author of \\"The Making of Star Trek\\", and Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry himself. Federation Trading Post was mentioned in _Robert Anton Wilson_ 's \\" _Cosmic Trigger_ ,\\" and \\" _Neuropolitics_ \\" by _Timothy Leary_ , Robert Anton Wilson, George A. Koopman. In 1976 the store advertised in some of the earliest _Starlog magazine_ issues, and contributed a newsletter to _TV Sci-Fi Monthly_.

It is an important authority in the field of criminal law, for the circumstances in which it is permissible for a jury's guilty verdict to be overturned by a judge. The case involved an appeal against criminal conviction by a father, against allegations of sexual assault and rape by his daughter. His appeal was allowed by majority.  Background  M was convicted in the District Court in Sydney. The counts found against him were two of indecent assault, and three of sexual intercourse. Each was allegedly committed against the complainant; one of his biological daughters. The daughter was 13 years old at the time of the alleged offending. An appeal against conviction was made to the Court of Criminal Appeal on the ground that his conviction was unsafe and unsatisfactory. That appeal was dismissed. Sully J, one of the three judges presiding, said of the appeal; > 'For my own part, I would say at once that, were it permissible Kingdom, I > would favour upholding the present appeal upon the ground now being > discussed. I would take that view because, broadly speaking, I have in > purely subjective terms a feeling of anxiety and discomfort about the > verdicts of guilty that were returned against the present appellant' The other two justices, Cripps JA and Finlay J, agreed with Sully J in dismissing the appeal; but dissociated themselves from his expressed feeling of anxiety or discomfort. M was granted special leave to appeal his conviction at the High Court.  Judgments = Majority judgement  Discussion of principle = The majority discussed at length previous judicial commentary on when it was appropriate, as a matter of law, for criminal appellate courts to overturn a conviction on the unsafe or unsatisfactory ground. This included a discussion of Lindy Chamberlain's unsuccessful appeal. They found that the relevant question a court must ask itself, is whether; 'it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty'. However, it also found that courts must have full regard to the jury's role as the primary body to be entrusted with a determination of guilt or innocence, and of the benefit jurors have in seeing and hearing from witnesses. They then set out a description of what that evaluation entails; > \\"In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt > which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's > advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt > experienced by a court of criminal appeal, that the court may conclude that > no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks > credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it > was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a > reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record > itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or > otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of > criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the > advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an > innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to > set aside a verdict based upon that evidence.Court citing: Chamberlain v. > The Queen (No.2) (1984) 153 CLR at 618-619; Chidiac v. The Queen [1991] HCA > 4; (1991) 171 CLR 432 at 443-444 In doing so, the court is not substituting > trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must > always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it > was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the > accused was guilty.Court citing: Chidiac v. The Queen (1991) 171 CLR at 443, > 451, 458, 461-462 Although the propositions stated in the four preceding > sentences have been variously expressed in judgments of members of the Court > in previous cases, we have put aside those differences in expression in > order to provide authoritative guidance to courts of criminal appeal by > stating the propositions in the form in which they are set out above.\\" - per > Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson, Toohey, and Gaudron JJ The majority made note of the anxiety and discomfort experienced by Sully J, saying it was indicative of a 'doubt (which) appears to have been engendered by shortcomings in the evidence, which are not met by reference to the jury's advantage in seeing the witnesses'. Sully J was therefore found to have made an error at law for having concluded that the appeal should be dismissed. The principles outlined were then applied to the facts of the case. = Application to evidence = The prosecution called two medical practitioners to examine the complainant. The first found that the complainant's hymen was intact, and found this to be inconsistent with a rape by forced vaginal penetration. The second medical practitioner found there was no evidence 'one way or the other' of physical penetration. In cross-examination it became an issue that the complainant's account of the rape on Saturday 8 September 1990, included sitting and watching television with the appellant; as the complainant had claimed to have been watching a western movie. She was challenged by the defense that no such movie had been programmed for that evening. Similarly, the complainant testified that she had heard her mother watching tennis on the TV, on the night of the 22nd of September; although it was put to her in cross that no tennis was programmed for that night. Additionally, the appellant's wife testified that her bedroom was within hearing distance of the kitchen (she claimed to be cleaning the kitchen on the night of the 22nd); and her bed was squeaky. The complainant agreed in cross that the bed 'must have squeaked an awful lot when (her) father was attacking (her)'. The complainant's evidence was found not to have been corroborated by anyone; and to have been contradicted by the first medical examiner. The month-long delay before the she made a complaint, and 'apparent equanimity' with which she was found to have conducted herself during the family barbecue the day following the alleged penetration on the 22nd; according to the court 'suggested the need for careful scrutiny of the allegations which she made against the appellant'. The court also cast aspersions on the complainant's credibility for a complaint she had made to a medical registrar 2 years prior (when she was 11). In that complaint she had alleged that her younger half- sister (then 8 years old) had tormented her by touching her genital area in an aggressive manner. The majority decided that those accusations had 'revealed a capacity on the part of the complainant to make a complaint of a sexual nature to a person in authority about a member of her family'. The appellant was found to have co-operated fully with the police investigation, and to have consistently denied the allegations against him. He gave evidence on oath denying the allegations, and was found to have not been discredited in 'any way' by cross-examination. Character evidence had been led on the appellant's behalf, including from people who had, with full knowledge of the allegations made against the complainant, permitted children to remain overnight at the appellant's home. However, what the majority found most important to their acquittal was; > 'the improbability of the appellant acting as he was alleged to have done in > the circumstances prevailing on that night, namely, on a squeaky bed in an > unlocked bedroom which was only a short distance from, and within hearing > distance of, another bedroom occupied by the appellant's wife, in a fully > occupied, small house' In light of all of the evidence, it was found that: > 'No doubt the jury believed the complainant and disbelieved the appellant > and did so having seen and heard them both. But even making full allowance > for the manner in which both gave their evidence, the matters which cast > doubt upon the prosecution case, to which we have referred, remain > unanswered.' For that reason the majority jointly decided to allow the appeal.

It is situated in the heart of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, on land managed by Mount Baker- Snoqualmie National Forest. Iron Cap Mountain is set two miles west of the crest of the Cascade Range. Precipitation runoff from the south side of the mountain drains into tributaries of the Snoqualmie River, whereas the north side drains into tributaries of the Foss River. Although modest in elevation, relief is significant since Iron Cap rises 2,500 feet above the Middle Fork Snoqalmie River Valley in less than one mile. Its neighbors include La Bohn Peak, to the east, and Little Big Chief Mountain, to the southeast. Climate Iron Cap Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in avalanche danger. This climate supports a small ice remnant on the east side of the pek, and another in the northwest cirque. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The elevation range of this area is between about in the lower elevations to over on Mount Stuart. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The U-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

These empires, or upholders of empire, espouse the claim that women from other countries need to be saved and that intervention is vital in realizing liberation for these women. The term imperial feminism itself is a critique. In academia and discourse surrounding women's studies, the term is generally used to criticize Western feminism for perpetuating stereotypes about non- white, non-Western cultures and societies as 'barbaric', 'savage', or uniquely oppressive to women and for excluding marginalized, minority ethnic women from mainstream feminism. Critics argue that such rhetoric downplays gender inequality and patriarchy in the Global North by emphasizing the need for intervention in the Global South. However, while academia concerning this phenomenon tends to focus on the intersection between Western feminism and imperialism, the phenomenon is not inherently exclusive to Western feminism; the same critique can be applied to any other states which use similar rhetoric. The phenomenon of imperial feminism and its impact on women in the Global South is often underrepresented in feminist studies, which usually center around mainstream white feminism. Those with experiences different from mainstream feminism, such as women of color, Muslim women, and others impacted by the legacy of colonialism and imperialism in their countries, face exclusion and marginalization by the mainstream discourse. In response, postcolonial feminism developed in order to address these issues.  History = Colonial era  The ideology behind imperial feminism goes back to at least the 18th and 19th centuries when European colonialism was rapidly expanding throughout the world. Administrators of colonies in the Global South, who celebrated liberty and representative democracy back home, justified their imperial ventures and colonial expansions by claiming that Western civilization was superior to others and thus it was an acceptable, if not a moral decision, to conquer. John Stuart Mill's The Subjection of Women, an essay written in the 19th century advocating for equality between the sexes, demonstrates the contempt many Europeans held for non-Western civilizations. > ...[T]he English are farther from a state of nature than any other modern > people. They are, more than any other people, a product of civilization and > discipline. As he lauds the superiority of the West in order to advocate for gender equality, Mill goes on to berate 'the Orient' and 'Hindoo' civilizations as regressive in this regard. Edward Said characterizes this phenomenon as \\"Orientalism\\" and claims European scholarship, culture, and society have perpetuated stereotypes about non-Western civilizations' culture, practices, and society as morally depraved in order to establish their own superiority. Among these practices, the subjugation of women was heavily criticized and exploited by colonial powers as a way to expand their empires. For example, British colonial rule in South Asia condemned cultural practices such as sati, child marriage, and purdah. In Southwest Asia and North Africa, colonial rulers fixated on the veil as a symbol of oppression. Lord Cromer (Evelyn Baring), a colonial administrator in British-occupied Egypt, was known for his unveiling campaigns. In the Philippines, Western powers were horrified by the social acceptance of women‚Äôs exposed breasts in public. Europeans viewed these practices as backwards and demonstrative of a need for European enlightenment and saviorship, providing colonial powers with a segue into imposed colonial rule. Some historians and critics point out that while upholders of imperial feminist ideology claim they intend to liberate and increase women‚Äôs rights, the expansion of empire actually takes priority. For example, Lord Cromer was a strong proponent of symbolic female liberation by campaigning against the veil, but his actual enacted policies did not benefit Egyptian women. Additionally, in Britain, he headed the Men's League for Opposing Woman Suffrage. Another example is British colonial rule in South Asia. While British colonial administrators claimed to desire gender equality for Indian women, they often upheld and maintained institutions of patriarchy in order to continue their colonial rule.  21st century  After the September 11 attacks, America invaded Afghanistan. However, a lot of the rhetoric involved in justifying the military intervention focused on the plight of the Afghan women and the abuse they faced at the hands of the Taliban. Laura Bush, for example, made several radio addresses tying the U.S. military invasion to protecting Afghan women's rights. A couple months after the initial invasion, Laura Bush celebrated the U.S.'s apparent progress towards emancipating the women of Afghanistan: > \\"Because of our recent military gains, in much of Afghanistan women are no > longer imprisoned in their homes. They can listen to music and teach their > daughters without fear of punishment. Yet, the terrorists who helped rule > that country now plot and plan in many countries, and they must be stopped. > The fight against terrorism is also a fight for the rights and dignity of > women.\\" However, critics are quick to point out that war and military intervention brought more political instability to the region and ended up killing many civilians, including women. Activist Malalai Joya is a outspoken critic of the U.S.'s misguided policies and its role in political instability to the region.  Radical feminist response  Answering to the question by Elliot Friedland , that many western feminists have been feeling that to critique human rights abuses perpetrated against women and girls in Muslim majority societies (e.g., male guardianship laws, FGM) by westerners amount to imperial interference with other cultures; atheist feminist Aki Muthali responds saying such weak and bigoted arguments are used for knowingly deceiving pushed for diverting attention from discrimination and violence against girls and women in Islamic world. According to Aki Muthali', if everything would have left to conservative Christians/Catholics back then still Crusades, Inquisition and Salem witch-hunts would have been exist in today's times too. Aki Muthali further says, an abuse is an abuse; if some one witnesses or becomes aware of any human right abuse then has responsibility expose and condemn the same and no one has any right to tell any rightly minded, whether be white or brown or Christian or Muslim or atheist or non-Muslim to refrain from challenging any abuse of human rights anywhere.

He was a minor cleric of the cathedral of Passau from at least July 1183. He became dean of the cathedral in 1187 and joined the army of Frederick Barbarossa on the Third Crusade in 1189. He wrote an account in Latin of his experience, known as the Descriptio expeditionis Asiaticae Friderici (\\"Description of the Asian Expedition of Frederick\\"), covering the period from 1189 down to 21 June 1190. According to the Historia de expeditione Friderici imperatoris, which plagiarized his Descriptio, Tageno died at Tripoli in the autumn of 1190. No independent copy of Tageno's account survives. It is known only from its incorporation into other works. The Historia de expeditione incorporates Tageno's account of the period from 16 May to 9 June 1190 almost verbatim, including the use of the first person. The entirety of the Descriptio was incorporated into the chronicle of Magnus of Reichersberg, who died in 1195. Magnus occasionally alters Tageno's first person to the third person, and he may have made other alterations to the text. Furthermore, he probably had access to an early draft of the Historia de expeditione, meaning that their texts are not independent witnesses to the original Descriptio. Magnus calls the Descriptio simply a \\"record\\" (memoria). Graham Loud considers it almost a diary. A slightly different version of Tageno's Descriptio from that in Magnus appeared in a book published by the Bavarian humanist Johannes Aventinus in 1522. It is unknown if Aventinus had access to the original text or was relying on a version of Magnus's chronicle. The differences between the two versions of the Descriptio are largely stylistic and may reflect Aventinus emendation of the text in accordance with humanistic notions of Latinity.

Biography  Santos was born in the Rio de Janeiro neighborhood of Santa Teresa to Antonio Luiz dos Santos, a civil servant, and Marta Martins dos Santos, a nurse. Her career as an actress began early: She appeared in her first film, O Corti√ßo, at age 15, and later appeared in the Oscar-winning Black Orpheus. Santos studied at the Faculdade Nacional de Filosofia (now the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro) and became a member of the National Union of Students, Brazil's largest student organization. In this intellectual environment, she began to create works of street theater, with the goal of engaging audiences politically. She joined the Teatro Experimental do Negro, a theater company founded in rejection of blackface performances, in Rio and later in S√£o Paulo. In the late 1960s, she co-founded the Centro de Cultura e Arte Negra (Center of Black Culture and Art). In the 1970s, during the military dictatorship, she co-wrote and staged with the sociologist Eduardo de Oliveira the piece E agora falamos n√≥s (\\"And Now We Speak\\"), which is considered to be one of the first pieces of Brazilian theater written for an exclusively black cast. She was also involved in directing Carnival performances based in Afro-Brazilian culture. In the 1960s, Santos also began to participate in the liberation movement for Portuguese-speaking African countries. She was imprisoned in the early 1970s for her work with the Brazilian Communist Party. After her release, she chose to leave Brazil. Santos rejected invitations to move to the then-Soviet Union and instead chose to self-exile in Africa, where she stayed for around five years. She actively participated in the liberation movements of Guinea-Bissau and Angola as a guerrilla. She also worked on cultural development and literacy projects, contributing to cultural reconstruction in Guinea-Bissau, Angola, and Cape Verde. In the 1980s, she was the first black woman to be named to the State Council on the Female Condition in S√£o Paulo. She was also an advisor on Afro- Brazilian culture to the secretary of culture for S√£o Paulo state from 1986 until 2002. In 1986, she was selected by the Black Women's Collective of S√£o Paulo to run for the office of state deputy for the Brazilian Democratic Movement, but she was not elected. In September 1993, the city legislator Vital Nolasco of the Communist Party of Brazil awarded her the honorary title of Cidad√£ Paulistana. Santos returned in her final years to Rio, where she died in 2012. She had one son, Jorge Omir. Today, her collection of books, magazines, statues, paintings, handicrafts, photographs, and personal correspondence is on display at the Federal University of S√£o Carlos in S√£o Paulo.

The regiment's first uniform consisted of; black tricone (officers in bicorne), red turnbacks, dark green jacket, dark green breeches, dark green gaiters, black boots, dark green pockets, red trimmed dark green pockets, red trimmed dark green cuffs, red cuff flaps, and white buttons.Lienhart & Humbet, pp. 57‚Äì58.Smith, Uniforms of the Napoleonic Wars, p. 42‚Äì47.  Revolution  In the Spring in 1791, the battalion moved into Monaco, and it was here when provisional regulations were published to un-royalise the army. On 1 April 1791, provisional regulations were announced following the initial stages of the French Revolution, and the regiment renamed as the 1er Bataillon de Chasseurs (Provence), but they continued to be known as their former title until 1792. In addition to the new title, the regiment adopted a new uniform; peak casque, with stiff black horsehair crest and mock leopard skin turban helmet, red turnbacks, dark green jacket, dark green breeches, dark green gaiters, black boots, dark green pockets, red trimmed dark green pockets, red trimmed dark green cuffs, red cuff flaps, and white buttons.  War of the First Coalition  When the War of the First Coalition broke out, the battalion was still in Monaco, but quickly ordered to Huningue and took part in much of the early operations along the Rhine. At the end of the year, the battalion was again quickly moved, this time to the Pyrenees region, just as the Kingdom of Spain join the war on the side of the allies. Upon arriving in the area, the battalion join the garrison of Saint-Gaudens and subsequently joined the Army of the Pyrenees Arm√©e des Pyr√©n√©es. In March 1793, the battalion moved into the Val d'Aran (Aran Valley) and joined the newly forming Army of the Western Pyrenees Arm√©e des Pyr√©n√©es Occidentales. During the expedition into the Val d'Aran, the battalion formed the extreme vanguard, but during the entire expedition only suffered two men killed and five wounded. In 1794, the battalion was transferred to the Army of Eastern Pyrennes Arm√©e des Pyr√©n√©es Orientales. The years following the Revolution saw great changes for the French Army: the old royalist infantry regiments were to serve as the stiffening for the tens of thousands of new volunteers who answered the patriotic Lev√©e en masse. In the First Amalgamation of 1794, each old royalist battalion was put together with two new volunteers battalions to become new Demi-Brigade de Bataille or Demi-Brigade of Battle. Therefore, on 16 June 1795, the battalion amalgamated with the 9th Battalion of Is√®re and 1st French Battalion of the Republic to form the 1er Demi-Brigade L√©g√®re, thus ending the royalist lineage and traditions.Smith, Napoleon's Regiments, pp. 195‚Äì196.

During most of that time it was the second-most popular Malay-language Chinese newspaper in the Indies after Sin Po. It was also an important paper in the early period of Indonesian independence in the 1950s. History=Dutch East Indies Keng Po was founded in Batavia, Dutch East Indies in 1923 by Hauw Tek Kong, an English-educated journalist and Chinese activist who had been director of the competing paper Sin Po in the 1910s, and had been banned from the Indies from 1919 until 1922 for his anti-Dutch views. Hauw apparently founded the paper in the midst of disagreement with Tjoe Bou San of Sin Po. Upon founding the paper he appointed himself director and editor-in- chief. Khoe Woen Sioe, who would be director of the paper in later years, joined as an editor at some point in the early years. In 1925 Khoe was arrested in a high-profile Persdelict (press offense) case for an article he published which criticized the hate speech laws in the Indies which fell very harshly upon native and Chinese editors and writers. His case itself was not noteworthy, but rather his poor treatment in the prison in Glodok became the subject of discussion in the Dutch language press of the Indies, which took offense at the sight of a 20-year old journalist being paraded in front of the public in shackles and chains without having been found guilty of anything. He was eventually sentenced to 3 months imprisonment. When Hauw Tek Kong, the founder of Keng Po, died in April of 1928, one of his former colleagues from Sin Po, Lauw Giok Lan, became the new editor-in-chief. However, he fell ill and did not stay in the position for long. Nio Joe Lan, who had recently been invited to the paper by Lauw, a family friend, was then made editor-in-chief. In the spring of 1932 another editor of Keng Po, Tan Boen Soan, left to become editor-in-chief of a competing paper, Warna Warta. In 1935 Keng Po went through a period of further reorganization; among the changes, Nio Joe Lan left the paper to join Sin Po. In early 1939, two editors of Keng Po, Zain Sanibar and Injo Beng Goat were brought to court under a Persdelict (press offence) over an article they had printed about the Regent of Pandeglang a year earlier. Almost immediately Injo was brought before the court once again for an insulting article he printed about Adolf Hitler, calling him a fool who had been unpopular in school, bad with women, constantly having suicidal thoughts, an illegitimate child, and so on.. When brought before a magistrate in Batavia, Injo was unrepentant and did not think he had done anything wrong, but merely described Hitler accurately. Indonesia Keng Po emerged in the new era of Indonesian independence as one of the most popular newspapers in the country, and a strong voice of independent opposition. However, before long the paper chafed against the increasingly restrictive treatment of the press by the Indonesian government. Injo Beng Goat, who remained editor in the new era, was arrested in the 1957 for printing content that was seen as disloyal to President Sukarno. The newspaper was also temporarily banned from publication during that time. Khoe Woen Sioe remained director of Keng Po in the independence era, as well as some other papers such as Star Weekly. In 1958, in the middle of an official campaign against Chinese language and symbols from the Indonesian government, Keng Po changed its name to Pos Indonesia (Indonesian: Indonesia Post). It ceased publication in the 1960s.

Reduced to a duo of John Campbell and Jarvis Whitehead, It's Immaterial recorded the album with producer Calum Malcolm in his Castlesound studios in Pencaitland, Scotland, having chosen him for his keyboard skills and work with the Blue Nile. With Malcolm, the duo spent a lengthy time recording the record with meticulous sessions that incorporated extensive homemade sampling, including some samples recorded outdoors. The album features a synthesised, evocative sound with flowing, repetitive musical patterns and songs which ignored traditional song structures by forgoing choruses. Campbell's story-like lyrics feature an English feel with their suburban settings and references to people and place names he knew in the North of England. Promoted by the single \\"Heaven Knows\\", Song was a commercial failure with its experimental style out of step with the popular music of its time. However, it was hailed by critics for its unique, adventurous style and clever lyrics. The album was re-released by Cherry Red Records in 2009. Background With their 1986 single \\"Driving Away From Home (Jim's Tune)\\", the Liverpool-based It's Immaterial had a UK Top 20 hit, while the album Life's Hard and Then You Die reached number 62 in the corresponding album chart. Following the release of further singles from their album, \\"Eds Funky Dinner\\" and \\"Space (He Called from the Kitchen)\\", the group left the public eye and downsized to a principal duo of John Campbell and Jarvis Whitehead. A planned tour with Les Rita Mitsouko was cancelled following a fall out between the artists. After touring Europe in support of Life's Hard, It's Immaterial returned to Britain in 1987 and began demoing material for Song in a small rehearsal studio fitted with a 16-track recorder. Ross Stapleton ‚Äì an A&R; worker at the duo's label Siren Records, owned by Virgin ‚Äì felt from the duo's demos that they would find recording the album a struggle, especially given the group's previous moments of writer's block. The duo picked producer Calum Malcolm for Song based on his engineering of the Blue Nile's A Walk Across the Rooftops (1984); he accepted based on the duo's primitive song ideas alone, which Campbell described as \\"just a calling card: some chords and some words. They weren't songs. They were just, 'This is the kind of thing that we might like to explore.'\\" Though Stapleton felt Malcolm was \\"an inspired choice,\\" he feared it would result in a \\"masterwork of brilliance\\" which would fail commercially after the group's more radio-friendly debut. Recording In March 1988, the duo moved to East Lothian, Scotland to begin recording the album at Malcolm's Pencaitland countryside studio Castlesound, which he operated in a former schoolhouse. Malcolm \\"gradually dismantled\\" the duo's songs until, as Campbell says, \\"this whole new way of working revealed itself,\\" with the producer adding atmospheric drones and arpeggios. He favoured space and quietness in the production, and worked with the duo to create an album with \\"the required 'emotional hit'\\"; they also knew Siren Records would soon close, which Campbell believed due to Virgin owner Ricahrd Branson being focused on his airline business, so saw the album as a chance to make one \\"that has everything about you in it.\\" Recording in the Scottish countryside, Campbell felt the area contributed to the album's \\"very open and languid\\" sound, which he felt would have contrasted a more frenetic feel had the album been recorded in a city, and resultingly the duo and Malcolm generally worked in isolation, a departure from the \\"many different people\\" involved in Life's Hard. One reason the duo chose Malcolm was his keyboard skills, which Whitehead described as \\"very subtle; every note he plays is designed to enhance the song. In that sense he's very 'efficient'.\\" As they had with their first album, the group used the Roland TR-808 drum machine, but moved the acoustic piano further back into the mix. Song also features many samples, and excepting some sounds taken from the E-mu Emulator library, these were created by the band, including numerous recorded outside, on one instance travelling to the East Lothian coast to sample castanets in a cave. Rather than create digital reverb, Malcolm used natural reverb in a room at Castlesound, where he and the duo spent time experimenting with different instruments. The duo also used many percussive samples on Song, taken from a range of ethnic instruments left behind in the studio by the Blue Nile percussionist Nigel Thomas. Campbell felt aware that \\"there are certain traps you can fall into,\\" so the duo used a variety of sounds to build up a sense of rhythm on the album's material, as opposed to \\"deliberately trying to find something different.\\" The duo spent months with Malcolm trying to create \\"a particular kind of tension\\" for the album; Campbell explained: \\"In a sense it's a sort of controlled emotion; it's not quite letting go at any point. That's what was interesting me at the time. You get the impression that something's just about to happen in the narrative, but it never quite does.\\" By 1989, It's Immaterial had only completed one song and spent much time contemplating whether to create a long form music video for Song, about which rumours spread in late 1989. Whitehead says: \\"There certainly wasn't any commercial success to speak of, we're just fortunate in having a rather gracious record company who allow us to work at our own pace.\\" Campbell recalls that, when it came to writing the final song, the duo decided to \\"roll up our sleeves and write the single which we can use to sell the other nice songs.\\" However, after a year of trying to achieve this, including changing the EQ of certain instruments on their recordings, they found this unsuccessful. He reflected: \\"We couldn't bear to go through with it. It isn't that we don't want to do anything commercial, it just doesn't seem to work for us.\\" Composition Unlike Life's Hard, which collected songs written since the band was formed, Song was conceived as a ten-song album. Stylistically, is characterised by Whitehead's flowing, repetitive musical patterns, largely based around piano, and Campbell's songs which are both sung and spoken. Considered by critic Dave Schulps to be \\"more a collection of stories put to music than actual songs,\\" due to the absence of choruses, Song instead moves beyond the traditional pop song format and showcases introspective sounds, with an atmospheric, synth-heavy pop sound with \\"skimpy drumbeats, plinking pianos and pastel flourishes,\\" according to critic Peter Kane. According to writer Colin Larkin, \\"the music was of a subdued, understated nature, with wry wit in the manner of an indie Pet Shop Boys.\\"Larkin, C. (2003) The Virgin Encyclodepia of 80's Music, Muze, London, p. 264, Musical influences on Song included Karlheinz Stockhausen, Philip Glass, Dead Can Dance, Talking Heads and OMD, while biographer Malcolm Dome noted elements of blues, country, folk and new wave styles within the album's \\"electronica pulse\\". \\"An Ordinary Life\\" was inspired by the short story Bernice Bobs Her Hair (1920 illustration by May Wilson Preston depicted). Campbell began writing the songs using expressions he had discovered and incorporated his own experiences around them. Many of the names in the songs refer to his friends, and the locations are largely real places he has visited, creating an \\"English feel\\" he felt was a natural reaction against Americanisms. According to journalist Penny Kiley, \\"a sense of place is strong in every song. Each song is a story and the Liverpool-based Mancunians have set them firmly in the North of England.\\" Nigel Lord of Music Technology highlights the \\"underlying Englishness\\" that Song has in common with the first album, citing \\"a pre-occupation with suburbia, out-of-season holiday towns and drab Sunday afternoons - all traditional English themes.\\" Wyndham Wallace of Classic Pop felt the songs to be poignant, sensitive portrayals of \\"the minutiae of Thatcher-era working class life\\" and compared them to Shelagh Delaney. \\"Endless Holiday\\" concerns a desperate, unemployed househusband, while \\"Heaven Knows\\" depicts a \\"financially overstretched suburban existence\\", according to Wallace. \\"An Ordinary Life\\", meanwhile, was inspired by the short story Bernice Bobs Her Hair (1920) by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and documents a lonely Mr Hart's infatuation with a checkout girl named Bernice. \\"New Brighton\\" refers both to the town of that name and a 'frame of mind'; Campbell explained: \\"Everybody's going out and you're the stubborn one in a way because you quite like it. I like New Brighton, I wouldn't mind staying there.\\" \\"Heaven Knows\\" was released as a double A-side single with the non-album song \\"River\\", backed with the B-side \\"Faith\\". Release and reception While the evocative, experimental nature of Song was not strictly commercial, It's Immaterial hoped the album would attract \\"the sort of people who make the effort to listen closely to music\\", according to journalist Penny Kiley. The duo planned to proceed with making the \\"long-form video\\" to accompany Song if the album was commercially successful. The album was released in June 1990 by Siren Records, in a sleeve featuring David Bomberg's 1948 painting Mount St Hilarion and the Castle Ruins. Failing to reach the UK Albums Chart, Song proved a commercial flop. Wallace recalled that \\"with street-friendly dance music like Happy Mondays and Soul II Soul in the ascendant, by the time the record was released in 1990 it tanked. Having toiled interminably over it ‚Äì much as Talk Talk did with Spirit of Eden ‚Äì they watched it disappear, seemingly without trace.\\" Campbell reflected that there \\"wasn't really a hope in hell\\" for the album to be successful, referring to its commercial response as \\"the mood of the record\\". Despite its poor sales, Song was critically acclaimed for its unique sound. Peter Kane of Q described the album as exploring the rich potential for \\"atmospheric synthersizer pop\\", with conversational songs of \\"quiet desperation\\" bearing tenderness and dour humour to \\"accompany the often crippling hurt of life and love among the ruins,\\" ultimately hailing it \\"a sizeable achievement\\". A reviewer for Hi-Fi News & Record Review wrote that the album's \\"soft soporific sounds envelope clever lyrical exercises\\" in a manner comparable to the Blue Nile. Dave Schulps of Trouser Press described the album as often hypnotic, sounding \\"something like Philip Glass meets Marc Almond\\", but felt listeners may find the record \\"a bit tedious\\" if they were not drawn in by the lyrics, concluding: \\"This is music best listened to when distractions are at a minimum; don't expect to hear it in dance clubs.\\" Penny Kiley of the Liverpool Echo recommended Song in her \\"albums of the month\\" column. In a more reserved review, Glenn Rice of Select praised It's Immaterial for approaching their \\"gloomy\\" subjects \\"sort of sideways on\\", with whispered vocals and instrumentation that together suggest \\"a more subdued Pet Shop Boys\\", but felt the band seemed disengaged and unenthusiastic, describing Song as \\"the pop equivalent of a Lowry painting ‚Äì simplistic, flat and populated by workaday characters fostering ideas of escape from life's dreariness.\\" Alistair Mabbott of The List considered the uncommercial sound of the album disappointing, adding that if the duo \\"intended it to be leavened by a dose of quirky humour, it hasn't worked.\\" He also compared Campbell's unfavourably with Paul Buchanan of the Blue Nile, a band he noted the album's \\"sustained mood and melancholy\\" was texturally similar to. Legacy Held in high esteem by It's Immaterial fans, Song was retrospectively described by Whitehead as \\"the It's Immaterial idea to an extreme,\\" while Campbell said that he and Whitehead \\"were very proud of what we'd offered. If you look at what you're trying to produce as works of art, I actually thought Song was the nearest I'd got to something that would actually stand the test of time. And I think it's proven that.\\" In 2009, Song was reissued by Cherry Red Records with bonus B-sides from the \\"Heaven Knows\\" single and liner notes from Malcolm Dome. In the liner notes, Dome said that although Song was not progressive rock, it was still an album of progressive music with \\"the precursors of what others have taken into the 21st Century\\", and called it \\"a work of art ‚Äì modern art rock, if you like\\".

HEA-NPs possess a wide range of compositional library, distinct alloy mixing structure, and nanoscale size effect, enabling their huge potential in catalysis, energy, environmental and biomedical applications.  Enabling synthesis  HEA-NPs are a structural analog to bulk HEA but synthesized at the nanoscale. The formation of HEAs requires a high temperature for multi- element mixing; however, high temperature is against nano-material synthesis due to high temperature-induced structure aggregation and surface reconstruction. In 2018, HEA-NPs were firstly synthesized by a carbothermal shock synthesis. The carbothermal shock employs a rapid high temperature heating (e.g. 2000 K, in 55 ms) to enable the non-equilibrium synthesis of HEA-NPs with uniform size and homogeneous mixing despite containing immiscible combinations. The material and technology are also patented. Later, other similar non-equilibrium ‚Äúshock‚Äù methods were also introduced to synthesize HEA-NPs and other types of high entropy nanostructures.  Properties and applications  HEA-NPs have a large compositional library, which enables tunability in chemical composition, structure, and associated properties. In addition, owing to the high entropy structure, HEA-NPs typically show improved structural stability. With the above merits, HEA-NPs have been used as high- performance catalysts for both thermochemical and electrochemical reactions, such as ammonia oxidation, decomposition, and water splitting.

Note: The map alongside presents some of the notable locations in the subdivision. All places marked in the map are linked in the larger full screen map. The temple The beginning of Baneswar Shiva temple is mired in mythology. According to popular belief the legendary Raja Banasura, an ardent devotee of Shiva had made the latter agree to come down to earth. When Shiva was following Raja Banasura, the latter suddenly stopped at Baneswar (earlier name Gordasandara), which was a breach of agreement. Shiva instantly disappeared and later established a Shiva-linga on the banks of the Bangti River. Many believe that the place was named after the Raja. However, there is no mention of the temple in the legend. According to some, the temple was built by Raja Jalpeswar, who built the Jalpesh temple. He is believed to have ruled in the second or third century and is mentioned in ‚ÄòJalpesh Mahatya‚Äô. Some others think that Raja Nilambar of the Khen dynasty had built it. Yet others think that Maharaja Nara Narayan of the Koch dynasty established it and Maharaja Pran Narayan of the Cooch Behar State subsequently revamped it. The present structure is squarish with a dome and a slightly curved cornish. It has two entrances -one on the west and the other in the east. The temple has a Shiva linga and a ‚ÄòGouripat‚Äô in the garbhagriha, below the plinth level. The temple was slightly tilted on the east during an earth-quake in 1897. It has a height of and the base measures square. The walls are thick. There are some decorated narrow strips on the walls. It has a raised platform in the front. There is a bull made of cement on the right. On the northern side there is a tin shed housing idols of Shiva and ‚Äòardhanariswar‚Äô. There are some other idols also, including a Kali idol in another shed. There is a big pond nearby with many tortoises. A week-long fair is held during Shiva Chaturdashi.

The killer was described as a true sexual sadist, and possible sufferer of clinical vampirism.  History  During the 1960s, citizens of Cali lived in fear and uncertainty, as children and adolescents began disappearing from the area. On November 5, 1963, the body of a paperboy was found in western Cali. After that, more cases of murdered young boys began cropping up. On December 4th, another boy was found on some grassland in the northern area of the city, in what is considered the second recorded homicide. Eight days later, a third body, lacking eyeballs, was discovered on the shores of the Aguacatal River. Two more bodies were discovered before the end of the year: one near the railway station and the other in Prados del Norte.Johnny Delgado M. (May 3, 2014).

In January 1964, Cali police found the mummified body of another boy; two days after, the remains of 12-year-old Alberto Garz√≥n were discovered. Another three corpses were found in the same month, in different sectors of the town. Between February and April, there were an additional three murders: one very close to Tequendama, another in Puerto Mallarino and the last at a potrero. Faced with this wave of murders, the authorities sent a series of notices to the public, claiming that these bodies were likely taken from cemeteries and later scattered around Cali, mostly in solitary areas. Despite this, much of the press and public demanded that the killings be solved, and the terror finally put to an end. The crimes ceased for several months, although more cases were reported again in late 1964. All of these events are believed to have claimed the lives of between 30 to 38 young boys and men. The perpetrator was never captured, and he was later nicknamed the \\"Monster of the Mangones\\".  Film adaptation  The case led to the creation of a film titled Pura sangre, by director Luis Ospina. The story tells about a man who needs fresh blood from children and teenagers, as he suffered from a peculiar disease. The film was released in 1982, with most of the scenes shot in Cali and one in New York City; it cost 16 million Colombian pesos, and premiered at the Cartagena Film Festival, where it was considered the \\"first Colombian horror film with international quality\\".A delivery that ends Revista Semana.

She was active as a Communist militant in the French resistance during the second world war. A member of the French Communist Party, she was expelled after accusations of Trotskyism and having participated in summary executions of accused former National Socialist collaborators. In 1980, Althusser murdered Rytmann by strangulation. The murder of Rytmann attracted much attention from the French media and there were requests to sentence Althusser as an ordinary criminal, but he was instead declared unfit to stand trial by reason of insanity and committed to a psychiatric institution for three years. Early life Rytmann was born in Paris in 1910. Her Jewish family was of Russian/Lithuanian origin. According to Althusser, Rytmann was sexually abused as a child by her family doctor. At age 13, the doctor forced Rytmann to administer a lethal dose of morphine to her father who was suffering from terminal cancer; the following year, Rytmann was forced to administer another lethal dose to her terminally ill mother. However, this story could have been invented by Althusser, who admitted to incorporating \\"imagined memories\\" into his \\"traumabiography.\\" Resistance activities During the German occupation of France, Rytmann refused to wear the yellow star mandated by the Third Reich and instead joined the French resistance. As a militant, she was a comrade of Jean Beaufret and was affiliated with the \\"Pericles\\" division of the French resistance. She joined the French Communist Party, but was later expelled for \\"Trotskyist deviation\\" and \\"crimes\\". It was alleged that she had participated in summary executions of former Nazi collaborators in Lyon. Murder On 16 November, Rytmann was murdered by her husband by strangulation at their apartment at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure. Her husband was massaging her neck when he crushed her larynx and killed her. The murder was never thoroughly investigated. In January 1981, Althusser was deemed unfit to serve trial under Article 64 of the French penal code, with Althusser claiming \\"diminished responsibility\\" due to mental illness. Rytmann is buried in the Jewish section of Cimeti√®re parisien de Bagneux in Paris. Legacy John Banville's 2002 novel Shroud was partly inspired by the scandal of Rytmann's murder.

She was a leading member of the Freedom of Labour Defence who argued for equal rights for women in the workplace.  Life  Vynne was born in Kennington in 1857. She would spend some of her childhood in Rickerby in the Lake District where she was home schooled. Her first job was in the highlands of Scotland where she was a teacher at Peterhead in Aberdeenshire. In 1881 her father, Charles Vynne, died and she moved to London. Her mother, Sarah Anne Vynne (born Clarke) was still living. In London she took to writing short pieces for magazines including Winter's Weekly. Winter's Weekly was edited by John Strange Winter which was the nom de plume of Henrietta Stannard and it was to him (her) that she dedicated her first book, The Blind Artist's Pictures and Other Stories, in 1893. Stannard had included her stories in the first issues of Winter's Weekly and she had placed Vynne's picture on the cover of one issue. Vynne's short stories were a success and J. M. Barrie described them as \\"the best\\". She published another collection the following year and in 1895 she published A Man and his Womankind which was her first novel. In 1896 she was able to use her teaching skills and her reputation as a writer to establish a school of writing which operated by post and via the pages of the magazine Atalanta. Subscribers paid ten shillings a year to submit stories that were read and evaluated by Vynne. At the end of the year the best writer was awarded a ¬£20 scholarship. She was a leading member of the Freedom of Labour Defence who argued for equal rights for women in the workplace. In 1903 her non-fiction collaboration with Helen Blackburn was looking at Women under the Factory Act. They criticised legislators for treating women as if they had not the intelligence of animals as if they always needed to be cared for to protect them. They argued that women should be allowed to take risks with their health in the workplace or they may find themselves always in need to protection as if they were incapable. The book was noted for its accuracy, but the Economic Journal recognised its authors as Freedom of Labour Defence members and suspected that it may be arguing for the \\"equality of men and women\\". She created the magazine Women and Progress out of the remains of Christiana Herringham's Women's Tribune which started and ended publication in 1906. Vynne's new publication had herself and the well connected suffragist Lady Frances Balfour as joint editors. The magazine was dedicated to achieving equal citizen rights for men and women. They were happy to see younger women excluded from having the vote as long as it applied equally to young men as well. The magazine appeared to be about to be a success when shortage of funds obliged it to fold in June 1914. Today the magazine serves as a good source of early suffragette history. After she died it became apparent that Vynne had lied a lot about her age.

She began as an archaeological and historical researcher before accepting an invitation to become an librarian at Ashburne Hall, University of Manchester in 1935. Murray went on to become assistant tutor and registrar at Girton College, Cambridge from 1938 to 1948. From May 1948 to 1970, she was principal of Bishop Otter College in Chichester, West Sussex, overseeing an extensive construction program and introduced co-education to the college. Murray was chair of the council and later president of the Sussex Archaeological Society and published a biography on her maternal grandfather James Murray in 1978. After her death, she left gifts to several organisations in her will. Early life Murray was born on 3 December 1909, at Seatoller, 3 Hills Road, Trumpington, near Cambridge. She was the third child of the inspector of schools and author H. J. R. Murray and his wife, Kate Maitland, Crosthwaite, an amateur violinist and women's suffragette participant. Murray's maternal grandfather was James Murray, the lexicographer. She had two brothers, one of whom was the archaeologist Kenneth Murray; she was strongly influenced by both her sibilings. Murray was educated at three schools because her father moved around: Edgbaston High School, Birmingham, St Paul's Girls' School, London and Colchester County High School; she became interested in archaeology at Colchester. In 1928, she was accepted to read modern history at Somerville College, Oxford, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1931. Murray embarked on archaeological and historical research, and was elected to study a Bachelor of Letters degree with the Rosa Hovey research scholarship. She graduated in 1933 with the thesis The Constitutional History of the Cinque Ports, which was published two years later. Career Murray thought about a career as a factory inspector but was strongly attracted to academia. During this period, she was chair of the Oxford University Archaeological Society and won a Mond scholarship to work with the Samaria excavation expedition in 1933, specially the Ahab's Palace. Murray spent 1935 to 1937 working in an administrative role as a librarian and tutor on the women's hall of residence at Ashburne Hall, University of Manchester. In 1938, she was invited to work at Girton College, Cambridge and was appointed assistant tutor in charge of student welfare and registrar. Four years later, Murray was promoted to domestic bursar followed by the role of junior bursar from 1944 to 1948. She was on the Special Purposes Committee responsible for a plethora of the daily organisation and domestic staff. In 1948, Murray was offered the role of Principal of Bishop Otter College, an Anglican college in Chichester, West Sussex. She began in the role in May that year, following a 13 to 5 vote by council members despite concerns about her lack of professional expertise and the attitude she displayed at her interview. Murray began a three-year course at the college and introduced male students to the all-female institution. She oversaw an extensive construction programme, which introduced a new assembly hall, a chapel on the former kitchen garden, a dining hall, teaching rooms and individual student bedrooms in place of the dormitory accommodation. Murray purchased sculptures and pictures from the likes of Henry Moore, Stanley Spencer and Graham Sutherland, and invited national figures to speak to staff and students at the college. She also introduced co-education, instituted responsibility for self-appraisal in student matters and grew the college's governing body. By the time of Murray's retirement in 1970, the college had grown in size in terms of student numbers training at all levels. In retirement, she accessed the papers of her grandfather James Murray and prepared a biography of him Caught in the Web of Words, which was published in 1977 and received critical praise from general readers and scholars in the United Kingdom and the United States. The book won Murray a British Academy prize for English Literature and honourary degrees from the University of Sussex and the United States. She was an independent Councillor on Chichester District Council from 1973 to 1987, and was vice-chair of its planning committee from 1976. Murray was chair of the council at the Sussex Archaeological Society from 1964 to 1977, and served as president between 1977 and 1980. She helped to organise excavations at Bignor and Fishbourne Roman Palace. Murray helped to establish Pallant House Gallery, was a fellow of the Royal Historical Society and the Society of Antiquaries, served on the Sussex Historic Churches Trust and the Society of Sussex Downsmen. Personal life She was a member of the Church of England. Murray died of bronchopneumonia at the Pendean Nursing Home, West Lavington, West Sussex close to Midhurst on 6 February 1998. She did not marry. Murray's funeral was held on six days later in Heyshott, Sussex and was cremated in Chichester with her ashes interred in October 1998. On 15 May, a thanksgiving service was held for her at Chichester Cathedral. Legacy Murray had a wide circle of friends and was open to many types of individual and the conditions of the people. She was tenacious, vitality and had a sense of enjoyment. In Murray's will, she donated gifts from her estate to Christian Aid, Heyshott Church, Pallant House Gallery, Somerville College and the Sussex Historic Churches Trust.

The church's distance from Nordby meant that the villagers were unable to hear the church bell, so a bell tower was built in the 1600s in the center of Nordby, on a small plaza known locally as Galgepladsen. This plaza is also where the village's pillory was located until 1820. The current version of the village's bell tower was built in 1857. Other than church events, the bell tower also rang to warn against fires or when an animal was butchered and its meat sold on the plaza. Until 2011 the gravedigger of Nordby Church rang the bell. Today an organisation of volunteers, known as Ringelauget, ring the bell.

Yugoslavia recognized East Germany on 15 October 1957. Decision to recognize East Germany pushed West Germany to apply the Hallstein Doctrine for the first time in history, limiting relations almost exclusively to the economics field for eleven years (until 1968) until the initiation of the Ostpolitik. At the time, Yugoslav citizens were one of the largest groups of Gastarbeiters. Significantly smaller Yugoslav community lived in East Berlin, mostly as diplomatic and economic cooperation representatives. Yugoslavia recognized East Germany as a part of its efforts to improve relations with the Soviet Union after the 1948 Tito‚ÄìStalin split. At the time 1955 Belgrade declaration was signed and Yugoslavia verbally supported 1956 Soviet Intervention in Hungary. This support was diametrically opposite to future Belgrade's strong opposition to the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia which led to second rapprochement between Yugoslavia and the Western Bloc. During the September 1964 official visit to the People's Republic of Bulgaria (conducted by train) Walter Ulbricht, the Chairman of the East German State Council, unofficially visited Belgrade where he met Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito. Contrary to countries of the Eastern Bloc, Yugoslav State Security Administration never developed substantial cooperation with East German Stasi due to continual ideological and political antagonism between Belgrade and East Berlin.

Andrej Babi≈°'s ANO 2011 has been described as \\"an extreme form of a business-firm party\\". An business-firm party, entrepreneurial party, or personal party is a type of political party that is centered on a charismatic political entrepreneur, most often created by that person to further their own interests. Definition It can be considered \\"the most extreme case of party personalization, consisting in the full control by an individual leader of the party he has himself created\\", in the words of political scientist Mauro Calise. A business-firm party is modeled off the top-down organizational structure of a corporation as opposed to operating on the basis of internal party democracy. The party structure is related to the older type of elite party, but is even more strongly oligarchic in form, as the political entrepreneur maintains complete control of the party's assets. The entrepreneur controls all aspects of the party's platform and campaigning, plays the ultimate role in selecting candidates to run in elections, managing the party's resources, and wielding party discipline over other politicians in the party. One characteristic distinguishing them from other parties is that the party organization is either dormant or limited outside of campaign seasons, and members are actively discouraged from becoming more involved in the party, therefore leading entrepreneurial parties to lack grassroots capacity. Entrepreneurial parties may have only one member, the party leader (as in the case of Party for Freedom or the Ticino League), or very few aside from politicians. The Party for Freedom initially did not recruit members out of fear of infiltration by the far-right; later, deputy leader Martin Bosma said that a party membership structure interfered with direct accountability between party leadership and voters. In a completely memberless business-firm party, volunteers, donors, and officeholders invest time, money, and their reputation (if the party is controversial) without any formal say in the party's operations. Causes and effects More monocratic systems of government, such as presidential systems, tend to encourage the formation of personal parties while the personalization of politics fuels the centralization of power. Entrepreneurial parties tend to be short-lived and rarely outlast their founders, except where the entrepreneur is successful in using his charisma to build a mass-membership party, as in the case of the True Finns. Due to the lack of grassroots mobilization, leader-oriented parties may be less successful in local and regional politics, which are more distant from the charismatic leader, as occurred with ANO 2011 and Forza Italia. Entrepreneurial parties are commonly far-right, nationalist, and/or populist. However, another tendency is not to have a firm ideology and instead closely follow opinion polls while being vague or self-contradictory on the party's standpoint. Tatiana Kostadinova and Barry Levitt argue that in a personalist party, \\"interactions between the leader and other politicians are driven mainly by loyalty to that leader rather than, for example, organizational rules, ideological affinities, or programmatic commitments\\". Business-firm parties are likely to emerge in new democracies and in situations of high electoral volatility. They may also result from declines in political participation and membership in traditional parties. In central Europe, entrepreneurial parties have formed as a type of state capture where state powers are used for private benefit. Entrepreneurial parties are especially common in Latin America. Constitutionality The Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany requires that political parties \\"conform to democratic principles\\" in their internal organization.Wise, Judith (1998) \\"Dissent and the Militant Democracy: The German Constitution and the Banning of the Free German WorkersParty,\\"The University of Chicago Law School Roundtable: Vol. 5: Iss. 1, Article 11.Available at:http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/roundtable/vol5/iss1/11 When the Socialist Reich Party was banned in 1952, the Federal Constitutional Court's judgement stated: \\"If a party's internal organization does not correspond to democratic principles, one may generally conclude that the party seeks to impose upon the state the structural principles that it has implemented within its own organization.\\" The constitutions of Portugal, Spain, Argentina, and Turkey include similar provisions. Israeli jurist argues that non- democratically organized parties are undesirable because \\"There is a greater likelihood of the pursuit of nondemocratic goals in parties that have a nondemocratic structure.\\" Examples=AsiaIndonesia= *Perindo (Hary Tanoesoedibjo) =Thailand= *Thai Rak Thai Party (Thaksin Shinawatra) =Turkey= *Rights and Equality Party *Young Party EuropeAustria= *Freedom Party of Austria under J√∂rg Haider's leadership *Team Stronach for Austria (Frank Stronach) =Belgium= *Lijst Dedecker (Jean-Marie Dedecker) =Czech Republic= *Public Affairs (V√≠t B√°rta) *ANO 2011 (Andrej Babi≈°) *Dawn of Direct Democracy (Tomio Okamura) *Freedom and Direct Democracy (Okamura) =Finland= *True Finns =France= *National Rally =Hungary= *Fidesz (Viktor Orb√°n) =Italy= *Forza Italia (Silvio Berlusconi) *Popolo della Libert√† (Berlusconi) *Italy of Values (Antonio Di Pietro) =Netherlands= *Pim Fortuyn List *Party for Freedom (Geert Wilders) =Norway= *Progress Party (Anders Lange) =Poland= *Modern (Ryszard Petru) *Kukiz'15 (Pawe≈Ç Kukiz) *Palikot Movement (Janusz Palikot) =Romania= *People's Party ‚Äì Dan Diaconescu =Slovakia= *Freedom and Solidarity (Richard Sul√≠k) *We Are Family (Boris Koll√°r) *Ordinary People and Independent Personalities (Igor Matoviƒç) =Spain= *Union of the Democratic Centre (Adolfo Su√°rez) =Switzerland= *Ticino League (Giuliano Bignasca) OceaniaAustralia= *Tasmanian Independent Senator Brian Harradine Group (Brian Harradine) *John Madigan's Manufacturing and Farming Party *Katter's Australian Party (Bob Katter) *Palmer United Party (Clive Palmer) *Glenn Lazarus Team (Glenn Lazarus) *Jacqui Lambie Network (Jacqui Lambie) South AmericaPeru= *Cambio 90 (Alberto Fujimori) *S√≠ Cumple (Fujimori) *Peru 2000 (Fujimori) See also *Authoritarian leadership style *Trumpism ReferencesFurther reading  Category:Ethically disputed political practices Category:Types of political parties ","title":"Business-firm party"},{"id":"64816964","text":"The Buddenbrooks (German: Die Buddenbrooks) is a television series which originally aired on ARD in 1979.Kliemann p. 78 Based on the 1901 novel Buddenbrooks by Thomas Mann, it was made as a co-production between France and West Germany.

He was arrested thanks to DNA profiling, fully admitting his guilt at trial, for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a chance of parole.  Biography  On December 23, 1997, Rembert got into an argument with 24-year- old Dadren Lewis at a parking lot, which resulted in Lewis being shot. At trial, his lawyers managed to convince the judge that it was unintentional, and in 1998, Robert was found guilty of manslaughter and served 6 years in jail. After his release, Rembert returned to Cleveland and found a job as a truck driver, frequently abusing alcohol and living on modest means. At the time of his arrest, he was having financial difficulties and problems with housing, due to which, shortly before his arrest, he had to live with relatives and friends.  Exposure  Robert was arrested on September 21, 2015, at a truck service stop in Medina County. He was driving an SUV that belonged to 26-year-old Morgan Nietzel, whose body had been found the previous day, along with that of 52-year-old Jerry Rembert, who was providing lodging for Robert. After his arrest, Robert admitted that on the previous evening, he got into an argument with his cousin Jerry, during which he shot him and Nietzel, a mutual friend of the two. After he killed them, Rembert stole several items and Morgan's car. During the subsequent investigation, a blood and saliva sample was taken from Robert for testing, from which he was linked to the murder of 31-year-old Kimberly Hall, who was found beaten and raped on June 10th of that year, and an older murder dating back to May 1997, when 47-year-old Rita May Payne was killed in Cleveland. Both women were prostitutes. During the investigation, Rembert accepted a plea bargain from the authorities, admitting to all the killings and providing details for each. He said that at the time of the Payne murder, he was working as a bus driver and killed the woman by luring her into a public service toilet at the Cleveland bus station. Despite the fact that bus drivers and station workers were investigated, Robert slipped by unnoticed. Due to his job as a truck driver, visiting many cities in Ohio and Pennsylvania, he was investigated in the murders of several other girls and women who were engaged in prostitution and were killed under similar circumstances. So far, no new charges have been brought against him.  Trial  On the basis of the plea bargain, Rembert was found guilty of four murders and on October 16, 2018, received a life imprisonment term with a chance of parole after 30 years. During the sentencing, he expressed remorse for what he had done and asked for forgiveness from the victims' relatives.

The exterior of the basilica The priory was built on the order of the Abbot of Cluny Abbey in the Benedictine order, with construction occurring around 1130. Monks from Cluny Abbey occupied the priory until the 17th century. The current structure was designed by Peter Thumb and was built between 1719‚Äì1723 after the original 12th-century structure was destroyed during the Thirty Years War. The basilica was later abandoned during the French Revolution. The current church was built in the Baroque style, with a number of typical Baroque features, such as ex- voto images along the walls, and an elaborate altarpiece. The most recent building works, taking place in 1932, saw the erection of a Baroque bell tower, topped with a bulbous dome. Today, the basilica draws hundreds of thousands of pilgrims a year, and is a significant site of pilgrimage in the Alsace region, especially for devotion to the Madonna with Child.  History  The origins of the priory date back to 730, when a number of Benedictine monks started a mission to convert the population of Alsace. Numerous churches were built by them in the 8th century in Alsace. The Cluniac mission built on the foundations of the Benedictine missions after the miraculous cure of a supposedly incurable disease inflicted upon a young man from Soultz. According to legend, he pledged to build a shrine to the Virgin Mary if he was cured. Attracted by these stories, a Cluniac mission was built in the town. The religious community never exceeded more than ten monks, and they were subservient to the mother monastery at Cluny. The priory existed for several centuries but was extensively attacked and damaged during the Middle Ages and in the Thirty Years War. The priory interior was heavily damaged in 1276 in a fire, and it was sacked by peasants in 1525. The archives of the early monastery and the church itself were extensively damaged deliberately during the Thirty Years War, in 1640. The ornate Baroque altarpiece of the basilica During the French Revolution, the priory was disbanded, but the church survived, despite many churches in the area being destroyed. The monks refused to sign the Constitution of the Clergy, but the pilgrimage was restored with the priory in 1801 as part of Napoleon Bonaparte's Concordat of 1801. The surrounding region was a frontline during the First World War, and was subject to artillery bombing, particularly at Old Armand and Sudel. Despite the proximity to the German-French border during the Second World War, the church was left relatively undamaged. Numerous side-chapels and other devotional centres were added, including a chapel dedicated to the Good Shepherd, which serves as the reliquary of the church, holding relics pertaining to many saints, including St Francis Xavier. The priory was restored and is a centre of pilgrimage in the area in the current day. Recent building works include the building of a bell tower in 1932. The church is also a centre of tourism, due to the history of the priory, and the ornate Baroque interiors and approximately 850 ex-voto images.  The Church Grounds  The church grounds contain a number of significant features. There is a calvary station, with a nearby fountain and well, as well as the remains of a chapel dedicated to St Anne, the Mother of Mary. The chapel of St Anne was built to replace the hermitage which had long stood on the site.

She is also a former parliamentary deputy, represented the United Civic Party of Belarus from 1995 to 2019 and served as an MP from 2016 to 2019. She is known for her political campaign on calling Belarus to be freed from Russian interference.  Biography  Hanna Kanapatskaya was born in the late Soviet era on 29 October 1976 in Minsk. Her father Anatoly Trukhanovich is a dollar millionaire and her mother is a housewife. She completed her education at the Minsk School no 55 and graduated from the Faculty of Law at the Belarusian State University.  Political career  She contested at the 2016 Belarusian parliamentary election representing the United Civic Party and was elected as a deputy of the House of Representatives. She won a seat in the 97th electoral district in the Kastryjƒçnickaja district of Minsk and was elected to the lower house of Belarus National Assembly as just one of only two opposition candidates along with Alena Anisim. The instance also made her and one other independent candidate to be the first opposition MPs being represented in parliament of Belarus since 2004. She stepped down from the position of parliamentary deputy in 2019 after a fallout with the United Civic Party following the 2019 Belarusian parliamentary election, where the party failed to receive any seats. She also reported to have run for the position of member of parliament in 2019 but the signatures were invalidated by the Central Election Commission of Belarus.  2020 presidential election  On 20 May 2020, she self nominated herself as an independent candidate as she decided to stand as an independent candidate following a fallout with United Civic Party in 2019.

On 10 June 2020, she claimed that she had received a total of 100,000 signatures as submissions to the Central Election Commission of Belarus and became the fourth candidate to receive 100,000 signatures and eventually became eligible to contest at the election. She also refused to take part in television debates prior to the election and during an interview in July 2020, she claimed that apart from President Alexander Lukashenko, other candidates were relatively weak and insisted that Lukashenko is the only major rival. She also revealed that she decided to run for presidency by claiming that people of Belarus have lost trust and confidence on Lukashenko's dictator rule for 26 years. On 10 August 2020, the election results were released and Hanna clinched third place among the candidates with a total valid vote count of 1.68%.

He is the last surviving wartime 617 ‚ÄòDambuster‚Äô Squadron pilot. He completed 30 operations before the cessation of hostilities in May 1945. He then served with Transport Command. He was awarded the L√©gion d‚Äôhonneur in 2016.  Early life  Benny was born in West London and educated at Herne Bay College in Kent, where he became a member of the Officer Training Corps. In 1937, he enrolled in an electrical engineering course prior to joining his father‚Äôs film and advertising business in London.  Second World War  Shortly after the outbreak of the war, Benny volunteered for the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve and was accepted for aircrew training. He joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1940. He was initially posted to RAF Abingdon as a ground gunner, before being posted to RAF Bridgenorth for general training. His initial flying training was conducted on Tiger Moths at Peterborough between June and August 1941. Benny completed his training at No. 33 Service Flying Training School (SFTS) at Carberry, Manitoba, and was awarded his flying badge on April 24, 1942, and commissioned as a Pilot Officer. He later became a flying instructor and trained at No. 8 Flying Instructor School, Reading before being sent as an instructor to No. 31 SFTS at Kingston, Ontario, to train Fleet Air Arm Pilots on the North American Harvard.  Return to the UK  Benny returned to the UK in September 1942 after an eventful passage across the Atlantic. He departed Halifax on a New Zealand Vessel carrying women and children in addition to troops. A day or so out from Halifax, an escorting American destroyer was torpedoed by a U-boat, and Benny‚Äôs vessel was holed, his kit (including his flying logbook) being temporarily lost in the incident. He arrived back in the UK on September 11, 1942, destined to train as a bomber pilot, after conversion to twin-engined aircraft, flying the Airspeed Oxford at No. 12 (Pilots) Advanced Flying Unit, Grantham. Promoted to Flying Officer, he graduated to the larger Vickers Wellington at No. 14 Operational Training Unit (OTU), Cottesmore, before transferring to No. 17 OTU at Silverstone to form his own crew. Benny was then promoted to Flight Lieutenant and was transferred to No. 1660 Conversion Unit at Swinderby.  Bomber Command  No. 617 (Dambusters) Squadron was a special duties Squadron within No. 5 Group, based at Woodhall Spa in Lincolnshire. Composed of experienced bomber crews, it was equipped with Barnes Wallis‚Äôs 12,000 lb ‚ÄúTallboy‚Äù Deep Penetration bomb and a precision bombsight that required high flying skills and crew teamwork to achieve extreme accuracy. Benny and his crew were part of an experiment by Air Vice-Marshal Sir Ralph Cochrane, Air Officer Commanding No. 5 Group, taking a few novice crews who were rated above average and who might quickly be able to assimilate the skills required to achieve No. 617 Squadron‚Äôs high standards. His first operation with No. 617 Sqn was on August 18, 1944, against the U-boat pens at La Pallice. Flying as a second pilot with one of the Squadron‚Äôs veteran crews, he familiarised himself with operational procedures. His first operation with his own crew, to Brest on 27 August, began eventfully when; shortly after takeoff, the wireless operator announced that his set was on fire. It was soon extinguished without significant damage and the crew continued on to their target. Benny flew on many notable operations. While waiting to take off for the Squadron‚Äôs second attack against the German battleship ‚ÄúTirpitz‚Äù (October 29, 1944) his aircraft narrowly avoided being hit on the ground by another aircraft which swung severely on take off. Returning from a deep penetration raid on the oil refinery at Politz (December 21/22, 1944), Benny alone brought his aircraft safely back to a fog- shrouded Woodhall Spa while the remainder of the Squadron was forced to divert to other airfields, one of them subsequently crashing owing to poor visibility. During an operation against Hamburg (April 9, 1945), the Squadron was attacked by Messerschmitt 262 jet fighters. While most of these operations were carried out using the Tallboy12,000lb bomb, Benny got the opportunity to drop a 22,000lb Grand Slam Deep Penetration bomb during an attack against the Arnsberg Viaduct (March 19, 1945). His bomb scored a direct hit.  Post-war RAF career  At the end of the war in Europe and completion of his first tour, Benny transferred to Transport Command, serving with Nos. 51 and 53 Squadrons, flying Short Stirlings. After demobilization, he became a member of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force in 1946, flying Spitfire XVIs with No. 604 (County of Middlesex) Squadron. He re-joined the RAF in August 1949 as a Flight Lieutenant, and after a course flying Wellingtons at the Pilot Refresher Flying School, Finningley underwent further conversion to the Handley Page Hastings. Benny joined No. 53 Sqn at Lyneham in March 1950, flying trooping movements to the Middle East and returning Korean War casualties, including Turkish, from Singapore. During a period spent on duties in Vienna and at the Air Ministry, London, Benny maintained his flying rating on a variety of types, including the Avro Anson, de Havilland Chipmunk, and Percival Provost. He also experienced his first jet types, the de Havilland Vampire and Gloster Meteor. Benny was introduced to the Canberra at No. 231 Operational Conversion Unit, Bassingbourn, in September 1957, transferring to No. 237 (Photographic Reconnaissance) Operational Conversion Unit at Wyton prior to joining No. 80 (Photographic Reconnaissance) Sqn at Bruggen in Germany in November 1957. After completion of his tour, he was posted to the Air Ministry in London in 1960 and promoted to Squadron Leader in 1961. He retired from the Service in 1964. Benny holds the Bomber Command Clasp, 1939-1945 Star, The Arctic Star, France & Germany Star, Defence Medal, George IV Defence Medal, and the L√©gion d‚Äôhonneur.  Post-RAF career  On leaving the RAF, Benny re-joined the family business. He obtained his British and American civil pilot‚Äôs licenses and flew a Piper Comanche, of which he was part-owner until he was 93 years old. He is an active member of the No. 617 Squadron Association, meeting current service personnel and the public to talk about his RAF experiences and to raise funds for charitable causes, including the RAF Benevolent Fund. He also speaks at the Defence Academy, which enrolls officers from air forces around the world.

History During the Roman period, the site of Davygate lay just inside the city walls, and was covered by barracks. In the 12th- century, the land on which the street now lies was given to John, the King's Larderer. By 1226, it was owned by his son, David, who was living in a house on the land, which became known as Davy Hall. A street gradually developed, which became known as \\"Davygate\\", after the hall. The hall itself became the prison of the Forest of Galtres. By the mid-16th century, the hall was regarded as a liberty, outside the jurisdiction of the city, and it had been divided into tenements, where poor artisans could live, and make and sell goods without paying taxes or adhering to quality standards. It was demolished in 1744, and the site was used partly for a new graveyard for St Helen's, Stonegate, and partly to construct New Street. St Helen's former graveyard, at the north-west end of Davygate, was paved over to create St Helen's Square. The south-eastern end of the street was widened in 1891. It became a major shopping street, and almost all the buildings on its length have since been demolished and replaced. Layout and architecture The street runs south- east from St Helen's Square to St Sampson's Square. Before 1745, it started slightly further north-west, at a junction with Coney Street and Stonegate. On the south-west side, it has a junction with New Street. The south-west side of the street mostly consists of neo-Georgian buildings, the latest dating from the 1950s. Until 2019, part of the range was occupied by a branch of Debenhams. 20 Davygate is a listed building, its earliest sections dating from the 18th-century, but repeatedly rebuilt. On the north-east side, 15 Davygate has a half-timbered facade, originally designed for Liberty's. It was rebuilt as the Tudor Cafe in 1927, with a notable art nouveau interior, but this was destroyed in the 1950s, when it was converted into a bank. Part of the street has been occupied since 1900 by Brown's department store. 3-5 Davygate is described by the City of York Council as \\"one of the best contemporary designs\\" in the city centre, References Category:Streets in York ","title":"Davygate"},{"id":"64820389","text":"Pattiam Gopalan was an Indian politician, belonging to the Communist Party of India (Marxist).

It was recorded in January 2008 at Swiss Radio DRS2 in Z√ºrich, Switzerland, and was released in 2009 by Intakt Records, together with Frith and the ARTE Quartett's second collaborative album, The Big Picture, which was also recorded in January 2008 at Swiss Radio DRS2. Still Urban is a suite of music for electric guitar, saxophone quartet, radio and ambient recordings that was composed by Frith in 2004. Reception In a review of Still Urban at All About Jazz, Marc Medwin stated that while he sometimes found Frith's chamber music \\"not always ... satisfying\\", the inclusion of improvised segments on the album \\"keep[s] textures interesting and paces changing\\". Medwin said the ARTE Quartett's playing is \\"virtuosic\\", and called Frith's compositional techniques \\"fascinating\\", especially when he mixes \\"multi-colored sonority with extended instrumental techniques\\". Michael Rosenstein wrote in a review of the album in Cadence that Frith's composition demonstrates the \\"accomplished flexibility\\" of the ARTE Quartett. He said the use of field recordings and the \\"jagged textures\\" of Frith's guitar never dominates the mix, but provides a platform for the quartet's \\"warm reed sonorities\\". Reviewing the album in Jazzwise, Duncan Heining said that Frith uses the composition to explore the \\"fragmenting urban landscape\\". The music can be \\"harsh\\" at times, but has melodies that feel \\"paradoxically pastoral\\". Heining added that the quartet produces \\"odd textures and colours\\" which evokes a \\"dream-like beauty\\". Julian Cowley wrote in The Wire that the presence of field recordings of city streets in Still Urban \\"create[s] a sense of urbanity that at any moment might be ruptured by discord\\". He said the saxophones tend to sound like an accordion, and while the guitar blends in, it also disrupts the harmony from time to time, creating \\"dramatic encounters\\". But Cowley found that, on the whole, the music did not \\"mov[e] or stimulat[e]\\" him. He stated that \\"saxophone quartets leave me with an uncomfortable sense of the sentimental convenience of family groups\\", and suspected that \\"Frith‚Äôs musical energy now flows through channels that have hardened and narrowed somewhat since the imaginative thrill of his early pathfinding guitar solos and his early adventures in composition.\\" Track listing Source: CD liner notes, Fred Frith discography.

It was released September 6, 2019 by Partridge's label, Ape House. Recording and songwriting process The recordings were first made in 2006 in Partridge's backyard home studio in Swindon, England, which Hitchcock jokingly described in one interview as \\"two old psychedelic pensioners rocking away in a shed in a back garden,\\" but also noted that Partridge's well-known production and technical skills made his back-garden shed \\"the equivalent of the entire firepower of Abbey Road's Studio One.\\" The songs were written together around Partridge's kitchen table, in what Partridge described as a \\"genuine 50/50 collaboration.\\" Both men sang and played guitar; Partridge played bass and drum programming, and did most of the post-production. The recordings were not completed until 2018, when Hitchcock and Partridge got back together to mix them. Both Hitchcock and Partridge remarked in the press that their collaborative songwriting came unexpectedly easily, perhaps because of their similar life experience as vanguards of the 1970s/1980s alternative rock movement and similar set of influences, including Syd Barrett, The Beatles, The Kinks, and Captain Beefheart. (The title of \\"Turn Me On, Deadman\\" references the backwards-masked phrase that can supposedly be heard in the Beatles' \\"Revolution No. 9.\\") Another collaborative album is planned.

As a two-year-old in 2020 he won the Phoenix Stakes as well as finishing second in the Railway Stakes and the Middle Park Stakes. Background Lucky Vega is a bay colt with a white star bred in Ireland by the County Meath-based Kilcarn Stud. As a foal in November 2018 he was consigned to the Goffs Sale where he was bought for ‚Ç¨110,000 by Michael Roy. The colt was returned to the Goffs sales ring in 2019 for the Orby Sale and was sold for ‚Ç¨175,000 to BBA Ireland and YuLong Investments. He entered the ownership of YuLong's founder Zhang Yuesheng and was sent into training with Jessica Harrington at Moone, County Kildare. He was from the seventh crop of foals sired by the Prix du Jockey Club winner Lope de Vega whose other foals have included Phoenix of Spain, Newspaperofrecord, Belardo, Vega Magic (Memsie Stakes) The Right Man (Al Quoz Sprint) and Santa Ana Lane (Stradbroke Handicap). Lucky Vega's dam Queen of Carthage was an unraced daughter of the Prix de l'Op√©ra winner Satwa Queen. Racing career=2020: two-year-old season Lucky Vega made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over six furlongs on good to firm ground at Naas Racecourse on 8 June in which he was ridden by Shane Foley and started the 9/2 second favourite in an eighteen-runner field. After tracking the leaders he showed his inexperience as he hung to the left approaching the final furlong but kept on well to overtake the favoured Lipizzaner in the closing stages to win by half a length. For his next start, the colt was stepped up in class to contest the Group 2 Railway Stakes over the same distance on softer ground at the Curragh on 18 July and started the 3/1 second favourite. He lost his position entering the last quarter mile before staying on in the closing stages to finish second, beaten half a length by the 66/1 outsider Laws of Indices. On 9 August, over the same course and distance, Lucky Vega was partnered by Foley in the Group 1 Phoenix Stakes and started the 4/1 second favourite behind the Aidan O'Brien-trained St Mark's Basilica. The other eight runners included Laws of Indices, Steel Bull (Molecomb Stakes), The Lir Jet (Norfolk Stakes), Ventura Tormenta (Prix Robert Papin) and Aloha Star (Airlie Stud Stakes). Lucky Vega raced just behind the leaders before taking the lead inside the final furlong and drawing away to win \\"easily\\" by three and a half lengths and a short head from Aloha Star and The Lir Jet. The placings of the second and third were reversed after a stewards' enquiry. Jessica Harrington said \\"He probably needed it the last day because he had won his maiden without getting into a battle. The last day, when he got into a bit of a battle, it just hardened him up. He was much more streetwise and, on his work at home, he had really started to come to himself\\". At the Curragh on 13 September Lucky Vega was stepped up in distance for the National Stakes over seven furlongs and started the 2/1 joint-favourite in a ten-runner field. After racing in mid-division he was repeatedly blocked as he attempted to gain a clear run in the straight and came home fifth behind Thunder Moon, Wembley, St Mark's Basilica and Master of the Seas, beaten two and a half lengths by the winner. Two weeks later the colt was sent to England and started 5/2 favourite for the Group 1 Middle Park Stakes. He tracked the leaders before finishing strongly but failed by half a length to overhaul the front-running Supremacy.

It is located in the heart of the town and the home to the entire family, palace staff and officials of the kingdom. It is the place for cultural, political, religious and social importance for the local people. Features The building is made from traditional Sudanese mud-brick architecture. The architectural style is a combination of forms and influences from the Moorish architecture and Sahel-Sudan according to some sources. It is claimed that few historic earthen buildings of this nature remained in the Upper West region because of inadequate skilled artisans that are needed to maintain the building. History Historians claim the people of Wa migrated from Sudan in the northern part of Africa. They were mostly nomadic people and they traveled for miles to feed their livestock. After they settled in their present land, they installed a king and led to the creation of Wa Naa Title with Wa Naa as the supreme leader of the people. It is claimed in the 19th century, the building was built using sundried mud-brick walls and Y-shaped wooden columns to support the flat roofs of a bush-pole framework covered with mud. The place was built to prevent enemy attacks and weapons if they were ever attacked. It is also known to be the gravesite for former kings who are buried in front of the palace. Partnership In 2009, the World Monuments Fund collaborated with the Ghana Museums and Monuments Board to ponder on means on how to preserve the Y-shaped structure. It was regarded as one of the finest and last remains of ancient architectural buildings that have to be preserved. This project was completed in 2012.

The explosion took place in an underground storage tank containing JP-4, a military jet fuel quality. The toll was 34 dead, 2 injured, 3 missing. The explosion was caused by the deliberate activation of a novel carbon dioxide fire extinguishment system during an acceptance test as part of final commissioning. The JP-4 quality is since largely abandoned due to safety concerns because of its low flash point. The accident In 1954 at the US Air Force fuel depot near Bitburg, various acceptance tests were being made on a newly constructed underground fuel storage tank. The tank was fitted with a novel carbon dioxide fire extinguishing system, the first of its kind in Germany. The US Army was not responsible for design, construction and operation of storage facilities at the time, but the fuel involved was the property of the United States. The senior engineering staff of the French La mission des grands travaux a√©ronautiques en Allemagne and other French and German officials, technicians and contractors were present at the site and attending an acceptance test. The diameter of the underground tank was about 96 feet (29 m) with a total capacity of 1,386,000 US gal (5,250 m3). The tank was about 20 % full at the time of the accident. The roof of the underground tank was capped with iron reinforced concrete and covered with a layer of soil. The CO2 cylinders were located in a half-buried concrete structure about 250 feet (75 m) from the storage site. 120 gas cylinders, each with a liquid gas capacity of 30 kg, were connected together in a three battery arrangement. A buried steel pipeline connected the battery with the storage tank. Most if not all of the victims were standing on the top of the tank during a controlled activation of the thermal sensing devices that would trigger CO2 cylinders to discharge gas into the tank's headspace. At about 16:00 hours, one minute after the CO2 discharge commenced, a massive explosion disintegrated the tank. Although the ability of liquefied CO2 to create static electricity upon depressurization was reported as early as in 1925, it was unknown to the tank designers and not identified in the official investigation of the accident by the US Army. It was only identified later in a report by German scientists. Relevance The accident has relevance today as it demonstrates the dangers of static electricity when injecting carbon dioxide into an ignitable atmosphere. As such, it is a case example of de-learning. Knowledge on hazards learned the hard way through accidents can be forgotten. This has happened in the fast-growing wood pellet industry where trouble with smoldering fires in storage silos has led to new techniques for firefighting which employ injection of inert gases such as carbon dioxide. Although the electrostatic hazard has been known for more than 50 years, many standards, guidelines, recent editions of frequently cited pellet handbooks and other literature cover the hazard superficially or do not mention it at all. The hazard is insufficiently covered in NFPA 12 and it may constitute a hazard for seagoing general cargo vessels where fire protection for cargo holds employs pressurized storage of liquefied carbon dioxide.Hedlund, F. H., & Jarleivson Hilduberg, √ò. (2018). Dangers of releasing CO‚ÇÇ to fight fires in the cargo hold of seagoing bulk carriers .
