Jones, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 679 (1871), is a United States Supreme Court case. The case was based upon a dispute regarding the Third or Walnut Street Presbyterian Church in Louisville, Kentucky.. The Court held that in adjudications of church property disputes, 1) courts cannot rule on the truth or falsity of a religious teaching, 2) where a previous authority structure existed before the dispute, courts should defer to the decision of that structure, and 3) in the absence of such an internal authority structure, courts should defer to the wishes of a majority of the congregation. Because the Walnut Street Presbyterian Church had a clear internal authority structure, the court granted control of the property to that group, even though it was only supported by a minority of the congregation. The first such case was Watson v. Jones, which was decided on common–law grounds in a diversity action without explicit reliance on the First Amendment. A constitutionalization of the rule was made in Kedroff v. St. Nicholas Cathedral, in which the Court held unconstitutional a state statute that recognized the autonomy and authority of those North American branches of the Russian Orthodox Church which had declared their independence from the general church. Recognizing that Watson v. Jones had been decided on nonconstitutional grounds, the Court thought nonetheless that the opinion “radiates . . . a spirit of freedom for religious organizations, and independence from secular control or manipulation—in short, power to decide for themselves, free from state interference, matters of church government as well as those of faith and doctrine.” The power of civil courts to resolve church property disputes was severely circumscribed, the Court held, because to permit resolution of doctrinal disputes in court was to jeopardize First Amendment values. What a court must do, it was held, is to look at the church rules: if the church is a hierarchical one which reposes determination of ecclesiastical issues in a certain body, the resolution by that body is determinative, while if the church is a congregational one prescribing action by a majority vote, that determination will prevail. On the other hand, a court confronted with a church property dispute could apply “neutral principles of law, developed for use in all property disputes,” when to do so would not require resolution of doctrinal issues. In a later case the Court elaborated on the limits of proper inquiry, holding that an argument over a matter of internal church government, the power to reorganize the dioceses of a hierarchical church in this country, was “at the core of ecclesiastical affairs” and a court could not interpret the church constitution to make an independent determination of the power but must defer to the interpretation of the body authorized to decide.

It was the only Bunkhouse Stampede event to air as a pay-per-view (PPV) event. The event took place on January 24, 1988 from the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York. In the main event, Dusty Rhodes won a Steel Cage Bunkhouse Stampede. On the undercard Ric Flair successfully defended the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Road Warrior Hawk, Nikita Koloff successfully defended the NWA World Television Championship against Bobby Eaton and Barry Windham lost the short- lived NWA Western States Heritage Championship to Larry Zbyzsko. Storylines The event comprised four professional wrestling matches that involved wrestlers from pre-existing rivalries, plots and storylines that were played out on Worldwide, Pro and World Championship Wrestling-Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP)'s television programs. Wrestlers portrayed a hero, villain or a tweener as they followed a series of events that built tension, and culminated in a wrestling match or a series of matches. The main match heading into the event was the Steel Cage Bunkhouse Stampede. By December 26, Big Bubba Rogers, Arn Anderson, Tully Blanchard, The Barbarian and The Warlord, Lex Luger, Road Warrior Animal, Steve Williams, Mighty Wilbur and Ivan Koloff had qualified for the Bunkhouse Stampede final. The final participant was determined by a Wildcard Bunkhouse Stampede on January 1, which was won by Dusty Rhodes. Mighty Wilbur was injured and therefore was unable to compete in the final. No explanation was ever given as to why Steve Williams and Big Bubba Rogers did not compete in the final. Another rivalry heading into the event was between Ric Flair and Road Warrior Hawk for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. At Starrcade, Flair defeated Ron Garvin to win the title. On December 6, The Road Warriors (Hawk and Animal) defeated Flair and Arn Anderson by disqualification. On January 24 episode of World Championship Wrestling, Flair was scheduled to defend the title against Hawk at Bunkhouse Stampede. On January 3 episode of World Championship Wrestling, Jim Cornette, the manager of the NWA United States Tag Team Champions Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane) predicted that Eaton would be the next NWA United States Heavyweight Champion and Lane the next NWA World Television Champion, resulting in a rivalry between Midnight Express and the US Champion Dusty Rhodes and the Television Champion Nikita Koloff. Rhodes and Koloff competed against Midnight Express in several Steel Cage matches at live events. This resulted in a Television Championship match between Koloff and Eaton at Bunkhouse Stampede. Event Before the event aired live on PPV, Sting and Jimmy Garvin defeated The Sheepherders (Butch Miller and Luke Williams) by disqualification in a non-televised tag team match. In prior weeks of TV it was mentioned that The Rock and Roll Express would face The Sheepherders at this event, but no explanation was ever given as to why this did not occur, although behind the scenes, both Morton and Gibson had left the promotion the day before. Preliminary matches When the live broadcast commenced, Nikita Koloff defended the NWA World Television Championship against Bobby Eaton in the opening match. Koloff started focusing on Eaton's arm but Eaton gained the control of the match. The action continued back and forth with both men exchanging moves. Eaton eventually regained momentum and performed a Diving Elbow Drop and a Hammerlock. Koloff finally got out of the Hammerlock but Eaton attacked Koloff again and performed a Missile Dropkick. Eaton applied another Hammerlock and Koloff got out of the move and tried to hit a Lariat, which he called Russian Sickle. However, Eaton caught Koloff's arm and applied a third Hammerlock. The action continued until Koloff performed a Russian Sickle and the twenty-minute time limit of the match expired. As a result, Koloff retained the title. In the next match, Barry Windham defended the NWA Western States Heritage Championship against Larry Zbyzsko. Windham controlled the earlier part of the match until Zbyzsko began focusing on Windham's injured knee and continued to attack it. Windham eventually made a comeback by performing a Powerslam. He tried to perform a Diving Elbow Drop but Zbyszko continued to attack his knee. Windham countered with a Dropkick and tried to perform a Backdrop Suplex but he suffered some pain in his knee that allowed Zbyszko to get a near-fall. Windham eventually gained control of the match by performing a Gutwrench Suplex and applied a Sleeper Hold. Zbyszko held the ropes to be released and rolled out, causing Windham to follow him. Zbyszko shoved him into the ringpost. Windham tried to perform a Lariat but Zbyszko collapsed and Windham fell to the floor. Zbyszko took advantage and smashed Windham's face on a ringside table. The action returned to the ring where Windham tried to perform a Sunset Flip but Zbyszko countered it with a near-fall. Zbyszko tried to perform a Swinging Neckbreaker but Windham countered it into a Backslide. Zbyszko tried to perform a Piledriver but Windham countered with a Back Body Drop, allowing both men to get knocked out. Zbyszko missed a charge on Windham into the corner, allowing Windham to hit ten punches in the corner. The referee was attacked by Zbyszko and Windham tried to pin him with a roll-up. Zbyzsko's valet Baby Doll gave him her shoe and Zbyzsko hit him with the shoe to win the championship. In the final match on the undercard Ric Flair defended the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Road Warrior Hawk. Hawk dominated Flair with his power moves, while Flair's moves seemed to have no effect on Hawk until Flair hit Hawk with a Low Blow, raked his eyes and delivered a Knee Drop. Flair started getting control of the match until Hawk performed a Shoulder Neckbreaker. After Hawk missed a Jumping Fist Drop, Flair applied a Figure Four Leglock. Flair eventually broke the hold and tried to climb the top rope but Hawk tossed him down. Hawk performed a Clothesline on both Flair and the referee. Flair was clotheslined outside the ring and also pulled Hawk outside the ring, where Hawk hit him with a powerslam. Hawk performed a Superplex and tried to pin him but Flair's manager James J. Dillon broke the attempt with a chair. Hawk's manager Paul Ellering woke up the referee as Flair nailed Hawk with a chair, for which he was disqualified. However, Flair retained the title. Main event match The main event was a Steel Cage Bunkhouse Stampede. The objective of the match was to throw the opponent out of the cage door or send him out via the top of the cage for the elimination. The participants were Tully Blanchard, Arn Anderson, The Barbarian, The Warlord, Dusty Rhodes, Ivan Koloff, Lex Luger and Road Warrior Animal. Animal eliminated first Koloff over the top of the cage, and then Warlord through the cage door, but was himself eliminated by The Barbarian after a Big Boot. Blanchard and Anderson double-teamed Luger and tried to eliminate him through the cage door but all three men were eliminated at the same time. Rhodes and Barbarian were the remaining participants and continued to fight each other. Barbarian hit Rhodes with a Diving Headbutt but was unable to eliminate him. Both men climbed the over the top of the cage, where Rhodes hit Barbarian with two Bionic Elbows win the Bunkhouse Stampede for the fourth consecutive time. Aftermath The Bunkhouse Stampede event met little success and was badly criticized. Especially, its booking was not appreciated due to Dusty Rhodes winning every Bunkhouse Stampede Battle Royal. Along with Rhodes' booking, the event was marred by the tickets having the wrong start time on them (a 6:30 start time was incorrectly advertised as 7:30, causing a majority of the fans to miss the first half of the event). The event gave birth to a new rivalry between Lex Luger and the Four Horsemen, a group Luger left in late 1987 after losing the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship. On Clash of the Champions I, Luger and Barry Windham defeated Horsemen members, the NWA World Tag Team Champions Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard to win the title. On April 23 edition of World Championship Wrestling, Luger and Windham lost the title back to Anderson and Blanchard when Windham betrayed Luger and joined Horsemen. Luger became the #1 contender for Horsemen's leader Ric Flair's NWA World Heavyweight Championship, unsuccessfully challenging him for the title at The Great American Bash and Starrcade.

The rifle was introduced in 1957 by Weatherby and was designed to safely contain the high pressures associated with the Weatherby line of high performance cartridges. It is the flagship rifle of the Weatherby line of firearms. The Weatherby Mark V rifles are considered prestigious or luxury firearms by many. This is due in part to Roy Weatherby who presented the rifles to royalty, politicians, gun writers and actors including Prince Abdorreza Pahlavi of Iran, Generals James Doolittle (USAF) and Chuck Yeager (USAF), Jack O'Connor, Warren Page, Elgin Gates and Lorne Greene and was able to use this fact as a marketing tool. Early development Ever since Roy Weatherby began manufacturing rifles he had to rely on a third party to provide the actions for his rifles. Beginning in 1949 Weatherby began building his rifles around the FN Belgian Mauser action. In 1955 Schultz & Larson actions were added to the mix while adding the Mathieu left handed action to his rifle action line up. With the addition of the large capacity .378 Weatherby Magnum a new action type was warranted so the Brevex Magnum Mauser action was added. A little later the FN Sako Mauser actions were added to action types used by Weatherby to build his rifles. Roy Weatherby had been disappointed by the length of time that was taken discussing and negotiating before coming to an agreement with his European manufacturing partners. With five European companies supplying actions, the frequent trips made to Europe left him little time to run the day-to-day business operations in South Gate, California. Roy Weatherby had found the Mauser-type wanting due to the case head not being completely enclosed and supported within the breech. While these action types could easily withstand a high pressure of about 70,000 C.U.P, he felt that one which would have the capability of handling 200,000 C.U.P. would fare better with the Weatherby line of cartridges. He had been aware that many handloaders were overloading their cartridges seeking higher performance, which was resulting in blown primers and ruptured case heads. This in turn would lead to hot gases making their way through the bolt and into the shooter's face and eyes and causing injuries to his customers. Weatherby's requirements included a bolt face which was countersunk into the bolt which would enclose the cartridge's case head while the bolt head was enclosed in a counterbored barrel breach, which in turn would prevent the case head from rupturing. If a rupture should occur, the bolt would have holes through which hot gases could be vented safely towards the side and away from the shooter's face. Further as an extra safety measure he required an enclosed or shrouded bolt sleeve that would prevent the hot gases from making their way through the bolt mechanism to the shooter's face. To Weatherby, the safety and strength of the design were paramount. The Weatherby Mark V action uses an interrupted screw breech as used on many artillery pieces. The nine lugs are actually sections of a screw thread. The bolt cams forward slightly as the bolt is closed following the pitch angle of the screw thread. Weatherby designed the action type with nine locking lugs arranged in three rows. It was determined early on that these lugs would not protrude outside the bolt but would be of the same diameter as the bolt body itself. Such a design would be conducive to a smooth fluid movement of the bolt through its feeding and extraction cycles. In spring 1955 Weatherby demonstrated his new action at the annual NRA meetings in Washington, D.C. The action type was shown to Burt Munhall of H.P. White Ballistics Laboratory and to General Julian Hatcher to elicit their opinion of the design. Both were impressed with the design and encouraged Weatherby to commercialize the action as soon as possible. At this time Weatherby had been looking for someone to provide the technical design, drawings and specifications for the design of his new action. General Hatcher suggested that John Garand (of the M-1 Garand rifle fame) would be suitable for the job. However, when contacted Garand expressed disinterest in the project as he was enjoying his retirement. Walter Howe, the editor of the American Rifleman magazine suggested the Mathewson Tool Company of New Haven which had worked with Winchester, Remington, and the U.S. government designing and building prototypes. While Dave Mathewson managed to build and deliver the design details, the prototype did not include all the features which Weatherby had required, while taking longer than anticipated to provide the prototype design. It was not until 1957 that the first prototype rifle was built. This was the fifth design model of the rifle as four previous designs had been abandoned. The rifle was shown to Elgin Gates who suggested that the rifle be named the Mark V. This fifth prototype was designed and built with the assistance of Fred Jennie, an engineer hired by Roy Weatherby. It was more streamlined and had a more simplified trigger and safety which would lead to lower manufacturing and tooling costs. In 1956 Weatherby visited Europe in an attempt to find a supplier for the Mark V action. Steyr-Daimler-Puch, which had been manufacturing the Mannlicher rifle, was eager to work with Weatherby, but the high cost of the initial tooling charges of $200,000 was found to have been too excessive. Schultz & Larsen, which had been building the .378 Weatherby Magnum, was also contacted, but due to an anticipated rise in labor costs Weatherby had to keep looking elsewhere. When Sako of Finland, which was working on the FN Mauser action for Weatherby rifles was approached, it indicated that it had a backlog of production yet to complete and that such a project would have to wait for a year and a half. Also, labor costs in Finland had been rising, which would increase the price per unit cutting into profits. The Birmingham Small Arms Company Limited (BSA) of Birmingham was extremely receptive to the idea of building the action and even attempted to absorb the initial tooling costs. However, it was unable to manufacture the action with the nine locking lugs. While several companies bid on the contract, Weatherby settled on Precision Foundry Inc. (PFI) of Leandro, California in 1957. It was decided that all major parts would use the investment casting process. Another firm, Gardner Machine Co. of Hollywood, California, would finish all these parts to their final dimensions and Picco Industries of Sierra Madre, California would manufacture the magazine floorplate catch, the trigger sear, and the thumb safety. All the parts thus manufactured would be delivered to Weatherby's South Gate facility where the final polishing, bluing, and assembly would take place. The barrel and stocks were made in-house by Weatherby at the company's South Gate facility. Due to the investment casting process and issues with porosity of metal, PFI manufactured actions did not easily accept the high-luster bluing process which was a trademark of Weatherby rifles, which resulted in high rejection rates of over 50%. Furthermore, the delivery of component parts by PFI had been irregular, which led to a backlog of orders. In 1957 Weatherby went back to Europe to visit J.P. Sauer & Sohn, which was at the time primarily a shotgun manufacturer. Udo van Meeteren wanted not only to manufacture the action but also the complete rifle as well. Within two months of the visit a contract with J.P. Sauer & Sohn was signed. In 1958 Fred Jennie visited the Sauer plant in Eckernförde, Germany to help with the setup process. At this time it was decided that receiver and bolt would be made from forgings instead of the investment casting process as Sauer was more familiar with the process. Rifle barrels would be hammer-forged by Sauer, which promoted greater uniformity from breech to muzzle and which in turn led to greater accuracy and longer barrel life. By employing this method of hammer-forging barrels, Weatherby became the first U.S. company to offer hammer-forged barrels in the United States. In 1970 Weatherby moved production to the Howa factory in Japan. The move was a result of increased costs of production in Europe; Howa was able to make the rifles and at a greater cost savings. The strength of the actions was never compromised—to many, fit and finish are superior to German models and compete well with U.S. models. Howa manufactured Mark Vs until production was brought to the United States in 1994. Proof testing of the Mark V action Weatherby had intended that the new action would be the safest and strongest bolt action available. The rifle was marketed as \\"The World's Strongest Bolt Action\\". The Mark V action has been tested to be able to contain up to 200,000 CUP (Copper Units of Pressure). The testing of the rifle was conducted on a production rifle chambered for the .300 Weatherby Magnum. Before testing was to be conducted, very thorough measurements of the rifle were taken so as to provide a benchmark for the testing which was to be undertaken. The first test was conducted using a bullet propelled by of Du Pont #4350 powder. This load provided of pressure. This load did not show any pressure or extraction issues with the new Mark V action but caused a slight sticking of the cartridge case in the Mauser style rifle design. Subsequent testing was performed using the same bullet and using a powder charge of Du Pont #4350 which increased by increments of for each test thereafter. The second testing which was conducted with the showed no signs of pressure nor issues with extraction even though the measured pressure was close to . Firing this load in the Mauser rifle led to a blown primer and extreme difficulty was experienced in extracting the spent case. Using of Du Pont #4350 the cartridge began to show signs of pressure in the Mark V action. However, the case did not stick and extraction was performed easily. Breech pressure was found to be between . Measurements of the spent case showed that the case had stretched at the belt a mere . The spent case from the test led to a slightly sticking case, which in turn led to a slight difficulty in opening of the bolt. Measurements from the case belt showed that the belt had expanded from to . The pressure generated by this load was . The fifth test was conducted used a load of of Du Pont 4350. Firing this load led to some difficulty in opening the bolt, and the case was extracted when opened. The belt of the case still measured . A difference in the diameter between the bolt head and the diameter of the barrel of per side was noted. No bulging of the bolt, receiver or the barrel was noted. Headspace was measured to be the same as prior to the testing. Further testing was conducted with a bullet lodged into the throat of the barrel. A cartridge loaded with the standard charge of of Du Pont 4350 and a bullet was fired into the back of the first bullet. It was found that both bullets exited the barrel. The primer had been pierced and the exiting gas entered into the bolt and hit the firing pin sleeve, which was loosened slightly. The bolt was opened by hand but the cartridge stayed stuck in the chamber. When the case was tapped out, it was found to be in good condition except for its pierced primer. It was found that the barrel, just in front of the receiver ring, had expanded from to . The diameter of the bolt head had expanded from to . The head space had increased from to . All other dimensions had stayed constant. This test was conducted 15 times. A test was conducted with a bullet lodged into the bore of the rifle and a grain bullet was fired into the back of this bullet. The result of this test found that the cartridge case head had expanded to . After these additional 15 tests it was found that the head space was set back only a mere .  Action variants  The Weatherby Mark V action has remained virtually unchanged from the original design of Fred Jennie and Roy Weatherby which is a testament to the longevity of the design. Nevertheless, some refinement to the design has occurred over time. The Mark V action is a front locking, push feed, bolt action repeater. The lug arrangement allows for 54° bolt lift. This shorter bolt lift allows for increased clearance between the bolt handle and any accessories such as scopes that may be mounted on the rifle and arguably provides for faster cycling of the action. This compares favorably with the Mauser style rifles which have a 90° bolt lift. The bolt body, including the handle is made of a single piece of machined steel. To remove any play and reduce any chance of the bolt binding during the cycling of the action, the bolt head is smaller with the locking lugs being the same diameter as the body itself. The bolt has three gas vents along the bolt body which will allow for the venting of hot gases should the case not seal the chamber or if a pierced primer should occur. Shortly after production began in Germany, the bolt body was fluted to provide further positive feeding and extraction of the cartridges. 9 Lug/Magnum The 9 Lug/Magnum action was the original design which went into production and was also the design which was subject to the strength testing conducted by Weatherby. The original 9 Lug design lacked the bolt fluting and featured a safety mounted on the receiver. These rifles were made by PFI and J.P. Sauer & Sohn in the early 1960s. The refinements to the original design included a fluted bolt and a redesigned safety allowing for smoother feeding and extraction and a safer design. The 9 Lug action is considered the archetypal Mark V action. The 9 Lug design features a bolt head with nine locking lugs arranged in three rows with each row having three locking lugs. The Magnum Mark V bolt is the heaviest bolt available in a commercially produced rifle. The 9 Lug Mark V action is currently available in rifles chambered for Weatherby calibers. However, late production Sauer and very early Howa manufactured Mark V rifles in .30-06 Springfield and .270 Winchester were chambered in the 9 Lug Mark V actions. As the production run of these rifles was short such rifles are a rarity and considered collectibles.  Varmintmaster  In 1963 Weatherby introduced a scaled down version of the 9 Lug design which was made specifically for chambering smaller varmint cartridges. The Varmintmaster was introduced together with the .224 Weatherby Magnum cartridge. The Varmintmaster was also chambered in the .22-250 Remington. This action featured six lugs arranged in two rows. The 9 Lug design was found to be too large and too long for use with varmint cartridges and this new action addressed this issue. The action features a shorter one piece bolt of a smaller diameter than the 6 Lug/Standard design. The Varmintmaster action was later used in the Weatherby Mark V Silhouette handgun as well. 6 Lug/Standard The 6 Lug design has been only available in non- Weatherby cartridges and was offered beginning with the .30-06 Springfield and the .270 Winchester cartridges. Like the Varmintmaster (which predates the 6 Lug/Standard action design) it features six locking lugs arranged in two rows. The bolt is shorter and is considerably lighter than the 9 Lug/Magnum design. Coupled with a narrower receiver, the Standard Mark V action is better suited to most cartridges. This action type is also used by the Weatherby CFP (Center-fire Pistol) as it provided a greater flexibility as to which cartridges could be chambered. The Standard Mark V action was also used in the Super Varmintmaster rifle rather than the original Varmintmaster action due to cost and production constraints. The Standard Mark V action is only available in rifles chambered for non-Weatherby cartridges.  References  External links  * The Weatherby Mark V Rifle - Official site * Weatherby Inc.

It first appeared in the periodical Le Siècle in August 1839, and appeared in volume form the same year. Balzac based the characters in this novel on real figures: Félicité des Touches, a celebrated musician and writer, is based on George Sand. Béatrix de Rochefide is based on Marie d'Agoult (who wrote under the pen name of Daniel Stern); Gennaro Conti is based on Franz Liszt; Claude Vignon is based on Gustave Planche.Samuel R. Crocker, Edward Abbott, Nicholas Paine Gilman, Madeline Vaughan Abbott Bushnell (\\"Mrs. C. E. Bushnell, \\"), Bliss Carman, Herbert Copeland, The literary world (S.R. Crocker, 1897), 177. Plot A handsome young man named Calyste du Guénic is in love with the older woman, Félicité des Touches, a famous writer who uses the pen name of Camille Maupin. Félicité at first does not reciprocate Calyste’s feelings, and Calyste falls in love with the blonde marchioness Béatrix de Rochefide.Carol de Dobay Rifelj, Coiffures: hair in nineteenth- century French literature and culture (University of Delaware Press, 2010), 143-4. Béatrix is a beautiful but selfish woman; one critic remarked in 1897 in regards to Béatrix that “for cold-blooded cruelty and vulgarity she is unexampled, and her efforts to keep her youth and her hold over men are drawn in Balzac’s heaviest and most pitiless manner.” Béatrix had already had an affair with Gennaro Conti, and Calyste has an additional rival in the form of Claude Vignon. Félicité des Touches (Camille Maupin) tries to help Calyste win Béatrix’s heart, thus sacrificing her own. Calyste’s efforts are ultimately a failure, and Béatrix is taken away by Gennaro Conti. Calyste is devastated by his failure, but promises his dying father to get married. Félicité des Touches enters a convent, but before she does, she uses her fortune to arrange a marriage for Calyste with a woman named Sabine de Grandlieu. When Calyste encounters Béatrix again in Paris, his wife Sabine struggles to win back her husband’s affections after Calyste falls for Béatrix again. Subsequently, through the intercession of Count Maxime de Trailles, Béatrix falls for another young man, and Calyste comes to his senses.

Life and career  Bernard was born in Spanish Town, Jamaica. He was educated in Bath, England, and practiced law in Jamaica until the death of his father in 1850. He came to Canada and settled in Barrie, Upper Canada, where he became part of local society. In 1854, he brought his mother and sister Agnes to live with him. About that time, he joined the local militia and eventually gained the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Bernard was a Freemason of Ionic Lodge, No. 25 (Ontario) of Toronto, resigning when he left to work in Quebec in 1859. Bernard was a successful lawyer and co-editor of the Upper Canada Law Journal when he became the private secretary of Attorney General John A. Macdonald in 1857. He soon became chief clerk, and he was the recording secretary at the Charlottetown Conference in 1864. In February 1867, Bernard's sister Agnes married John A. Macdonald, who became the Prime Minister of Canada a few months later. Bernard was a very good friend of Macdonald before he became Macdonald's brother-in-law. After Confederation, Bernard served as the private secretary to the Prime Minister between 1867 and 1873. He was also the Deputy Minister of Justice from 1868 to 1876. Bernard was succeeded in that position by Zebulon Aiton Lash. Some historians, such as P. B. Waite, consider Bernard to be a Father of Confederation. In 1872, he was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George.

History  The College, Aba Dina police College, opened in 1946, staffed by Swedish instructors, although since 1960 the faculty has consisted entirely of Ethiopians who were police college graduates. Candidates for the two-year course had to have a secondary school education or its equivalent. The two year program was phased out later and replaced by a three years training by taking candidates who were High school graduates with 'C' average in ESLC (college ready) or college dropouts and incorporating college academic courses taught by lecturers and professors from the then HSI University. Officers usually were commissioned after completion of a cadet course and a selected few going to universities and colleges to further their education and graduate with degrees in Health, Law engineering. Israel, The US police academy and other countries were represented as advisors at different point and many of the graduates were also awarded scholarship to study abroad. After the Derg took power, the government increased enrollment to bring new blood into the national police; from 1974 to 1979, about 800 graduates received commissions as second lieutenants.\\"Public Order and Internal Security: The National Police\\", Library of Congress Country Studies: Ethiopia (Data from 1991; accessed 26 April 2011) Instruction at the college includes general courses in police science, criminal law, tactics, traffic control, sociology, criminology, physical education, and first aid. Practical training was offered midway in the program and sometimes entailed field service in troubled areas. Those cadets who had passed their final examinations with distinction were selected for further specialized training. The police college also offers short-term courses and refresher training for service officers. By the end of 1990, the police college had graduated a total of 3,951 officer cadets in the years since its establishment in 1946.

The massive influx of personal information that has become available online and stored in the cloud has put user privacy at the forefront of discussion regarding the database's ability to safely store such personal information. The extent to which users and social media platform administrators can access user profiles has become a new topic of ethical consideration, and the legality, awareness, and boundaries of subsequent privacy violations are critical concerns in advance of the technological age. A social network is a social structure made up of a set of social actors (such as individuals or organizations), sets of dyadic ties, and other social interactions between actors. Privacy concerns with social networking services is a subset of data privacy, involving the right of mandating personal privacy concerning storing, re-purposing, provision to third parties, and displaying of information pertaining to oneself via the Internet. Social network security and privacy issues result from the large amounts of information these sites process each day. Features that invite users to participate in—messages, invitations, photos, open platform applications and other applications are often the venues for others to gain access to a user's private information. In addition, the technologies needed to deal with user's information may intrude their privacy. The advent of the Web 2.0 has caused social profiling and is a growing concern for internet privacy. Web 2.0 is the system that facilitates participatory information sharing and collaboration on the Internet, in social networking media websites like Facebook and MySpace.

History Before social networking sites exploded over the past decade, there were earlier forms of social networking that dated back to 1997 such as Six Degrees and Friendster. While these two social media platforms were introduced, additional forms of social networking included: online multiplayer games, blog and forum sites, newsgroups, mailings lists and dating services. They created a backbone for the new modern sites. Since the start of these sites, privacy has become a concern for the public. In 1996, a young woman in New York City was on a first date with an online acquaintance and later sued for sexual harassment, after her date tried to play out some of the sexual fantasies they had discussed while online. This is just an early example of many more issues to come regarding internet privacy.Tracy Mitrano. (November–December 2006). A Wider World: Youth, Privacy, and Social Networking Technologies. Retrieved from http://www.educause.edu/EDUCAUSE+Review/EDUCAUSEReviewMagazineVolume41/AWiderWorldYouthPrivacyandSoci/158095 In the past, social networking sites primarily consisted of the capability to chat with others in a chat room, which was far less popular than social networks today. People using these sites were seen as \\"techies\\" unlike users in the current era. One of the early privacy cases was in regards to MySpace, due to \\"stalking of minors, bullying, and privacy issues\\", which inevitably led to the adoption of \\"age requirements and other safety measures\\". It is very common in society now for events such as stalking and \\"catfishing\\" to occur. According to Kelly Quinn, “the use of social media has become ubiquitous, with 73% of all U.S. adults using social network sites today and significantly higher levels of use among young adults and females.\\" Social media sites have grown in popularity over the past decade, and they only continue to grow. A majority of the United States population uses some sort of social media site. Causes There are several causes that contribute to the invasion of privacy throughout social networking platforms. It has been recognized that “by design, social media technologies contest mechanisms for control and access to personal information, as the sharing of user-generated content is central to their function.\\" This proves that social networking companies need private information to become public so their sites can operate. They require people to share and connect with each other. This may not necessarily be a bad thing; however, one must be aware of the privacy concerns. Even with privacy settings, posts on the internet can still be shared with people beyond a user's followers or friends. One reason for this is that “English law is currently incapable of protecting those who share on social media from having their information disseminated further than they intend.\\" Information always has the chance to be unintentionally spread online. Once something is posted on the internet, it becomes public and is no longer private. Users can turn privacy settings on for their accounts; however, that does not guarantee that information will not go beyond their intended audience. Pictures and posts can be saved and posts may never really get deleted. In 2013, the Pew Research Center found that \\"60% of teenage Facebook users have private profiles.” This proves that privacy is definitely something that people still wish to obtain. A person's life becomes much more public because of social networking. Social media sites have allowed people to connect with many more people than with just in person interactions. People can connect with users from all across the world that they may never have the chance to meet in person. This can have positive effects; however, this also raises many concerns about privacy. Information can be posted about a person that they do not want getting out. In the novel It’s Complicated, the author explains that some people “believe that a willingness to share in public spaces—and, most certainly, any act of exhibitionism and publicity—is incompatible with a desire for personal privacy.\\" Once something is posted on the internet, it becomes accessible to multiple people and can even be shared beyond just assumed friends or followers. Many employers now look at a person's social media before hiring them for a job or position. Social media has become a tool that people use to find out information about a person's life. Someone can learn a lot about a person based on what they post before they even meet them once in person. The ability to achieve privacy is a never ending process. Boyd describes that “achieving privacy requires the ability to control the social situation by navigating complex contextual cues, technical affordances , and social dynamics.\\" Society is constantly changing; therefore, the ability to understand social situations to obtain privacy regularly has to be changed. Various levels of privacy offered Social networking sites vary in the levels of privacy offered. For some social networking sites like Facebook, providing real names and other personal information is encouraged by the site (onto a page known as a 'Profile'). This information usually consists of the birth date, current address, and telephone number(s). Some sites also allow users to provide more information about themselves such as interests, hobbies, favorite books or films, and even relationship status. However, there are other social network sites, such as Match.com, where most people prefer to be anonymous. Thus, linking users to their real identity can sometimes be rather difficult. Nevertheless, individuals can sometimes be identified with face re-identification. Studies have been done on two major social networking sites, and it is found that by overlapping 15% of the similar photographs, profile pictures with similar pictures over multiple sites can be matched to identify the users.Gross, R. and Acquisti, A. 2005. Information Revelation and Privacy in Online Social Networking Sites (The Facebook Case).[online]. p. 2. Available at: http://www.heinz.cmu.edu/~acquisti/papers/privacy-facebook- gross-acquisti.pdf [Accessed 24 April 2011]. People concern “According to research conducted by the Boston Consulting Group, privacy of personal data is a top issue for 76 percent of global consumers and 83 percent of U.S. consumers.” Six-in-ten Americans (61%) have said they would like to do more to protect their privacy. For sites that do encourage information disclosure, it has been noted that a majority of the users have no trouble disclosing their personal information to a large group of people. In 2005, a study was performed to analyze data of 540 Facebook profiles of students enrolled at Carnegie Mellon University. It was revealed that 89% of the users gave genuine names, and 61% gave a photograph of themselves for easier identification. Majority of users also had not altered their privacy setting, allowing a large number of unknown users to have access to their personal information (the default setting originally allowed friends, friends of friends, and non- friends of the same network to have the full view of a user's profile). It is possible for users to block other users from locating them on Facebook, but this must be done by individual basis, and would, therefore, appear not to be commonly used for a wide number of people. Most users do not realize that while they may make use of the security features on Facebook the default setting is restored after each update. All of this has led to many concerns that users are displaying far too much information on social networking sites which may have serious implications on their privacy. Facebook was criticized due to the perceived laxity regarding privacy in the default setting for users.Kelly, S. Identity 'at risk' on Facebook. BBC News. [online]. Available at: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/click_online/7375772.stm [Accessed 25 April 2011]. The “Privacy Paradox” is a phenomenon that occurs when individuals, who state that they have concerns about their privacy online, take no action to secure their accounts. Furthermore, while individuals may take extra security steps for other online accounts, such as those related to banking or finance, this does not extend to social media accounts. Some of these basic or simple security steps would include deleting cookies, browser history, or checking one's computer for spyware. Some may attribute this lack of action to “third-person bias”. This occurs when people are aware of risks, but then do not believe that these risks apply or relate to them as individuals. Another explanation is a simple risk reward analysis. Individuals may be willing to risk their privacy to reap the rewards of being active on social media. Oftentimes, the risk of being exploited for the private information shared on the internet is overshadowed by the rewards of exclusively sharing personal information that bolsters the appeal of the social media user. In the study by Van der Velden and El Emam, teenagers are described as “active users of social media, who seem to care about privacy, but who also reveal a considerable amount of personal information.” This brings up the issue of what should be managed privately on social media, and is an example of the Privacy Paradox. This study in particular looked at teenagers with mental illness and how they interact on social media. Researchers found that “it is a place where teenage patients stay up-to-date about their social life—it is not seen as a place to discuss their diagnosis and treatment.” Therefore, social media is a forum that needs self-protection and privacy. Privacy should be a main concern, especially for teens who may not be entirely informed about the importance and consequences of public versus private use. For example, the “discrepancy between stated privacy concerns and the disclosure of private information.” =User awareness in social networking sites= Users are often the targets as well as the source of information in social networking. Users leave digital imprints during browsing of social networking sites or services. It has been identified from few of the online studies, that users trust websites and social networking sites. As per trust referred, \\"trust is defined in (Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman, 1995) as \\"the willingness of a party to be vulnerable to the actions of another party based on the expectation that the other will perform a particular action important to the trustor, irrespective of the ability to monitor or control that other party\\" (p. 712)\\". A survey was conducted by Carnegie Mellon University, a majority of users provided their living city, phone numbers among other personal information, while user is clearly unaware of consequences of sharing certain information. Adding to this insight, is the social networking users are from various cities, remote villages, towns, cultures, traditions, religions, background, economic classes, education background, time zones and so on that highlight the significant gap in awareness. The survey results of the paper suggest, \\"These results show that the interaction of trust and privacy concern in social networking sites is not yet understood to a sufficient degree to allow accurate modeling of behavior and activity. The results of the study encourage further research in the effort to understand the development of relationships in the online social environment and the reasons for differences in behavior on different sites.\\" As per reference, a survey conducted among social networking users at Carnegie Mellon University was indicative of following as reasons for lack of user awareness: 1) People's disregard of privacy risks due to trust in privacy and protection offered on social networking sites. 2) Availability of user's personal details to third-party tools/applications. 3) APIs and Frameworks also enable any user, who has the fair amount of knowledge to extract the user's data. 4) Cross-site forgery and other possible website threats. There is hence a dire need for improving User's awareness swiftly, in order to address growing security and privacy concerns caused due to merely user's unawareness. Social networking sites themselves can take a responsibility and make such awareness possible by means of participatory methods by virtual online means. To improve user's awareness, a possible method is to have privacy-related trainings for people to understand privacy concerns with the use of social media websites or apps. The trainings can include information of how certain companies or apps help secure user's privacy, and skills to protect user's privacy. Data access methods There are several ways for third parties to access user information. Flickr is an example of a social media website that provides geotagged photos that allows users to view the exact location of where a person is visiting or staying. Geotagged photos make it easy for third party users to see where an individual is located or traveling to. There is also growing use of phishing, which reveals sensitive information through secretive links and downloads through email, messages, and other communications. Social media has opened up an entirely new realm for hackers to get information from normal posts and messages. =Share it with third parties= Nearly all of the most popular applications on Facebook—including Farmville, Causes, and Quiz Planet—have been sharing users' information with advertising and tracking companies. Even though Facebook's privacy policy says they can provide \\"any of the non-personally identifiable attributes we have collected\\" to advertisers, they violate this policy. If a user clicked a specific ad in a page, Facebook will send the user address of this page to advertisers, which will directly lead to a profile page. In this case, it is easy to identify users' names. For example, Take With Me Learning is an app that allows teachers and students to keep track of their academic process. The app requires personal information that includes, school name, user's name, email, and age. But Take With Me Learning was created by a company that was known for illegally gathering student's personal information without their knowledge and selling it to advertisement companies. This company had violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), used to keep children safe from identity theft while using the internet. Most recently, Facebook has been scrutinized for the collection of users' data by Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica was collecting data from Facebook users after they agreed to take a psychology questionnaire. Not only could Cambridge Analytica access the data of the person who took the survey, they could also access all of the data of that person's Facebook friends. This data was then used to hopefully sway people's’ beliefs in hopes that they would vote for a certain politician. While what Cambridge Analytica did by collecting the data may or may not be illegal, they then transferred the data they acquired to third parties so that it could be used to sway voters. Facebook was fined £500,000 in the UK, $5bn (£4bn) in the US, and in 2020, the company was taken to court by Australia's privacy regulator with the perspective of imposing a fine of A$1.7m (£860,000). =API= Application programming interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. By using query language, sharing content and data between communities and applications became much easier. APIs simplify all that by limiting outside program access to a specific set of features—often enough, requests for data of one sort or another. APIs clearly define exactly how a program will interact with the rest of the software world—saving time. An API allows software to “speak with other software.” Furthermore, an API can collect and provide information that is not publicly accessible. This is extremely enticing for researchers due to the greater number of possible avenues of research. The use of an API for data collection can be a focal point of the privacy conversation, because while the data can be anonymous, the difficulty is understanding when it becomes an invasion of privacy. Personal information can be collected en masse, but the debate over whether it breaches personal privacy is due to the inability to match this information with specific people. There have however been some concerns with API because of the recent scandal between Facebook and the political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica. What happened was “Facebook allowed a third-party developer to engineer an application for the sole purpose of gathering data. And the developer was able to exploit a loophole to gather information on not only people who used the app but all their friends — without them knowing.” =Search engines= Search engines are an easy way to find information without scanning every site yourself. Keywords that are typed into a search box will lead to the results. So it is necessary to make sure that the keywords typed are precise and correct. There are many such search engines, some of which may lead the user to fake sites which may obtain personal information or are laden with viruses. Furthermore, some search engines, like DuckDuckGo, will not violate the user's privacy. =Location data= On most social media websites, user's geographical location can be gathered either by users (through voluntary check-in applications like Foursquare and Facebook Places) or by applications (through technologies like IP address geolocation, cellphone network triangulation, RFID and GPS). The approach used matters less than the result which holds that the content produced is coupled with the geographical location where the user produced it. Additionally, many applications attach the contents of other forms of information like OS language, device type and capture time. The result is that by posting, tweeting or taking pictures, users produce and share an enormous amount of personal information. Benefit from data This accessible data along with data mining technology, users' information can be used in different ways to improve customer service. According to what you retweet, what you like and the hashtag, Twitter can recommend some topics and advertisements. Twitter's suggestions for whom to follow is done by this recommendation system. Commerce, such as Amazon, make use of users' information to recommend items for users. Recommendations are based on at least prior purchases, shopping cart, and wishlist. Affinity analysis is a data mining technique that used to understand the purchase behavior of customers. By using machine learning method, whether a user is a potential follower of Starbucks can be predicted. In that case, it is possible to improve the quality and coverage of applications. In addition, user profiles can be used to identify similar users. According to Gary Kovacs's speech about Tracking our online trackers, when he used the internet to find an answer to a question, \\"We are not even 2 bites into breakfast and there are already nearly 25 sites that are tracking me\\", and he was navigated by 4 of them. Privacy concerns Studies have shown that people's belief in the right to privacy is the most pivotal predictor in their attitudes concerning online privacy.Yao, M.Z., &Zhang;, J. (2008). Predicting user concerns about online privacy in Hong Kong. Cyberpsychology & Behavior, 11(6). 779–781. Dio:10.1089/cpb.2007.0252  Social profiling and 3rd party disclosure  The Privacy Act of 1974 (a United States federal law) states: ::\\"No agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains [subject to 12 exceptions].\\" 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b). Disclosure in this context refers to any means of communication, be it written, oral, electronic or mechanical. This states that agencies are forbidden to give out, or disclose, the information of an individual without being given consent by the individual to release that information. However, it falls on the individual to prove that a wrongful disclosure, or disclosure in general, has occurred. Because of this social networking sites such as Facebook ask for permission when a third-party application is requesting the user's information. Although The Privacy Act of 1974 does a lot to limit privacy invasion through third party disclosure, it does list a series of twelve exceptions that deem disclosure permissible: ::1. For members of an agency who need such information \\"in the performance of their duties\\". ::2. If the Freedom of Information Act requires such information ::3. If the information that is disclosed \\"is compatible with the purpose for which it was collected\\". ::4. If the Bureau of Census needs such information to complete a particular census. ::5. If the third party explicitly informs the individual that the information collected will serve only as a form of \\"statistical research\\" and is not \\"individually identifiable\\". ::6. If it is historically relevant to be added to the National Archives and Records Administration. ::7. If such information was requested by a law enforcement agency. ::8. If such information is deemed beneficial to the \\"health or safety of an individual\\". ::9. If such information is requested by the House of Congress or by one of its subcommittees. ::10. If such information is requested by the head of the Government Accountability Office or by one \\"of his authorized representatives\\". ::11. If such information is requested through a court order. ::12. If such information is requested through the Debt Collection Act. Social profiling allows for Facebook and other social networking media websites of filtering through the advertisements, assigning specific ones to specific age groups, gender groups, and even ethnicities.Harris, Wil. June 2006. Retrieved from Data aggregation sites like Spokeo have highlighted the feasibility of aggregating social data across social sites as well as integrating it with public records. A 2011 study Danesh Irani, Steve Webb, Calton Pu, Kang Li, \\"Modeling Unintended Personal-Information Leakage from Multiple Online Social Networks,\\" IEEE Internet Computing, May–June 2011. Retrieved from http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/ic/2011/03/mic2011030013-abs.html highlighted these issues by measuring the amount of unintended information leakage over a large number of users with the varying number of social networks. It identified and measured information that could be used in attacks against what-you-know security.

Retrieved from http://www.research.att.com/~bala/papers/wosn09.pdf have also pointed to most social networks unintentionally providing 3rd party advertising and tracking sites with personal information. It raises the issue of private information inadvertently being sent to 3rd party advertising sites via Referrer strings or cookies. Civil libertarians worry that social networking sites, particularly Facebook, have greatly diminished user confidentiality in numerous ways. For one thing, when social media platforms store private data, they also have complete access to that material as well. To sustain their profitability, applications like Facebook examine and market personal information by logging data through cookies, small files that stockpile the data on someone's device. Companies, such as Facebook, carry extensive amounts of private user information on file, regarding individuals’ , “likes, dislikes, and preferences”, which are of high value to marketers. As Facebook reveals user information to advertising and marketing organizations, personalized endorsements will appear on news feeds based on “surfing behavior, hobbies, or pop culture preferences”. For those reasons, Facebook's critics fear that social networking companies may seek business ventures with stockholders by sharing user information in the exchange of profits. Additionally, they argue that since Facebook demonstrates an illusion of privacy presented by a “for-friends-only” type of platform, individuals find themselves more inclined to showcase more personal information online. According to the critics, users might notice that the sponsorships and commercials are tailored to their disclosed private data, which could result in a sense of betrayal. Institutional A number of institutions have expressed concern over the lack of privacy granted to users on social networking sites. These include schools, libraries, and Government agencies. =Libraries= Libraries in the particular, being concerned with the privacy of individuals, have debated on allowing library patrons to access social networking sites on public library computers. While only 19% of librarians reportedly express real concern over social networking privacy, they have been particularly vocal in voicing their concerns.Fernandez, P. 2009. Online Social Networking Sites and Privacy: Revisiting Ethical Considerations for a New Generation of Technology. [online]. Available at: http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1250&context;=libphilprac [Accessed 25 April 2011] Some have argued that the lack of privacy found on social networking sites is contrary to the ethics supported by Library organizations, and the latter should thus be extremely apprehensive about dealing with the former. Supporters of this view present their argument from the code of ethics held by both the American Library Association and the UK based Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals, which affirms a commitment to upholding privacy as a fundamental right. In 2008, a study was performed in fourteen public libraries in the UK which found that 50% blocked access to social networking sites.McMenemy, D. 2008. Internet access in UK public libraries: notes and queries from a small scale study [abstract only]. Library Review [online]. Available at: http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?issn=0024-2535&volume;=57&issue;=7&articleid;=1740622&show;=html [Accessed 25 April 2011] Many school libraries have also blocked Facebook out of fear that children may be disclosing too much information on Facebook. However, as of 2011, Facebook has taken efforts to combat this concern by deleting profiles of users under the age of thirteen.Smith, C. 2011. Facebook Removes 20, 000 Underage Users Every Day. The Huffington Post. [online]. Available at: [Accessed 25 April 2011] Potential dangers=Identity theft As there is so much information provided other things can be deduced, such as the person's social security number, which can then be used as part of identity theft. In 2009, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University published a study showing that it is possible to predict most and sometimes all of an individual's 9-digit Social Security number using information gleaned from social networks and online databases. (See Predicting Social Security Numbers from Public Data by Acquisti and Gross). In response, various groups have advised that users either do not display their number, or hide it from Facebook 'friends' they do not personally know.myID.com. 2011.

Kids' pictures on Facebook exposes them to identity theft. [online]. Available at: [Accessed 25 April 2011] According to the Huffington Post, Bulgarian IT consultant Bogomil Shopov claimed in a recent blog to have purchased personal information on more than 1 million Facebook users, for the shockingly low price of US$5.00. The data reportedly included users' full names, email addresses, and links to their Facebook pages. The following information could be used to steal the users' identities : Full names including middle name, date of birth, hometown, relationship status, residential information, other hobbies and interest. Preteens and early teenagers Among all other age groups, in general, the most vulnerable victims of private-information-sharing behavior are preteens and early teenagers. According to research, many teens report that social media and social networking services are important to building relationships and friendships. With this fact comes privacy concerns such as identity theft, stealing of personal information, and data usage by advertising companies. Besides from using social media to connect, teenagers use social networking services for political purposes and obtaining information. However, sometimes social media can become the place for harassment and disrespectful political debates that fuels resentment and rises privacy concerns. There have been age restrictions put on numerous websites but how effective they are is debatable. Findings have unveiled that informative opportunities regarding internet privacy as well as concerns from parents, teachers, and peers, play a significant role in impacting the internet user's behavior in regards to online privacy.Chai S, Bagchi-Sen S, Morrell C, Rao H, Upadhyaya S.

Additionally, other studies have also found that the heightening of adolescents' concern towards their privacy will also lead to a greater probability that they will utilize privacy-protecting behaviors.Moscardelli D, Divine R. Adolescents' Concern for Privacy When Using the Internet: An Empirical Analysis of Predictors and Relationships with Privacy-Protecting Behaviors. Family And Consumer Sciences Research Journal [serial online]. March 2007;35(3):232–252. Available from: PsycINFO, Ipswich, MA. Accessed February 6, 2012. In the technological culture that society is developing into, not only should adolescents' and parent's awareness be risen, but society as a whole should acknowledge the importance of online privacy. Preteens and early teenagers are particularly susceptible to social pressures that encourage young people to reveal personal data when posting online. Teens often post information about their personal life, such as activities they are doing, sharing their current locations, who they spend time with, as well their thoughts and opinions. They tend to share this information because they do not want to feel left out or judged by other adolescents who are practicing these sharing activities already. Teens are motivated to keep themselves up to date with the latest gossip, current trends, and trending news and, in doing so they are allowing themselves to become victims of cyberbullying, stalking, and in the future, could potentially harm them when pursuing job opportunities, and in the context of privacy, become more inclined to share their private information to the public. This is concerning because preteens and teenagers are the least educated on how public social media is, how to protect themselves online, and the detrimental consequences that could come from sharing too much personal information online. As more and more young individuals are joining social media sites, they believe it is acceptable to post whatever they are thinking, as they don't realize the potential harm that information can do to them and how they are sacrificing their own privacy.Murphy, Kate. \\"We Want Privacy, but Can't Stop Sharing.\\" Sunday Review.

Preteens and teenagers are sharing information on social media sites such as Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, and more by posting pictures and videos of themselves unaware of the privacy they are sacrificing.Wexler, Evan, and Cecily Taylor. \\"What Are Teens Doing Online?\\" PBS. Public Broadcasting Service, 18 February 2014. Web. 1 March 2017. Adolescents post their real name, birthdays, and email addresses to their social media profiles. Children have less mobility than they have had in the past. Everything these teenagers do online is so they can stay in the loop of social opportunities, and the concern with this is that they do this in a way that is not only traceable but in a very persistent environment that motivates people to continue sharing information about themselves as well. California is also taking steps to protect the privacy of some social media users from users’ own judgments. In 2013, California enacted a law that would require social media sites to allow young registered users to erase their own comments from sites. This is a first step in the United States toward the “right to be forgotten” that has been debated around the world over the past decade. Sexual predators Most major social networking sites are committed to ensuring that use of their services are as safe as possible. However, due to the high content of personal information placed on social networking sites, as well as the ability to hide behind a pseudo-identity, such sites have become increasingly popular for sexual prostetuited [online].https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/03/thousands-of-myspace-sex-offender- refugees-found-on-facebook/ [Accessed: 24 April 2011] Further, lack of age verification mechanisms is a cause of concern in these social networking platforms. However, it was also suggested that the majority of these simply transferred to using the services provided by Facebook.Facebook Help Center. 2011. How can I report a convicted sex offender?

Available at: http://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=15160 [Accessed 24 April 2011] While the numbers may remain small, it has been noted that the number of sexual prostetuites caught using social networking sites has been increasing, and has now reached an almost weekly basis.Randall, D. and Richards, V.

Stalking The potential ability for stalking users on social networking sites has been noted and shared. Popular social networking sites make it easy to build a web of friends and acquaintances and share with them your photos, whereabouts, contact information, and interests without ever getting the chance to actually meet them. With the amount of information that users post about themselves online, it is easy for users to become a victim of stalking without even being aware of the risk. 63% of Facebook profiles are visible to the public, meaning if you Google someone's name and you add \\"+Facebook\\" in the search bar you pretty much will see most of the person profile. A study of Facebook profiles from students at Carnegie Mellon University revealed that about 800 profiles included current resident and at least two classes being studied, theoretically allowing viewers to know the precise location of individuals at specific times.Gross, R. and Acquisti, A. 2005.

AOL attracted controversy over its instant messenger AIM which permits users to add 'buddies' without their knowing, and therefore track when a user is online. Concerns have also been raised over the relative ease for people to read private messages or e-mails on social networking sites.Malone, S. 2005.

A cyberstalking conviction can result in a restraining order, probation, or even criminal penalties against the assailant, including jail. Some applications are explicitly centered on \\"cyber stalking.\\" An application named \\"Creepy\\" can track a person's location on a map using photos uploaded to Twitter or Flickr. When a person uploads photos to a social networking site, others are able to track their most recent location. Some smartphones are able to embed the longitude and latitude coordinates into the photo and automatically send this information to the application. Anybody using the application can search for a specific person and then find their immediate location. This poses many potential threats to users who share their information with a large group of followers.Retrieved from: https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/smartphone-apps-tracking-keeping-tabs-past- lovers-people/story?id=13022144 Facebook \\"Places,\\" is a Facebook service, which publicizes user location information to the networking community. Users are allowed to \\"check-in\\" at various locations including retail stores, convenience stores, and restaurants. Also, users are able to create their own \\"place,\\" disclosing personal information onto the Internet. This form of location tracking is automated and must be turned off manually. Various settings must be turned off and manipulated in order for the user to ensure privacy. According to epic.org, Facebook users are recommended to: (1) disable \\"Friends can check me in to Places,\\" (2) customize \\"Places I Check In,\\" (3) disable \\"People Here Now,\\" and (4) uncheck \\"Places I've Visited.\\".EPIC – In re Facebook. (n.d.). EPIC – Electronic Privacy Information Center.

Each location tracked allows third party advertisers to customize advertisements that suit one's interests. Currently, the Federal Trade Commissioner along with the Electronic Privacy Information Center are shedding light on the issues of location data tracking on social networking sites. Unintentional fame Unintentional fame can harm a person's character, reputation, relationships, chance of employment, and privacy- ultimately infringing upon a person's right to the pursuit of happiness. Many cases of unintentional fame have led its victims to take legal action. The right to be forgotten is a legal concept that includes removing one's information from the media that was once available to the public. The right to be forgotten is currently enforced in the European Union and Argentina, and has been recognized in various cases in the United States, particularly in the case of Melvin v. Reid. However, there is controversy surrounding the right to be forgotten in the United States as it conflicts with the public's right to know and the Constitution's First Amendment, restricting one's “right to freedom of speech and freedom of expression” (Amendment I). Privacy concerns have also been raised over a number of high-profile incidents which can be considered embarrassing for users. Various internet memes have been started on social networking sites or been used as a means towards their spread across the internet. In 2002, a Canadian teenager became known as the Star Wars Kid after a video of him using a golf club as a light sabre was posted on the internet without his consent. The video quickly became a hit, much to the embarrassment of the teenager, who claims to have suffered as a result.Bennet, J. n.d. Internet Memes. [online]. Available at: [Accessed 25 April 2011] Along with other incidents of videos being posted on social networking sites, this highlights the ability for personal information to be rapidly transferred between users. Employment Issues relating to privacy and employment are becoming a concern with regards to social networking sites. As of 2008, it has been estimated by CareerBuilder.com that one in five employers search social networking sites in order to screen potential candidates (increasing from only 11% in 2006).Havenstein, H. 2008. One in five employers uses social networks in the hiring process. [online]. Available at: http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9114560/One_in_five_employers_uses_social_networks_in_hiring_process [Accessed 24 April 2011] For the majority of employers, such action is to acquire negative information about candidates. For example, 41% of managers considered information relating to candidates' alcohol and drug use to be a top concern. Other concerns investigated via social networking sites included poor communication skills, inappropriate photographs, inaccurate qualifications and bad-mouthing former employers/colleagues. However, 24% manager claimed that information found on a social networking site persuaded them to hire a candidate, suggesting that a user image can be used in a positive way. While there is little doubt that employers will continue to use social networking sites as a means of monitoring staff and screening potential candidates, it has been noted that such actions may be illegal under in jurisdictions. According to Workforce.com, employers who use Facebook or Myspace could potentially face legal action: If a potential employer uses a social networking site to check out a job candidate and then rejects that person based on what they see, he or she could be charged with discrimination.Bowers, T. 2008. Employers who check out job candidates on MySpace could be legally liable. [online].

A number of other states that are also considering such prohibitory legislation (California, Delaware, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, South Carolina and Washington), as is the United States Congress. In April 2012, the Social Networking Online Protection Act (2012 H.R. 5050) was introduced in the United States House of Representatives, and the Password Protection Act of 2012 (2012 S. 3074) was introduced in the United States Senate in May 2012, which prohibit employers from requiring access to their employees' social media web sites. With the recent concerns about new technologies, the United States is now developing laws and regulations to protect certain aspects of people's information on different medias.[CR4] For example, 12 states in the US currently have laws specifically restricting employers from demanding access to their employees’ social media sites when those sites are not fully public. (The states that have passed these laws are Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Washington.) Monitoring of social networking sites is not limited to potential workers. Issues relating to privacy are becoming an increasing concern for those currently in employment. A number of high-profile cases have appeared in which individuals have been sacked for posting comments on social networking which have been considered disparaging to their current employers or fellow workers. In 2009, sixteen-year-old Kimberley Swann was sacked from her position at Ivell Marketing and Logistics Limited after describing her job as 'boring'.Sky News. 2009. Sacked for Calling Job Boring on Facebook. [online].

In fact, employers can even hire third- party companies to monitor online employee activity for them. According to an article by Read Write Web employers use the service to \\"make sure that employees don't leak sensitive information on social networks or engage in any behavior that could damage a company's reputation.\\" While employers may have found such usages of social networking sites convenient, complaints have been put forward by civil liberties groups and trade unions on the invasive approach adopted by many employers. In response to the Kimberley Swann case, Brendan Barber, of the TUC union stated that: Most employers wouldn't dream of following their staff down the pub to see if they were sounding off about work to their friends,\\" he said. \\"Just because snooping on personal conversations is possible these days, it doesn't make it healthy.\\" Monitoring of staff's social networking activities is also becoming an increasingly common method of ensuring that employees are not browsing websites during work hours. It was estimated in 2010 that an average of two million employees spent over an hour a day on social networking sites, costing potentially £14 billion.Roythornes Solicitors. 2011.

However, some individuals engage in undesirable online social behaviors, which negatively impacts other people's online experiences. It has created a wide range of online interpersonal victimization. Some studies have shown that social network victimization appears largely in adolescent and teens, and the type of victimization includes sexual advances and harassment. Recent research has reported approximately 9% of online victimization involves social network activities. It has been noted that many of these victims are girls who have been sexually victimized over these social network sites. Research concludes that many of social network victimizations are associated with user behaviors and interaction with one another. Negative social behaviors such as aggressive attitudes and discussing sexual related topics motivate the offenders to achieve their goals. All in all, positive online social behaviors is promoted to help reduce and avoid online victimization. Surveillance While the concept of a worldwide communicative network seems to adhere to the public sphere model, market forces control access to such a resource. In 2010, investigation by The Wall Street Journal found that many of the most popular applications on Facebook were transmitting identifying information about users and their friends to advertisers and internet tracking companies, which is a violation of Facebook's privacy policy. The Wall Street Journal analyzed the ten most popular Facebook apps, including Zynga's FarmVille with 57 million users, and Zynga's Mafia Wars with 21.9 million users, and found that they were transmitting Facebook user IDs to data aggregators. Every online move leaves cyber footprints that are rapidly becoming fodder for research without people ever realizing it. Using social media for academic research is accelerating and raising ethical concerns along the way, as vast amounts of information collected by private companies — including Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter — are giving new insight into all aspects of everyday life. Our social media \\"audience\\" is bigger than we actually know; our followers or friends aren't the only ones that can see information about us. Social media sites are collecting data from us just by searching something such as \\"favorite restaurant\\" on our search engine. Facebook is transformed from a public space to a behavioral laboratory,\\" says the study, which cites a Harvard-based research project of 1,700 college-based Facebook users in which it became possible to \\"deanonymize parts of the data set,\\" or cross-reference anonymous data to make student identification possible. Some of Facebook's research on user behavior found that 71% of people drafted at least one post that they never posted. Another analyzed 400,000 posts and found that children's communication with parents decreases in frequency from age 13 but then rises when they move out. Law enforcement prowling the networks The FBI has dedicated undercover agents on Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, LinkedIn. One example of investigators using Facebook to nab a criminal is the case of Maxi Sopo. Charged with bank fraud, and having escaped to Mexico, he was nowhere to be found until he started posting on Facebook. Although his profile was private, his list of friends was not, and through this vector, where he met a former official of the Justice Department, he was eventually caught .Richard Lardner. (March 16, 2010). Your new Facebook 'friend' may be the FBI. Retrieved from http://www.nbcnews.com/id/35890739 In recent years, some state and local law enforcement agencies have also begun to rely on social media websites as resources. Although obtaining records of information not shared publicly by or about site users often requires a subpoena, public pages on sites such as Facebook and MySpace offer access to personal information that can be valuable to law enforcement.Harkins, Gina. (March 2, 2011). Cops patrol social networking sites for gang activity.

This announcement, which was made relatively quietly, has received criticism from privacy advocates. The Department of Homeland Security issued a statement in late September 2017 asserting that the planned use of social media is nothing new, with one department spokesperson saying DHS has been using social media to collect information for years. According to a statement made to National Public Radio, DHS uses “...social media handles, aliases, associated identifiable information, and search results” to keep updated records on persons of interest. According to the DHS, the posting to the Federal Register was an effort to be transparent regarding information about social media that is already being collected from immigrants. Government use of SMMS or “Social media monitoring software can be used to geographically track us as we communicate. It can chart out our relationships, networks, and associations. It can monitor protests, identify the leaders of political and social movements, and measure our influence.” SMMS is also a growing industry. SMMS “products like XI Social Discovery, Geofeedia, Dataminr, Dunami, and SocioSpyder (to name just a few) are being purchased in droves by Fortune 500 companies, politicians, law enforcement, federal agencies, defense contractors, and the military. Even the CIA has a venture fund, In-Q-Tel, that invests in SMMS technology.” Mob rule The idea of the 'mob rule' can be described as a situation in which control is held by those outside the conventional or lawful realm. In response to the News International phone hacking scandal involving News of the World in the United Kingdom, a report was written to enact new media privacy regulations. The British author of the Leveson Report on the ethics of the British press, Lord Justice Leveson, has drawn attention to the need to take action on protecting privacy on the internet. This movement is described by Lord Justice Leveson as a global megaphone for gossip: \\"There is not only a danger of trial by Twitter, but also of an unending punishment, and no prospect of rehabilitation, by Google\\". Location updates Foursquare, Facebook, Loopt are application which allow users to check- in and these capabilities allows a user to share their current location information to their connection. Some of them even update their travel plans on social networking applications. However, the disclosure of location information within these networks can cause privacy concerns among mobile users. Foursquare defines another framework of action for the user. It appears to be in the interest of Foursquare that users provide many personal data that are set as public. This is illustrated, among others, by the fact that, although all the respondents want high control over the (location) privacy settings, almost none of them ever checked the Foursquare privacy settings before. Although there are algorithms using encryption, k-anonymity and noise injection algorithms, its better to understand how the location sharing works in these applications to see if they have good algorithms in place to protect location privacy. Invasive privacy agreements Another privacy issue with social networks is the privacy agreement. The privacy agreement states that the social network owns all of the content that users upload. This includes pictures, videos, and messages are all stored in the social networks database even if the user decides to terminate his or her account. Privacy agreements oftentimes say that they can track a user's location and activity based on the device used for the site. For example, the privacy agreement for Facebook states that \\"all devices that a person uses to access Facebook are recorded such as IP addresses, phone numbers, operating system and even GPS locations\\". One main concern about privacy agreements are the length, because they take a lot of time to fully read and understand. Most privacy agreements state the most important information at the end because it is assumed that people will not read it completely. The ethical dilemma lies in that upon the agreement to register for SNSs, the personal information disclosed is legally accessible and managed by the sites privately established online security operators and operating systems; leaving access of user data to be \\"under the discretion\\" of the site(s) operators. Giving rise to the moral obligation and responsibility of the sites operators to maintain private information to be within user control. However, due to the legality of outsourcing of user data upon registration- without prior discretion, data outsourcing has been frequented by SNSs operating systems- regardless of user privacy settings. Data outsourcing has been proven to be consistently exploited since the emergence of SNSs. Employers have often been found to hire individuals or companies to search deep into the SNSs user database to find \\"less than pleasant\\" information regarding applicants during the review process. Reading a privacy statement in terms and conditions One of the main concerns that people have with their security is the lack of visibility that policies and settings have in the social networks. It is often located in areas hard to see like the top left or right of the screen. Another concern is the lack of information that users get from the companies when there is a change in their policies. They always inform users about new updates, but it is difficult to get information about these changes. Most social networking sites require users to agree to Terms of Use policies before they use their services. Controversially, these Terms of Use declarations that users must agree to often contain clauses permitting social networking operators to store data on users, or even share it with third parties. Facebook has attracted attention over its policies regarding data storage, such as making it difficult to delete an account, holding onto data after an account is de- activated and being caught sharing personal data with third parties.Bangeman, E. 2010. Report: Facebook caught sharing secret data with advisers. [online]. Available at: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/05/latest- facebook-blunder-secret-data-sharing-with-advertisers.ars [Accessed 25 April 2011] This section explains how to read the privacy statement in terms and conditions while signing up for any social networking site. What to look for in the privacy policy: # Who owns the data that a user posts? # What happens to the data when the user account is closed? # How does changes in the privacy policy be made aware to its users? # The location of the privacy policy that is effective # Will the profile page be completely erased when a user deletes the account? # Where and how can a user complain in case of any breach in privacy? # For how long is the personal information stored? The answers to these questions will give an indication of how safe the social networking site is. Key points to protect social networking privacy=Realize the threats that will always exist There are people out there who want—and will do just about anything—to get someone's private information. It's essential to realize that it's difficult to keep your privacy secured all the time. Among other factors, it has been observed that data loss is correlated positively with risky online behavior and forgoing the necessary antivirus and anti spyware programs to defend against breaches of private information via the internet. Be thorough all the time Always log out. It is dangerous to keep your device logged on since others may have access to your social profiles while you are not paying attention. Keep your full name and address to yourself. Children's safety may be compromised if their parents post their whereabouts in a site where others know who their real identities are. Know the sites Read the social networking site's fine prints. Many sites push its users to agree to terms that are best for the sites—not the users. Users should be aware about the terms in case of emergencies. Exactly how to read the terms are explained above at \\"Reading a Privacy Statement in Terms and Conditions\\" part Make sure the social networking site is safe before sharing information. Users shouldn't be sharing information if they don't know who are using the websites since their personally identifiable information could be exposed to other users of the site. Be familiar with the privacy protection provided. Users should take the extra time to get to know the privacy protection systems of various social networks they are or will be using. Only friends should be allowed to access their information. Check the privacy or security settings on every social networking site that they might have to use. Protect devices Encrypt devices. Users should use complex passwords on their computers and cell phones and change them from time to time. This will protect users' information in case these devices are stolen. Install Anti-virus software. Others would be able to use viruses and other ways to invade a user's computer if he or she installed something unsafe. Use devices that can disable camera, microphone, which mostly used for privacy invasion. Be careful about taking drastic actions The users' privacy may be threatened by any actions. Following actions needs special attention. (1) Adding a new friend. Facebook reports 8.7% of its total profiles are fake. A user should be sure about who the person is before adding it as a new friend. (2) Clicking on links. Many links which looks attractive like gift cards are specially designed by malicious users. Clicking on these links may result in losing personal information or money. (3) Think twice about posting revealing photos. A revealing photo could attract the attention of potential criminals. Social networks=Facebook Facebook has been scrutinized for a variety of privacy concerns due to changes in its privacy settings on the site generally over time as well as privacy concerns within Facebook applications. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, first launched Facebook in 2004, it was focused on universities and only those with .edu address could open an account. Furthermore, only those within one's university network could see their page. Some argue that initial users were much more willing to share private information for these reasons. As time went on, Facebook became more public allowing those outside universities, and furthermore, those without a specific network, to join and see pages of those in networks that were not their own. In 2006 Facebook introduced the News Feed, a feature that would highlight recent friend activity. By 2009, Facebook made \\"more and more information public by default\\". For example, in December 2009, \\"Facebook drastically changed its privacy policies, allowing users to see each others' lists of friends, even if users had previously indicated they wanted to keep these lists private\\". Also, \\"the new settings made photos publicly available by default, often without users' knowledge\\". Facebook recently updated its profile format allowing for people who are not \\"friends\\" of others to view personal information about other users, even when the profile is set to private. However, As of January 18, 2011 Facebook changed its decision to make home addresses and telephone numbers accessible to third party members, but it is still possible for third party members to have access to less exact personal information, like one's hometown and employment, if the user has entered the information into Facebook. EPIC Executive Director Marc Rotenberg said \\"Facebook is trying to blur the line between public and private information. And the request for permission does not make clear to the user why the information is needed or how it will be used.\\"Electronic Privacy Information Center, Initials. (2011, January 18). Facebook drops plan to disclose users' home addresses and personal phone number. Retrieved from http://epic.org/privacy/socialnet/ Breakup Notifier is an example of a Facebook \\"cyberstalking\\" app, which was taken down on 23 February 2011. The app was later unblocked. The application notifies the user when the person they selected changes their relationship status. The concept became very popular, with the site attracting 700,000 visits in the first 36 hours and the app being downloaded 40,000 times. Before the app was blocked, it had more than 3.6 million downloads and 9,000 Facebook likes. In 2008, four years after the first introduction of Facebook, Facebook created an option to permanently delete information. Until then, the only option was to deactivate one's Facebook account, which still left the user's information within Facebook servers. After thousands of users complaints, Facebook obliged and created a tool which was located in the Help Section but later removed. To locate the tool to permanently delete a user's Facebook, he or she must manually search through Facebook's Help section by entering the request to delete the Facebook in the search box. Only then will a link be provided to prompt the user to delete his or her profile. These new privacy settings enraged some users, one of whom claimed, \\"Facebook is trying to dupe hundreds of millions of users they've spent years attracting into exposing their data for Facebook's personal gain.\\" However, other features like the News Feed faced an initial backlash but later became a fundamental and very much appreciated part of the Facebook experience. In response to user complaints, Facebook continued to add more and more privacy settings resulting in \\"50 settings and more than 170 privacy options.\\" However, many users complained that the new privacy settings were too confusing and were aimed at increasing the amount of public information on Facebook. Facebook management responded that \\"there are always trade offs between providing comprehensive and precise granular controls and offering simple tools that may be broad and blunt.\\" It appears as though users sometimes do not pay enough attention to privacy settings and arguably allow their information to be public even though it is possible to make it private. Studies have shown that users actually pay little attention to \\"permissions they give to third party apps.\\" Most users are not aware that they can modify the privacy settings and unless they modify them, their information is open to the public. On Facebook privacy settings can be accessed via the drop down menu under account in the top right corner. There users can change who can view their profile and what information can be displayed on their profile.Facebook's Privacy Policy. (2010). Retrieved from https://www.facebook.com/policy.php In most cases profiles are open to either \\"all my network and friends\\" or \\"all of my friends.\\" Also, information that shows on a user's profile such as birthday, religious views, and relationship status can be removed via the privacy settings.Lipford, H. R., Besmer, A. & Watson, J. (2009). Understanding Privacy Settings in Facebook with an Audience View. Department of Software and Information Systems University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Retrieved from http://www.usenix.org/events/upsec08/tech/full_papers/lipford/lipford_html/ If a user is under 13 years old they are not able to make a Facebook or a MySpace account, however, this is not regulated. Although Zuckerberg, the Facebook CEO, and others in the management team usually respond in some manner to user concerns, they have been unapologetic about the trend towards less privacy. They have stated that they must continually \\"be innovating and updating what our system is to reflect what the current social norms are.\\" Their statements suggest that the Internet is becoming a more open, public space, and changes in Facebook privacy settings reflect this. However, Zuckerberg did admit that in the initial release of the News Feed, they \\"did a bad job of explaining what the new features were and an even worse job of giving you control of them.\\" Facebook's privacy settings have greatly evolved and are continuing to change over time. Zuckerberg \\"believes the age of privacy is 'over,' and that norms have evolved considerably since he first co-founded the social networking site\\".Bianca Bosker, Virtual Guide To Facebook's Privacy Changes Over Time, 2010. Retrieved from http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/07/facebook-privacy- changes_n_568345.html Additionally, Facebook has been under fire for keeping track of one's Internet usage whether users are logged into the social media site or not. A user may notice personalized ads under the 'Sponsored' area of the page. \\"The company uses cookies to log data such as the date, time, URL, and your IP address whenever you visit a site that has a Facebook plug-in, such as a 'Like' button.\\"Luckerson, 7 Controversial Ways Facebook Has Used Your Data, 2014. Retrieved from http://time.com/4695/7-controversial-ways- facebook-has-used-your-data/ Facebook claims this data is used to help improve one's experience on the website and to protect against 'malicious' activity. Another issue of privacy that Facebook uses is the new facial recognition software. This feature includes the software to identify photos that users are tagged in by developing a template based on one's facial features. Similar to Rotenberg's claim that Facebook users are unclear of how or why their information has gone public, recently the Federal Trade Commission and Commerce Department have become involved. The Federal Trade Commission has recently released a report claiming that Internet companies and other industries will soon need to increase their protection for online users. Because online users often unknowingly opt in on making their information public, the FTC is urging Internet companies to make privacy notes simpler and easier for the public to understand, therefore increasing their option to opt out. Perhaps this new policy should also be implemented in the Facebook world. The Commerce Department claims that Americans, \\"have been ill-served by a patchwork of privacy laws that contain broad gaps,\\".American Civil Liberties Union. (December 16, 2010). Commerce department releases important report urging comprehensive privacy protections. Retrieved from https://www.aclu.org/technology-and-liberty/commerce-department-releases- important-report-urging-comprehensive-privacy-pr Because of these broad gaps, Americans are more susceptible to identity theft and having their online activity tracked by others. =Internet privacy and Facebook advertisements= The illegal activities on Facebook are very widespread, in particular, phishing attacks, allowing attackers to steal other people's passwords. The Facebook users are led to land on a page where they are asked for their login information, and their personal information is stolen in that way. According to the news from PC World Business Center which was published on April 22, 2010, we can know that a hacker named Kirllos illegally stole and sold 1.5 million Facebook IDs to some business companies who want to attract potential customers by using advertisements on Facebook. Their illegal approach is that they used accounts which were bought from hackers to send advertisements to friends of users. When friends see the advertisements, they will have opinion about them, because \\"People will follow it because they believe it was a friend that told them to go to this link,\\" said Randy Abrams, director of technical education with security vendor Eset. There were 2.2232% of the population on Facebook that believed or followed the advertisements of their friends. Even though the percentage is small, the amount of overall users on Facebook is more than 400 million worldwide. The influence of advertisements on Facebook is so huge and obvious. According to the blog of Alan who just posted advertisements on the Facebook, he earned $300 over the 4 days. That means he can earn $3 for every $1 put into it.\\"Profiting with Facebook Ads.\\" affiliate confession. Alan, 13 August 2008. The huge profit attracts hackers to steal users' login information on Facebook, and business people who want to buy accounts from hackers send advertisements to users' friends on Facebook. A leaked document from Facebook has revealed that the company was able to identify \\"insecure, worthless, stressed or defeated\\" emotions, especially in teenagers, and then proceeded to inform advertisers. While similar issues have arisen in the past, this continues to make individuals’ emotional states seem more like a commodity. They are able to target certain age groups depending on the time that their advertisements appear. Recently, there have been allegations made against Facebook accusing the app of listening in on its users through their smartphone's microphone in order to gather information for advertisers. These rumors have been proven to be false as well as impossible. For one, because it does not have a specific buzzword to listen for like the Amazon Echo, Facebook would have to record everything its users say. This kind of “constant audio surveillance would produce about 33 times more data daily than Facebook currently consumes”. Additionally, it would become immediately apparent to the user as their phone's battery life would be swiftly drained by the amount of power it would take to record every conversation. Finally, it is clear that Facebook doesn't need to listen in on its users’ conversations because it already has plenty of access to their data and internet search history through cookies. Facebook specifically states in their Cookies Policy that they use cookies to help display ads that will peak the users interest. They then use this information to help make recommendations for numerous businesses, organizations, associations, etc. to individuals who may be interested in the products, services or causes they offer. =Facebook friends study= A study was conducted at Northeastern University by Alan Mislove and his colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, where an algorithm was created to try and discover personal attributes of a Facebook user by looking at their friend's list. They looked for information such as high school and college attended, major, hometown, graduation year and even what dorm a student may have lived in. The study revealed that only 5% of people thought to change their friend's list to private. For other users, 58% displayed university attended, 42% revealed employers, 35% revealed interests and 19% gave viewers public access to where they were located. Due to the correlation of Facebook friends and universities they attend, it was easy to discover where a Facebook user was based on their list of friends. This fact is one that has become very useful to advertisers targeting their audiences but is also a big risk for the privacy of all those with Facebook accounts.Erik Hayden. (March 11, 2010). On Facebook, You Are Who You Know. Retrieved from http://www.miller- mccune.com/culture-society/on-facebook-you-are-who-you-know-10385/# =Facebook Emotion Study= Recently, Facebook, knowingly agreed and facilitated a controversial experiment; the experiment blatantly bypassed user privacy and demonstrates the dangers and complex ethical nature of the current networking management system. The \\"one week study in January of 2012\\" where over 600,000 users were randomly selected to unknowingly partake in a study to determine the effect of \\"emotional alteration\\" by Facebook posts.Editorial Expression of Concern and Correction Apart from the ethical issue of conducting such a study with human emotion in the first place, this is just one of the means in which data outsourcing has been used as a breach of privacy without user disclosure. Several issues pertaining to Facebook are due to privacy concerns. An article titled \\"Facebook and Online Privacy: Attitudes, Behaviors, and Unintended Consequences\\" examines the awareness that Facebook users have on privacy issues. This study shows that the gratifications of using Facebook tend to outweigh the perceived threats to privacy. The most common strategy for privacy protection—decreasing profile visibility through restricting access to friends—is also a very weak mechanism; a quick fix rather than a systematic approach to protecting privacy. This study suggests that more education about privacy on Facebook would be beneficial to the majority of the Facebook user population. The study also offers the perspective that most users do not realize that restricting access to their data does not sufficiently address the risks resulting from the amount, quality and persistence of data they provide. Facebook users in our study report familiarity and use of privacy settings, they are still accepting people as \\"friends\\" that they have only heard of through other or do not know at all and, therefore, most have very large groups of \\"friends\\" that have access to widely uploaded information such as full names, birthdates, hometowns, and many pictures. This study suggests that social network privacy does not merely exist within the realm of privacy settings, but privacy control is much within the hands of the user. Commentators have noted that online social networking poses a fundamental challenge to the theory of privacy as control. The stakes have been raised because digital technologies lack \\"the relative transience of human memory,\\" and can be trolled or data mined for information. For users who are unaware of all privacy concerns and issues, further education on the safety of disclosing certain types of information on Facebook is highly recommended. Instagram Instagram tracks users' photos even if they do not post them using a geotag. The app geotags an uploaded image regardless of whether the user chose to share its location or not. Therefore, anybody can view the exact location where an image was uploaded on a map. This is concerning due to the fact that most people upload photos from their home or other locations they frequent a lot, and the fact that locations are so easily shared raises privacy concerns of stalking and sexual predators being able to find their target in person after discovering them online.Thompson, C. (May 28, 2015). Social media apps are tracking your location in shocking detail.

Retrieved February 22, 2017, from https://www.thefastmode.com/content-sharing-apps/5450-mining-big-data-the- instagram-way The privacy implications of this fact is that people and companies can now see into every corner of the world, culture, and people's private lives. Additionally, this is concerning for individual privacy, because when someone searches through these features on Instagram for a specific location or place, Instagram shows them the personal photos that their users have posted, along with the likes and comments on that photo regardless of whether the poster's account is private or not. With these features, completely random people, businesses, and governments can see aspects of Instagram users' private lives. The Search and Explore pages that collect data based on user tagging illustrates how Instagram was able to create value out of the databases of information they collect on users throughout their business operations. Swarm Swarm is a mobile app that lets users check-in to a location and potentially make plans and set up future meetings with people nearby. This app has made it easier for people in online communities to share their locations, as well as interact with others in this community through collecting rewards such as coins and stickers through competitions with other users.\\"What Is Foursquare Swarm?\\" Help Center. N.p., n.d. Web. 22 February 2017. From https://support.foursquare.com/hc/en- us/articles/201908440-What-is-Foursquare-Swarm- If a user is on Swarm, their exact location may be broadcast even if they didn't select their location to be \\"checked-in.\\" When users turn on their \\"Neighborhood Sharing\\" feature, their location is shared as the specific intersection that they are at, and this location in current time can be viewed simply by tapping their profile image. This is concerning because Swarm users may believe they are being discreet by sharing only which neighborhood they are in, while in fact they are sharing the exact pinpoint of their location. The privacy implications of this is that people are inadvertently sharing their exact location when they do not know that they are. This plays into the privacy concerns of social media in general, because it makes it easier for other users as well as the companies this location data is shared with to track Swarm members. This tracking makes it easier for people to find their next targets for identity theft, stalking, and sexual harassment.

She was a student of Millersville University of Pennsylvania who was denied her teaching degree because of an allegedly unprofessional photo posted on MySpace, which involved her drinking with a pirate's hat on and a caption of \\"Drunken Pirate\\". As a substitute, she was given an English degree. Other sites Sites such as Sgrouples and Diaspora have attempted to introduce various forms of privacy protection into their networks, while companies like Safe Shepherd have created software to remove personal information from the net. Certain social media sites such as Ask.fm, Whisper, and Yik Yak allow users to interact anonymously. The problem with websites such as these is that “despite safeguards that allow users to report abuse, people on the site believe they can say almost anything without fear or consequences—and they do.\\" This is a privacy concern because users can say whatever they choose and the receiver of the message may never know who they are communicating with. Sites such as these allow for a large chance or cyberbullying or cyberstalking to occur.

These rules were put in place to help Snapchat create new and cool features like being able to replay a Snapchat, and the idea of “live” Snapchat stories. These features require saving content to snapchat servers in order to release to other users at a later time. The update stated that it has the rights to reproduce, modify, and republish photos, as well as save those photos to Snapchat servers. Users felt uncomfortable with the idea that all photo content was saved and the idea of “disappearing photos” advertised by Snapchat didn't actually disappear. There is no way to control what content is saved and what isn't. Snapchat responded to backlash by saying they needed this license to access our information in order to create new features, like the live snapchat feature. =Live Stories= With the 2015 new update of Snapchat, users are able to do “Live Stories,” which are a “collection of crowdsourced snaps for a specific event or region.” By doing that, you are allowing snapchat to share your location with not just your friends, but with everyone. According to Snapchat, once you pick the option of sharing your content through a Live Story, you are providing to the company \\"unrestricted, worldwide, perpetual right and license to use your name, likeness, and voice in any and all media and distribution channels.\\" =Privacy concerns with Snapchat= On Snapchat, there is a new feature that was incorporated into the app in 2017 called Snap Maps. Snap Maps allows users to track other users’ locations, but when people “first use the feature, users can select whether they want to make their location visible to all of their friends, a select group of connections or to no one at all, which Snapchat refers to as ‘ghost mode.’” This feature however has raised privacy concerns because “‘It is very easy to accidentally share everything that you've got with more people than you need too, and that's the scariest portion,’ cyber security expert Charles Tendell told ABC News of the Snapchat update.” For protecting younger users of Snapchat, “Experts recommend that parents stay aware of updates to apps like Snapchat. They also suggest parents make sure they know who their kids' friends are on Snapchat and also talk to their children about who they add on Snapchat.”  Snapchat Spectacles  In 2016, Snapchat released a new product called “Snapchat Spectacles,” which are sunglasses featuring a small camera that allow users to take photos and record up to 10 seconds of footage. The cameras in the Spectacles are connected to users’ existing Snapchat accounts, so they can easily upload their content to the application. This new product has received negative feedback because the Spectacles do not stand out from normal sunglasses beyond the small cameras on the lenses. Therefore, users have the ability to record strangers without them knowing. and could potentially otherwise unwilling of the glasses may not even realize they are any different than a basic pair of shades. Critics of Snapchat Spectacles argue that this product is an invasion of privacy for the people who do not know they are being recorded by individuals who are wearing the glasses. Proponents disagree, saying that the glasses are distinguishable enough that users and people around them will notice them. Another argument in favor of the glasses is that people are already exposing themselves to similar scenarios by being in public.  2016 Amnesty International Report  In October 2016, Amnesty International released a report ranking Snapchat along with ten other leading social media applications, including Facebook, iMessage, FaceTime, and Skype on how well they protect users’ privacy. The report assessed Snapchat's use of encryption and found that it ranks poorly in how it uses encryption to protect users’ security as a result of not using end-to-end encryption. Because of this, third parties have the ability to access Snapchats while they are being transferred from one device to another. The report also claimed that Snapchat does not explicitly inform users in its privacy policy of the application's level of encryption or any threats the application may pose to users’ rights, which further reduced its overall score. Regardless of this report, Snapchat is currently considered the most trustworthy social media platform among users. =The FTC= In 2014, allegations were made against Snapchat by the Federal Trade Commission \\"FTC\\" for deceiving users on its privacy and security measures. Snapchat's main appeal is its marketed ability to have users' photos disappear completely after the one to ten second time frame—selected by the sender to the recipient—is up. However, the FTC made a case claiming this was false, making Snapchat in violation of regulations implemented to prevent deceptive consumer information. One focus of the case was that the reality of a \\"snap\\" lifespan is longer than most users perceive; the app's privacy policy stated that Snapchat itself temporarily stored all snaps sent, but neglected to offer users a time period during which snaps had yet to be permanently deleted and could still be retrieved. As a result, many third party applications were easily created for consumers that hold the ability to save \\"snaps\\" sent by users and screenshot \\"snaps\\" without notifying the sender.\\"Snapchat Settles FTC Charges That Promises of Disappearing Messages Were False.\\" FTC May 8, 2014.

The hide muted status feature allows users to hide specific updates or interactions with specific users; however, if the user would decide to \\"unhide\\" their status or updates from certain users, a list of all updates will be shown to the previously blocked user (including the previously hidden status/updates). Similar to apps such as Snapchat and Instagram, users are notified when a story is forwarded, viewed, screenshotted, or shared. WhatsApp developers have added the Frequently Forwarded feature that notifies users if a message, status, or update has been forwarded 4 or more times. Response to criticism Many social networking organizations have responded to the criticism and concerns over privacy brought up over time. It is claimed that changes to default settings, the storage of data and sharing with third parties have all been updated and corrected in the light of criticism, and/or legal challenges.Shepherd and Wedderburn. 2010.

This method does not succeed, since their information is still revealed by posts from their friends. There is ambiguity about how private IP addresses are. The Court of Justice of the European Union has ruled they need to be treated as personally identifiable information if the business receiving them, or a third party like a service provider, knows the name or street address of the IP address holder, which would be true for static IP addresses, not for dynamic addresses. California regulations say IP addresses need to be treated as personal information if the business itself, not a third party, can link them to name and street address. An Alberta court ruled that police can obtain the IP addresses and the names and addresses associated with them, without a search warrant. An investigation found the IP addresses which initiated online crimes, and the service provider gave police the names and addresses associated with those IP addresses.

He was also active as a folk singer, folk club organiser, and leading light of the Second British Folk Revival.Ken Hunt. \\"John Hasted\\". The Guardian. September 9, 2002. Parapsychology Hasted was a believer in psychokinesis. He endorsed the spoon bending feats of Uri Geller and other alleged psychics. A 1987 report by the United States National Academy of Sciences investigated the paranormal claims of Hasted and chided him for his naiveté for playing into the hands of anyone intending on deceiving him. The report wrote that the conditions of his 1974 tests with Geller did not rule out the possibility of trickery.Kendrick Frazier. (1990). The Hundredth Monkey and Other Paradigms of the Paranormal. Prometheus Books. pp. 159–160. Hasted believed that children could paranormally bend paperclips inside a glass sphere, provided the sphere had a hole in it and they were allowed to take the sphere into a room unobserved. Martin Gardner wrote Hasted was incapable of devising simple controls such as videotaping the children secretly.Martin Gardner. (1991). The New Age: Notes of a Fringe-Watcher. Prometheus Books. pp. 28-29. Stephen North, a British psychic, was tested by Hasted in the late 1970s. Hasted claimed North had the psychokinetic ability to bend spoons and teleport objects in and out of sealed containers.John Hasted. (1981). The Metal-Benders. Routledge & Kegan Paul. North was tested in Grenoble on 19 December 1977 in scientific conditions and the results were negative.Marcel Blanc. (1978). \\"Fading Spoon Bender\\". New Scientist. p. 431. According to James Randi, during a test at Birkbeck College North was observed to have bent a metal sample with his bare hands. Randi wrote \\"I find it unfortunate that [Hasted] never had an epiphany in which he was able to recognize just how thoughtless, cruel, and predatory were the acts perpetrated on him by fakers who took advantage of his naivety and trust.\\"James Randi. (1982). Chapter Off the Deep End in Flim-Flam! Psychics, ESP, Unicorns, and Other Delusions. Prometheus Books. The physicist John Taylor gave The Metal Benders (1981) a negative review. According to Taylor the metal bending tests had poor controls and Hasted was not in the same room as the subjects for some of the tests. Taylor wrote that \\"not only are the tests not watertight but the conjectured theory is monumentally silly.\\" Hasted suggested in the book that paranormal effects arise through telepathy from the individual in a parallel universe.John Taylor. (1981). \\"The Metal Benders by John Hasted\\". New Scientist. p. 438.

The Spanish fleet, led by the Duke of Fernandina and the Duke of Maqueda broke the French naval blockade over Tarragona and defeated the French fleet under Henri d'Escoubleau de Sourdis, forcing it to retreat.La Roncière p.82 The city was also besieged by land since April by a Franco-Catalan army commanded by Philippe de La Mothe- Houdancourt. The Spanish success in driving Sourdis out of the area, together with the arrival of a relief force sent by land, forced the Franco-Catalan army to leave the siege, and to retreat to Valls, pursued by the Spanish army. The Spanish victory prevented the fall of Tarragona to the Franco-Catalan allies, for which Cardinal Richelieu deprived Sourdis of his office and replaced him by the young Jean Armand de Maillé-Brézé, his nephew.La Roncière p.83 In spite of his success, the Duke of Fernandina was also dismissed from duty. The Count-Duke of Olivares was dissatisfied because the Duke of Fernandina failed to destroy the French fleet, and imprisoned him. The case was truly unusual: the two admirals, both the victor and the vanquished, had the same bitter reward. However, the ostracism of the French Admiral was final, while the Spanish Admiral was soon restored after the fall of Olivares in 1643, and even became part of the Council of the King of Spain. Background Henri d'Escoubleau de Sourdis, commander of the French fleet. On April 1641, the Catalan rebels and the French troops led by Marshal Philippe de La Mothe-Houdancourt sent to support them, launched an offensive to capture Tarragona, one of the few remaining Catalan towns in Spanish hands.Balaguer p.50 On 29 April, La Mothe was in front of Tarragona with his army, composed by 10,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry, and laid siege to the town.Balaguer p.53 The French Mediterranean fleet, commanded by Henri d'Escoubleau de Sourdis, was deployed to support the land operations, and the French Admiral began a naval blockade of Tarragona.La Roncière p.75 Between 4 and 6 July, 1641, a large Spanish galley fleet led by the Duke of Fernandina attempted to break the French naval blockade over Tarragona. He succeeded at a heavy cost to introduce some relief into Tarragona, but failed to break the blockade. For more details, see Naval Battle of Tarragona (July 1641) In response to the failure, Philip IV of Spain ordered to assemble a second, far bigger force, to force Sourdis to abandon his blockade and introduce soldiers and supplies into the town.Balaguer p.56 The command of this new fleet was entrusted to the Duke of Maqueda, who sailed from Cádiz on 20 July.Duro 83–85 The squadrons of Galicia and Dunkirk, and the galleys of Naples, Sicily and Genoa were gathered at Cartagena. The Duke of Fernandina joined this force with the remains of his fleet, increasing its strength to 30 or 35 galleons and frigates, 29 galleys and 65 transport ships full of supplies. At the dawn of August 20, they reached the waters of the besieged city. Battle of Tarragona The French fleet, composed of 14 galleons, 13 pataches, 17 galleys and 3 fireships, was soon put on line and opened fire on the Spanish fleet. Sourdis' vice-admiral was ahead with 6 ships and 5 galleys, Sourdis followed him with 11 ships and 7 galleys, while 12 ships and 5 galleys closed the formation. Sourdis sailed towards the Point of Salou, attempting to bar the way to Maqueda.La Roncière, p. 80 The Spaniards immediately responded to the fire with their galleons, causing serious damage to the French galleons, and forcing the French fleet to leave the harbor entrance. With the blockade broken, and the French fleet engaged in battle with the Spanish galleons, the Spanish convoy of 65 ships, escorted by some Spanish galleys, entered the port, to the great joy of the defenders. Having achieved the main objective, the Spanish galleys were reorganized and attacked the flank of the French fleet. At the same time, Maqueda fell upon the French vanguard supported by his galleons. In the middle of the action, the ship under admiral Orellana lost its mainsail and had to be relieved by the Testa de Oro. The French galleons Forte and Licorne were put out of action, but Sourdis did not lost a single ship. Having managed to hold off a superior fleet, he ordered the withdrawal on 25 August. But although he had saved his whole fleet, the Spaniards had obtained the naval control of the area. The siege of Tarragona was lifted, and the Spanish fleet was able to provision the towns of Roses, Perpignan and Collioure. Consequences Cardinal Richelieu by Robert Nanteuil. In France, the powerful minister of Louis XIII, Cardinal Richelieu, angered by the defeat, deprived Sourdis of his office and replaced him by the young naval officer Jean Armand de Maillé- Brézé. In Spain, in spite of his success, also Don García de Toledo, Duke of Fernandina, was deprived of his charge. The Count-Duke of Olivares felt dissatisfied because Fernandina did not destroyed the French fleet, and imprisoned him. The case was truly unusual: the two admirals, both the victor and the vanquished, had the same bitter reward. However, the ostracism of the French Admiral was final, while the Spanish Admiral was soon restored after the fall of Olivares in 1643, back in charge, and even became part of the Council of the King of Spain. Regarding to Sourdis disgrace, the Spanish admiral Gianettino Doria said that \\"Would to Heaven that I had made a similar retreat, my fortune would be made forever\\".Tilley, p. 217 He was impressed by how Sourdis had fought off a fleet four time superior in numbers and had retired without the loss of a single vessel. But the war continued, and the following year, a new Spanish fleet organized at Cádiz to relieve the isolated garrisons of Roses and Collioure was prevented to do so by Jean Armand de Maillé-Brézé in the Battle of Barcelona (1642), which sealed the loss of Perpignan to France shortly afterwards.La Roncière, p. 92 NotesReferences * Balaguer, Víctor.

January 1629 until his death. Biography He was born at the Castle of Issogne into the noble family of the Madruzzo, various members of which were also prince-bishops of Trento. In his youth he studied grammar and rhetorics in Munich and philosophy at Ingolstadt in Jesuit schools. Later he moved to Perugia where he studied law. In 1619 he was called back to Trento, where his uncle, Cardinal Carlo Gaudenzio Madruzzo, had chosen him as his assistant and successor as prince-bishop. In 1626 he took the vows. After obtaining the throne in Trento, he had to face a period of crisis caused by the Thirty Years' War and by the tense relations between the Holy Roman Emperor and the Papacy. During his rule he was able to obtain a wider degree of freedom from the House of Habsburg. In 1631 he ominously fled the city, which had been struck by plague; Madruzzo attracted further criticism for his relationship with a noblewoman, Claudia Particella. He repeatedly asked for a papal dispensation in order to be able her to marry her. He died suddenly at Trento in December 1658.

It is a large brick building erected in the late 19th century that serves as offices not just of Pitkin County's courts but its other governmental agencies, and the Aspen police. A landmark of the city, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Like many courthouses, it has a statue of Lady Justice in the front. Unlike many of the other such statues, she is depicted without a blindfold. In the late 20th and 21st centuries, as Aspen became a popular destination for wealthy and famous people, the courthouse has seen several high-profile defendants and litigants, from Ted Bundy to Charlie Sheen. Building The courthouse is located on the north side of the block of East Main between Galena and Hunter streets, closer to the former on the west. Across the street is an open area around St. Mary's Catholic Church. A mix of commercial and residential properties and the Pitkin County Library are to the northwest and a small housing development lies to the east. is to the southeast on South Hunter. Two blocks west is another Aspen landmark, the Hotel Jerome. Aspen City Hall is a block away at South Galena and East Hopkins. The terrain slopes slightly toward the Roaring Fork River to the north. The building itself is a two-story brick structure on a stone foundation, raised to expose the basement. It is set back from the street, fronted by a low iron fence, red cobblestone sidewalk, and small trees and shrubbery. Two large evergreens flank the courthouse. A large modern extension containing the jail is located to the rear. On the 13-bay south (front) facade, the five-bay projecting entrance pavilion, itself with the center three bays projecting, is complemented by two lesser projections on the third and fourth bays from the center. Bricks are laid in stretcher bond. Stone belt courses provide sills and lintels the narrow one-over-one double-hung sash windows on the first story. Segmental arches of vertical brick, with keystones, spring from the lintels on the flanking projections. The second-story windows are similarly treated but less restrained. All have segmental arches; the central window of the center pavilion, and the windows on the flanking ones, are combined under one larger arch with their transoms divided by the brick. Above them is a wide plain wooden frieze topped by a dentilled cornice at the roofline. A pediment with doubled semicircular window and the same cornice treatment tops the middle three bays. Atop the other projecting sections are small solid wooden parapets with recessed panels alternating with fluting. The shallow hipped roof is pierced by two chimneys in the middle and a tall tower behind the front pavilion. The lowest of the tower's four stages is a plain wooden section, topped with a cornice. The next two are united by a small pair of windows similar to those in the building, above a recessed panel and topped with a fanlight and pediment. On the second stage they are flanked by two wooden fluted pilasters; on the third by paneling and a spiral carving. The topmost stage is a peaked shingled roof with imitation miniature shed dormer windows. At the entrance, stone steps rise up to a small, steeply gabled entrance projection faced in rough stone blocks. On the top is a silvery zinc statue of Lady Justice, without the blindfold common to many other depictions of her. Large wooden paneled double doors topped by an arched fanlight provide entrance. History=Construction In the 1880s, Aspen went from an isolated mining camp on the far side of the Continental Divide to a city of over 10,000 people as a result of the Colorado Silver Boom. Pitkin County, named for then-Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin, was established in 1881. A small courthouse had been established at Cooper and Mill streets, but within ten years a larger one was needed. The county acquired five lots in May 1890 for a new building. Great controversy surrounded the construction. There were accusations of corruption and favoritism. The county commissioners ignored calls to stop the project and went ahead with a design by Denver architect William Quayle. It was completed and opened early in 1891. The six-foot (2 m) statue of Lady Justice, one of the few in the United States showing her without the usual blindfold, was made of pressed stamped zinc in Salem, Ohio, for a cost of $250 ($ in contemporary dollars). The statue's painted silvery exterior reflects the silver mining that was the root of Aspen's prosperity at that time. Why the blindfold was omitted is not known for certain. It has been humorously suggested that the commissioners, given the corruption allegations, decided Justice should be able to keep an eye on what was going on around her. Another account has it that the miners, who had previously set up their own informal courts to resolve disputes over claims, were reluctant to cede that authority, even to a legitimate governmental body. They therefore paid for the statue themselves and insisted that she be shown without the blindfold but with scales (weight being an impartial measure of mining success), to emphasize that in Aspen justice could be impartial without artificial restraints.Resnik, 91–93. Ground was broken in July 1890, and the new courthouse was finished and opened in January 1891. It was celebrated as a major civic accomplishment. Newspapers ran long, laudatory articles; many politicians gave speeches at the dedication ceremony, and a fireman's ball was held that night. Later years When Aspen's population declined after 1893 and the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, the courthouse remained functioning as the seat of government. It continued to be used and maintained as the city slipped into its \\"quiet years\\", of the early 20th century and its population dropped to less than a thousand. As skiing revived the city following World War II, it would play a role in the cultural changes Aspen underwent in the latter half of the century. In 1961 Hunter S. Thompson, considered the founder of gonzo journalism but then unknown, came to Aspen with $2 and decided to stay, eventually settling in nearby Woody Creek. He later became famous writing articles such as \\"The Battle of Aspen\\" for Rolling Stone about the hippies and other countercultures of the era drawn to Aspen by its natural setting and their indulgence in sex and recreational drug use. In 1970 he ran unsuccessfully for county sheriff, catalyzing a growing conflict between the newer and older, more conservative residents. As part of his platform he promised to \\"install, on the courthouse lawn, a bastinado platform and set of stocks—in order to punish dishonest dope dealers in a proper public fashion.\\" Two events at the courthouse in 1977 gained national attention. The previous year singer Claudine Longet had been arrested and charged with murder after fatally shooting her boyfriend, skier Spider Sabich. She claimed it had been an accident. Her trial at the courthouse in early 1977 garnered international media attention, particularly because of the presence at the trial of celebrities who had begun making Aspen a second home. One, Jack Nicholson, a friend of Longet's, sat prominently behind the defense table in the courtroom every day of the trial. She was ultimately found guilty of a misdemeanor charge of negligent homicide, and spent three weeks in jail. Many longtime residents, in addition to believing Longet had been punished too lightly, came to consider the attention drawn to Aspen by the trial, and Nicholson's presence in particular, as the beginning of Aspen's conversion from a plain, unpretentious ski town to glamorous Hollywood satellite community. Another 1976 homicide in the area put the courthouse in the national spotlight again later in 1977. On June 7, serial killer Ted Bundy, already serving a state prison sentence in Utah for kidnapping, was taken to Aspen to be tried for the murder of Caryn Campbell outside Snowmass the previous year. A onetime law student, he had chosen to represent himself, and thus was not shackled or handcuffed. During a recess in the proceedings, he went to the courthouse's law library on the second floor, ostensibly to review a map of the area prosecutors had introduced as evidence against him. As soon as he was alone he jumped out the window, above the ground, and fled into the mountains and wilderness around the city. His attempt to reach Crested Butte to the south failed, and he was recaptured in Aspen a week later. Thirteen years later, another trial drew national attention. This time Thompson, who had once attempted to make the courthouse his workplace in his bid for sheriff, came to it as a defendant. Prosecutors had searched his Woody Creek home after porn-film director Gail Palmer told them he had grabbed her by the breasts after she refused to join him in a hot-tub party; they found drugs and some explosive devices. Thompson was charged with five felonies. During the months leading to the trial, Thompson's fans and supporters demonstrated outside the courthouse; late in 1990 the charges were dismissed over concerns the evidence against the journalist had been obtained through an unconstitutional search. By 2010 the courthouse had been remodeled and upgraded. It still lacked the capacity to accommodate large crowds. In 2009 actor Charlie Sheen was charged with several felonies after allegedly holding a knife to the throat of wife Brooke Mueller on Christmas Day in their rented Aspen home. In advance of his appearances at the courthouse in summer of that year, where he eventually pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, the city and county imposed limitations on access to the courthouse and media presence in the courtroom. Judge James Boyd issued a Decorum Order limiting attendance at the hearings to the courtroom's legal capacity of 60.

During the Golden age of radio, there was a decline in newspaper revenues. Radio began advertising, and advertisers began to give their business to radio, because it was a new, exciting, and creative way to communicate with their customers. Thus, newspapers were not happy about the new trend in radio advertising, due to the depression and the fact that advertisers wanted to convert to this new medium. Newspapers were also distressed with the fact that radio was able to report breaking news faster, and with more animation. Newspapers could no longer publicize breaking news, because the people already knew. The first radio broadcast on KDKA had been the news of the election returns on November 2, 1920. KDKA came on-air at 8:00 PM, and the election returns were phoned in to the studio from the Pittsburgh Post. Almost immediately, the newspapers regretted their collaboration with the radio station. The press associations including the Associated Press and the United Press, which depended on the newspapers for their main sources of news and income, were pressured to discontinue providing news to radio stations. Radio stations fought this decision in 1933, and came to an agreement where they were able to briefly allow the press associations to continue providing news. They then developed the Biltmore Agreement, in December 1933, where broadcasters agreed to aggressively restrict their broadcasting of news in return for the newspapers continuance of their publication of radio listings. Radio stations agreed to broadcast no longer than five minutes of news, twice per day, while using information supplied by the newspapers. They also agreed to have no sponsors, and have no single story containing more than 30 words. Stations were also forced to include the announcement: \\"See your daily newspaper for further details.\\" Among other things, stations could only broadcast news after 9:30 AM for morning news, and after 9:00 PM for evening news, ensuring that people were likely to already have received their morning and evening newspapers. This, however, did not end the feud between newspapers and radio. Local newspapers began feuds with local radio stations. Newspapers also refused to publish anything positive about local radio stations, including information concerning programs that the stations aired, or provide any kind of advertising for their station. Newspapers also reported news, suggesting that newspapers were a better news and advertising medium than radio. Many believe that radio gave into this agreement because they feared the power of the newspapers. People understood that this agreement was excessive and unfair to broadcasters. Meanwhile, others valued the Biltmore Agreement for resolving “the troublesome, wasteful and ramifying antagonism between the news press and radio broadcasting.” The agreement broke down within a couple of years, as newspapers discovered how profitable owning radio stations could be.

He was the basis for the character of Bruce Niles in Larry Kramer's The Normal Heart, which was one of the first plays to address the HIV/AIDS crisis. Life and career Popham was born in Emmett, Idaho, and graduated from Portland State College, Oregon. He was a Vietnam War veteran who was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for valor in 1966, serving as a first lieutenant in the Fifth Air Cavalry. He retired in 1969 as a Special Forces major in the United States Army Reserve. After his time in the army, Popham worked as a banker on Wall Street for the Irving Trust Company, leaving as a vice president in 1980. Thereafter, he joined McGraw-Hill Inc. as a general manager. Popham didn't become politically active until reading a newspaper article in 1981 about the disease that became known as AIDS. Richard D. Dunne, president of the Gay Men's Health Crisis at the time of Popham's death said: \\"His history had been quite the opposite from a gay activist. It was only an issue like AIDS that galvanized people like Paul.\\" Popham was diagnosed with AIDS in February 1985 and remained active with GMHC until his illness became too severe. He was survived by his mother, brother, two sisters and his longtime partner Richard DuLong.  The Normal Heart  Larry Kramer, who later left GMHC to found ACT UP, frequently fought with Popham. Kramer wrote in Reports from the Holocaust that, as a result, when writing the roman à clef play The Normal Heart, Kramer made the protagonist Ned Weeks (the cypher for himself) be obnoxious and Bruce Niles (the cypher for Popham) be a clearly sympathetic leader, by way of contrition. Bruce Niles was portrayed by David Allen Brooks (The Public Theatre, 1985), Andrzej Szczytko (Polish Theatre in Poznań, 1987; Polish Television Theatre, 1989), Lee Pace (Golden Theatre, 2011) and Taylor Kitsch (HBO television film, 2014).

(JBANC) is a non-profit organization that monitors issues affecting Baltic-American communities in the United States and the nations of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. JBANC functions as the public affairs bureau for its three parent organizations, the Estonian American National Council (EANC), the American Latvian Association, Inc. American Latvian Association, Inc http://www.alausa.org/lv/ , and the Lithuanian American Council, Inc. (LAC) . The organization was founded on April 27, 1961 through a joint proclamation by Estonian National Committee in the U.S.A. Chairman Julius Kangur; American Latvian Association, Inc., in the United States President Peter P. Lejins; and Lithuanian American Council, Inc., President Leonard Simutis. History Since its inception, JBANC has worked with members of Congress, the White House, the State Department, and other federal agencies to promote the Baltic-American agenda. The group focuses heavily on fostering democratic principles, promoting human rights worldwide, supporting the establishment of peaceful relations among nations, and seeking the restoration and maintenance of security throughout Central and Eastern Europe. During the late twentieth century, JBANC worked to secure admission for the Baltic countries into NATO and the European Union. When Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania all became full members of both organizations in 2004, JBANC turned its efforts to a host of issues that continue to demand attention today. Estonian World Review: New Priorities Develop Following NATO Enlargement. These include bearing witness to the legacy of communism; defending the Baltic nations against unjust accusations and historical revisionism; promoting democracy beyond the Baltics; strengthening transatlantic integration and American engagement in the Baltics; and expanding relations with other ethnic organizations and NGOs in the U.S. and abroad. Estonian World: The Ironclad Leadership of the US in the NATO Is Critically Important After the Russian belligerence against Ukraine demonstrated Russia’s strategic threat to the United States and Europe, particularly to Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, the focus of the group shifted back to securing peace in the Baltics. JBANC advocates for the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) that enables the U.S. and NATO allies to be better prepared for contingencies that may occur during Russia’s widening aggression against its neighbors. Also, JBANC draws attention to the hybrid warfare in Ukraine and Russia’s continued occupation of Crimea and territories in Georgia, JBANC Condemns Russian Aggression Against Georgia and the continuous provocations against the Baltic countries, including the kidnapping of an Estonian intelligence officer, dangerous aerial and maritime incursions around the Baltic Sea, and its ceaseless campaigns of disinformation. The organization hosted a conference, in Washington, D.C. on April 16–18, 2015, which focused on the theme: \\"History Repeated: Baltics and Eastern Europe in Peril?\\". Speakers at the event included President of Estonia Toomas Hendrik Ilves, former Lithuanian Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius, European parliamentarian Artis Pabriks, along with Ambassador John Heffern, James Kirchick, Liz Wahl, Paul Goble, Paul Joyal, David Kramer, Luke y, and others.

The Early Days  Goodnight And I Wish* was formed in early 2007, and began life as an aid to help cure bouts of insomnia, suffered by Brandon, which is where the self invented genre description, Lullaby Pop was created. The name Goodnight And I Wish, is the title of an Altered Images album track, from the Pinky Blue album. Altered Images, were a big influence on Brandon at the time, as well as his other favourite bands such as The Cure, Aztec Camera, Syd Barret, The Coral, and 1960's psychedelic band July. Initially a solo project, early works were first uploaded to Myspace and received much attention from the worldwide fan base of Neils Children. Early shows included regular slots at London's most popular band nights, The Sect and Dice Club.  Releases  Brandon Jacobs released his debut solo E.P, ‘Dreams…Wishes & Fairy Tales’, on 5 May 2008. It was released on CD with 100 individually hand drawn and numbered sleeves on his own record label, Modern Pop Records. A full page write up was featured in the May edition of Artrocker Magazine, as well as an opening support slot for The Long Blondes at the Kentish Town Forum, having been asked to play by long-term friend, guitarist Dorian Cox. \\"So Much For The British Summertime\\" was a free digital release, only available to download from the first day of the summer solstice 2008 through to winter solstice 2008. A promotional video was also shot by Emmaalouise Smith in various locations including Brighton beach and Brandon's back garden in Cheshunt. On 2 February 2009, Goodnight And I Wish* self-released the download only single, 'If Tim Burton Wanted To', in time for Valentine's Day. Also with Brandon's own artwork, featuring two \\"Burton-esque\\" characters standing side by side, representing himself and long-term girlfriend, Emmaalouise Smith. Lyrically, the song is about the strange imaginary world that Brandon has created as a solo artist. The song features an earlier character from the song \\"My Pet Spider\\" as well as a haunted house, backed up by the line: \\"If Tim Burton wanted to, he could make a film about me and you....\\". Brandon also shot his own music video for the release, and released it via iTunes. On 20 July 2009, debut album, \\"A Ruffled Mind Makes A Restless Pillow\\" was released. The title was a quote made famous by English novelist and poet Charlotte Brontë. This time, Brandon licensed the album out to Japanese independent record label, Vinyl Junkies. The UK release saw the 12 tracks split into two formats via mini 8-cm CD's, named \\"Sun\\" & \\"Moon\\", placed in black velvet bags. The album was to be a contrast between night and day, combining light hearted love songs, poems and Tea, put against fear, ghosts, witches and darker adaptations of the classic film \\"Freaks\\". The album release was celebrated with a release party at East London bar Cocomo, where Goodnight And I Wish* performed two contrasting sets, playing the album in its entirety. The Japanese release features three extra bonus tracks: 'Haly Horror', 'British Summertime' and 'Where Shall We Meet In Our Dreams?'. In 2010, after almost a year writing and recording, Goodnight And I Wish* released the single \\"Future Plans\\" on 22 November. It was an 'AA' single, alongside \\"Our Little Day Out\\". The single was released on limited edition vinyl and as a digital download on London based independent record label 'Tape'. So far in 2011, Brandon has been regularly uploading new demos onto YouTube, which he has stated as being early works for forthcoming E.P and album releases. = Members = Brandon Jacobs was joined by Thomas Warren on bass guitar in 2009. Thomas had been bassist in Southend band Wretched Replica, and was also a roadie for Neils Children. When asked to perform at the 2009 Offset festival, the line up also included one-off member, Sarah McIntosh of The Good Natured as a backing vocalist and keyboard player. A more permanent member was then instated in the form off Kelly Thomas on keys, percussion and backing vocals. Then, guitarist David Strange, ex-Strange Idols guitarist added to the equation. Following this, in 2010, the line up was completed in the form of drummer Renu, but due to her own solo commitments, played her last show at the band's single launch for 'Future Plans' on Thursday 25 November 2010. In January 2011, Brandon asked fellow Neils Children member John Linger to fill in as drummer for Goodnight And I Wish*. John has since become a full-time member.

Once functioning as Tappan's general store, it has been occupied since 1985 by chiropractor Lawrence Forgacs' Tappan Professional Center. The Burton Store is one of two buildings in the district constructed in the Colonial Revival style, the other being the nearby Borcher's Stable, located at 2 Oak Tree Road just beyond The Old 76 House. This was the last building phase during the period of significance in the early twentieth century as recognized by the Tappan Historic District. It is located adjacent to The Old 76 House and across the street from The Manse Barn. The Burton Store is described by Alicia A. Jettner in the National Register of Historic Places as follows: \\"This is a large one-story flat-roofed building with narrow clapboard siding and details in the Colonial Revival mode. Glazed double doors are flanked by large transom and side lights. On both sides of the entrance are paired store windows with panels below. The dropped cornice has a denticulated frieze with triglyphs similar to those of the mid-1830 buildings in the district. It was originally called \\"The Apartment House\\" and stood approximately one block west of its present location. It was moved in the early 1920s and became the grocery store of Burton & Sons. It had restoration work done in 1982-1983. There is a large, contributing one story clapboard-sided shed, which stands to the south of this building. It is almost the same length as the Burton Store and one room deep. This building appears to date to an earlier period than the Burton Store and was probably on the property prior to the move of the store to this lot.\\" See also (photograph on page 11/33): See also *Reformed Church of Tappan *Tappan Historic District *The Old 76 House ReferencesExternal links * http://www.livingplaces.com/NY/Rockland_County/Orangetown_Town/Tappan_Historic_District.html Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1914 Category:Colonial Revival architecture in New York (state) Category:Buildings and structures in Rockland County, New York Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:Historic district contributing properties in New York (state) Category:National Register of Historic Places in Rockland County, New York ","title":"Burton Store"},{"id":"31602636","text":"Albert Gallatin is a bronze statue by James Earle Fraser.\\"Albert Gallatin, (sculpture)\\".

The site was sold to Puma Energy in 2015 for use as a petroleum storage and distribution terminal. History Milford Haven Refinery is situated on a 1200-acre site near Milford Haven. The refinery came on stream in 1973 under Amoco's ownership. A major upgrade was carried out in 1981, and a catalytic cracker was added. In the same year (1981) Murco (a subsidiary of Murphy Oil) purchased a 30% share of the refinery. Since then further units have been added, notably a naptha isomerisation unit and a hydrodesulphurisation unit. In August 1983, a major boilover fire required 150 firemen, 50 fire engines and two days to extinguish.Amoco Refinery Fire 1983 www.fireservice.co.uk, accessed 07.04.16Boilover of a crude oil tank ARIA Article 6077, French Ministry of Environment, accessed 07.04.16 Elf bought Amoco's interest in 1990 and Elf was acquired by Total in 2000. In December 2007 Murco purchased Total's 70% interest in the refinery to become the 100% owner. In 2010 Murco expressed a desire to sell the refinery. In April 2014 the company warned that it may have to close the site, and began a consultation process with staff.

In March 2015 the site was acquired by Puma Energy, along with three English inland terminals at Westerleigh, Theale and Bedworth. Puma Energy said it would convert the site into a petroleum storage and distribution terminal. At 0900 BST Sunday 21 July 2019 the two large stacks were demolished via controlled explosion. Production At its close the refinery had an annual processing capacity of 5.5 million tonnes (108,000 barrels per day). The refinery imported all its feedstocks from the nearby marine terminal, to which the refinery was linked by mainly underground pipeline. Refined products were distributed by road, rail, sea and pipeline to the Midlands and Manchester. 1983 fire In August, 1983, an accidental fire occurred at the facility's number 11 crude storage tank. Filled with more than 46,000 tonnes of oil, the flaming storage tank experienced multiple boil overs, spreading the fire nearly four acres. In all, 150 firefighters and 70 fire appliances were needed to tackle the blaze.

It is a parasitoid of the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, family Buprestidae), an invasive species which has destroyed tens of millions of ash trees in its introduced range in North America. As part of the campaign against the emerald ash borer (EAB), American scientists in conjunction with the Chinese Academy of Forestry searched since 2003 for its natural enemies in the wild leading to the discovery of several parasitoid wasps, including Tetrastichus planipennisi which is a gregarious endoparasitoid of EAB larvae on Manchurian Ash (Fraxinus mandschurica) and has been recorded to attack and kill up to 50 percent of EAB larvae. Life cycle Tetrastichus planipennisi parasitize EAB larvae by drilling through the bark and laying eggs on its host. The hatching parasitoid larvae feed and develop on the EAB larva, resulting in its death. Tetrastichus completes at least four generations each year and one EAB larva can produce up to 127 Tetrastichus adults. Tetrastichus planipennisi survive the winter as larvae inside their host or host gallery under the bark of ash trees. Biological control Tetrastichus planipennisi, a gregarious larval endoparasitoid, has been introduced and released into the United States of America as a possible biological control of the EAB along with two other wasps, Oobius agrili, a solitary, parthenogenic egg parasitoid, and Spathius agrili, a gregarious larval ectoparasitoid. However of the three, Tetrastichus planipennisi has showed best results in affecting EAB and establishing surviving populations. Research on the viability of as an effective biocontrol agent is ongoing in the US and Canada. Laboratory methods have been developed for continuous rearing of this and other species of EAB parasitoid wasps. Extensive studies on the specificity of these parasitoids on native beetles and other insects has revealed that in laboratory no-choice assays, Tetrastichus attacked only actively feeding EAB larvae in ash branches and rejected all non-EAB species as hosts.

As an actor, he was known for the nearly 100 films he was in during the silent era. As a director, he was a co-director of the 1932 film Scarface. Career Rosson's first directorial effort was the 1926 American black and white silent comedy film Fine Manners, initially directed by Lewis Milestone for Famous Players-Lasky/Paramount Pictures. After an argument with actress Gloria Swanson, Milestone walked off the set, leaving the film to be completed by Rosson, who had picked up directorial tricks while working as an assistant director to Allan Dwan. The success of the film, being Rosson's first directorial effort since he co-directed Her Father's Keeper in 1917 with his brother Arthur Rosson, won him a long-term contract with Famous Players-Lasky. Personal life Rosson was the younger brother of director Arthur Rosson, his younger sister Helene became a movie actress, and his younger brother Harold became a well known director of photography who won the first Academy Award for color cinematography. Richard Rosson died from suicide from carbon monoxide poisoning at his home in Pacific Palisades, California at the age of 60. A year later, Rosson's wife, Vera Sisson, committed suicide by barbiturate overdose. On May 1, 1939, Rosson was arrested on a charge of espionage in Vienna, Austria, with his wife and two other British nationals, by the Gestapo, allegedly for filming military hardware.

He participated in a daring raid behind enemy lines on the Western and Atlantic Railroad, known famously as the Great Locomotive Chase. The mission failed and Campbell and seven fellow raiders were executed by the Confederates on the charge of spying.Russell S. Bonds. Stealing the General: The Great Locomotive Chase and the First Medal of Honor, Westholme Publishing, 2006. William Hunter Campbell was born in Fox Township, Carroll County, Ohio to Samuel and Sarah Hunter Campbell.andrewsraid.com (William Hunter Campbell) Howe says in Historical Collections of Ohio that his mother was named Jane Morgan, a cousin of Confederate General John Hunt Morgan. Campbell was visiting friends with 2nd Ohio Infantry in Kentucky in 1862 when he was recruited to participate in a raid to steal a Confederate locomotive and bring it to Federal lines. James J. Andrews, also a civilian, recruited Campbell and 22 soldiers from three Ohio regiments, the 2nd, 21st and 33rd Ohio Infantry. Another participant described Campbell : \\"He was a man of two hundred twenty pounds, handsome as Apollo, and of immense physical strength, which he was slow to use when roused, though good-natured and clever in the main.\\" The raiders were to sneak south in civilian clothing and rendezvous in Marietta, Georgia. All but two made it and boarded a train pulled by the locomotive General on April 12, 1862. The train traveled north and stopped in Big Shanty, Georgia for breakfast, and the raiders stole the General and a few cars, intending to tear up track and burn bridges behind them and meet advancing Federal troops.\\"The Great Locomotive Chase\\" by Harper Harris After a chase described in Great Locomotive Chase, the raiders ran out of fuel near Chattanooga, Tennessee, and were captured. As a civilian, Campbell was tried and convicted of being an unlawful combatant. He was hanged with six others June 18, 1862 at the corner of Fair Street (now Memorial Drive) and South Park Avenue, Atlanta, Georgia. His hanging was described : \\"Five only remained dangling in the air; for two of the seven, Campbell and Slavens, being very heavy men, broke the ropes, and fell to the ground insensible. In a short time they recovered, and asked for a drink of water, which was given them. Then they requested an hour to pray before entering the future world, which lay so near and dark before them. This last petition was indignantly refused, and as soon as the ropes could be adjusted, they were compelled to re-ascend the scaffold, and were again turned off!\\"Pittinger 1863 : pp. 189-190 Campbell was buried nearby, and his remains were removed April 25, 1866 to Chattanooga National Cemetery, near the Ohio Memorial, (Section G, grave No. 11,180).

Personal decoration was limited to a single blue stone with a thin central perforation and two incisions measuring 6mm long. Flints found were in light beige, dark beige, honey, dark gray and translucent gray with a good state of preservation. Patina alterations and desilication were evident. Arrowheads found were matched with Amuq points and Byblos points. Agriculture and animal husbandry Many animal remains were found, especially mammals, noted by the presence of teeth and antlers. Turtles and likely birds were also found to be sources of food. Several sediment samples were sieved and floated to collect possible remnants of micro and macro- remains of vegetation. Along with charcoal from the site, this has been preserved for analysis. The tell showed numerous materials similar to those of Byblos and highlights the total absence of material dating after the middle of the neolithic. Well built permanent structures suggest land tenure and conservation.

The organization absorbed Declare Yourself and the Student Association for Voter Empowerment, and began operations as a 501(c)(3) in March 2011. The organization says that its positions are based upon its assessment of majority views of the millennial generation.  History  Declare Yourself began during the 2004 presidential elections to encourage young people to register to vote. It began as the \\"Declaration of Independence Road Trip\\", a 50-city cross-country tour of a rare Dunlap broadside of the Declaration of Independence lasting three-and-a- half years. Up to its merger with the Student Association for Voter Empowerment, Declare Yourself registered almost 4 million young people to vote using online tools, on-location efforts, and an Ultimate College Bowl contests. Founded in 2006, the Student Association for Voter Empowerment was an association of students that worked to bring young Americans into the political process by breaking down barriers to electoral participation and encouraging youth-led policy solutions. The organization's initiatives included attempted Congressional passage of the Student Voter Act and 80 Million Strong for Young American Jobs - a coalition of youth groups to address unemployment issues for young people during the Great Recession.  Former campaigns  In April 2011, Our Time released a petition identifying underrepresentation of 18- to 34-year-olds in national opinion polls. The campaign began in response to CNN poll results on social issues that cited the favor/oppose percentages of this age group as \\"N/A.\\" \\"N/A is Not OK\\" generated a response from CNN who mentioned, \\"The data for the 18-to-34 age group is listed as 'N/A' in the breakdown of age groups because the sample size was too small for statistically valid analysis.\\" Our Time responded by recommending that the polling industry innovate and adopt new technologies to reach younger Americans. To address the high youth unemployment rate, Our Time called on the media to focus more attention on the issue, pointing out that the economic issues surrounding the 2011 riots in the Middle East were not dissimilar from the problems facing American youth. Buy Young offered exclusive deals from companies founded by Americans under 35. The campaign encouraged Americans to purchase products from young companies and support youth job creation. OUR TIME used profits from its Buy Young campaign to fund non-partisan voter registration and consumer education activities. On July 13, 2011 Our Time convened more than 125 young CEOs and executives in Washington, D.C. at the White House, the Chamber of Commerce and Capitol Hill to launch the campaign and push for greater job creation and economic opportunities for young Americans. News About You provided, five days a week, headlines about the economy, education, politics, employment, as well as a lifestyles and comedy section.  Current campaigns  Our Time's biggest ongoing campaigns include voter registration, voting reform, and getting money out of politics. Using social media and their online voter registration tool, the organization hopes to engage and register record numbers of young voters for the 2014 election. Our Time has testified to Congress on the importance of voting reforms. They also released a report in November of 2013 with the Advancement Project on the obstacles faced by millennials and young voters of color at the polls. They use social media such as shareable petitions and videos to raise awareness about this issue among young voters. Our Time frequently reaches out to millennials on social media on the issue of money in politics as well, using petitions, memes, and news summaries. They were one of the many groups that signed the amicus brief in support of the appellee in the recent McCutcheon et al. v. FEC Supreme Court case.

The area is on the Iveragh peninsula, the largest peninsula in southwestern Ireland. The parish is home to Rossbeigh Beach, Coomasahran Lake, a number of rock art sites, the natterjack toad and the Kerry bog pony. Owing to its natural heritage, history and its location on the Ring of Kerry, Glenbeigh is a tourist destination. Glenbeigh is surrounded by a horseshoe of hills and the Seefin Mountains. The Caragh and Behy rivers flow at either side of the village into Castlemaine Harbour. Name The Irish name Gleann Beithe is from gleann \\"glen, valley\\" and Beithe, related to the Behy River (Irish An Bheithe) and the birch tree (beith). The anglicisation \\"Glanbehy\\" is the official spelling for the civil parish, whereas Glenbeigh is the spelling for the village where the N70 road meets the Behy River. History A number of Fianna legends centre around Glenbeigh. These legends suggest that Diarmuid and Grainne spent some days hiding in a cave in the valley of the Behy. Nearby Rossbeigh is known for being the place where Oisin and Niamh took to the sea on their white horse to live in Tír na nÓg (the land of youth). Near the village is the ruin of \\"Wynne's Folly\\" or \\"Glenbeigh Towers\\". This mansion was built by Lord Headley Wynne in 1867. The barbarity and brutality of Mr Roe, the agent for Lord Wynne during the evictions, were said to be far in excess of the worst actions of his master. Gladstone's Land Act of 1881, which in effect said that tenants should no longer be removed at will, did little for the residents of the Wynn Estate, as during the years of 1882 and 1883 there were numerous evictions. These evictions arose because the tenants could not afford the rent increases applied to cover the cost of construction of the castle. Not very long after this Wynn drifted into insolvency and left Glenbeigh. During World War I, the castle and grounds were let to the British military for use as a training centre for reservists. In 1921, Republican forces burned down the castle and it was never rebuilt. Nearby Rossbeigh Strand is a popular sandy beach which lies under Curra Hill. A tower at the north end of the sandhills was used once as a guide mark for ships entering Castlemaine Harbour. Badly damaged in a storm in February 2011, some of the tower’s stones were salvaged and used to build a replica on Glenbeigh’s main street. Built heritage The Towers Hotel, Glenbeigh Ruins of Glenbeigh tower folly (also known as Wynn's Castle, Wynne's Folly, Headley Towers or Glenbeigh Towers Castle) There are six structures included in the Record of Protected Structures: :- Glenbeigh Tower Duchas ref: 21306301 :- Church of Ireland Duchas ref: 21306302 :- The Towers Hotel Duchas ref: 21306303 :- St. James Catholic Church Duchas ref: 21306304 :- Glenbeigh Hotel Duchas ref: 21306305 :- Cottage RPS ref: 063-001 The following structures are considered to be of sufficient architectural and heritage value to be considered for inclusion in the Record of Protected Structures: :- One cottage in a terrace of three houses to the north of Main Street. :- The Behy Bridge Geography Glenbeigh is close to Rossbeigh beach and mudflats, and has views across the bay to Seefin Mountain. The River Behy traverses the western village boundary, meeting Rossbeigh Creek and Lake Carragh to the north and, to the south, the lakes of Coomaglaslan and Coomasaharn. There are two candidate Special Areas of Conservation in the area. Facilities Glenbeigh functions as a local service centre for its catchment area and as a centre of tourism, being close to Rossbeigh beach and standing at an intersection of the Kerry Way walking trail and the Ring of Kerry. The village has a church, community centre and garda station. The adjacent blue flag beach and walking routes provide outdoor recreational amenities. There are a number of small hotels, bed and breakfast accommodation and holiday homes.

It is made up of two interconnected buildings sited on the north and south sides of East Third Street. The Adler Theatre is connected to the original section of the convention center on the north side of the complex. History Planning for the RiverCenter began in the late 1970s. The working name for the facility was the “Community Activity Center,\\" also known as “Superblock.” The facility was built in the early 1980s and opened in 1983. It was designed in a modern, open industrial look. The original building connected the Adler Theatre on the west and the Blackhawk Hotel on the east. Together they formed a convention and entertainment complex for the Quad City area. The facility offered of space in a large hall and six breakout rooms. An atrium was built over what was Perry Street. Minimalist artist Sol LeWitt was commissioned to provide artwork for the RiverCenter. He created Tower 1984 and two wall drawings. They were Davenport's first public art project. The tower, which was designed for a plaza that was never built, was moved to the plaza in front of the Figge Art Museum in October 2004 and one of the wall drawings was moved to the museum at a later date. A feasibility study was conducted and it was determined that the RiverCenter could be expanded. In the fall of 1993 the expansion opened on the south side of East Third Street, across the street from the Blackhawk Hotel. It was also designed in a modern industrial look and added to the facility. A second atrium covered Perry Street, another large hall, four break out rooms and an executive board room were added. A skywalk above East Third Street connected the two sections of the facility. Kaiserslautern Square Park, named for one of Davenport's sister cities, was built to the west of the new building. The expansion of the RiverCenter was paid for in part by contributions from Riverboat Gambling, which came to the area in 1991. The Perry Park Green Space was completed on the south side of the building along East Second Street in 2002 The convention center and the theater are owned by the city of Davenport and they have been operated by VenuWorks of Ames, Iowa since 1998. Adler Theatre The Adler Theatre is a 2,400-seat performing arts center. It was opened as the RKO Orpheum on November 25, 1931. The Art Deco style theater was designed by A.S. Graven of Chicago. Henry Dreyfuss of New York City designed the interior. Restoration of the old RKO Orpheum began in 1981. Lee Enterprises made a $1 million contribution for an endowment. The theater was renamed the Adler after newspaper publishers E.P. Adler and his son Philip, both of whom led Lee Enterprises. Renovations, which included increasing the size of the stage, took place in 2005 and 2006. The theater is home to the Quad City Symphony Orchestra and Ballet Quad Cities. It hosts Broadway touring companies and other productions and performances. The theater and the former Hotel Mississippi, which surrounds it, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Hotel Mississippi-RKO Orpheum Theater.

In psychology, gainful employment is a positive psychology concept that explores the benefits of work and employment. Second only to personal relationships, work is the most important determinant of quality of life. Over 7855 articles were published on job satisfaction between the years 1976 and 2000. Positive psychology's emphasis on gainful employment has increased the amount of recent publications on gainful employment and its impact on quality of life and illnesses like depression. Present measurements of employment emphasize decreasing the unemployment, as opposed to increasing gainful employment. Positive psychology argues that gainful employment is a necessary component of living a fulfilled life, noting its positive impact on identity, social support, purpose, and challenge. Components of gainful employment Gainful employment is characterized by the following nine components: 1\\\\. Variety in duties performed - A lack in variability can lead to presenteeism, in which the employee physically goes to work, but becomes unproductive or discontent due to boredom with repetitive work activities. If the tasks at work are varied, satisfaction comes more easily. 2\\\\. Safe working environment - Safe working conditions must be ensured by the organization and its managers. The work setting must also be healthy and supportive, so that employees feel safe in their roles. 3\\\\. Income for family and oneself - Income is necessary to support oneself. However, data does not show that people who earn more money are more gainfully employed than those who earn less. 4\\\\. A purpose derived from providing a product or service - An individual may derive purpose in life from the work that he or she completes. Many individuals describe their work as a calling, or in other words, “a vocation to which the employee brings a passion—a commitment to the work for its own sake”. 5\\\\. Happiness and satisfaction - Enthusiasm and attitude at work. There must be a close match between an individual's activities and his or her knowledge, skills, and attitudes. 6\\\\. Positive engagement and involvement - An individual must have a sufficient amount of work to complete, have the necessary knowledge and resources in order to complete the work, and have the opportunity to perform and grow as a result of that work. Warr reported that the most gainfully employed individuals work in settings where the skills of the employee match the skills required for the assigned tasks. 7\\\\. A sense of performing well and meeting goals - An individual must believe that he or she is capable of performing well at work and exceeding the goals that he or she set. In order to perform well at work, employees should strive to set SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Reasonable, and Timely) goals. 8\\\\. Friendships at work - Positive companionship has been proven to lead to fewer accidents, more engaged customers, increased achievement, increased job satisfaction, and increased productivity. 9\\\\. An environment that respects and appreciates diversity - Racial and ethnic diversity are increasing rapidly in today's workplace. In order to increase diversity, managers may utilize “diversity management” in which they use a variety of management techniques in order to augment the positive outcomes that are linked with diversity in the workplace. Major theoretical approaches and applications Emphasis on the relationship between work and fulfillment can be traced back to Sigmund Freud who noted that a healthy life is one in which people have the ability to love and work. Research confirms that when individuals are gainfully employed, as characterized by a safe environment, purpose derived from work, engagement, etc., their quality of and satisfaction with life increases. Gainful employment is most often approached from a psychological standpoint with business, real world, and clinical applications. Specifically, the Strengths- Based Practice is a psychological approach to gainful employment that has business applications for the employed and people in management positions. In management in particular, managers who focus on employee strengths, communicate company goals, and give constructive feedback to employees promote gainful employment. One example of this is the Clifton Strengths Finder, from the book Now, Discover Your Strengths which employs positive psychology principles to build on the strengths that employees already have, as opposed to changing their weaknesses and deficiencies. According to a study done by Clifton and Harter, the strengths-based approach to gainful employment results in three major steps 1) the identification of talents, 2) the integration of talents into the employee's image and workplace, and 3) tactual behavior change in which the employee begins to view his or her success as a result of his or her unique talents. Career counseling represents another psychological approach to gainful employment with business and real world applications for individuals seeking employment. Vocational counselors work with individuals who are considering new careers not only to secure employment for them, but also to ensure organizational fit and job satisfaction. For example, a vocational counselor may ask their client to complete an Assets Exercise, in which the client writes down his or her “Assets” and Debits” on a sheet of paper with two-columns—one for “Assets” and another for “Debits”. This exercise allows the client to consider his or her strengths, interests, and talents, and helps the counselor determine what types of professions will be the most beneficial for the client. Gainful employment, when approached from a psychological perspective has been shown to have relevant clinical and real world applications. Individuals with traumatic brain injuries demonstrate greater psychological well-being and perceived quality of life if gainfully employed. In a study assessing perceived quality of life in individuals with traumatic brain injury, findings indicated that the level of engagement in work activities was significantly related to perceived quality of life, suggesting that gainful employment leads to more favorable appraisals of quality of life. Similar findings argue that gainful employment may function to provide a buffer against depression and anxiety in individuals with traumatic brain injury. Gainful employment is also a contributing factor in the social perception of an individual by others. Gainful employment significantly reduces the social stigma shown by adults towards a fictional person coping with schizophrenia. These findings suggest that gainful employment has internal, clinical benefits for the individual as well as external, real-world benefits on how others perceive individuals Major empirical findings Major empirical findings indicate that if people have overall positive experiences at work, their overall job satisfaction will be higher even if their overall life satisfaction may not be high. For example, a study obtained data from 479 police officers to test the spillover effects of non-work experiences and non-work satisfaction on work experiences and work satisfaction. The findings note that job satisfaction is the fourth major category leading to overall life satisfaction. The findings also indicate that non-work satisfaction does not replace or compensate for a lack of job satisfaction. Additionally, quality of life is in part defined by social utility, of which a large consideration is an individual's ability to make meaningful contributions to society through gainful employment. Job fit and work environment appear to be key components of gainful employment. In an analysis of over 300,000 people, the phrase “I have the opportunity to do what I do best” was highly correlated with work productivity and success. This suggests that workers’ job fit and ability to perform well in an industry leads to increased job satisfaction. Additionally, studies indicate that working in low-control jobs, or jobs where workers do not have the ability to meet the job demands, is correlated with a 43% increased chance of death. Increased mortality was due to workers’ lack of job control to meet the demands of the job, which led to continuous job strain and stress. These findings argue in favor of gainful employment and provide evidence for the importance of job fit to the good life and overall health. Gainful employment may be heavily based on an individual's outlook. A study assessed outlook based on participants’ initial happiness, perspective on employment, and ability to make meaning out of their work. The findings indicate that employees who were already happy and had a positive outlook were more likely to find greater job satisfaction and success, which suggests that happiness and job satisfaction are bidirectional. These findings provide additional support for studies that argue that gainful employment is based less on one's external work environment and more on one's perspective of employment as either a job (focus on financial rewards and necessity), a career (focus on advancement), or a calling (focus on enjoyment of fulfilling, socially useful work). Individuals who view their work as a calling experience overall increased satisfaction. Legal concept in the United States From a legal standpoint, gainful employment is defined as work that a person can pursue and perform for money or activities intended to provide an income to a person. Recently gainful employment has also been approached from the political perspective and applied to education reform. The Gainful Employment Rule is an example of a policy regarding gainful employment that has educational applications. According to the U.S. Department of Education, the Gainful Employment Rule “requires schools to provide their students with an education adequate enough for them to pay their college loans back” so that they will be gainfully employed after they graduate from college. In October 2010, the Barack Obama administration designed a set of rules to provide aid for educational institutions. They expect this funding to protect students from inappropriate recruiting practices and increase information about the quality and effectiveness of college and training programs. Gainful employment and Social Security law The United States Social Security Administration uses a slightly differing definition of \\"Gainful Employment\\", when evaluating SSI and disability cases, referred to as \\"Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA)\\". SGA is defined as being able to make more than a set indexed amount of lawful wages per month, which is set higher for blind individuals than for non-blind individuals, pursuant to the Social Security Act. The amount set as of the year 2017 is $1,950 per month for legally blind individuals, and is $1,170 per month for non-blind individuals. However, the higher amount for blind individuals does not apply to SSI cases.United States Social Security Administration. https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/sga.html Ret. OCT 06, 2017 14:48 CST Controversy since 2010 A highly controversial topic is the Gainful Employment Rule proposed by the Obama administration in 2010. According to the administration, the main purpose of the rule is to create career colleges and training programs that better prepare students for gainful employment. In order to determine if programs prepare students for gainful employment, the U.S. Department of Education intends to measure the relationship between the debt students incur and their incomes after completing the program as well as the rate in which program enrollees repay their loans. If a program graduates a large share of students with high debt-to-income ratios, the program may be ineligible to participate in federal student funding. Opponents argue against the Gainful Employment Rule because it only applies to for-profit colleges, even though many graduates of non-profit and public colleges also fail to acquire gainful employment. Conclusion While unemployment rates continue to be a significant problem in terms of elevated overall percentages of the general population,U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000 RET. OCT 06,2017 15:04 CST positive psychologists would argue that the lack of gainfully employed individuals is also a pressing concern that deserves attention. The relationships between gainful employment and quality of life and satisfaction with life suggest that job satisfaction, as its own domain of happiness, is best achieved through gainful employment and is a necessary yet insufficient component of living a fulfilled and happy enough life.

McClung Museum located on the University of Tennessee campus in Knoxville, Tennessee. A graduate of the University of Tennessee (undergraduate) and the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee (Masters and PhD), Sullivan is renowned for her research and publications on subjects such as Southeastern United States prehistory, Mississippian chiefdoms, mortuary analysis, and archaeological curation. She has been a major contributor to the feminist/gender archaeology movement through her studies in social inequality, gender roles, and the historic significance of women in the development of modern archaeology.  Background and education  Sullivan was born in Kingsport, Tennessee on December 25, 1952. However, she spent the duration of her childhood in Cleveland, Tennessee, after her family's move to the small city near Chattanooga when Sullivan was one. Her father worked for Bowater Paper Company, while her mother, the daughter of German immigrants, raised Sullivan and her two younger sisters. Sullivan's interest in archaeology stemmed from a childhood love of National Geographic magazine. Through membership in her local Girl Scout troop, Sullivan received the opportunity to participate in her first excavation at the age of 17. The dig took place in Iowa during the summer of 1970, following her graduation from Cleveland High School. That fall, Sullivan entered her freshman year at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. In 1971 she applied to work on a dig and was denied the opportunity due to her sex. This would prove to be the first of many challenges Sullivan faced as a female in the largely male-dominated world of archaeology in the 1970s. However, in 1972 Congress passed the Equal Employment Opportunity Act prohibiting employment discrimination on basis of race, color, national origin, sex, religion, age, disability, political beliefs, or marital/family status. Following this legislation, Sullivan found work in the summer of 1973, a year prior to her graduation from the University of Tennessee with a Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology, on the Tellico Project, and was one of the first women at the University of Tennessee to receive a paid job in field archaeology. Subsequently, Sullivan worked on several cultural resource management projects in Tennessee, including the Phipps Bend Nuclear Project through the University of Alabama. In addition, Sullivan worked at Cahokia in the summer and fall of 1974. This project to investigate the east palisade was funded by the National Science Foundation under the direction of Melvin L. Fowler. While at Cahokia, Sullivan was inspired by women PhD students in archaeology, the first that she had met. In the summer of 1975, Sullivan was hired by the Archaeology Labs at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee to assist with analysis of a systematic surface collection from Ramey Field at Cahokia. In the fall of 1975, she enrolled in graduate school there. Lynne Goldstein served as her major professor. Sullivan received her Master of Science Degree in Anthropology and a Certificate in Museology in December 1977. After a stint doing archaeological surveys for the Illinois Department of Transportation through the University of Illinois, Sullivan returned to the University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee for her doctoral work. She received a National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant for her research on the Mouse Creek Phase, a Late Mississippian complex near her hometown of Cleveland TN. The most extensive excavations at three Mouse Creek phase sites took place during the 1930s by the University of Tennessee working in conjunction with the federal Works Progress Administration, a program initiated for the creation of jobs under the New Deal. The collections from these sites are curated at McClung Museum on the campus of Sullivan's undergraduate alma mater, the University of Tennessee. Sullivan received her doctorate in 1986 from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.  Post-graduate research history  While completing her dissertation, Sullivan worked for the Dickson Mounds branch of the Illinois State Museum and subsequently received a job with Southern Illinois University at Carbondale. While a doctoral student, she had previously worked for SIU as a project director for CRM projects. Sullivan was the University's first non-graduate to serve as curator of the Center for Archaeological Investigation's collections. Following her job at Southern Illinois, Sullivan became the first female Curator of Anthropology at the New York State Museum in Albany, New York. During her thirteen-year-long employment at that museum, Sullivan played a major role in the renovation and reorganization of the Museum's vast archaeological collections. She obtained two National Science Foundation Systematic Anthropological Collections grants to do the first comprehensive inventory and records organization of the 150-year-old archaeological collections, as well a national Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act grant to do the first ever inventory of the Museum's human osteology collections. She also began field schools at the Ripley site, a late prehistoric and proto-historic site in western New York which had been partially excavated by Arthur C. Parker in the early twentieth century. With colleagues Sarah and Phillip Neusius, she won National Science Foundation funding for that project. While in New York, Sullivan continued her main research interests in the Mississippian Period in eastern Tennessee. She obtained National Science Foundation funding for a pottery seriation project and began a small field school on the Hiwassee Island site with Appalachian State University and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. In 1999, Sullivan left her post in New York and returned to the site of her undergraduate education in order to take the Curator of Archaeology position at the University of Tennessee's McClung Museum. Sullivan has worked for the University of Tennessee for twelve years, performing duties both in her capacity as Curator of Archaeology and as Adjunct Professor of Anthropology. She is responsible for managing the museum's extensive collections, advising a small group of graduate students, and conducting her own research for publication. Additionally, she served as the first female editor of Southeastern Archaeology, the Southeastern Archaeological Conference's annual journal, as well as chair of the Society for American Archaeology's Committee on Museums, Collections, and Curation.  Research projects  Sullivan's research encompasses a diverse body of work including subjects such as Southeastern prehistory, Mississippian chiefdom societies, mortuary analysis, curation and preservation, social inequality, gender roles, and history of archaeology. She has published seven books and numerous articles on these topics.  Mississippian chronology project  One of Sullivan's biggest projects has been a career-long undertaking to understand chronological and spatial variation during the Mississippian Period in eastern Tennessee. As of 2001, the accepted chronology for eastern Tennessee divides the Mississippian period into the Martin Farm (900-1100 AD), Hiwassee Island (1100-1300 AD), Dallas (1300–1600), and Mouse Creek (1400–1600) phases.Sullivan, L. 1991, Mouse Creek Phase Communities. Research Notes No. 6, Frank H. McClung Museum. The centuries–long duration of these phases prohibits meaningful interpretations of settlement patterning as well as variation and shifts in sociopolitical organization because it is not possible to determine which sites are contemporaneous. Sullivan, with her graduate students, has focused on obtaining high precision accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dates for sites excavated in the 1930s and for which no absolute dates had been obtained,Sullivan, L. 2007. Dating the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex in Eastern Tennessee. In Southeastern Ceremonial Complex: Chronology, Iconography, and Style, Adam King, ed., pp. 88-106. University of Alabama Press.

University of Tennessee Press. Knoxville. as well as obtaining such dates for important sites for which there were only standard radiocarbon dates with large standard deviations.4Koerner, Shannon R., Lynne P. Sullivan, and Bobby R. Braly 2011 A Reassessment of the Chronology of Mound A at Toqua. Southeastern Archaeology vol. 30 no. 1 (Summer). In press. Recently, this work has interfaced with dendrochronological studies by Henri Grissino-Mayer which has incorporated samples made in the 1930s by Florence Hawley from living trees in the Norris Basin and from archaeological sites excavated by the WPA in several areas of eastern Tennessee. Sullivan has encouraged and assisted several graduate students to become interested in this project and they have produced relevant theses and dissertations. In addition to her research centered on Tennessee- based sites, Sullivan, with Timothy Pauketat, studied Cahokia's Mound 31 in order to establish the chronological placement of this mound. The mound appears to have been in use during Cahokia's late Lohmann/early Stirling phases (1050-1150 AD) and Morehead phase (1200-1275 AD). This temporal placement helps provide a better understanding for the chronological development of the Cahokia site and complex society during this time.Sullivan and Pauketat 2007, Cahokia's Mound 31: A Short-Term Occupation at a Long-Term Site. Southeastern Archaeology 26(1):12-31.  Gender/Feminist archaeology  One area of particular interest to Sullivan is that of the role of women in both prehistoric society and the development of modern archaeology. As a female working in a largely male-dominated field of study, Sullivan has faced prejudice throughout her career due to her gender. Inspired by women such as McClung Museum founder Madeleine Kneberg and dendrochronologist Florence Hawley, both of whom made vast contributions to Tennessee archaeology with very little recognition compared to their male colleagues, Sullivan has become a prominent proponent of the gender/feminist archaeology movement that developed in the 1970s as a faction of post-processual archaeological theory. Her research on gender roles and social inequality overlaps with her studies on mortuary practices and sociopolitical hierarchy, and has helped provide a balanced perspective of Native American society.Sullivan and Rodning 2010, Residential Burial, Gender Roles, and Political Development in Late Prehistoric and Early Cherokee Cultures of the Southern Appalachians. In Residential Burial: A Multi-Regional Exploration, edited by Ron Adams & Stacie King, pp. 79-97. AP3A Series, American Anthropological Association. Washington D.C.  WPA collections preservation project and curation  In examining the Mouse Creek phase data set for her dissertation, Sullivan noticed that large amounts of materials collected by the Works Progress Administration excavations during the 1930s had yet to be properly organized and examined. Sites from Tennessee Valley Authority Reservoir projects, such as Norris, Watts Bar, and the Chickamauga Basin, had no reports and the collections needed better curatorial conditions. She took it upon herself to compile and complete the report for the Chickamauga Basin project and to get this important work published by the University of Tennessee Press. This project excavated many of the type sites for archaeological phases in eastern Tennessee. As Curator of Archaeology at the McClung Museum, Sullivan has made the preservation of the WPA collections one of her priorities. Working with the UT Libraries, she sought and received grant funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services to create an online archive of the WPA-ers archaeological photos from the McClung Museum as well as the Alabama Museum of Natural History at the University of Alabama and the Webb Museum at the University of Kentucky. She also obtained funds from the federal Save America's Treasures program to rehouse the fragile and temporally diagnostic artifacts in the WPA collections into state-of-the-art museum cabinetry and to create an electronic inventory of these objects. Sullivan has also facilitated scanning of the WPA-era field records by student workers. These projects have both increased access to these document and artifacts as well as helped to preserve them for posterity. Additionally, Sullivan has encouraged the study of these collections by numerous graduate students at UT and elsewhere. In 2003, Sullivan published with S. Terry Childs a book entitled Curating Archaeological Collections: From the Field to the Repository, which was the first book devoted to archaeological curation issues in the United States.  Bibliography  Sullivan's publications reflect the diversity of her research, and include subjects such as the prehistoric Southeastern U.S., the curation/preservation of artifact collections, mortuary analysis, and the role of women in the development of modern archaeology.

It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. History The first castle was built before 1100 on a hill in the middle of the village of Attinghausen. Virtually nothing is known about the first owners of the castle, although they were probably knights in the service of the Counts of Zähringen and they may have used the name von Attinghausen. By the 13th century, the original owners were gone from the castle and the von Schweinsberg family had come to own it, possibly through Ulrich von Schweinsberg marrying a daughter of the original Attinghausens. The original castle was probably a Motte-and-bailey castle which was spread across the hilltop. The Freiherr von Schweinsberg first appears in documents in the 13th century from Wartenstein Castle in the Bernese Emmental. But a branch of the family was in Uri by the mid-13th century and had then occupied the castle, sometimes adopting the castle's name as their family name. They also built Schweinsberg Castle a short distance north of Attinghausen. By 1300, there were two branches: one under Werner II who held the lands in Uri, and another under Diethelm I in the Berner Oberland. The Uri branch of the family is traditionally believed to have been critical supporters of the Three Forest Cantons and the early Swiss Confederacy. Werner II and his son Johann were the Landammann of Uri from 1294 until 1358/59. It is unknown what role, if any, Werner played at the Battle of Morgarten in 1315, but in 1339 Johann led the army of Uri at the Battle of Laupen. The Schweinsberg/Attinghausens replaced the original fortifications with an square tower and a ring wall. The main entrance into the tower was via a wooden staircase to the second or third level. The gatehouse was in the western wall. A massive wooden structure was built on the southern side of the ring wall. Around 1300, the wooden building was replaced with a large stone residential building, which may have had stables and granaries on the ground floor and bedrooms above. The family's wealth and influence continued to rise, and on 1 May 1351, Rudolf Brun of Zurich and Johann von Attinghausen signed an alliance that brought Zurich into the growing Swiss Confederation. In 1353 they received a fief that included the Imperial customs post at the Castle of Rudenz and he became the Rector over Valais. Johann died in 1358. Traditionally, it was believed that he died during an insurrection, which also destroyed the castle. However, more recent research indicates that he might have died of disease or while marching with his army. Johann's son, Jacob, was with the Pope in Avignon, but either did not return to Uri or died while returning. Two of his cousins, Werner and Johann von Simpeln, probably took over the Attinghausen lands and the castle in 1359. However, they both died soon thereafter, either from disease or in the 1360 fire that destroyed the castle. The Lords of Rudenz then inherited the Attinghausen lands, but could not afford to rebuild the castle. Instead they settled in Rudenz Castle in Flüelen and Attinghausen castle was abandoned. In 1894 the castle ruins were first excavated and in 1896 they were sold to the Historical Society of Uri. In 1979 an archeological investigation of the ruins discovered numerous artifacts from the castle's residents. By 2007, the ruins were unsafe and the Historical Society closed them to the public. Through donations from the public they raised enough money to thoroughly investigate, document and repair the castle ruins. In 2012 the ruins reopened to the public.

It is the ascription given to the female protagonist in the Song of Songs in the Hebrew Bible. In the King James Version and other Bibles, it is the Song of Solomon or Canticle of Canticles. Background She is most likely called the Shulammite because she came from an unidentified place called Shulem. Many scholars consider Shulammite to be synonymous with Shunammite (“person from Shunem”). Shunem was a village in the territory of Issachar, north of Jezreel and south of Mount Gilboa. Other scholars link Shulem with Salem, believing Solomon’s bride was from Jerusalem. Still others believe that the title Shulammite (“peaceful”) is simply the bride’s married name, being the feminine form of Solomon (“peaceful”) and only used after her marriage to the king. Solomon uses passionate language to describe his bride and their love (Song 4:1–15). Solomon clearly loved the Shulammite—and he admired her character as well as her beauty (Song 6:9). Everything about the Song of Solomon portrays the fact that this bride and groom were passionately in love and that there was mutual respect and friendship, as well (Song 8:6–7).

The church bears testimony to the existence of a significant Armenian community in the region in the 17th and 18th centuries. History Following the domination of their homeland by Persian powers of the time, Armenians were sent by their new rulers to the Bengal region for both political and economic reasons. Although the Armenian presence in South Asia is now insignificant, their presence in Dhaka dates back to the 17th century. Armenians came to Dhaka for business. In Dhaka, Armenian merchants traded in jute and leather, and profitability in these businesses convinced some to move permanently to Bangladesh. The area where they lived became known as Armanitola.http://www.lonelyplanet.com/bangladesh/dhaka/sights/religious/armenian- church-holy-resurrection In 1781 the now famous Armenian Church was built on Armenian Street in Armanitola, then a thriving business district. The site was an Armenian graveyard before the church was built, and the tombstones that have survived serve as a chronicle of Armenian life in the area. Agaminus Catachik, an Armenian, gave away the land to build the church. Michel Cerkess, Okotavata Setoor Sevorg, Aga Amnius, and Merkers Poges helped build the church. In the fifty years following the church's construction, a clock tower was erected on its western side. Allegedly, the clock could be heard four miles away, and people synchronised their watches with the sound of the tower's bell. The clock stopped in 1880, and an earthquake destroyed the tower in 1897. The Armenians played a prominent part in the jute trade in Dhaka and are reputed to be the pioneers of that trade in the second half of the 19th century. Today, the last Armenian that takes cares of the church is Mikel Housep Martirossian (Michael Joseph Martin).http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/2645617.stmhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2645617.stm He was also one of the Armenian who was in the jute trade. Architecture Armenian Church, 2008 The church is in length. It has 4 doors, 27 windows. The main floor is divided into three parts: a pulpit enclosed by railings, a middle section with two folding doors, and an area separated by a wooden fence for seating. There is a spiral staircase into the second floor of the church. Beside of this there was a watch house built by Johans Paru Piyete Sarkis. The watch house was destroyed by an earthquake in 1897. There is a square tower on the church with a \\"shonkhonil\\" (special type of minar used in India to show respect) minar on the top of it. The aisle of the church is 14 feet wide. There are some beautiful paintings in the church, by the artist Charles Port. There is a room behind the pulpit used for baptism, with a 3 foot deep marble baptismal font. Modern use Mother Teresa stayed in the church compound during a 1996 visit to Dhaka. In the old graveyard, amongst the 350 people buried there, a statue stands at the grave of Catachik Avatik Thomas, portraying his wife. The statue was bought from Kolkata and the grave is inscribed with the words \\"Best of Husband.\\" It was a subject of BBC and AFP documentaries before it was declared as a religious and historical heritage by the government of Bangladesh and put under supervision of the Department of Archaeology, Ministry of Cultural Affairs of Bangladesh that has taken measures to restore and safeguard the cultural heritage. Government of Armenia has shown interest to cooperate in the effort of the Bangladesh government. Now the site is open during daytime for the visitors.

Narodoni dim literally means \\"people's home\\" or \\"national hall\\". Narodny domy (plural) were modeled after the chytalni or reading halls of Austrian Galicia, many of which were coordinated by the Prosvita society. Members of the Supreme Ruthenian Council () started establishing these halls in the Austrian-ruled Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria during the \\"Spring of Nations\\" period of European history.  Canada  Narodni domy in Canada typically were either governed independently or affiliated with various political or religious groups who competed for members and funds. In Alberta in the early 20th century 45% of the halls were independent, 35% were communist, and the rest were Ukrainian Catholic- controlled. Independent halls were often linked to either the \\"Russo-Greek Orthodox\\" church or the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada. Socialist halls were organized by the Ukrainian Labour-Farmer Temple Association, and became known as \\"labour temples\\". The main function of the hall's governing board (zariad) is to organize plays, concerts, dances, and other cultural activities. They have differed from other community halls in Canada by offering Ukrainian-language music and plays and because of their political and religious associations. Small narodni domy were once common throughout the Ukrainian bloc settlements but many of those have since closed, and the remaining ones tend to be in larger urban centres. Examples are: * Ukrainian Cultural Centre of Toronto * Ukrainian Labour Temple, Winnipeg  Ukraine  The Prosvita chytalni / reading halls survived the Ukrainian War of Independence from 1918 to 1921 and the Pacification of Ukrainians in Eastern Galicia in 1930. However, the network of these community halls was liquidated by the Soviet regime in 1939 after their annexation of West Ukraine (East Poland).Orlevych, I.

An only child, Kelly spent his younger years in Kensington, Philadelphia. His mother was a housewife and his father a police officer and detective with the Philadelphia Police Department. He attended The Ascension of Our Lord Grammar School and Northeast Catholic High School. An avid fan of American Bandstand, Kelly made his first appearance on the show in 1959. Kelly was featured in national teen magazines of the time (Teen, 16, Dig, Teen Screen, Movie Teen Illustrated etc.) but was one of the few regulars to be acknowledged outside of the fan based periodicals, like Photoplay magazine, which was primarily devoted to Hollywood movie stars. Kelly appeared in the 1997 Teleductions documentary, Bandstand Days, and represented Bandstand in the American Bandstand Anniversary Special 33 1/3 held in Santa Monica, California. In 1985, he was one of only six regular Bandstand dancers to appear on The Oprah Winfrey Show. He has been a guest on The Today Show, and, along with his Bandstand partner, Kathleen \\"Bunny\\" Gibson, made a cameo appearance on American Dreams the TV series.

In the war which the Spartans carried on against Elis at the close of the Peloponnesian War, Pausanias, king of Sparta, took Lasion. The invasion of Pausanias is not mentioned by Xenophon in his account of this war; but the latter author relates that, by the treaty of peace concluded between Elis and Sparta in 400 BCE, the Eleians were obliged to give up Lasion, in consequence of its being claimed by the Arcadians. In 366 BCE the Eleians attempted to recover Lasion from the Arcadians; they took the town by surprise, but were shortly afterwards driven out of it again by the Arcadians. et seq. In 219 BCE, Lasion was again a fortress of Elis, but upon the capture of Psophis by Philip V of Macedon, the Eleian garrison at Lasion straightway deserted the place; after Philip took the town, he gave it to the Achaeans.

Their musical style has been compared to that of Evanescence.  Biography  Julia in 2012  Formation  In the summer of 2007 vocalist Julia Flansburg and bass guitarist Glenn Flansburg dreamed of having their own band. Their dream was fulfilled in October of that year when they found a drummer, Bandon Fields and lead guitarist, Jose Gabaldon. In April 2008 the band had their first performance for 97.1 FM The Buzz's Annual March Bandness of Rock, with a new guitarist, Tal Raz, who had replaced Jose. The band made it to the final four of the competition. Encouraged, the band continued to perform in the Oklahoma City area. By June 2008, Sean Doyle joined in on guitar and David Baker on keyboards. In September, Tal left the band and was replaced by Mark Johnson. In December, the band took time off, upon learning Julia was pregnant. The band reformed with a new drummer, Tanner Hodgkinson in early 2009. The following couple of years proved difficult and the line up on guitars changed frequently. In January 2009 Mark left the band to join Horse Called War. He was replaced by Jordan Barbour. Several shows were played during the early months of 2009. Sean left the band in August 2009 and he was replaced by current guitarist Steven Bittle. Also, Tanner left the band the same month and was replaced by John Kenerson.  EP: 2010  Recording of an EP began in December 2009. But while preparing for the recording in November, Jordan had to leave the band for personal reasons. He was replaced by a classmate of Glenn’s, Derek Teague. Shortly afterward, David had to leave the band for work related reasons. He was soon replaced by Jennifer Corbin, who finished up the recording. Throughout the busy year of 2010, more than 30 shows were performed. In August 2010, the band released their first studio recording, a six song EP. Shortly aftwards, John left the band and Tanner was brought back to play the drums. A distribution deal was made with BlueFreya to bring the new album to music stores in Australia in November 2010. The album was well received and claimed many well favored reviews.  The Eleventh Hour: 2011 onward  In February 2011, Jennifer left the band and David was brought back again to play the keyboards until a permanent replacement could be found. May 2011 was a busy month for the band. Robby Ray was brought in as the full-time replacement for keyboards. Tanner left the band and was replaced by Jeremy \\"JC\\" Clifton, formerly of \\"Horse Called War\\", as the new drummer. Derek announced his departure from the band to continue his college education in Nashville. Angelical Tears played at Dame-Nation in Chicago, Illinois on July 29, 2011. Their second album, The Eleventh Hour, was self-released on June 23, 2012. It contains 13 tracks including two bonus tracks. In May 2013, JC left the band. The band has a tentative agreement to work with former Where Angels Fall drummer Ole Kristian Løvberg for their next album due to release in 2014.

Above its doorway is an embedded sign: \\"the synagogue\\". The structure is currently controlled by the Melkite (Greek Catholic) Church. History In 570, an Italian visitor described Nazareth's synagogue, and reported that the original Bible was still there, including the bench where Jesus used to sit.Milani, Celestina, Itinerarium Antonini Placentini. Viaggio in Terra Santa del 560-570 d.C., Milan, 1977, p. 238 The floor of the Synagogue Church is sunken about 1.5 meters underground, possibly built atop a Crusader church dating from the 12th century. The church was under the control of the Franciscans until the 18th century, when the ruler Zahir al-Umar passed it to the Greek Catholics. Christian tradition According to Christian tradition, the church is built on the ruins of the ancient Nazareth synagogue where Jesus studied and prayed. In addition, it is where one Sabbath day Jesus went to preach. In two Gospels (), his fellow townspeople became angry with him. Because he was one of them, they did not trust him to have the authority to preach in that way and to perform miracles. He was amazed at their lack of faith and concluded that a prophet is not honoured in his own home town. In , the account differs: there, Jesus reads from and the worshippers are pleased. But he tells them that prophets are called to do their work in foreign places rather than at home, because they are not accepted in their own home town. In doing this, he also implicitly declares himself as the Messiah. This sermon infuriates the listeners, who drag him to a cliff to throw him over, but he simply walks through the crowd and leaves. Significance Little is known of the years Jesus spent in Nazareth, leading scholarsPaul VI at Nazareth, January 5, 1964: LH, Feast of the Holy Family, OR. to describe this time as \\"the hidden life\\" or \\"the silent years\\". It is thus all the more significant for Christian visitors to find a lone place where such silence is broken – the Synagogue Church.

They were discovered by M. S. Moulds in 1977 and are found only in an isolated rainforest of Australia. Antlered flies, collectively, are notable for their unique mating behavior and the unusual antler-like extensions on the heads of the males.Dodson, Gary N. 2000. Behavior of the Phytalmiinae and the evolution of antlers in tephritid flies. In: Aluja, Martin, Allen L. Norrbom, [ed.]. Fruit Flies (Tephritidae). New York: CRC Press, 2000. pp. 175-184. Description This species exhibits sexual dimorphism where the females and males look different from one another. The males have red, paddle-shaped, antler-like protrusions on their cheek region that will bend under pressure.Sivinski, John. Ornaments in the Diptera. The Florida Entomologist. Vol. 80, No. 2, pp. 142-164. Jun. 1997. The females have no antlers. The males are generally larger than the females and have longer back legs than females.Schutze, Mark K., Yeates, David K., Graham, Glenn C., and Dodson, Gary. 2007. Phylogenetic relationships of antlered flies, Phytalmia Gerstaecker (Diptera: Tephritidae): the evolution of antler shape and mating behavior. Australian Journal of Entomology [Aust. J. Entomol.]. Vol. 46, no. 4, pp. 281-293. Nov 2007. The male characteristics (size, long back legs, antlers) are most likely a result of sexual selection.Thornbill, Randy, Dodson, Gary, and Marshall, Larry. Sexual Selection and Insect Mating Behavior. The American Biology Teacher. Vol. 45, No. 6, Special Focus on Ecology and Evolution of Animal Behavior (Oct., 1983), pp. 310-319 The longer back legs and larger size give males an advantage when engaging in vertical pushing contests with other males. Females have a smaller rear to foreleg ratio because they do not engage in pushing contests. Antler size is strongly correlated with body size in males. It is hypothesized that antlers developed as size indicators and not as weapons so that the males can avoid wasting time and energy in fights against larger males. Also, males have pronounced spines on their fore femurs that are used to grip females. Range Phytalmia mouldsi lives only in one rainforest area on the northeast coast of the Cape York Peninsula of Australia. They lay their eggs and the larvae only eat one specific species of decaying tree: Dysoxylum gaudichaudianum. Mating behavior Phytalmia mouldsi uses a resource defense mating system.Gary, Dodson. Resource defense mating system in antlered flies, Phytalmia spp. (Diptera: Tephritidae). Annals of the Entomological Society of America, Vol. 90, no. 4, pp. 496-504. Jul 1997. In this system the males search for a desirable spot for the females to deposit their eggs, and then they guard that spot and await interested females. They will fight off other males who want that spot even while mating with or guarding a female. When a female approaches the male will extend its wings out and keep the female from reaching the oviposit site. The male will then mount the female and latch on behind the wings of the female. This is called a “wing-lock.” The male will hold onto the female in this way during copulation and while the female is ovipositing. This way the male can protect his egg site and the female from other males. If one male challenges another male for his site or his female the males will judge each other and if one is substantially smaller than the other the smaller one will forfeit without a fight. If the males are equally sized, however, they will engage in a shoving contest in which they stand on their hind four legs and shove each other with their epistomal margins of their heads pressed together. This “stilting” has been observed in several other species of fruit flies. Their antlers are not used to jab or push as in some other species of antlered flies; instead the antlers are used more as a tool to judge the size of one’s opponent. If a male is significantly smaller than his opponent it would not be worth his energy to compete and lose. After copulation and ovipositing, the male will release the female from the “wing- lock” and the two will part ways. The male will stay to protect the egg site, sometimes for several days, waiting for more females to come by. The female will likewise search for more oviposition sites and encounter more guarding males. Experimentation When antlers were removed or shortened the larger males were still more successful in encounters with other males (larger males won 75 percent of the time). However, larger males with their antlers removed engaged more often in energy-consuming stilting contests than males of comparable size with intact antlers. This suggests that the males do use antler size to judge to size of their opponent when deciding whether to engage in a fight. A similar phenomenon is seen in other parts of the animal kingdom. Most similar are stalk-eyed flies; the males compare eye stalk spans to determine the winner and avoid an energy-consuming encounter (6). Evolution of antlers in Phytalmiinae It is hypothesized that antlers in flies evolved several times because the antlers serve different purposes in other antlered fly species. Other species use antlers to push or prod their opponent whereas the P. mouldsi uses them only to size-up their opponent. In fact, P. mouldsi has the least complex antlers of the Phytalmiinae subfamily. The six other antlered species in Phytalmiinae include P. cervicornis, P. alcicornis, P. biarmata, P. megalotis, P. antilocapra, and P. robertsi. Recent research about antlered flies In 2005, a study was conducted on several species of Phytalmia to determine is environmental stresses negatively impacted development of antlers. It was hypothesized that the stresses, specifically deforestation, would cause the males to grow more asymmetrical antlers. Only one species, Phytalia biarmata, showed increased asymmetry in deforested areas; so, the data did not strongly support the hypothesis.Gary, Dodson. A test of fluctuating asymmetry as a bioindicator of stress in antlered flies. Pacific Conservation Biology. Vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 121-127. 2005. ReferencesExternal links * Author. Title.

He was the Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum in 1912–32. Biography=Student Campbell Dodgson was the eighth and last child of William Oliver Dodgson, a London stockbroker, and Lucy Elizabeth Smith, daughter of Henley Smith who owned the Priory on the Isle of Wight which had been passed into the Grose-Smith family after the death of Sir Nash Grose.Birth certificate for Campbell Dodgson, Lucy Elizabeth Smith He was a distant cousin of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known as author Lewis Carroll. His close relatives included his brother Edward Spencer Dodgson, his nephew the artist John Arthur Dodgson, and his great-nephew the British composer and broadcaster Stephen Cuthbert Dodgson. Dodgson was a scholar at Winchester, 1880–86, and New College, Oxford University, 1886–91, where he was listed in the directory as having studied previously at Winchester College, and the seventh son of William Oliver Dodgson, gentleman.Oxford Men and Their Colleges, 1880-1892, 2 Volumes, pg 123 He obtained a First in Greats (ancient history and philosophy) in 1890, and a Second in Theology in 1891. In 1934 Dodgson was given the honorary degree of DLitt at Oxford Convocation. The Times of London reports: \\"Mr. Dodgson was described as ex animo Wiccamicus, Collegii Novi quondam scholaris et Custodis illustrissimi, nuper perempti, gener. His long and distinguished record as Keeper of Drawings and Prints at the, British Museum testifies to his expert knowledge, as does also his editorship of the Print' Collectors' Quarterly. The Ashmolean has to thank him not only for a catalogue of woodcuts but for training Dr. Parker, the present Keeper of the Department of Fine Arts. He has recently been awarded the Hindenburg Prize for Kunst und Wissenschafft.\\" Curator Dodgson initially worked as a tutor, attempting to help his fellow Oxonian Lord Alfred Douglas. An active poet and not-so-active student, Lord Alfred had been sent down from Magdalen College in Hilary term, and the tutorship was a last-ditch attempt to assist the poet to restart his studies and take a degree. After this push failed, Dodgson was called later in 1893 to the British Museum, where he established his career as a librarian and became an art historian specializing in works on paper (1893-1932). He learnt German, 'writing German without difficulty' (DNB, 1941-50 : 215) and made many contributions to German periodicals (ibid.). On the retirement of Sir Sidney Colvin in 1912 Dodgson was appointed Keeper of Prints and Drawings. Dodgson specialized in early modern Flemish and German prints, and published extensively on the works of Albrecht Dürer, but he also applied his expertise to works of many other schools and periods. During the First World War (1914–18) he worked in Intelligence for the War Office; his 1918 CBE was a recognition of this work (DNB, 1941-50 : 216). In 1913 Dodgson married Frances Catharine Spooner, an artist who trained at the Slade School and became known as Catharine Dodgson. Catharine Dodgson was the eldest daughter of William Archibald Spooner (Warden of New College and the eponymous author of 'Spoonerisms'), in 1913 (DNB, 1941-50 : 216). Dodgson was the editor, in the 1920s, of The Print Collector’s Quarterly. He was also a contributor to The Burlington Magazine and to the Dictionary of National Biography. Dodgson gave generously to the British Museum during his Keepership, but at the same time amassed a very large collection of over 5,000 prints which he bequeathed to the Museum.British Museum Collection This included the first works by Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí to enter that collection. The same bequest included also the box file Dodgson used to document his acquisitions, which have recently been added to the British Museum’s online database.Genevieve Verdigel, 'Campbell Dodgson's box file', Print Quarterly, vol.XXXV, no.4, December 2018, pp. 446-48. He wrote about and championed women artists, including his wife Catherine Dodgson, Gwen Raverat, and Margaret Pilkington.

Doheny, Charles A. Canfield and Max H. Whittier who became known as the \\"big four.\\"  Early life  O'Donnell was born in McKean, Erie County, Pennsylvania to Thomas O'Donnell and Myra Parsons,. He was of Irish descent. While still living in McKean Township he worked for some time as a newsboy until the age 12 when he left Pennsylvania and arrived in Florence, Colorado. He remained there for two years working in an all-around capacity as a grocery store clerk. With his ambitions extending beyond the grocery store, O'Donnell went to work in a gold mine and for the next five years, with pick and shovel, became a very experienced miner by the age of 19. In 1889 he gave up mining and headed to California where he obtained a position at the Union Oil Company in Ventura County remaining there for four years where he mastered the oil business.  Career  Leaving Union Oil in 1893, O'Donnell went to Los Angeles where he met Edward L. Doheny, a wealthy pioneer in the development of oil in California. Working as a field superintendent for Doheny for about a year, O'Donnell too saw the promise that the oil fields held and decided to go into business for himself forming a partnership drilling oil wells with Max H. Whittier. The partnership with Whittier lasted for five years, at the end of which, O'Donnell decided to continue alone becoming an independent driller, operator and oil land speculator. In 1902, O'Donnell entered the oil fields in Coalinga, California, and his success there was one of the most remarkable on record. He organized several companies and financed many of them himself. As well as holding other positions in other companies, O'Donnell held presidencies in the Whittier Consolidated Oil Company, Midland Oil Fields Company, Four Oil Company, Section One Oil Company, Circle Oil Company, Maricopa Star Oil Company, California Star Oil Company, Buena Fe Petroleum and Salvia Oil Company. When Doheny became interested in Mexican oil holdings in 1907, O'Donnell handled his interests in California and helped form the American Petroleum Company, followed by the American Oil Fields Company, holding the positions of vice-president and field manager of both companies. At the time, the two companies were among the largest independent concerns in the United States controlling wide areas of the best oil lands in the most productive districts of California. In 1912, the two companies merged into the California Petroleum Corporation, known as CALPET. O'Donnell served as president and board chairman of CALPET until it was sold to the Texas Company (later known as Texaco). O'Donnell became a director in the Texas Company later retiring from that position. During World War I, O'Donnell served with the Fuel Conservation Board and became national director of oil production for the United States Fuel Administration. Upon his departure, O'Donnell received a letter and check for one dollar from Harry A. Garfield, United States Fuel Administrator, as a token of appreciation in recognition of his service as a volunteer. O'Donnell became the first president of the American Petroleum Institute, the largest national trade association representing the industry, serving from 1919 – 1924. He was also influential in forming the Independent Oil Producers Association and served as a member of the executive board. O'Donnell held directorships at the Farmers and Merchants National Bank, Mexican Petroleum Company and a number of other Doheny oil companies. He also headed several committees including one to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson regarding the protection of interests in Tampico, Mexico during the Tampico Affair.  Family  O'Donnell met Lillian Constance Wood, a native of California, and married her in 1897. They had two daughters, Ruth O'Donnell Davis (October 24, 1898 – January 28, 1985) and Doris O'Donnell Connolly (January 5, 1901 – 1977). Lillian and O'Donnell divorced in 1924 and a property settlement of $750,000 in cash and security was approved by the court. A year later he married Dr. Winifred Willis (November 5, 1880 – January 24, 1969), a Long Beach osteopath, in the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C.. Willis was considered to be one of the most prominent osteopaths in Southern California and a leader in that profession in all the country. Willis was born in New York and married William E. Jenney, a successful dentist, in 1900 and moving to California in 1916. Winifred and William were later divorced in 1924. Palm Springs O'Donnell went to Palm Springs, California in the early 1920s seeking relief from a respiratory condition. On of leased land from Nellie Coffman, owner of the Desert Inn, he constructed the home which would become the O'Donnell House – also known as \\"Ojo del Desierto\\", or Eye of the Desert. (here for Table of Contents) The \\"California Spanish\\"-style O'Donnell House was designed by W. C. Tanner and remained the highest mountainside home in Palm Springs for more than forty years. A aerial view of the O'Donnell Golf Club in Palm Springs For fifteen years, O'Donnell and his wife, Winifred, spent their winters at the O'Donnell House. O'Donnell's heart condition prevented him from using the stairs, so he decided to build a smaller, one story house on the nearby golf course which O'Donnell built with Captain J. F. Lucey. This house would later become the clubhouse for the O'Donnell Golf Club. The O'Donnell Golf Club was built in Palm Springs in the mid-1920s. He purchased the land in 1925 upon which the O'Donnell Course is now built, as well as seven hundred fifty shares of Whitewater Mutual Water Company and helped it bring fresh water through a pipeline from Whitewater Canyon to the desert before anyone knew there was water under Palm Springs. O'Donnell bought property at the corner of Stevens Road and North Palm Canyon Drive and built a reservoir, which also acted as a desalting basin, through which Whitewater Mutual routed its pipeline to the area that was to become the golf course. O'Donnell was one of the five incorporators of Whitewater Mutual Water Company, which was incorporated on May 5, 1927. In the following years O'Donnell built the golf course, and for the next fifteen years he operated it at his own expense before, in 1944 he organized the O'Donnell Golf Club as a private, non-profit club. He gave the club a ninety-nine year lease for the golf course, the reservoir property and the seven hundred fifty shares of the Whitewater Mutual stock. Dozens of benefactions and philanthropies can be attributed to O'Donnell, but probably biggest among these are his making possible, through his financial assistance, the Welwood Memorial Library, the Public Health Center, Welfare and Friendly Aid and the public address system on the mountainside above his home at the edge of the O'Donnell Golf Club.  Fraternities and clubs  As of 1912, O'Donnell was a Thirty-second Degree Mason, a Mystic Shriner and an Elk. He held memberships in the Jonathan Club and Sierra Madre Club, both of Los Angeles, and the Growler's Club of Coalinga. O'Donnell was also president of the O'Donnell Golf Club from 1944 until his death in 1945.  Death  After suffering a heart attack in 1941 during an influenza siege, O'Donnell died of a related heart ailment at the Wilshire Hospital in Los Angeles on February 21, 1945 at the age 74. Before passing he wrote \\"finis,\\" a Latin word meaning \\"the end.\\" The funeral services were held at the Church of the Recessional, Forest Lawn Memorial Park. Services were also held at the same time in Palm Springs near the entrance of the O'Donnell Golf Club.

It and Brettanomyces anomalus share identical mtDNA. In the wild, it is found on the skins of fruit. It has been shown to be useful for wine and beer fermentation as well as ethanol production.  History  In 1889, Seyffert of the Kalinkin Brewery in St.Petersburg was the first to isolate a \\"Torula\\" from English beer which produced the typical \\"English\\" taste in lager beer, and in 1899 JW Tullo at Guinness described two types of \\"secondary yeast\\" in Irish stout. However N. Hjelte Claussen at the Carlsberg brewery was the first to publish a description in 1904, following a 1903 patent (UK patent GB190328184) that was the first patented microorganism in history. Claussen named the genus Brettanomyces, which is Greek for British Fungus. For the most part Brettanomyces is viewed as a contaminant, as it forms compounds that lead to 'off-flavors in both wine and beer.\\"Oxford Companion to Wine — Brettanomyces\\". Also Heresztyn, T (1986). \\"Formation of substituted tetrahydropyridines by species of Brettanomyces and Lactobacillus isolated from mousey wines\\". American Journal of Enology and Viticulture (37): 127–32. However, several wines and beers use strains of Brettanomyces in low concentrations in order to achieve the desired taste. Brettanomyces claussenii is used for brewing beer. Originally isolated from strong English stock beer, it is a key component in some Belgian ales and sour beers.Burningham, Lucy. \\"Brewers Take Risks to Make Sour Beer - NYTimes.com.\\" The New York Times - Breaking News, World News & Multimedia. 1 June 2010. Web. 20 Apr. 2011. . It is said that fermentation with Brettanomyces claussenii will help a beer achieve English character. An alternative theory is that Professor Claussen named Brettanomyces after his 'beloved' Brittany, not Britain.Alexander, John. 'A Guide To Craft Brewing' page 170.  Taxonomy  Brettanomyces claussenii is a yeast in the kingdom fungi, the phylum ascomycota and the subphylum saccharomycotina, the so-called true yeasts. Yeasts in this subphylum reproduce asexually through budding. Baker's yeast and Brewer's yeast are in saccharomycotina as well. The genus Dekkera can be used interchangeably with Brettanomyces when describing species; Dekkera are the telemorphic (spore-forming) versions of the Brettanomyces species. Dekkera claussenii differs from other Dekkera species in its lack of blastese and inability to ferment lactose.Lee, Fwu-Wing, and Shung-Chang Jong. \\"Dekerra Claussenii; The Perfect State of Brettanomyces Claussenii.\\" Mycotaxon 23 (1985): 275-78. Examination of the Mitochondrial DNA of the genus Brettanomyces showed identical genomes in three pairs of species: Dekkera bruxellensis/Brettanomyces lambicus, Brettanomyces abstinens/Brettanomyces custerianus and Brettanomyces anomalus/Brettanomyces clausenii. It is suspected that the genus Dekkera has similar taxonomical redundancies.McArthur, C. R., and G.D. Clark-Walker. \\"Mitochondrial DNA Size Diversity in the Dekkera/Brettanomyces Yeasts.\\" Current Genetics 7 (1983): 29-35.  Uses  Brettanomyces claussenii is used for a variety of purposes. As a yeast, it is able to ferment cereals and fruits to produce beers and wines with unique flavor profiles. Brettanomyces claussenii can ferment a variety of other substances as well. Ethanol fuel is becoming more prevalent as an alternative fuel source for automobiles. Using waste wood and agricultural residue is one way to produce ethanol without using crops that could potentially be food sources, such as corn. Combined with Pichia Stipitis R, Brettanomyces claussenii has been shown to produce ethanol from lignocellusic material. The material is prehydrolysed with sulfur dioxide and then simultaneously saccrified and fermented. This fermentation is rapid and efficient, producing between 360 and 370 Liters of Ethanol per ton of prehydrolysed lignocellsic material.Wayman, Morris, Rannade S. Parekh, and Sarad R. Parekh. \\"Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation by Mixed Cultures Of Brettanomycesclausenii And Pichiaspipitis R of SO2-prehydrolysed Wood.\\" Biotechnology Letters 9 (1987): 435-40. However, Brettanomyces claussenii is unable to convert lactose to ethanol, like several other yeasts can.Bothast, R.J., C.P. Kurtzman, M.D. Saltarelli, and P.J. Slininger. \\"Ethanol Production by 107 Strains of Yeast on 5, 10 and 20% Lactose.\\" Biotechnology Letters 8.8 (1986): 593-96. In clusters of Brettanomyces claussenii a negative pasteur effect has been demonstrated. The rate of alcohol fermentation is reduced under anaerobic conditions and stimulated by the presence atmospheric oxygen. The fermentation rate is also sensitive to alkali concentrations. A heavily potassium solution will increase the rate of fermentation while increasing sodium will slow the processes.Wilken, T. O., A.J.M. Verhaar, and W. A. Scheffers. \\"The Influence of Potassium and Sodium Ions on the Negative Pasteur Effect in Brettanomyees Claussenii Clusters.\\" Archiv für Mikrobiologie 42.2 (1962): 226-36.

It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. History The Freiherr von Schweinsberg first appears in documents in the 13th century at Wartenstein Castle in the Bernese Emmental. But a branch of the family was in Uri by the mid 13th century and occupied the castle, sometimes adopting the castle's name as their family name. By 1300 there were two branches, one under Werner II who held the lands in Uri and another under Diethelm I in the Berner Oberland. The Uri branch of the family is traditionally believed to have been critical supporters of the Three Forest Cantons and the early Swiss Confederacy. Werner II and his son Johann were the Landammann of Uri from 1294 until 1358/59. It is unknown what role, if any, Werner played at the Battle of Morgarten in 1315, but in 1339 Johann led the army of Uri at the Battle of Laupen. The Schweinsberg/Attinghausen family owned Attinghausen Castle in the 13th century. As their fortunes grew in Uri, they built a second castle, Schweinsberg, a short distance north of Attinghausen later in the 13th century. The castle was probably built as a residence for knights in the service of the Freiherr of Attinghausen/Schweinsberg. Very little is known of the early history of the castle, though much of it is tied with the fortunes of the Attinghausen/Schweinsberg family. On 1 May 1351, Rudolf Brun of Zurich and Johans von Attinghausen signed an alliance that brought Zurich into the growing Swiss Confederation. In 1353 they received the a fief that included the Imperial customs post at the Castle of Rudenz and became the Rector over Valais. However, in 1358 Johann died. Traditionally, it was believed that he died during an insurrection, which also destroyed the castle. However, more recent research indicates that he might have died of disease or while marching with his army. Johann's son, Jacob, was with the Pope in Avignon, but did not return to Uri or died while returning. Two of his cousins, Werner and Johann von Simpeln probably took over the Attinghausen lands and Attinghausen Castle in 1359. However, they both died soon thereafter, either of disease or in the 1360 fire that destroyed the castle. The Lords of Rudenz then inherited the Attinghausen lands and Schweinsberg Castle passed through a number of owners. In the 16th century the castle was owned by the Zick family of Attinghausen. In 1617 it was given to Lieutenant Pompeus Tresch as a reward for his valor in battle. Following the Tresch family, it was owned by Johann Jakob von Beroldingen. At some point in its history it may have been owned by Attinghausen Nunnery. After passing through a number of other owners, in the late 19th century the Tresch family reacquired the castle and continue to own it to the present. Castle site The castle is a rectangular tower of irregular, unfinished stone. The upper most level is partially wooden with stone walls reaching the roof on two and a half sides. It is about and high. The walls at ground level are between thick. Inside the tower is another stone wall, running parallel to the west wall, that reaches to the roof. This wall, together with the upper level stone walls creates a fortified inner room of about . The original entrance was located part way up the tower on the north side and was reached by a wooden staircase. Today the main entrance is on the south at ground level and the high entrance is a window. The tower was probably surrounded by a wall and ditch, though no traces of either remain. The ground floor was used for storage. The next floor was the original entrance and was used as a great hall. It was decorated with murals of the Crucifixion and hunting scenes that were painted around 1480. Unfortunately, many of these murals have mostly deteriorated, and the room is now used as a kitchen.

Located in southern Washington Township, the district occupies the site of what was once the family farm of Oliver Johnson. Born on the present site of the Indiana State Fairgrounds,Vanderstel, Sheryl D. \\"Johnson Woods\\". The Encyclopedia of Indianapolis. Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1994. Johnson grew up in a pioneer family that lived on the edge of the state capital city.Barrows, Robert G. \\"Histories of Indianapolis\\". The Encyclopedia of Indianapolis. Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1994. Upon attaining adulthood, he bought property a short distance to the west, to which he moved in 1846. Here, he built a larger farmhouse in 1862,Indiana Historic Sites and Structures Inventory. Washington Township, Marion County Interim Report. Indianapolis: Indiana Landmarks, 1991, 132-135. and he tilled the soil for most of the rest of his life. As Indianapolis grew northward, it reached the Johnson farm in the early twentieth century; the aged farmer and his sons saw the city's growth as an opportunity for financial gain, and in 1905 they announced the platting of of their property into individual lots. They chose an advantageous time to sell their property; as the new residents began to build their homes, an interurban railway was built along College Avenue on the district's western side that connected downtown with Broad Ripple. Many prosperous businessmen were attracted by the development's large lots and wooded streets; the city annexed Oliver Johnson's Woods in 1912, and by the outbreak of World War II, the streets were filled with large houses built in a wide variety of architectural styles. These early residents came from many different ethnicities: European immigrants were becoming more prosperous and leaving their ethnic enclaves, and new neighborhoods such as Oliver Johnson's Woods appealed to them. Among the neighborhood's leading residents was a colony of Jews of German descent. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs Houses in the district generally feature architectural styles that were popular in the early twentieth century, such as the Colonial Revival, the Tudor Revival, the Arts and Crafts, the American Foursquare, and the Prairie School. Many of the district's Colonial Revival houses were constructed by William F. Nelson, who acted both as architect and as general contractor for these projects. Standing out from all other houses in the district is the original Johnson farmhouse; now known as the Johnson-Denny House, it originally faced Central Avenue, but its new owner relocated it to face Park Avenue while the surrounding land was being developed in 1919. Other buildings were once located around the house, but they have not survived. Today, Oliver Johnson's Woods is surrounded by the Meridian-Kessler neighborhood, and it remains the wooded middle-class neighborhood that it was originally planned to be. In 1979, the Johnson-Denny House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places; it was seen as eligible because of its place in local history and because of its well- preserved historic architecture.

Life He was son of the Rev. Henry Savage. He matriculated as a pensioner on 6 October 1817 at Trinity College, Dublin, obtaining a scholarship in 1822, and graduating B.A. in the autumn of 1824. On leaving the university he held for some time in Dublin a position under the Irish government. Savage was in 1856 appointed editor of The Examiner in succession to John Forster, and moved to London. He remained editor for around three years. He died at Torquay, after a prolonged illness, on 1 May 1872. Works His first novel The Falcon Family, or Young Ireland, appeared in 1845, at the moment when the physical force party were just beginning to secede from the Repeal Association. It was a caustic attack on the seceders. His second work, The Bachelor of the Albany, which was published in 1847, proved to be his best known. In 1849 Savage brought out a three-volume novel, called My Uncle the Curate, and in 1852 another entitled Reuben Medlicott, or the Coming Man. His fifth story was a novelette, called Clover Cottage, or I can't get in, which, dramatised by Tom Taylor under the title of Nine Points of the Law, as a comedietta in one act, was first performed at the Olympic on 11 April 1859, with Mrs. Stirling and Addison in the two chief parts. In 1855 he edited, in two volumes with notes and a preface, Richard Lalor Sheil's Sketches, Legal and Political, which had appeared as a serial in the New Monthly Magazine, under the editorship of Thomas Campbell. In 1870 he brought out his sixth and last novel, entitled The Woman of Business, or the Lady and the Lawyer. Family He was twice married. By his first wife, Olivia, daughter of Olivia Owenson and niece of Lady Morgan, to whom the novelist dedicated his Bachelor of the Albany, he had an only son, who died in youth. By his second wife, a daughter of Thomas Hutton of Dublin, he had no children.

Baer was head of the photography department at the San Francisco Art Institute, and known for his photographs of San Francisco's \\"Painted Ladies\\" Victorian houses, California buildings, landscape and seascapes.Obituary at SF Gate, November 11, 1995 Baer learned basic commercial photography in Chicago and honed his skills as a World War II United States Navy combat photographer. Returning to civilian life, over the next few years he developed into \\"one of the foremost architectural photographers in the world,\\"Baer, 1988 receiving important commissions from premier architects in post-war Central California. In the early 1970s, influenced by a friendship with Edward Weston, Baer began to concentrate on his personal landscape art photography. During the last decades of the 20th century, he also became a sought-after instructor in various colleges and workshops teaching the art of landscape photography. Early life and education Morley Baer's parents encouraged him in an active outdoor life growing up in Toledo. He attended the University of Toledo in 1934 and later transferred to the University of Michigan from where he graduated in 1937 with a BA in English. Continuing on there, he earned an MA in Theater Arts in 1938. Baer soon found a dull but well-paying job in the advertising office of the Chicago department store Marshall Field's. Dissatisfied, he apprenticed as a low-paid menial assistant, at a greatly reduced salary, to a Michigan Avenue commercial photography company. He shortly was photographing in the field, and developing and printing photographs.[https://oac.cdlib.org/search?style=oac4&ff;=0&institution;=UC+Santa+Cruz&query;=Morley+Baer&x;=15&y;=7 Along with two associates, Baer was sent on assignment to Colorado in 1939. He had seen an exhibition of Edward Weston's photographs at the Katherine Kuh Galleries in January of that year, and became enamored at the sparse elegance of Weston's black-and-white prints. He extended his trip west to California to meet Weston at his studio in Carmel-by-the-Sea. The two did not meet, but Baer made the most of the trip by visiting San Francisco, the Monterey Peninsula, and Carmel. Military photographer Although he returned to Chicago, he already had applied for Art Center School while in San Francisco but his plans were derailed by the onset of World War II. In 1941 he enlisted in the Navy almost immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor and went through the Navy photo school at Pensacola, where he learned to adjust to its stereotyped approach to producing photographs. Baer graduated, commissioned as an ensign, and was transferred to Norfolk for a series of stories on the Atlantic Theater of operations. His duties included public relations, aircraft recon, editorial assignments, teaching, and combat photography from aircraft and carriers. Accompanied by a writer, Baer covered military operations in North Africa, southern France, Brazil, and the Caribbean Sea. In 1945 he was assigned to the operational Naval Aviation Photographic Unit, commanded by the photographer Edward Steichen. Working under a variety of terrain, sea, and weather conditions, ever changing light, and new environments in physically demanding activities, he made dozens of photographs a day, and perfected his technical and compositional photographic skills. When discharged from the Navy in 1946 he was a complete and confident professional photographer. Karman, James, 2002 Post-war years In 1945 Baer, now a civilian in San Francisco, met up again with Frances Manney, a young woman awaiting admission to Stanford University, who previously had hired Baer as her photography tutor during his brief time in Norfolk. The two married and investing their dwindling funds, established a commercial photography business in a small store-front studio in Carmel in 1946. \\"Morley Baer, photography workshop\\", Cambria, CA, '93, by Christopher Purcell Baer had no difficulty discovering opportunities aplenty in the booming post-war building trades. In dire need of competent photographers to illustrate their projects, builders and architects vied to hire the Baer team. As his reputation grew, he had as much work as he could handle. His published architectural photographs from that time testify to his active professional career. His clients were among the more noted Bay Area architectural firms.Olmstead, 1968Andersen, 1980 Although Baer had briefly fulfilled his long-held dream of meeting Edward Weston, they had met only briefly. So, through a Weston friend sometime in 1947, Baer learned of an Ansco view camera for sale, a camera he had previously used in Chicago and was very familiar with its capabilities. Able to buy it for the then princely sum of $90, it became the camera he most used for the rest of his life. Although he had others for some assignments, the Ansco was the instrument with which he made his most memorable photographs. It became almost an extension of his photographic seeing and visualization in his later fine art landscape work.Baer, 2002 Morley and Frances became frequent visitors to Edward Weston's home/studio in Carmel's Wildcat Hill and with whom they had a close friendship until Weston's death in 1958. For the production of Weston's monumental photographic Portfolios I and II Morley worked closely with Edward's son Brett Weston in making the prints, while Frances did the spotting of the finished prints. Besides being helpful to Weston, this association greatly benefited Baer's career in the world of fine-art photography. Through Weston he met most of the prominent West Coast photographers. The more noted among them earlier had formed Group f/64 in San Francisco; its members included Weston, Ansel Adams, Imogen Cunningham, Willard Van Dyke, and Henry Swift, among others. Baer again met up with Steichen in 1950 when he and Frances made a trip to New York. Although Steichen carefully examined the photographic portfolio Baer showed him, he was less than enthralled by its subject matter – their photographic sensitivities were vastly different. Adams, 1985 Bay Area residency Finding attractive work opportunities in the San Francisco area in the early fifties, the Baers sold their house on Carmelo Avenue in Carmel and re-located to Berkeley. Baer soon was making a name for himself as a leading architectural photographer performing portfolio work for architects and interior designers while freelancing for housing design magazines. Ansel Adams recruited him as an instructor at the San Francisco Art Institute, then under the direction of Minor White. When White left for the East Coast in 1953, Baer became Head of the Institute's Photography Department. In 1953 the Baers moved into a 1920s era house in Greenwood Common that had been renovated by architect Rudolph Schindler for its owner, who sold it in 1951 to William Wurster, who, in turn, sold it in 1953 to Baer.Lowell, 2009 Baer soon became very active in neighborhood affairs. Showing their lifetime appreciation for landscaping, the Baers hired Lawrence Halprin to design their outdoor areas. Baer rapidly became a sought-after architectural photographer for noted architects, including Craig Edwards, the firm of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM), Charles Willard Moore, and William Turnbull, Jr..Fink, 1980 Baer's photographs of buildings by Bernard Maybeck, Greene and Greene, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Julia Morgan are considered important today in understanding American architecture and design in the first half of the 20th century. 1960s onwards Through the influence of Nathaniel A. Owings, SOM hired Baer to photograph US consulate buildings being constructed throughout Western Europe. The Baers and their young son moved to Spain for two years. Baer found time to produce personal work by photographing out-of-the-way locations in Andalucia. The family traveled the country in a VW bus in which they camped as necessary, freeing them to go where they pleased. These photographs led to Baer's first one-man exhibition at San Francisco's M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in 1959 and his first published portfolio. When he returned to California, SOM hired Baer for a large photographic survey that lasted through the mid-1960s. During this time Baer also was the architectural photographer for the pioneering Sea Ranch, California in Gualala. He contributed work for the 1965 Sierra Club publication Not Man Apart, which also included entries from artists such as Robinson Jeffers, Dorothea Lange, and Beaumont Newhall.Jeffers, 1965 Jeffers exerted a strong influence on Baer's subsequent thinking and artistic sensitivities.Olmstead, 1968In fact, Baer was so impressed by Jeffers that he began forming the idea of combining his photographs of the Sur coastline with Jeffers' somber but expansive poetry. Finally getting around to this project in his last years, it resulted in the book \\"Stones of the Sur\\", brilliantly curated by James Karman. The dynamic juxtaposition of photographs and poetry combined to reveal, in a mild paraphrasing of Karman, \\"much about the meaning and mystery of the world\\". In 1966 the American Institute of Architects gave Baer their Architectural Photography Award. Morley Baer, 1995 by Brigitte Carnochan The success of Not Man Apart led to a later assignment as the principal photographer for the 1968 publication, Here Today. Subsequently he was selected as the only photographer for the 1978 book Painted Ladies, a collection of color photographs of the more stately San Francisco Victorian houses, Baer's first major color photography project.Pomada, 1978 Burlingame Southern Pacific Railroad Station trackside facade, 1971 HABS image by Baer. Burlingame Station, tower on trackside, Burlingame, California, 1971 HABS image by Baer. Burlingame Station, streetside facade with tower, 1971 HABS image by Baer. Garrapata In 1965 the Baers built a second home and studio, designed by Bay Area Modernist architect William Wurster, south of Carmel near the Big Sur coast with dramatic shore and ocean views. Wurster designed the two-story house with its river-stone facade, creating an organic building blending with the surrounding rocks and cliffs, and sometimes referred to as 'The Stone House.' It commanded a striking view of Garrapata Beach and Soberanes Point with its long stretches of surf and beach. Unfortunately, Frances never felt comfortable in the Stone House, feeling it cold, damp, and isolated and continued to live in Berkeley while Morley used the Garrapata residence as his combination home and studio. The remote coastal location brought Baer into intimate contact with the primal natural elements of wind, water, light, and rocks at the cliffs and beach, an environment in which he did much of his best work. However his photographic eye seldom left architecture. He recounts standing on a sidewalk in downtown Monterey waiting for his equipment to dry after a heavy rainstorm, when he began studying the surrounding classic Monterey buildings. Becoming increasingly interested in their clean lines, he resolved to photograph them. This began his late 60s/early 70s Monterey Historical Series which resulted in his book 'Adobes in the Sun'.Baer, 1972 With Garrapata as his base, Baer photographed throughout the West but mostly in Central California. He exhibited his landscape portfolios of classical black-and-white photographs, wrote or contributed to several books of photography, and became an instructor in photography workshops. In the early 1970s, Baer joined Adams and other prominent central California fine art photographers to found the Friends of Photography in Carmel, which organized yearly photographic student workshops at Carmel's Sunset Center and at the Julia Morgan-designed Asilomar Conference Grounds. Those workshops inspired development of what became known as the West Coast style of landscape photography through the last decades of the 20th Century.Conger, Amy, 1981 He published two photography collections in 1973, 'Andalucia' and 'Garrapata Rock'. Along with his increasing success as a fine art landscape photographer, Baer continued with assignments as a commercial architectural photographer for several architect clients primarily throughout the Monterey Peninsula. He was the sole photographer for the exhibition, California Design 1910 in late 1974 at the Pasadena Conference Center; one of his landscape photographs graces the cover. Recalling his grandfather's accounts of his yearly journeys from Ohio to California, Morley was enamored by visions of California's golden hills and sea-swept coasts. So, when he read the poetic descriptions of the western lands by the early 20th writer, Mary Austin, he conceived the idea of matching some particularly lucid passages from her book, The Land of Little Rain, with some of his more appropriate photographs. Result was the 1979 book, Room and Time Enough.Baer, Morley, 1979 He teamed with Augusta Fink, the biographer of Mary Austin, to produce a synergistic combination of prose and photography into a paean to the Western landscape. Carmel In 1972, after the couple became temporarily estranged, the Baers sold the Greenwood Common house. Frances remained as an art teacher in the Bay Area. In 1979 they sold the Garrapata house, and Morley briefly moved to a smaller home in Carmel. In 1980, Baer was awarded the Rome Prize in Design and a fellowship at the American Academy in Rome, where he mainly photographed the fountains of Rome. Baer had an exhibition, appropriately titled \\"The Fountains of Rome\\", in May 1981 at the Bonnafont Gallery in San Francisco. He returned to his Carmel home/studio after the year in Rome, and reunited with Frances. The couple then bought a house/studio on Carmel Valley Road in 1985, where they lived the remainder of their lives. \\"Morley Baer\\", Monterey, CA, '94, by Christopher Purcell Photographic philosophies and techniques From the beginning of their relationship, both as husband and wife and as business partners, Morley and Frances Baer worked as a team. Their separate but personal photographic visions and techniques centered around careful composition of the subject matter, complete familiarity with their equipment and materials, and dedication to the art and profession of photography. Both believed that only the view camera – Morley with an 8x10, Frances with a 5x7 - allowed them to express their feelings about a photographic subject.Adams, 1980 Although devoted partners, the Baers were intense mutual competitors and had an arrangement for 'artistic rights' to a potential photograph discovered while driving the countryside — as Frances recounts in her chapter, \\"Rules of the Road\\" in 'California Plain'. It belonged to the person on whose side of the car the subject lay. > Whenever we are driving, subject matter on the left side of the road is the > domain of the driver, and the passenger has first dibs on everything on the > right side. Baer's overall approach to making a photograph was centered on uniting technical capabilities of his camera and lens with emotional feelings at the moment of making the photograph. He always would apply his 'strongest seeing,' to borrow a phrase from Edward Weston,Weston, 1991 to bring out what he saw as the dominant element in a scene. His photographs were always finely set up, some would say \\"tightly\\". Although he eschewed use of the term 'composition', he applied an admonition from Weston that \\"composition is just the strongest way of seeing\\". Indeed, along with that uncompromising admonishment, Morley held to an amplifying Weston dictum that \\"Photography as a creative expression ... must be seeing plus\\". Dr Jim Jordan http://www.antiochcollege.edu/news/obituaries/james-jim-william-jordan-former- faculty may have captured Baer's philosophy expressed by his photographs in his essay on Morley in his book (p 15 of the 'Light Years' essay), in that Baer finds universal themes in his subjects precisely because he has searched inwardly to relate to them on an intense visceral level, \\"The photograph itself is a kind of icon, an object in its own right that acts upon the emotional and intellectual relationship between the photographer and subject ...\\" Morley Baer's philosophy of art photography, and indeed of life itself, is exemplified in the work of several of his photographic assistants. Among them are Marco Zecchin,http://marcozecchin.com Patrick Jablonski,http://www.patrickjablonski.com Frank Long, and the late Erik Lauritzen.http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt796nc97p/ Lauritzen's own work is archived at UC Santa Cruz. Equipment Motivated by a strong sense of simplicity in equipment and technique learned from Edward Weston, and reinforced by his readings of Robinson Jeffers' sparse poetry for which he had sincere admiration, Baer reduced his photographic equipment to a compact minimum. With time and experience, he acquired the equipment and techniques that completely suited his photographic style. Once he had settled on a particular technique he rarely changed it. Baer used the same Ansco 8x10S view camera on an apparently flimsy but really very sturdy wood tripod for virtually all his serious photography. After fifty years of usage the Ansco had become almost an extension of his mind and eye; he could adjust its settings by feel alone while under his darkcloth and concentrating on his subject in the ground glass viewer. Eloquently, almost lovingly, he expresses his feelings towards the ancient Ansco in his Photographers Notes in The Wilder Shore. Morley Baer with his Ansco Camera, early 80s Morley Baer at work with his Ansco Camera, early 90s; by David Fullagar Baer designed a special metal carrying case, with a sturdy leather-strap handle, constructed for him by a Monterey metal worker. He replaced it only once during his career. The case held his camera, several lenses, film holders and other paraphernalia he needed in the field. With his camera on one shoulder, and the carrying case in the opposite hand, he was perfectly laterally balanced as he strode towards the subject of his photograph. Precise in his lens selection and use, Baer used a wide range of lens focal lengths from a 120 mm wide angle to a 19\\" (480 mm), what he called his 'long lens'. As his favorite lens he claimed that \\"It sees how I see the material.\\" Having a lens for almost every occasion was important since Baer did mostly contact prints of his 8x10 negatives where, besides being esthetically displeasing to him, cropping was not an option. Although owning a Navy surplus Saltzman 8x10 enlarger,John Sexton Tribute; Apogee Photo Magazine, late 1995 he rarely used it since contact prints were his preferred medium of expression – it's now a prized possession of one of his last assistants. He standardized his procedures to the extent possible, based on thorough testing for film exposure and development characteristics, changing them only when necessary. Darkroom techniques Baer developed his 8x10 negatives by inspection during the development process. While the development was well underway, he would briefly check his highlight densities with a dim green safelight and continued development until he obtained his desired densities. He developed early Isopan and later Super XX Black & White film in his variation of ABC Pyro. Although reluctant to use filters, Baer did so when necessary for effectively expressing the subject — as he described in technical entries in his several books. He seldom changed from his favorite film (Pyro) and print developers (Amidol),Adams, 1995 modifying them as materials evolved.Baer, Morley, 1979 Baer's explains his techniques for achieving the vivid colors of the subjects in Painted Ladies in a short article (P79). He decided that 'Eastman's Professional Ektachrome as the most amenable color material (this was late 70s). He had it processed by a professional laboratory and achieved the consistent fine results he sought. In his Photographer's Notes to The Wilder Shore (p151) he explains what he was trying to express in his photographs of the California landscape and his frequent use of color to achieve it. He continued with Professional Ektachrome film developed in a commercial developer but exposed at values he worked out in extensive testing to achieve the subdued colors he thought best expressed subtleties of the California landscape. With his varied Navy photography experience, his many years of study, and intimate knowledge of his equipment, materials and darkroom techniques, Baer was well-qualified to take on any photographic assignment that came along. That confidence also allowed him to concentrate on the photographic task at hand, \\"... to interpret and thus to fully realize the potential for maximum expression ...\\" in his photographs. In evaluating a potential photographic subject, Baer thought both in esthetic and organizational terms but also in the technical challenges he would face in actually making the photograph. His assistant once watched Baer as he stared at a subject tree muttering, 'I am looking at the Pyro in the tree trunks [for the negative] and the Amidol [for the print] in the leaves'. He already was thinking of the technical problems he would have to solve in exposing the negative to get the tones he wanted in the final print. Legacy Morley Baer died in 1995, in Monterey, California. His photographic archive was divided between personal work and architectural work. Film negatives that Baer felt represented his most significant work were given to the Special Collections of the University of California, Santa Cruz. His architecture photography archive, comprising mostly photographs of Stanford University buildings commissioned by the University or its architects, are housed at Stanford University. Morley Baer photographs, 1954-1977 All his other archives, containing numerous entries, are itemized in the Online Archive of California.https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt6q2nf55x/ A final tribute to Baer's artistry and emotional sensitivity may be abstracted from James Karman's assessment of the feelings of both Morley Baer and Robinson Jeffers toward the earth in general, and towards the Big Sur coast in particular. In his insightful and scholarly Introduction in \\"Stones of the Sur\\", he captures the magnetic attraction of the magnificent wild coastline for both Jeffers and Baer. > Baer shared the same sense of mystery — and the feeling of tenderness for > the mote that we inhabit, with its massive mountains and fathomless seas. > Like Jeffers, living on the edge of the continent, he was attuned to an > order and a scale of existence beyond the human; he sought to document the > sublime beauty, alien and austere at times, of the natural world, especially > that portion ... he encountered in his beloved Big Sur. Karman also touched on Baer's love of teaching Karman, James (2002), p 7. In addition to the formal institutions, in late Fall 1985, Baer created his own Annual Master Photographers Invitational Photographic workshops. He mailed invitations to selected students, scouted the venues, organized accommodations, and selected his preferred restaurants. He and his photographic assistant eagerly participated with the students, with Baer speculating on how he was viewing his subject and how he'd eventually create a printable negative. Afterwards, he hosted workshop students in his Carmel Valley home for his legendary English bangers BBQ. Afterwards, he leafed through his current portfolio, commenting on it and answering students' questions. Frances, hovering in the background, sometimes joined the group, obviously enjoying the sessions.

Other Central Collecting Points were located at Marburg, Wiesbaden and Offenbach, with the overall aim of giving restitution for the artifacts to their countries of origin. Lieutenant Craig Hugh Smyth was responsible for establishing the Munich Central Collecting Point in July 1945, converting former Nazi Party offices into a depot complete with photography studios and conservation labs. The depot's activities were directed by Herbert S. Leonard. The Munich Central Collecting Point mainly processed artwork from European museums and private collections, including Hitler's collection found at Altaussee. This included paintings, sculptures, metalwork and other objects. These restitution activities at Munich ceased in 1951. Archives of materials relating to the Munich Central Collecting Point are located in two repositories in the USA.

Located next to Tuality Community Hospital, the facility has nearly 800 parking spaces, including 13 that have charging stations for electric vehicles, as well as 35 secured spaces for bicycles that include showers and lockers. Opened in 2010, HITF also has of commercial space, which is mainly used by Portland Community College’s Hillsboro Center. The $16 million facility was a joint project between the city, Pacific University (as part of the university's Health Professions Campus), and Tuality Healthcare. History A parking garage was part of Pacific University’s original plan for the Health Professions Campus, and by September 2007 the city and school had received commitments for $7 million in funding out of a planned total price tag of $16 million. At that time, officials hoped to begin construction in 2009 on a four-level structure. In April 2009, the project was awarded $2.34 million in federal stimulus funds. In February 2009, the city approved a contract with Skanska USA for construction of the project with a bid of $13.1 million. Officials hoped to begin construction that spring, though the city still needed to find $4 million to fully fund the project. In August 2009, a groundbreaking ceremony was held at the construction site, featuring U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, Mayor Jerry Willey, state representative David Edwards, and Pacific University president Lesley Hallick, among others. Construction had already begun at the time of the ceremony. The city hoped to attain LEED silver certification for the project due to its environmentally friendly aspects, including solar power and space for bicycles. As of August 2009, the facility was expected to cost $16 million, with $7 million in funding coming from the city in the form of bonds backed by the lottery, $4.2 million in federal funds ($2.3 million of which were federal stimulus funds), about $1.6 million from Pacific, and the donation of the land by Tuality, valued at around $1.6 million. Hillsboro would own the facility, with Portland Community College signed on as a tenant for the first-floor commercial space. Construction was scheduled to begin in late July 2009 on what had been a parking lot for the hospital. At that time the project had secured all funding needed, and due to lower costs caused by the recession, the construction was to be completed in a single phase instead of several phases as had been originally planned. Besides the parking spaces, the project called for Bike Central, 15 electric vehicle charging stations, and of commercial space on the ground level. Additionally, the roof was to include solar panels and possibly wind turbines at a later time. On August 31, 2010, the facility officially opened with a ceremony that celebrated both its opening and the opening of the second building at the neighboring Health Professions Campus. Dignitaries at the event included Hillsboro mayor Willey, state senator Bruce Starr, and state representatives David Edwards and Chuck Riley. The facility actually opened in September. PCC moved its Hillsboro Education Center from near the Hatfield Government Center MAX station into the HITF in September 2010, and renamed it the Hillsboro Center. An indoor bicycle facility with secured parking for bicycles and showers opened in October 2010. In March 2011, the project was named one of nine finalists for the Daily Journal of Commerce’s top construction project for public buildings in the $15 to $50 million range, with the University of Oregon’s PK Park listed as another finalist in that category. The facility came in third in its category. Details The facility is located between Baseline and Washington streets and between Seventh and Eighth avenues in Downtown Hillsboro, a half block away from the Eighth Avenue MAX station. The thirteen ChargePoint charging stations at the HITF are from Coulomb Technologies and include features that allow users to reserve times, find open stations, and be notified when a charge is complete, all remotely. Power for the charging stations comes in part from the solar panel array situated on the roof of the structure. These panels came from SolarWorld’s local plant in the city. The concrete-and-steel structure has a brick veneer and stands five stories tall, with the fifth floor uncovered. HITF has 794 parking spaces total, as well as nearly of commercial space on the ground floor. Skanska USA built the structure for the city of Hillsboro, while LRS Architects did the design work and Catena Consulting Engineers provided engineering on the project. The facility was a joint project between the city, Pacific University, and Tuality Healthcare. Located inside the commercial space are BikeStation Hillsboro and Portland Community College’s Hillsboro Center. Hillsboro Center occupies of the commercial space and serves about 500 credit-seeking students each term and an additional 200 students learning English as a second language. BikeStation Hillsboro contains 35 secured bicycle lockers, showers and lockers, and a bicycle repair space that provides tools in about of space on the ground floor. Access to BikeStation requires a paid membership, with the program operated by Mobis Transportation.

Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway corridor between Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park in northwestern Wyoming. The location was initially occupied in the 1890s by the Snake River Military Station, part of a network of U.S. Army outposts for patrol and management of Yellowstone National Park in its early years under military administration. The outpost operated under Army control until 1906, when the land to the south of the Yellowstone boundary were turned over to the U.S. Forest Service, becoming Teton National Forest in 1908. The station became a stopping point for travelers between Jackson, Wyoming and Yellowstone, easily identifiable by the flags that flew over it. Flagg Ranch In 1910 the Flagg Ranch was established nearby by Edward S. Sheffield, who named the ranch after the old post's flags. Sheffield obtained a lease from the Forest Service and exploited hot springs along nearby Polecat Creek for bathing. Ed Sheffield was the brother of Ben Sheffield, who operated a dude ranch of his own, the Teton Lodge Resort near the Moran settlement in northern Jackson Hole. The Flagg Ranch grew along with the dude ranch and guest ranch industry as it developed in Jackson Hole, and by Sheffield's death in 1927 the Flagg Ranch was a fully equipped dude ranch. It was described as a stagecoach ride from Ashton, Idaho, the nearest point of connection to the Union Pacific Railroad line. Park Service concession In 1972 the section of Teton National Forest between Yellowstone and Grand Teton was transferred to the National Park Service as John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway, to be operated by Grand Teton. The Flagg Ranch became a Park Service concessioner with the transfer. The ranch has been operated by International Leisure Hosts, Ltd. since 1964.

Exchange programs do not necessarily exchange one individual for another individual of another country; rather, \\"exchange\\" refers to the exchange of cultural understanding created when an individual goes to another country. These programs can be regarded as a form of cultural diplomacy within the spectrum of public diplomacy. Exchange programs played a vital role in official and unofficial relations between the Soviet Union and the United States during the Cold War. Examples of cultural exchange programs include student exchanges, sports exchanges, and scholarly or professional exchanges, among many others. While many exchange programs are funded by the government, many others are private- sector organizations, either non-profit or for-profit.  History of US Cultural Program  One of the earliest cultural exchanges to be considered part of U.S. Public Diplomacy occurred when Nelson Rockefeller, named coordinator of Commercial and Cultural Affairs for the American Republics, encouraged journalists from Latin America to visit the United States in 1940 as part of the exchange of programs program with Latin America. Leading musicians from the region were subsequently invited during the decade to CBS's broadcasting studios in New York City in order to perform on the Viva America radio program for the State Department's Office for Coordination of Commercial and Cultural Relations (OCCCRBAR) and the Office of the Coordinator of Inter- American Affairs.Media Sound & Culture in Latin America. Editors: Bronfman, Alejanda & Wood, Andrew Grant. University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, PA, USA, 2012, p. 48-49 books.google.com See p. 48- 49 Following World War II, Senator J. William Fulbright introduced legislation for what would become the Fulbright Program in 1946. One of the most significant moments in the formalization of exchange programs as tools of American Foreign Policy came under U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower. In 1955, Eisenhower met with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev in Geneva. Soon after this meeting, Eisenhower said, \\"The subject that took most of my attention was the possibility of increased visits overseas by the citizens of one country into the territory of the other nation. In this subject there was the fullest possible agreement between the West and the Soviet Union\\". In 1959, the exchange programs aspect of the State Department was separated from the Public Affairs Bureau to form the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Relations. In 1961, Congress passed the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act (also known as Fulbright-Hays Act of 1961), mandating an increase in governmental programs to enhance mutual understanding between the people of the United States and other countries.  Cold War  Exchange Programs from the United States played a vital role during the Cold War with the Soviet Union. George Kennan, a key figure in the Cold War known as the father of containment, viewed culture as a way to decrease negative sentiments between countries. Examples of cultural exchange programs between the United States and the Soviet Union include theater, museum, and opera expositions. Although not political on the surface, cultural exchanges like these helped alleviate tensions and \\"humanize\\" the West in the eyes of the Soviets who witnessed them. In addition to Americans visiting the Soviet Union, approximately 50,000 Soviet citizens visited the United States, including writers, politicians, musicians, and other arts figures. Oleg Kalugin, former KGB general and head of KGB operations in the United States, noted that these exchange programs were a \\"Trojan Horse,\\" because they \\"eroded\\" the Soviet system.  Post-Cold War  In 1993, the Alliance for International Educational and Cultural Exchange (The Alliance) was created following the merger of the International Exchange Association and the Liaison Group for International Educational Exchange. This merger made The Alliance the central association for United States exchange programs. Today, The Alliance is composed of 76 non-governmental organizations. The Alliance's activities include formulating specific recommendations to support public policy regarding educational and cultural exchanges. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, but before the September 11 attacks, funding for exchange programs declined. The number of exchanges per year dropped from nearly 45,000 individuals to less than 30,000. The State Department recognizes a general lack of funding. While spending on traditional diplomacy amounted to $25 billion in 2002 and intelligence spending was $30 billion the same year, spending on exchange programs was at $232 million, a decline from the $349 million spent on exchange programs in 1993. As of 2003, exchange programs sponsored by the United States Government have brought roughly 700,000 foreigners to the United States. The ECA indicates that at least 200 heads of state (both current and previous) have received an education in the United States from one of these exchange programs. Additionally, approximately 1,500 high ranking ministers have similarly participated in such programs.  Significance to US Foreign Policy  Individuals brought to the United States or who experience Americans abroad through cultural exchange programs develop a lasting impression of both American culture and the government of the United States. Those millions who have been educated in the United States may develop a deep-rooted appreciation for American culture. Many of these individuals enter into positions that directly affect the foreign policy of the United States, such as Margaret Thatcher and Anwar Sadat.  Trends  Following 9/11, there has been an increase in U.S. Government support for cultural exchange programs in the Middle East. In 2003, for example, 25% of governmental funding for cultural exchange programs was targeted at Arab and Muslim countries. This increase in targeted spending led to the creation of the Partnership for Learning (P4L), which \\"provides scholarships for secondary school students from countries with significant Muslim populations to spend up to one academic year in the United States. The program is vital to expanding communication between the people of the U.S. and the partner countries in the interest of promoting mutual understanding and respect\\".  Examples of Exchange Programs = Critical Language Scholarship Program  The Critical Language Scholarship (CLS) Program is a program offered by the State Department as part of the National Security Language Initiative. It offers language students of those languages deemed \\"critical\\" to the needs of the United States full scholarship to live and study in a target country. Students live in host family environments and are completely immersed in the target country's language and culture. Students are expected to continue their study of the target country's language and culture following completion of the program.  Fulbright Program  The Fulbright Program, operating in more than 155 countries, serves to increase understanding between United States citizens and citizens of foreign countries. Since its inception in 1946, the program has counted over 114,000 people from the United States and 186,000 citizens of other countries. In 2010, The Fulbright Program received $253.8 million from the United States government, while the total of foreign contributions to the program totaled $68.5 million.  International Military Education and Training Program  The International Military Education and Training Program (IMET) was created following the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. It is funded via the International Affairs budget of the United States Department of State, though is used by the Department of Defense. Its two goals are to increase regional stability and to increase the understanding democratic principles and human rights among foreign militaries and civilians. To these ends, foreign students are exposed to U.S. military procedures and general American culture. This program includes over 2,000 courses and offers instruction at nearly 150 military installations.  International Visitor Leadership Program  The International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP), formerly the International Visitor Program, seeks to bring promising or current leaders of foreign countries to the United States in hopes of building lasting ties. Colin Powell estimated in 2003 that 39 of the then current heads of state formerly participated in the IVLP.  Peace Corps  The Peace Corps is a cultural exchange program run by the United States government. Founded in 1960 following then-Senator John F. Kennedy's challenge to University of Michigan students to serve the country by living and working in foreign countries, the Peace Corps serves as a vital federal agency for promoting understanding of foreign cultures among Americans and of American culture among foreigners in troubled regions of the world. Over 200,000 Americans have volunteered in the Peace Corps since its inception in 139 countries.  People to People Ambassador Program  Founded as part of the U.S. Information Agency by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956 to ease tensions during the Cold War, the People to People initiative offered non- governmental contacts between people of different countries. Following Eisenhower's departure from office, the program was privatized and incorporated in the state of Missouri. People to People provides four core programs, including Student Ambassadors, Sports Ambassadors, Leadership Programs, and Citizen Ambassador Programs. More than 500,000 people have participated in these programs.

They are most notable for their predatory skills and strength. They are ambush predators that are able to capture and eat other insects much greater than their own size. Physical characteristics A. andreae have dark brown, shiny bodies covered in white hair. The workers are a little less than 3mm in length, and the queen is slightly more than 5mm in length.Guerrero R., Delabie J., Dejean A. (2010) \\"Taconomic contribution to the aurita group of the ant genus Azteca (Formicidae: Dolichoderinae).\\" J. Hym. Res. 19 (1):51-65 Habitat The ants live in the hollow internodes, or the spaces in between nodes on the plant stem, of select plant species. When the queens start a new colony, they apparently limit their colonies to Cecropia trees. They will inhabit multiple different species of tree, but they have a preference for Cecropia obtusa. Up to 8350 workers live in each tree. The queens initially start the colonies inside of the tree, but the ants will eventually build external carton nests.Dejean A., Leroy C., Corbara B., Roux O., Céréghino R., Orivel J., Boulay R. (2010) \\"Arboreal ants use the 'Velcro Principle' to capture very large prey.\\" . PLoS ONE 5(6): e11331. The ants will also build their nests near the wasp species Polybia rejecta in order to protect the nests from other predators. The wasp is highly aggressive towards any mammal or other predator that approaches their nest. Plant-ant symbiosis Often, the ants will not only receive housing from the plant; they will eat extrafloral nectar and food bodies that the plant provides. In return, the plant receives security from herbivores that may eat the plant, because the ants hunt on the plant and eat many of the plant’s predators. This symbiosis benefits both the plant and ants. Predatory behavior A. andreae use ambush predation to hunt insects many times their own size. The ants will actually position themselves side-by- side next to each other underneath the edge a leaf. There, they are invisible from above except for their mandibles, which hang outside the edge waiting for prey. Many times, the ants will occupy each leaf of the plant. When an insect lands on the leaf, three to ten of the closest ants immediately attack and drive the prey to the leaf margin, where more ambushing ants will congregate and attack. Large prey was only captured if on the edge of the leaf, because the ants use their specialized legs to hold onto the velvety surface underneath ‘’C. obtusa’’ leaves. This mechanism essentially acts like Velcro, with the many small hooks on the legs of the ant gripping onto the velvet of the underside of the leaf. Because only the bottom of the leaf has this surface, the ants can only really capture prey when they are holding onto the leaf from the underside. This is the main factor that allows the ants to capture such massive prey. After catching their prey, they will either start tearing it to shreds on the spot or take it back to the colony and cut it up into smaller pieces. In an experiment by Alain Dejean et al. (2010), the ants captured more prey when hunting on C. obtusa than any other plant. The proposed explanation for this was the enhanced gripping power resulting from the Velcro-like mechanism that was absent on all the other plants. In addition, the research team tested the limits of the ants’ strength. They placed a weight on a thread, which they introduced to an ant that immediately grabbed on to the thread with its mandibles. An individual ant held onto weights up to eight grams, or 5.714 times the ant’s weight. Collectively, they were observed to capture a locust that weighed 18.61 grams, or 13,350 times the average weight of a single worker. This is one of the largest feats of strength documented in the entire animal world.

History CEW was founded in 1954 as a social organization for female executives working in the beauty industry. In 1975, the group expanded, and began focusing on the recognition of the career achievements of women working in the industry. By 1985, CEW established itself as a professional network, offering seminars, speakers, and mentoring to aid its members in career development. Organization CEW's membership is now around 9,500, and includes women and men. CEW's members span entry-level to high-ranking executives of beauty companies or related businesses. Its lineup of programming for its members includes career workshops, networking events, online mentoring, a beauty career center, speaker series, news forums and industry newsletters. Award programs CEW has become well known for its recognition programs. One, the Achiever Awards, are presented to individuals who have demonstrated \\"strong leadership\\" in the industry. Previous winners of this award include Linda Wells, the editor in chief of Allure magazine; Leslie Blodgett, CEO of mineral cosmetic company Bare Escentuals; Lisa Price, founder of African American hair care company Carol's Daughter; Gina Drosos, Global Head of Beauty at Procter & Gamble; and Alex Keith, an executive with P&G;'s beauty sector. CEW is also known for its Beauty Awards, where cosmetic, fragrance, skin care, hair care and body care products of various categories are judged for quality and innovation by CEW's members. After a selection of finalist products is announced, the final winning products (and companies) are honored at a gala event in New York City. Many influential cosmetic executives, journalists, and celebrities attend this event, and a CEW Beauty Award is widely recognized as the most prestigious honor a company can receive for its products. Philanthropy In 2001, the CEW Foundation began a program called \\"Cancer and Careers,\\" designed to provide support, education, and inspiration to cancer patients and survivors who are beginning or developing careers, as well as supporting newly diagnosed members of the workforce. Cancer and Careers focuses on supporting those affected by cancer in any industry, not strictly the beauty industry.

It had no clear winner and therefore did not decide the war.Philippe Contamine (directeur), Des origines à 1715, Presses universitaires de France, Paris, 1992, in André Corvisier (directeur), Histoire militaire de la France, , p 211 Insurgency of the Vassal countries Philip the Good had supported and even hosted Louis XI during his dispute with his father Charles VII. Still, or possibly even because he knew him that well after having lived for four years at his court, Louis XI resented the ambitions of Philip, who relentlessly expanded his duchy and behaved like a king in his own right. Louis XI had been King of France for four years already when Philip the Good, henceforth represented by his son Charles the Bold, Count of Charolais, allied with John II, Duke of Bourbon and Francis II, Duke of Brittany. Together they assembled an army that was considered strong enough to extort independence from Louis XI. Preliminary skirmishes Louis XI was backed up by Gaston IV, Count of Foix, the big cities, and all provinces (like Languedoc, Normandy, Champagne, Dauphiné, and others). His army grew rapidly and enforced Picardy's border to Burgundy. He put the defence of this border into the hands of Joachim Rouault, sent Charles, Count of Maine (his uncle) with twelve thousand soldiers against the ruler of Brittany and took the rest of his army (including the Scottish Guard) in April against the Bourbons. After he had conquered Moulins the Duke of Bourbon and other members of the League of the Public Weal signed a peace treaty on the King's conditions. The Burgundians arrived at the end of May in Champagne and reached Saint-Denis on 5 July. Not meeting any resistance they marched further and eventually attacked Paris. Brittany's army arrived on 13 July at Beaugency and intended to join forces with the Burgundians and to attack the King's army with a force of 35,000 men. Confronted with an invasion of Champagne and an attack on Paris at the same time, Louis XI split his army. His infantry and artillery kept marching toward Burgundy but he went north while Paris was already surrounded by enemies. Eventually he and his uncle, the comte du Maine, attacked Brittany's army from two sides and successfully hindered it from fusing with the Burgundians.Michel Rimboud. La bataille de Montlhéry - 1465. En ligne , consulté le 17 décembre 2006, p 78 On the night of 14–15 July the army of Louis XI rejoined the forces led by his uncle. Together they prepared for battle. The battle After a hard march which left parts of his army behind, Louis XI and his men arrived by dawn at Étampes. The King had 15,000 soldiers at his side, mainly cavalry. He was facing an enemy who had 20,000 men and substantial artillery. The King's men were determined to battle but their enemies weren't. The artillery took their toll among the King's lines but his soldiers stood their ground. During the following battle many fighters on both sides sought duels in the middle of the area between both armies, trying to distinguish themselves.Paul Murray Kendall. Louis XI, la bataille de Monthléry, extrait de Louis XI. Paris : Fayard. Disponible en ligne . Version consultée : 27/03/2002, le 17 décembre 2006. Also, single groups on both sides went occasionally forward, seeking combat, but returned to their original places once they had had their fights. At 14 o'clock Louis XI decided to march forward. Pierre de Brézé who held the right wing of the Royal Army would go first and then Louis would attack the centre of the enemy's army while his was uncle should attack at last. Pierre de Brézé managed to break through the lines and in the course of the subsequent disorder Louis XI in his turn attacked the heart of the enemy army. When Pierre de Brézé fell in combat, his enraged men annihilated everybody who stood in their way. However, the men under the command of his uncle didn't do so well and spoilt the victory by effectively avoiding direct contact with the enemy. The Count of Maine was eventually hunted by his counterparts, led by Charles the Bold himself. Instead of a victory, Louis XI encountered chaos. He was even thrown off his horse. Finally his enemies retreated after all, but his own forces were too scattered and in no condition to pursue them. The Count of Maine also escaped from his pursuers. Be that as it may, at the end of the day Louis XI had inflicted enough losses on Charles the Bold's army for the king's army to reach Paris without mishap, though leaving his adversary master of the battlefield. Eventually, Brittany's army and other members of the League of the Public Weal rejoined the Burgundian forces and together besieged the French capital (from 19 August 1465).

The deposits in which this skull were found included elephant, rhinoceros, horse, and bovid fossil remains and came from the travertines belonging to the second half of the last (Eemian) interglacial period. The estimated age of the remains is between 150,000 and 120,000 years. The remains' characteristics typical of early Neanderthals include the size of the brow ridges, the long and low brain case, and the strong chinless lower jaw.  Ehringsdorf H skull  Ehringsdorf H skull cap, biological age undeterminedhttps://www.nespos.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=29887312 In 1928, German anthropologist Franz Weidenreich published Der Schädelfund von Weimar-Ehringsdorf, (the skull find from Weimar-Ehringsdorf) where he described the Ehringsdorf H (or Ehringsdorf 9) skull-cap as that of an adult female. He suggested that the frontal area of the remains showed evidence of being struck, which led to speculation that the subject was murdered. In addition, he determined that the lack of a cranial base meant the skull had been opened for the purpose of extracting the brain. The remains, however, were so fragmentary that little attention was paid to this opinion. Based on the fusing of the Ehringsdorf H skull and small muscular traces on the bones, Weidenreich suggested the remains to be of a female of around 20–30 years old. The skull, like the ones found before it, showed distinct ancient (pre-300 ka) attributes. There were, however, certain cranial features that appeared similar to that of anatomically modern humans, particularly of the occipital bone. The skull was abnormal in that it bulged out more in left hemisphere than in the right. Weidenreich thinks this happened post-mortem, in the layer in which the skull was found. Weidenreich also considered variations in the thickness of the skull peculiar. The Ehringsdorf endo-exocranial different is 4.6,, remarkably low for Neanderthals. Scottish anthropologist Arthur Keith made a study of the skull in 1931, concluding that it belonged to an individual less than 20 years old.

He was the elder son of Malatesta IV Malatesta and Elisabetta da Varano. In 1405 he married Battista da Montefeltro. He was nicknamed \\"the inept\\" due to his lack of courage and, differently from most of the male members of the family, he did not prove skilled in the art of war. In 1413, together with his father, he took part in the failed attack to Capodimonte, near Ancona. In 1416 he was at the battle of Sant'Egidio, collaborating with his cousin Carlo I Malatesta. They were both taken as prisoners. Freed, Galeazzo followed his cousin in other battles until 1429, the year of the deaths of both his father and Carlo I. Galeazzo subsequently became lord of Pesaro. In 1430 he supported a rebellion against his kinsman, Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta. In 1431 he was ousted from Pesaro together with his brother Carlo, due to his poor government, and took refuge in Venice. After a series of battles against the Papal States, he was able to return in Pesaro in 1433. In 1433 he hired Federico III da Montefeltro to defend Pesaro and Fossombrone against his cousin Sigismondo Pandolfo from Rimini. Although he was able to keep his territories, and overwhelmed by the debts made to hire other condottieri, in 1444 he sold Pesaro to Alessandro Sforza in exchange of 20,000 florins. Two years later he gave Fossombrone to Federico da Montefeltro, for 13,000 florins. This caused the Pope to excommunicate him, since he had sold two towns which were nominally under papal rule. In 1448 he made peace with his cousins, Sigismondo Pandolfo and Domenico Malatesta, who pushed him to attack Pesaro. However, Galeazzo's attempt was thwarted by the intervention of Florence. He later lived in Florence, where he died in 1461.

He is a member of the San Diego City Council representing District 5. He was elected in June 2012 and re-elected in June 2016. Kersey served as council president pro tem from 2016 to 2017. He was a Republican until 2019 when he left the party to become an independent politician. Personal life Mark Kersey is a native of Columbus, Ohio and moved to the San Diego area in 2001. Kersey attended Northwestern University and the UCLA Anderson School of Management. He is a telecommunications analyst with and formerly maintained his own consulting firm. He lives in Black Mountain Ranch. Past candidacy Kersey unsuccessfully ran for the Solana Beach City Council in 2004. Kersey's candidacy was supported by the Beach and Bluff Conservancy, a local homeowners group that supported building seawalls to protect their property. Their political action committee spent $18,800 in his behalf during his unsuccessful effort to win a seat on the Solana Beach City Council. During the race for Solana Beach City Council, Kersey had to retract claims that several people had endorsed him after those individuals stated that they, in fact, had not given him their endorsement. This factored into the decision of the Solana Beach Firefighters Association to pull its endorsement of Kersey, as well. In 2008 he was the president of San Diego Young Republicans and was elected to the San Diego County Republican Central Committee.Results from 2008 San Diego Republican Central Committee, Assembly District 74 election from the League of Women Voters San Diego City Council In 2011 Kersey announced he would run for San Diego City Council in the 2012 election. He was part of a coordinated three-person slate supported by the local Republican Party in an attempt to gain a Republican majority on the nine-member board. He ran unopposed for the District 5 seat being vacated by retiring councilmember Carl DeMaio. District 5 includes the neighborhoods of Black Mountain Ranch, Carmel Mountain Ranch, Rancho Bernardo, Rancho Encantada, Rancho Peñasquitos, Sabre Springs, San Pasqual Valley, Scripps Ranch, and Torrey Highlands. He was elected in the June primary by receiving more than 50% of the vote. Kersey took office December 3, 2012. He chairs the Infrastructure Committee, is vice chair of the Economic Development and Intergovernmental Relations Committee, and is a member of the Budget and Finance Committee and Charter Reform Committee. Kersey is also the City's representative to the California League of Cities. Kersey has been called San Diego's \\"open data and infrastructure guy.\\" Kersey was elected to a second term in June 2016. In December 2016, Kersey was appointed Council President Pro Tem. He served in this position until December 2017, when he was succeeded by Barbara Bry. In April 2019, Kersey declared that he was leaving the Republican Party to become an independent, stating that he would work toward bipartisan solutions to the City's issues during the remaining two years of his term. Infrastructure As chair of the Infrastructure Committee, Kersey spearheaded a plan to address the City of San Diego's approximately $2 billion backlog of infrastructure projects. The plan called for assessments of city infrastructure, streamlining of processes, gathering of neighborhood input and the creation of a long-term infrastructure investment plan. With Kersey's leadership, the city completed its first-ever comprehensive sidewalk assessment as well as its first multi-year capital plan, which identified $1.7 billion in unfunded infrastructure projects over the next five years. Kersey also sponsored an ordinance to create a neighborhood input policy which was approved in July 2013. The policy formalized community input as part of the infrastructure prioritization process. Open data Kersey has pushed an open data initiative to \\"increase accountability and spur innovation\\" by putting the City's data online for the public. Kersey co-authored a draft open data policy and voted to create an ad-hoc committee to review and develop a formal policy to be adopted by the City of San Diego. The final policy was approved by the Council on December 16, 2014. Kersey also proposed creating a centralized communications point for San Diego City services, known as a 3-1-1 system. Kersey said 3-1-1 would be a number people could call if they have potholes on their street, broken traffic lights or spot water leaks in the city. Other actions In September 2013, he sponsored an ordinance to streamline the permit process, meant to help reduce costs and the time associated with completing city construction projects.

He studied sociology in Amsterdam. At present he is a researcher at Utrecht University, affiliated with the Amsterdam School for Social Science Research (ASSR). Academic Background In the 1960s, Wouters studied sociology at the University of Amsterdam with Professor Joop Goudsblom. Wouters wrote his dissertation Informalization about the obvious changes of the western customs and manners in the 20th century. He describes the changing behavior of different generations and summarizes this in his theory of informalization. The question about, how these changes in manners and regulations of emotions can be interpreted and explained is in its core the same that Norbert Elias addressed in his most important work The Civilizing Process (Über den Prozess der Zivilisation) regarding the changes between the 15th and 19th century. Wouters uses Elias’ theory as a framework while critically observing and analyzing it. The dissertation was published in 1990 as Van minnen en sterven and translated into German as Informalisierung. Cas Wouters was strongly influenced by and contributed to the sociological domain of process or figurational sociology. His theory of informalisation implies that a long-term process of formalisation – of formalising manners and disciplining people – had been dominant from the sixteenth up to the last quarter of the nineteenth century, after which a process of informalisation has prevailed: behavioural and emotional alternatives increased, together with demands on emotion management or self-control. Wouters proceeded to elaborate this theoretical perspective in a variety of studies of the late-nineteenth and twentieth-century social and psychic processes, focusing mainly on emotion regulation, dying and mourning, sexuality, and the emancipation of women and children. In 2004 Wouters published Sex and Manners, Female Emancipation in the West 1890-2000. His systematic and empirical approach has been an important contribution to this field of study and is highly appreciated throughout the ranks of his fellow workers and students. Cas Wouters has written articles in English, Dutch, Spanish and German on changes in relationships between men and women, the dying and those who live on, and on related, more general social and psychic processes.

History  Before television, studios played their films in theaters exclusively. However, in 1950 many studios began to sell all their pre-1948 features to television syndicators. The television syndicators then would use these films to fill in their programming schedules. Back in the 1960s, the first domestic ancillary market for feature films was created. NBC was the first to practice the market on September 23, 1961, by programming \\"NBC Saturday Night at the Movies.\\" After such success, ABC became the second network ever to program a series of prime time features in 1962. One of the other networks, CBS, followed and added a prime time feature program in 1965. Today, feature films opens in motion picture theaters to establish its box- office value. After that is established, it is then released to ancillary markets in a particular order as follows: * Video and Pay Per View (PPV) * Premium cable services such as HBO, Showtime, and Cinemax * Cable television * Network television * Television syndication The sequence is to maximize the full economic potential of each market. VCR Home video recorders were made public when Sony introduced the half-inch Betamax cassette in 1975. Following Betamax, the company JVC introduced the Video Home System (VHS). Marketed by RCA and manufactured by Matsushita, VHS soon became known as the video- cassette recorders (VCRs). VCRs, which gave the consumer the option of recording programs from television, were a new form of competition in the demanding consumer market. VCRs revenue contributed to the development of the ancillary market of video and DVD. By the 1980s, five million households owned VCRs. Major studios had not yet adapted to the new video technologies that were being developed for consumers. There were no anticipations of new markets or other opportunities to expand until an entrepreneur, Andre Blay, opened Hollywood film companies’ eyes. Blay wanted the license to transfer and sell their films on tape. After he succeeded and his approach was beneficial, film companies all around became a part of the video distribution. The film companies could not deny the fact that this new distribution would lead to a new revenue stream.P., McDonald & J., Wasko. The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry.2008 DVD As the VHS market saturated, multiple media executives and manufacturers liked the idea of utilizing other home video technologies. In 1993, the film industry upgraded their technology with the creation of several new formats including the DVD, or digital video disc. Many manufacturers such as the Japanese (Hitachi, JVC, Matsushita, Mitsubishi, Pioneer, Sony and Toshiba) and the European (Philips and Thomson) collaborated to facilitate development of the DVD Forum. In March 1997, the US launch of the DVD systems went smoothly due to Hollywood's solidarity. Manufacturers and film studios decided to avoid making the same mistake of the VHS format battles and agreed upon a universal standard of cooperation. When first introduced in 1997, DVDs sold at the low price of $20, for which they offered high-quality image and extra special features. Consumers liked the advantages of the DVDs and soon surpassed VHS sales.Wasser, Frederick.(2008) \\"Ancillary Markets - Video and DVD: Hollywood Retools\\". Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. p. 127-128 Premium television The first premium rate television services were Phonevision, Telemeter, and SubscriberVision, among others. None of them were successful, until the launch of Home Box Office (HBO) in 1972, considered the first successful premium-rate subscription television service. Other services were launched: Z Channel, Showtime, The Movie Channel, Cinemax, Spotlight and Home Theater Network. Only HBO, Showtime, The Movie Channel and Cinemax survived through the 1980s. These premium rate services air features unedited, uncut, and commercial-free, the same way they were shown on theaters and/or home video. Cable televisionNetwork television Out of the many ancillary markets out there, none were more effective and revenue rewarding than network television, and eventually syndication began. Amanda D. Lotz spoke on the radical change in her book titled Television Will Be Revolutionized (2008). She mentions how time went on and as the post-network era developed, that the limited ways there were for medium to be distributed was eliminated. What was expanding, and evolving was network television as a whole.> At first channels were few, and very limited. But soon came the multi- channel transition, then on with the creation of cable TV. As that later expended cable began to see the 'cash cow' in that and began selling shares to different networks in order to air their studio programs. Not only did Network Television open up ancillary markets for TV, but other markets as well. The VCR then became a hot commodity, because the consumer wanted the option of recording. That slowly transitioned to the DVD that took out the VCR, and finally DVR. Which seems to be just that, a VCR and a DVD combined. Network television took a gigantic step when it later allowed programs to have different showing dates, and even multiple air times. This offered different networks to still be able to ear revenue off of an older film that already has left the box office. Making Television Safe for Film According to McDonald and Wasko, Hollywood's interest in emerging medium of television dates from the 1920s and includes experiments with the developing technology, an alternative model of television as home theater, applications for television frequencies, as well as investments in broadcasting companies that were exploring television (Anderson, 1994; Hilmes, 1990; Wasko, 1994). The evidence suggests that studios clearly wanted to control the development and implementation of television technology. Securing that control required the assistance of the Federal Communication Commission, which regulated television's development by articulating technical standards and operating rules and through the FCC's exclusive right to license the use of television frequencies for experimentation or broadcast (McDonald and Wasko, p. 107). Video games Video games are a rapidly growing ancillary market for feature films. Video game over-all gross income has consistently surpassed that of movie sales since 2004. Because of the increased interest in video games many major media and communication companies have begun to show interest in video games as a way to market, brand, and advertise for their product. Some movies that have benefited from this are the Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and James Bond series. Because the video game industry has been able to outplay and outgross many movies, video game manufacturers are beginning to look in the direction of producing their own movies as well. Microsoft's producers of Halo have decided to pass Hollywood studios and produce their own movie.Nichols, Randy.(2008) \\"Ancillary Markets - Video Games: Promises and Challenges of an Emerging Industry\\". Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. p. 132-133 Hollywood has shown interest in the video game industry as an ancillary market almost as far as video games have existed. The film industry's goal within the video game industry is to either seek control and therefore ownership of the video game market or to license products to video game producers. Once the video game profits are high, that is when Hollywood seeks control. On the other hand, when profits are down, that is when Hollywood offers the licensing. The collaboration had always been problematic since the film industry had been uncertain about the development of video games. Hollywood has seen video games as another promotional scheme for a film.Nichols, Randy.(2008) \\"Ancillary Markets - Video Games: Promises and Challenges of an Emerging Industry\\". Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. p. 133 Recorded Music Hollywood has had interactions with the recorded music industry that dates back as far as the studio system itself. The interactions between the two include three main periods; 1927-1957: recorded music as a form of promotion, 1957-1977: recorded music as cross-promotion and ancillary revenue, and 1977-1997: recorded music as cross-promotion, ancillary revenue stream, and means of spreading risk. In addition to music's promotional value, studios realized that, \\"A chart success was an effective way of generating additional revenue for their companies, both in terms of publishing and performance royalties and, of course, in outright sales.\\" Recorded music proved to be of great value as an ancillary market to the film industry. VCR Home video recorders were made public when Sony introduced the half- inch Betamax cassette in 1975. Following Betamax, the company JVC introduced the Video Home System (VHS). Marketed by RCA and manufactured by Matsushita, VHS soon became known as the video-cassette recorders (VCRs). VCRs, which gave the consumer the option of recording programs from television, were a new form of competition in the demanding consumer market. VCRs revenue contributed to the development of the ancillary market of video and DVD. By the 1980s, five million households owned VCRs. Major studios had not yet adapted to the new video technologies that were being developed for consumers. There were no anticipations of new markets or other opportunities to expand until an entrepreneur, Andre Blay, opened Hollywood film companies’ eyes. Blay wanted the license to transfer and sell their films on tape. After he succeeded and his approach was beneficial, film companies all around became a part of the video distribution. The film companies could not deny the fact that this new distribution would lead to a new revenue stream.P., McDonald & J., Wasko. The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry.2008 DVD As the VHS market saturated, multiple media executives and manufacturers liked the idea of utilizing other home video technologies. In 1993, the film industry upgraded their technology with the creation of several new formats including the DVD, or digital video disc. Many manufacturers such as the Japanese (Hitachi, JVC, Matsushita, Mitsubishi, Pioneer, Sony and Toshiba) and the European (Philips and Thomson) collaborated to facilitate development of the DVD Forum. In March 1997, the US launch of the DVD systems went smoothly due to Hollywood's solidarity. Manufacturers and film studios decided to avoid making the same mistake of the VHS format battles and agreed upon a universal standard of cooperation. When first introduced in 1997, DVDs sold at the low price of $20, for which they offered high-quality image and extra special features. Consumers liked the advantages of the DVDs and soon surpassed VHS sales.Wasser, Frederick.(2008) \\"Ancillary Markets - Video and DVD: Hollywood Retools\\".

Biography Born in Pesaro, he was the only son of Pandolfo II Malatesta and his second wife Paola Orsini. He was given the nickname \\"dei sonetti\\" (\\"of the Sonnets\\") due to his love for literature and fine arts. He married Elisabetta da Varano, who gave him seven children : Galeazzo, Carlo, Galeotto, Paola, Pandolfo, Cleofa and Taddea. He became lord of Pesaro in 1385. He was hired by pope Urban VI to fight against antipope Clement VII. In 1390 he fought against the Bolognesi led by Giovanni da Barbiano and later was hired by Republic of Florence against the Visconti of Milan. In 1392 he was excommunicated by the pope for having conquered Todi, namely a Papal possession. He 1394 he served antipope Benedict XIII, who named him captain general of Bologna, to fight against pope Boniface VIII. During the conflict, he destroyed several towns in Umbria and the Latium, and took control Narni and Orte for himself as podestà. Later he made peace with Boniface. In 1404 Malatesta was hired by the Republic of Venice, which assigned him some 20,000 troops to fight against the Carraresi of Padua. However, the Venetian troops was defeated and returned to Pesaro in the late 1404, after which he made a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. Once freed, he sided for antipope Alexander V who, in 1409, ordered him to fight in Tuscany along the Florentines against the forces of Ladislaus of Naples. The conflict lasted until 1412: Malatesta again made peace with the pope, and thenceforth warred against antipope John XXIII. In 1415 he defended his Umbrian fiefs from Braccio da Montone. In 1416-1417 Malatesta was involved in the war for Jesi, which depleted his treasure. In 1423 he was hired by Florence in the war against Milan. In 1424, in the battle of Zagonara, his cousin Carlo was taken prisoner; the same fate struck his sons Galeazzo and Carlo after they were besieged in Gradara by Angelo della Pergola. The following year Malatesta signed a treaty of peace at Abbiategrasso. He retired at Gradara, where he died in 1429. as a patron of the arts, he had housed in Persaro figures such as Francesco Casini and the painter Mariotto di Nardo, and was in correspondence with humanists Coluccio Salutati and his daughter- in-law, Battista Malatesta. Malatesta was also the author of poems, collected in a Canzoniere, influenced by Petrarch and the contemporary Tuscan literature.

It was founded as the Bay Area News Project in January 2010 with money provided by Warren Hellman's Hellman Family Foundation. On May 26, 2010 the organization launched the website, baycitizen.org. In June 2010 The Bay Citizen began producing content for the newly added biweekly two-page Bay Area Report published in The New York Times. The Bay Citizen was part of a small but growing number of similar news organizations across the country dedicated to locally focused public service journalism, including Voice of San Diego, Texas Tribune, and MinnPost.  History  In early 2009 billionaire investor and Bay Area philanthropist Warren Hellman convened an advisory committee to explore a solution to the lack of strong local journalism. In January 2010, The Bay Area News Project was founded. Lisa Frazier, formerly the head of McKinsey & Company’s West Coast Media and Entertainment practice, was appointed President and CEO. Jonathan Weber, formerly of The Industry Standard was recruited to lead the newsroom. In addition to Weber, editorial staff includes Managing Editor for News Steve Fainaru, previously an investigative journalist with the Washington Post; Jeanne Carstensen, formerly of Salon.com, and SFGate.com, and 11 full-time journalists. Weber claims he received over 500 resumes for the editorial positions. On March 23, 2010 the organization changed their name to \\"The Bay Citizen\\" and added the slogan \\"News/Culture/Community.\\" CEO Lisa Frazier said in a news release that the name was chosen because \\"Our mission is to provide news and information that helps create more 'Bay Citizens.'\\" According to the SF Business Times, The Bay Citizen raised $3.7 million from foundations and families. Don Fisher, Gap founder, and Value Act CEO Jeff Ubben donated $1 million each, but the site also raised money from less wealthy and prominent donors. The site received a $250,000 grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, which gives money to journalism projects. This came on top of the Hellman Family Foundation's $5 million in seed money. The Bay Citizen alongside The Texas Tribune also recently received a joint $975,000 grant from the Knight Foundation to develop an open source publishing platform tailored for nonprofit news organizations. The system, named Armstrong, is based on technology The Bay Citizen has previously been employing. Warren Hellman died on December 18, 2011, of complications from treatments for leukemia.

Life and work Vanley Burke was born in St. Thomas, Jamaica, in 1951. For his 10th birthday he was sent a \\"Box Brownie\\" camera – a Kodak Brownie 127 – by his mother, who in the late 1950s had gone to live in England,Graham Young, \\"Celebration of an extraordinary decade in history of city gallery\\", Birmingham Post, 15 July 2014. while he remained with his aunt in St.Thomas. In 1965 at the age of 14 he went to join his parents in the UK, leaving his radio to his aunt as a parting gift but taking his camera with him.\\"Vanley Burke\\", Autograph ABP. Vanley seriously started photography around 1967, making a conscious decision to document the black community and lifestyle in England. His first studio was in Grove Lane, Handsworth, Birmingham. His photographs capture experiences of his community's arrival in Britain, the different landscapes and cultures he encountered, the different ways of survival and experiences of the wider African-Caribbean community. His photography sought to counteract any perception of negative or stereotypical imagery of black people found in mainstream media. His photographsVanley Burke images. represented members of the black community back to themselves in intimate portrayal and were taken from his perspective as an integral member of the community as opposed to basic documentary images perceived from \\"outsiders\\". Burke's interests have expanded to include other communities in the city and their experiences. Burke's first notable exhibition, Handsworth from the Inside, was held at the Ikon Gallery Birmingham, and then the Commonwealth Institute in London in 1983. Since then his work has been exhibited extensively at venues including The Light House, Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery, The Black Arts Gallery in London, Cornerhouse in Manchester and Walsall Museum and Art Gallery, and he has held solo exhibitions abroad in New York City and Mali. In addition to many prestigious galleries and other traditional settings, Burke has purposely exhibited his work in locations more easily accessible to black audiences such as community centres, clubs, pubs, churches, pool halls and schools. The 1993 exhibition From Negative Stereotype to Positive Image included his work alongside that of three other Birmingham photographers: Sir Benjamin Stone (1838-1914), Ernest Dyche (1887-1973) and Claudette Holmes (born 1962). He was a significant contributor of his imagery to the Birmingham photography magazine and collective, Ten.8. Burke's work has also been used in documentaries (including Handsworth Songs, 1986), television programmes, books and on record sleeves such as UB40’s \\"Jeffrey Morgan\\". A biography A Retrospective, on the life and works of Vanley Burke, was published by Lawrence & Wishart, edited by Mark Sealy. In 1990 Burke received a call from a friend in South Africa saying: \\"South Africa is going to be free and we need you here.\\" During two visits to South Africa, in 1990 then in 1996, Burke photographed the life of black South Africans just after Nelson Mandela's release from prison and the subsequent ANC celebrations hosted and attended by Mandela for the anti-Apartheid veterans. The \\"Vanley Burke Archive\\" maintained by Birmingham City Council is a constantly growing photographic and documentary community resource of huge range and depth. Complementing his photographic documentation, Burke collects material which samples and evidences developments and activities of the black community in Britain. The material comprises things such as posters or flyers and funeral cards that may have been seen as disposable at the time of their creation but take greater significance when maintained in the context of his extensive archive. They evidence and provide valuable insight of the daily activities and everyday lives, cultural and religious beliefs, the arts, political ideals, health and many other facets affecting black community and others in Birmingham and in Britain. More than fifty years after first picking up his camera, Burke is still documenting the black community in the UK and has recently worked on a number of projects including an exhibition and publication project documenting the Asian community in Birmingham. From humble beginnings, Burke is often the subject matter of students dissertations and is considered the most renowned and prolific black photographer in the UK, acclaimed as the \\"Grandfather of Black British photography\\". Having won a Kodak Award as early as 1984, he has also received an Honorary Doctorate from Leicester University, UK, in 2007, and the Wolverhampton School of Art and Design presented with an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Art in 2009 at their award ceremony. Professor Stuart Hall endorsed that \\"the personal, social and economic life of black people as they arrived, settled and became established in British society – is being constructed, given a certain meaning, significance, value, by Vanley Burke's camera eye, not merely 'captured'.\\" Vanley Burke is a father to three sons, a grandfather to six children. \\"It's just about the ability to see something others may be unable to see, in terms of the value. Then show people. They need to see their contribution to this community. I mean, they have been contributing to this thing from the 50s and it's gone beyond, but there is no reference anywhere. It's about having themselves reflected, they are so desperate to see themselves. But this will be there, it isn't going anywhere....\\" Vanley Burke, September 2005.

Kelman (born May 17, 1936) is an American film and television documentary producer and director best known for his work on The Body Human and the 1984 television version of A Christmas Carol starring George C. Scott. His career began in the early days of live television (1962) at the local level as a director for the Westinghouse Broadcasting Company, WBZ-TV Boston. Subsequently, he was an Oscar nominee (1966) for his documentary film, The Face of a Genius, an autobiographical study of America's famed playwright, Eugene O'Neill. It marked the first time in the history of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that a film originally produced for television was recognized by the Academy as a nominee for Best Documentary Feature. A mass communications graduate scholar (1959) studying public opinion at Boston University under the aegis of WGBH, a senior research fellow at the MIT Center for International Studies, he also served as a principal of Medcom (1968), a publicly traded company and pioneer of the learning industry in the dissemination of medical knowledge to physicians and the public. As producer, director, and co-creator of the groundbreaking CBS documentary series The Body Human (1977), a cinematic exploration of the relationship between biochemistry, medicine and human behavior, he opened the door to Lifeline, a documentary television series on NBC. Kelman is a three-time winner of the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Documentary Feature and a seven-time Emmy winner for Lifeline and The Body Human. One of the few documentary film makers who moved from nonfiction to a 25-year career as a producer of films and miniseries for television. Biography Kelman's earliest success was in producing and directing The Face of Genius, a documentary about the life of Nobel Prize–winning playwright Eugene O'Neill, nominated for an Academy Award in 1966. marking the first time that a film originally produced for television was recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science as a nominee for Best Documentary Feature. A first- generation American born in the Bronx, New York and raised in Boston, Massachusetts, he is the son of Lawrence and Laura Kelman, Jewish immigrants from Poland. As a teenager in the late 1950s Kelman was a child of the live television era. Hollywood, in the early 1950s as a filmmaking center found its audience for movies tilting drastically in the direction of live television drama. Influenced by the thoughts of comedian Jackie Gleason in a Look magazine article describing the excitement of live television not only as entertainer but the necessity for television directors to emulate the instinctive skills akin to the performance of an athlete. Kelman, though he played high school and college baseball, knowing he did not have the makings of a major leaguer, was drawn to a career in live television. Attending Boston University (1954–1958) he served as production manager of the college radio station WBUR, a breeding ground for future broadcasters and a professional teaching staff in the tradition of famed radio documentary writer and dramatist Norman Corwin. Kelman graduating cum laude was awarded a graduate scholarship to study Communications Research for a master's degree while plying his trade at all levels of production in the early days of live black- and-white television under the guidance of the professionals operating the pioneer educational station WGBH. Kelman's Master's thesis, The Role of Television in the 1958 Massachusetts Gubernatorial Campaign, was described by George D. Blackwood, PhD, (Boston University Professor of Political Science & Chairman, Citizenship Project), as an innovative contribution to the understanding of the power of this new media to influence public opinion. Kelman continued his study of popular culture and mass communications (1960–1962), holding appointments as a senior research fellow at the MIT Center for International Studies leading to assistant professor, Oregon State University serving as research director under Title VII of the National Defense Education Act for The Study of New Media authenticating or repudiating the feasibility of statewide televised instruction. Returning to Boston (1962), Kelman was hired by WBZ-TV Boston as a live television producer- director working what was known at the time (pre video tape), an 8 x 6 live shift, i.e., 8 hour day, 6 days a week @ $95. As a director of early television, he cut his teeth on Boomtown, a children's show starring an authentic cowboy personality Rex Trailer and his sidekick Pancho, played by Richard Kilbride, a multi-talented Boston actor. Boomtown was a two-hour stint every Saturday morning, inclusive of the participation in the studio from dozens of children guests in attendance of each telecast. Immediately following the announcement of the assassination of President Kennedy, Kelman spearheaded the national remote coverage of all events emanating from the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. After the Selma to Montgomery, Alabama riots (1965) Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. (a graduate of Boston University School of Theology) chose Boston for his next rallying cry for racial freedom. In a march stretching over 20 miles through the streets of Greater Boston, crowds estimated in the hundreds of thousand, blacks and whites hand in hand, in racial harmony. Kelman, assigned to produce documentary coverage of this seminal event was granted a private interview with King. The Kelman interview formed the heart of the documentary Martin Luther King in Boston. That year as a WBZ-TV producer/director as well as head of public affairs programming, Kelman formed a career alliance with a young teaching physician from Harvard Medical School, Robert E. Fuisz, M.D. Fuisz worked closely with Kelman to realize his vision to provide medical information to the public with an early morning series, Medical Knowledge For Man, over 60 half-hours. The format featured Fuisz as a physician and was distributed across the spectrum of Group W stations. At that time, Group W, as the U.S. participant for the pioneering documentary series Intertel, selected Kelman to represent the broadcast conglomerate with its partners on an international exchange program between the Canadian Broadcasting Company, Channel 7 Australia and Rediffusion London. There he was assigned to its historic weekly documentary series This Week. While in London, Kelman received word that he had been nominated for the Academy Award for Outstanding Feature Documentary for his production at WBZ-TV Boston (1965), The Face of Genius, the life of Eugene O'Neill narrated by Jason Robards. Variety (1966) dubbed it \\"...a masterful job of welding script, film, stills and music into a first- rate production.\\" Upon his return to the United States, Kelman and News Director Edward Fouhy spearheaded Group W's coverage of the 1964 presidential election between Democratic candidate Texas Senator Lyndon Johnson and Republican Senator Barry Goldwater. In association with future Political Scientist Samuel Popkin, then a PhD candidate at the MIT Center for International Studies and the U.S. computer company Control Data Corporation described in the 1960s as building \\"...the fastest computers in the world by far,\\" WBZ-TV election coverage was recognized by the industry as a pioneer broadcaster in the earliest use of percentile returns to project winning candidates for public office. Group W then assigned Kelman to work in association with The Brookings Institution and The Operation Government Committee of the US Congress producing and directing the definitive behind the scenes statement to date on the nature of government operations, 30 half hours, Congress, the Presidency and the Courts. And then came the fall during the summer of 1967, NYC. Welcome to the fading world of Scopitone films, a forerunner of music videos. The Scopitone machine developed in France, all the rage during the early discothèque club era, was basically a 16mm magnetic striped film jukebox projecting images on a big screen adjacent to a dance floor and bar. Kelman directed over 30 titles, one a day for 30 days, lavishly produced on location from Coney Island to the Catskills, from Manhattan to Brooklyn, from rooftops to swimming pools, subway stations, bridges, construction sites, penthouses, night clubs, dance studios... Audio playback synchronization system, hand held Éclair 16mm, magnetic stripe 16mm stock, e.g. to name a few, The Tokens \\"The Lion Sleeps At Night,\\" Mamie Van Doren \\"Lollypop\\" Lou Monte \\"Martha, Martha,\\" Billy Daniels \\"That Old Black Magic,\\" Tommy Edwards \\"Please Love Me Forever,\\" Bene King \\"There Is A Rose In Spanish Harlem.\\" The project ended in disaster. Films were never released and therein lay another tale. Next stop, the burgeoning knowledge industry in 1968 Kelman was a principal in a publicly held corporation (Medcom, Inc.) founded by Robert E Fuisz, M.D., specializing in medical education and allied health personnel training. Kelman's motivational documentaries designed to close the knowledge gap between the practicing physician and the patient remain in circulation: The Hyperactive Child, The Case For Population Control, Ashes to Ashes, Drug of Choice, 3 Times A Day, Aldosterone: Story Of A Hormone, The Transplanters & Christian Barnard, Schizophrenia. Kelman remained a member of the corporate Board and a key management executive until the sale of Medcom in 1983 to a Fortune 500 company. In 1976 Fuisz & Kelman partnered with Thomas W. Moore, then President of Tomorrow Entertainment and former President for 12 years during the golden age of ABC-TV, (1958-1970), to form The Tomorrow Entertainment/Medcom Co. Thus was executed with the blessing of Richard Salant, President of CBS News, first prime time non-fiction dramatic information series under the aegis of CBS Entertainment, The Body Human. conceived by Thomas W. Moore, Co-Creators Robert E Fuisz, M.D. & Alfred R Kelman, Produced & Directed by Alfred R Kelman, Written by Robert E Fuisz, M.D. Concurrently in 1979, out of experiences from shooting the annual seven- year non-fiction CBS Special The Body Human, grew the beginning of prime time reality television for NBC, Lifeline, 13 hours of real life medical drama.. In 1982 Fuisz & Kelman partnered with NBC Exec William F Storke, forming Entertainment Partners and 7 years on in association with Bernard Sofronski CBS Exec in charge of special drama; amounting to a 20-year stretch for Kelman of movies and mini-series for television (see Filmography). Years later, 1992/93 Kelman, as an independent producer, became a direct participant in a media feeding frenzy over the shooting by teenager Amy Fisher of the wife of her adulterous lover. The judge dubbed her \\"Lethal Lolita\\" setting bail at $2,000,000. Unable to raise bail, a series of legal entanglements ensued over whether her defense attorney, Eric Naiburg, had the right to sell her story in exchange for bail. Advised by counsel that anyone held on bail had a constitutional right to bail. Kelman and his producing partner of KLM Films, Inc, Philip Levitan of Nashville with the expert assistance of agent Ron Yatter (a former executive with The William Morris Agency) became personal guarantors, obtained the rights to Amy Fisher's first hand account of her story resulting in the NBC movie of the week, Amy Fisher: My Story, the only time in the history of television that all 3 networks, ABC, CBS, NBC aired a motion picture docudrama on the same subject within weeks of one another. The full story of Amy Fisher is excellently depicted as a sociological work by Sheila Weller, author \\"Amy Fisher: My Story.\\" Retrospectively, a career covering over 50 years, the gross budget for Kelman's productions, i.e., money spent above and below the line put on the screen, is estimated in the high range of 8 figures. During the last few years (2003–09) Kelman was preoccupied serving in the public sector. A resident of Sagaponack, New York, a 350-year- old hamlet within the municipal jurisdiction of Southampton, New York, at the eastern end of Long Island, that found itself under intense pressure from neighboring homeowners to split off a 3-mile stretch of ocean front to form a privately incorporated village. Kelman, a principal organizer of the successful opposition was ultimately elected a Trustee under the laws of the State of New York (2005) and dubbed a founding father of the Incorporated Village of Sagaponack, the historic boundaries of the hamlet remaining intact. Currently he is at work on a screenplay trilogy based upon autobiographical experiences, \\"Hayfever, \\" \\"At Water's Edge, \\" and \\"Swan's Way.\\" Most recently, March 2013, Kelman's early production \\"The Face of Genius\\" Academy Award Nominee Best Documentary Feature 1965 was honored with a special 35mm screening by the UCLA Festival of Preservation before a live audience at The Billy Wilder Theater Los Angeles including a Q & A session conducted by noted film historian and critic Paul Malcolm. It is now in release as a digitized special edition for students of University Schools of Drama worldwide as well as available for screening at the national Eugene O'Neill Theater Center. February 2016, Kelman's pencil drawings were on display, a monthlong exhibit at a Washington CT gallery, \\"A Year of Displaced Energy,\\" culled from 1992/93 while studying at the Art Student League of New York City, under the tutelage of Michael Burban, a Master Teacher of figure drawings and author, \\"Lessons From The Masters,\\" a classic study of the anatomical beauty of the work of Michelangelo. From November 2016-March 2017, 18 life drawings influenced by and after the Masters of the Renaissance were on exhibit at Lotos, a private New York City club founded in 1870 dedicated to the arts & literature, Mark Twain being among its earliest members.

The gauge of was used for the national Italian rail network and was very similar to the standard gauge commonly used elsewhere in the world. Since the 1930s, the gauge has been adopted as the standard and gradually replaced the track gauge. Thus, in Italy, only a few older tram systems, such as the Milanese tramway network, remain equipped with . The other popular gauge, a narrow gauge, was defined at and is very similar to the metre gauge – – commonly used in many other parts of Europe and thus came to be known as \\"the Italian metre gauge\\". Historical legal definitions of 1879 Milan tramway network, the largest in Italy, runs on Italian broad gauge. Italian law defined its track gauges in terms of the distance between the centres of each rail, rather than the inside edges of the rails, giving some unusual measurements. According to the law of 28 July 1879, the only legal gauges in Italy were , , measured between the rail centres, which correspond to and between the rail inside edges. The narrower gauge has 1,000 mm between the centres of the rails, which explains why it is called Italian metre gauge, in spite of it in fact being 950 mm in gauge when measured from the inside of the rails, in the way gauges are normally measured in other countries. A disadvantage of measuring from the centre of the rail is that the width of the rail varies, affecting the gauge. It is easier and more reliable to measure from the inner edges of the rails.  gauge railways The following systems survive today: *Orvieto Funicular *Milan tram network *Turin tram network *Rome tram network *Naples tram network  or standard gauge railways The Italian standard gauge railway system has a total lengthTotal length of tracks: double tracks are counted twice. of of which active lines are 16,723 km.

Retrieved on 2013-12-09. The first models were informally announced on 26 April 2011, using the code names, by the Sony Corporation in the Sony IT Mobile Meeting. They featured touchscreens, two cameras (a rear-facing 5 MP, a front-facing 0.3 MP), infrared sensor, Wi-Fi. Also, they support PlayStation Suite, DLNA, and are 3G/4G compatible. The retail price in the U.S at the time of release was US$499–599. In Europe, prices were at €499. To increase the number of apps available and provide marketing support for both tablets, Sony and Adobe Systems will hold a $200,000 competition targeting app developers. The series was formally launched in Berlin and Tokyo on 31 August 2011. The latest in the series is the Xperia Z4 Tablet.  History  On April 26, 2011, Sony announced that it would be developing two Android tablets, codenamed S1 and S2. The S1 (which became the Tablet S) was said to be \\"optimized for rich media entertainment\\" while the S2 (later Tablet P) would be \\"ideal for mobile communication and entertainment\\".  Promotional videos  On 15 June 2011, Sony released the first in a series of five videos titled \\"Two Will\\", promoting and featuring the Tablets in an elaborately designed Rube Goldberg Machine. The episodes are entitled: * Prologue * The First Impression * Going smoothly * Filled with fun * Together anywhere  Tablet S  The Sony Tablet S (former code name Sony S1) has one touchscreen display in a slate layout, and a unique wrap design inspired by the way some persons fold magazines while reading them. In landscape orientation, the unit along the top is about three times thicker than along the bottom, forming a mild slant. It was released on 11 September 2011, as the first available member of the Sony Tablet series. The suggested retail prices are $499 for the 16 GB model and $599 for the 32 GB model. In early reviews in late 2011, the units compared favorably to similar high-end tablets.  Tablet P  The Sony Tablet P (former code name Sony S2) has two touchscreen interoperating displays joined in a hinged clamshell layout, resembling the VAIO P series. It was released in November 2011, as the second available member of the Sony Tablet series. The suggested retail price is $599. While the unique clamshell design allowed the device to fold in half and fit into a pocket, this feature resulted in the screen being split in half by a large, black hinge, which made playing games and reading awkward and is cited as the Tablet P's most serious flaw. The Tablet P was pulled from Sony's American website by the end of 2012 and will not receive the update to Android Jellybean.

Inaugurated in March 2002, Layalina aims to dispel negative stereotypes of the other and help increase mutual understanding between the U.S. and Arab-speaking countries.Ali Jafaar, \\"'Road' to understanding\\" Variety, March 23, 2007 The organization's following has been notably bipartisan, with leading foreign policy veterans and media experts from both Republican and Democratic backgrounds making up the organization's Board of Directors and Board of Counselors including Henry A. Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Sam Nunn, and former President George H. W. Bush. History and organization Former ambassador Richard M. Fairbanks founded the non-profit in 2002 as a means of improving the United States' public diplomacy presence in the Middle East. At its inception, Layalina was envisioned as a broadcaster in its own right, transmitting programs to homes throughout the region. Upon consulting with colleagues, however, Fairbanks decided to take a more subtle tack first suggested by former Ambassador to Morocco Marc Ginsberg. Under this strategy, Layalina would seek to produce programs funded by private donors, then sell the rights to broadcasters already operating in the region. In this way, Layalina could avoid the mistrust associated with an overtly pro-American, U.S. Government-run broadcaster like Voice of America or Alhurra, yet still producing programming which could remain both popular and impactful. Convinced, Fairbanks adopted this course of action and shortly thereafter asked Ginsberg to join the organization as its President. The standing lineup of Layalina's organizational leadership is as follows: Chairman of the Board of Directors: Shannon Fairbanks Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors: Richard H. Solomon Honorary Chairman of the Board of Counselors: George H. W. Bush President: Leon Shahabian Productions Layalina has developed and produced a wide range of programs for the Middle Eastern market, from reality television to news analysis to documentaries. * Yemeniettes * Generation Entrepreneur * On the Road in America, Seasons 1 - 3 * Life After Death * American Caravan * Back from the Brink * Al-Sa'at (The Hour) * Ben & Izzy * Sister Cities * Araeh (Opinions) Yemeniettes Yemeniettes follows a team of teenage girls from the Al-Sayida Zainab School in Sana'a as they strive to break barriers of traditional Yemeni society through entrepreneurship. From the creation of an innovative solar energy project to its submission in the national INJAZ Yemen competition and their eventual participation in the INJAZ Al-Arab Regional Competition in Qatar, the film explores the trials and tribulations they face along the way. Set against the backdrop of a country marked with weak economic policies, a struggling political infrastructure and a dangerous Al-Qaeda presence, Yemeniettes surveys issues of youth unemployment, underemployment, education, drug abuse and demographic pressures. It brings to the screen this part of the world that is often overlooked while maintaining a message of hope and triumph. Yemeniettes was produced as a feature-length documentary for screening in the US and as two-episodes for broadcast in Yemen. It won Best Documentary, Best Vision of the Future and Best Innovation & Entrepreneurship awards at the Silicon Valley Film Festival in December 2013. It was also official selection to the Thin Line Film Festival, Cleveland International Film Festival, Millennium Film Festival and the Al Jazeera International Documentary Film Festival. Generation Entrepreneur Layalina's newest reality television series, Generation Entrepreneur, features the efforts of young Arab entrepreneurs competing for incubation funding to start companies as part of the 2012 INJAZ al-Arab regional entrepreneurship program. At a time when a surging youth population has led to record youth unemployment and underemployment throughout the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, the series celebrates innovation among Arab youth and spreads a message of hope for the future. Showcasing national competitions in Egypt, Lebanon and Tunisia, Generation Entrepreneur follows teams of young Arab students who believe in the promise of economic opportunity as they launch start-ups, elect officers, issue stock, market their products, and compete nationally for a chance to attend the regional competition in Qatar. In the nail-biting season finale, the winners of these national contests compete head-to-head at the INJAZ al-Arab regional final for the title of \\"Best Company of the Year.\\" The series aired in primetime in October 2013 on OSN (Orbit Showtime Network), the leading paid satellite television network in the MENA region.

The Fort of Beauregard is a fortification located in the French city of Besançon.  History  After two wars (in 1674 when Louis XIV of France took the city from the Spanish, and in 1814 when Austria declared war on Napoleon I), the French military decided to build a fort on Bregille hill, to defend the old city of Besançon. This hill is higher than the principal fortification of the city, the citadel of Besançon. Because the hill's strategic position had been used against the city in the past, the necessity for a real military defense there had become evident, and so the fort was built. The first fort on the site was built in 1791; it was captured in 1814 during the Six Days' Campaign. To improve the defences, Jacob François Marulaz built the first polygonal fort in France on the site in 1870. Later, the fort was abandoned and transformed into a public garden.

He is the winner of the Southeast Asian Writers Award in 1981 for the short story \\"Khun- Thong you will return at dawn\\" Life and career He was born in the Hua Hin district of Prachuap Khiri Khan to a family that fished the waters of the Gulf of Thailand for a living.Thammachot, Atsiri. \\"dèk phûu-jǐŋ khon kɛ̀ɛ mɛɛw lɛ́? phǒm\\". Bangkok: Sù-phaa Publishing, 1989 He attended school in Hua Hin until his father lost his fishing boat at sea, at which point the family mortgaged the house and land so that the father could purchase another one, which he then lost at sea soon after.Thammachoat, Atsiri (Translated by Marcel Barang). \\"Of time and tide\\". Bangkok: Thai Modern Classics, 1995 ;National Statistics Office census work After finishing up his secondary education in Bangkok, a biography of him in khɔ̀ɔp fáa thá-lee kwâaŋ notes that he worked for the National Statistics Office census in the provinces of Sakon Nakhon, Nakhon Phanom, and Phetchabun for two years. It is noted to be a time that allowed him to become informed of the problems facing communities in rural areas.National Statistics Office−NSO Part of the reason for his going to work for the NSO were the difficult financial circumstances his family was confronting with respect to the fishery bringing in insufficient income. In the prelude to his work, dèk phûu-jǐŋ khon kɛ̀ɛ mɛɛw lɛ́? phǒm, it is noted that while surveying for the NSO Thammachot went to villages with three hundred households or more, where beyond fulfilling his role of collecting data for the census he was able to communicate with household members on a variety of subjects, gaining first-hand accounts to learn of the particular challenges and obstacles facing these groups of people, and building up a more well defined sense of life in Isan and the north. Marcel Barang writes that the period Thammachot spent working for the NSO in the Northeast and North exposed him to the “hotbeds of communist insurgency” that were prevalent in the late 1960s, and that during this time he started to drink, began to have an interest in politics, and kept records of his experiences that later functioned as a foundation for his future literary projects. Barang further notes that the 1972 work, An old man’s memories (sǎm-nʉ́k khɔ̌ɔŋ phɔ̂ɔ thâw), was the first of his short stories, and was based in large part on the experiences he had acquired while living in the Northeast. ;University When Thammachot completed his secondary school education in Bangsue north of Bangkok, he attempted to study in the department of Political Science at Chulalongkorn but failed to gain admission. However, after working for the NSO, he was accepted into the department of Public Relations and Mass Communications at Chulalongkorn. He began writing when he was an undergraduate student; for the short story An old man’s memories, noted above, he received third place in the competition for the prize phláp phlaam maa-lii in 2515 (1972) from the ‘Chulalongkorn Literary Assembly’. He entered study in the department of Communication Arts at Chulalongkorn University in 1970. ;Journalist and writer After university, he went to work for two to three newspapers and attempted, without much success, to publish books about cinema. In 2517 (1974) he worked as a newsman for Siamrath and became a regular editor for the newspaper’s entertainment page; however, during the 1980s he was a regular columnist for Siamrath, and additionally assisted editors in choosing articles and letters to publish in the newspaper. Atsiri Thammachot still writes articles for Siamrath, and his pieces appear periodically in the form of editorials. In a discussion provided by a literary analysis group following the stories in the collection bâan rim thá-lee it is noted that Thammachot’s employment at the newspaper constrains the opportunities he has to write short stories, but at the same time, his role working in news media adds to his creative capacity through the perspective of one who is an observer (paraphrasing from Thai).bòt wí-khrɔ́ rʉ̂aŋ sân naj rɔ̂ɔp sìp pii khɔ̌ɔŋ Atsiri Thammachot dooj klùm waan-ná-kaam phí-nít naj naŋ-sʉ̌ʉ “bâan rim thá- lee” by Atsiri Thammachot. Bangkok: Wá-lii Publishing, 1984 As for the themes that motivate his creative works, Thammachot remarks that he aims to have people in Thai society understand the lives of one another, especially the ‘small lives’ that exist at the fringes of society in Thailand. He says further that if he is able to accomplish this, regardless of how much or little this goal is met, people will be able to establish love and understanding and will be able to help and assist one another.Thammachot, Atsiri. \\"khɔ̀ɔp fáa thá-lee kwâaŋ\\" Bangkok: Tôn-màak Publishing Company, 1981 Works ;Short stories In the collection of short stories bâan rim thá-lee a discussion following the texts by the Literary Analysis Group (klùm waan-ná- kaam phí-nít) provides outlines of the rhetorical character and central themes that emerge in Thammachoat’s work. Noting that his stories use language to generate a soft rhythm, the discussion points out that in almost all of Thammachot’s stories, the concept of pleasure and enjoyment (khwaam-rʉ̂ʉn-rom) as a guiding theme in the plot is absent. Recognizing that there are definite trends of sorrow, the Group also notes, however, that the central themes of his work do not concentrate on or suggest a loss of hope. Rather, concepts such as coming to an understanding of the realities of certain conditions, gaining new knowledge, and uncovering the beauty that hides in life’s small things (paraphrasing from Thai) appear in his work. The use of such ideas implies a sense of introducing a moral direction, which is aimed to educate the reader in some way. ;Novels In comparison with his short stories, his novels are said to bear a lot of similarities in terms of main ideas; however, the novels contain significantly more description and attention to individual details. For example, plots concentrating on people who earn a livelihood from the sea tend to show up amid changing economic and environmental circumstances owing to forces beyond their control in both types of work.

It reopened in 1995 under non-licensed dinosaur theming, and closed in 2010. From 2011 onwards, some temporary Dinotown exhibits operated in other locations.  History  The Ell family opened Bedrock City in 1975. Buildings were based on the Bedrock city, featured in the Hanna-Barbera animated television series The Flintstones. Three other themed attractions held a Flintstones license, aside from the Kings Entertainment Company parks. The park acquired large pipe, angle-iron and cement dinosaurs from Dyck's Dinosaur Park in Maple Ridge. The park included a \\"Jurassic Exhibit\\" on loan from the Royal Tyrrell Museum, a paleontology museum in Drumheller, Alberta. As of 2000, the park had a White Spot hamburger and casual dining restaurant, dubbed White Spot Dinersaurus. The attraction would have a promotional Kids Playce at the Pacific National Exhibition some years, to preview their attraction.

It is part of the chain company Heritage Hotels, which have hotels based in many locations around New Zealand. History The Freemasons' Arms on the corner of Trafalgar and Bridge Streets received one of the first eight liquor licenses issued in the Nelson area in 1842. The hotel had various names during its history and was last called the Central Hotel. Its last owner, DB Breweries, closed it in December 1972 and transferred the liquor license to its new hotel, the DB Rutherford Hotel, which was officially opened on 18 December 1972 by Prime Minister Norman Kirk. It was named after Ernest Rutherford, who was born in nearby Brightwater (then called Spring Grove). The land that the hotel is built on previously housed Nelson Breweries, which stemmed from the merger of two of Nelson's larger breweries. Previous Mayors of Nelson involved in the companies include Joseph Dodson and Joseph Auty Harley; the latter lived in Fifeshire House next door to Rutherford Hotel. Nelson Breweries were purchased by DB Breweries in 1969, and that provided the land on which the hotel was to be built. The hotel's name, DB Rutherford, caused confusion as to who the man with those initials were. Some of Rutherford's relatives demanded that his name be dropped based on him having been a teetotaller (which is apparently incorrect). When the Quality Inn group bought the hotel, the Rutherford name was dropped against the wishes of many staff and locals. As part of a major refurbishment, the Rutherford name was reinstated due to public pressure. In mid-2012, development of a larger conference centre started, able to hold 500 (banquet-style) to 700 (theatre- style) attendees. The National Party will hold its 2013 annual conference in the new facility in August. Location The hotel is located at a slight left from the intersection of Trafalgar Square and Nile Street West, and the main entrance is on Trafalgar Square. The hotel stands on the west edge of Trafalgar Square, the gardens surrounding Nelson Cathedral. The Cathedral's bell tower stands close to the hotel, and can be seen from rooms in the southern wing. Exterior The hotel dominates the skyline and can be seen from other suburbs. It is also easily identifiable by the large sign with a golden, curly R on top of the building. It is a Bisque colour in appearance. Adjacent to the lobby entrance is the Hogland Glass company retail outlet. There is a swimming pool located outside the hotel. The hotel surpassed the then-tallest building, the Post Office Building. The hotel is located in the Nelson CBD. Interior and lobby The hotel lobby has the main desk slightly left of the entrance, and a grand staircase, leading to the mezzanine, and then to the other floors. The lobby has elevators operating from the bottom floor to the top floor. There is a large wishing fountain located in the lobby, and often there will be a classic car parked in the lobby for viewing, from the World of Wearable Art & Classic Cars museum. The hotel has 9 floors and 113 rooms, a private outdoor pool as well as a gymnasium. There are several dining options in the hotel: the seafood restaurant, Oceano, the Japanese restaurant, Miyazu, located on the mezzanine floor, the Atom Cafe, and the nautical themed Port 'o' Call bar.

It is a follow-up to Taito's 1987 arcade game of the same title, and shares similar gameplay. The player can choose between playing as one of three ninja androids, each with different attributes and a unique set of moves including jumps, dashes, throws, and other attacks. The game was developed by the same team at Natsume that later developed Wild Guns (1994). The game was generally well received by critics. They compared the quality of The Ninja Warriors to Neo Geo and arcade games, and the tight controls and vibrant graphics were universally praised. Reviewers disagreed on the quality of several aspects including the difficulty, sound quality, and how well the game distinguished itself among the myriad of beat 'em up games. An enhanced remaster titled The Ninja Saviors: Return of the Warriors was released in 2019. Gameplay Kunoichi kicking an enemy after jumping in the air (Japanese version) The Ninja Warriors is a beat 'em up game that plays in a side-scrolling manner similar to the 1987 arcade version. The player can choose to play as one of three androids with ninja skills: the slow but powerful \\"Ninja\\" armed with a nunchaku, the quick but weak \\"Kamaitachi\\" with sickles on his arms, or the balanced \\"Kunoichi\\" who wields knives and swords. Per the story, the androids were built by a rebel faction to help them overthrow the tyrant Banglar ruling over their nation. After a sudden attack by Banglar's forces, the rebels had to release the androids to fight, untested. The player can move along a single plane, with the stages typically going in a linear direction and ending with a boss. Each character has a different set of moves which include speed dashes, jumps, grabs, blocks, and a variety of attack moves. There is a power meter that increases slowly with time that, when full, lets the player trigger a powerful attack that damages all enemies on the screen. The meter drains completely if the player is knocked to the ground. Some items, such as motorcycles and large safes, can be picked up and tossed at enemies. The environments occasionally introduce hazards that can hurt the player as well as enemies, such as mine fields or armed helicopters. The Ninja Warriors has eight stages and unlimited continues. The player character can be changed when using a continue. Plot In a dystopian future, the world is dominated by a dictatorial regime ruled by a dwarfish mutant-cyborg man who calls himself \\"Banglar the Tyrant\\", and he commands an army of brainwashed human soldiers, vicious mutants and non-sentient combat robots. For years he ruled the global superpower unchallenged, until a rebel army rises up against him, led by a dictator human named Mulk. Unable to defeat Banglar and his mutant armies using conventional weapons and fearing the World Government's forces were closing in on them, Mulk's rebel army decides to take one last shot by sending a trio of self-aware combat androids styled after Japanese Ninjas after Banglar in a suicide mission, knowing they would self-destruct but girded with bombs to take him out as they go. In the end they manage to reach Banglar's fortress, fighting through his mutant legion and detonating their bombs, self- destructing themselves and Banglar the Tyrant in the process. Several months later Mulk becomes the new President of the World Government. The core-data of the androids were retrieved and they were reconstructed, the progression of the AI technology which allowed the Ninja Warriors to think and fight on their own continued under Mulk's regime, becoming far stronger than Banglar's old forces, and Mulk ends up just as much of a tyrant as the fallen Banglar.  Development and release  The Ninja Warriors was developed by Natsume, specifically the same team that later developed Wild Guns (1994). (Translation ) The team consisted of three core members: game designer and artist Shunichi Taniguchi, programmer Toshiyasu Miyabe, and composer Hiroyuki Iwatsuki. Gaming journalists have deemed it both a remake and sequel of the 1987 arcade original from Taito. The original game was one of Taito's most popular arcade games and set a standard for beat 'em ups. The game was first released on January 28, 1994 in Japan, published by Taito as The Ninja Warriors Again. Taito localized the game for a release in North America around February that same year, and Titus published the game in Europe in April 1995. The western localizations featured minor censorship, replacing some female ninja enemies with small male creatures. All regional versions of The Ninja Warriors have since become valuable collector's items.  Reception  The Ninja Warriors received generally positive reviews. Critics matched its quality to that of Neo Geo and arcade games, and some wrote that the game was better than the original arcade version. GameFan called it Taito's best game to date, and the best game of its kind on the SNES. Electronic Gaming Monthly called it \\"the best side-scrolling fighting game yet.\\" Two aspects of the gameplay that were highlighted by multiple critics were the tight and responsive controls, and the variety of each character's moves. GamePro wrote that it borrowed defensive techniques and interesting offensive combos from fighting games, all of which help set The Ninja Warriors apart from other beat 'em ups. Some believed that the game lacked innovation, and instead fell into a pattern of repetitive gameplay. In this regard, Mega Fan wrote that the game did not do enough to distinguish itself from Final Fight (1989). Player One and GameFan disagreed, writing that game stands out and keeps the player's interest more than most Final Fight clones. The game's level of challenge was both praised as fair, and criticized as too easy. GamePro wished the game was more difficult, believing it would be easy for veterans of fighting games, and only an intermediate challenge for others. Some other recurring complaints were the lack of a two-player cooperative mode and the game's short length. Nearly all aspects of the game's graphics were praised, including the colors, shading, backgrounds, animation, and large sprites. Player One wrote that the graphics were arcade quality, and the animations were as good as Street Fighter. GameFan wrote that The Ninja Warriors looked like a Neo Geo game, and felt that only the arcade game The Punisher (1993) rivaled its smooth animation. Some believed the sound and music were also of high quality, but they were criticized by others. Super Play wrote that \\"the only thing worth criticizing about this game is the sound\\", and complained about the weak grunt noises coming from enemies when they are hit. Retrospective reviews have continued to be positive. Retro Gamer wrote that its variety and presentation make The Ninja Warriors one of the best beat 'em ups. AllGame felt that the game's components were not noteworthy individually, but that it was greater than the sum of its parts, calling it \\"an old-school, side-scrolling fighter done right.\\" GameFan felt that the game was \\"unapologetic in its assimilation of the genre standards. If it wasn’t so pretty, it’s likely we would hold that against it.\\" Both Hardcore Gaming 101 and GameFan cited the game's lack of cooperative gameplay as one of its biggest weaknesses. The female ninja Kunoichi has gained some recognition. Electronic Gaming Monthly listed her among their list of \\"Top Ten Fighting Women\\", and GamesRadar+ listed her among the best ninja assassins in video games. Remaster The original core staff that developed The Ninja Warriors, known today as Natsume Atari's team Tengo Project, developed an enhanced remaster for the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. The game was released by Taito in July 2019 in Japan. It is titled The Ninja Warriors Once Again in Japan and The Ninja Saviors: Return of the Warriors internationally. It was released by Arc System Works in Asia and by Strictly Limited Games in Europe. An early playable demo was showcased alongside the SNES original at Tokyo Game Show 2018. The remaster enhances the game's graphics and adds new gameplay elements, similar to the team's previous remaster of Wild Guns.

She appears in both Portal and Portal 2 as the main player character. Not much is known about Chell but it is believed she is the daughter of an employee at Aperture. Development and design Valve's Erik Wolpaw felt that it did not really matter what kind of person Chell was, noting that playtesters of the first Portal often did not know her name as it was never mentioned. Wolpaw explained that they never mentioned her name as felt like they had this relationship with GLaDOS, and they wanted GLaDOS to recognize them\\". Chet Faliszek noted that Chell was the female version of Gordon Freeman's role as a silent protagonist (in the Half-Life video games). Wolpaw explained it served the game's humour better if she did not talk, and that if she, the \\"straight man in a world gone mad,\\" did talk, \\"it would suck\\". In fact, there is one part of the first game where GLaDOS seems to get annoyed by Chell's refusal to respond to her, saying, \\"Are you even listening to me?\\" (Wolpaw has commented a few times that Chell simply won't give GLaDOS the satisfaction of a response, but he doesn't intend that theory to be taken seriously). In an interview by IGN about Portal 2: Lab Rat, Valve's Michael Avon Oeming commented that, currently, \\"Chell is more of a storytelling device,\\" comparing her to the Spirit character by Will Eisner, but noted that more may be seen of Chell in the future. The concept art for Chell. When making Portal 2, developers considered not bringing back the character. However, this was changed as playtesters wanted GLaDOS to recognize them as the person who had killed her in the first game. In her original redesign for Portal 2 developers tried to make her look appealing, yet not overdesigned, with nothing made simply for fashion. They explored changing her nationality, and tried to make her look less human due to the \\"constant dehumanization of these test subjects\\". Being a test subject, Chell's suit was designed to look neither sexy nor unattractive. The original redesign of the character featured a laboratory hat, which was thought of halfway through the concepting phase. Matt Charlesworth, Valve's concept artist, commented that the hat reminded him of test pilots. This look was eventually abandoned in favor of returning to her original orange jumpsuit, this time with the jumpsuit wrapped around her waist. Valve's art team explained that this was to give her more freedom and help her stand out more as an individual. Appearances Chell in the first Portal game In Portal, Chell is performing tests for Aperture Science, which are being overseen by GLaDOS, an artificially intelligent computer system. Chell destroys GLaDOS in her efforts to escape but is wounded, and an unseen figure called the Party Escort Bot drags her back inside. In Portal 2: Lab Rat, a tie-in comic for Portal 2, Chell is put in stasis by Doug Rattmann after the events of Portal. He is revealed to be responsible for Chell taking part in the tests. Chell reappears in Portal 2 where she is reawakened by Wheatley. She and Wheatley attempt to escape the laboratory, and in the process accidentally reanimate GLaDOS. GLaDOS, furious with Chell for having \\"murdered\\" her, forces her to do more tests until Wheatley helps her escape. Chell and Wheatley team up to destroy GLaDOS's neurotoxin and turret production. GLaDOS eventually recaptures Chell, but fails to kill her due to her lack of neurotoxin and turrets. Chell takes advantage of the moment to replace GLaDOS's core with Wheatley's core. Wheatley, corrupted and driven to megalomania by inhabiting GLaDOS's former shell, betrays Chell and instead of freeing her, sends her to the very bottom of the Testing Facility. There she navigates several Mobility Gel testing areas that were in use between 1956 and 1985. As she ascends through level after level, she learns about the late founder of Aperture Science, Cave Johnson, and his assistant, Caroline, whose personality and intelligence were ultimately implanted in GLaDOS. Chell finds and picks up GLaDOS, whom Wheatley has placed in a small module powered by a potato battery. Opening the hatch that seals off the old facility from the new, Chell inadvertently pumps Mobility Gels up to the new facility, which later proves useful. Wheatley captures her and forces her to run tests for him until she finds his lair. And after attaching corrupted cores onto Wheatley, with the process of reverting being booby-trapped, she fires a portal to the moon which sucks her and Wheatley out into space. Chell is saved by GLaDOS, who lets her leave the facility via an elevator that takes her to the surface. Chell's origin is unclear; GLaDOS claims that in Chell's file it states that she is adopted. In Portal 2, a long-abandoned science fair poster that was part of \\"Bring Your Daughter to Work Day\\" -- the same day GLaDOS went rogue -- is attributed to \\"Chell\\", implying that at least one of her parents worked for Aperture Science. At least one journalist has taken this to suggest that Chell is Cave Johnson's daughter. As both Portal games are presented in a first- person view, Chell is only seen fleetingly in normal gameplay, usually when portals are aligned in such a way that the player is able to create a recursive view of Chell. Placing two portals next to each other on a wall and then partially entering the one portal while facing the other allows the player a close-up view of Chell's face. Chell is a playable character in the crossover game Lego Dimensions, and has access to her portal gun. Her character pack includes a sentry turret and a companion cube, and unlocks a bonus level in which she returns to Aperture and is reunited with Wheatley, with the two trying to stop GLaDOS once more. Chell's face and body model were derived from those of the director, producer and voice actress Alésia Glidewell. Reception and analysis A cosplayer portraying Chell while holding a Weighted Companion Cube. GamesRadar's Joe McNeilly called Chell an example of Portal deconstructing first-person shooter archetypes, noting that she was neither in third-person nor sexualized unlike most female characters in first-person shooters. GamesRadar called Chell the antidote to the half- naked woman cliché, praising her for not being sexualized and being fully clothed, commenting, \\"The hero of Portal just happens to be a normal-looking and normal-dressing woman, like 50% of the world's population.\\" GamesRadar listed Chell (jokingly) as one of its Mediocre Game Babes, calling her jumpsuit repulsive and saying, \\"[Her] heel springs make her look like one of those aliens from The Arrival.\\" IGN listed Chell as the sixth top gaming heroine, calling her \\"one of the most resourceful heroines on [their] list\\". In an in-depth analysis of Portal, Daniel Johnson from Gamasutra said that Chell being female, as well as GLaDOS's line about testing your daughter in Aperture Science Bring Your Daughter to Work Day, alluded to the testing of women. Johnson also noted that the information about who Chell is and why she is there reinforced the position of the player as an unwilling participant. GamesRadar said that it considered putting Chell on its list of the Top 7 Tasteful game heroines, but said she lost out to Zoey from Left 4 Dead. Kotaku's Luke Plunkett called Chell's original design in the first game memorable, later noting how in the first Portal \\"Chell [...] was never really the star of the game\\" as well as how little she was actually seen. Mike Fahey, also from Kotaku, defended Chell from people saying that she should talk, and said, \\"The last thing I would want in Portal 2 is for Chell to speak\\". When reviewing Portal 2, Game Informer's Adam Biessener said that much of what makes Portal and Portal 2 so special was the execution and the originality of standing in Chell's shoes and experiencing her destiny.

The lagoon is home to the Buena Vista Audubon Society Nature Center, and is California's first Ecological Reserve. Two non-profit organizations are committed to the preservation and management of the lagoon: the Buena Vista Audubon Society and the Buena Vista Lagoon Foundation Flora and fauna The lagoon harbors at least 103 bird species, 18 mammals, and 14 amphibians and reptiles. Buena Vista also serves as a valuable wetland habitat for migrating bird species during the fall months. In the 1970s, the lagoon was home to a group of pink flamingos that locals believed escaped from the San Diego Zoo, but the Zoo steadfastly denied that they were missing any flamingos. A weir exists about 100 yards from the ocean. Depending on the season and rainfall, there may be outflow into the Pacific Ocean. There has been discussion on whether to maintain the Buena Vista Lagoon as freshwater or to open it to the ocean, allowing saltwater mixing much as with the nearby Agua Hedionda Lagoon. As of early 2018, no definitive plans have been set to change the lagoon, however.http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/communities/north-county/sd-no- lagoon-meeting-20180125-story.html References Motorists feed birds at Buena Vista Lagoon, 1975.

The shop moved to 4 St. Mark's Place on the same block in 1967, and closed in 1975 (giving way to another counterculture clothing store, Trash and Vaudeville, which catered to punk fashions for 41 years at the address). In the May 1968 issue of eye Magazine, Norman Steinberg described Limbo as: \\"...the East Village clothier of the 'tuned-in' generation.\\" He went on to write: \\"For the uninitiated, Limbo is much more than just a clothing store. It is a social, intellectual, and entertainment experience that appeals to people of all ages, races, creeds, colors and political persuasions.\\" In his 2016 memoir, American Dreamer: My Life in Fashion & Business, Tommy Hilfiger recalled: \\"Limbo was the best clothing store in the world.

Limbo's eclectic merchandise – from vintage suits, dresses and military uniforms, to original designed outfits made of Indian cottons and silks – helped introduce the free-wheeling sartorial expression associated with the 1960s—a style that informed and was informed by rock & roll music and radical politics, Eastern spirituality and liberated sexuality.\\"Living and Shopping: In East Village Boutiques\\".

Sculpture in stone is much rarer although there are some excellent carvings in basalt by Mike Tavioni. The proximity of islands in the southern group helped produce a homogeneous style of carving but which had special developments in each island. Rarotonga is known for its fisherman's gods and staff-gods, Atiu for its wooden seats, Mitiaro, Mauke and Atiu for mace and slab gods and Mangaia for its ceremonial adzes. Most of the original wood carvings were either spirited away by early European collectors or were burned in large numbers by missionary zealots. Today, carving is no longer the major art form with the same spiritual and cultural emphasis given to it by the Maori in New Zealand. However, there are continual efforts to interest young people in their heritage and some good work is being turned out under the guidance of older carvers. Atiu, in particular, has a strong tradition of crafts both in carving and local fibre arts such as tapa. Mangaia is the source of many fine adzes carved in a distinctive, idiosyncratic style with the so-called double-k design. Mangaia also produces food pounders carved from the heavy calcite found in its extensive limestone caves.Lords of the Dance - Culture of the Cook Islands: Visual arts Carving A staff-god made of casuarina wood. Carving was an important part of ancient Cook Islands culture, although much of this is lost. Ancient Cook Islanders carved the poles of their huts, their canoes and weapons (clubs and spears). The patterns used were the same as that used in tattooing and dyed on tapa cloth. It is believed that families had their own symbols, much like some British families have crests.Arts & Craft Cook Islands: Build your love of art Staff God Cult figures called staff-gods or atua rakau from Rarotonga, apparently combine images of gods with their human descendants. They range in length between 28 inches (71 cm) and 18 feet (5.5 m) and were carried and displayed horizontally. At one end there is a schematized blade-shaped head and arms of the progenitive god with a succession of little figures rising from his body, alternatively full-face and in profile with penis erect. The staff itself terminated in a phallus. But this elaborately carved sexual imagery had less importance for the Rarotongans than the feathers and pieces of shell representing the soul of the god and enclosed in yards of bark cloth wound around the center of the staff.A world history of art by Hugh Honour & John Fleming (2005) Fisherman's god A number of images called the fisherman's god are found in museums. These images are likely to be of the sea god Tangaroa.Rarotonga & the Cook Islands by Errol Hunt & Nancy Keller, Cook Islands Myths and Legends: Gods Their function rests solely on the authority of John Williams, who figured one of them and referred to it thus: > \\"An idol, of which the figure on the opposite side is a correct > representation, was placed on the fore part of every fishing canoe; and when > the natives were going on a fishing expedition, prior to setting off, they > invariably presented offerings to the god, and invoked him to grant them > success.\\" Arts and Crafts of the Cook Islands: Religion - nzetc.org Weaving Weaved hand fan with a carved figure handle. The outer islands produce traditional weaving of fans, mats, basketware and hats. Particularly fine examples of rito hats are worn by women to church on Sundays. They are made from the uncurled fibre of the coconut palm and are of very high quality. The Polynesian equivalent of Panama hats, they are highly valued and are keenly sought by Polynesian visitors from Tahiti. Often, they are decorated with hatbands made of minuscule pupu shells which are painted and stitched on by hand. Although pupu are found on other islands, the collection and use of them in decorative work has become a speciality of Mangaia.Lords of the Dance - Culture of the Cook Islands: Crafts Tattoo Tattooing was forbidden in the Cook Islands after the arrival of missionaries, but has recently become popular again. Historically the Cook Islands tribes or clans each usually recognized a particular fish, bird, insect or plant that was sacred to that tribe and symbolized its unity. The ritual association requires members of the clan to treat the totem with respect. Its supernatural help could also be sought in times of distress. The symbol for the centipede with a poisonous bite is a common totem of chiefs and was normally tattooed on the chief's back. Captain James Cook recorded tatau as the Tahitian term when he arrived there in 1769, although tatau is not the only word for this art form. In some French Polynesian islands and some Cook Islands it was known as nana'o.Oceania tattoos: Cook Islands tattoos - janeresture.com Tivaevae Woman sewing a tīvaevae, Rarotonga. A major art form peculiar to the Cook Islands is tīvaevae. This is needlework, specifically the making of patchwork quilts by hand. The designs are stunning. These beautiful and intricate works are made by women. They have great intrinsic value and become family heirlooms. They are often given as gifts of love and friendship. They supplanted the traditional giving of tapa cloth on ceremonial occasions such as weddings, funerals and hair-cutting. Tivaevae is a communal activity and several women will work on them together. The original idea was introduced by the wives of missionaries from England and nuns from Tahiti who taught embroidery, needlework, sewing and crochet. Tivaevae has played an important role in the daily life of Cook Island women. Since it is largely a social activity, it is nearly always carried out communally, it has had a major impact on the lives of the many women who practise it. Despite its European origin, patterns and techniques have evolved into styles which now belong quite distinctly to the Cooks. The tivaevae reflect the women's surroundings and usually employ designs of flowers, leaves, birds, fish, insects and animals.Quilts of the Cook Islands: Tivaevae Contemporary art Contemporary Artists Eruera Nia and Tim Buchanan are featured at the new International Terminal, Rarotonga Airport. 36 of Nia's concrete casts are positioned throughout the terminal while Buchanan's 10 metre mural farewell's passengers as they are processed through customs and security.

He is the originator of a large number of bubble magic tricks now performed by entertainers around the world. In 1980, Noddy's performance was featured as a segment on an American television program On The Road With Charles Karault. In 1983, Noddy performed on American television's That's Incredible! and Johnny Carson's Tonight Show. He subsequently performed on the UK's Paul Daniels Magic Show, France's Incroyable Mais Vrai, Germany's Die verflixte Sieben with Rudi Carrell, Ireland's Pat Kenny Chat Show, Australia's Mike Walsh Show, Netherlands' De Bananasplit Show, Japan's Chikyū Donburi, Norway's Scantertainment and several others. Following the attention that this exposure brought to him, Noddy worked with San Francisco's Exploratorium to develop a Bubble Festival in 1983 that featured Noddy's performance and that of another bubble performer whom Noddy encountered in his travels. With octogenarian Eiffel G. Plasterer performing his Bubbles Concerto and Exploratorium exhibits highlighting the science of soap films and allowing the public to experiment with soap bubbles for themselves, the event attracted an estimated 15,000 people over a weekend in 1983. These appearances came after more than a decade of developing his skill with soap bubbles and inventing the tricks featured in his performances. In 1988, with Philadelphia's Running Press, Noddy's how-to book: Tom Noddy's Bubble Magic was published in the US and helped to inspire several other performers to turn their attention to soap bubbles. Some of Noddy's later television appearances included the Late Show with David Letterman (USA, February 27, 2007), and Germany's TV Total with Stefan Raab in 2009. Tom Noddy continues to bring his performance and science education to science centers in the US, Europe and other parts of the world (Abu Dhabi in November 2011). In August 2011, he featured in the BBC-TV programme The Code, presented by mathematician Marcus du Sautoy, where he demonstrated the ability of bubbles to form minimal surface structures.

The school is named after writer and activist June Jordan, whom Alice Walker called \\"the universal poet.\\" June Jordan School for Equity is a part of a nationwide small schools movement, with its parents and staff organized soon after the school was formed to work in helping SFUSD pass a district-wide Small Schools Policy. Mission JJSE’s mission is to prepare a diverse group of urban youth to be: Community: community members who show respect, integrity, courage, and humility Social Justice: agents of change in their school, their neighborhoods, and the world Independent Thinkers: intellectuals with the skills necessary to succeed in college and life History June Jordan School for Equity was founded in 2003 by Small Schools for Equity (SSE), a non-profit organization formed by a group of teachers, parents, and students who believed that San Francisco needed a new and innovative model of schooling. For two years before the school opened, the school’s founders studied successful urban schools across the country and worked with the San Francisco Organizing Project to cultivate a broad-based community organizing effort, through which the San Francisco Unified School District agreed to put forth a request for proposals for new and redesigned schools. SSE applied in partnership with San Francisco State University’s College of Education and was selected from among 30 applicants to open the new school. In August 2003, the new school opened with a ninth grade class at a temporary location on the campus of San Francisco State University, as the first high school to enjoy a formal partnership with a California State University. A year later, June Jordan School for Equity (a name chosen by the student body during the school’s first year) moves to its current location at the former Luther Burbank Middle School campus in the Excelsior District. In November 2005, facing severe budget cuts, SFUSD places JJSE on a list of schools that may be closed due to low enrollment, despite the fact that it is a small school by design. JJSE parents work with SFOP to support an event at Mission High School where over 1,300 people hear Mayor Gavin Newsom and school board members pledge to take JJSE off the closure list and work to pass a small schools policy. In June 2007, JJSE graduated its first class; 73% of graduates are admitted to four-year universities, compared to less than 50% nationwide. Demographics JJSE’s student body of about 250 students lives primarily in San Francisco’s southeast neighborhoods, where young people confront powerful socio-economic obstacles to academic success. These neighborhoods—the Excelsior, Visitacion Valley, Bayview/Hunters Point, and the Mission—are all working-class and low- income, with some of the highest concentrations of families with children in the city. At the same time, many of these communities are experiencing rapid gentrification, which is forcing long-time residents to leave the city and undermining community-based efforts to stem rising crime and violence. ; June Jordan School For Equity *Latino - 46% *Black - 33% *Chinese - 6% *Filipino - 6% *White - 4% *Other - 7% ; All SFUSD High Schools *Latino - 23% *Black - 10% *Chinese - 33% *White - 11% *Other - 10% *Filipino - 6% *American Indian - 1% *Japanese - 1% *Korean - 1% School design In order to meet the needs of low-skilled, marginalized students, JJSE has implemented a number of research- based program features as a small, redesigned school, including: *class size of 25 or less *core teacher pupil load of 100 or less *an advisory system, including frequent parent contact *all students take a-g university entrance requirements *partnerships with local colleges where students take university courses *a performance assessment (portfolio) system to create public accountability for student achievement *democratic decision-making and distributed staff leadership *significant built-in weekly professional development and staff collaboration time *a Wellness Center to address mental and physical health needs *a parent organizing committee to promote parent leadership and community-based accountability Pedagogy As a school for social justice serving a largely working-class, Latino and African-American student population, the mission of June Jordan School for Equity is not just to prepare students for college, but also to prepare its graduates to be agents of positive change in the world. Its pedagogy is expressly designed to help its students understand the forces of marginalization they have experienced growing up, and thus to begin the process of freeing themselves from oppression, including especially the internalized oppression (or self- imposed limits) which prevent so many students from meeting their potential. JJSE is in the process of clearly defining its pedagogy in order to support JJSE teachers on their path to becoming masters at the art of teaching for social justice, which in turn will provide all JJSE students the opportunity to develop the self-confidence and self-discipline they need to become not just authentic intellectuals, but also leaders who will work on behalf of their communities and create a more just and humane world.

Lotz. It denotes the period that followed an earlier network era, television's first institutional phase that started in the 1950s and ran through to the mid-1980s, and television's later multi- channel transition.Lotz, Amanda D. (2007) \\"The Television Will Be Revolutionized\\". New York, NY: New York University Press It describes a period that saw the deterioration of the dominance of the Big Three television networks: ABC, CBS and NBC, and follows the creation of a wide variety of cable television channels that catered specifically to niche groups. The post- network era saw the development of networks that deliver a wider diversity of programming choice, less constraints on a consumers choice of medium, decentralization of the location of viewing, and freedom of choice over time of viewing. For Amanda D. Lotz, the post-network era has been defined by five C's: \\"choice, control, convenience, customization, and community\\". These five concepts, which have defined the post-network era, all relate to the ways in which viewers have greater access to a wider array of content which can be consumed on their own terms. The concept comes from the field of Television studies, and has been used by various academics to discuss numerous different topics. The concept has been endorsed by media scholar Henry Jenkins, co- director of the Media Industries Project Michael Curtin, and American Studies, and Film and Media professor Jason Mittell. Major Developments Vast modifications were made to the way in which the television industry was operated following the earlier Network Era and a period of Multi-channel transition. The major factor governing the transition to a post-network paradigm was a computational and generational shift in the audience. These emergent developments in the post-network era have led television audiences to split attention between many different channels, devices, and forms of media as Television programs are no longer confined to the Television set. Timeshifting Technologies The development of technologies with timeshifting abilities such as the VCR and DVR rendered broadcast times irrelevant, and also shifted discussion away from simple differentiation between cable and free-to-air television. Although much of this technological change coincided with the Multi-channel transition, its effect can be felt well into the post-network era, creating the groundwork for future technological developments including Hulu and Netflix On-Demand. Digitization of Content The increasing digitization of content has presented viewers with an increasing level of access to high quality televisual content on DVD and online. This has fostered the development of new portable methods of delivering media that help to bring television to spaces outside of the home. Consequently, multiple new revenue streams have emerged as television networks are able to sell shows through online storefronts like iTunes. The DVD market, too, has become a financially viable place to extract additional profits from television shows post-broadcast. In the case of Family Guy, this even led to the show's renewal in 2005 due to strong DVD sales, four years after its initial cancellation. Changes to Advertising In order to reap the benefits of advertising in an era where television programs are no longer necessarily watched first-run on network television station, advertisers have innovated, using product placement in more popular television shows and producing their own branded entertainment, a form of media in which the content and advertising messages are inextricably linked. This differs from traditional advertising practices that only saw the broadcast of a number of 30-second adverts in chunks during pre-planned ad-breaks. Web 2.0 Technologies A major aspect of the post-network era has been the development of new technologies that change the ways in which television is consumed and distributed. These technological changes have come about with the invention of the tablet, the use of smart phones, web-enabled devices connected to the television like many modern gaming consoles saw the subsequent development and wide uptake of online VOD services like Netflix and Hulu, as well as specific, network-branded streaming services. This shift in technology created a new-found level of convenience and mobility for viewers, as television trends towards a situation in which you can watch \\"whatever show you want, whenever you want, on whatever screen you want\\". Amanda D. Lotz argues that technologies like Netflix and NBC, Fox, and ABC's own Hulu have clearly impacted the way in which we access television, allowing us to catch up on television shows whenever we please rather than adhering to a first run schedule. Hulu also allows for interaction between fans of television shows while they are watching episodes through the site's inbuilt comment feature, creating the sort of immersive media experience and fostering a participatory culture of affiliation, two major interests of Henry Jenkins. This technological change also brings a change in theatricality, as television producers respond to the ways in which their audiences watch television.  Content in the Post-Network Era  One major development in the post-network era has been a fragmented cable network system, with each network presenting contents to cater to specific target audiences rather than a homogeneous mass audience. Magazines had done this for similar reasons a century earlier. As consumers began to watch television programs on tablets and cell phones in their own time, niche channels emerged from the expansion of cable television networks, advertising became integrated into television shows rather than ad- breaks, and people were no longer tied to a 24-week first-run broadcast cycle. Producers responded to changing consumption patterns by changing the ways in which they produce television content, which resulted in the creation of shows like Sex and the City, Breaking Bad and Arrested Development (which aired on network television) with features that were unrepresentative of those developed in the Network era and during the Multi-channel transition.

Gregg Gardner, Kevin Lee Osterloh - 2008 \\"Although the activities of the two are paralleled, Paul is celebrated as the apostle responsible for Christianity's worldwide spread, while Peter is associated with the early mission to the Jews\\" An important 2nd century source is the Dialogue with Trypho of Justin Martyr (c.140) which may be partially fictionalized, and \\"Trypho\\" may be a cypher for rabbi Tarfon but otherwise shows a level playing field and mutual respect as each participant appeals to the other.Anti-Judaism in Early Christianity: Separation and polemic ed. Peter Richardson, David M. Granskou, Stephen G. Wilson 1986 p75 \\"Still, Justin's respect for his learned opponent is apparent throughout the Dialogue, and he is willing to give Trypho the benefit of the doubt on his motivations (65. 2-3).\\" After Constantine From Constantine I, when Christianity became the official religion of the Roman empire, the position of Christians to Jews changed. Some laws were instituted which protected the rights of Jewish converts from disinheritance, other laws also protected from abuse of the privileges of conversion from those who converted from Judaism \\"only for a cancellation of debt;\\" which suggests that in some areas of the empire local incentives to conversion existed.Stemberger Accounts of conversion itself are not mentioned in rabbinical sources and are not frequent in Christian sources - excepting Epiphanius of Salamis' account of the conversion of Count Joseph of Tiberias, and Sozomen's accounts of Jewish conversions in Constantinople.Günter Stemberger Jews and Christians in the Holy Land: Palestine in the fourth century 2000 \\"For example, Sozomen reports that in Constantinople (under Constantine?) countless Jews also converted to Christianity.92 The question remains to what extent it could still be expected of Jewish converts of this period that they should join a Jewish Christian congregation. Would they not rather attempt to make a radical break with their past? The Judaizers mentioned again and again, for example, in Jerome, are not automatically Jewish Christians.\\" Medieval During the medieval period conversions in Christian ruled lands were often conducted by force, such as in the case of the Alhambra Decree of 1492 leading to the conversos, those converted by force, and Marranos. In Muslim lands dialogue between Jews and Christians was more equal, and Jewish apologists were able to refute Christians openly. In Christian lands those such as Hasdai Crescas (c.1340–1411) could only write refutations of Christian belief at great risk. After the Reformation The Reformation in Europe did not immediately give rise to increased proselytism to Jews, in part due to Luther's antisemitism and Calvin's indifference.Dr. Edward Kessler, Neil Wenborn A dictionary of Jewish-Christian relations p298 2005 \\"John Calvin did not consider mission to Jews an urgent priority in his early ministry, partly because he worked in an area with few Jews.\\" 18th and 19th centuries In 1809 Joseph Frey (born Joseph Levi) founded the London Society for promoting Christianity amongst the Jews after disagreements with the generic London Missionary Society. This was later renamed the London Jews' Society and then the Church's Ministry Among Jewish People. Among their missionaries was the grammarian C. W. H. Pauli (born Zebi Nasi Hirsch Prinz). After Frey's group, which was largely led by converted Jews, the generic missionary organisations also attempted more culturally sensitive efforts and in 1841 the Church of Scotland appointed a Gentile missionary, John Duncan to the Jews of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to be based in Budapest.Missionary register Church Missionary Society - 1841 \\"Dr. Duncan, the first Missionary to the Jews appointed by the Committee, will proceed in a few months, with two Missionary Students, to Pest, in Hungary\\" At the same time \\"John Nicolayson\\" (the Dane Hans Nicolajsen), bishop Michael Solomon Alexander, and other missionaries were sent to Palestine.Yaron Perry British mission to the Jews in nineteenth-century Palestine 2003 p22 \\"STRIKING ROOT A new era dawned in the history of the London Society in Palestine with the arrival of John Nicolayson (his original name was Hans Nicolajsen).\\". Responses came such as Louis Stern's Anti-Jewish Conversionist Society of Birmingham.The Church of England Magazine 1872 \\"A discussion was subsequently arranged to be held at the Anti-Jewish Conversionist Society's rooms, between Mr. Wolkenborg and Mr. Louis Stern, president of that society.

It was soon expelled from the American Board of Missions to the Jews, and Messianic Judaism was condemned by the Fellowship of Christian Testimonies to the Jews in 1975. Jewish responses Initial Jewish responses to Christian activity are seen in reports (through Christian eyes) of the response of the priestly authorities in the Book of Acts, through mentions of Jesus in the Talmud, then in rabbinical texts, as documented by Steven T. Katz in The Rabbinic Response to Christianity (2006).p259 onwards, chapter 11 of The Cambridge History of Judaism Vol.4: The late Roman-Rabbinic period ed. William David Davies, Louis Finkelstein, Steven T. Katz. During the Middle Ages rabbinical scholars combatted missionary activity with works such as Ibn Shaprut's Touchstone. In modern times, for example in response to Rosen's group, Jews for Judaism and other groups were founded.

It is based on the 1994 film of the same title and takes place after the events of the film. Despite the use of digitized actors to portray the characters in the game, Jean-Claude Van Damme was not used to pose as protagonist Max Walker. Levels range from locales in the past (e.g., New York City during the 1920s, the European front of World War II), the present day, and a dystopian Los Angeles of the distant future. Although the game was only released for the Super NES, a version was also developed for the Sega CD, with a short demo being distributed in May 1995 alongside the European Sega Pro magazine. Despite being fully completed by the developer, JVC pulled off the Sega CD version publishing and it remained unreleased. In 2007, a complete version of the game was eventually released on the Internet by the Sega CD version coder. Gameplay The player is in futuristic Los Angeles and is about to fight a punk. Players must stop the original inventor of time travel, Dr. Hans Kleindast, and must fix all the wrong things that Kleindast does in the game. There are 15 levels in all; most of them are standard platforming levels. Some levels involve the use of a player-controlled vehicle and use of martial arts. A time limit is in effect for all 15 levels of the game; resulting in instant death and the loss of a life if the timer reaches 0:00. Reception On release, Famitsu magazine scored the game a 20 out of 40.New Games Cross Review - タイムコップ. Weekly Famitsu. No.323. Pg.38. 24 February 1995.

Sloan and Barri chose a San Francisco band to become the Grass Roots. The band consisted of lead singer/lead guitarist Willie Fulton, rhythm guitarist Denny Ellis, bassist David Stensen and drummer Larson. The band quickly had no shortage of live performances, as they became a resident band at the Los Angeles club \\"The Trip\\" and made frequent appearances at San Francisco's Avalon Ballroom. They also supported the Dunhill artists The Mamas and the Papas, Johnny Rivers and Barry McGuire on their TV performances. However, with the exception of Fulton's vocals and Larson on drums, they did not appear on the Grass Roots records, which featured Sloan and various session musicians. The band's single version of Bob Dylan's \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\" (issued under the name \\"Mr. Jones\\") only reached the lower reaches of the Billboard Magazine charts, peaking at #121 in late 1965. A new single of \\"Where Were You When I Needed You\\", with Fulton's voice replacing Sloan's as the lead vocal, was finally released in June 1966 and reached the Top 40, peaking at #28. But that success was too late for the band members, who were frustrated by Dunhill's reluctance to let them record as a band. Although much of the first album had already been recorded at that time, the band (except for Larson) decided to return to San Francisco in early 1966.Andrew Sandoval, liner notes for Where Were You When I Needed You, July 1994 After the band quit, Sloan once again took over as lead singer of the Grass Roots sessions, as he had been on the original demos. Sloan stated that Dunhill policy at the time required albums to include \\"other people's hits\\" that \\"they were trying to get into stores\\", which is why the album does not only feature Sloan and Barri originals. Because there was no longer a band for TV appearances or live concerts, Sloan and Barri were never able to continue the success of \\"Where Were You When I Needed You\\". The twelve track vinyl album featured three songs sung by Fulton and the rest by Sloan, including Sloan's single version of \\"Where Were You When I Needed You\\". It failed to chart. Fulton later was guitarist and vocalist in Tower of Power on their albums East Bay Grease (1970), Bump City (1972), Direct (1981) and Power (1987). Larson played with Gene Clark, The Merry-Go-Round, The Turtles and Lee Michaels before returning to the Grass Roots in 1971. Ellis and Stensen joined a San Francisco group named The Serpent Power led by Beat poet David Meltzer and his wife Tina. They released a self-titled album in 1967. In 1994, the original CD version of the album was released on Varèse Sarabande. It included six bonus tracks. Five were sung by Fulton and one titled \\"Tip of My Tongue\\" by Sloan. This CD version of the album included a total of ten songs sung by Sloan and eight songs sung by Fulton. In 2005, an English CD reissue on Rev-Ola Records included all of the previous tracks plus two more bonus tracks. They were the second and third vocal versions of \\"Where Were You When I Needed You\\" sung by Fulton first and then by the most famous Grass Roots lead singer Rob Grill.

It was built between late 14th and early 15th centuries. In 1920, two of its elements, the facade and the cloister, were designated as national monuments. R.O. Education and Arts Ministry of Spain, June 19, published in the official bulletin in June 24, 1920. Its present designation is Bien de Interés Cultural. Registration as Bien de Interés Cultural in Culture Ministry of Spain.  History  View of northern church front. View from Main Square. In 1392, a wooden sculpture of Mary was discovered buried, probably hidden since the Muslim invasion, in a piece of open ground at the municipality of Nieva, where the village of Santa María de Nieva sits now. Antonio Miguel Yurami y Antonio Sánchez Sierra (1995), Historia de la aparición de la taumaturga ymagen de nuestra Señora la Soterraña de Nieva. P. 48. This fact was considered a miracle, and the Queen Catherine of Lancaster ordered the building of a sanctuary there and a village around it, to the worship of that Virgin's image, called Soterraña, an old Spanish word that means 'subterranean'. Soterraño Royal Spanish Academy's dicctionary. She did it against the opinions of the priest of Nieva, who wanted to bring the image to his village, and nobility of Segovia who preferred moving it to the town.Antonio Miguel Yurami y Antonio Sánchez Sierra (1995), Historia de la aparición de la taumaturga ymagen de nuestra Señora la Soterraña de Nieva. pp. 59-66. However, the Queen acquired two papal bulls from Clement VII, in February 1393, to release the sanctuary from the Nieva priest's jurisdiction, and getting indulgences for the visitors on certain days. alt=  Original church construction (1393-1399)  Queen Catherine defrayed a large part of the building with Crown funds, many worshipers also contributed with their own money for the works, and these contributions were increased by two new bulls of Pope Benedict XII, in 1395, giving indulgences to those who gave money for the construction.National History Archive of Spain Sec. Clerecy. File 1951. Documents 12 and 13. The original church was rectangular, divided into three naves, and faced towards East as was traditional in that time. The every-day door was at the northern wall, and there was another door at western wall used just on holy days. On February 2, 1399, at Toledo, the Queen gave the custody of the image and the temple to the Dominican Order, that officially accepted it on September 7.A. M. Yurami p. 71  Enlargement (1414-1432)  Southern corridor of the cloister. Apse added during the enlargement. In 1395, Santa María la Real de Nieva village had been founded by Royal order.A. M. Yurami p. 63 The number of inhabitants grew quickly along with the number of visitor, and so the need for enlargement. Work started on January 23, 1414, and ended in 1432. These dates are known by three inscriptions located on church transept columns. In this extension of the church, another nave was added along with a transept and an apse, in parallel with the construction of the monastery attached. Queen Catherine of Lancaster sponsored these works until her death in 1418, and her son King John II of Castile continued the task. A. Sánchez Sierra p. 43 The next popes, Clement VII, Benedict XIII of Avignon, and Martin V, also contributed, giving indulgences to those who donated money for the building. Also, Martin V gave 500 florins of his own fund in 1425.  Events  Blanche I of Navarre's tomb. On April 1, 1441, Queen Blanche I of Navarre was passing by the village on her way to a meeting with Prince Henry, his father King John II of Castile, and King John II of Aragon, when the Queen died, being buried at Nuetra Señora de la Soterraña church's main chapel. Her body stayed there, despite of her last will of resting in Ujué. Enrique Flórez (1751), Memorias de las reinas católicas de España p. 725 Nerea Alejos.

Edited by the Town Hall. After Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendizábal, monks left the monastery and its property was divided between the Segovia bishopric and the Santa María la Real de Nieva's Town Hall. Monasterie guide p.150 In late 19th century, the monument suffered two fires. The first one, in 1899, affected the southern wing of the monastery and the second was at the high altar of the church.A.M. Sánchez Sierra p. 144 The monument has been restored a number of times, the façade in 1927 and the cloister in 1929, 1954, and 1976.A. M. Sánchez Sierra p. 145.  Church  Building plan; church (blue) and monastery (red). The church was built following early 15th-century Gothic structure canons in Spain. Its decorative style has been described as archaic,Antonio Sánchez Sierra (1992), p. 62 because it is influenced by Romanesque art that was present in the Kingdom of Castile until the late 14th century. The main body of the church consists of three naves, the middle one being wider and higher than the side ones. This structure fits in with the original church. Its slate masonry walls have granite ashlar foundations and corners. However, inside the columns were built using bricks. In the middle there is a small cave where the Virgin's image was found. Church transept Later, another nave, with a transept and one apse with two side chapels, was added. This new part was totally built with ashlar walls. There are mason's marks of 22 different workshops in its walls,Monastery guide p. 87 that indicates the large number of workers used in the construction. When this part was finished, the old east wall in between was demolished to incorporate the new nave into the building. In the back central nave, there is a choir loft whose wall are lined with carved wooden chairs. The ceiling under the loft is decorated with a mudéjar wooden coffer. There is a mural painting of Saint Christopher carrying the child Jesus in the southern wing, discovered during a restoration in 1997.  Facade  Gothic church facade The most notable of the church's elements is the facade in the northern wall, opening just under the transept, that is designated as bien de interés cultural itself. It was made in Gothic style with many reliefs and sculptures. It is divided into two bands with an ogival arch. In the upper part, there is a tympanum with an entrenched Christ image, in between two currently beheaded figures, probably the King and Queen that sponsored the building, and two angels. Above there are the Sun and the Moon representing the Universe, and angels on clouds. The tympanum is surrounded by five archivolts that depict, from outside to inside: * resurrection of the dead, with 34 figures beside their tombs; * 16 female saints; * 14 male saints; * 12 kneeling archangels with torches; * 10 seraphs guarding the tympanum's Christ. The lintel over the door had three carved slabs, but the central one that depicted the Last Judgment is lost. The right slab depicts Hell into whose fish-mouth-shaped entrance persons enter. The left one depicts Heaven with Saint Peter in its gate receiving another person. This slab is held with two corbels with allegorical figures. The left one is a griffin, as a symbol of evil, carrying a hare that represents sin. And the right cobel is lion-shaped, as a symbol of goodness, protecting a naked woman with its paws, that depicts concupiscence. Under the facade arch there are many scenes depicting the Passion.  Monastery  Cloister view from bell tower. All the monastery rooms are placed around its cloister and open to it. In the eastern wing there are a chapter house, currently used as an exhibition room and the Queen's dormitory on the second floor, that is a library at present. In the southern wing there is the Court Hall, where King Henry IV called a meeting of the Courts of Castile in 1473, next to the refectory. Under the refectory, there is a subterranean warehouse. There was a fire in the southern wing of old monastery on December 6, 1899, that destroyed some of the old rooms – another smaller cloister, the library, stables and barns, that were not reconstructed, and later that piece of land was sold. Arches of the cloister southern corner. Every cloister capital is decorated in a different way.  Cloister  The cloister plan is almost square and is attached to the church by its southern wall, where there is a door that connects both sides. The cloister probably was built simultaneously with the church enlargement, as indicated by coincident mason's marks carved in their stones. There are 17 piers raised on one-yard high, limestone ashlar walls. Between each pair of piers there are groups of 3, 4 or 5 ogival arches, a total of 68. There is no wall in the south-western corner forming a pair of three arch gates to access into the central garden. The cloister structure is held by 11 big buttresses, and two smaller ones placed in its entrance. Each column is carved in a sole piece as two cylinders linked by a bevel withstanding a capital decorated with reliefs. Every capital is decorated in a different way. Unlike the facade, cloister capitals have very few biblical depictions. The main themes used in their decoration are scenes of the Middle Age monks and people's way of life, nature, monsters, and coats of arms.

Pre 2010 variant. Reverse of the Medal of Zhukov. Post 2010 variant. The Medal of Zhukov () is a state award of the Russian Federation initially awarded to veterans of the Great Patriotic War but now awarded to serving members of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. It is named in honour of Marshal of the Soviet Union Georgy Zhukov, the most decorated general in the history of the Soviet Union.  Award History  The Medal of Zhukov was established on May 9, 1994 by Decree of the President of the Russian Federation No 930. The medal's statute was defined on December 30, 1995 by Decree of the President of the Russian Federation No 1334. The initial statute of the award stated the medal was to be awarded to military and civilian veterans of the Red Army, the Navy, of NKVD troops, guerrillas and members of the underground, for bravery, fortitude and courage displayed in fighting against the Nazi invaders or the Japanese militarists, and to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Georgy Zhukov. The basis for award of the medal was simple proof of direct participation in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945 as part of the army, or in combat against Japan. It could also be awarded to servicemen of the Ministry of Defence and other ministries and departments, in which Russian law provides for military service, for courage and bravery displayed in combat operations in defence of the Motherland and the public interests of the Russian Federation. Although established in Russia, the Medal of Zhukov was later adopted by and also established in all of the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States by decision of the Council of the Heads of State of May 26, 1995.  Award Statute  Decree of the President of the Russian Federation No 1099 of September 7, 2010 completely revamped the Russian state awards system including a new statute for the Medal of Zhukov. The Medal of Zhukov is now awarded to soldiers for bravery, selflessness and personal courage in fighting for the protection of the Motherland and the public interests of the Russian Federation, for distinction in military bearing during service, for alertness and active participation in exercises and manoeuvres, for excellent performance in combat training. The Russian Federation Order of Precedence dictates the Medal of Zhukov is to be worn on the left breast with other medals immediately after the Medal of Ushakov.  Award Description  The Medal of Zhukov is a circular, 32mm in diameter brass medal. On the obverse, the bust of marshal Zhukov, his head half turned to the right, on his uniform, four stars of Hero of the Soviet Union and a Marshal's Star around his neck. Below the bust along the medal's lower circumference, two branches of oak and laurels. Above the bust, along the medal's upper circumference, the relief inscription \\"GEORGY ZHUKOV\\" (in Russian \\"ГЕОРГИЙ ЖУКОВ\\"). The medal's original reverse, as mandated by Decree of the President of the Russian Federation of March 6, 1995 No 243, bore at its center the large relief years \\"1896 - 1996\\" and oak and laurel branches at the bottom following the medal's lower circumference. Some makers produced a variant of the medal with a smaller inscription (1896 - 1996) and added a relief \\"N\\" and a line for an award serial number. More than 2.5 million were awarded. Following the 2010 amendment to its statute, the reverse of the Medal of Zhukov now bears the relief inscription \\"FOR EXCELLENCE IN SERVICE\\" (in Russian \\"ЗА ОТЛИЧИЕ В СЛУЖБЕ\\") in the center, below the inscription, a relief \\"N\\" and a line for an award serial number. At the bottom, along the medal's lower circumference, oak and laurel branches. The medal is suspended to a standard Russian pentagonal mount by a ring through the medal's suspension loop. The mount is covered by an overlapping 24mm wide silk moiré ribbon, the left half of the ribbon is red, the right half of the ribbon is in the colours of the Ribbon of Saint George.

Historical examples Most of the species within Hawaii cannot truly be classified as native species since Hawaii is a group of islands; therefore, all, or most, of the species had to migrate there or be brought over to the islands by humans. However, there are a majority of species which were introduced for specific reasons yet they have disrupted Hawaiian biodiversity. The mongoose was introduced to Hawaii in the mid-19th century in an attempt to control the large rat population in the sugar cane fields. However, since then, the mongoose population has grown to large numbers without controlling the nocturnal rat population and has greatly diminished the population of ground nesting birds. Another example of an invasive species introduced in the 19th century is the fire tree, which is a small shrub that was brought from the Azores, Madeira, and the Canary Islands as an ornamental plant or for firewood. However, now it poses a serious threat to native plants on young volcanic sites, lowland forests, and shrublands, where it forms dense monocultural stands Another plant, the strawberry guava, was introduced in the early 19th century as an edible fruit. However, it now poses a major threat to Hawaii's rare endemic flora and fauna by forming shade-casting thickets with dense mats of surface feeder roots. Potential harm from invasive species Invasive species threaten biodiversity by causing disease, acting as predators or parasites, acting as competitors, altering habitat, or hybridizing with local species. Disease Invasive species often carry new diseases for native species. For example, the biting fly in Hawaii are small, even tiny, and include many species, some of which are vectors of diseases while others bite and cause considerable nuisance and health-related problems. The introduction of mosquitoes to Hawaii has resulted in the spread of avian malaria, and increases the risk of dengue and west Nile virus (not known to be in Hawaii yet). Other native species can be affected by invasive species diseases as well, such as the once-dominant koa tree being killed by koa wilt, which is believed to have been brought into Hawaii on an ornamental acacia plant,Friday, J. B., and Nicholas Dudley. \\"Hawai'i Forestry Extension: Koa wilt.\\" Hawai'i Forestry Extension: Koa wilt. University of Hawaii, 31 Mar. 2013. Web. 23 Oct. 2014. and the 'ohi'a tree, now being affected by Rapid Ohia Death. Predators Invasive predators can severely reduce the population sizes of native species, or even drive them extinct, because native prey species may not have evolved defenses against the novel predators. Competition Oftentimes the introduced species is better equipped to survive and competes with the native species for food or other resources. For example, the strawberry guava tree is one of Hawaii's worst invasive species. It is dangerous because it crowds out native plant species, breaks up natural areas, disrupts native animal communities, alters native ecosystem processes like water production, and provides refuge for alien fruit flies that are a major pest of Hawaiian agriculture. Habitat alteration Invasive species can change the state of an environment in many ways based on how they feed and interact with their new surroundings. These interactions along with competition can limit the amount and type of resources for native species. Hybridization Hybridization occurs when members of two different species mate with one another and produce viable offspring that carry genes from both parents. When an invasive species is much more abundant than a native relative, they may hybridize so often that the invaders genes \\"flood\\" the native species, such that no individuals contain the entire genotype of the native species, thus effectively driving the native species to extinction. For example, hybridization between Introduced mallards and the native Hawaiian duck (koloa maoli) and between the rarest European duck (the white-headed duck) and the invasive North American ruddy duck may result in the extinction of the native species. Cultural Practice Impacts In Hawaii, the Hawaiian culture is closely connected to its environment and native species. Chants, ceremonies, hula, and other practices involve the use of plants (both native and Polynesian-introduced), traditional access to places of importance, and other activities that can be directly affected by invasive species. For example, taro (kalo, in Hawaiian) is defined in the Hawaiian Creation Chant as the plant from which Hawaiians were formed and is considered a sacred plant. The introduction of the golden apple snail, which attacks taro, threatens the very existence of Hawaiian ancestors. Threats to Hawaii's ecosystems Hawaii has a growing invasive species crisis affecting the islands' endangered plants and animals, overall environmental and human health, and the viability of its tourism and agriculture-based economy. Invasive species occur globally, but Hawaii is more susceptible to invasive species because it is an island. The entire island chain of Hawaii has been devastated by invasive insects, plants, hoofed animals such as deer, goats and pigs and others pests. Feral pigs eat endangered bird's eggs and trample fragile native plants, rosy wolfsnails from Africa gorge themselves on the island's native snails, weeds such as Australian tree fern and Miconia calvescens plants shade out native plants, and coqui tree frogs aggravate tourists, eat native insects and decrease home values with their piercing calls. Invasive aquatic species The threat of invasive species to Hawaii's coral reefs is very concerning. Hawaii's economy relies on their coral reefs for an estimate $10 million tourism business. Freshwater invasive species also threaten Hawaii's ecosystems. In 2003 Lake Wilson was invaded with the floating water fern Salvinia. The invasive fern competed with native species and fish. It has cost the state over $1 million to clean up the lake. Freshwater fish have also spread. Due to sport fishermen, species like trout, bass, and other fish have been introduced to lakes and streams in Hawaii . Also, people released pet fish like guppies, suckermouth catfish, and swordtails in local bodies of water. The suckermouth catfish burrow into the ground, thus harming the local wildlife. Even seemingly harmless guppies can spread disease to native gobies. Invasive insects & arachnids Insects can have major impacts on Hawaii's ecology, crops, and human health. Populations of introduced little fire ants in Hawaii can have major negative impacts on animals, crops, and humans. These small ants can provide a painful sting and are known to attack in swarms. Little fire ants are native to Central and South America, they were introduced to Hawaii on imported plants. A major threat to Hawaiian crops is the coffee berry borer. It has been known to destroy entire crops of coffee, but some farmers have been able to fight off these pests with pesticides and other measures, while others are finding that the borer is developing resistance to pesticides. It is not known at this time exactly how the pest was introduced to Hawaii but Hawaii's Department of Agriculture in cooperation with the University of Hawaii are investigating how the species arrived to Hawaii and how it can be eradicated. The coconut rhinoceros beetle or Asiatic rhinoceros beetle was first detected in Hawaii on the golf course at Joint Base Pearl Harbor in December 2013. This large beetle feeds on the growing shoots at the tops of coconut trees damaging the emerging leaves and providing opportunities for infection with plant pathogens. The Hawaii Department of Agriculture, USDA, and University of Hawaii are actively working on eradicating the beetle. Another insect that is threatening Hawaii's economy is the small hive beetle, which has been destroying bee hives and honey production throughout the islands. The infestation does not only harm commercial honey production but also wild bee populations and their ability to pollinate plants. This could lead to major ecological problems if current trends are not reverted. In Hawaii, the brown widow spider has also been established, along with the brown violin spider, Asian spinyback spider, and the pale leaf spider. The spiders snuck on bananas from tropical regions to get to Hawaii. Invasive terrestrial chordates Terrestrially, invasive species are proving to be a major difficulty in Hawaii because the islands lack many natural predators of invasive animals. Invasive predators often move to the top of the food chain and disrupt prey populations, particularly small mammals, birds, insects, and plants. The veiled chameleon and the Jackson's chameleon have also been found in Hawaii. They originally came to Hawaii through the pet trade in the 1970s despite Hawaii's laws against the importing or transporting of chameleons, lizards or snakes. Jackson's and veiled chameleons eat mostly insects but also leaves, flowers, small mammals and birds. Hawaii's ecosystems are especially damaged by chameleons hunting and eating patterns, lack of natural predators, and ability to adapt to the various conditions throughout Hawaii. They have a great impact on the ecology of Hawaii. Another threat to Hawaii's ecosystems is a frog called the coqui frog. It makes loud noises, eats native bugs, and is a potential food source for the brown tree snake. Hawaii is also aggressively fighting to prevent the invasion of the brown tree snake. The snake has caused major economic and ecological problems in Guam. The snake has destroyed bird, bat, and lizard populations and caused several human disruptions including large numbers of snake bites and power outages from climbing electrical wires. It is estimated that if the species gets into Hawaii it could cost Hawaii up to $123 million. There is a great fear that the species will be transported over to Hawaii from Guam ships and will have the same impact there. Isolated numbers of brown snakes have already been recorded on or around cargo ships into Hawaii. The feral pig is also a major threat to Hawaii's natural ecology. Feral pigs that were originally released or escaped from farms have been breeding in the wild and creating a large population of wild pigs in Hawaii. They have major impacts on the ecology because they are very destructive of plants and habitat and lack predators. Their burrowing patterns also destroy bird nesting grounds and lead to erosion. In remote, mountainous areas, they destroy the nests of seabirds including Newell's shearwater (Puffinus newelli) and Hawaiian petrel (Pterodroma sandwichensis). These burrows also create standing pools of feces infested water that serve as ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Many native Hawaiian birds are dying because of diseases transmitted by increasing numbers of mosquitoes. Economic impact The economic impact of allowing Invasive species to continue to propagate and spread throughout Hawaii poses severe risks for various Hawaiian industries central to the state's economy. According to a Legislative State Reference Bureau study from 2002, snails, insects and viruses that are nonnative have threatened the resurgence of the taro root crops which is an estimated 2 million dollar industry in the state. The taro aphid, which attacks plants in dry land taro crops, causes a 90% crop loss rate, devastating local farmers. The only way to effectively combat an infestation of invasive pest species is to remove all taro root from the area for one year further exacerbating the economic impact of the pest. The papaya industry, which comprises the 5th largest commodity in the state and takes in 16 million dollars annually, has also been affected by invasive species. The Papaya ringspot virus has killed trees and ruins marketable fruit. Furthermore, with the introduction of fruit flies to Hawaii, fruit fly-free markets like Japan and California have restricted trade thus cutting off an estimated 300 million dollars of potential markets. Sugarcane processing facility Since 1985, four varieties of insect pests have attacked the sugar cane industry and cost farmers more than 9 million dollars. Rats and rodents have also attacked sugar cane crops throughout the islands causing between 6 and 10 million dollars in damages annually in the 1990s. In addition, invasive rats and rodents consume approximately 5-10% of the lucrative macadamia nut crop causing \\"1.8 – 3.6 million dollars of direct agricultural damages\\" to the industry. Mongooses were introduced to the island in the late 19th century as a way to control rodent populations. Since then, the mongoose has failed to effectively control rat populations while driving native birds and insects to extinction and preying on local poultry. This is an example of the difficulty of combating invasive species as seemingly quick and cost effective solutions have complicated effects on the local ecosystem. Another example was the introduction of the Indian myna, an animal meant to combat the spread of sugar cane eating worms. An unforeseen consequence of this introduction has been the introduction and rapid spread of seeds of an invasive weed, the Lantana camara. Thus, considering the potential economic harm illustrated in the examples above, the problem of combating invasive species is a \\"recurring legislative concern.\\" In order to eradicate the threats of current invasive species and to understand the risks of new invasive species, the legislature would need approximately 50 million dollars in funding annually. Currently, funding to battle invasive species is only 10-15% of needed levels with an additional 6% being contributed by federal sources. Considering the elevated costs, particularly in the depressed economy, government should focus on ongoing funding from dedicated sources as well as concentrating on prevention. The Hawaii Invasive Species Council In response to the 2002 state legislature reference bureau report, which identified the gaps in invasive species action funding and the risks posed by invasive species, the Hawaii Invasive Species Council (HISC) was formed. The HISC is co-chaired by the Department of Land and Natural Resources and the Department of Agriculture and also includes the membership of the University of Hawaii, the Hawaiian Department of Business and Economic Development and Tourism, the Hawaii Department of Health and the Hawaii Department of Transportation. The HISC is composed of five working groups chaired by member agencies dealing with prevention, established pest management, public awareness, research and technology and natural resources. The HISC provides \\"policy level direction, coordination and planning among state departments, federal agencies and international and local initiatives for the control and eradication of invasive species.\\" The HISC seeks to \\"maintain a comprehensive overview of issues and supports state wide invasive species prevention, early detection and control programs\\" in the effort to provide a testing ground for innovation in methods and capacity to address invasive species which can be adopted permanently by other funded agencies. HISC partners and major funding recipients include the Island Invasive Species Committees (ISCs). These grant- funded Committees leverage HISC funding with Federal, other state, county, and private funding to address priority invasive species that threaten their county (island). The ISCs are partnerships between government agencies (Federal, State, and County), nongovernment agencies, private business, and local landowners. Each committee (KISC, OISC, MISC, MoMISC, and BIISC) focuses on protecting their island from invasive pests by utilizing prevention, early detection, rapid response, and control methodology supported by a paid staff and field crew. The goal of the ISCs is to protect agriculture, valuable watersheds, human health and quality of life, Hawaiian cultural practices, and Hawaii's unique biodiversity. Currently, funding for the HISC is under 4 million dollars following a 50% state funding reduction due to tightening budget from poor economic conditions. The promised 2 million dollars for the program in the current state budget is also subject to reduction pending budget shortfalls in the state treasury which could further affect the effort to combat invasive species in the state.

In his young life Broger, a graduate from Southern California Bible College, became a missionary practicing his faith in Southeast Asia after serving as a Naval Reservist and Warrant Officer in the Intelligence and Electronics Branch on the aircraft carrier Bon Homme Richard. After his demobilization Broger returned to the States to apply his theological passions and incorporated the Far East Broadcasting Company (FEBC) - a Christian radio ministry broadcasting Christian programs into Asia in Los Angeles, California with Robert H. Bowman and Pastor William J Roberts on December 20, 1945. Permission by the Philippine government insisted that FEBC begin broadcasting by June 4, 1948 and despite funding issues the station went on the air with the radio staff singing the song \\"All Hail the Power of Jesus' Name\\". Manila. Today FEBC remains on the air serving every country in Asia in more than 150 languages. Mr. Broger stepped down from his position at the FEBC to run the U.S. Military's indoctrination program. In 1954 Broger was recruited by Admiral Arthur W. Radford to develop an ideological framework for the U.S. Military. Militant Liberty: A Program of Evaluation and Assessment of Freedom was designed to provide a Free World ideological framework to combat Communism. In 1956 Mr. Broger became Deputy Director of the Directorate for Armed Forces Information and Education (Armed Forces Information Service), Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower) - and later Director of that office which he held until 1984. During his tenure Broger conducted many other psychological operations aimed at countering the effects of communist ideology.

The mix of Latin music, house music and dancehall started in NYC in the late 80's. Merenhouse usually combines a rap style of singing (talk-singing) with actual singing. It has instruments that are typically in merengue music, such as saxophones, trumpets, accordion, bass, guitar, güira, tambora (drum). However, they can be combined with electronic sounds or even electronic sounds sampled from the actual instruments (musch like house music). Sampling music means to take a sample or portion of a sound recording to reuse it in a song. Merenhouse is very upbeat for dancing, like house music. It is hard to identify merenhouse based on its time signature and rhythm alone. Some merenhouse music is in a fast 2/4 beat and has typical merengue style rhythms. Some also is in a slower 4/4 beat, identifying more with the hip hop style. Merenhouse can be characterized mostly by the instruments/electronics used and the combination of vocal styles. History Dominican merengue music can be considered an expression of Dominican transnationalism, as there was a significant shift in migration of Dominicans to New York City in the twentieth century. As a musical hybrid, merenhouse was popular with a generation of bicultural youth growing up in New York City with Dominican roots that combined both aspects of their culture. Merenhouse is a symbol of national identity to Dominican Americans. The early 1990s saw a huge increase in immigration to the US from the Dominican Republic due largely to the greatly deteriorating economic situation of the Dominican Republic in the 1980s and early 1990s. New York City saw the bulk of this initial Dominican population growth, and once those first Dominican immigrates got settled in, New York City became the hub of Dominican culture in the US. “By 1990, an estimated 900,000 Dominicans - 12 percent of the country’s population - lived in New York City alone.” Dominicans also “tend to be more concentrated residing exclusively in barrios or ghettos like Washington Heights-Inwood, home to 59% of Dominicans registered by the INS.” This potent concentration of Dominicans all in one place allowed them to bring in their own culture while they assimilated into the melting pot of cultures found in New York City. Merengue is one example of the many pieces of Dominican culture brought during this period of immigration, which was a key element to the creation of Merenhouse.Austerlitz, Paul.

Web. 25 Apr. 2011. http://journals.dartmouth.edu/cgi- bin/WebObjects/Journals.woa/2/xmlpage/2/article/104>. The new style was most importantly influenced by Merengue, the national music and dance of the Dominican Republic. It is in a fast 2/4 beat that has African, Creole, and European origins that emerged during the early 20th Century. Merengue music has varying styles and a very distinct rhythm.https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr;=&id;=WKISO Ful6gC&oi;=fnd&pg;=PR7&dq;=Dominican+merengue+music&ots;=RkvPuRNQWs&sig;=8Scu6nBYT8Y9o4EcUxcYwhsIaMY#v=onepage&q;&f;=false During its beginnings it included call-and-response vocals, a Spanish guitar, and a box lamellophone called the Congolese marimbula. These instruments were replaced with the acoustic guitar, bass, German accordion, the tambora (a West African two headed drum), and a güira, which is a metal scraper. In the 1930s, Merengue became modernized and became the national symbol of the Dominican Republic. Orchestras played for the middle class and social elite dancehall. The sound became that of a more generic Latin band. This included instrument replacement for the piano, staple percussion and bass. The merengue in which merenhouse is based upon developed in the 1980s and 1990s, and resulted from Juan Luis Guerra’s incorporation of more modern sounding arrangements and socially relevant themes. He was also influenced by pop and jazz music.Itzigsohn, Jose , Cabral, Carlos Dore , Medina, Esther Hernandez andVazquez, Obed(1999) 'Mapping Dominican transnationalism: narrow and broad transnational practices', Ethnic and Racial Studies, 22: 2, 316 — 339 Music Influences Genres that were popular during the 1990s in New York City greatly influenced Dominican Americans to create Merenhouse/Merenrap: Reggae Reggae known as “the heartbeat of Jamaica.” Instruments include the snare, bass drums, keyboards, and guitars. When many think of reggae, they first think of the Rastafarian religion, which was created during the 1930s. Many associate Rastas and reggae because of Bob Marley, the Jamaican Icon.http://www.worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com Rap/Hip-Hop The beginnings of hip hop music/rap can be traced back to the Bronx, NY in the 1960s and 1970s where wall graffiti started to gain popularity with the prevalence of street gangs. The musical style rap was the result of multiple influences including the Jamaican style of music called “toasting” and several different styles of Deejaying. DJ styles such as scratching (invented by a DJ named Theodor) and “punch phasing.” rap can be defined as a style of music where the lyrics are half spoken, half sung in short phrases accompanied by a musical beat in the background. The term “hip hop” encompasses all of these elements, including rap, DJing, MCing, break dancing and graffiti.http://people.artcenter.edu/~acheng1/design_workshop/01.28.03/rap_evolution.pdf House music House music is considered a type of electronic dance music which was spawned in Chicago, IL, and it is heavily influenced by disco. The synthesizer is most commonly associated with electronic dance music and the music is often characterized by its continuous and repetitive beat. This subgenre of electronic dance music was influenced heavily by DJ Knuckles, who moved from playing others' records to making his own music. There are many subgenres of House music, including “acid house,” “Latin house,” “jungle,” and “techno,” as well as many more. This music also has close ties to hip hop.http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&context;=commstud_pubs&sei- redir;=1#search=\\"house+music\\" Influential Artists Fulanito is a Merenhouse group from the Dominican Republic.

She is an investigative reporter and news anchor who has covered stories around the world - both for ABC News as a correspondent and various major-market television stations. She was previously the host of The Stream on Al Jazeera America based in Washington DC. She is currently with WJLA-TV in Washington, which is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group.  Education and early career  Fletcher received a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Oregon in 1990. She majored in Journalism with a minor in English. In 1990, Fletcher began her on-air career while still in college with KEZI-TV in Eugene, Oregon. After graduating, she accepted a job anchoring daily newscasts for KTVZ-TV in Bend, Oregon. In 1993, she returned to Eugene and KEZI where she was the main anchor and investigative reporter. She covered natural disasters, including some of the Northwest's most devastating floods and forest fires. She also anchored coverage of one of the nation's worst high school shootings, the May 1998 tragedy at Thurston High School in Springfield, Oregon, adjacent to Eugene. The coverage she anchored of the Thurston High shootings was honored with an Edward R. Murrow Award for broadcast excellence.  TV career  Susan D'Astoli, Joe Hengemuehler, Lisa Fletcher, Jonathan Elias and Vivek Narayan at the 67th Annual Peabody Awards for the story Security Risks at Sky Harbor In 2002, after winning an Edward R. Murrow Award for an investigative series that exposed corrupt practices among Portland immigration officials, Fletcher accepted the job as the lead investigative reporter and news anchor for KNXV- TV in Phoenix, Arizona. She also co-hosted a Sunday morning political talk show with veteran news man Cary Pfeffer. Her undercover reports closed down corrupt multimillion-dollar businesses, put child predators behind bars and forced state agencies to account for millions of dollars of taxpayer money. Undercover, she also exposed serious security breaches at one of the nation's largest airports. As a result, the TSA immediately suspended, and later replaced, its Federal Security Director. The TSA took over all security checkpoints around the clock and launched a national inquiry into every airport's security procedures. Fletcher's stories also exposed lead in poker chips that are used in the world's most popular casinos. This story prompted international attention and a government investigation. Fletcher won the prestigious Nancy Dickerson Whitehead Medallion and a $10,000 award for her stories that exposed children abusing over-the-counter medications, resulting in their tragic deaths. Fletcher and her producer donated their $10,000 in prize money to a Phoenix area agency whose mission is to help kids stay off drugs. In 2007, she began working as an ABC News correspondent in Los Angeles. Then ABC News President David Westin said Fletcher had \\"a distinguished resume of hard-hitting investigative reports that have led to reforms in government and business. She's an incisive reporter and a skilled storyteller...\\" . ABC News consistently featured Fletcher on Good Morning America, ABC World News and Nightline. While reporting for ABC News, Fletcher was assigned to stories including the in-depth examination of Sarah Palin's record and standing during the 2008 presidential campaign,ABC News: Nightline. September 8, 2008. the Governor Mark Sanford political scandal in Argentina, the Craigslist Killer in Boston, the OJ Simpson trial and sentencing in Las Vegas and exclusive, daily coverage of the Michael Jackson death investigation. Fletcher was the first to secure an interview with the high-profile Scientology defector Jenna Miscavige Hill, as part of a full half-hour investigation for Nightline and exposed abuses at the nation's largest chimpanzee experimentation facility – prompting a federal investigation. Fletcher has won many honors for her work including the prestigious George Foster Peabody Award, multiple Edward R. Murrow Award and numerous Emmy Awards for investigative journalism. She's been featured in magazines, newspapers and a PBS documentary on her work as an investigative journalist. On April 12, 2016, she was hired by WJLA as senior investigative reporter and to contributing to Full Measure.

The banded blenny is a marine organism, meaning it lives in an aquatic environment. This species lives in the vicinity of coral reefs preferring sea grass beds in shallow waters down to . Although they are typically located in shallow waters, their colors camouflage them exceptionally well, leading to them rarely being seen or recognized. They have also been found within floating algae. They are part of the family perciform teleost fishes within the sub order Blenniodei. The suborder blenniodei currently comprises 6 families, 151 genera, and 883 species.[Patzner, Robert A. {a}; Hastings, Philip A; Springer, Victor G; Wirtz, Peter; Goncalves, Emanuel J.In Patzner, Robert A.; Goncalves, Emanuel J.; Hastings, Philip A.; Kapoor, B.G.

Chapter pagination: 443-473, Patzner, Robert A. {a}; Hastings, Philip A; Springer, Victor G; Wirtz, Peter; Goncalves, Emanuel J, 443-473. 2009.] The perciform fish lineage is distinguished by its small body size, as well as their coastal and benthic habitats. The banded blenny has a typical lifespan of one year. Taxonomic Characteristics Paraclinus fasciatus is a species within the class Osteichthyes, or bony fishes. This class represents the largest class of vertebrates, with more than 31,000 species. One of the distinguishing characteristics of this class is that the organisms have a skeleton at least partially made of bone. Another characteristic being, this class typically has cycloid or ctenoid scales in comparison to pointed placoid scales. These scales are distinguished by their bony makeup and the protective layer of mucous covering them. Castro, Peter (Ph.D.), Huber, Michael (Ph.D.), Rotjan, Randi (Professor) (2019) Marine Biology: Biology 260, Boston University, USA: McGraw-Hill Education (Mcgraw-create)] The operculum is another defining characteristic of this class, it is a gill cover which, as its name implies, protects the gills with a flap. Bony fishes typically have fin rays rather than a fleshy makeup that you see in cartilaginous fishes. Often, you will also see a swim bladder within bony fishes which acts as a floatation tool, allowing the fish to adjust its depth in the water. Morphology Banded blennies are small and slender. Their standard length is 15 mm.[Pazmandi, C. (2000) Blenniid phylogeny and the evolution of the fin hook characters (Order No. 9973753). Available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global. (304646100)]. The color of their body ranges from different shades of brown and has thick black bar-like stripes. They have three well defined dorsal-fin spines. Lin, H., & Hastings, P. (2011). \\"{Evolution of a Neotropical marine fish lineage (Subfamily Chaenopsinae, Suborder Blennioidei) based on phylogenetic analysis of combined molecular and morphological data\\". Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, 60(2), 236-248. Link text] They have fin-hook characteristics which are significant of the adaptations these blennies have made to their bottom-dwelling lifestyle. Adaptations of this pectoral fin has drawn great attention to the blennies from researchers. The lower part of the pectoral fin has a fibrous cord as well as deeply incised fin-web between neighboring rays. Banded blennies are also referred to as \\"combtooth blennies\\" because they have ctenoid scales. These are overlapping fish scales. Ctenoid scales are similar to cycloid scales which are large and thin with a circular shape. The main difference here is that ctenoid scales have spines or comb- like spikes at their free edges. Reproduction Blenniids are typically sexually dimorphic. The males are larger than the females and exhibit secondary sex characteristics (SSC). The SSC are especially seen during breeding seasons, which is typically early summer resulting in a large increase in population in late Summer/early Fall. The male SSC include, an enlarged dorsal fin, glands on the anal spine, and color marks on the head or body. Banded blennys are oviparous, meaning they release eggs as means of reproduction. There are breeding patterns observed among Blenniids, this includes males defending the breeding territory in which females come to spawn in a small hole or cavity. The territory is typically a sheltered area. The males provide the exclusive parental care and guard the eggs until they have hatched. Habitat The banded blennies tend to be found in tropical/subtropical locations. Within these locations, they are found in shallow waters, in coral, rock, and sandy bottoms. These blennies also seem to favor sea grass beds. Gibson, R 2010 \\"The Biology of Blennies\\" ‐ Edited by R. A. Patzner, E. J. Gonçalves, P. A. Hastings and B. G. Kapoor. Journal of Fish Biology, 76(7), 1871–1872 They are classified as benthic, coastal fishes, although some have been found at depths of 30m. . There have also been studies conducted that correlate the population density of banded blennies to the amount of unattached red algae, also known as drift algae. The study conducted by Stoner shows that the more drift algae there is, the more blennies there also are. This floating red algae is able to provide shelter, as well as food for the fish. These fish are also known to be exceptionally tolerant of physical and chemical conditions within the shallow waters along coastal Florida. Feeding Banded blennies are carnivores with highly specialized diets. Meaning, they feed on very specific species. They have teeth in their jaws to help capture prey as do most bony-fishes. Blennies tend to solely prey on amphipods when they are juveniles or below 15 mm in size. If they are above 15 mm in size their diet expands to not only amphipods, but also shrimp, crab, and isopods. Although this species has a highly specialized diet, it also seems to vary with seasonal changes, leading to differences in prey species abundance. A study conducted in Apalachee Bay, Florida, found that the most important prey species were Cymadusa compta and Hippolyte zostericola.

It is a benthic fish so it cruises along above the sandy or rocky seabed and foraging for crustaceans.  Habitat  The horned blenny can be commonly found in shallow waters, between 0 to 3 meters, inhabiting sponges, corals, and sea anemones. Its habitat choice relies on the abundance of food and shelter from predators, that is why it can be observed occupying seabed clams, oysters, shells, and submerged vegetation like mangroves and seagrass.  Geographic Distribution  The Paraclinus grandicomis inhabits tropical waters that range from Southern Florida through the Lesser Antilles. This species dwells in tropical (10-23N) and subtropical (23-35N) climate zones.  Physical Description  The horned blenny is a brown colored fish covered in pale mottling all over its body and head, Dorsal, anal, and tail fins have dark brown bases, and pale or clear edges. This species is characterized by having elongated snouts that are blunt at the end and a singular large horn called the maxillary bone branching from their heads, additionally thin strands of cirrus cover the nostrils and line its stalk from eyes to dorsal fin. The blenny’s spine is composed of 34-35 small vertebrae, giving it a maximum length of only 4 centimeters.  Ecology  The horned blenny, as well as some other Caribbean reef fishes, have developed behavioral and physiological adaptations that make them immune to stings of sea anemones. The acclimation process can take several minutes to several hours of being stung repeatedly by an anemone tentacle to build resistance.  Feeding  Horned blennies are carnivorous fish that do not only feast on seabed worms but also benthic crustacea; both of these food sources can be found in large quantities at the sea floor of shallow waters where most blennies live.  Sexual Dimorphism  Illustration of P. grandicomis sexual dimorphism. Typically the length of the protruding maxillary bone of blennies is longer in males than in females of the same species, however, proportional differences are maintained among species. the horned blenny, both male and female have their horns located on the anterior half of the skull orbit.

In graph theory, betweenness centrality is a measure of centrality in a graph based on shortest paths. For every pair of vertices in a connected graph, there exists at least one shortest path between the vertices such that either the number of edges that the path passes through (for unweighted graphs) or the sum of the weights of the edges (for weighted graphs) is minimized. The betweenness centrality for each vertex is the number of these shortest paths that pass through the vertex. Betweenness centrality was devised as a general measure of centrality: it applies to a wide range of problems in network theory, including problems related to social networks, biology, transport and scientific cooperation. Although earlier authors have intuitively described centrality as based on betweenness, gave the first formal definition of betweenness centrality. Betweenness centrality finds wide application in network theory; it represents the degree to which nodes stand between each other. For example, in a telecommunications network, a node with higher betweenness centrality would have more control over the network, because more information will pass through that node.  Definition  The betweenness centrality of a node v is given by the expression: :g(v)= \\\\sum_{s eq v eq t}\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{st}(v)}{\\\\sigma_{st}} where \\\\sigma_{st} is the total number of shortest paths from node s to node t and \\\\sigma_{st}(v) is the number of those paths that pass through v. Note that the betweenness centrality of a node scales with the number of pairs of nodes as suggested by the summation indices. Therefore, the calculation may be rescaled by dividing through by the number of pairs of nodes not including v, so that g \\\\in [0,1]. The division is done by (N-1)(N-2) for directed graphs and (N-1)(N-2)/2 for undirected graphs, where N is the number of nodes in the giant component. Note that this scales for the highest possible value, where one node is crossed by every single shortest path. This is often not the case, and a normalization can be performed without a loss of precision :\\\\mbox{normal}(g(v)) = \\\\frac{g(v) - \\\\min(g)}{\\\\max(g) - \\\\min(g)} which results in: :\\\\max(normal) = 1 :\\\\min(normal) = 0 Note that this will always be a scaling from a smaller range into a larger range, so no precision is lost.  Weighted networks  In a weighted network the links connecting the nodes are no longer treated as binary interactions, but are weighted in proportion to their capacity, influence, frequency, etc., which adds another dimension of heterogeneity within the network beyond the topological effects. A node's strength in a weighted network is given by the sum of the weights of its adjacent edges. :s_{i} = \\\\sum_{j=1}^{N} a_{ij}w_{ij} With a_{ij} and w_{ij} being adjacency and weight matrices between nodes i and j, respectively. Analogous to the power law distribution of degree found in scale free networks, the strength of a given node follows a power law distribution as well. :s(k) \\\\approx k^\\\\beta A study of the average value s(b) of the strength for vertices with betweenness b shows that the functional behavior can be approximated by a scaling form A. Barrat, M. Barthelemy, R. Pastor-Satorras, and A. Vespignani. The architecture of complex weighted networks. PNAS (2004) vol. 101 no. 11 :s(b)\\\\approx b^{\\\\alpha} : : : Percolation centrality Percolation centrality is a version of weighted betweenness centrality, but it considers the 'state' of the source and target nodes of each shortest path in calculating this weight. Percolation of a ‘contagion’ occurs in complex networks in a number of scenarios. For example, viral or bacterial infection can spread over social networks of people, known as contact networks. The spread of disease can also be considered at a higher level of abstraction, by contemplating a network of towns or population centres, connected by road, rail or air links. Computer viruses can spread over computer networks. Rumours or news about business offers and deals can also spread via social networks of people. In all of these scenarios, a ‘contagion’ spreads over the links of a complex network, altering the ‘states’ of the nodes as it spreads, either recoverably or otherwise. For example, in an epidemiological scenario, individuals go from ‘susceptible’ to ‘infected’ state as the infection spreads. The states the individual nodes can take in the above examples could be binary (such as received/not received a piece of news), discrete (susceptible/infected/recovered), or even continuous (such as the proportion of infected people in a town), as the contagion spreads. The common feature in all these scenarios is that the spread of contagion results in the change of node states in networks. Percolation centrality (PC) was proposed with this in mind, which specifically measures the importance of nodes in terms of aiding the percolation through the network. This measure was proposed by Piraveenan et al. Percolation centrality is defined for a given node, at a given time, as the proportion of ‘percolated paths’ that go through that node. A ‘percolated path’ is a shortest path between a pair of nodes, where the source node is percolated (e.g., infected). The target node can be percolated or non- percolated, or in a partially percolated state. :PC^t(v)= \\\\frac{1}{N-2}\\\\sum_{s eq v eq r}\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{sr}(v)}{\\\\sigma_{sr}}\\\\frac{{x^t}_s}{{\\\\sum {[{x^t}_i}]}-{x^t}_v} where \\\\sigma_{sr} is total number of shortest paths from node s to node r and \\\\sigma_{sr}(v) is the number of those paths that pass through v. The percolation state of the node i at time t is denoted by {x^t}_i and two special cases are when {x^t}_i=0 which indicates a non-percolated state at time t whereas when {x^t}_i=1 which indicates a fully percolated state at time t. The values in between indicate partially percolated states ( e.g., in a network of townships, this would be the percentage of people infected in that town). The attached weights to the percolation paths depend on the percolation levels assigned to the source nodes, based on the premise that the higher the percolation level of a source node is, the more important are the paths that originate from that node. Nodes which lie on shortest paths originating from highly percolated nodes are therefore potentially more important to the percolation. The definition of PC may also be extended to include target node weights as well. Percolation centrality calculations run in O(NM) time with an efficient implementation adopted from Brandes' fast algorithm and if the calculation needs to consider target nodes weights, the worst case time is O(N^3).  Algorithms  Calculating the betweenness and closeness centralities of all the vertices in a graph involves calculating the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices on a graph, which takes ^3) time with the Floyd–Warshall algorithm, modified to not only find one but count all shortest paths between two nodes. On a sparse graph, Johnson's algorithm or Brandes' algorithm may be more efficient, both taking ) time. On unweighted graphs, calculating betweenness centrality takes ) time using Brandes' algorithm. In calculating betweenness and closeness centralities of all vertices in a graph, it is assumed that graphs are undirected and connected with the allowance of loops and multiple edges. When specifically dealing with network graphs, often graphs are without loops or multiple edges to maintain simple relationships (where edges represent connections between two people or vertices). In this case, using Brandes' algorithm will divide final centrality scores by 2 to account for each shortest path being counted twice. Another algorithm generalizes the Freeman's betweenness computed on geodesics and Newman's betweenness computed on all paths, by introducing a hyper-parameter controlling the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. The time complexity is the number of edges times the number of nodes in the graph. The concept of centrality was extended to a group level as well.Puzis, R., Yagil, D., Elovici, Y., Braha, D. (2009)Collaborative attack on Internet users’ anonymity , Internet Research 19(1) Group betweenness centrality shows the proportion of geodesics connecting pairs of non-group members that pass through a group of nodes. Brandes' algorithm for computing the betweenness centrality of all vertices was modified to compute the group betweenness centrality of one group of nodes with the same asymptotic running time.  Related concepts  Betweenness centrality is related to a network's connectivity, in so much as high betweenness vertices have the potential to disconnect graphs if removed (see cut set) .

Once a large working farm and estate, it is now unincorporated park land and contains a number of ruins . History=Reusens Farm era The land was originally owned by Nicholas Cruger, and later by a group of individuals including R.A. Wilkinson, Catherine and Gilbert R. Fox, Henry DeGraaf, Warren Leslie, and several others. By the 1880s it had been acquired piece by piece by Guillaume A. Reusens, a businessman of Belgian ancestry who bred racehorses. According to a 1912 testimony in Westchester County Supreme Court in the case of N.Y Central & Hudson River Railroad vs. Guillaume A. Reusens (and others), Reusens and his surveyor detailed a sizable number of structures on the property including: * A large uninhabited old colonial house * A two-story and attic frame \\"Fox House\\" * A two-story and attic frame \\"Powers House\\" north of Hillside Avenue * A one-story and attic stable with coachman's house attached * A one-story frame building behind the cow stable * A racetrack with judge's stand * A brick reservoir north of the track * A stable north of Hillside Avenue * An ice house * Small sundry buildings Long View era Following the death of Guillaume Reusens on January 5, 1915, the property was inherited by his nephews, brothers Stanislaus P.M. C. and Eugene DeRidder. Starting in 1902, Stansilaus was the Belgian consul and resided in Louisville, Kentucky. Eugene died shortly thereafter in 1916. His death resulted in a dispute in which his common-law wife, a Mrs. Eloise Walter of The Hague, claimed to have a will giving her three-fourths of the estate. Eventually Stansilaus secured sole ownership of the property, which by that time was known as Long View. After the death of Stanislaus DeRidder on March 7, 1934, his widow Anne married Martin McAndrews. The couple maintained the property as a working farm. Anne McAndrews died on September 20, 1948. Martin McAndrews moved away sometime thereafter, and the property fell into serious disrepair. Actually the property was vandalized and burned. Martin was in Vietnam. There is no hiking allowed. Addendum from P McAndrew Heir. By 1965 Westchester County moved to condemn the property, which it did four years later in 1969. Not long after, under the County's Orders, the deteriorating structures on the property were demolished. The property and many of the buildings on it were filmed shortly before and after the demolition by local resident Frederic Cole. The footage was compiled into a short film called \\"The End of Long View\\". Research and restoration In April 2011 a Facebook group called \\"Historic McAndrews Estate\\" \\"Historic McAndrews Estate\\", Facebook was formed to research and explore the possibility restoring or cleaning up the property.

History The lighthouse at the Great Exhibition in 1888 The lighthouse at the Great Exhibition in 1888 Built in 1883, the Lime Tower was originally part of a new main entrance for J.C. Jacobsen's Carlsberg Brewery site in Valby. The brewery had assumed the name Gammel Carlsberg (en: Old Carlsberg) after his son, Carl Jacobsen, due to a controversy between them, had established a new brewery which, with his father's consent, traded under the name Ny Carlsberg (en: New Carlsberg). The new main entrance was an arch, which incorporated the new name in gilded letters. The gate was connected to the Lime Tower by a wall which was also built in limestone. Electric lighting had been introduced in the brewery in 1882, at a time when it was still not widely available in Copenhagen. Since the site was also located on high ground, atop Valby Hill, it was decided to combine the guardhouse with a lighthouse. Architecture The lighthouse is built to a Historicist design, drawing on Medieval castle towers for inspiration. It is built in limestone from Stevns and stands on a granite plinth. The gate consists of two granite pillars which are connected by a cast iron arch featuring Gammel Carlsberg's name in gilded letters. The arch is topped by a 12-pointed star, a symbol which J. C. Jacobsen used as a trademark and had recently registered as such in the newly established trademark register. A series of dates, representing key events in the history of the brewery are inscribed on the pillars: 1847 for the first brew, 1867 for the year the brewery burned, 1870 for the building of the so-called Annex Brewery, and 1883 for the building of the Gate.

Created by Turkish artist Mehmet Aksoy, the tall monument stood atop Kazıktepe, across from the ancient Castle of Kars. Visible from neighboring Armenia, the statue depicted two halves of a man, each reaching to hold the other’s hand. The monument was demolished in April 2011, only months after being criticized by then–prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as a \\"freak\\" or \\"monstrosity\\". Background The statue was commissioned by the Kars municipality as a gesture of reconciliation in Armenia–Turkey relations following the Zurich Protocols, a 2009 accord to establish formal diplomatic recognition between the two countries. Then–mayor of Kars, , referred to the statue as \\"his dream,\\" that would help bring together the \\"brothers and sisters\\" of the two nations. Demolition Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan described the monument as a \\"freak\\" or a \\"monstrosity\\" () during a visit to Kars on 8 January 2011. In spite of protests, the city authority decided to remove the statue. On 26 April 2011, demolition works in form of dismounting the sculpture's two heads, which Armenian sources considered effectively a decapitation.

Technology of Uranium, 1st Ed.; Israel Program for Scientific Translations: Jerusalem, 1966. Use in uranium extraction=Extraction DEHPA is used in the solvent extraction of uranium salts from solutions containing the sulfate, chloride, or perchlorate anions. This extraction is known as the “Dapex procedure.” Reminiscent of the behaviors of carboxylic acids, DEHPA generally exists as a hydrogen-bonded dimer in the non-polar organic solvents. For practical applications, the solvent, often called a diluent, is typically kerosene. A complex is formed from two equivalents of the conjugate base of DEHPA and one uranyl ion.Lemire, A.E.; Janzen, A.F.; Marat, K. A 31P and 15N Study of the Extraction of Uranyl Nitrate by Di-2-ethylhexyl Phosphoric Acid. Inorg. Chim. Acta, 1985, 110, 234-241. Complexes of the formula (UO2)2[(O2P(OR)2]4 also form, and at high concentrations of uranium, polymeric complexes may form. The extractability of Fe3+ is similar to that of uranium, so it must be reduced to Fe2+ before the extraction.Wilkinson, W.D. Uranium Metallurgy, 1st Ed.; Interscience Publishers: New York, 1962; Vol. 1. Stripping The uranium is then stripped from the DEHPA/kerosene solution with hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid, or carbonate solutions. Sodium carbonate solutions effectively strip uranium from the organic layer, but the sodium salt of DEHPA is somewhat soluble in water, which can lead to loss of the extractant. Synergistic effects The extractive capabilities of DEHPA can be increased through synergistic effects by the addition of other organophosphorus compounds. Tributyl phosphate is often used, as well as dibutyl-, diamyl-, and dihexylphosphonates. The synergistic effects are thought to occur by the addition of the trialkylphosphate to the uranyl-DEHPA complex by hydrogen bonding. The synergistic additive may also react with the DEHPA, competing with the uranyl extraction, resulting in a decrease in extraction efficiency past a concentration specific to the compound. Merritt, R.C. The Extractive Metallurgy of Uranium, 1st Ed.; Colorado School of Mines Research Institution, 1971. Alternatives to DEHPA Secondary, tertiary, and quaternary amines have also been used for some uranium extractions as an alternative to DEHPA. Compared to phosphate extractants, amines are more selective for uranium, extract the uranium faster, and are easily stripped with a wider variety of reagents. However, the phosphates are more tolerant of solids in the feed solution and show faster phase separation.

Double dump valves are primarily used to discharge chunky or fibrous, bulk materials from hoppers, bins, and cyclones operating under positive or negative pressure. Double dump valves are used to discharge a flow of material while at the same time serving as an airlock transition point to preserve the pressure differential above and below the valve. This type of material handling valve is ideal for use with bulky or abrasive materials that would tend to jam or damage a rotary feeder. Operation Double dump valves have two trap-door flap plates which open and close on an alternating cycle. The top gate opens to allow collected material to drop through onto the bottom gate. The top gate then re-closes to prevent air leakage above the valve. The bottom gate then opens to allow material to pass completely through the valve. The bottom gate then re-closes to prevent air leakage below the valve. This cycle is continuously repeated in order to maintain a steady discharge of material from the valve, while maintaining a positive seal on the system. Design Timing of the flap plates is critical in order to make sure a double dump valve operates properly. There are several designs that have been employed in order to maintain a consistently operating valve. Control systems=Pneumatic Each flap plate has its own pneumatically operated cylinder and solenoid valve. The timing of the valve is controlled by an electronic signal sent to the solenoid valves. This method of operation is the most expensive and allows for accurate timing of the valve. Counterbalance This type of double dump valve works essentially, like a stacked pair of trickle valves. Each flap plate is held closed with a counterweighted arm. As material builds up on the top plate the weight of the head of material pushes it open where it dumps onto the bottom plate. This type of double dump valve has no electrical or pneumatic controls and is the least expensive method of operation. However, it is difficult to sustain a properly timed cycle. Cam-operated A motor-driven cam rotates and alternately opens the top gate and the bottom plate. A spring attached to the gate’s shaft re-closes the gates. This type of double dump valve is generally the most reliable and can be operated with an electric motor or a pneumatic motor. The speed of the cycle can be selected through the gear reducer ratio or by adjusting the motor speed.

It was getting more and more difficult because the results were not given because no matter how much the others won, they gave no advantages; Until you can not keep the category down with the team (one of the ugliest things obtained in football). The last game of Centurión in the Deportivo Coatepeque was against Communications FC in condition of visitor with a marker against of 4 to 0.

Homepage, University of Arizona, 2002, accessed 24 March 2011 Holliday's research interests include geoarchaeology, Paleoindian archaeology, soil- geomorphology as well as Quaternary landscape evolution and paleoenvironment with a current emphasis on the Southwestern United States and Northwest Mexico. Prior research areas have included the Great Plains as well as Paleolithic sites in southwestern Russia. Holliday currently serves as the Executive Director of the Argonaut Archaeological Research Fund (AARF) based in the School of Anthropology at the University of Arizona.Holliday, Vance T, Argonaut Archaeological Research Fund, University of Arizona, Dept. of Anthropology, January 2009, accessed March 24, 2011 His most recent research, outlined in a 2011 Journal of Field Archaeology article, has focused on understanding the Paleoindian occupation around large paleo-lakes in the Southern landscape at the end of the Pleistocene. Background After graduating from Winston Churchill High School in San Antonio, Texas Holliday began his undergraduate education at a local junior college where he studied architecture. During his sophomore year Holliday transferred to the University of Texas at Austin where he earned a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) with Honors in Anthropology (1972). Holliday went on to earn a Master of Art (M.A.)in Museum Science from Texas Tech University (1977). As an undergraduate Holliday's main interest was Texas archaeology. He performed extensive field experience as an employee of the Texas Archeological Salvage Project Holliday’s archaeological interests soon shifted to soils, landscapes and geoarchaeology. He obtained a Ph.D. in Geology from the University of Colorado at Boulder (1982). During his time at Texas Tech, Holliday worked closely with Dr. Eileen Johnson of the Museum of Texas Tech University on the Lubbock Lake Project located in Northwestern Texas.Johnson, Eileen; Holliday, Vance T. \\"A Plainview Kill/Butchering Locale on the Lllano Estacado-The Lubbock Lake Site.

One of the most notable findings at the Lubbock Site is the discovery of cultural features which span the Paleo-Indian period.\\"Significance of Site\\" Lubbock Lake Landmark. March 24, 2011. Holliday has written several journal articles on the Lubbock Site focusing on inventorying and describing Plainview complex material located at the kill/butchery locales detailing the dating of the Plainview occupation at the site;Holliday, Vance T.; Johnson, Eileen. \\"An Update on the Plainview Occupation at the Lubbock Lake Site.\\" Plains Anthropologist, 26: 251-253. 1981. as well as discussing multiple camping occasions and activities of the Paleo-Indians at the area.Johnson, EIleen; Holliday, Vance T. \\"Late Paleoindian Activity at the Lubbock Lake Site.\\" Plains Anthropologist, 26:173-193. 1981. In 1984, after completion of his Ph.D, Holliday accepted a position as visiting professor and assistant professor at Texas A&M; University. The theme of Holliday’s journal articles began to heavily focus on the soil and geologic make-up of the Lubbock Lake Site, based on his Ph.D. dissertation. Some of Holliday’s later journal articles included discussing the archaeological geologyHolliday, Vance T. \\"Archaeology Geology of the Lubbock Lake Site, Southern High Plains of Texas.\\" Geological Society of America Bulletin, 96: 1483-1492. 1985. and early Holocene soilsHolliday, Vance T. \\"Early Holocene Soils at the Lubbock Lake Archaeological Site, Texas.\\" Cantena, 12:61-78. 1985. at the site; as well as the stratigraphy found at LubbockHaas, Herbert; Holliday, Vance T.; Stuckenrath, Robert. \\"Dating of Holocene Stratigraphy with Soluble and Insoluble Organic Fractions at the Lubbock Lake Archaeological Site, Texas: An Ideal Case Study.\\" Radiocarbon, 28:473-485. 1986. In addition to these journal articles Holliday also focused some of his writings on the lithics found at the site.Johnson, Eileen; Holliday, Vance T. \\"Lubbock Lake Lithic Assemblages.\\" Lubbock Lake: Late Quaternary Studies on the Southern High Plains: 1-13. 1987. Holliday found Lubbock Lake valuable for from the many lasting records of plant and animal communities, geology, climate and human activities available at the site.Holliday, Vance T. Lubbock Lake Landmark. Museum of Texas Tech University. 2003. In 1986, Holliday joined the University of Wisconsin at Madison in the Geography department, where he remained until 2002. During this time, many of his journal articles focused on other sites and geo-archaeological and Quaternary geologic aspects of the southern Great Plains area. Holliday received several National Science Foundation grants to investigate aspects of the late Quaternary landscape evolution of the Southern High Plains. Holliday also pursued his interests in Paleoindian archaeology. This resulted in a series of papers on late Quaternary stratigraphy, paleoenvironments and Paleoindian geo-archaeology. This series of papers resulted in Holliday’s 1995 Geological Society of America book, Stratigraphy and Paleoenvironments of Late Quaternary Valley Fills, as well as his 1997 book titled Paleoindian Geoarchaeology of the Southern High Plains. Holliday also devoted some of time to the application of his ideas on using soils in geoarchaeological research, on which he wrote a book, Soils in Archaeological Research, which was published in 2004 after arriving at the University of Arizona. Since 2002 Holliday has been a professor in both the School of Anthropology and Department of Geosciences as well as an adjunct professor in the department of Geography at the University of Arizona at Tucson. In 2002 Holliday also accepted the position of Executive Director of the Argonaut Archaeological Research Fund (AARF), a long-term research program focused on the earliest peopling of the Southwest U.S. and northwestern Mexico. Since the establishment of AARF, Holliday has been involved in many site excavations in the southwest, more specifically in Mexico and New Mexico. The Mockingbird Gap site discovered in the 1950s southeast of Socorro, New Mexico is described as “one of the largest and perhaps least known Clovis sites in the southwestern United States.” Initial excavations revealed hundreds of Clovis artifacts such as projectile point bases, fluted point preforms and gravers from an area 800 meters by 80–150 meters. A 2004 visit led the Holliday and collaborator B.B. Huckell (University of New Mexico) to believe there was more to be learned from the site about Clovis occupation and in 2005 excavations began which continued throughout the 2006 and 2007 field seasons. Their initial beliefs were validated when results of these excavations show significant Clovis age deposits at the site. Research with B.B. Huckell was also carried out at several Folsom sites on the West Mesa area of the Albuquerque Basin. The work documented the spatial patterning of paleoenvironmental context of Folsom occupations around several small lake basins. :In Sonora, field work in collaboration with M.G.Sanchez (INAH) focused on a series of Clovis sites, most prominently an in-situ Clovis/Gomphothere kill site and an extensive camping area on the adjacent uplands. Holliday has conducted research and field work in many locations across the southwest United States, Argentina and in the Don River Valley of Russia. He has written and/or edited five books as well as authored or co-authored over 50 reviewed book and journal articles as well as another 200 articles and book chapters. Awards and honors Holliday has been the recipient of several notable professional awards including the 1998 Kirk Bryan Award of the Geological Society of America for Stratigraphy and Paleoenvironments of Late Quaternary Valley Fills on the Southern High Plains (1995); 1998 George R. “Rip” Rapp Archaeological Geology Career Award of the Geological Society of America.36 Holliday was also elected Fellow of the Geological Society of America in 1992 as well as being an invited organizer of the First Annual Fryxell Symposium on Earth Science in Archaeology for the American Society of Archaeology in 1988 and was an invited participant in a symposium honoring the 50th anniversary publication of Hans Jenny’s Factors of Soil Formation at the Soil Science Society of America annual meeting in 1991. Holliday has been the recipient of multiple grants from organizations such as the National Geographic Society, the National Science Foundation, the University of Wisconsin Graduate School, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Key excavations Holliday has led or participated in numerous projects over his professional career beginning with weekend digs around Austin, Texas with the University of Texas. After graduation in December 1972 Holliday’s part-time job with the Texas Archaeological Salvage Project became full-time. This was in the earliest days of CRM archaeology and Holliday spent his days making maps and other report illustrations eventually working his way up to a field archaeologist. During this time Holliday worked in East Texas, the Edwards Plateau of Central Texas, along the Texas coast as well as in the deserts of West Texas and in the High Plains. In 1973 Holliday began work as a volunteer on the Lubbock Lake site where he later began research in 1974. As Holliday began his Ph.D studies, he began focusing on geoarchaeology and Paleoindian archaeology on the Great Plains. The sites he worked on during this time included Clovis (Blackwater Draw), Plainview, Midland, Mustang Springs, Lipscomb, Miami, San Jon, Folsom, Lindenmeier, and Dent Site. During Holliday’s professional career he also worked on Holocene sites on the Argentine Pampas and Kostenki localities in Russia. Since 2002, Holliday’s research has shifted to the southwest U.S. and northwest Mexico. Holliday has been involved on projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Sonora (as part of AARF) and also a participant in fieldwork in Montana and Alaska. Research emphasis While Holliday’s academic background is in Archaeology, Geology and Soil Science, he spent 17 years of his professional career focusing on Geography. The combination of these intersecting interests and experiences has fostered a career devoted to reconstructing landscapes and environments where ancient human populations have lived. More specifically Holliday’s current research emphasis includes: 1. Using the geosciences to answer archaeological questions (geoarchaeology); 2. The early peopling of the Southwest and Great Plains, and the landscape evolution and environments of the late Quaternary in these regions; 3. The use of soils as indicators of the past.

Description Adult Starksia atlantica can grow to in length. It is an elongated shape with a continuous short dorsal fin running most of the length of the body. The colour is variable, being mostly mottled brown on a silvery background with larger dark spots above. The dorsal fin has 18–19 rays, the anal fin 7–8 rays, the pelvic fins have 15–16 and the pectorals 14 rays.Labrisomidae: Starksia Larvae of coral reef fishes. Retrieved 2011-12-29. Early stage larvae of Starksia are more tadpole-shaped than other labrisomids and lack some of the melanophores (dark spots) typical of the family. Juvenile Starksia atlantica are long and narrow, with large eyes. The mouth is at the tip of the pointed snout. Both the dorsal and anal fins run continuously for most of the length of the body. The pectoral fins are long and the pelvic fins have 2 spines and are long and threadlike. The melanophores are few in number and occur at the base of the anal fin rays.

These valves are typically a less expensive alternative to more commonly used rotary airlocks. Unlike rotary airlock valves which are driven by either an electric motor or a gas or air-powered motor, trickle valves require no external power source and are therefore well-suited for use in mechanical trenchers, where a dust-free environment in the pinnacle truss and axle bore is required for smooth operation. Trickle values were originally developed for this purpose. Operation Trickle valves can be used only on systems operating under negative pressure. The vacuum created inside the dust collector holds the valve closed, allowing a head of material to build up above the trickle valve. Once the pressure of the material equals the negative pressure of the system, the valve is forced open and a trickle of material will begin flowing from the valve at the same rate it is collected. The magnitude of the vacuum of the system and the bulk density of the material being handled determine how much material will build up before the valve begins to discharge. Because trickle valves work automatically and require no power source or controls, they have very low initial cost and virtually no operating cost. Design A well designed trickle valve has few or no moving parts. Most trickle valves are also adjustable as to how much vacuum pressure it takes to operate. Adjustments are typically made with a weighted counterbalance or an adjustable leaf spring. Because these valves have no way to force clogs through, they are only recommended for use with dry and relatively dense, free-flowing materials such as sand, fly ash, and cement. Types=Duckbill sleeve type This type of trickle valve utilizes a specially designed duckbill rubber sleeve. The negative pressure of the dust collection system collapses the sleeve on itself, creating an airtight seal. Adjustable leaf springs are inserted into the sides of the sleeve which help to resist the vacuum. The weight of collected material above the valve forces the sleeve open to allow a steady discharge. Duckbill sleeve trickle valves have no moving parts. Trap door type Trap door trickle valves have one moving part, a hinged flap plate to maintain a seal between the hopper and the discharge. This type of valve is adjusted with an external weighted counterbalance or it is not adjustable. Greased bearings are required for smooth operation of the flap plate’s hinge.

Early life Teoh Tiang Chye was born in February 1863. He was educated in Malacca Free School from 1875 - 1877 before taking apprenticeship in various Chinese shops in Singapore and Klang. In 1890, together with Dr W T B Falls, a British Surgeon, they set up Malacca Dispensary. Later on in 1911, he handed over the Malacca Dispensary to his second son.The Malacca Guardian, Jan. 23rd, 1928; p3 As the proprietor of \\"Malacca Dispensary\\"; he is well known to have stocked his shop with ample perfumes and drugs to meet demands. Prior to this, dispensaries in Malacca has a bad image of not meeting the communities needs. In September 1890, he was granted a license to conduct sales in Malacca under the \\"Bills of Sales Ordinance 1886\\" Thereon, he was active as an auctioneer. The duties were later carried on by his sons Teoh Hong Tye and Teoh Hong Tiat. He was also active as one of the Jurors in Malacca in 1904. Philanthropy Mr Teoh Tiang Chye has shared some of his wealth to benefit the welfare of the Malacca communities. A plaque in his nameSide view of the ShadeStill in good condition even though built in 1926 In March 1926, he presented Bukit Jelutong Chinese Cemetery, Malacca with a brick built shade - 54 feet long; 20 feet wide, with cement concrete flooring and tiled roofing - for public use, at the crematorium. Before this, family members have to wait under the sweltering heat of the sun, while waiting for the completion of a cremation. In December 1927 he reconstructed 3 miles of road and 10 culverts at the Bukit Jelutong cemetery for the convenience of the public. In July 1928, he contributed generously to build three isolation wards at the Quarantine Camp, Mata Kuching, - for contagious disease such as smallpox - Malacca.Pitchaimuthu, Lourdes. \\"Sejarah Perubatan dan Penubuhan Hospital-hospital di Melaka\\". Persatuan Sejarah Malaysia, 1997, p. 29 Tiang Chye personally supervised the building of the isolation ward which was built at the cost of Straits Dollar $10,000, complete with bathroom and beds. During the handover ceremony, among the distinguish guest that were present is the Resident Councillor - Hon. Mr C F Green and Hon. Tan Cheng Lock. Tiang Chye's words as picked up by the Malacca Guardian were \\"You were about to declare the wards open. Sir, when they are opened, I pray to God that no cases of small pox be admitted to them. They are there, however, if the necessity should arise.\\" The 3 isolation wards are substantially built brick buildings, with tiled roofs, measured 34 feet in length by 24 feet in breadth. Each ward had 2 rooms, each room measuring 12 feet square, comes with a kitchen, bathroom and lavatory for privacy and comfort. Each room is furnished with iron bedstead with wire mattress, a table, a bench and a lamp.The Malacca Guardian, July 30, 1928; p11 In mid-May 1930, he had contributed a sum of $2,000 Straits Dollar to a Portuguese Mission School at Banda Hilir. In appreciation, the School decided to name one of the class rooms after him. In April 1935 he had presented the Malacca Historical Society with the antique 1/2 picul rice measure, known to the Malay as saat. This unit of measurement was in use before the Weight and Measures Ordinance came into being. Recognition from the state In recognition for his contributions to the Malacca communities, Mr Teoh Tiang Chye was made a Justice of the Peace in Malacca, in January 1928, by HE the Governor of the British territory called the Straits Settlements. He was made a Member of the Visiting Committee for Malacca General Hospital when it was opened in 1934, however resigned after 3 terms, in 1937.National Library, Singapore , 21 October 1937, \\"Social and Personal\\" Page 10 accessed 27 April 2011 The Colonial Secretary had in January 1934, 1936, 1937 1938 appointed him as one of the member of the Board of Visiting Justices for the Settlement of Malacca. Active Community member Tiang Chye was a committee for the Cheng Hoon Teng Temple and President of the Malacca Chinese Lawn Tennis Club Contributions to the society Tiang Chye would volunteer his time to clear the shrubs and lallang at Bukit China, an act of charity so descendants of those who were buried there will be able to locate the respective grave of their ancestor. Sometime in early 1919, while cleaning, he discovered a forgotten grave belonging to a Japanese naval officer who died on 3 April 1861, on the training ship - Iskuba Kan - when it was in the Straits water, near Malacca. He told two Japanese ladies about it while they were searching for medicinal herbs near the place. When Tiang Chye was the Cheng Hoon Teng Temple member of committee he had voiced his resentment when the British government appointed a committee to enquire into Chinese Marriage as it is seen as interference and may rob the community of their preservation of rites and ceremonies. He was also strict in using the temple solely for religious purpose and not for commercial reasons, stopping a grievance of Malacca Hawkers' meeting from taking place in the temple. During the late 18th century, the British had encouraged the locals to grow the Hevea brasiliensis. However the price of rubber had dropped drastically in the early 1930s, being effects of the Great Depression; the rubber dealers and owners were badly affected. Tiang Chye, being one of the planters, had taken the lead on 26 August 1930 to address the issue and with a Petition to the Governor asking:- (i) Exemption from payment of rubber assessment until there is an improvement in the condition of the industry. (ii) Reduction of 3/4 of the quit rent payable on all rubber estates. (iii) Exemption from payment to the Malacca Agricultural Medical Board. As the result of the Petition, on 14 November 1930,National Library, Singapore \\"Relief for Planters\\" The Singapore Free Press & Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 15 November 1930, p.19 accessed on 15 May 2011 the Governor agreed to reduce the quit rent starting from New Year to $1 per acre (from $4 previously) and allows for rent installments where necessary. However, the Government is unable to grant exemption of payment of Rural Board assessment and medical cess. With regards to payment of rent on undeveloped land, government has yet to consider. Family In May 1911, unfortunately for Tiang Chye, his wife, Mdm Ong Soon Neo, 49, died at relatively young age due to illness.National Library Singapore The Straits Times, 8 May 1911, Page 6; \\"Social and Personal\\", accessed on 27 April 2011 Their sons were - Teoh Hong Tye @ Teoh Bong Leong and Teoh Hong Tiat.

His wife Mdm Loh Geok Choo, however succumbed to long illness at the age of 35. He remarries to Ms Chan Bong Cheng neo a couple of years later. Hong Tiat had 4 daughters and 3 sons. He is currently survived by his youngest son, Teoh Bock Kim (born 1931). When Hong Tiat died on 17 Sept 1938, his Probate (Regd 268/2603) was granted to his brother.

It is a colorless or white crystalline solid that is usually stored in the form of its sodium salt. In aqueous solution it is strongly acidic and is easily oxidized in air. Phenylsulfinic acid and its esters are chiral. Acidity There is a large range of pKa values in the literature, with most authors giving a value of around 1.30.a) A. T. Fuller, I. M. Tonkin and J. Walker, J. Chem. Soc., 1945, 636; b) S. Smiles and C. M. Bere, \\"Organic Syntheses,\\" Coll. Vol. I, ed. by A. H. Blatt, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 1948, p. 7; c) E. Bader and H. D. Hermann, Chem. Ber., 88, 46 (1955); d) M. Kulka, Can. J. Chem., 32, 601 (1954). This inconsistency can be explained by differences in ionic strength between quoted values. By measuring the pKa at various ionic strengths and extrapolating to zero ionic strength, the pKa of phenylsulfinic acid was determined to be 2.76. This makes phenylsulfinic acid a stronger acid than its corresponding carboxylic acid, benzoic acid (pKa = 4.2), but weaker than its corresponding sulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid (pKa = −6.5).E. P. Serjeant, B. Dempsey. \\"Ionization Constants of Organic Acids in Solution\\" IUPAC Data, Series No. 23 (Pergamon Press, Oxford) Preparation Phenylsulfinic acid can be prepared in several ways, most easily through reduction of sulfonyl chlorides with zinc dust or iron. However other starting materials can be used. Due to the air sensitivity of this compound it is often formed as a salt. :2 C6H5SO2Cl + 2 Zn → (C6H5SO2)2Zn + ZnCl2 :(C6H5SO2)2Zn + Na2CO3 \\\\+ NaOH → 2 C6H5SO2Na + ZnCO3 A convenient method is the reduction of the sulfonyl chloride or sulfonyl fluoride with sodium sulfite, producing the acid instead of a salt: :C6H5SO2Cl + Na2SO3 \\\\+ H2O → C6H5SO2H + NaCl + NaHSO4 Many other methods have been reported for production of sulfinic acids such as the use tin(II) chloride, or the Grignard reagent with sulfur dioxide. The preparation of sulfinic acids by the oxidation of thiols is difficult due to overoxidation. Properties In sulfinic acids, sulfur has the +4 oxidation state. They are prone to oxidation to sulphonic acids as well as reduction via sulphenic acids (+2) to thiols. Sulphinic acid derivatives disproportionate in the presence of acid: :2 PhSO2H → PhSO2SOPh + H2O :PhSO2SOPh → PhSO2• + PhSO → PhSO3SPh :PhSO3SPh + PhSO2H → PhSO3H + PhSO2SPh When phenylsulfinic acid reacts with sulfur to give thiosulfinates and thiosulfinic acids. Use The main use of phenylsulfinic acid is for the asymmetric synthesis of carbon- carbon bonds due to its ability to stabilize negative charges on an adjacent carbon atom. Phenylsulfinic acid has been a component for electroplating of palladium alloys.

General Tanginye led a southern border militia allied to the Khartoum government during Sudan's civil war. Members of the Sudanese armed forces loyal to Gen Tang in Malakal clashed with the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) in 2006, killing about 150 people, and in 2009 in breach of the peace deal. In April 2011, clashes between his militia and the SPLA in the state of Jonglei killed at least 57 according to government officials. Shortly thereafter, Tanginye surrendered to SPLA forces and was placed under house arrest in Juba awaiting charges against him.http://www.sudantribune.com/South-Sudan-Renegade- Gabriel,38774 During the South Sudanese Civil War, he allied with the SPLA-IO and later Lam Akol's militia, a Juba linked rebel group called the National Democratic Movement (NDM) and became its chief of staff. In January 2017 he visited a NDM-allied group, the Tiger Faction New Forces, in the Hamra area in the northern Upper Nile. In course of this visit, the Tigers were attacked by SPLM-IO-affiliated fighters belonging to the militia of John Uliny, and Tanginye was killed alongside most of the Tigers.  Sudanese Civil Wars  During the First Sudanese Civil War, Tanginye joined the Anyanya movement. Tanginye disliked the Addis Ababa Agreement that ended the civil war in 1972, so he joined the mainly Nuer Anyanya II. In 1984, he and other Anyanya II leaders allied with the Sudanese government in order to fight the mainly Dinka Sudan People's Liberation Army. While large numbers of the Anyanya II joined the SPLA around 1988, Tanginye and his forces stayed allied to the government. Tanginye and his forces joined the SPLA-Nasir faction after it split from the SPLA in 1991. Tanginye became a part of the South Sudan Defence Forces as part of the Khartoum Peace Agreement of 1997. After the defection of Lam Akol in October 2003, the Sudanese government feared losing the Upper Nile area. They provided Tanginye's forces with boats, trucks, guns, and ammunition, which Tanginye used in a campaign in the modern Western Nile State in 2004 designed to rid the area of SPLA support. The campaign killed hundreds and displaced tens of thousands of civilians through its use of burning and looting villages. Tanginye was made a major general of the Sudanese Armed Forces in 2004. Unlike many of the pro-Sudan militiamen who were integrated into the SPLA, Tanginye did not sign the Juba Declaration of 8 January 2006. However, Brig. John Both did integrate into the SPLA and took about 70 percent of Tanginye's force with him, leaving the remaining forces estimated at less than 500.  2005-2011  Location of Malakal before 2011 After the Comprehensive Peace Agreement ended the Second Sudanese Civil War in 2005, Tanginye's forces became part of the Joint Integrated Units. He mostly stayed in Khartoum, only occasionally visiting the South. In 2006, the SPLA offered Tanginye the post of Commissioner of Fangak, but tensions increased when Tanginye asked to keep his 'personal' SAF forces and SAF position. Clashes broke out between the SAF and SPLA components of the Joint Integrated Unit in Malakal, leaving about 150 dead in the Battle of Malakal. When Tanginye visited Malakal in 2009 to visit relatives, clashes also broke out between units of the SAF that were former members of Tanginye's militia and the SPLA, leaving about 60 dead. In September 2010, Tanginye was offered amnesty by Salva Kiir, and he visited Juba and Bentiu and met with Nuer members of the SPLM. He reportedly agreed to join the SPLA, but remained quiet the following months. Members of the SAF in Malakal Joint Integrated Unit who remained loyal to Tanginye became concerned about their uncertain future, with some opposing the idea of Tanginye joining the SPLA, and in early February 2011 clashes broke out among the SAF units in Malakal, which soon spread to other towns in the Upper Nile State including Paloich. These clashes about 50 dead. In mid-February 2011, Pagan Amum reported that Tanginye had returned to the South in January with 300 men driving trucks with mounted machine guns supplied by Khartoum. Pagan said that Tanginye was on the move to Fangak County to join George Athor's rebellion. In early April 2011, Tanginye assembled some of his men at Kaldok, Fangak County, supposedly for integration into the SPLA. On 20 April, an officer who refused to integrate his forces was killed. On 23-24 April, Tanginye's forces clashed with SPLA troops commanded by Brig. Gen. Gatwich Gai, leaving 7 SPLA and 57 of Tanginye’s men dead. On 25 April, Tanginye and 1,300 of his men surrendered to the SPLA. He was then placed under house arrest in Juba.  Independent South Sudan  Tanginye was still detained when South Sudan gained its independence on 9 July 2011. However, on 7 October 2013, president Salva Kiir pardoned Tanginye and other former militia commanders. On 29 November 2013, Tanginye was appointed a major general in the SPLA. After the start of the South Sudanese Civil War, Tanginye joined the SPLA-IO. Tanginye's Nuer fighters attacked Shilluk settlements in Panykang County during December 2013 and January 2014. Tanginye's fighters were stationed in New Fangak and primarily fought Johnson Olony's Agwelek Forces until they ended their alliance with the SPLA on 14 May 2015. Since then, Olony's forces acted in concert with Tanginye. On 23 June 2015, Tanginye and fellow SPLA-IO general Thomas Mabor Dhol took Malakal from the SPLA's 1st Division in an opportunistic attack with a force composed mainly of troops from Ulang and Fangak counties along with some of Olony's men. In June 2015, Tanginye signed a letter expressing frustration with Riek Machar, and in August 2015 he left the SPLA-IO and joined Gabriel Changson Chang's Federal Democratic Party/South Sudan Armed Forces. Lam Akol then brought Tanginye into his primarily Shilluk National Democratic Movement as its chief of staff, a desperate choice given Tanginye's brutal campaigns against the Shilluk. Tanginye was supposed to go to Fangak to raise troops for the NDM, but in January 2017 he visited a NDM-allied group, the Tiger Faction New Forces, in the Hamra area in the northern Upper Nile. In course of this visit, the Tigers were attacked by SPLM-IO-affiliated fighters belonging to the militia of John Uliny, and Tanginye was killed alongside most of the Tigers.

It can also be used in day to day life by specialists within the pharmaceutical and food industries in order to determine taxa origins and food quality. Specifically in regards to archaeology though, the identification of starch grains, through this context is done by comparison identification, in which several attributes of the grains are compared to other known samples in order to determine the type. This comparison technique, when done microscopically allows for the specific taxa identification of starch grains found on specific artifacts, such as ground stone tools, within soils, through dental calculus, or found in reference to ceramic vessels. Starch grain analysis can be helpful as a supplement to other forms of study to understanding tool use, agricultural activities, as well as other plant based subsistence strategies, and to reconstruct plant based diets throughout time. Starch Grain First, starch is stored as a source of energy and found in most autotrophic plants, meaning plants that are able to create their own food through photosynthesis. There are a few exceptions to this however, within the families Asteraceae, Campanulaceae, and some others in which starch is not used as a source of energy that is reserved. This presents one downfall to the studying of plant taxa through starch grain analysis. Moving on, the ability for long term storage of starch grains for an energy source utilized by plants, makes starch grains a valuable source of study within an archaeological context. Starch is stored in the amyloplasts, a specialized organelle found within plant cells, as starch grains. The starch grain is specifically important for study due to the fact that it is commonly found in most plants, its long-lasting nature, as well as the diverse forms and structures that they can take based on which taxa they belong to. Starch Grain Lab Techniques= Staining Solutions  Staining solutions are one way to make comparative analysis of starch granules more accessible, depending on what type of stain is specifically used. For example, as stated by Kovárník and Benes, Lugol's solution stains the grains a dark blue color, in order to distinguish the starch grain from other common structures that can appear similar in size and shape. In addition to this technique, the use of CongoRed dye marks the damage, making it easier to study, compare, and to anlayze differences in the damage of particular taxa. Specifically, the intensity of the red color depends on how damaged the grain is. Lastly, Trypan blue is another way to stain grain damage within starch grains, only staining the damaged grains, not the undamaged. Specifically, it can be important to incorporate the staining process into an analysis due to the fact that there are several other structures found naturally that have similar characteristics to starch when compared under a microscope.  Starch Extraction in the Context of Archaeological Tools  There are several ways to go about extracting the starch granules from stone tools. One technique as explained by Kovárnik and Benes described as the most common, is through pipetting the surface of the objects on the most common areas in which starch grains are found, for example fissures, or others divetts on the artifact. The water droplets from the pipetting technique are then collected onto slides to be utilized in comparative analysis. This is a common technique for the use of understanding specifically how stone tools were used, and what types of plants were being exploited during the time being studied. Another common approach is to dislodge the starch grains through sonication, which is a laboratory technique that uses sound waves to \\"agitate particles\\" in order to convert an electrical signal into a vibration which in turn breaks down a substance. In terms of starch grain analysis, the starch grains are released by use of an ultrasonic bath and the distilled water containing the sample particles is then centrifuged. This is the process in which the specimens are spun and separated by density as a result of centripetal force, or due to the fictitious centrifugal force that is felt by the specimens due to their reference frame. Utilizing this force allows for the separation of solutions of different densities. Thus the least dense component, consisting of the starch grain particles is separated and a microscopic slide can be prepared.  Starch Grain: Dental Calculus Removal Methods  Starch grain analysis through dental calculus can provide a plethora of information when it come to diet reconstruction of past societies. Specifically, dental calculus is a layering found on the teeth that is formed from plaque, \\"after mineralization.\\" In a study conducted by Tao et. al, the research group followed the methods laid out by Piperno and Dillehay in 2008 and Li et al. in 2010. In these specific examples, they ground the dental calculus by use of mortar and pestle, and centrifuged the mixture containing the dental calculus as well as small amounts of Calgon in order to break the particles into a dispersed state. Once the extracts were dissolved in hydrochloride and rinsed with acetone, the residues were extracted and comparative analysis could begin. This is just one way in which to go about extracting starch grain residues from dental calculus, with another example being the use of sonification as described above.  Starch Grain: Comparative Structures  There are several structures that are observed when doing comparative analysis to determine the plant taxa in which the starch grain belongs. First, starting on a slightly larger scale, the granule types such as simple, compound, or semi-compound, sizes, and shapes are observed. Next there is the hilum, which is the area in which protein layers are deposited.{{cite web last1=Mozdy first1=Michael title=In the Tiny World of Starch Grains, Bigger is Better website=Natural History Museum of Utah publisher=NMHU Utah Hilums differ in their positioning on the starch granule and this positioning can differ between taxa. In addition to the hilum, \\"lamellas\\" are observed which are the different growth layers in which are only sometimes visible microscopically. The fissures can also be observed, however these are only common in some starch grains, not all. In total, starch grain analysis through the use of a computer database is the primary way in which starch grains are differentiated. This is helpful in terms of a supplemental approach to understanding plant exploitation of past societies. Usefulness Starch grain analysis is not a perfect science, however, plant starch grain analysis is a diagnostic feature of multiple applications according to the peculiarities and to the origin of the plant material. The size, shape and structure of grains from plant species, varies little, which can lead to identification. Starch grains have been removed and identified from stone tools, ceramic sherds, organic materials, dental calculus, and sediments and animal remains to determine diet and when humans began to exploit wild food varieties. Disadvantages In some cases the grains can become degraded. Factors such as heat and water absorption may affect the structure of the grains, making identification more difficult. Even if the remains are well preserved, water logging, dehydration, desiccation or damage from fungi can destroy the starch. In some cases, even within the same species, starch grains can differ in shape and size and the size of the grain affects its survivability in the archaeological record.Field, J. Cosgrove, R. Fullager, R. & Lance, B. (2011) \\"Starch residues on grinding stones in private collections: a study of morahs from the tropical rainforests of NE Queensland\\" in Haslam, M. Robertson, G. Crowther, A. Nugent, S. & Kirkwood,L.(Eds) Archaeological Science Under a Microscope (Terra Australis 30) Studies in Residue and Ancient DNA Analysis in Honour of Thomas H. Loy. ANU E Press. Canberra. 228-238  Biology of starch  Starch is produced in plants as a form of energy storage through the process of photosynthesis. When the plant is in need of energy, the stored starch is converted back into glucose. Starch, 800x magnified, under polarized light, showing characteristic extinction cross Starch grains are typically microscopically identified with either optical or electron microscopy. Starch grains can become clearer if they are stained a darker color with Iodine Stains. Logol's Iodine is one, used for staining starch because iodine reagents easily bind to starch but less easily to other materials. Features that allow identification of starch grains include: presence of hilum (core of the grain), lamellae (or growth layers), birefringence, and extinction cross (a cross shape, visible on grains under revolving polarized light) which are visible with a microscope and shape and size. Low magnification Archaeological research focused on residue adhering to artifacts start at lower magnifications, commonly using a stereoscope. Most data obtained at this stage is qualitative, an important first stage to fuller analysis. Magnifications of between x10 and x50 are sufficient to locate target residues, describe features and confirm internal structures of the identified residues. High magnification Modern light, high powered microscopes have an internal light source, allowing illumination with both transmitted and reflected light. These microscopes can provide a magnification of up to x1000: good enough to provide clear images of starch granules as small as a few micrometres in diameter. Starch granules show different sizes. For example; * Tapioca starch: 5-35 µm * Potato starch: 15-100 µm * Maize starch: 5-25 µm * Rice starch: 3-8 µm but all are generally under 100 micrometres in size, and are, therefore, best observed under compound microscopes equipped with various lighting conditions and magnifications from x200 to x800. The starch grains are also compared to standard reference collections for comparison. Archaeologists and researchers can consider four issues in classification of the plant(s) and its use(s): * Determination of whether evidence for the utilization of plants is present * Study of the assemblage variation * Determination of the presence of particular plant species * Assign percentages of starch granules within a sample to a particular taxon, and present quantitative data regarding relative abundance within the sample. Identification of ancient starch is fairly easily for the first three levels of classification, whilst the fourth level requires continued improvement in the description, classification, and identification of individual starch granules.  Starch in sediments  Starch granules retrieved from sediments are used to reconstruct the habitats associated with human land use. Such studies address two areas of interest to the archaeologist: * landscapes; specifically the reconstruction of historical plant communities at the widest scale of the environment * specific contexts, such as settlements or activity areas; focusing on individual archaeological sites, or separate contexts within them, with the goal of identify specific human activities at a particular location. The stages involved in the analysis of starch from sediments are; sampling, extraction of starch, slide mounting and viewing, and interpretation. Sampling Sampling a sediment core or stratigraphic profile to gather information about an environment requires a detailed understanding of the way the sediments were formed. Extraction Most extraction techniques follow a general methodology of: * sample preparation (sieving, drying, or soaking) * disaggregation and deflocculation to break up the elements of the sample into single particles * removal of undesired particles (sands, silts, minerals, organics). * chemicals preservation of the starch granules. Slide mounting and viewing Starch granules are mounted onto a slide, using a variety of mounting medias including, but not limited, to water, glycerol, and glycerine jelly. It is important that the material is dried thoroughly before being mounted to ensure that no further degradation of the sample occurs. The slide is then viewed, as appropriate, for identification and counting. Interpretation After the starch granules have been examined, the findings are then recorded and interpreted with respect to the research questions that are being investigated.  Starch on artifacts  Artifacts collect starch granules and protect them from decay due to microorganisms, thus providing excellent conditions for long-term preservation. The analysis may focus on the function of the tool, to examine a broader range of human behaviour but starch analysis also allows insights into craft activities involving the preparation of adhesives, medicines, or other nonfood items.  Modified starch  Starch can also be investigated when it is not in its raw form. For example, Modified starch is created when the morphological or physico-chemical structure of native starch is disrupted in some way, such as in food preparation. The most common way to modify starch is to apply heat. Cooking pits, hearths, and ovens that may have come into contact with starchy material yield modified starches which can provide other insights. Modified starch is only likely to be preserved under specific conditions, such as arid regions because of its susceptibility to organic decay. Studies of ancient modified starch aid understanding of ancient food technology, variations in cuisine among different social groups, as well as provide an understanding the function of ancient food-processing equipment. Preserved forms of modified starch include: * Discrete desiccated macroremains: coherent foods that are not attached to any other object and are among the most easily recognizable ancient starchy prepared foodstuffs. They can be either the intended final prepared food, like loaves of bread, or intermediate products of the food processing sequence, like starch-rich, chaffy lumps. * Attached desiccated residues: collections of starchy foodstuffs adhered to a container or vessel. The ability to identify these residues is affected by the quantity and appearance of the residue, as well as the awareness of the excavators. Residues containing obvious plant tissue are most easily recognizable, while thin smears are not as easy to recognize. * Charred residues: normally the result of accidental overcooking and can be preserved as discrete fragments or remain stuck to the cooking vessel. Due to their charred nature, these residues are very difficult to identify. See also * Starch ReferencesBibliography * Hather, J.G. (ed.) 1994.

Early life He was born between 1957 and 1959 in Mayom County, South Sudan. He was an ethnic Bol Nuer. Career Gadet began his military career from 1981 to 1983 in the Sudanese contingent deployed to help Iraq in the Iran–Iraq War. General Gadet was a member of the South Sudan Defence Forces (SSDF) during the Second Sudanese Civil War. He joined the SPLA after the Juba Declaration of 8 January 2006, but said that he was marginalised and that the army was dominated by tribal nepotism. In April 2011 Gadet emerged as leader of the South Sudan Liberation Army (SSLA), a new militia demanding a more broadly-based government. In Unity State, he began an assault on the SPLA, leaving at least 45 people dead. According to the military, 20 of the victims were southern army soldiers. In August 2011, SSLA's spokesperson has said that the movement has declared a ceasefire with the government. Gadet integrated his forces into the army and became the 8th Division Commander. South Sudanese Civil War During the South Sudanese Civil War (starting in December 2013), he mutinied again and his mainly Nuer militia claimed control of Bor, South Sudan. Riek Machar said that Gadet had been installed as military governor of Jonglei. In July 2014, the European Union imposed sanctions on Gadet, accusing him of leading an attack of the town of Bentiu, in which about 400 people were killed in the 2014 Bentiu massacre. On 11 August 2015, Gabriel Tang, Gathoth Gatkuoth, former Sudan People's Liberation Movement-in-Opposition (SPLM-IO) logistics chief, and Gadet announced that they had split from Machar, believing him to be \\"seeking power for himself\\". They rejected ongoing peace talks and announced that they would now combat Machar's forces in addition to government forces, saying, \\"They (Machar and President Salva Kiir) are symbols of hate, division and failed leadership, both leaders were responsible for starting the crisis.\\" Gatkuoth stated that he wished for a President who is neither Dinka nor Nuer, and that he intended to register his group as a political group called the \\"Federal Democratic Party\\". Gadet became Chairman of the Military Command Council of Federal Democratic Party/South Sudan Armed Forces. In January 2015, widespread deliberate killing of civilians took place in Bor by forces under the control of Gadet, including 14 women being killed in a church compound. In May the US imposed sanctions on Gadet. Personal life His wife is the daughter of Gatluak Gai, a rebel general. He was also on the board of advisers of the US-based Jarch Management Group, which has obtained oil concessions on large areas of land in South Sudan. Death Gadet died of a heart attack in Khartoum on 15 July 2019. The Sudan People's Liberation Movement-in-Opposition, led by Machar, issued a message of condolence.

He never lost a battle under his command. Early life and family His birthplace is unclear, as some sources say he was born in Buenos Aires in July 1793, but others, such as the historian Carlos Calvo, say he was born in Santiago de Chile. Other sources say he was born in Buenos Aires but in June 1795. His parents were Julián Pacheco, a Spaniard, and Teresa Concha, who was Chilean. He studied at the Royal College of San Carlos. In 1822, he married María Dolores Reinoso and had six children: José, Román, Julio, Eduardo, Pablo and Elvira. Early career In 1811, he joined Patricios Regiment as a cadet, but on November 22, the year after he was reassigned to the Horse Grenadiers Regiment. This unit had its baptism of fire at the Battle of San Lorenzo. His actions were responsible for providing food and horses for the Grenadiers advancing to San Lorenzo, and as a forward observer in combat he earned a promotion to lieutenant of the first squadron on February 26, 1813. He remained in the convent of San Carlos with a squad of 40 men, with which he defeated a larger landing force in the battle of Rincón de Zárate. He also served in the Siege of Montevideo. In November 1813, he transferred to the Northern Army, and on 4 December was promoted to lieutenant. He covered the withdrawal of Cuban troops after their defeat at Ayohuma Vilcapugio and participated in the actions of then Keeper of the Marquis, Marketing and Media and Sipe Sipe, in which he received a large wound in the arm. In 1815 he was promoted to adjutant. In 1816 he was transferred to Mendoza, where he joined the Army of the Andes, crossing to Chile under General José de San Martín in the column of Mariano Necochea, whose escort was a part. Under the command of Necochea, he participated in the combat of bribery. He fought in the Battle of Chacabuco (12 February 1817), earning a promotion to captain which was conferred on 27 February. He left Buenos Aires to bring trophies in Chacabuco, the Supreme Director Pueyrredón promoted him to sergeant major on 10 March. Back in Chile, he participated in the battles of Curapaligue, Talcahuano, Cancharayada and Maipú. He led the second campaign in southern Chile during 1818 and 1819. Shortly after the Battle of Cepeda he left to serve in Buenos Aires, and was ordered by Governor Manuel Dorrego to lead the campaign against the province of Santa Fe, fighting for the victories at San Nicolas de los Arroyos and Arroyo Pavón, where he defeated Gamonal. For many years he served in the cavalry of the frontier against the Indians ranqueles. He has commanded a battalion of cavalry in the War of Brazil, and excelled in the victory of Ituzaingó. He was the second chief of the No. 3 Cavalry Regiment, whose chief was Colonel Frederick Brandsen, who died in combat. In that same field of battle he took command of the regiment. He also fought in small final battles of the war, including the Camacuá. After the latter, the May 1, 1827 Colonel received shipments of cash, and on 7 September was appointed commander in chief of the Northern Department of the province of Buenos Aires. Civil War and the Indian border In 1828, Colonel Frederick Rauch was replaced as head of the northern border with the Indians, based in Salto, by order of Governor Dorrego, which earned him the hatred of Prussia. He was a school official and as such, wanted to remain detached from civil strife. But, as understood as a military mission was to sustain the constituted authorities, it resulted in civil war. He refused to endorse John Lavalle in the revolution of December 1828 and wanted to help Dorrego, who was defeated before he could join, and finished in the refugee regiment Pacheco. His second in command, Mariano Acha, fell to the forces of the rebels and was arrested by Dorrego Lavalle, who shot him. He took refuge in Santa Fe and returned with Juan Manuel de Rosas, who led the campaign that ended with the defeat of Lavalle, after the battle of Puente de Márquez. He later headed the campaign of 1831 against the League of Interior led by General Jose Maria Paz and Stephen Pederson. His victory was due to his correct tactics, but more importantly to the defection of many of the enemy soldiers, former soldiers of Facundo Quiroga forcibly incorporated into the army unit. With that victory began the fall of the League, which led him to occupy the city of Cordoba. Following his victory in Fraile Muerto he was promoted to colonel. He made the desert campaign in 1833 as chief of staff to Rose, and reached what is now the city of Neuquén. On his return he was promoted to general, and during the crisis of those years he was elected governor, but denied the charge. During the following years was a deputy provincial minister of war several times, and inspector of war. Rose was a personal friend, and became a major landowner, in large part due to awards from the government. The campaign within In August 1840, General Lavalle invaded the province of Buenos Aires, landing in San Pedro. Pacheco did not have enough forces to face him, so they scattered their horses and surrounded them. Lavalle rose to near Buenos Aires, but was trapped between the forces of Pacheco and Roses, resulting in their eventual defeat. Pacheco gave chase to Santa Fe under the command of General Manuel Oribe, former President of Uruguay, and his command fought at the Battle of Quebracho Herrado as head of the cavalry. Their federal action decided the victory. When Lavalle came back to La Rioja, Mendoza sent Colonel Vilela their best forces. Pacheco with a smaller force, chased and defeated him during a surprise night attack in San Cala. He returned to Cordoba, where months later went to Cuyo: there was going to the army unit Lamadrid. After taking San Juan, he retired to Mendoza. Pacheco took command of an army that included José Félix Mendoza Aldana and Nazario Benavides, with whom Lamadrid tore apart in the bloody battle of Rodeo del Medio. There ended the civil war started more than two years earlier. In the battle of Arroyo Grande, 6 December 1842, ordered the army infantry affiliates of the Confederation and the \\"white\\" Uruguayan - whose commander in chief was deposed president Manuel Oribe East - against the forces of \\"red\\" Uruguayan and Argentine unit led by Fructuoso Rivera. Pacheco's conduct of the troops was decisive, destroying the center and the artillery of the enemy. During 1843 and 1844 participated in the siege of Montevideo. In 1845 he was appointed head of the Frontier Centre Buenos Aires province, fought off attempts to raid ranqueles Indians, and ordered to form a strong and Mulitas Bragado (now the town of Twenty-May). In 1850 he was elected a member of the Legislature of the Province. Later years and death In 1851, Justo José de Urquiza took the lead in opposition to Rosas. After invading and overthrowing the Uruguay Oribe, also invaded Santa Fe, and from there moved to Buenos Aires. For the first time, Pacheco and Rosas disagreed with the strategy to follow, and the governor was wary of his general. Feeling left out, Pacheco retired to his room. He then assumed command of the army, Brigadier General Rosas, a shrewd politician, but little military capacity. He was defeated at the Battle of Caseros, the February 2, 1852 and forced to resign and go into exile. Pacheco also left home and traveled the American continent, with particular attention to Havana. Pacheco's tomb He returned to Buenos Aires after the revolution of 11 September that year, when Buenos Aires was dominated by the old unit and separated from the rest of the country. Organized the defence of the capital during the siege imposed on him general Hilario Lagos. He retired military in mid-1853. During the following years he was minister of war of the State of Buenos Aires, and special envoy to the government of Brazil. Spent the rest of his days in his stay Talar, now known as \\"Talar de Pacheco. \\" According to Ernesto Quesada, \\"asked not to be political either before, during or after Rosas. His badge of honor, glory, was to have been a soldier of St. Martin: she did not aspire to something else. born with the military vocation and she died without have given up only once in his life. He was a man of the world's legendary gallantry with the ladies, being known his deep respect for women in general. \\" He died in Buenos Aires in 1869. In the act of burial of the remains discussed among others, the poet Carlos Guido y Spano and General Bartolomé Mitre. He was buried in the cemetery of Recoleta. Notes 1\\\\. This year of birth would be more consistent with his record of military service, and that would be correct sitting position as a cadet at age 17 Patricios.

The ship was carrying a cargo including 'benzine' and was near Dunk Island when, at 5 am, there was a violent explosion in the after hold, followed almost immediately by an explosion in the forward hold. Flames higher than the mast emerged from the after hold and set fire to the ship's boats and superstructure. The first mate was sitting on a hatch at the time of the first explosion and disappeared; some human bones were found later inside the vessel. He was the only fatality, although the engineer was badly burned. The crew fought the raging fire for some hours. The crew were rescued by the Karuah, with all being taken aboard by 1 pm. The Karuah towed the still blazing hulk to Townsville and her crew later claimed salvage rights. The hull was rebought from the underwriters and refitted in 1921 at the Cleveland Foundry slipway in Townsville. She returned to service, in August 1921, carrying sugar. She was requisitioned by the RAN in June 1942 for service as a lighter during World War II and she was returned to her owners at the end of hostilities. She was sold in 1954 to Hopewell Steam Shipping Company Ltd and renamed Kgari. Fate She was scuttled at Roy Rufus Reef, Hervey Bay on 19 September 1976.

Taxonomy This plant is classified by several different botanical names besides Sambucus cerulea. Both the current USDA database and The Jepson Manual of California flora (2013) classify the plant as Sambucus nigra subsp. cerulea. The Sunset Western Garden Book identifies the plant as Sambucus mexicana, and note use of Sambucus caerulea also. The botanist Victor King Chesnut (1867-1938) had classified it as Sambucus glauca in 1902, when studying the plants used by the Indigenous peoples of California in Mendocino County. Distribution Sambucus cerulea is native to the Western United States, northwestern Mexico, and British Columbia. It is found from the Pacific coasts, through California and the Great Basin, to Montana, Wyoming, Texas and Oklahoma. This species grows at elevations below , in diverse habitats of mountains and hills, valleys, riparian zones, open places in woodlands and forests, and exposed slopes where moisture is reachable. Description Sambucus cerulea is a large, deciduous shrub, which can grow to be in height and in width. It is distinguishable from other elderberries by the glaucous powder coating on its bluish-black berries. It normally grows rather wildly from several stems, which can be heavily pruned (or even cut to the ground) during winter dormancy. The leaves are hairless, strongly pointed and sharp-toothed. They are elliptical to lanceolate, and the blade extends unequally on the stalk at the base. The leaves are commonly long and wide. The white or creamy coloured flowers, occurring May to June, are numerous and form a flat-topped cluster usually about wide. They are umbel-shaped, normally with 4 to 5 rays extending from the base. The flowers have a strong, unpleasant odor. Individual flowers are 4–7 mm wide. The fruits given are berry-like drupes. They are juicy, round, and approximately 4–6 mm in diameter. They are bluish-black appearing as a pale powdery blue colour. Each fruit contains 3 to 5 small seed-like stones, each enclosing a single seed. Berries with glaucous powder coating Sambucus cerulea - MHNT Uses=Native American The indigenous peoples of North America, with the plant in their homelands, use the leaves, blossoms, bark, roots, and wood for preparing traditional medicinal remedies, taken internally or applied externally. The fresh, dried, and cooked berries are used for food. Some tribes used the wood to make musical instruments, such as flutes, clappers, and small whistles; and smoking implements. Soft wood was used as a spindle \\"twirling stick\\" to make fire by friction. The bark was used to produce a remedy for fever. Stems and berries were used as a dye for basket weaving materials. The Concow tribe of the Mendocino region called the plant nō-kōm-hē-i′-nē in the Konkow language. Cultivation Sambucus nigra ssp. cerulea is cultivated as an ornamental plant by plant nurseries, for planting in traditional, native plant, and habitat gardens. It is also used for natural landscaping and habitat restoration projects. It can become a multi-trunk tree when trained from youth with only several dominant trunks. The plant is beneficial in wildlife gardens, its flowers attract pollinators, butterflies and hummingbirds, and its berries feed other bird species and chipmunks.

Peterson to build a replacement for Quickstep, which burned at her dock earlier that month. The new ship incorporated the engine from Quickstep, which was salvaged after the fire. The new ship was christened Lady of the Lake. By June, 1897, Captain Anderson was sailing his old route from Leschi Park to Newcastle to East Seattle on Mercer Island with his new ship. By August 1897, however, he had sold Lady of the Lake to C. E. Curtis of Whatcom for $4,700, and bought Curtis' old ship, the steamer Effort, for $17.

The origin of the fire was reported to be \\"not ascertained\\", with the vessel suffering approximately $3000 in damage. The rate war and the circumstances of the fire caused a rumor that arson was the cause. In any case, the vessel was a total loss. The hull and engines were salvageable however. Rebuild and final loss In 1905, King and Winge rebuilt Lady of the Lake into the tug Ruth. In 1916, Ruth was being operated by Pacific Tow Boat Company, when the vessel was destroyed by fire at Ladysmith, BC.

The network exhibits heterogeneity and a core-periphery structure: the core of the network consists of metal products, machinery, and chemicals, whereas the periphery is formed by fishing, tropical, and cereal agriculture. The clusters of products in this space bear a striking resemblance to Leamer's product classification system. The Product Space is a network that formalizes the idea of relatedness between products traded in the global economy. The network first appeared in the July 2007 issue of Science in the article \\"The Product Space Conditions the Development of Nations,\\"C.A. Hidalgo, B. Klinger, A.-L. Barabási, R. Hausmann, Science 317 (2007). written by Cesar A. Hidalgo, Bailey Klinger, Ricardo Hausmann, and Albert-László Barabási. The Product Space network has considerable implications for economic policy, as its structure helps elucidate why some countries undergo steady economic growth while others become stagnant and are unable to develop. The concept has been further developed and extended by The Observatory of Economic Complexity, through visualizations such as the Product Exports Treemaps and new indexes such as the Economic Complexity Index (ECI), which have been condensed into the Atlas of Economic Complexity. From the new analytic tools developed, Hausmann, Hidalgo and their team have been able to elaborate predictions of future economic growth. Background Conventional economic development theory has been unable to decipher the role of various product types in a country's economic performance.A. Hirschman, The Strategy of Economic Development (Yale University Press, New Haven, CT, 1958).P. Rosenstein-Rodan, Econ. J 53, 202 (1943).K. Matsuyama, J. Econ. Theory 58, 317 (1992). Traditional ideals suggest that industrialization causes a “spillover” effect to new products, fostering subsequent growth. This idea, however, had not been incorporated in any formal economic models. The two prevailing approaches explaining a country's economy focus on either the country's relative proportion of capital and other productive factorsE. Heckscher, B. Ohlin, Heckscher-Ohlin Trade Theory, H. Flam, M. Flanders, Eds. (MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1991). or on differences in technological capabilities and what underlies them.P. Romer, J Polit. Econ. 94, 5 (1986). These theories fail to capture inherent commonalities among products, which undoubtedly contribute to a country's pattern of growth. The Product Space presents a novel approach to this problem, formalizing the intuitive idea that a country which exports bananas is more likely to next export mangoes than it is to export jet engines, for example. The forest analogy The idea of the Product Space can be conceptualized in the following manner: consider a product to be a tree, and the collection of all products to be a forest. A country consists of a set of firms—in this analogy, monkeys—which exploit products, or here, live in the trees. For the monkeys, the process of growth means moving from a poorer part of the forest, where the trees bear little fruit, to a better part of the forest. To do this, the monkeys must jump distances; that is, redeploy (physical, human, and institutional) capital to make new products. Traditional economic theory disregards the structure of the forest, assuming that there is always a tree within reach. However, if the forest is not homogeneous, there will be areas of dense tree growth in which the monkeys must exert little effort to reach new trees, and sparse regions in which jumping to a new tree is very difficult. In fact, if some areas are very deserted, monkeys may be unable to move through the forest at all. Therefore, the structure of the forest and a monkey's location within it dictates the monkey's capacity for growth; in terms of economy, the topology of this “product space” impacts a country's ability to begin producing new goods. Building the Product Space There exists a number of factors that can describe the relatedness between a pair of products: the amount of capital required for production, technological sophistication, or inputs and outputs in a product's value chain, for examples. Choosing to study one of these notions assume the others are relatively unimportant; instead, the Product Space considers an outcome-based measure built on the idea that if a pair of products are related because they require similar institutions, capital, infrastructure, technology, etc., they are likely to be produced in tandem. Dissimilar goods, on the other hand, are less likely to be co-produced. This a posteriori test of similarity is called “proximity.” The concept of ‘proximity’ The Product Space quantifies the relatedness of products with a measure called proximity. In the above tree analogy, proximity would imply the closeness between a pair of trees in the forest. Proximity formalizes the intuitive idea that a country's ability to produce a product depends on its ability to produce other products: a country which exports apples most probably has conditions suitable for exporting pears: the country would already have the soil, climate, packing equipment, refrigerated trucks, agronomists, phytosanitary laws, and working trade agreements. All of these could be easily redeployed to the pear business. These inputs would be futile, however, if the country instead chose to start producing a dissimilar product such as copper wire or home appliances. While quantifying such overlap between the set of markets associated with each product would be difficult, the measure of proximity uses an outcome-based method founded on the idea that similar products (apples and pears) are more likely to be produced in tandem than dissimilar products (apples and copper wire). The RCA is a rigorous standard by which to consider competitive exportation in the global market. In order to exclude marginal exports, a country is said to export a product when they exhibit a Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) in it. Using the BalassaB. Balassa, The Review of Economics and Statistics 68, 315 (1986). definition of RCA, x(c,i) equals the value of exports in country c in the ith good. \\\\text{RCA}_{c,i}=\\\\frac{{x(c,i)}/{\\\\sum_i x(c,i)}} {{\\\\sum_c x(c, i)}/{\\\\sum_{c,i}x(c,i)}} If the RCA value exceeds one, the share of exports of a country in a given product is larger than the share of that product in all global trade. Under this measure, when RCA(c,i) is greater than or equal to 1, country c is said to export product i. When RCA(c,i) is less than 1, country c is not an effective exporter of i. With this convention, the proximity between a pair of goods i and j is defined in the following way: :\\\\phi_{i,j} = \\\\min{\\\\Pr(\\\\text{RCA} x_i \\\\geq 1 \\\\mid \\\\text{RCA} x_j \\\\geq 1), \\\\Pr(\\\\text{RCA} x_j \\\\geq 1 \\\\mid \\\\text{RCA} x_i \\\\geq 1)} \\\\Pr(\\\\text{RCA}_i \\\\geq 1 \\\\mid \\\\text{RCA}_j \\\\geq 1) is the conditional probability of exporting good i given that you export good j. By considering the minimum of both conditional probabilities, we eliminate the problem that arises when a country is the sole exporter of a particular good: the conditional probability of exporting any other good given that one would be equal to one for all other goods exported by that country. Source data The Product Space uses international trade data from Feenstra, Lipset, Deng, Ma, and Mo's World Trade Flows: 1962-2000 dataset,R.R. Feenstra, H.D. Lipsey, A. Ma, H. Mo, HBER Work. Pap 11040 (2005). cleaned and made compatible through a National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) project. The dataset contains exports and imports both by country of origin and by destination. Products are disaggregated according to the Standardized International Trade Code at the four-digit level (SITC-4). Focusing on data from 1998-2000 yields 775 product classes and provides for each country the value exported to all other countries for each class. From this, a 775-by-775 matrix of proximities between every pair of products is created.A. The Product Space matrix sorted by SITC4 classification. B. The Product Space hierarchically sorted reveals modularity and that 775 products are actively traded. Matrix representation Each row and column of this matrix represents a particular good, and the off-diagonal entries in this matrix reflect the proximity between a pair of products. A visual representation of the proximity matrix reveals high modularity: some goods are highly connected and others are disconnected. Furthermore, the matrix is sparse. Five percent of its elements equal zero, 32% are less than 0.1, and 65% of the entries are below 0.2. Because of the sparseness, a network visualization is an appropriate way to represent this dataset. The Product Space network A network representation of the proximity matrix helps to develop intuition about its structure by establishing a visualization in which traditionally subtle trends become easily identifiable. Maximum spanning tree The initial step in building a network representation of product relatedness (proximities) involved first generating a network framework. The maximum spanning tree represents the first step in visualizing the Product Space network.Here, the maximum spanning tree (MST) algorithm built a network of the 775 product nodes and the 774 links that would maximize the network's total proximity value. Network layout The force-directed spring layout above includes the links from the MST and any edge with a proximity greater than 0.55. To achieve the final Product Space design, the dense clusters were manually untangled and attributes were added in terms of node/link size and color. The basic \\"skeleton\\" of the network is developed by imposing on it the strongest links which were not necessarily in the MST by employing a threshold on the proximity values; they chose to include all links of proximity greater than or equal to 0.55. This produced a network of 775 nodes and 1525 links. This threshold was chosen such that the network exhibited an average degree equal to 4, a common convention for effective network visualizations. With the framework complete, a force- directed spring algorithm was used to achieve a more ideal network layout. This algorithm considers each node to be a charged particle and the links are assumed to be springs; the layout is the resulting equilibrium, or relaxed, position of the system. Manual rearranging untangled dense clusters to achieve maximum aesthetic efficacy. Node and link attributes A system of colors and sizing allows for simultaneous assessment of the network structure with other covariates. The nodes of the Product Space are colored in terms of product classifications performed by LeamerE. Leamer, Sources of Comparative Advantage: Theory and Evidence (MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1984). and the size of the nodes reflects the proportion of money moved by that particular industry in world trade. The color of the links reflects the strength of the proximity measurement between two products: dark red and blue indicate high proximity whereas yellow and light blue imply weaker relatedness. There are also other types of classifications applied to the Product Space methodology,J. Romero, E. Freitas, G. Britto, C. Coelho (2015). The great divide: the paths of industrial competitiveness in Brazil and South Korea (No. 519). Cedeplar, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais. as the one proposed by LallS. Lall, \\"The Technological structure and performance of developing country manufactured exports, 1985‐98.\\" Oxford development studies 28.3 (2000): 337-369. which classificates the products by technological intensity. Properties of the Product Space In the final Product Space visualization, it is clear that the network exhibits heterogeneity and a core-periphery structure: the core of the network consists of metal products, machinery, and chemicals, whereas the periphery is formed by fishing, tropical, and cereal agriculture. On the left side of the network, there is a strong outlying cluster formed by garments and another belonging to textiles. At the bottom of the network, there exists a large electronics cluster, and at its right mining, forest, and paper products. The clusters of products in this space bear a striking resemblance to Leamer's product classification system, which employed an entirely different methodology. This system groups products by the relative amount of capital, labor, land, or skills needed to export each product. The Product Space also reveals a more explicit structure within product classes. Machinery, for example, appears to be naturally split into two clusters: heavy machinery in one, and vehicles and electronics in the other. Although the machinery cluster is connected to some capital-intensive metal products, it is not interwoven with similarly classified products such as textiles. In this way, the Product Space presents a new perspective on product classification. Dynamics of the Product Space The Product Space network can be used to study the evolution of a country's productive structure. A country's orientation within the space can be determined by observing where its products with RCA>1 are located. The images at right reveal patterns of specialization: the black squares indicate products exported by each region with RCA>1. Localization of the productive structure for different regions of the world. The products for which the region has an RCA > 1 are denoted by black squares. It can be seen that industrialized countries export products at the core, such as machinery, chemicals, and metal products. They also, however, occupy products at the periphery, like textiles, forest products, and animal agriculture. East Asian countries exhibit advantage in textiles, garments, and electronics. Latin America and the Caribbean have specialized in industries further towards the periphery, such as mining, agriculture, and garments. Sub-Saharan Africa demonstrates advantage in few product classes, all of which occupy the product space periphery. From these analyses, it is clear that each region displays a recognizable pattern of specialization easily discernible in the product space. Empirical diffusion The same methods can be used to observe a country's development over time. By using the same conventions of visualization, it can be seen that countries move to new products by traversing the Product Space. Two measures quantify this movement through the Product Space from unoccupied products (products in which a given country has no advantage) to occupied products (products in which that country has an RCA>1). Such products are termed “transition products.” The \\"density\\" is defined as a new product's proximity to a given country's current set of products: :\\\\omega_j^k = \\\\frac{ {\\\\displaystyle \\\\sum_i x_i \\\\phi_{ij} } }{ {\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_i \\\\phi_{ij} } } A high density reflects that a country has many developed products surrounding the unoccupied product j. It was found that products which were not produced in 1990 but were produced by 1995 (transition products) exhibited higher density, implying that this value predicts a transition to an unoccupied product. The “discovery factor” measurement corroborates this idea: :H_j = \\\\frac{ {\\\\displaystyle \\\\sum_{k=1}^T \\\\omega_j^k / T} }{ {\\\\displaystyle \\\\sum_{k=T+1}^N \\\\omega_j^k / (N - T)} } H_j reflects the average density of all countries in which the jth product was a transition product and the average density of all countries in which the jth product was not developed. For 79% of products, this ratio exceeds 1, indicating that density is likely to predict a transition to a new product. Simulated diffusion The impact of Product Space's structure can be evaluated through simulations in which a country repeatedly moves to new products with proximities above a given threshold. At a threshold of proximity equal to 0.55, countries are able to diffuse through the core of the Product Space but the speed at which they do so is determined by the set of initial products. By raising the threshold to 0.65, some countries, whose initial products occupy periphery industries, become trapped and cannot find any near- enough products. This implies that a country's orientation within the space can in fact dictate whether the country achieves economic growth. Future work Although the dynamics of a country's orientation within the network has been studied, there has been less focus on changes in the network topology itself. It is suggested that \\"changes in the product space represent an interesting avenue for future work.\\"C.A. Hidalgo, B. Klinger, A.-L. Barabási, R. Hausmann, Science 317 485 (2007). Additionally, it would be interesting to explore the mechanisms governing countries' economic growth, in terms of acquisition of new capital, labor, institutions, etc., and whether the co- export proximity of the Product Space is truly an accurate reflection of similarity among such inputs.

Typically, these clefs place each staff line a third lower than usual. (A second possible set of clefs, in contrabasso, places each staff line a third higher; this is less common outside of Franco-Flemish compositions.) 400px The first author to mention a standard set of high clefs is Silvestro Ganassi dal Fontego, in his 1543 Regula Rubertina, chapter 22, which instructs the musician to transpose such music down a fifth. Other theorists, such as Adriano Banchieri (1601) and Picerli (1631), indicate to transpose down a fifth if there is no key signature, and a fourth if there is a flat indicated. By mid-century, Italian commentators only mention a transposition down a fourth, and still later the practice seems to have been to transpose downward by a third to account for the high pitch of Italian organs. The Austrian theorist Johann Baptist Samber (1707), meanwhile, gave as his rule to transpose downward by a fourth if the bass is notated in F3, but a fifth if it is notated in C4. The practice of transposition does not seem to have been universal; Thomas Morley implies that music ought to be sung in the key in which it was written while Michael Praetorius indicates the choice to transpose or not depends on the ensemble. Banchieri (1609) indicates that instrumental music should be read at pitch, in the higher clefs, while singers use the chiavi naturali at the written pitch. This set of higher clefs was only given the name chiavette in the eighteenth century, by Girolamo Chiti (1718), by which time the practice itself had largely disappeared; by the mid- seventeenth century, most composers had adopted more flexible notational practices. It continued to linger in Rome, however, and was used at the papal chapel into the nineteenth century. Performance of pieces written in chiavette approximately a fourth lower than notated often results in a more consistent set of ranges across a given collection, although this is not always reflected in modern performing editions and recordings.

Early life  Karin Michaëlis was the daughter of a telegraph official and noted Freemason, Jacob Anthonius Brøndum (1837–1921), and his wife Nielsine Petrine Bech (1839–1932). She was brought up together with her younger sister, the later philanthropist Alma Dahlerup, in their modest home in Randers where her mother contributed to the family's meager income by making wreaths. Her grandmother and an aunt played a large role in her early upbringing. In Pigen med Glasskaarene (Girl with Glass Pieces) (first volume of the master work Træet på Godt og Ondt, written in the period 1924-30), she gave a picture of that milieu. In school she was teased because she was small, chubby, and suffered from strabismus.  Copenhagen and marriage to Sophus Michaëlis  In her youth Michaëlis was a private teacher for a few years, partly in Læsø and partly in a manor house north of Randers. In 1892 she moved to Copenhagen, to become trained as a piano teacher, where she became acquainted with the writer Sophus Michaëlis (1865–1932), whom she married in 1895. The couple earned their living predominantly through theater reviews. In 1911 the marriage was terminated.  Second marriage and writing career  The following year, Michaëlis married the Norwegian-American diplomat Charles Emil Stangeland in New Rochelle, New York. She had met Stangeland the previous year while returning from the U.S. to Denmark aboard a ship. He was a political economist, educated at Columbia University, and at the time of his marriage to Michaëlis was posted to Bolivia as secretary to the American Legation. Stangeland was unhappy with the literary and political activities of his wife, who just at this time experienced a breakthrough as an author with Den farlige Alder (The Dangerous Age). They were separated in 1917 and divorced in 1930. There were no children from either marriage.  Political and social activity  During World War I Michaëlis was active in humanitarian work in Austria. Her great friendship with Eugenie Schwarzwald stood not only for her connection with Vienna but also for her social engagement in this country. Early on, Karin Michaëlis warned of the danger arising from Mussolini and Hitler. In 1932 she took part in an anti-war congress in Amsterdam where she advocated conscientious objection and peace education for children. From 1933 on she took in German emigrants on her property in Thurø, including Bertolt Brecht and his wife Helene Weigel. After the rise of fascism, her books were banned in Germany and Italy. In 1940, with the invasion of Denmark, she herself emigrated to America; in 1946, after the end of World War II, she returned to Denmark. She is buried in the Thurø cemetery.  Works  In the course of 50 years, Karin Michaëlis wrote 36 novels for adults, nine children's books, and two autobiographies, plus many other books and a number of newspaper and periodical articles. In 1910 she published Den farlige Alder (The Dangerous Age). It is the story of Elsie Lindtner, who, after divorcing her husband, attempts to rekindle a relationship with a younger man who had once worshipped her from afar. When this relationship fails as well, she resolves to spend her life traveling throughout the world with a female friend. The book created a great sensation, because it began to cut through tabooed themes like the sexual desires of a 40-year-old woman. The novel was translated many times and filmed several times, including a 1927 version with Asta Nielsen.fembio.org(German) Among the articles she wrote for American magazines were a two-part series for Munsey's Magazine in 1913, entitled \\"Why Are Women Less Truthful Than Men\\" and an interview with Woodrow Wilson for Living Age Magazine in 1925, \\"On President Wilson's Trail\\" In 1914, Glaedens Skole (School of Joy) was published, about a reform school in Vienna led by her friend, the Austrian pedagogue Eugenie Schwarzwald. Michaëlis also wrote a series of books about the growing up experiences of a girl called Bibi. The Bibi books came in seven volumes from 1929 to 1939 and became a big international success. In these novels for adolescents, readers meet the stationmaster's daughter Bibi, who is motherless, but as a result free. She is an idealistic tomboy who rides free on the streetcars and fights ceaselessly for animal causes. Finally, the autobiographies Little Troll and Vidunderlige Verden (Wonderful World) were published in the 1940s.

She was named for Brigadier General John Armstrong, Sr., who fought in the American Revolutionary War. War of 1812 General Armstrong was based in New York City and crewed by about 90 men. Captain Tim Barnard commanded the ship in 1812. Guy Richards Champlin led the ship from 1813 through July 1814, followed by Captain Samuel Chester Reid until the ship's September 1814 scuttling in Faial.History of the American Privateers, George Coggeshall She was armed with seven guns, including a 42-pounder Long Tom cannon. Queen On 11 November 1812 the General Armstrong—armed with 16 guns and 40 men—attacked the English ship Queen. Queen, headed by an individual named Conkey, was sailing from Liverpool to Suriname with cargo valued at £90,000. Her crew resisted and did not strike her colours until the captain, first officer, and nine of the crew were killed. Queen was possibly one of the most valuable prizes captured by American privateers during the War of 1812. A prize crew began sailing Queen to the United States, but wrecked it off the Nantucket coast. Battle of Suriname River On 11 March 1813 the General Armstrong was sailing in the mouth of the Suriname River when she encountered a vessel the crew presumed to be a British privateer but was, in fact, the British sloop .PICTORIAL FIELD- BOOK OF THE WAR OF 1812. BENSON J. LOSSING, 1869. The ensuing battle severely damaged General Armstrong. Its captain Guy Richards Champlin was injured and threatened to blow up the ship if the crew surrendered. General Armstrong ultimately escaped. In his log-book Champlin wrote: \\"In this action we had six men killed and sixteen wounded, and all the halyards of the headsails shot away; the fore-mast and bowsprit one quarter cut through, and all the fore and main shrouds but one shot away; both mainstays and running rigging cut to pieces; a great number of shot through our sails, and several between wind and water, which caused our vessel to leak. There were also a number of shot in our hull.\\" General Armstrong returned to the United States, arriving in Charleston on 4 April. General Armstrong's shareholders awarded Champlin a sword for saving the ship from capture or destruction.Niles' Weekly Register, Saturday, April 24, 1813 Battle of Fayal General Armstrong is perhaps most remembered for her involvement in the Battle of Fayal, under the captaincy of Samuel Chester Reid, on 26 and 27 September 1814. In the engagement, the British brig-sloop and several boats armed with cannon and carrying sailors and marines attempted to cut out the General Armstrong. General Armstrong repulsed the attacks but Captain Reid felt he could not escape the Azores so he ordered the General Armstrong scuttled after fighting off the Carnation a second time on 27 September. The Americans made it to shore where Portuguese authorities and the American consul John Bass Dabney protected them. American casualties amounted to two killed and seven wounded, while the British lost 36 men killed and 93 wounded. General Armstrong also sunk two British boats and captured two others. \\"Night battle of the Privateer Brig \\"General Armstrong\\" of New York\\", by Emanuel Leutze. Other engagements=1812 Two days after General Armstrong captured Queen, it captured Lucy & Alida (captained by Deamy), a ship sailing from Suriname to Liverpool with dry goods. However, the letter of marque Barton of Liverpool recaptured Lucy & Alida.Lloyd's List №4773.There were two Liverpool-based ships named Barton sailing at that time— and —and it is not clear which one recaptured Lucy & Alida. The American privateer Revenge of Norfolk later captured Lucy & Alinda.Niles' Weekly Register, Saturday, January 23, 1813Lloyd's List №4761.

In 1812 she also captured Sir Sidney Smith, which was ordered to port but foundered off Nantucket,The cargo of Sir Sidney Smith was the subject of a case in New York prize courts. and the brig Union, originally sailing from Guernsey to Saint Kitts and sent to New York after its capture.Niles' Weekly Register, Saturday, December 12, 1812 1813 In 1813 General Armstrong captured and burned an unnamed schooner and an unnamed brig that were sailing to France.Niles' Weekly Register, Saturday, September 11, 1813Niles' Weekly Register, Saturday, October 2, 1813 1814 The General Armstrong captured multiple ships throughout 1814. In January she captured the sloop Resolution, which was sailing from Jersey for Lisbon with linen and paper, seizing her cargo and releasing her. That month General Armstrong also captured and scuttled the brig Phoebe, which sailed from Forney for Madeira laden with butter and potatoes.Niles' Weekly Register, Saturday, January 29, 1814 On 19 April 1814 General Armstrong captured the eighteen-gun British letter of marque Fanny and its 45-man crew off the coast of Ireland. Fanny had been sailing from Maranhão to Liverpool. The engagement lasted about an hour and was described as a \\"severe\\" close-range action fought within \\"pistol shot range.\\" Eventually the British struck their colors after several men were killed or wounded. The General Armstrong's crew lost one killed and six wounded; Fanny lost a like number out of a much smaller crew. The British third-rate ship later recaptured Fanny. On 26 April 1814 Lloyd's List reported the General Armstrong was seized and the crew taken prisoner when she put into Dunkirk.Lloyd's List 26 April 1814 However, the crew was later released and General Armstrong allowed to sail.Niles' Weekly Register, Saturday July 9, 1814 On 25 June 1814 General Armstrong captured the Portuguese ship Mercury but allowed her to proceed as she was neutral.Chronological Tables, Francis Shallis, Philadelphia, 1817 On 19 July 1814 General Armstrong captured the sloop Henrietta, which was bound to Chesapeake with stores, and sent her to Egg Harbor.Niles' Weekly Register, Saturday July 30, 1814 According to Niles' Register, during the rest of 1814 the General Armstrong captured various other prizes: * brig Duke of York, of Greenock, captured and burnt * sloop George, laden with pork, captured off the Ireland coast and sunk * brig Swift, in ballast, captured and made into a cartel ship * brig Defiance, laden with whiskey, butter, and bread and bound for Lisbon, captured and burnt * brig Friendship, laden as above, captured and burnt * brig Stag, laden with a full and very valuable cargo of dry goods, captured and divested of some articles and burnt in sight of a British frigate, brig, and schooner * ship Dorcas, out of Anguilla, captured by the General Armstrong's boats and sunk * three other very valuable prizes, captured, manned by prize crews, and ordered into port. Of these last three ships listed in Niles' Register, one may have been Fanny. Another may have been the Sir Alexander Ball, which General Armstrong captured after a short engagement some west of Lisbon. Sir Alexander Ball had six men wounded, two probably fatally. Champlin sent her crew into Lisbon, and sent her with a prize crew for America. However, recaptured Sir Alexander Ball and by 20 July 1814 she was at Halifax, Nova Scotia, being condemned as a prize to Niemen. Of the prizes the General Armstrong captured and ordered to port, about a third were recaptured. Battle-damaged and short-manned, they were fairly easily recaptured. Niles' Register details the plight of one such captured vessel: > Shifting Owners! The prize schooner to the General Armstrong (lately arrived > at an Eastern Port) was formerly the Matilda, American privateer. She was > captured on the Brazil coast, some months since, by the Lion, British > privateer ship of 28 guns, after severe action, recaptured going into > England by the late U.S. Brig Argus, re-captured going into France by a > British 74, and again re-captured by the American privateer Armstrong. General Armstrong arrived in home port in late July 1814. Samuel Reid took over as captain and departed Sandy Hook on 9 September 1814, a few weeks before the fateful Battle of Fayal. Legacy Claims for damages arising out of the General Armstrong's sinking lasted for over 70 years. One such claim drove the plot of The Senator, a popular play of the 1890s later adapted into a silent film.The Letters of Henry Adams, p. 215 (1982)(27 November 1889).

It is colloquially referred to by native speakers as Cǐdì-huà (此地话; lit.: local speech, or \\"this-place speech\\"). It is spoken in the city of Hohhot, in Inner Mongolia, and Zhangjiakou in Hebei Province in China. One of its sub-branches is Hohhot dialect (), which is also locally referred as Hūshì-huà (呼市话; lit. Hu-city speech). The other sub-branch is Zhangjiakou dialect (). There is notable dialectal variation within the two cities. People in the Jiu-cheng area (Yuquan District), especially the Muslim Hui minority speak in a dialect very similar to what is heard in neighbouring Shanxi province and is undoubtedly a branch of the Jin linguistic group. The Mandarin dialect in Xincheng District is a branched combination of the Jin, Hebei dialect, Northeastern Mandarin, and elements of the Manchu language, caused by the migration patterns to the region. It has thus created a distinct linguistic style. The two spoken forms of the Hohhot dialect are only partially intelligible to each other. Like most Jin dialects, the Jiucheng Hohhot dialect uses the glottal stop, and is mutually intelligible with many dialects in neighboring Shanxi. In its full-fledged form, however, it is only partially intelligible with Standard Chinese. Arguably the most eccentric sound is the \\"nge\\" sound used to express \\"I\\". Many expressions in the dialect has crossed over itself with the Mandarin taught in schools to create \\"Hohhot Mandarin\\", or what is commonly heard on the street. Notable features of the Hohhot dialect include: *A special intonation for yes-no questions, which is characterized by a prolonged contour at the end of the sentence. *Mandarin completive \\"ba\\" (吧) is often changed into \\"và\\" (哇) especially in suggestions. *\\"ya\\" (呀) is used at the end of a sentence to form future tense. *Renjia (人家), an expression used to refer to someone in third person, is pronounced \\"niá\\". *The word that corresponds to the Mandarin \\"wǒ\\" (\\"I\\") is pronounced \\"é\\" or \\"wě\\", which is possibly a weak form of the \\"nge\\" form. A vulgar slang term for \\"I' is \\"yé 爷 \\", which is used mostly by less well-educated men, and those who want to sound tough and manly. *Notable aspiration of p, t, and k sounds. The above elements are generally seen in the Jin sub-branch of \\"raw\\" Hohhot dialect, which has its own exclusive elements: *The absence of the \\"zh\\", \\"ch\\", and \\"sh\\" sounds. They are respectively changed into \\"z\\", \\"c\\" and \\"s\\". *The Mandarin \\"r\\" is non-existent. It is replaced with a soft \\"z\\" sound. *\\"What\\", (什么 Shénma), is generally pronounced \\"seng\\", or \\"sheng\\" by local people. *Na- li, the expression for \\"over there\\" is often pronounced \\"na-ha-r\\". Variation The dialect spoken in Wuchuan County, about 60 km north of the city, has a recognizably different flavour. The same applies to the dialect in Siziwang Banner. The dialect around Tumed Left Banner, west of the city, is significantly different phonologically, but lexically similar. In Zhangjiakou, Hebei, however, the dialect seems relatively similar and has little variation.

He later became a canon of Mainz Cathedral and later also of Trier Cathedral. Christoph Nebel was ordained as a priest in Mainz on June 3, 1731. On September 9, 1732, the cathedral chapter of Mainz Cathedral chose him to be Archbishop of Mainz. Pope Clement XII confirmed this appointment on September 3, 1732. Archbishop of Trier Franz Georg von Schönborn consecrated Philipp Karl von Eltz-Kempenich as a bishop on November 16, 1732. In 1733, shortly after he became archbishop, the War of the Polish Succession began, pitting the Kingdom of France against the Habsburg Monarchy. Philipp Karl von Eltz- Kempenich allied the Archbishopric of Mainz with the Habsburgs in this conflict. The majority of fighting in this conflict took place in the Rhineland, leading the archbishop reluctantly to order the fortification of Mainz. He acquired Vukovar in 1736, and went on to order the construction of Eltz Manor.

Bayliss joined the club as chief scout in 1931 under his predecessor Harry Storer, Jr. Career Bayliss was from Alfreton, Derbyshire. He had an undistinguished career as a player making only a handful of appearances in the late 1920s for Luton, Mansfield and Southend. It was as a scout, however, that Bayliss made his name. He was considered an excellent judge of a player and focussed heavily on bringing young talent up through the youth and reserve teams: \\"One of the most knowledgeable men in football, Mr. Bayliss was just as popular. He was known in the boardroom of every club in Great Britain and he was practically an automatic choice for the managership of Coventry City\\" when Harry Storer, Jr. left for Birmingham City F.C. His spell as manager came at a difficult time, following the end of the Second World War, and he struggled to manoeuvre in the transfer market. Bayliss was popular with the playing staff, a number of whom maintained a bedside vigil in the weeks leading up to his death in April 1947. Although Bayliss had little time to develop his own team he laid down solid foundations for future managers by developing the youth squad. He died at his home in Coventry at age 47, survived by his wife, Ethel.
