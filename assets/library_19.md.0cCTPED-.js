He is celebrated as a pioneer of Franco-Proven√ßal grammar and lexicography, identifying a vocabulary for a set of dialects that had hitherto very largely been transmitted only orally. He is also considered the principal poet of the Aosta Valley, where he lived for most of his life, being a Savoyard in his youth before becoming an Italian. Life Cerlogne was born in the hamlet with which he shared his surname, in the comune of Saint-Nicolas, a mountain village several kilometers west of Aosta. His father, Jean-Michel Cerlogne, was a veteran of the Napoleonic Wars who worked as the village school master. While still a child, Cerlogne had to leave the family home to support himself as a shepherd. This was normal for boys of his age, as was his moving away from home to find work, becoming a chimney sweep in Marseilles. He returned briefly to the Aosta Valley in 1841, and this time when he went back to Marseilles he obtained a job at the \\"H√¥tel des Princes\\" where he worked as a scullion in the kitchens. A few years later, he had risen to the rank of kitchen assistant, which meant that when he next returned to his home valley, in 1845, he had a \\"trade\\". Still only 19, he now resumed his attendance at the local school for a couple of years. On 4 January 1847 he left the valley again, this time to enlist as a soldier for King Charles Albert. He participated in the First Italian War of Independence, taking part in the Battles of Goito and Santa Lucia. He was captured by the Austrians and briefly held as a prisoner of war, before being released on 7 September 1848. In his autobiography he later took care to stress the humanity with which, as a prisoner, he was treated by the Austrian army. After the Battle of Novara (23 March 1849) the war spluttered to an end, and he was sent on indefinite leave: he returned to Saint-Nicolas where, despite his age, he resumed his habit of attending the village school as a pupil, alongside the children. It turned out that word had got out concerning his experience in the hotel kitchens in Marseilles. He was effectively head- hunted to take on the catering at the principal seminary in Aosta, where he started work in September 1851. It was while working at the seminary that, encouraged by a senior seminarian, Canon √âdouard B√©rard, he composed his first poems (in French). Initially he continued to live at home in Saint-Nicolas, but in August 1854, following the death of the seminary superintendent, he became concerned that he might be about to lose his job, and took the opportunity to move into the seminary. After the death of his mother the following year he temporarily returned to Saint-Nicolas, but in August 1855 he was invited to return and resume his culinary duties at the seminary. In 1855, possibly as a test, B√©rard invited Cerlogne to compose a poem in the Vald√¥tain patois on the subject of the Prodigal Son. He duly set about writing, in two weeks, L'Infan prodeuggo; the first known poem written in the dialect. The poem was read out in the presence of the Bishop of Aosta, Andr√© Jourdain. The same year, before Christmas, Cerlogne wrote a second poem, entitled La ma√®nda √† Ts√©salet ('Dinner at Chesallet'); the bishop declared that Cerlogne's abilities were wasted in the kitchen ('Ce gar√ßon-l√† devrait avoir du talent pour autre chose que pour faire la cuisine. Il faut le faire √©tudier.') and committed to fund his further study personally. On 16 August 1856, Cerlogne left his job in the seminary kitchen and started to study with Father Basile Guichardaz, the priest at Saint-Nicolas, even though it quickly became apparent that Cerlogne's interest in poetry did not readily extend to an interest in the Latin grammar which was a required topic. He nevertheless returned to the seminary on 15 October 1859, but now, aged 33, he entered not as the cook but as a seminarian (trainee priest). In 1861, he composed the best known of his Vald√¥tain poems, 'La Pastorala', published in 1884, and still the Christmas song of choice in the Aosta Valley. In 1862, he also produced a French version, 'La Pastorale'. Soon after becoming a seminarian, he became aware of his vocation and, after some years of preparation, he became a country priest. Cerlogne celebrated his first mass at Saint-Nicolas on 22 December 1864. This was the start of a new life, during which he served in a succession of parishes. On 1 February 1865, he was appointed deacon at Valgrisenche, where he would recall wryly that the holy water in the church remained frozen for five months, and where he translated the papal bull \\"Ineffabilis Deus\\" (on the Immaculate Conception) into patois. Towards the end of September 1866, he was transferred to Pontboset, where he was awarded a medal of civil merit in recognition of the help he gave the people during the cholera epidemic of 1867. In a single month, he delivered help to 150 sick parishioners and buried 63 dead ones. The next year he composed the 'hymn', 'Les petits chinois' ('The Little Chinamen'), to be set to the melody of a regionally well-known folk tune. On 19 November 1870 he was given charge of his own parish, sent to take on Champdepraz, a small agricultural mountain parish in the eastern part of the Aosta Valley region. He now sought to clear the plot he had purchased to try his hand at viticulture. Neighbours subsequently followed his example, as a result of which, during the closing decades of the nineteenth century, vineyards came to dominate the hills of the comune. In October 1879, by now somewhat fatigued by nine years of parish responsibilities and viticulture, Cerlogne an invitation to live in the priory-rectory at Ayas. For the next four years he was able to use \\"the solitude of his room for scholarship\\". He used the opportunity to prepare material for his Dictionary and Grammar Book of the Vald√¥tain patois. In 1883 he returned to his parish at Champdepraz, where during the next few years he returned to poetry, producing \\"Lo Tsemin de Fer\\" (\\"The Railway\\" 1886), \\"Le s-ou et le dove com√©re\\" (\\"The Eggs and the Two Gossips\\"), \\"A do dzovenno epaou\\" (\\"To a Young Couple\\") and \\"la Pastorala di R√®i\\" (Pastorale of the Three Kings 1888). In 1889 he took on another parish, at Gressoney-Saint-Jean, and in 1891 he moved again, this time to the parish at Barbania, in the region of Piedmont (and therefore just outside the Aosta Valley), where the winters were less severe. Here he published two volume of a \\"village almanac\\" (\\"L'Armanaque di Velladzo\\"), which in its 1893 edition included his \\"Tsanson de Carnaval\\" (\\"Carnival Song\\"). It was also on 1893 that he published his \\"Petite grammaire du dialecte vald√¥tain\\", the work on Vald√¥tain grammar which had occupied him for many years. He was transferred again on 30 October 1894, this time to the parish of Pessinetto, where in January 1896 he published a new version of his \\"Tsanson de Carnaval\\" (\\"Carnival Song\\"), inspired as before ‚Äì but more obviously ‚Äì by social injustice and the gulf between rich and poor. The antepenultimate stanza also touches on the theme of economic emigration in search of work, a long running theme in much of Italy during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In July 1896 he was moved to Cantoira for eight months before moving on again to Corio, where in 1898 he wrote \\" Cinquanti√©mo annivers√©ro de 48\\", celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of 1848. On 12 March 1899 he arrived back in Champdepraz in the Aosta Valley. Although he expressed his joy at being back in the land of his birth, one more posting in Piedmont ensued, when he was transferred on 26 August 1899 to Canale d‚ÄôAlba, where he remained till 12 May 1901 (or 1900). After this he was able to live out his years in the Aosta Valley, taking charge at the parish of Vieyes, a hamlet at Aymavilles in the western part of the Aosta Valley where he composed several poems to celebrate the inauguration on 22 July 1901 at Courmayeur of the \\"Abb√© Henry\\" Botanical Garden. On 10 September 1902 the king appointed him a knight of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus. The award was not unexpected. Cerlogne's writings had long reflected a deep respect for the kings of Italy, to whom several of his works had been dedicated, such as his 1890 poem \\"To her Majesty, the Queen of Italy\\" (\\"√Ä Sa Majest√© la Reine d'Italie\\"), dedicated to Queen Margherita, for which he revisited his memories from his time serving in the army of King Charles Albert during the First Italian War of Independence. He was back in Piedmont in 1903, this time as a patient at the Ophthalmic Hospital in Turin for the removal of cataracts ‚Äì a more protracted operation then than subsequently. The operation was a success and he was directed by the doctor responsible to wear glasses to protect his vision for the future. He did this, but not for very long, and his vision deteriorated again. Commenting on his resulting predicament Cerlogne later commented that his friend, the Abb√© Henry, \\"loaned him his eyes\\" for the publication (in 1907) of his Vald√¥tain dictionary. Later that year, on 30 November 1903, he moved into the Saint-Jacqu√™me priory, a retirement home in Saint-Pierre for Val d'Aostan priests. He continued to work, authoring \\"Le patois vald√¥tain\\" which included \\"La fenna consolaye\\", a song which, according to Cerlogne, the oldest people in the local villages had already learned long ago from their grandmothers. On 6 March 1908 he quit the priory and went to live at the home of the poet Marius Thomasset at Villeneuve, working almost to the end on the linguistic development of the Vald√¥tain patois. Towards the end he moved on again, now to the presbytery at Saint-Nicolas. Here, on 7 October 1910, he died.  Heritage  Each year an event called \\"Concours Cerlogne\\", during which all Aostan primary schools, together with other schools coming from all over Franco- proven√ßal area, gather and participate with theatre plays or songs in patois, is organized in a different municipality of the Aosta Valley.

It is believed that the phenomenon was started by students at a high school in Jacksonville, Florida. The initial posting has inspired works by other groups, especially professional athletes and sports teams, who have posted increasingly complex and elaborate videos. News outlets have compared the videos to bullet time scenes from science fiction films such as The Matrix, X-Men: Days of Future Past, X-Men: Apocalypse, Lost in Space or Buffalo '66. Meanwhile, the participatory nature of the challenge on social media makes it similar to memes such as Makankosappo or the Harlem Shake. Others have noted similarities with the HBO TV series Westworld, which debuted around the same time, where robotic hosts can be stopped in their tracks.

Academy Street School was established in 1954 as a primary school within the Bayport School District, and Bayport School became Bayport High School. In 1959, a merger of the two districts was announced. It resulted in Bayport High School being expanded and renamed Bayport-Blue Point High School, and Academy Street and Blue Point both becoming elementary schools. The merger was completed in 1961, forming Bayport-Blue Point Union- Free School District. The district continued to expand, opening Sylvan Avenue Elementary School in 1965, and James Wilson Young Middle School in 1975. 2003 Bond Referendum During the 2002‚Äì2003 school year, Bayport-Blue Point School District passed a $35.5 million bond referendum giving improvements to schools across the district.

History It was established by the District Councils Act 1887, which took effect from 5 January 1888. It comprised the former District Council of Green's Plains, which amalgamated into the new council, and the areas of the cadastral Hundreds of Moonta and Wallaroo not contained in the Corporate Town of Kadina, Corporate Town of Moonta or the Corporate Town of Wallaroo. There had earlier been a serious attempt by Kadina residents to establish a Kadina council in 1866-1867, prior to the creation of the Corporate Town of Kadina, but it had been defeated by Wallaroo residents and the owners of the Wallaroo Mines. The council first met in the town of Paskeville, but the Paskeville Ward was severed from the council and added to the District Council of Kulpara on 1 July 1890. It operated out of offices in the Kadina Town Hall from 1889 until 1916, when it purchased a former shop on the corner of Digby Street and Taylor Street in Kadina and converted it to council chambers. The council had made frequent complaints in the early 1900s about being continually ignored in favour of the three corporate towns in the area (Kadina, Moonta and Wallaroo), and being excluded from important meetings. The Kadina council regained the Paskeville area on 12 May 1932 when the Kulpara council was abolished. In June 1932, it lost portions of Moonta Bay, North Moonta and Port Hughes to the Corporate Town of Moonta. In 1936, it was responsible for an area of 155,200 acres with a capital value of ¬£606,580. The council opened new chambers on 23 October 1959. The Corporate Town of Kadina had shown interest in amalgamation with surrounding municipalities, particularly the District Council of Kadina, as early as 1968. The development of the Kadina township had reached the limits of the municipal boundaries, and the historical Kadina suburbs of Jerusalem, Jericho, New Town and Wallaroo Mines were all across the boundary in the District Council of Kadina. The District Council declined attempts at amalgamation in 1970 and 1972, but changed its stance in 1976 after the town council instead sought to annex the surrounding suburbs. As a result, the Corporate Town of Kadina merged into the District Council of Kadina in 1977. The District Council ceased to exist on 1 July 1984 when it amalgamated with the Corporate Town of Moonta to form the District Council of Northern Yorke Peninsula.

It has smooth creamy brown and pale grey bark, narrow-lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven or nine, creamy-white flowers and barrel-shaped fruit.budsfoliage and flowersfruit Description Eucalyptus discreta is a shrub or mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. The bark is smooth creamy brown and pale grey, often with coarse ribbons of loose bark toward the base of the stem. Young plants and coppice regrowth have dull green, linear to narrow oblong leaves that are long, wide and arranged in opposite pairs. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same slightly glossy green on both sides, narrow lance-shaped to elliptic or curved, long, wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are borne in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval, long, wide, usually with a hemispherical operculum that is up to the same length as the floral cup. Flowering occurs between January and April and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody, shortly barrel- shaped fruit long and wide, with the valves at about the level of the rim. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus discreta was first formally described by the botanist Ian Brooker in 1979 in the journal Brunonia. The type specimen was collected by Brooker in 1974 about east of Esperance and the specific epithet (discreta) is a Latin word meaning \\"separated\\" referring to the juvenile leaves. This species is part of the Eucalyptus subgenus Symphyomyrtus in the section Bisectae and the subsection Destitutae. It is closely related to E. uncinata in which the juvenile leaves are joined at the base. Distribution and habitat This mallee grows in open shrubland on flats in coastal areas in the Goldfields-Esperance region between Ravensthorpe and the Nullarbor Plain in sandy-loamy soils usually over limestone or granite. Conservation status Eucalyptus discreta is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

History The council was proclaimed on 31 July 1872, following a 200-strong public meeting in May and subsequent petition to the government. The boundaries of the municipality were defined as Eliza Terrace, Julia Terrace, Lindsay Terrace, Doswell Terrace, Sophia Terrace, Cameron Terrace and Frances Terrace. It was divided into four wards at its inception: Elder Ward, Hughes Ward, Stirling Ward and Taylor Ward. The proclamation named Thomas Herne Hall as the first mayor, and Thomas Cornish and James Martin (Elder), R. W. Bawden and R. S. Haddy (Hughes), Thomas Tregoweth and John Rundle (Stirling) and William Harris and John Tonkin (Taylor) as the first councillors. The council meetings were initially held in Hall's store. In 1883, the new council conducted a beautification scheme in what was to become Victoria Square, replacing the \\"veritable eyesore\\" that had existed beforehand. The council acquired the Kadina Institute in 1889 after the institute committee had struggled to make repayments on a loan for the 1883 addition of a hall; the building then became the Kadina Town Hall. On 23 June 1908, the council became the first municipality in South Australia to be powered by its own electric lighting plant. On 3 May 1917, it annexed the adjacent area of Kadina South, a residential area south of the railway land that had until then been controlled by the District Council of Kadina and thus lacked town council municipal services. In May 1932, it assumed control of the Kadina Cemetery from the former board of trustees. In 1936, it was responsible for an area of 1,030 acres with a capital value of ¬£542,880. The council would remain responsible for electricity in the town until the 1950s, when the town plant was taken over by the Electricity Trust of South Australia. By 1968, there was support for amalgamation with the surrounding municipalities, as the development of the town had reached the limits of the municipal boundaries, and the historical Kadina suburbs of Jerusalem, Jericho, New Town and Wallaroo Mines were all across the boundary in the District Council of Kadina, which wholly surrounded the town. Merger discussions in 1969, 1970 and 1972 were unsuccessful, but after the town council attempted to annex the surrounding suburbs instead, an agreement was reached to amalgamate the two Kadina councils in September 1876. The council held its last meeting on 4 April 1977 before merging into the District Council of Kadina. MayorsReferences Kadina ","title":"Corporate Town of Kadina"},{"id":"52189080","text":"Pinera station tragedy V&SAR; Intercolonial Express Carriages were carriages on a new train called the Intercolonial Express running on Victorian Railways and South Australian Railways in 1887. The track of two railwys met on Wednesday 19 January 1887. The Victorian Railways' Western Line to Dimboola, and the South Australian Railways' Wolseley line, met at Serviceton. Since both sides shared the broad gauge of 5'3\\", an agreement was made between the two railways allowing a pool of carriages, classed O, to be specifically allocated to interstate trains linking the capitals of Melbourne and Adelaide. The operating and maintenance cost of the new train would be funded by both railways, roughly 60% paid for by the Victorian Railways and 40% by the South Australian Railways. A new fleet of carriages was built for the train and classed as the letter O. Four sleeping cars were imported from the United States and delivered in 1886 (as 1O-4O). They were joined by eight composite sitting cars (5O-12O) and a variety of guards and mail vans (13O-22O) built by both the Victorian and South Australian Railway's workshops, and all delivered for service in 1887. As patronage grew, additional carriages were added to the fleet, replicating earlier designs for fleet interchangeability. Vans 23O and 24O were built in 1890 to the same design as 15O and 16O; sitting cars 25-28O matched 5O-12O and entered service between 1897 and 1891; and 29O and 30O matched the designs of the initial sleeping cars, 1O-4O. The sitting cars became the most worn of the fleet, so in 1900 Victoria and South Australia each provided six sitting passenger carriages from their newest fleets, and the O cars 5-12 and 25-28 were removed from interstate service and split half each way, becoming the Victorian Railways' 77-82ABAB and the South Australian Railways' no.233-238. A new custom fleet was constructed from 1907, using the design of the E type carriage of the Victorian Railways. When that was completed the remaining O type carriages were withdrawn and split equally. Design The O cars were generally built to the existing most up-to-date designs of the respective railways, aside from the custom-ordered sleeping carriages. Construction Most of the O type carriages were built at either Newport or Islington workshops, to pre-agreed designs. The initial sleeping cars were imported complete, and the final pair were imported as kits and constructed locally. Operations The initial fleet provided four sleeping cars, eight sitting cars, four guard's vans, three post office vans and three baggage/mail vans, so it is reasonable to assume that the typical Intercolonial Express consist would have included one sleeping, two sitting, one post office car, one baggage/mail car and one guard's van, providing one consist for each direction. A spare of each type would be rostered in maintenance, and the fourth sleeping, fourth guard's van and seventh and eighth sitting cars would be kept spare, available for swapping out of a consist on short notice. In the event of a post office or baggage/mail car being unavailable one from the standard VR or SAR fleet could be substituted as a temporary replacement. After a few years of operation, two additional guard's vans, four sitting and two sleeping cars were added to the fleet. These would have allowed a consist of two sleeping, four sitting and four vans, including one acting as the guard's van. It is possible that one guard's van may have been placed at either end of the train, to provide some degree of noise insulation and simplify shunting movements at either end to and from the yards. Fleet Details=Mann cars (1-4O, 29O, 30O) In 1886, delivery was taken of four sleeping carriages built by the Mann Boudoir Car Company of New York. The first two, 1O and 2O, were delivered on 22 October 1886, and 3O and 4O entered service on 24 December of the same year. The cars had twenty berths attached to a corridor, with exposed end-platform diaphragms. Additional cars 29O and 30O entered service on 30 October 1889, identical to their predecessors. It is possible that 29O was constructed at Newport Workshops, having been delivered as a kit of parts. In 1907 the E type carriage sleepers were entering service and these sleepers were rendered obsolete, so the O fleet was split roughly equally between the two railways. In March 1908 the Mann Boudoir cars were reallocated; 1O and 4O went to the South Australian Railways; the pair were issued numbered 116 and 117 in the SAR fleet, while 2O and 3O became Sleeper No.6 and Mildura in the Victorian Railways' fleet. 29O and 30O were retained in Joint Stock service until further E type sleeping cars had been delivered, but they were allocated names Latrobe and Hindmarsh respectively. =South Australian Railways= Cars 116 and 117 entered SAR-exclusive service in 1908. 116 was fitted with electric lighting, and one end was altered to an observation car profile for departmental inspection tours, in 1909. It was renamed Willochra in 1910 and retained in that service until 1933 when it was officially condemned, though reports exist of it having been part of the 1934 Royal Tour Pilot Train. The car was sold to Rofe and Co in 1935. 117 was named Broughton in 1911, and altered like Willochra as an observation car in 1913 (presumably including fitting of electric lighting). In April 1930 it was converted to State (ViceRegal) Car No.1, and it was retained in that capacity until 1940 when it was withdrawn and sold to W.Brown and Sons Ltd. It ended its days as a house boat at Goolwa. Eventually it fell into disrepair and was broken up about 1974. Hindmarsh was allocated to the SAR in 1920, and it is known that it was used on that railway's Renmark Express service during 1927-1929. The car was recorded as scrapped in 1933, but it had been used as part of the 1934 Royal Tour (Duke of Gloucester)'s Pilot Train between Tarlee and Adelaide. Carriage no. 118 had long-since been allocated to a different vehicle, so the car kept its name as the only identity. It is thought that the vehicle was sold and moved to a property somewhere in the Two Wells - Virginia region. =Victorian Railways= By August 1908 Mildura had been rebuilt with fourteen berths removed and replaced with a kitchen and dining area, and renamed Kiewa.http://pjv101.net/fts/u01/ae134.gif Sleeper No.6 followed in 1911 with the same conversions made, and it was named Avon. Externally the cars were still marked as first-class sleepers, with no reference to the kitchens.http://pjv101.net/fts/u01/aa052.jpg Latrobe was given to the VR in 1920, but no records exist of any conversion away from the sleeping car configuration. Kiewa and Latrobe were withdrawn in 1929, and Avon in 1932. Mansard Roof Composite Sitting (5-12, 25-28O) From 17 January 1887, a small fleet of composite 1st/2nd sitting carriages were built by the Victorian Railways' locomotive and carriage department, and allocated to the Intercolonial Express. Cars were given identities 5O through 12O, as numbers 1-4 had been taken by the Mann sleepers. The cars were of a side-loading type, 44ft1in long and with capacity for 32 1st and 20 2nd class passengers. A later delivery added numbers 25-28 to the fleet, with these vehicles entering service over the course of 1889-1891. Again, all were built at Newport, with the exception of number 25 which had been constructed at the South Australian Railways' equivalent. When the cars were superseded by the OA/OB fleet in 1900, half the cars (6-8, 10, 11, 25) went to the South Australian Railways as numbers 233-238, and the rest (5, 9, 12, 28, 26, 27) went to the Victorian Railways as cars 77-82 ABAB.http://pjv101.net/cd/pages/c374d.htm =South Australian Railways= The South Australian carriages were converted in 1929 to sit 60 2nd class passengers, and most were scrapped in 1938 (233 in 1936; 238 in 1953). =Victorian Railways= The Victorian carriages were renumbered again in the 1910 recoding, to occupy the range 75-80AB. In the 1950s 75-77AB were converted to temporary Way and Works crew sleeper cars; 75 and 77AB were scrapped in 1956 with bodies last seen in Alberton, Victoria in that year, but they were both gone by 1995 when the area was developed for housing. 76AB was formally converted to workmen's sleeper 77WW in 1959, and retained in service until 1976 when it was stored at Newport Workshops; it was then marked Off Register at some point in 1977. 78, 79 and 80AB were extended in 1911-13 with frame splicing to bring the total length to 57' 3\\" over body. 78AB then remained in service until conversion to 57WW in 1958, and withdrawal in 1978. 79AB became 108B, then with electrification it was converted to Swing-door (dogbox) trailer carriage 100BT. In 1923 it was altered to 126T, and it was scrapped with that identity in 1964. 80AB became 32BC with a guard compartment, then 9BCD in 1921 and 22D in 1924. It was marked scrapped in 1962. Mansard Roof Centre Cupola Guard's Vans (13O, 14O) Two composite passenger and guard/brakevans were built by Newport Workshops and dedicated to the Intercolonial Express in 1887. They were allocated the identities 13O and 14O. The vans comprised a long goods and passenger compartment, with a guard's raised observation cupola in the centre. The guard had both a handbrake and a direct connection to the Westinghouse Air Brake pipe for the whole train. In 1908 they were removed from Joint Stock service. 13O went to the VR as 46DD, while 14O became No.7 with the SAR. =South Australian Railways= Not much detail is available on the post-Joint Stock life of brake van 7. =Victorian Railways= The VR accepted 13O onto their books in 1908, and allocated it the new identity 46DD. In the 1910 recoding that was changed to 44C. It was fitted with high-speed bogies of the TT30 type in 1958 at Newport Workshops, and retained in service until withdrawn in 1983. The body was sold to the Sunraysia Area Scouts at Lake Cullulleraine near Mildura, and it was last spotted by Bruce McLean at Lake Cullulleraine in 1991.http://pjv101.net/cd/pages/c206d.htm Mansard Roof End Cupola Guard's Vans (15O, 16O, 23O, 24O) A further four composite passenger and guard/brakevans were constructed by the South Australian Railways for use on the Intercolonial Express; 15O and 16O in 1887, and 23O, 24O in 1890. These vans comprised a long goods and passenger compartment, with a guard's raised observation cupola at one end.http://pjv101.net/fts/u01/ad613.jpghttp://pjv101.net/fts/u01/ac578.jpg The guard had both a handbrake and a direct connection to the Westinghouse Air Brake pipe for the whole train. In 1895 the vans were marked as modified with a fish compartment; this would likely have been a small, iced, locked compartment under the floorboards of part of the van between the bogies. In 1908 they were removed from Joint Stock service. 23O and 24O became No.58 and 68 with the SAR, while the other two became the VR's 47 and 48DD. =South Australian Railways= Not much detail is available on the post-Joint Stock lives of brake van 58. However, it is known that No.58 was later converted to a weighbridge wagon (fixed at a certain weight for calibration purposes). Van 68, on the other hand, was modified in 1919 with the guard compartment shifted to the centre of the van, requiring removal of the fish compartment. In 1930 the van was altered for use as a railcar trailer, and in 1941 the fish compartment was restored. Finally, in 1953, the van was condemned. =Victorian Railways= The VR accepted 15O and 16O onto their books in 1908, and allocated them new identities 47‚Äì48DD. In the 1910 recoding they were given new identities 45C and 46C respectively. 45C was withdrawn in 1954, and 46C was withdrawn in 1938. Mansard Roof Mail Vans (17-22O) In the days before electronic communication, hand-written letters were the only method of long-distance communication. As a result, there were massive amounts of mail traffic on a daily basis between the South Australian and Victorian capital cities, from which the mail would be distributed all around the states. To meet this demand, the South Australian Railways built six mail- sorting vans for use on the Intercolonial Express, all entering service in 1887 with identities 17O through 22O. The vans were staffed with post office employees, who loaded mail bags at the start of the trip (and at intermediate stops) and spent the entire travel time sorting letters for delivery en route and at the terminus. Unlike all the other classes from the O series, the divide was uneven in 1908 with two - 18 and 19O - sent to South Australia as numbers 258 and 259; the other four were all given to the Victorian Railways. 17O became the VR's 3EES, retaining its mail-sorting facilities. The remaining three vans, 20O, 21O and 22O, had their SAR ownership share purchased by the VR in 1904, and they were withdrawn from Joint Stock service and rebuilt as WS workmen vans 9, 10 and 11. =South Australian Railways= 18 and 19O were sent to the South Australian Railways in 1908 and allocated numbers 258 and 259. In 1916, 258 was modified to become the Officers Inspection Car, Murray. In 1934 the name was changed to Willochra, after the first (ex No.1O) was withdrawn. In 1966 the van was condemned and sold to Mr Nicholls of Jabuk, who eventually sold it to Old Tailem Bend Town Historic village. It was moved to Port Dock Station Railway Museum in 1991. 259 was spotted in use as a locomotive crew sleeping van in 1918, and it was withdrawn from service around 1936. =Victorian Railways= 17O became 3EES in 1908 then 3DS in 1910, following the recoding of the then-new E type carriages. In 1922 it was rebuilt as a workmen's sleeper no. 4WW, and in 1938 it was scrapped. 20O, 21O and 22O became Victorian Railways property in 1904, and they were rebuilt as WS vans 9, 10 and 11. This group of workmen's sleepers was supposed to be restricted to four-wheel wagons, so in 1910 they were recoded 1-3WW. 1WW was scrapped in 1931; 2WW in 1934 and 3WW in 1929. 1900 fleet boost - 31-42 OA, OB By 1900, some of the original O-type carriages were no longer the best of either railways' fleet, so both the Victorian and South Australian Railways volunteered six carriages each from their regular fleet, as temporary members of the O series. All cars were returned to their original identities and allocations in late 1908. =Joint-Stock V type carriages (31-36 OA & OB)= The vehicles provided by the VR were 1898-1900 built V type carriages 21AV, 26AV, 23BV, 5AV, 11AV and 6BV, taking numbers 31-36 and codes OA for first class and OB for second. However, there is no evidence that the new codes were marked externally. =Joint-Stock SAR carriages (37-39OA, 40-42OB)= The vehicles provided by the SAR had been built at the Islington workshops. 181, 182 and 183 were built in 1892 as 44ft1in side-loading coaches with accommodation for 48 1st class passengers, and they became 37-39OA. 192, 193 and 196 were from an 1899 batch, with room for 54 2nd class passengers. Only the latter three had internal toilet compartments. Introduction of E type carriages The first E type carriages ran in late 1906 on the Melbourne- Albury run, but by 1908 enough had been constructed to boost, and later replace, the entire Joint Stock fleet then running between Melbourne and Adelaide. By 1910, 24 cars had been delivered into Joint Stock service - six each 1st (AE) and 2nd (BE) class sitting cars four Sleeping cars named Melbourne, Ballaarat, Wolseley and Adelaide (later renamed), four CE guard vans, and two each mail storage (EEB) and mail sorting (EES) vans. The SAR built 9 of the cars plus one underframe at Islington Workshops to cover 40% of the construction cost (as agreed between the SAR and VR commissioners), though the body of this tenth car was constructed at Newport. Details of further deliveries of E type carriages can be found on that page.

It has smooth greyish bark that is shed in strips, glossy green, narrow elliptic to narrow lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between seven and eleven, creamy white flowers and short cylindrical to stubby barrel-shaped fruit.flower budsfruit Description Eucalyptus dissimulata is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth light grey to greenish brown bark that is shed in strips. Young plants and coppice regrowth have sessile leaves arranged in opposite pairs and long and wide. Adult leaves are glossy green, arranged alternately, narrow elliptic to narrow lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven, nine or eleven, the groups on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval to diamond shaped, long and wide with a conical operculum long. Flowering occurs between October and March and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody, shortly cylindrical or stubby barrel-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed below the rim. The seeds are brown-grey and a flattened oval shape. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus dissimulata was first formally described by the botanist Ian Brooker in 1988 in the journal Nuytsia from a specimen he collected in 1984 about north of Needilup. The specific epithet (dissimulata) is a Latin word meaning \\"pretending\\", referring to the superficial similarity of this species to E. albida. This species is part of the Eucalyptus subgenus Symphyomyrtus in the section Bisectae and the subsection Destitutae. Distribution and habitat Red-capped mallee is found on sand-plains and near creeks, along a narrow, near-coastal strip in the Wheatbelt and Goldfields-Esperance regions between Corrigin and Munglinup where it grows in sandy-loamy soils. Conservation status Eucalyptus dissimulata is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

In March 2015, following a series of corruption scandals, President Bachelet appointed Engel President of the Presidential Advisory Council on Conflicts of Interest, Influence Peddling, and Corruption ‚Äì known as the Engel Commission. In only 45 days, this non-partisan commission composed of 16 members produced a comprehensive set of over 200 reform proposals covering 21 thematic areas. After the report was presented to President Bachelet and the council completed its mandate, Engel became a firm advocate for the reforms to materialize. He created Espacio P√∫blico‚Äôs Anti-Corruption Observatory, a pioneering legislative monitoring initiative that employs a user-friendly online platform to assess the progress of the different proposals and triggers incidence actions to help them move forward. So far, this effort has translated into nine laws being passed in areas as diverse as political financing, anti-trust law and civic education His anti-corruption work has been praised both at home and abroad. In May 2016, in a poll by one of the major Chilean newspapers (La Segunda) Engel appeared as the country‚Äôs most admired public figure. Engel has been invited to present this work at public events in Washington, DC, Santa Cruz (Bolivia), Montevideo, Buenos Aires, Sao Paulo and Bogota.

Launch The Stop Funding Hate campaign was set up in August 2016 by Richard Wilson, a former Corporate Fundraising Officer at Amnesty International. The campaign gained over 70,000 likes on its Facebook page in the first three days of activity and the campaign's launch video was viewed over 6 million times. In February 2017 Stop Funding Hate launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds, finishing with ¬£102,721 raised. Campaigns The campaign has called on companies including Aldi, Asda, Barclays, British Airways, Co-op UK, Gillette, Iceland, John Lewis, Lego, Marks & Spencer, Morrisons, Virgin Media and Waitrose to stop advertising in newspapers such as The Sun, Daily Mail and Daily Express. Stop Funding Hate's first campaign, targeting Virgin Media, claimed that their values were \\"totally at odds with the Sun‚Äôs track record of misleading reporting\\", and was signed by over 40,000 people. Following their coverage of the high court's November ruling on Brexit, advertisers in the Daily Mail were targeted by the campaign and its supporters using the hashtag #StopFundingHate. In a Christmas campaign by Stop Funding Hate, the group released a mock advert in the style of John Lewis Christmas adverts, calling on the department store to stop advertising in certain newspapers. In August 2017, Stop Funding Hate undertook its first street campaign in conjunction with the social justice charity Citizens UK. The campaign targeted mobile network operators including BT Mobile, EE Limited, O2, Sky Mobile, Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile UK using the slogan \\"Start Spreading Love\\". Results In September 2016, Specsavers withdrew an advert from the Daily Express after hundreds, including Stop Funding Hate, complained that it was funding \\"fear and division\\". Gary Lineker showed support for the campaign, saying that he had spoken to Walkers about their advertisements in The Sun. Following calls from the campaign and its supporters, Lego announced in November 2016 that it was ending its advertising with the Daily Mail, stating they were \\"not planning any future promotional activity with the newspaper\\", making it the first company to end its advertising in one of the targeted newspapers since the campaign's inception. In February 2017 the internet service provider Plusnet withdrew adverts from The Sun and The Body Shop announced they had no future plans to advertise in The Daily Mail after social media criticism. In November 2017 Paperchase also announced that they would stop advertising in The Daily Mail, saying that they had \\"listened to customers\\". A campaign which targeted The Co-operative Group led to their chief executive Richard Pennycook saying in 2016 that they would be \\"looking at our advertising for next year to see whether we can align it more closely with our natural sources of support rather than more generic media advertising\\". However, in a 2017 update by Nick Crofts, President of the National Members‚Äô Council, it was stated that after investigation, \\"Many people buy these papers at the Co-op and some of them will be our members. Advertising in these papers also drives sales which are important to our businesses\\". Virgin Trains West Coast stopped selling The Daily Mail onboard the trains which it operates in conjunction with Stagecoach Group in November 2017. After criticisms that the move censored the newspapers that passengers could read, Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Rail Group, reinstated the paper in January 2018. Speaking in a statement on his own behalf and that of Stagecoach chairman Brian Souter, Branson said: \\"Brian and I agree that we must not ever be seen to be censoring what our customers read and influencing their freedom of choice. Nor must we be seen to be moralising on behalf of others. Instead we should stand up for the values we hold dear and defend them publicly, as I have done with the Mail on many issues over the years.\\" Finances In addition to the ¬£102,721 initially raised, a further crowdfunding campaign generated ¬£80,251 from supporters in January 2018. The campaign that finished in March 2019 raised ¬£5,067 against a target of ¬£45,000. Accounts filed at Companies House with a balance sheet date of 30 April 2018 showed that Stop Funding Hate had current assets of ¬£130,549 and owed ¬£130,549 to creditors. It had zero net assets and zero reserves. The Community Interest Company Report (CIC 34) filed with the annual accounts showed that the Stop Funding Hate board had been remunerated. Criticism Writing for the Press Gazette, Dominic Ponsford criticised Stop Funding Hate and its campaigners for encouraging people to influence the content of newspapers they don't read themselves, and raised concerns about advertisers influencing the content of newspapers. In a response to Ponsford's article, Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff argued that Ponsford did not consider the \\"total vacuum of responsibility within the journalism world when it comes to how our content is going to affect our audience\\". In Spiked, Naomi Firsht described the campaign as \\"entirely about censorship\\", arguing that consumers should simply not buy newspapers if they disagree with their content. Writing in The Spectator, Brendan O'Neill described the campaign \\"elitist, repugnant and illiberal, as are all attempts at press censorship\\". Stop Funding Hate responded to criticisms of censorship by saying that they \\"fully support freedom of choice & are not calling for any publication to be removed from sale\\". The Daily Mail, responding to Paperchase's decision to cease advertising with them, described Stop Funding Hate as \\"a small group of hard left Corbynist individuals seeking to suppress legitimate debate and impose their views on the media\\".

Between 65.5 and 80 percent of the urban area of Nagaoka was destroyed during the bombing. Background Nagaoka was a regional commercial centre and home to one of the laboratories of Japan's Institute of Physical and Chemical Research. As of 1945 it had a population of around 67,000. While local lore held that Nagaoka was targeted because it was the hometown of Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, who had directed the attack on Pearl Harbor, the presence of the chemical laboratory was more likely the reason the city was targeted. Air raids M-69 napalm incendiary bomb, that were used in bombing of Nagaoka in 1945. Exhibit at Niigata Prefectural Museum of History. Nagaoka was attacked for the first time on 26 July 1945. The city was one of ten to be attacked during late July by the United States Army Air Forces' 509th Composite Group to practice the tactics the unit later used to conduct the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These raids were conducted by small groups of two to six Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers armed with Pumpkin bombs. The 509th Composite Group assessed the results of the small attack on Nagaoka as having been \\"fair\\". During the night of 27/28 July B-29s dropped leaflets on Nagaoka and ten other cities which stated that they would be subjected to attack, and that civilians should evacuate ahead of the raids. This tactic sought to intensify the psychological effects of the bombing campaign. The main raid on Nagaoka occurred on 1 August 1945. Commencing at around 10:30 p.m. that night, 125 B-29 Superfortress bombers from the 313th Bombardment Wing struck the city with an estimated 163,000 incendiary bombs totaling 925 tons. The raid lasted for 1 hour and 40 minutes. The city suffered severe damage, though estimates of its extent vary: in 1953 the USAAF's official history stated that 65.5 percent of Nagaoka's urban area was destroyed, and this figure was also used by historian Richard B. Frank in 2001. However, in 2016 The Washington Post reported that 80 percent of Nagaoka had been burnt out. A total of 1,486 people were killed in Nagaoka, including more than 280 school age children. The American force that attacked Nagaoka did not suffer any casualties. The cities of Toyama, Mito and Hachioki were also attacked on the night of 1/2 August, and suffered severe damage. The New York Times reported that the raids that night had included the largest number of bombs dropped up to that time. Legacy In November 1951 a bronze statue was erected at the Nagaoka railway station to commemorate the bombing and its victims. Called Heiwa-zo (Statue of Peace), it depicts a goddess with outstretched arms, a little girl with a ball, and a boy reading a book. Hidden in the bosom of the goddess is a copper plate engraved with the names of the schoolchildren who died in the air raid. The statue was moved to the Peace Forest Memorial Park in 1996. Beginning in 2003, a fireworks display has been held annually on 1 August at 10:30 pm, the time the bombing occurred. Three shiragiku (white chrysanthemum fireworks) are launched \\"as an offering to the war dead\\". In 2015 the display featured an additional 2,000 fireworks.

The combatants were the Eastern Bolivian Guarani Indians (called Chiriguanos at that time) and a force made up of Bolivian military, militia, and Chiriguano Indians friendly to the government and Christianity. Often described as a massacre, the battle resulted in an overwhelming victory by the government forces. In the aftermath of the battle the government forces executed the Chiriguano leader, Apiaguaiki Tumpa or Hapiaoeki Tumpa, and many captives. The battle ended 400 years of conflict by the Chiriguanos against, first, the Inca Empire, secondly, the Spanish Empire, and finally, the independent country of Bolivia. Chiriguanos is the historical name, deriving from Quechua and Spanish, for the people who now prefer to be known as the Ava Guarani or simply Guarani. Background The Eastern Bolivian Guarani, popularly called Chiriguanos, were a warlike people who fought against the Inca Empire, its successor, the Spanish Empire, and Bolivia from 1520 or earlier until the Battle of Kuruyuki in 1892. They were mostly successful until the 1860s when a combination of encroachment on their lands by Spanish-speaking ranchers and settlers (creoles), antagonism between Christian and non-Christian Chiriguanos, and, possibly, demographic decline led to the defeat of Chiriguanos who wished to preserve their independence and rejected Christianity.Langer, Erick D. (2009), Expecting Pears from an Elm Tree, Durham: Duke University Press, pp. 11-18 The Chiriguanos, who may have numbered more than 100,000 in the 18th century, were never united and their fragmentation into factions weakened their capability of countering the increasing power and influence of Bolivian Creoles in the late 19th century.Langer, p. 15 y Chiriguano responses to the increasing stress on their society in the 19th century included the acceptance by many of Christianity and/or residence in the relatively safe, but regimented, environment of Franciscan missions‚Äîten of which were established between 1845 and 1891.Langer, pp. 52-53 Other Chiriguanos made their peace with creole ranchers and settlers or journeyed to Argentina for seasonal work in the sugar cane fields. By 1891, 11,000 Chriguanos, many of them non-Christians, lived in the missions and most of the rest were working on ranches in Bolivia and Argentina.Langer, pp. 47-56, 186-187 In 1889, however, a 28-year old Chiriguano man named Chapiaguasu began his career as a prophet and healer with a message of restoring the old order of Chiriguano society and expelling the creoles and missionaries from their lands. Chapiaguasu called himself Apiaguaiki Tumpa (the Eunuch of God) and the aims of the movement he led were similar to other contemporary millenarian movements around the world such as the Boxer Rebellion in China and the Ghost Dance in the United States.Hurtado Guzman, Emilio, \\"Apaiguaiqui Tumpa, la ultima esperanza de la liberation guarani-chiriguana frente al Estado republicano colonial,\\" Biblioteca Virtual, ; Adas, Michael (2012), Prophets of Rebellion: Mellenarian Protest Movements against the European Colonial Order, Chapel Hill:University of North Carolina Press, p. xix. The spark that ignited the war was the rape and murder of a young Chiriguano woman on January 1, 1892 by the corregidor (mayor) of the town of Cuevo, near the Santa Rosa Mission.Comb√©s, Isabelle, \\"Las batallas de Kuruyuki: Variaciones sobre una derrota chiriguana,\\" Bulletin de l'Institut Francais d'Etudes Andines, Vol. 34, No. 2, p. 223 On January 7 Chiriguanos ambushed a Bolivian army patrol, attacked creole ranches, and sacked Cuevo. On January 12 a contingent of soldiers, volunteers and Indian archers was defeated by the Chiriguano forces of Apiaguaiki. 3,000 Creoles and 2,000 Chiriguanos took refuge in the mission as protection against Apiaguaiki and his followers. On January 21, Apiaguaiki led a force of 1000 men on foot and 300 on horseback against the walls of Santa Rosa. Departing from the usual Chiriguano tactics of ambush and hit-and-run attacks, Apiaguaiki attempted a frontal attack on the mission for which the weapons of the Indians, primarily bows and arrows, were ineffective. The Chiriguano leader of the mission community, Mandeponay, turned against Apiaguaiki at the last moment and aided the mission's defenders. After suffering 40 dead, Apiaguaiki called off the attack and he and his followers, numbering about 5,000, entrenched themselves at the community of Kuruyuki northeast of the mission.Langer, pp. 190-192; Hurtado Guzman The battle In the days following the attack on the Santa Rosa Mission, the Creoles gathered reinforcements, including Indians from nearby missions and soldiers who arrived from Santa Cruz de la Sierra. On January 28, Bolivian army officers led a counter-attack with 50 soldiers, 140 creole militia (mostly armed with repeating rifles), and 1,500 Indians armed with bows and arrows. In the battle of Kuruyuki, the army killed more than 600 Chiriguanos with losses of their own of only four killed, all Indians. Following the battle, the army massacred Chiriguanos who surrendered and sold women and children into slavery. The 2,000 Chiriguanos resident at the Santa Rosa de Cuevo Mission mostly supported the army.Langer, pp. 186-195 The Chirguanos dispersed after the battle but the Bolivian army, creoles, and Indian allies pursued them and killed thousands more.

D.\\" Tuska (August 15, 1896 ‚Äì June 30, 1985) was an early radio experimenter and amateur operator, who also became one of the first radio receiver manufacturers. He is best known as the co-founder, along with Hiram Percy Maxim, of the American Radio Relay League (ARRL). He was also the original editor and owner of the amateur radio publication QST, which he subsequently sold to the ARRL in 1919, as part of his reorientation toward professional activities within the radio industry. Early life Tuska was born in New York city, the only child of Ida Anna Ruddell and David Tuska. He lived in Nyack, New York until 1909, when his family moved to Hartford, Connecticut.\\"The Early Years: Part 1 of 3\\" video from the AWA Museum (Bruce Kelly), uploaded May 6, 2010. (youtube.com) After graduating from high school, he attended the local Trinity College (class of 1919, although he did not receive his Bachelor of Science degree until 1939).\\"Clarence Denton Tuska\\" (obituary), Trinity Reporter, Winter 1986, page 47 (issuu.com) Amateur radio activities Tuska had an early interest in radio communication (then known as \\"wireless telegraphy\\") and experimentation. In 1908, while living in Nyack, a New York City cousin helped him construct a small radio transmitter, and after moving to Hartford the next year he constructed progressively more powerful stations. Radio transmitters in the United States were not licensed at this time, so he initially operated using the self-assigned call letters SNT, which stood for \\"Southern New England-Tuska\\". Around 1910, while in the ninth grade, Tuska began earning \\"pocket money\\" by selling rubber band-powered model aeroplanes on consignment through the Harris Parker Toy Store. After these sales started to decline, he next constructed a simple crystal radio receiver, also offered through consignment at the toy store. Inventor Hiram Percy Maxim took this set home to test, but soon returned it, and the store owner incorrectly informed Tuska that Maxim had said it \\"didn't work\\". This upset Tuska, so with a friend, William Ball, he traveled, unannounced, to Maxim's house to investigate. After clarifying that Maxim actually just needed better quality equipment, Tuska and Ball arranged for ordering the appropriate components, which were used to construct a set that \\"gave satisfactory service for a number of years\\". Both Maxim and Tuska became prominent local amateur radio enthusiasts, with the two forming an informal \\"father-foster-son relationship\\", as Tuska's father was deceased.\\"A Memorable Meeting\\" by C. D. Tuska, Fifty Years of ARRL, 1965, pages 5-6. After the United States enacted the Radio Act of 1912, all radio transmitters now were required to be licensed, and in early 1913 Tuska was issued a standard Amateur license with the call sign 1WD.The \\"1\\" in 1WD's call sign indicated that the station was located in the first Radio Inspection district. On January 14, 1914, local amateurs founded the Hartford Radio Club, and Tuska became the club's secretary. In the fall of 1915, he began teaching a radio principles class at the local Y.M.C.A.\\"Radio Apparatus for Y.M.C.A Boys\\", Hartford Courant, September 27, 1915, page 7. Tuska also began experimenting with radiotelephony, using an arc transmitter of his own design, which employed tungsten electrodes to make audio transmissions. In March 1916 it was reported that he was broadcasting semi-regular phonograph concerts, at a time when virtually all radio transmissions were still employing the dots-and-dashes of Morse code. Founding of the American Radio Relay League and QST magazine Announcement about the establishment of QST magazine that appeared in the debut December 1915 issue Under the provisions of the Radio Act of 1912, most amateur stations were restricted to operating on a wavelength of 200 meters (1500 kHz), which effectively limited their transmitting range to about 25 miles (40 kilometers). In the spring of 1914, Hiram Percy Maxim began promoting the idea of a national organization of amateurs that would transmit messages over greater distances by organizing relays. This resulted in Maxim's incorporation of the American Radio Relay League, with Maxim as president, and Tuska the organization's secretary. At this time Tuska also resigned from the Hartford Radio Club. Communications throughout the new league proved difficult, so Tuska suggested the establishment of a magazine to promote and coordinate the organization's activities, and, following advise from an uncle, founded QST magazine. Although QST acted as the official publication of the ARRL, initially the magazine was personally owned by Tuska, who became its first editor. The publication was prepared at his mother's house, with the first issue dated December 1915.\\"The Early Years: Part 2 of 3\\" video from the AWA Museum (Bruce Kelly), uploaded on May 6, 2010. (youtube.com) One of the provisions of the Radio Act of 1912 was that, in a limited number of cases where it was shown to be of value, amateurs could be issued \\"Special Amateur\\" licenses, that permitted operation in the band of wavelengths from 600 to 200 meters (500 to 1500 kHz). Maxim successfully convinced government regulators that relay work fell into this category, and in the spring of 1915 Tuska was upgraded to a Special Amateur license, with the call sign 1ZT, which permitted operation on the standard relay wavelength of 425 meters (706 kHz).\\"Special Land Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, May 1915, page 4. The \\"Z\\" in 1ZT's call sign reflected the fact that the station was operating under a Special Amateur license. World War One In April 1917, the entry of the United States into World War One resulted in all civilian radio stations being shut down for the duration of the conflict. Despite this, Tuska hoped to continue publishing QST, but with all amateur stations now silenced, and large numbers of their operators entering military service, this proved impossible. The magazine suspended publication after its September 1917 issue, and Tuska applied for and received a commission as a Lieutenant in the U.S. Army's Signal Corps.\\"Clarence D. Tuska: Radio Pioneer, ARRL Founder\\" by Bart Lee, K6VK, QST, July 2014, pages 67-68. Originally posted in Washington, D.C., he next established a radio training school at the Ellington Airfield near Houston, Texas. He was later transferred to the radio school at the Firing center at Camp McClellan in Alabama. After the end of the war, he returned to Hartford.\\"The Early Years: Part 3 of 3\\" video from the AWA Museum (Bruce Kelly), uploaded May 6, 2010. (youtube.com) Initial professional work In late 1919, the government ban on amateur radio stations was lifted, and Tuska was issued a standard amateur license with the call sign 1AY. However, as the family bread-winner ‚Äî in the 1920 U.S. census, he was listed as \\"head of household\\", living with his mother and grandmother Annie E. Ruddell, who were both widowed ‚Äî he became focused on earning a living, so he turned to the professional side of the radio industry. At the same time an effort was being made to revive the dormant ARRL, and an eight-page \\"midget issue\\" of QST was published in April 1919, where it was announced that $7,500 in 5% two-year bonds were being sold in order to restart the league. Approximately $4,700 of these funds were allocated for purchasing QST from Tuska and paying several months of outstanding printing fees. The fundraising proved successful, and monthly publication of QST resumed in June under the new ownership.200 Meters and Down: The Story of Amateur Radio by Clinton B. DeSoto, 1936, pages 53-57. C. D. Tuska Company In 1920, with Maxim's help, Tuska established the C. D. Tuska Company in Hartford. After an unsuccessful attempt to market an electrical experimenter's kit, he later began offering radio equipment, eventually manufacturing radio receivers for amateurs and experimenters. As part of this effort, he obtained a license to use the Armstrong regenerative circuit patent, which was an important advance in radio reception. Although Tuska's company initially was a minor concern oriented toward the relatively small amateur radio market, in 1922 a nationwide increase in the number of broadcasting stations caused an explosive growth in the radio industry. Moreover, although Tuska's Armstrong license only covered \\"amateur and experimental\\" offering (in contrast to the \\"commercial\\" rights held by Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company), a series of court rulings later clarified that radio receiver sales to the general public, for picking up broadcasting stations, was included as part of the \\"amateur and experimental\\" rights.Radio Manufacturers of the 1920s (Volume 3) by Alan Douglas, 1991, C. D. Tuska section, pages 200-203. As a result of rapidly expanding demand, in late March 1922 it was announced that there were plans to increase the company work staff from 35 to 125 persons.\\"Will Rush Completion of Wireless Station\\", Hartford Courant, March 27, 1922, page 1. By early June, it became necessary to move into an even larger factory, with the staff now numbering 175.\\"Remarkable Expansion of C. D. Tuska Business Due to Radio Popularity\\", Hartford Courant, June 5, 1922, page 10. In 1923 Tuska, in conjunction with Robert Miner, developed a modification of the original regeneration circuit, which was called the \\"Superdyne\\".\\"The Superdyne Receiver\\", Radio Age, February 1924, pages 25-26.\\"Not Often Remembered: ARRL's Other Founder\\", edited by William Gabour AAR6AG, from Army Mars at 90 by William C. Sexton, 1996, pages 76-77. Although good at receiving weak signals, a drawback of the superdyne circuit was that it took an expert to use it properly. Eventually demand outpaced the company's capabilities, so it began farming out some activities to other concerns, including the A. C. Gilbert Company in New Haven. Westinghouse soon sued to eliminate this practice, claiming it violated the non-transferable provisions of the rights granted by the Armstrong license. In late 1925 it was announced that the C. D. Tuska Company was being acquired by another radio manufacturer.\\"Boston Man to buy Tuska Radio Firm\\", Hartford Courant, December 4, 1925, page 6. This turned out to be the Atwater Kent company, which required an Armstrong license in order to fend off its own legal entanglements with Westinghouse. Radio station WQB In August 1921, the C. D. Tuska Company was issued a license for a Limited Commercial radio station with the call letters WQB,\\"New stations: Commercial Land\\" Radio Service Bulletin, September 1, 1921, page 2. Around the same time the company received an Experimental license with the call sign 1XV, which was deleted a year later. which was located at Tuska's home at 136 Oakland Terrace. The station was used to investigate developing radiotelephones for two-way mobile communication, and an August 1921 report noted the successful test of \\"a full-fledged wireless outfit in the rear of [Fire Chief John C. Moran's] Marmon touring car\\".\\"Carries Radio Phone in Rear of Motor Car\\", Washington (D.C.) Sunday Star, August 28, 1921, Part 3, page 3. WQB was also one of the first post-World War One stations to conduct regular entertainment broadcasts, although at the time the station received its initial (and only) license in August 1921 there were no regulations in the United States defining broadcasting, so WQB was never formally classified as being a broadcasting station. By February 1922, it was reported that the station was transmitting on 360 meters (833 kHz), and Tuska had \\"just completed a 'broadcasting' room\\" studio. The most ambitious programs were twice-a-week evening broadcasts from the Capitol Theater,\\"Wireless Concert at Tuska Station\\", Hartford Courant, February 21, 1922, page 12. featuring organ recitals by Walter Dawley.\\"Radio Phone Menus For Present Week: WQB\\", Hartford Courant, March 12, 1922, page X3. But Tuska soon suspended most of WQB's broadcasts, with the explanation that he \\"was obliged to discontinue broadcasting as he needed to devote all his time to the activities of the C. D. Tuska Co.\\" Although there were occasional reports of additional broadcasts as late as April, regular operations had ceased, and WQB was formally deleted on June 24, 1922.and Corrections: Commercial Land Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, July 1, 1922, page 5. WQB's deletion was reported in \\"Commercial Land Stations\\" section, rather than the \\"Broadcasting Station\\" section. Later life The remainder of Tuska's working life was in the radio field. In March 1922, he participated in the establishment of the Hartford Courant's new broadcasting station, WDAK,Initial WDAK Limited Commercial license, serial #413, issued on May 22, 1922. WDAK was deleted on July 30, 1924. even loaning the transmitting tubes formerly used at WQB in order to help the newspaper start operations. After the sale of the C. D. Tuska Company to Atwater Kent, he began working in that concern's patent office, earning a law degree from LaSalle Extension University in 1934. The next year he joined the Radio Corporation of America, where he became Director of Patent Operations in 1947. He became an expert in the field, authoring books that included Patent Notes for Engineers in 1956, Inventors and Inventions in 1957Inventors and Inventions by C. D. Tuska, 1957. and Accounting and Tax Aspects of Patents and Research (with J. A.

Tuska, Journal of the Franklin Institute, Volume 255, Issue 3, (March 1953) pages 177-188. Tuska's concluding request was that someone invent \\"a practical, neat, sanitary, refillable, tooth paste dispenser with a cap that refuses to be lost\\".

In 1921, she earned her master's degree from the University of Oklahoma in the field of Geology. Dollie was married to Charlie Hall, her childhood sweetheart. Though she faced professional exclusion as one of the only female geologists in her field, she followed through in pursuing Geology as her field of study.  Career  After her graduation, she joined the Amerada Petroleum Corp. as an assistant geologist. In 1927 she became the world's first female to act as chief geologist, where her presence in the company, and field increased. In this position she was responsible for directing operations regarding drilling, land exploration, and leasing. Like many female geologists of the time, Radler Hall faced difficulty as a geology academic and professional as there were few women who were being recognized. Discrimination in the work field due to her gender lead her to resigning as chief geologist in 1930. While working for Amerada Petroleum Corp. she supervised land exploration in the northern United States, before resigning in 1950 and starting a consulting business. Hall played an important role in the Stanolind Deal, showcasing her business abilities and eventually lead to Standard Oil buying a part of Amerada's acreage for $2.5 million. Alongside her career, Radler Hall was an active member in the American Association for the Advancement of Science, as well as the Business and Professional Women's Club. Radler Hall is noted on her works in Cuba in regards to oil, and her publication of \\"A Look at the Oil Possibilities of Cuba.\\" Hall was also an original founding member creating the Energy Minerals Division for the American Association of Petroleum Geologists.  Research  Hall focused her research in Cuba, looking at the sedimentary rocks and the possible oil within the rocks. Cuba has 3 sedimentary basins that contain several types of igneous rocks. Areas of Cuba that contain Serpentinite, is found to have oil or oil residue. Hall mentions that Serpentinite are found within the Jurassic and Cretaceous layers of rock, and that the stratigraphy of these sediments have evidence of intrusion by other types of igneous rocks. The geology of Cuba, contains three stratigraphic sections: Cretaceous, Jurassic, and Tertiary. The three stratigraphic sections have become complicated structures as they have experienced deformation, unconformities, folds and faulted rock. Accumulated amounts of oil can be found within the complicated structure of beds but finding out where to prospect for oil is one out of many concerns.

He is known for his contributions to the understanding of the evolution of early hominids, including the discovery of a tooth from a hominid that was more than one million years older than the oldest previously known hominid. The discovery changed scientific opinion regarding the ancestral splits between humans, chimps and gorillas. A professor at the University Museum of the University of Tokyo, Suwa is a foreign associate of the National Academy of Sciences and a recipient of the Asahi Prize. Biography Suwa completed an undergraduate degree in biology from the University of Tokyo, and he earned a master's degree in biological anthropology from the same institution in 1980. He earned a Ph.D. in anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley. He began to study hominid fossils in Ethiopia during his doctoral studies. He worked with Berkeley anthropology professor Tim D. White and has continued to collaborate with him after graduate school. Before joining the faculty at the University of Tokyo, Suwa worked at the Primate Research Institute at Kyoto University. Since 1990, Suwa has done archaeological work at the Middle Awash site in Ethiopia's Afar Triangle. In 1992, Suwa found a tooth belonging to a primitive hominid. The hominid in question was at first thought to belong to the same species as the 3.2-million-year-old Lucy (Australopithecus). Within a year, sixteen more fossil specimens were found in the area, and in late 1994, a partial skeleton was located. Suwa used micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and a 3-D stereolithic printer to reconstruct the skeleton. In 2009, the hominid was determined to belong to its own species (Ardipithecus ramidus) and to be more than a million years older than Lucy. The skeleton became known as Ardi. A special issue of the journal Science was published that year featuring 11 articles on various aspects of the research on Ardipithecus. In 2007, Suwa was working in the Chorora Formation when he discovered several teeth belonging to an extinct ape. Suwa's group named the newly discovered species Chororapithecus abyssinicus. The characteristics of the teeth suggested that the species was an ancestral branch in the gorilla lineage. In 2016, Suwa and several associates - including archaeologist Yonas Beyene and paleontologist Berhane Asfaw, both from Ethiopia - determined that the teeth were about 8 million years old. The discovery indicated that modern apes originally came from Africa and not Asia. The age of the species showed that the human-chimp split and the gorilla-human split occurred several million years earlier than most scientists had thought. Suwa won the Asahi Prize in 2009 for his work on the science behind early human evolution. The Japanese award is given to people who make outstanding contributions in academics or the arts. In 2016, Suwa was elected a foreign associate of the National Academy of Sciences. He is a full professor at University Museum, University of Tokyo.

The show follows Hamilton Morris as he explores the history, chemistry, and societal impact of psychoactive substances. It chronicles Morris' travels and first-hand experiences, as well as interviews with scientists, shamans, and fringe culture figures. Background Hamilton Morris, son of Oscar-winning documentarian Errol Morris, began writing for the print magazine VICE while he was still a sophomore at The New School. His first article, under the pseudonym D.H. Ticklish, reported on emerging psychoactive drugs. After publishing a second article, about young Hasidic men converting to rituals with psychedelics, Morris started a column called Hamilton's Pharmacopeia. This evolved into an identically titled webseries on VBS.tv, which developed into the television program for Viceland. Morris' unique qualifications include studies under psychedelics expert Nicolas Langlitz at The New School and scientific publications as a pharmacology researcher at the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia. He works as a contributor to Harper's Magazine and National Geographic TV, as a correspondent for VICE on HBO, and as a science editor for VICE Magazine. Morris publicly advocates psychonaut interests, following in the footsteps of drug developer and self-tester Alexander Shulgin, who authored the seminal text on phenethylamines, a class of drugs including MDMA. His scholarly approach also incorporates what he calls \\"ethno-chemistry,\\" an anthropological exploration of the cultural matrix that influences drug use.

C. ‚ÄúBill‚Äù Wolverton (born 1932) is an American scientist specialized in chemistry, microbiology, biochemistry, marine biology and environmental engineering. He is well known for being the principal investigator of the famous NASA Clean Air Study, where plants were tested in order to find out their ability to purify air. He completed his PhD in environmental engineering in 1978. Biography=Early life and career Bill Wolverton was born and lived his early life in the rural areas of Mississippi. After high school he served in the United States Air Force during the Korean Conflict and the Air National Guard. After military service, he was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry from Mississippi College in 1960. He completed three years of graduate studies at the University of Mississippi School of Medicine. He also served as a research assistant and participated in isolation, identification and immunological studies of abnormal high-molecular-weight blood proteins found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and multiple myeloma. In 1963 he became a civilian scientist and headed the Chemical/Biological Branch Laboratory at the Naval Weapons Laboratory in Dahlgren, Virginia. There he researched methods for protecting military from chemical/biological warfare. In 1965 he transferred to Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, where he served as Chief of the Assessments Branch of the Air Force Armament Laboratory. He continued research on the subject of chemical/biological warfare during the Vietnam War. His studies resulted in numerous patents. In Florida he also studied Marine Biology at the University of West Florida. In 1971 he was recruited to NASA as head of the Environmental Research Laboratory at the Mississippi Test Facility (now the John C. Stennis Space Center). His research efforts focused upon three specific areas of study: 1) pursue plant-based options for a 'closed ecological life support system' for long-term space habitation; 2) seek practical applications for biotechnologies to treat wastewaters; and 3) seek 'spin-off' applications for solving earthly environmental pollution problems. After completing his doctoral degree in environmental engineering in 1978, he turned his attention to indoor air quality problems. He worked together with his colleague Dr. Rebecca McDonald-McCaleb to conduct pioneering research to determine the ability of interior plants to remove volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) from the indoor environment. Their findings were first published in 1984 in the Journal of Economic Botany. In 1983, Dr. Wolverton was named the Federal Environmental Engineer of the Year. In 1988 Dr. Wolverton was one of the first inductees into the U.S. Space Foundation's Hall of Fame. Further studies on the ability of interior plants to improve the indoor environment continued through a jointly funded program with NASA and the Associated Landscape Contractors of America. In 1989 the results of their findings were released in a NASA report entitled 'Interior Landscape Plants for Indoor Air Pollution' and at a joint news conference at the National Press Club, Washington, D.C. in conjunction with a 'Plants for Clean Air Day' on Capitol Hill. This report received worldwide attention and Dr. Wolverton appeared on many television shows and granted interviews by journalists from across the globe. He also authored more than 70 scientific technical papers during his career. In 1990, following the release of the NASA Clean Air Study, Dr. Wolverton retired from NASA and started a small research company of his own (Wolverton Environmental Services) together with his wife Yvonne and son, John. Since leaving NASA he has lectured throughout the world; written books on the subject and been awarded numerous patents. In 2010 Dr. Wolverton was inducted into the Plantscape Industry Alliance Hall of Fame.

Biography  A New York native, Hamlin spent his formative years in Chicago, Illinois and currently resides outside Boulder, Colorado.See: http://coloradoreview.colostate.edu/wp- content/uploads/2016/07/Colorado-Review-Summer-2016-Contributor-Notes.pdf He received an A.B. with Special Honors from the University of Chicago in 1981 and was inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa Society in 1980. Hamlin did graduate work toward a PhD in Buddhist Studies at the University of Michigan from 1983 to 1984.  Writing and recognition  Hamlin‚Äôs work has appeared in numerous literary magazines, including Ploughshares, the Colorado Review, the Bellevue Literary Review, the Missouri Review and Chariton Review. His short story collection, Night in Erg Chebbi and Other Stories (University of Iowa Press 2015, ), was selected by author Karen Russell as winner of the 2015 Iowa Short Fiction Award and was subsequently published, to positive reviews, by the University of Iowa Press. The collection went on to win the Colorado Book Award for short story collections. Edward Hamlin, 2015 In addition to the Iowa and Colorado awards, Hamlin‚Äôs work has been recognized with a Nelligan Prize and a Top of the Mountain Book Award, and has been a finalist for the Flannery O‚ÄôConnor Award for Short Fiction, the Narrative Story Contest, the American Fiction Prize, the Mary C. Mohr Editors‚Äô Award, the David Nathan Myerson Fiction Prize and the Jeffrey E. Smith Editors‚Äô Prize. In 2013, his story ‚ÄúThe Release‚Äù was named runner-up for the Nelson Algren Award. In the United Kingdom, his stories ‚ÄúInd√≠gena‚Äù and ‚ÄúAfter Dreamland‚Äù were shortlisted for the Bridport prize in 2014 and 2016 respectively. Two of his stories have been nominated for the Pushcart Prize. The story ‚ÄúPhone Phone Gun‚Äù was performed theatrically, in Denver, as part of the 2012-2013 season of Stories on Stage. Critical response to Hamlin‚Äôs work has been positive. Pulitzer Prize finalist Karen Russell called his stories ‚Äúsweeping and intimate and awesomely confident of their own effects,‚Äù while Publishers Weekly described Night in Erg Chebbi and Other Stories as ‚Äúa memorable read from a writer with considerable talent.‚Äù Foreword Reviews described the collection as \\"beautiful, terrifying and compassionate.\\"  Themes and style  Hamlin‚Äôs writing explores what happens when ordinary people are confronted with choices they never thought they would have to make. His characters are often caught unprepared by circumstances in which they must quickly decide what to do, then live out the consequences‚Äîoften unintended‚Äîof their actions. Stylistically, Hamlin‚Äôs stories make extensive use of free indirect discourse and third- person narrative; very few of his stories are told in first person. Many feature women as central point-of-view characters, and international settings such as Haiti under the regime of Jean-Claude Duvalier, Brazil, Morocco and Northern Ireland are common. Reviewers have noted Hamlin‚Äôs close attention to sensory detail and use of exotic locales.  Music  In addition to his literary work, Hamlin is a composer and performer of acoustic guitar music. His 2007 CD Rooted and subsequent work explores the possibilities of jazz- and Celtic-inflected fingerstyle guitar, making extensive use of altered tunings, especially DGDGCD and CGDGCD (‚ÄúOrkney tuning‚Äù). Of Rooted, Minor 7th Magazine wrote: \\"This debut outing reveals a mature acoustic guitarist who is unnecessarily modest about his well-refined craft‚Ä¶ The tone is elegiac‚Ä¶ One hears surrender to the allure of the instrument, all in itself.\\" References External links  *http://www.edwardhamlin.com Category:Living people Category:1959 births Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:University of Michigan alumni Category:American fiction writers Category:21st-century American composers ","title":"Edward Hamlin (fiction writer)"},{"id":"52189964","text":"NASA astronaut Catherine Coleman plays a flute aboard the International Space Station in 2011. Music in space is music played in or broadcast from a spacecraft in outer space. The first ever song that was performed in space was a Ukrainian song ‚ÄúI look up at the sky‚Äù (‚Äú–î–∏–≤–ª—é—Å—å —è –Ω–∞ –Ω–µ–±–æ‚Äù) sang on 12 August 1962 by Pavlo Popovych, cosmonaut from Ukraine at a special request of Serhiy Korolyov, rocket engineer and spacecraft designer widely regarded as ‚ÄúThe Father of Practical Astronautics‚Äù who was also from Ukraine. According to the Smithsonian Institution, the first musical instruments played in outer space were an 8-note Hohner \\"Little Lady\\" harmonica and a handful of small bells carried by American astronauts Wally Schirra and Thomas P. Stafford aboard Gemini 6A. Upon achieving a space rendezvous in Earth orbit with their sister ship Gemini 7 in December 1965, Schirra and Stafford played a rendition of \\"Jingle Bells\\" over the radio after jokingly claiming to have seen an unidentified flying object piloted by Santa Claus. The instruments had been smuggled on-board without NASA's knowledge, leading Mission Control director Elliot See to exclaim \\"You're too much\\" to Schirra after the song. The harmonica was donated to the Smithsonian by Schirra in 1967, with his note that it \\"...plays quite well\\". In the 1970s music tape cassettes were brought to the American space station Skylab, while Soviet cosmonauts Aleksandr Laveikin and Yuri Romanenko brought a guitar to the space station Mir in 1987. Musical instruments must be checked for gases they may emit before being taken aboard the confined environment of a space station. As of 2003, instruments that have been aboard the International Space Station include a flute, a keyboard guitar, a saxophone, and a didgeridoo. Music in space has been a focal point of public relation events of various human spaceflight programs. NASA astronaut Carl Walz played a rendition of the Elvis Presley song \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" aboard the ISS in 2003 which was also recorded and transmitted to Earth. Canadian Space Agency astronaut Chris Hadfield, commander of Expedition 35 to the International Space Station, recorded a music video of the song \\"Space Oddity\\" by David Bowie aboard the space station. The first music video ever shot in space, the video went viral and received widespread international media coverage after being posted to YouTube. Bowie himself later called the cover \\"possibly the most poignant version of the song ever created\\". Dongfanghong I Dongfanghong I () was the People's Republic of China's first space satellite, launched successfully on 24 April 1970 as part of the PRC's Dongfanghong space satellite program. The satellite carried a radio transmitter which broadcast the song of the same name, D≈çngfƒÅngh√≥ng or \\"The East Is Red\\"; the broadcast lasted for 20 days while in orbit. Apollo 17 A few bars of \\"The Fountain in the Park\\" were sung on the Moon by NASA Astronauts Harrison Schmitt and Eugene Cernan on the 1972 Apollo 17 mission. Schmitt started by singing \\"I was strolling on the Moon one day...\\" when Cernan joined in. Cernan kept with the original \\"merry month of May\\", however, while Schmitt sang \\"December\\", which was the actual date at the time. After a brief debate, Schmitt resumed, singing \\"When much to my surprise, a pair of bonny eyes...\\" until he could no longer remember the lyrics and began vocalizing the notes instead. Moments later, Capsule Communicator Robert A. Parker cut in from Houston, saying \\"sorry about that, guys, but today may be December.\\" Voyager Golden Record The music is recorded in the circular grooves of this disc, which was attached to the spacecraft(s) The Voyager program probes Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 were launched by NASA with a message aboard ‚Äî a kind of time capsule, intended to communicate a story of the world of humans on Earth. The records feature spoken greetings in fifty-nine languages, \\"sounds of Earth\\", and a 90-minute selection of music from many cultures, including Eastern and Western classics.  Pink Floyd  On 21 November 1988, a cassette tape of Pink Floyd's live Delicate Sound of Thunder album (minus the cassette box, for weight reasons) was taken into space by the crew of the Soviet Soyuz TM-7 mission. The launch, at Baikonur Cosmodrome, was attended by the band's David Gilmour and Nick Mason, who made an audio recording of the event for potential use in a future project. This was claimed by Gilmour to have been the first rock music recording in space. The tape was left on the Mir space station when the mission crew returned to Earth. Beagle 2 and Blur In 2003 the British space organization's Beagle 2 probe was scheduled to play a song from the UK music band Blur, upon touchdown on the planet Mars. It was not known what happened to Beagle 2 for 11 years after landing, and it was considered lost. When it was found intact in 2015, however, the possibility was raised that Beagle 2 had successfully played the song on Christmas Day in 2003 upon landing, but failed to transmit back to Earth. Curiosity rover and Reach for the Stars American recording artist will.i.am wrote, produced, and recorded the song \\"Reach for the Stars\\" (and their instrumental-driven version subtitled \\"Mars Edition\\" and \\"NASA Edition\\") in commemoration of the landing of the Curiosity rover on Mars. The song was first released on August 28, 2012, and it became the first song that was successfully broadcast from another planet. Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster \\"Starman\\" prop rocks out to Bowie en route to the Asteroid belt Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster was launched into Earth orbit, then Solar orbit, in February 2018 as part of the Falcon Heavy Test Flight. The sound system on board the car was looping David Bowie's songs \\"Space Oddity\\" and \\"Life on Mars?\\".  Project DaVinci CubeSat  As a part of NASA's ElaNa 19 initiative, 18 year-old millionaire Erik Finman collaborated with a team of high school students from Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, and designed a CubeSat named Project DaVinci. The CubeSat serves as a time capsule orbiting around the Earth, and contains a collection of videos, music and movies, including Taylor Swift's 2014 album, 1989. The album was uploaded to the satellite, while its Swift-autographed CD was engraved to the satellite's side. DaVinci was launched into space on December 16, 2018, from Mahia, New Zealand.

It was released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 in late 2016. Players must have a virtual reality headset, such as the Oculus Rift, PlayStation VR, or HTC Vive, in order to play the game. The game is set fifty years after humanity's extinction, focusing on a post- apocalyptic version of Paris. Players assume control of an eagle, which must travel around the city and defeat rival animals in order to build its nest on five different landmarks. Gameplay revolves around players tilting their heads to control the movement of the eagle, and using sonar waves to defeat enemies. The game also features a six-player competitive multiplayer Capture the Flag- styled mode, and a cooperative multiplayer mode called Free Flight, which allows the player to explore the city with five other players. Development of the game began in October 2014 after the completion of Far Cry 4. The game was greenlit in mid-2015, through Ubisoft's own idea-pitching platform, Fun House. The game was originally set in Notre Dame de Paris, but the scale was later expanded to include the entire city. To reduce the possibility of players suffering from motion sickness, the team researched extensively and read NASA's articles and documents on the subject. Inon Zur served as the game's composer; the soundtracks were described as \\"soaring and uplifting\\". Announced at PlayStation Experience 2015, the game was the first virtual reality game developed by Ubisoft. It received mixed to positive reviews upon its release, with critics praising the game's controls, gameplay, and the competitive multiplayer mode, but criticizing the single-player mode and city's design. Setting In the near future, fifty years after humanity's extinction, wildlife in Paris is flourishing. Nature has reclaimed the land, and the city has become home to various animals and plants. As an eagle inhabiting the city, the player must explore it, venturing to different landmarks to build a nest. According to Ubisoft, the goal of the game is to \\"[build a] nest on Paris' tallest landmark and conquer the skies\\". Gameplay Eagle Flight is a first-person, simulation game, which tasks players to assume control of an eagle. As the bird moves forward continuously, its direction is controlled by the player's head movement. For instance, if the player tilts their head to the left, the eagle will turn in that direction. The player also uses a controller to slow down or speed up the eagle's flight speed. Set in a post- apocalyptic version of Paris in the near future, the game's backstory is revealed to the player by a narrator. The single-player mode consists of five different districts. Each district has one chapter, which tasks players to build nests on landmarks after defeating the rival wildlife guarding them. Earlier chapters require players to explore the landmark; later chapters usually end with a race challenge where players must pass through numerous rings while evading attacks from enemies, such as falcons, crows, vultures, and bats. The eagle can also use sonic waves to kill its enemies. In addition to completing story missions, players can also explore the world, collect collectibles such as feathers and fish, and attempt numerous challenges found in the game's world. Players are graded according to their performance in these challenges. If the player crashes into a building, the challenge restarts. The game also features a three-versus-three Capture the Flag-style competitive multiplayer mode. In this mode, two teams of players are tasked to grab a rabbit corpse and carry it back to their nests. Teamwork is emphasized, as players must work cooperatively to fend off their opponents and transport the carcass back to their nest. In this mode, players can attack their opponents using sonic waves, and defend themselves by using a temporal shield that is capable of deflecting attacks, or simply dodge or fly through tight spaces to evade attacks. The game also features the Free Flight mode, which allows players to explore the city with five other players. Development The game's development began in October 2014, after team lead Olivier Palmieri completed his work on Far Cry 4, another Ubisoft game. He, along with several other Ubisoft co-workers at Ubisoft Montreal, pitched the game's prototype to Ubisoft's own Fun House division, an idea-pitching platform, at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015 and Gamescom 2015. The project received enough buzz that it was officially greenlit. The first prototype was originally named Inside Notre Dame, and tasked players to explore Notre Dame de Paris in first- person. The scale was later expanded to include the whole of Paris. According to Fun House's Patrick Plourde, the team chose Paris as the game's setting as most team members came from the city, and the complex and intricate street layouts of Paris allowed the team to create a more diverse flying experience. The team intentionally avoided using science fiction as they felt it is an overused setting. According to Palmieri, the main design philosophy behind the game was that it had to be comfortable, intuitive, and accessible. To learn about motion sickness, the team read NASA's documents on stroboscopic treatments, as well as information regarding the vestibulo-ocular reflex. The team later decided to use head movement as the game's primary control. Despite initial concerns that head movement would be a very clumsy way to control the character, they were impressed by its precision after extensive playtesting, with Palmieri saying that the results \\"went beyond [their] expectations\\". The team felt that head tracking control was one of the simplest and most accessible ways for non-gamers to enjoy the game, as head movement is inborn and a player would not need to move their arms or learn how to use a traditional controller. In addition, this method of control is the most direct and natural because of its close proximity with the brain. The team experimented with numerous methods to prevent players from suffering motion sickness while playing the game. They eventually discovered that having the player see the eagle's beak prevented them from feeling nauseous as it is a fixed reference point that allows players to anchor their perspective. The team also investigated causes of motion sickness, and concluded that reduced peripheral vision, by having a dynamic vision-blocking system, can also help solve the problem. To ensure that the brain would not feel queasiness, the team tried to create a consistent experience to ensure that instances of seeing but not feeling motion would not occur. The team programmed the game so the screen fades-to-black instantly if the player collides with other objects. Inon Zur, who had previously worked on the original soundtracks of Dragon Age: Origins and Fallout 4, served as the game's composer. Zur's soundtrack was described as \\"soaring and uplifting\\". In addition to employing an orchestra to perform the music, Zur also included primitive sounds and high-pitch vocal music to further enhance one of the game's themes: the nature of beauty. The game was officially revealed at Sony Interactive Entertainment's PlayStation Experience 2016 conference. The game was released for the Oculus Rift on October 18, 2016, and for PlayStation VR and HTC Vive on November 8, 2016, and December 20, 2016, respectively. It is the first virtual reality game Ubisoft has released. Reception Eagle Flight received \\"favorable\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Chris Carter of Destructoid praised the game's accessible controls and intense multiplayer mode. He also appreciated the game's simplistic nature, and was pleased that Ubisoft did not turn it into a spin-off of one of their open world games. However, he criticized the city design, which he considered empty and repetitive, and had issues related to Uplay. Jimmy Thang of GameSpot praised the game's comfortable control scheme and complex multiplayer, but was disappointed by the shallow single-player mode and the general lack of content. IGN's Brian Albert also praised the intuitive control scheme, particularly praising the game's accessibly. He found the concept of the game \\"weird\\" but \\"well executed\\", opining that it is a fresh venture into virtual reality. His main concern was the lack of content.

Early life and education  Evelyn Gillan was born in the mining town of Tranent, East Lothian, on 4 August 1959. Her mother, Bridget, was a civil service administrator and her father, Joe, was a postal worker. She had one younger sister, Jacky, and one older sister, Valerie. Dux of her primary school, Gillan was academically successful and was expected to go straight to university but elected instead to become a hairdresser in a salon in Edinburgh. She then travelled in Europe for a few years, working odd jobs in several countries along the way.  Moray House: School of Education and early activism  Gillan returned to Edinburgh in 1976, studying social work at Moray House. Her earliest activism as a student found her leading a campaign against the Chilean Dictator Pinochet and subsequently being elected President of the Students‚Äô Council. Rossana Leal recalls arriving in Scotland in 1977, as a Chilean refugee, saying that: On leaving Moray House, Gillan received the Gordon memorial award, presented to the best all-around student.  Career  Gillan was appointed as Campaigns Officer of the Women‚Äôs Committee of Edinburgh Council in 1985. She initiated several campaigns, including Edinburgh for Free, Safer Streets, Change the Change, and Zero Tolerance, and organized the annual celebrations for International Women's Day. In 2002, she went on sabbatical to spend time with her young son and complete her PhD in social policy at University of Edinburgh (which she completed in 2008). In 2006, Gillan became the first director of Scottish Health Action on Alcohol Problems (SHAAP). She was appointed chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland in 2010, and the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act was passed in 2012, during her tenure there.  Death and legacy  Gillan became ill with gastric cancer in 2014, and was named an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, in recognition of her work in promoting Scotland‚Äôs health shortly before her death on 14 July 2015. Zero Tolerance Board member Lesley Orr said: \\"Evelyn is in the great tradition of thrawn Scots who shake up complacency, disrupt the way things are, and won't let go until they‚Äôve been transformed.

Language The language traditionally spoken by the Badu people and their Mabuiag neighbours is Kala Lagaw Ya, a member of the Pama-Nyungan language family. Ecology Badu, together with Moa Island to its West from which it is separated by a narrow channel, is one of the largest in the Torres Strait. Circular in form, roughly 6 kilometres in diameter it is surrounded by complex tides that can run up to 7 knots. Generally sparsely wooded, and rocky, the northern part of the island is fringed with dense mangroves. Headhunting Badu Island in particular, with the publication of Ion Idriess's novel The Wild White Man of Badu (1950), gained a reputation as an island of headhunters, though the practice was widespread throughout the Torres Strait. Taking the head of one's enemy was a ritual practice, involving a cane hoop and a special bamboo knife (upi) for severing the head, then boiling it and dressing it with beeswax noses and eyes fashioned from nautilus nacre. History Willem Janszoon in the Duyfken as early as 1605 sailed close to the island of Badu while en route back to the East Indies after a reconnaissance of New Guinea for the Dutch East India Company. The impression left of the region was of a waste land populated by cruel savages. The island itself, together with Mabuiagm was later charted by William Bligh.

She studies the role of bacteria in Earth's marine nutrient cycles, and is a leader in the fields of marine sciences and biogeochemistry. Her work is focused on how microbes interact with dissolved organic matter and the impact of microbial diversity on the global carbon and sulfur cycles. By defining the roles of diverse bacteria in the carbon and sulfur cycles, she connects the biogeochemical and organismal approaches in marine science. For her leadership and contributions to science, Moran is a recipient of many awards and honors including a Creative Research Medal from the University of Georgia and the White Research and Mentoring Award from the American Society for Microbiology. She is also a Fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  Education  Mary Ann Moran received her Bachelor of Arts degree in Biology in 1977 at the Colgate University in Hamilton, NY. She went on to get her Masters of Science degree in Natural Resources in 1982 at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. Finally, she received her Ph.D. in the Graduate Program in Ecology in 1987 at the University of Georgia, in Athens, GA. She studied the variables affecting the biodegration rates of lignocellulose in wetland ecosystems under Robert E. Hodson. After receiving her Ph.D. she stayed at the University of Georgia to pursue her research.  Research and discoveries  Mary Ann Moran's research focuses on the role of bacteria in the marine carbon and sulfur cycles. In order to decipher the role of bacteria and better understand the diverse metabolisms occurring in the ocean, she uses ecological genomics, metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to study the genes and activity of marine bacteria in nature.  Carbon and sulfur cycle  As she progressed in her career, Moran's research focused on organic compounds and metabolic interactions that occur between dissolved organic matter and marine microbial communities. This field of science is what she remains studying to this day. Her major contributions have been in the research of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the role of bacteria in marine biogeochemical cycles. She focuses mainly on the carbon and sulfur cycle. * Organic matter is composed of carbon based compounds made by biological organisms. Organic matter can be found in soil, sediments, and water and is an important component of all ecosystems. It provides habitat, food and nutrients for organisms, controls nutrient exchange, aids in soil water retention, and can store significant amounts of carbon. Understanding the degradation of organic matter is critical to understanding the carbon cycle. * Dissolved Organic Matter is dead forms of organic material, such as dead plant parts, that has degraded and dissolved to become a constituent of large or small bodies of water. Despite the importance of DOM in freshwater and marine ecosystems, the chemical make up is poorly understood. * Biogeochemistry is the study of natural cycles such as the Carbon cycle and Sulfur cycle, which recycle vital elements of living matter. As described in her 2015 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences paper, a large amount of organic matter is released by phytoplankton and then degraded by heterotrophic bacteria in the ocean surface. Compounds important for the trophic link are poorly known because there are thousands of chemicals making up marine DOM. One of the goals of Moran's research group is to predict how microbes and dissolved organic matter respond to our changing climate and how those responses, in turn, affect the global carbon cycle. Since there are thousands of chemicals that make up marine DOM, the compounds are therefore, poorly known. Her research group grew two microorganisms together in the lab: a Roseobacter clade bacterium and a photosynthetic diatom. They used changes in gene expression to identify compounds made by the diatom that were then metabolized (eaten) by the bacterium. They identified that the diatom made large amounts of 2,3-dihydroxypropane-1-sulfonate (DHPS), a previously unknown diatom metabolite that was also specifically used by the bacterium as a food source. Moran's group also showed that DHSP was abundant in natural diatom populations and was an actively cycled compound in seawater. This research identified a missing component of the marine carbon and sulfur cycles and will most likely lead to a more detailed understanding of the marine carbon and sulfur cycle.  Roseobacter and clouds  Roseobacter species were first cultured in 1991 from the surface of marine algae. Using DNA and RNA sequencing methods developed by Moran for use in marine environments, Moran's research group demonstrated that a large portion of coastal and mixed-layer ocean bacterioplankton fall into the Roseobacter clade of Alphaproteobacteria. In addition, she has studied the physiology, genetics, and ecology of the Roseobacter clade extensively, firmly establishing their importance in many marine ecosystems. Another major finding of her research is related to cloud formation. In order for a cloud to form, water must condense into droplets. Organic sulfur compounds in the atmosphere create aerosols that serve as cloud condensation nuclei. An organic sulfur compound known as DMSP (dimethylsulfoniopropionate) is produced in large quantities by photosynthetic plankton in ocean. If DMSP is converted to dimethyl sulfide (DMS), the DMS rises into the atmosphere and increases cloud formation. Moran's research group discovered key genes in Roseobacter and Pelagibacteria that breakdown DMSP into methanethiol instead, a chemical compound that does not enter the atmosphere or increase cloud formation. Basically, Moran's research group made a major discovery that explains connections between the marine microbial food web and cloud formation over the oceans. That research also helped in identifying the biochemical pathway that controls how bacteria release methanethiol into the microbial food web, making it available to other bacteria as well. \\"Isolating and discovering a novel, keystone bacterium from the ocean first, and then sequencing its genome enabled this team to find the genes involved in the DMSP cycle,\\" said Matthew Kane, program director in the National Science Foundation (NSF) Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, which supported the research. \\"The research has revealed the previously hidden role that marine microbes play in the global sulfur cycle.\\"  Honors and scientific leadership  Moran received a Creative Research Medal from the University of Georgia for outstanding research focusing on a single theme in 1997. She was the Chair of the Microbial Ecology Division of the American Society for Microbiology from 2001-2002. In 2005, she was named a Distinguished Research Professor at the University of Georgia to recognize her contributions to her discipline and her research on Roseobacter species. She was elected to the American Academy of Microbiology in 2006. She served as a Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation Marine Microbiology Initiative Investigator from 2004-2012 for her work on the genomics of marine bacteria , and in 2016 she received a second award from this foundation to study the movement of carbon between marine microbes. She was the first to receive the White Research and Mentoring Award from the American Society for Microbiology in 2008 to recognize her commitment to mentoring and being a role model for young scientists at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels. To date, she has mentored eight graduate students, nine postdoctoral students, 25 undergraduate students, and five high school interns. Moran was also elected as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2009. She is a member of multiple boards and committees, including the Scientific Advisory Board of the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology since 2009, the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) Prokaryotic Super Program Advisory Committee since 2011, the JGI Scientific Advisory Committee since 2012, the Science Board of Reviewing Editors since 2015, and the American Academy of Microbiology Board of Governors since 2014.

The branch, opened in 1907, was the borough's eleventh Carnegie library. Richard A. Walker designed Macon in the Classical Revival style and the library was built from red brick and limestone trim with a slate roof at a cost of $93,481 (). In the 1940s, 1970s, and 2000s, the library underwent major renovations and repairs. Despite the changes, design elements present at the library's opening remain, including some bookshelves, guardrails, and wood paneling. Macon Library houses the African American Heritage Center. History Situated in Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant, Brooklyn, Macon Library was the eleventh Carnegie library‚Äìlibraries built with a donation from businessman and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie‚Äìto be constructed as part of the Brooklyn Public Library system. Costing $93,481 ($71,481 for the building and its furnishings plus an additional $22,000 for the site), the library was designed by Richard A. Walker of Walker & Morris and built in 1907 on a corner lot at the intersection of Macon Street and Lewis Avenue. The library's construction was conducted by Daniel Ryan of Manhattan. In 1906, the New York City Board of Estimate designated $10,000 for the library's collection. The branch library's opening on July 15, 1907, was attended by 2,000 visitors. Upon its opening, Macon held 10,000 books with the space to expand to 25,000. The library has undergone a number of repairs and renovations. Between 1948 and 1949, Macon was closed for a repainting, the installation of new windows, the addition of a new heater, and the removal of partitions in its reading areas. Efforts to modernize the library's interior space took place from 1973 to 1977 including an HVAC upgrade, the construction of an auditorium, and the installation of fluorescent lighting. Around 1996, the library was being rehabilitated once again, with efforts underway to improve library accessibility and the building's air conditioning system, and to install a new roof designed to mimic the original roof. The latter project was headed by the architect Leslie Defer. Macon was again renovated between 2006 and 2008 by Sen Architects. The project was intended to bring the library closer to its original appearance by making HVAC systems less visible and replacing the hanging fluorescent lights with lamps like those in the space when it opened. The renovation also included the addition of the African American Heritage Center. The Brooklyn Public Library announced that Macon Library would be one of the first six libraries in its system to receive exterior digital signage, the first upgrade of exterior signage across the Brooklyn system in over two decades. The project, completed in summer 2017, totaled $35,000. Architecture and features Macon Library stands two stories tall and is slightly raised above street level. It occupies the majority of the lot upon which it is situated. The building was designed in the Classical Revival architectural style and consists of five bays. While the library was mainly built with red brick, its front entrance is highlighted by a stone border adorned above the front door with a cartouche. The doors and windows are surrounded by an Indiana limestone trim. Macon Library is capped with a dentillated cornice, below which its windows rest, high on the building's facade. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle singled out Macon as one of Brooklyn's best-lighted libraries in 1907. Near the front entrance are two pillars that at one time sported lamps. The building is surrounded by an iron fence and topped with a slate roof. Inside, the library is divided into two main spaces: alcoves and larger reading areas. The building's main desk is located in the center-front of the floor plan, while its stacks are located in the back, on the first and second floors. On the upper level, the original metal guardrail continues to protect patrons, and the bookcases and wood paneling that was present when Macon opened is also still used. The library's small alcoves contain wooden benches and fireplaces present when the library opened. A series of frescoes and panels with phrases such as and were inlaid on the mantelpieces above the fireplaces, but the panels with their verbiages are no longer present.

He is best known by the series of photographs he made in 1865 by Dante Gabriel Rossetti's model Jane Morris. Life and work Parsons was born in Dublin, the son of gentleman Henry Parsons and his wife, Jane, of Richmond Lodge. He was baptised in April 1827 at St. George's Church, Dublin, and grew up in County Cork. He moved in 1840 to London. There he worked as a painter and between 1850 and 1868 he exhibited several times at the Royal Academy of Arts and Grosvenor Gallery. From 1860 he was also involved with photography and opened a photo studio in Portman Square. Besides portraits, he also took photographs of paintings, including Dante Gabriel Rossetti and James McNeill Whistler. Reverie File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti - Reverie.jpgDante Gabriel Rossetti: Reverie, model : Jane Morris File:Parsons - Jane Burden.jpgJohn Robert Parsons: Jane Morris, 1865 File:16 Cheyne Walk 05.JPG16 Cheyne Walk Today, Parsons still primarily known for the series of pictures he made at the request of Rossetti in the summer of 1865 Rossetti's former muse and model Jane Morris. The photo shoot in Rossetti's garden and house are eighteen portraits known. Rossetti conducted meticulous control over the poses during the session that took Morris, as well as the clothes they wore and the objects and furniture that were used. It is difficult to say how Rossetti took the photos later as a basis for later paintings. His Reverie in 1868 unmistakably resembles one of the pictures taken, but also be seen similarities with other portraits not only of Morris but also with later portraits Rossetti made of Alexa Wilding. Rossetti, however, used the pictures are not as detailed studies, but probably mainly as tools to visualize certain poses and as a reminder for the times that his model was not available. Later Early 1870s Parsons partnered with Rossetti's art dealer Charles Augustin Howell. From about 1870 to 1877 he had a studio in London's Wigmore Street, but from 1878 he photographed no more. From 1888 he would no longer hold exhibitions and he led a secluded life. He was known as a quiet and introverted man. Parsons was declared bankrupt in 1892. In 1909, he died in solitude in a room in Kensington, on the top floor of Mount Carmel Chambers on Dukes Lane. It took almost a month before his body was discovered. The Times published an article on his death under the headline \\"An artist's death.\\" Four days later, after the inquest established that he had died a natural death, the newspaper published an obituary, moreover, in which he was praised as \\"an admirable artist in oil and chalk.\\" Despite his bankruptcy, it was revealed at the inquest into his death that he had \\"plenty of money\\" in the apartment and \\"substantial balance\\" in his bank account. Multiple unfinished paintings were strewn about the apartment. To the general public, he remained unknown, partly because he refused to exhibit in the last decades of his life. A photo portrait Parsons in 1870 made by William Morris currently hangs in the Victoria and Albert Museum. His paintings are located and are scarcely known in private collections.

She actively campaigned for the re-opening of the political space to multi-party democracy during the 2005 referendum. It was not until the run-up to the 2006 general elections, that she formally joined the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) political party. In 2006, at the age of 35, she unseated Margaret Nantongo Zziwa of the National Resistance Movement (NRM) political party, to capture the Women Representative's seat for Kampala in the 8th parliament (2006 to 2011). During the 2011 parliamentary elections, she received 222,724 votes compared to the 164,378 votes her closest challenger, Margaret Zziwa of the NRM received. During 2013, a group of lawyers sued her, the Attorney General of Uganda and the Electoral Commission of Uganda, on a technicality, since the Central Government of Uganda had taken over the management of Kampala on 28 December 2010, and the city had ceased to be regarded as a district.

Moreover, it accounts for 65% of the overall population of the GCC countries and 42% of its GDP. Saudi Arabia does not have a strong history in environmentalism. Thus, as the number of population increases and the industrial activity grows, environmental issues pose a real challenge to the country. Lack of environmental policy can be linked to an enormous reliance on oil. Due to intense fossil fuel usage, Saudi Arabia has generated a number of environmental issues. Urbanization and high standards of living contribute to ground, water, and air pollution. Agriculture and overconsumption of natural resources cause deforestation and desertification. Likewise, Saudi Arabia‚Äôs oil industry subsidizes energy use and magnifies carbon dioxide emissions. These environmental issues cause a variety of health problems including asthma and cancer. Some environmental action is taking place such as the construction of a renewable energy industry. Policies and programs are also being developed to ensure environmental sustainability.  Background  Map of Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia contains the largest known oil reserve. This generates an abundance of wealth for the country and places it as the number one oil exporter in the world. Oil extraction is a priority over environmental policy. While oil is not environmentally sustainable, Saudi Arabia has made some contributions to fighting climate change. The kingdom implemented its first environmental law in 1992, the Presidency of Meteorology and Environmental Protection Act. This measure was enacted to encourage environmental awareness and sustainable law creation. Moreover, Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations are working together to create a series of international environmental contracts. Saudi Arabia alone has signed eighteen pacts and ratified thirty-nine environmental agreements. Saudi Arabia's environmental performance index (EPI) is 55.3. The EPI is an internationally standardized scale, with 1 as the lowest environmental performance and 100 as the highest. The scale measures both environmental health and ecosystem viability. Out of Middle Eastern countries, Saudi Arabia ranks 9th on the EPI.  Environmental challenges = Pollution  Oil pollution = Oil Production in Saudi Arabia As the largest oil exporter in OPEC, Saudi Arabia contributes to the immense environmental impacts associated with oil drilling. This includes hydraulic fracturing, oil spills, and air pollution. Saudi Arabia contributed to the world's most severe spill, the 1991 Gulf War Oil Spill. The environmental impacts from oil spills are long lasting and often irreversible. The Gulf War spill directly affected the Saudi Arabian shoreline. While initial research found minuscule long-term impacts, recent studies show oil persistence in ocean habitats. Oil persistence affects ecosystem relationships and the livelihood of all marine animals. The Gulf Coast spill increased the toxicity of Saudi Arabia's coastline. During the initial aftermath, only visible oil was removed from the Gulf. The rest of the spill has remained in the ocean for the past 25 years and contributes to high- risk amounts of hydrocarbons in the environment. Saudi Arabia's salt marshes have had a hard time recovering from past spills. Thick oil coverage permanently changed the biodiversity and chemical compositions of many ocean related habitats. This environmental damage will take decades to reverse. An abundance of oil resources promotes wasteful energy practices throughout Saudi Arabia. The government encourages energy use through subsidies. Currently, these subsidies are higher than any other regime at a total of 43 billon US dollars a year. Inexpensive energy supports excessive energy use, contributing to high rates of domestic oil consumption. The hot, arid climate of the Middle East causes widespread use of air conditioning for climate control. Power consumption and carbon dioxide emissions increase each year. = Urban pollution = Urbanization causes ground, water, and air pollution. Increasingly urban areas call for more desalinated water and a growing water sector. Desalinization plants use greenhouse gasses and are highly inefficient. The process of oil extraction also contributes to air pollution by emitting high rates of carbon dioxide. Excess greenhouse gas emissions deplete the ozone and raise global temperatures. Marine life and ocean ecosystems are threatened by urbanization as well. Coastline construction from residential and tourism projects increase the amount of untreated sewage released into the ocean and excess trash in cities. Construction and human activities lead to coastal reef damage and high ocean acidity. Urban and agricultural runoff frequently contaminate waters by releasing untreated waste. thumbJeddah, Saudi Arabia Ground pollution results from both oil drilling and urbanization. The city of Jeddah and other urban areas face problems of heavy traffic that leads to roadside contamination and high carbon emissions. Saudi Arabia's high standard of living encourages fossil fuel based transportation. Saudi Arabia has yet to develop a concrete public transport sector. Therefore, private transportation is a major contributor to air pollution. Moreover, car usage and city life contribute to dangerous degrees of heavy metals in urban soils. These metals are harmful for both humans and plants, as soil contamination inhibits plant growth and are poisonous when ingested.  Deforestation and desertification  Urbanization, expansion of agriculture, and energy consumption contribute to deforestation. Wood is the primary natural resource used in local communities. Studies show that wood is often used inefficiently by people living in rural, traditional housing. Saudi Arabia's growing population increases food insecurity. In turn, forests are cleared at higher rates to make more area for agriculture. Deforestation occurs both legally and illegally. Research on woodland conservation shows that there are few initiatives taking place to slow deforestation. Saudi Arabian desert Increasing global temperatures are projected to accelerate desertification within Saudi Arabia. Desertification will have a variety of impacts on the country's population. Desertification limits residential expansion and prevents small scale farmers from gaining access to lands. The growing industrial agriculture sector contributes to desertification. Mass monoculture disrupts soil processes and depletes the fertile soils on nutrients. The expansion of industrial agriculture misuses the scarce water resources available to Saudi Arabian farmers. This practice depletes naturally fertile land of water, leading to desertification as well.  Environmental action = Renewable energy  Currently, there are no programs encouraging reduced fossil fuel use. Although the government provides subsidies for oil consumption, record breaking oil use has pushed policy towards renewable energy. Peak load, where high energy use creates power outages, is a common fear among the citizens of Saudi Arabia. This anxiety creates further urgency for alternate energy plans to support the population. Mass oil consumption is not sustainable. This realization recently created a new market for renewable energies and further research for cleaner initiatives. Scholars are developing plans to help Saudi Arabia make a transition towards renewable energy. Thus, Saudi Arabia is ranked the 6th worldwide in solar energy potential. Saudi Aramco Logo As opposed to overall energy reduction, the government organization Saudi Aramco wishes to create a solar energy sector. Saudi Arabia has a goal to create 41 GW of renewable energy plants, which would place the country as a leading solar energy exporter. Currently, the country is at 17 MW of solar energy and as a ways to go before reaching the goal. Hydroelectric and water based powers are also being discussed as alternatives to carbon emitting energies. Recently, and particularly in 2019, Saudi Arabia signed a number of agreements to implement mega wind projects as part of its plan to incorporate 5 gigawatt of wind power into its grid. Concerns of inefficiency and expense are holding Saudi Arabia back from converting to renewable energy. Long term costs for environmentally friendly practices are low. However, developers often ignore environmental restrictions during oil expansion. It is possible for Saudi Arabia to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and encourage renewable energy use. Preoccupation on energy security strengthen the movement towards renewable energies. The current wealth from oil abundance and pressure from international organizations could encourage the energy sector to move towards sustainable policy. Natural resources are finite. The transition from voluntary sustainability to mandatory environmental regulation can push Saudi Arabia towards environmentally friendly practices. In the framework of Saudi Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is opt to increase its renewable energy supply by 30%. This is planned to be achieved by partnering Shanghai Electric. The First Saudi Environment Week The Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture organized in 2019 the first Saudi Environment Week. The motto of the event was ‚Äúprotecting our environment for our society‚Äôs well-being‚Äù. The event was organized in 13 Saudi provinces where around 230,715 wild trees were planted.  Environmental policy and programs  King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) Student Services Building The General Authority of Meteorology and Environmental Protection, or PME, is the Saudi Arabian environmental protection agency that handles all environmental policy. Due to a lack of natural Gulf Coast restoration, the Kingdom is implementing a plan to restore the coast from oil pollution. A scientific evaluation of the coastline's toxicity is underway in hopes to rebuild the coastal environment. The government recently created the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), an institute dedicated towards efficient, environmentally friendly energy use. The organization is working towards a city model that only uses nuclear and renewable energies. The National Commission for Wildlife Conservation and Development (NCWCD) is a government sector created for endangered animal preservation. The Saudi government works towards creating designated areas for wildlife protection and natural resource conservation. The parks limit hunting and human development to preserve unique plant and animal species. The goal of the NCWCD is to revive destroyed areas and maintain biodiversity while increasing public environmental education research. Specifically, the NCWCD strives to protect the lava field in Harrat Al-Harrah and the sand sea and cuesta in Uruq Bani Mu'arid. In hope to increase environmental awareness to schoolchildren the government has partnered with the United States to create the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) program.Environmental Cooperation: GLOBE Program: Agreement between the United States of America and Saudi Arabia, signed at Washington, September 30, 2002, with appendices. Treaties and other international act series 02-930. Washington, D.C : United States Department of State. 2013 The goal of the program is to increase international environmental awareness through education and technology. The courses implement environmental issues and solutions into every subject. GLOBE trains teachers and supplies them with instruction materials in both Saudi Arabia and the United States. Students are exposed to the complexity of international environmental issues and the environmental problems stemming from globalization. In order to boost organic agriculture, the Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture allocated an amount of $431,000 to help many farmers go organic. In the 2019th G20 meeting in Japan, Saudi Arabia addressed the issue of climate change by introducing the Saudi efforts to produce and increase the production of renewable energy.  Future Prospects  In 2019, Saudi Arabia started to take serious steps to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels as a source of electricity. Thus, Saudi Arabia planned to build the largest wind farm in the middle east. The farm is planned to be constructed in Dumat Al-Jandal, Al Jawf region, Saudi Arabia. An amount of $500 million is allocated to construct the wind farm with a capacity of 400 megawatts (MW). This power is expected to supply 70,000 homes in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, carbon emission is expected to be reduced by 880,000 tons every year.

After training in Brussels and Amsterdam, he was mainly active in Frankfurt am Main.Jeremias van Winghe at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Life Jeremias van Winghe was born in Brussels in 1578 as the son of Joos van Winghe. His father was a painter who had studied in Italy and had become court painter to Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma in Brussels. The family van Winghe left the Southern Netherlands in 1584, possibly because of the Spanish repression at that time. They established themselves in Frankfurt am Main. Jeremias van Winghe likely started his training with his father.Dorothy Limouze. \\"Josse, Winghe van.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press.

Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 2 November 2016 After spending time in Italy, Jeremias van Winghe established himself in Frankfurt am Main. In addition to portraits he also painted highly finished and beautifully executed still lifes, at a time when this subject matter was still fairly unexplored. He must have been among the first artists to introduce this type of painting to Frankfurt. On marrying Anne Maria Mertens, the daughter of a jeweller, in 1616, he largely abandoned painting in favour of working in his father-in- law's business. Jeremias van Winghe, The glorification of art and diligence and the punishment of gluttony and earthly pleasure at Sotheby's He returned to painting later around 1640, and the break in his artistic activity partially explains the scarcity of his known oeuvre. Work Kitchen interior with a maid preparing meat and gentlemen drinking at a table beyond Jeremias van Winghe's work is not very well known. He started his career as a draughtsman of pen drawings but then developed into a figural and portrait painter. He was also an accomplished still life painter and painter of kitchen scenes. A Kitchen still life in the Historical Museum, Frankfurt, which is signed and dated 'IERAMIA. VAN.WINGE. FECIT.1613', is a key work in establishing a number of attributions to the artist, including A kitchen interior with a maid preparing meat and gentlemen drinking at a table beyond (Christie's, 8 December 2004, lot 30). Both works depict a table laden with food. In the latter painting a maid is busy in a kitchen while in the background a large room is visible with two men and women sitting at a table apparently drinking wine. In the Frankfurt painting a maid is shown pushing away an eager suitor who offers her a silver coin. Through a hatch in the back wall three men can be seen sitting at a table playing backgammon. These kitchen scenes of van Winghe stand in the tradition of the kitchen and market still-life scenes developed by Pieter Aertsen and Joachim Beuckelaer in Antwerp in the 16th century. As in these earlier works, van Winghe juxtaposes a sumptuous display of foodstuffs with a narrative scene in the background. Through the monumental forms of the maid and the dynamic still-life elements his kitchen scenes show van Winghe's familiarity with similarly themed works by the 17th century Baroque still life painter Frans Snyders.Jeremias van Winghe (Brussels 1578‚Äì1645 Frankfurt), A kitchen interior with a maid preparing meat and gentlemen drinking at a table beyond at Christie's Still life Another specialty of van Winghe were banquet type still lifes. An example is the composition A roemer on a silver-gilt bekerschroef, sweetmeats in a silver tazza, langoustines on a plate (dated 1607, at Christie's on 5‚Äì6 July 2007, London, lot 9). This work, which is signed with the initials 'IVW', had previously been attributed to Jacob van Walscapelle. This composition depicts diverse objects, that have been carefully placed on a tabletop and are brightly lit against a dark background. In this work van Winghe demonstrates his technical mastery in the rendering of diverse objects such as a silver tazza with sweetmeats, a silver-gilt German bekerschroef with designs of chameleons, swans and cherubs, surmounted by a half-filled roemer, two langoustines on a silver plate, walnuts, an apple and a wooden box, all placed on a marble-topped table. Van Winghe shows off his magnificent skills of observation in the small details, such as the reflection of the langoustines in the plate, the chameleons which grasp the foot of the roemer and the small chip on the edge of the tabletop. Van Winghe was able to merge these disparate elements into a harmonious composition. This type of still life had no obvious parallel at the time and appears to prefigure the work of artists such as Osias Beert, Georg Flegel and Peter Binoit. The glorification of art and diligence To van Winghe has also been attributed an allegorical scene, depicting virtue and vice referred to as The glorification of art and diligence and the punishment of gluttony and earthly pleasure (At Sotheby's on 29‚Äì30 January 2009, New York City, lot 111). In this composition Virtue is represented on the left by various people engaged in productive and scholarly activities. The Arts are shown in the centre through artists at work such as a sculptor carving a statue, two men sketching and a painter at the easel in the background. Vice is depicted on the right by a multitude of greedy individuals drinking alcohol, a half-naked woman, music playing and large amounts of food. A tazza placed in the middle of the Vice scene in allows van Winghe to show off his skills as a still-life painter. The tazza is very close to the still life composition A roemer on a silver-gilt bekerschroef, sweetmeats in a silver tazza, langoustines on a plate discussed above. Two angels flying overhead embody the rewards and punishments to be meted out to those who are virtuous or given over to vicious pursuits. Portrait of Johann Maximilian zum Jungen The portrait work of van Winghe is less well known. Five portraits by his hand are known. Two of these representing portraits of a couple are recorded but their current location is not known.Jeremias van Winghe, Portrait of Sebastiaan de Neufville\\\\ at the Netherlands Institute for Art History A religious painting of the Crucifixion has also been attributed to Jeremias van Winghe (At Roberts Simon).Jeremias van Winghe, Crucifixion at Roberts Simon ReferencesExternal links * Category:1578 births Category:1645 deaths Category:Flemish Baroque painters Category:Flemish portrait painters Category:Flemish still life painters Category:Flemish genre painters Category:Artists from Brussels ","title":"Jeremias van Winghe"},{"id":"52190806","text":"Ali Ke√Øta (born 1 October 1988) is an Ivorian footballer who plays as a defender for Championnat National 2 club SC Bastia.

Targeted at custom PC building enthusiasts, as well as professions alike, they offer a complete range of water cooling products from blocks to fittings and tubes. EKWB sells products to a number of distributors, and via their own web store. EKWB targets the international market, and uses YouTubers to advertise their products through sponsorship or review samples for reviews.  History  EKWB was founded in 1999 by Edvard K√∂nig, who wanted better thermal and acoustic performance for his personal computer. The company released new versions of their products, resulting in a 40% cooling performance increase from 2006 to 2011. As of 2011 EKWB was one of the three largest personal computer water cooling companies. EKWB works with the overclocking community through forums to better understand the needs of its customers.  Products  EKWB specialises in cooling supplies. Its product line includes: Supremacy CPU water blocks, GPU water blocks, radiators, computer fans, AIO (All-in-one) liquid cooling sets and several accessories.  CPU Water Blocks  Currently EKWB sell a number of CPU water cooling blocks, primarily EK- Annihilator designed for socket LGA 3647, EK-Supremacy sTR4 designed for Socket SP3r2, EK-Supremacy EVO, an evolution of an EK-Supremacy water block, EK-Supremacy MX, a reduced cost version of the Supremacy EVO, and EK-Velocity, their new flagship CPU waterblock, launched 1 October 2018. The EK-Supremacy EVO, EK-Supremacy MX and EK-Velocity have mounting kits available for Intel's Socket T, B, H, H2, H3, H4, R, R3 and R4. (N.B. Socket R2 is also compatible but was only used for certain server processors) and AMD's Socket 754, 939, 940, AM2(+), AM3(+), AM4, FM1 and FM2(+). The EK-Annihilator is required for Intels server LGA 3647 and the EK-Supremacy sTR is required for AMD's EPYC and Threadripper CPU's mounting holes, respectfully. EKWB also sells a range of Monoblocks, a CPU block that is much larger and also cools the motherboard's VRM, ensuring it does not overheat from high load. These monoblocks are based on the EK-Supremacy EVO. Blocks are offered in a number of finishes, with interchange top parts. Blocks are made from copper (or in the Fluid Gaming case aluminium) and either left as bare copper, nickel plated or gold plated. The block's top, as they call it, are made from either nickel plated brass, Acetal (usually black, though white is an option) or plexi tops (both clear and colour tinted).  GPU Water Blocks  EKWB produces both universal GPU water blocks, that only cool the GPU's silicon die itself, and full cover water blocks that cool the GPU, VRAM and VRMs of a graphics card. EKWB makes a number of versions for so called AIB partner cards such as Sapphire, ASUS and EVGA, custom PCB versions of the standard video card, which have different PCB layouts. Full cover blocks are not compatible with different versions, even with the same GPU core, e.g. a block for a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Founders Edition will not an ASUS ROG Strix version of the GeForce GTX 1080. EKWB Universal GPU blocks, marketed as EK-VGA Supremacy for single graphics card setup, and a larger version called EK-Thermosphere, designed for use with more than one graphics card. These blocks only cool the GPU core, and so leave the VRAM and VRMs on a card to be cooled by air, usually. Should a user fail to ensure these vital parts of the card are also cooled, either by placing a fan to direct air over them, or by the use of stick on heat sinks, it's possible for the card to shutdown, or die even, from overheating. Just like the CPU blocks, they offer the blocks in different style offerings in both bare copper and nickel plating, and cover plates made from Acetal or Plexi. EK-VGA Supremacy can also be found with a nickel plated brass top option.  RAM Water Blocks  EKWB offer a range of blocks for RAM DIMM modules, marketed as EK-RAM Monarch. Due to the tight spaces involved in RAM DIMM layouts on modern PCs, the water blocks do not sit directly on the RAM modules, but rather connect to special heat spreaders attached to the DIMM's, they then screw into the RAM block which sits on top and is thermally connected via TIM. They sell these blocks in two and four DIMM versions. They are available as both bare copper and nickel plated copper, as well as in acetal and plexi versions. The heat spreaders are offered in aluminium with black or nickel finishes. Copper versions are also available for the extreme cooling version.  PC Case Fans  EKWB have their own range of fans especially designed for use with PC water cooling radiators. These fans are marketed as being high static pressure and low noise, both factors to be considered for airflow through a radiator. These fans are available in a number of colour combinations, rotational speed and in sizes of 120mm and 140mm, the two main PC cooling standards for enthusiasts.  PC Water Cooling Radiators  EKWB offer radiators in a number of sizes and thicknesses, marketed as CoolStream. They offer their 120mm radiator options as single (120mmx120mm), dual (240mmx120mm), triple (360mmx120mm) and quad (480mmx120mm) fan places in thicknesses of 28mm (SE line) 38mm (PE line) and 60mm (XE line). They offer 140mm radiator options as single (140mmx140mm), dual (280mmx140mm), triple (420mmx140mm) and quad (560mmx140mm) fan places in thicknesses of 28mm (SE Line) and 45mm (CE line). Recently, following the revival of 180mm fans, they also started offering 180mm size rads, in single (180mmx180mm), dual (360mmx180mm) and triple (540mmx180mm) in a thickness of 35mm (WE line). The radiators are made with copper tubes, brass end tanks soldered to the tubes and copper fins in an aluminium housing.  PC All-In-One (AIO) and Water Cooling bundled Kits  EKWB offer their own range of AIO's which use their own parts and are ready to use, or a DIY kit, featuring all the parts you need to build a custom loop out of the box. These ready packaged kits feature all the same parts as you'd get if you buy the parts separately, but all arranged neatly. Marketed as being for beginners to take all the guess work out of getting into custom watercooling.

After this travel, he stayed, married and died in Madrid on April 4, 1590.  Biography  Diego de Torres y Moyachoque was cacique of Turmequ√©, on the Altiplano Cundiboyacense First map of Bogot√° and surroundings, drawn by De Torres y Moyachoque in 1578 Head of the statue in Turmequ√©, honouring Diego de Torres y Moyachoque Diego de Torres y Moyachoque was born in the city of Tunja, former capital of the central Muisca Confederation called Hunza in 1549 from a Spanish conquistador, Juan de Torre(s) and the eldest sister of the previous cacique whose name is unknown, Catalina Moyachoque. Diego de Torres y Moyachoque, cacique de Turmequ√© Catalina was approximately 12 years old when she gave birth to Diego de Torres y Moyachoque.Catalina Moyachoque - Geni He had one sister Beatriz, a half- sister Mar√≠a and a half-brother Pedro de Torre.Diego de Torre y Moyachoque - Geni Beatriz was partner of the former priest of V√©lez, Santander, Francisco S√°nchez Herre√±o, to whom she bore a daughter: Francisca Gonz√°lez de la Nava y Herre√±o.Beatriz de Torre y Moyachoque - Geni He studied at the school for mestizo children of conquistadors set up by Diego de Aquila and later at the Dominican Convent (Convento de los Dominicos) in Tunja, where he was educated in grammar, religion, moral and law. The cacique was also trained in horse- riding and an excellent archer. De Torres y Moyachoque inherited the cacicazgo at age 21/22 in 1571, when his uncle, the former cacique, died. El levantamiento del Cacique de Turmequ√© - Banco de la Rep√∫blica He referred to himself as the cacique cristiano; (Catholic) Christian cacique.Restrepo, 2010, p.21 The Muisca Confederation was mostly conquered during the Spanish conquest of the Muisca from 1537 to 1540, and the town of Turmequ√©, at about from Tunja, was submitted by main conquistador Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada on July 20, 1537. Official website Turmequ√© El legado del cacique Turmequ√© - El Espectador In 1574, the cacique of Turmequ√© had a dispute with the encomendero of the town, his half-brother Pedro de Torres, son of Juan de Torres and his first Spanish wife Leonor Ruiz Herrezuelos.Pedro de Torre - Geni The dispute was about the mistreatment of the indigenous people under the encomienda rules. The cacique of Tibasosa Alonso de Silva, also a mestizo, joined De Torres in his resistance. De Torres y Moyachoque traveled from Cartagena in the New Kingdom of Granada to Spain in 1575 to hand over to the King of Spain a series of demands for the rights of the indigenous people of Turmequ√©. He stranded in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Caribbean and stayed there for almost three years, studying the works of Bartolom√© de las Casas, before traveling on to Madrid, where he arrived in 1577. In Spain, De Torres y Moyachoque befriended Juan Bautista de Monz√≥n and both traveled back to South America, De Monz√≥n being the new visitador of the colony. Here, the Spanish colonisers immediately accused both men to work against the Spanish Crown and convicted De Torres y Moyachoque to death. He promptly fled into the mountains of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense, but later returned to Turmequ√©. In 1578, he made the first map of the Bogot√° savanna, including Santa Fe de Bogot√° and surrounding settlements, the Bogot√° River and Su√© rising over the Llanos Orientales. In the meantime, in 1581, a new visitador had arrived with his delegation from Spain, Juan Prieto de Orellana. Diego de Torres presented himself to the new Spanish rulers and was sent again to Spain. There, he presented his Memoria de los Agravios about the mistreatments of the Muisca to the Spanish King Felipe II in 1584.Restrepo, 2010, p.16 At these encounters, De Torres y Moyachoque was permitted to be seated instead of kneeling, which was common for visitors to the Spanish King.Restrepo, 2010, p.31 He was acquitted of the charges, married Juana de Oropesa, and died in the capital of the Spanish kingdom on April 4, 1590 at age 40. Personajes - Diego de Torres y Moyachoque  El Carnero  The story about Diego de Torres y Moyachoque has been told by Juan Rodr√≠guez Freyle in his famous work El Carnero in 1636, albeit in a different manner. In this book, Rodr√≠guez Freyle, attributed all the conflicts to jealousy over the indigenous women and De Torres y Moyachoque plays a minor part in the story about adultery and corruption.Restrepo, 2010, p.26  Legacy  Although he is commonly viewed as a mestizo who was highly hispanised,Restrepo, 2010, p.19 De Torres y Moyachoque is considered one of the most important Colombian people of the 16th century and in Turmequ√© a monument honouring the Muisca has been constructed.

Today it has nine branches distributed Mexico City which are currently administered by the children of the founders.  History  Gil Romero and Bertha Paredes were a married couple who had a grocery in Aguayo Street in the borough of Coyoac√°n. They offered basic products such as fruits, vegetables and bulk coffee from Veracruz. Gil used to give coffee served in ceramic cups to their neighbors. Later, he decided it would be a good idea to sell the coffee. The couple and their children moved a few blocks away from the grocery and started the business. In 1953, the first coffee shop called El Jarocho opened in Coyoac√°n, between Cuauht√©moc and Allende Streets. Bertha was in charge of the business and Gil was in charge of planting coffee in the northern mountains of Veracruz. Black coffee and coffee with milk were prepared home-style because they did not have an electric coffee maker. Because of the demand for coffee from the neighbors they decided to buy an industrial coffee maker and started to offer more specific drinks such as cappuccino and American style. The menu increased and offered not only drinks but a variety of sweet bread and sandwiches made with Bertha's recipes.  Locations  In 1970, the business was established as coffee bar service in a small place with 4 tables. By the year 1980, it was decided that the crockery used to serve the coffees was impractical and opted to replace it with disposable cups and started the new trend of what is known today as coffee bar. In the early 1990s, the first branch opened giving rise to open another 6 more branches during that decade. Two more branches opened after the year 2000, where the family business is consolidated. In late 2010, the ninth coffee shop opened with not only tables and chairs but with a bonus. With restrooms, parking, lift for persons with disabilities such as toilet for them and Wi-Fi.  Coyoacan branch  The favorite, traditional and most popular branch is the original in Coyoac√°n, the first coffee shop El Jarocho. With no chairs or tables but with a long queue of customers. People enjoy their drink standing in the street or sitting on curbside benches. The Coyoacan branch has also become a tourist spot.

Raman FNA, FASc, FRS, was a distinguished physicist whose achievements in the field of light scattering earned him the 1930 Nobel Prize for Physics. He discovered that when light traverses a transparent material, the wavelengths of some of the deflected light change. This phenomenon, now known as Raman scattering, results from the eponymous effect. *Chandrasekhara Ramaswamy FASc (brother of C. V. Raman) was a noted meteorologist who served as Director-General of the Indian Meteorological Department (1965-1967). He conducted research into the regional and global effects of Indian monsoonal patterns. Second generation *Venkatraman Radhakrishnan FASc (son of C. V. Raman) was a distinguished astrophysicist credited with expanding the field of radio astronomy and for research in pulsars, interstellar clouds and various celestial bodies. *Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar FNA, FASc, FRS (nephew of C. V. Raman) was an Indian American astrophysicist who was awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize for Physics with William A. Fowler \\"for his theoretical studies of the physical processes of importance to the structure and evolution of the stars\\". His mathematical treatment of stellar evolution yielded many of the best current theoretical models of the later evolutionary stages of massive star and black holes. The Chandrasekhar limit is named after him. *Sivaraj Ramaseshan FNA, FASc (nephew of C. V. Raman) was a distinguished crystallographer and successively Director of the Indian Institute of Science (1981-1984) and President of the Indian Academy of Sciences (1983-1985) *Sivaramakrishna Chandrasekhar FNA, FASc, FRS (nephew of C. V. Raman) was a distinguished physicist and pioneer in the field of liquid crystal technology who served as founder-president of the International Liquid Crystal Society. His efforts helped to establish the indigenous manufacture of liquid crystal displays in India. In 1977, he and his co-workers discovered the columnar phase of liquid crystals. *Sivaramakrishna Pancharatnam FASc (nephew of C. V. Raman) was a distinguished optical physicist who, in 1956, discovered the properties of what is now known as the geometric phase (sometimes known as the Pancharatnam phase) for polarized beams passing through crystals. *Chidambara Chandrasekaran FASc (nephew of C. V. Raman) was an accomplished demographer and biostatistician. In 1949, together with W. Edwards Deming, he devised the Chandra-Deming formula to estimate numbers of vital events by comparing results from two different systems. He was Director of the Demographic Training and Research Centre, Mumbai (later renamed as the International Institute of Population Sciences) from 1959-1964, and conducted several landmark demographic studies for the Indian government, the World Bank and the United Nations.

It was enacted on July 29, 2016 when President Obama signed then Senate Bill 764 (S.764). While the law is officially termed A bill to reauthorize and amend the National Sea Grant College Program Act, and for other purposes, it evolved over time into \\"the legislative vehicle for a measure concerning bioengineered food disclosure\\". The bill was crafted by Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI). The \\"GMO labeling bill\\" was introduced by its sponsor, Sen. Roger F. Wicker (R-MS), cosponsored by Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK), and passed Senate and House in June 2016. The law overturned relevant state laws such as Vermont's GMO labeling law that had called for strict and transparent GMO food labeling in Vermont after July 1, 2016. Labeling of GMO food is mandated in at least 64 countries, including most European countries, China, Russia, Japan, Brazil, South Africa, and Australia.  Contents  The bill was created to \\"establish a national bioengineered food disclosure standard\\", whereby bioengineered food (commonly referred to as genetically modified organism or GMO food) is defined as \\"food that has been genetically engineered in a way that could not be obtained through conventional breeding or found in nature\\". It charges the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish a national mandatory bioengineered food disclosure standard within two years with certain provisions: * Food from an animal cannot be declared bioengineered on the basis that animal has been fed bioengineered food. * The minimum amount of bioengineered food present in food needs to be defined by the USDA to carry the bioengineered label. * The disclosure of bioengineered food can be a text, a symbol, or a digital or electronic link according to the discretion of the food manufacturer. * USDA is asked to conduct a study to see whether challenges exist in regard to access to electronic information. * In certain cases a telephone number or internet site are allowed as a means of disclosure. * Restaurant food and \\"very small\\" food manufacturers are excluded from disclosure requirements. * States (and its subunits) are prohibited from establishing or continuing to require other GMO labeling practices. * Food cannot be claimed to have no bioengineered food when there is no disclosure label. * Certification by USDA's National Organic Program \\"is sufficient\\" for a claim that bioengineered food is absent. The law indicates that a QR code could suffice as a GMO label  USDA responsible for GMO labeling  While the FDA is responsible for protecting and promoting public health through the control and supervision of food safety, the agency holds the position that \\"the use of genetic engineering in the production of food does not present any safety concerns for such foods as a class\\", and , as there is \\"an absence of reliable data indicating safety concerns\\" with GMO foods as a class, voiced no opposition for USDA having the responsibility of regulating GMO food labeling. The agency commented that the bill has language that may allow GMO material to escape labeling: the bill requires labeling if the food contains \\"genetic material\\", but that may exempt secondary products like oil, starches, sweeteners, or proteins derived from GMO substrates. The agency questioned the specificity of the definition of bioengineered food when it would not apply to GMOs that could also be achieved by \\"conventional breeding\\". The FDA has also voiced some concerns about food information being presented in electronic codes. As the details of the law need to be worked out, USDA established a working group by September 2016 \\"to develop a timeline for rulemaking and to ensure an open and transparent process for effectively establishing this new program, which will increase consumer confidence and understanding of the foods they buy, and avoid uncertainty for food companies and farmers\\". History Public Law 114-216 was passed after previous attempts to introduce a national GMO labeling bill had failed. It was fast-tracked without debate or committee review. The original bill S. 764 - \\"A bill to reauthorize and amend the National Sea Grant College Program Act, and for other purposes\\" - had nothing to do with food and stalled after having passed the Senate. Hollowed out of its content it was replaced with a bill to defund Planned Parenthood. This bill was then replaced with a bill creating to outlaw state-level GMO labeling and setting a voluntary GMO labeling bill. When this bill failed, the S. 764 husk was used to rush through the present bill, just in time before the Vermont GMO food labeling requirement would have been activated on July 1. Previous attempts to enact a national GMO labeling law included H. R. 1599 in 2015 ‚Äì the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015. It was a proposed legislative amendment to the United States Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The act passed the House of Representatives on July 23, 2015 but failed in the Senate. An earlier version of the bill had been originally introduced as H. R. 4432 in 2004. and attempted to regulate food labeling specifically in view of the introduction of GMO food in the United States. Proponents' view Katie Hill, White House spokesperson, lauded the bill, \\"(t)his measure will provide new opportunities for consumers to have access to information about their food\\". Proponents have argued for a comprehensive labeling law that applies nationwide instead of a \\"patchwork\\" approach state-by-state. They also feel that a proposed bill will enhance agricultural biotechnology. Proponents argue that approved GMO food has undergone extensive testing, is \\"safe\\" and that basically labeling is unnecessary. Labeling may discourage consumers to use GMO products when such a choice may be irrational. A lot of consumers express fears that have not been substantiated by science. The bill is backed by Grocery Manufacturers Association, Monsanto, and other large food and beverage corporations. Opponents' view While GMOs are present in 75-80% of food Americans consume and have been termed \\"substantially equivalent\\" to the corresponding non-GMO foods by the FDA, consumers believe that they have a right to know what is in their food. Thus, a 2013 poll by the New York Times indicated that ninety-three percent of American consumers would like to know if their food has been genetically modified. The primary objection to the bill is that manufacturers have the option to use electronic codes in lieu of clear readable labels placed directly on the food package, which they argue hides the information. The bill allows the use codes such as the QR code as a form of labeling, and opponents see this as impractical as well as discriminatory. They argue that, for instance, low-income families may not be able to access the information. Critics also oppose the fact that no fines or penalties are included when companies do not follow the law. Additionally, they are concerned that the bill's stipulation that labeling will be required when foods contain genetic material from genetic modification may exempt many of the highly processed foods and ingredients that are usually derived from genetically-modified crops (such as many seed oils, high-fructose corn syrup, and some refined starches and sweeteners), because such foods are often sufficiently refined that no genetic material remains in them. Senator Stabenow dismissed this interpretation when it was advanced by the FDA. Because clear and accessible labeling is not mandated, some opponents have called this bill and its predecessors the \\"DARK act\\" as in \\"Deny Americans the Right to Know\\" or \\"Keep Americans in the DARK\\".

The National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) has said they will maintain a legal reserve of 30% of each settlement in the corridor, and will allocate most settlements for preservation according to the sustainable management plan. History Marina Silva, Minister of the Environment, signed the decree creating the corridor on 11 March 2005. The purpose is to restore and preserve the natural environment, facilitating the spread of plants and animals, while encouraging socio-economic development. An initial investment of R$300,000 included funding from the United Nations Environment Fund and the Ministry of the Environment's National Forest Program. This was to be applied to environmental studies and technical assistance to the settlements in the corridor, and to development of a sustainable management plan that encourages activities other than logging so as to avoid deforestation. It was the first officially recognized ecological corridor, the second being the Caatinga Ecological Corridor, created in April 2006. In 2012 inspectors from the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio), an analyst from the Ipanema National Forest in S√£o Paulo and military police officers conducted Operation Transitum in the corridor. They seized illegally hunted animals, weapons and traps. They also found evidence of illegal lumber operations and farming.

It follows the story of Aisholpan, a 13-year-old Kazakh girl from Mongolia, as she attempts to become the first female eagle hunter to compete in the eagle festival at Ulgii, Mongolia, established in 1999. The film was shortlisted for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature but was ultimately not nominated. It was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Documentary. Content TIFF in 2016 The Eagle Huntress follows the story of Aisholpan, a 13-year-old Kazakh girl from Mongolia, as she attempts to become the first female eagle hunter to compete in the eagle festival at Ulgii, Mongolia, established in 1999. She belongs to a family of nomads who spend their summers in a yurt in the Altai Mountains and their winters in a house in town. The men in her family have been eagle hunters for seven generations, and she wants to follow in their footsteps. With her father Nurgaiv's help, she learns how to train golden eagles, and then captures and trains her own eaglet. Although she faces some disbelief and opposition within the traditionally male sport, she becomes the first female to enter the competition at the annual Golden Eagle Festival. She ends up winning the competition, and her eaglet breaks a speed record in one of the events. After the competition, she takes the final step toward becoming an eagle hunter by traveling with her father to the mountains in the winter to hunt foxes, braving snowy conditions and extreme cold. After some initial misses, her eaglet successfully kills its first fox and she returns home. The film's dialog is in Kazakh; the narration is in English. Music The film's soundtrack features the original song \\"Angel by the Wings\\" by Sia, which was released worldwide on December 2, 2016.; ; and \\"'Angel by the Wings' ‚Äì Single\\", Apple Itunes, accessed March 8, 2017 Release The Eagle Huntress premiered at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival, where it was purchased by Sony Pictures Classics for the US and Altitude Film Distribution in the UK. Afterwards, international distribution was handled by Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions. Following the film's premiere, co-executive producer Daisy Ridley agreed to add narration, comprising approximately five minutes' total time in the 87-minute film. Director Otto Bell said of Ridley, \\"Like so many other theatergoers around the world, I was blown away by Daisy's recent portrayal of an empowered female protagonist [Rey in The Force Awakens]. I'm thrilled she'll be bringing that same energy to supporting a real-world heroine who is also on an epic journey to win victory in a far away land.\\" Reception The documentary was a New York Times Critics Pick and an LA Times Critics Pick. Chief Film Critics at The New York Times, Manohla Dargis and A. O. Scott, called the film \\"a bliss out\\" and \\"a movie that expands your sense of what is possible\\", respectively. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 94% approval rating based on 126 reviews with an average rating of 7.41/10. The website's critics consensus states: \\"Effectively stirring and bolstered by thrilling visuals, The Eagle Huntress uses its heartwarming message to fill up a feature that might have made for an even more powerful short film.\\" Metacritic reports a 72 out of 100 score based on 20 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Criticism Some reviewers and researchers felt that the documentary overstated the amount of opposition Aisholpan faced as a female eagle hunter and that the early promotion of the film included an ethnocentric and distortive description of the Kazakh eagle hunting culture as being one of \\"ingrained misogyny\\"(IMDb description for initial 7 months from film's premiere). After historical evidence and facts were published about nomadic steppe women participating in training eagles to hunt from antiquity to the present day, the filmmakers corrected early reports placed in media outlets that Aisholpan was \\"the only\\" woman in the world hunting with an eagle. A 2014 article by a consultant on the film, Dennis Keen, suggests that women in Aisholpan's region faced a \\"knee-jerk reaction based on a traditionalist understanding of society and the sexes,\\" such that their achievements \\"are dismissed by nearly every prominent falconer in Central Asia\\" because they represented \\"a serious disturbance in how things are done.\\" Aisholpan has described the opposition she faced in her own words. Despite Dennis Keen's above-noted assertion, in a March 8, 2014 article entitled \\"–û–Ω “Ø—à—ñ–Ω–¥–µ “õ–æ–Ω–¥—ã—Ä“ì–∞–Ω “õ–æ–ª“ì–∞ “õ—ã—Ä–∞–Ω\\" (https://egemen.kz/article/29988-on-ushinde-qondyrghan-qolgha-qyran) by Suleimen Mamet for Egemen Qazaqstan news, eagle huntress, Makpal Abrazakova, said: \\"Realizing my enthusiasm, my father deliberately took me to the eagle hunters on the slopes of Alatau [Qazaqstan] and introduced me to the eagle hunters. I was blessed by such elders as Tleubek Esimbek, Aben Toktasynov, Seitzhan Kodekov. Seeing commitment and talent in me they bestowed me with an eaglet/baby eagle which they thought/predicted could become a best hunting eagle in the future.\\" And in a March 4, 2014 article entitled \\"Falconry Tournament Tests Ancient Skills\\" (https://astanatimes.com/2014/03/falconry- tournament-tests-ancient-skills/) by Asset Kalymov for The Astana Times news, two of the men mentioned in the above-noted article as having blessed Makpal's eagle hunting career were described as: \\"famous berkutchis Aben Toktasynuly and Seitzhan Kodekov whose efforts in the early 1990s helped revive this Kazakh tradition.\\" Thus, the men Dennis Keen cites as objecting prominent eagle hunters are only a subset of prominent eagle hunters and the very men who blessed Makpal's engagement were elders integrally important to the resurrection of eagle hunting tradition in Kazakhstan during post-Soviet rule! In addition, although Dennis Keen served as a voluntary film consultant to Otto Bell, he failed to discover the existence of other Kazakh eagle festival participant, Akbota Bagashar, or Gulaida Zhorobekova, an eagle (and other birds of prey) falconer of Kyrgyzstan. Both of whom also preceded Aisholpan Nurgaiv in terms of female engagement in eagle falconry in Central Asia. In an article dated February 26, 2013 by Nadezhda Plyaskina called \\"The Basic Instinct\\" with photo by Roman Egorov. Url: https://time.kz/articles/sport/2013/02/26/osnovnoj-instinkt Akbota Bagashar noted to have competed at the \\"Sonar-2013\\" festival, near Nura; a 3 day competition with 40 competitors and involved shirga (lures) and live prey. In that article she said she began going out on hunts with her grandfather as a child and went on her first hunt with her own eagle at age 15. At the 2013 festival in Nura she was awarded a prize by virtue of being the only female competing. Layman researcher, Meghan Fitz-James of Vancouver, B. C., Canada, along with Dinara Assanova of Women of Kazakhstan NGO have been working to deepen the research into female engagement in eagle hunting in Central Asia. Meghan Fitz-James is the first Westerner to bring the existence of Gulaida Zhorobekova to light to English language readers and has a created a post about her on Facebook at this link https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10155684529801277&id;=668731276. Meghan Fitz-James is currently (2020) working to develop a documentary which she claims will \\"reveal covered up evidence that bypassed every single veracity fact-checker for 'The Eagle Huntress' \\"documentary\\" since day one.\\" (found in comment sections under many of her Instagram photos featuring Makpal Abdrazakova). She notes that her discovery involved deep investigation and took her 2.5 years to discover. Legacy Aisholpan stated her desire to study medicine and become a doctor. The filmmakers made Aisholpan and her family \\"profit participants\\" in the documentary and established a fund to help pay for Aisholpan's higher education. They also donated the $3,000 prize money they received from winning Best Documentary at the Hamptons International Film Festival to this fund.

At the onset of the Vietnam War, US pilots had carte blanche over Vietnamese airspace. During the initial stages of the conflict, poorly equipped Vietnamese air defense forces were unable to shoot down high altitude US aircraft using World War II-vintage guns. When they asked for assistance, their chief ally, the Soviet Union, was initially apprehensive but eventually decided to supply S-75 Dvina (reporting name SA-2 Guideline) SAM systems. About 1000 Soviet specialists arrived Vietnam in April 1965. Generous and massive Soviet military aid, consisting of SAMs, MiG fighters, and Kalashnikov rifles, enabled Vietnam to become a formidable belligerent. In the initial stages of the conflict, US combat pilots referred anti-aircraft missiles as Russian-made \\"telephone poles.\\"Russian missiles to guard skies over Vietnam However, the S-75 missile gained attention in 1960 when it was used to shoot down U-2 of Francis Gary Powers overflying the Soviet Union, and then again when, during Cuban Missile Crisis, a S-75 system shot down another U-2 (piloted by Rudolf Anderson).Steven J. Zaloga (2007). Red SAM: The SA-2 Guideline Anti-Aircraft Missile. Osprey Publishing. p. 9. The situation changed drastically after the introduction of sophisticated Soviet Anti-aircraft systems. 7658 missiles and 95 S-75 Missile Systems were delivered between 1965 and 1972. Most of the systems were extensively deployed in the periphery of the Hanoi-Haiphong area and US intelligence and reconnaissance flights detected the employment of S-75 systems almost immediately by 5 April 1965. It was in August 1965 that first high altitude SAMs were fired against the USAF over Vietnam; out of four F-4 Phantom II jets encaged in the first action, three were knocked down. During the first few days US pilots were helpless but soon they crafted tactics to dodge anti- aircraft missile systems. The aggressive missile evading maneuvers and tactics were jokingly refereed as \\"Dancing with Death.\\" The pilots generally had only few seconds to react and failure meant certain death. To avoid being hit, pilots would employ high-G turns, low level flying, and turning toward the sun (to spoof infrared seekers). American commanders were surprised and impressed that Vietnam, deemed to be a pastoral state, could operate such advanced SAM systems. Americans not only devised tactics but decided to suppress the threat caused by Soviet-supplied anti-aircraft systems. They created special units armed with AGM-45 Shrike anti-radiation missile designed to home in on hostile anti-aircraft radar, and special units, named Wild Weasels, to use the new weapon systems and tactics. The launch platforms of these missiles were the A-4 Skyhawk, A-6 Intruder, F-105 Thunderchief, and F-4 Phantom II aircraft. Soviet specialist upgraded S-75 systems on periodic basis and improved its resistance to jamming.

This fungus was found originally collected in Tierra del Fuego National Park, Argentina. The Costa Rican species G. lindbladii was added to the genus by these authors in 2007. Globuliciopsis is of uncertain familial placement in the Polyporales. Description The fruit bodies of Globuliciopsis are pale brown, thick crusts that adhere closely to their substrates. The spore-bearing surface is smooth, while the subiculum is compact with a brownish colour. Globuliciopsis has a monomitic hyphal system (containing only generative hyphae), and the hyphae are hyaline (translucent) and lack clamp connections. Cystidia are absent from the hymenium, but there are hyphal ends and dendrohyphidia. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are arranged in a relatively loose palisade, measuring up to 100 ¬µm long. They usually have two, but sometimes three to four sterigmata. Spores are roughly spherical, smooth, hyaline, and feature a slight wall thickening.

He served in World War I (as a part of the Medical Reserve Corps) in the 317th Infantry. He served in France with the rank Captain and ended his military service as a major. After the war, he worked in Philadelphia, founding an emergency relief organization and the North Penn Hospital (1954). Early life Boston was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to parents Charles A. Boston and Julia Sands on March 10, 1891. Frank was the youngest as he had an older brother, named Edgar, and an older sister, named Mae. Frank was educated and raised entirely in Philadelphia before entering Lincoln University. After graduating from college, he attended Medico Chirurgical College. Boston finished his medical studies in 1915 and received certification in 1916, where he specialized in surgery. Frank began his medical career as an intern in Roosevelt Hospital. Boston's first confrontation with the media was in May 1916, where he had been criticized by the local coroner's office after the death of a young boy. The boy had come in after a car accident with a massive head injury and because the hospital lacked a X-ray machine, Boston took it upon himself to drive the injured boy to the nearest equipped hospital. After the X-ray Boston performed on the boy, however, the child did not survive. In the article Frank defends the actions of his colleagues and him: A short while after Boston took a position as surgeon in Mercy Hospital, where he would remain at employ for majority of his career. He even opened his own medical practice in Lansdale. Military service In 1917, the United States joined World War I and the entire nation was in a buzz to join the effort. After the declaration of war with Germany, many African-Americans were turned away from the local recruiting stations. Unprepared for a large scale conflict, the United States Army had only four black regiments, and many commanders would not allow mixing of blacks and whites in their units. Also, the black regiments themselves were not trusted to be sent to Europe, as many of the higher ups possessed a lack of confidence in black soldiers as fighters. Fort Des Moines Provisional Army Officer Training School had been opened for training African-American men as there had been a huge influx of African-American volunteers and a petition was erected by the students of Howard University. However, there was still some discontent at the facility as many soldiers found that he had been unfairly assessed for merely being black. When Boston answered the military's call for physicians he was immediately given the rank, First Lieutenant in the Army Medical Reserve Corps. Like all the African-American recruits, Lt. Boston was sent to Fort Des Moines for medical training at the Medical Officers Training Camp. After completing his training, Lt. Boston was assigned as a medical officer with the 317th Engineers Regiment of the 92nd Division. Before leaving for France, Lt. Boston spent additional time in Camp Sherman, Ohio, where his abilities and rigor were so well recognized that he was promoted to Captain. When arriving at France, Captain Boston found a large amount of work on his plate. The 317th Engineering Regiment was the other option for black citizens wanting to enlist into work. Most African-American soldiers had been assigned to noncombatant engineer units that performed dangerous and hard jobs of digging trenches, forming roads, and fortification against the Germans. Captain Boston spent his time in France busy taking care of sick men and those heavily injured from building, as the Germans were becoming more aggressive in late 1918. Later, Captain Boston would display his extraordinary skill as a surgeon. After the conclusions of the war, Captain remained at his commission in the Medical Reserve Corps. While there Cpt. Boston was in communication with author W.E.B Du Bois. Four surviving letters exist to confirm the correspondence. When the war ended Du Bois sought out and interviewed many African American soldiers for a scheduled book on their experiences. In a letter Du Boise sent to Captain Boston on April 16, 1919: There is evidence that Du Bois eagerly sought the chance to interview Cpt. Boston as indicated in an earlier letter. At the time Cpt. Boston was living in 813 N. 16th Street, Philadelphia, and in one of his letter to Du Bois, he replied: It is unknown whether an actual occurred between the two men, but there was a constant correspondence, as Du Bois's interest in the African-American effort in World War I increased. As a result of speaking with Cpt. Boston and other African American soldiers, Du Bois had found discovered that there was a large amount of racism very prominent in the U.S. Army. He noted, especially, how many African-Americans were discouraged from joining the military and were not often credited for their accomplishments as compared to white soldiers of the same rank. In 1919, Boston was given the rank of Major and he was even a member of the Association of Military Surgeons. Major Boston was discharged in the later months of 1919. Career When Boston left the military he returned to Lansdale, Pennsylvania, to continue work on his medical practice in Philadelphia county. Boston placed a large emphasis in providing medical assistance and education towards the community. He had been a member of the American Medical Association, the Philadelphia County Medical Society, the International College of Surgeons, and the National Medical Association. At the 1926 annual convention, Boston was listed as chairman of the Committee for Gynecologists and General Surgeons in the Journal of the National Medical Association and proceeded to open stations at Mercy Hospital for well-known surgeons to operate. Boston was often involved in Veteran fundraisers and dedicated work toward Veterans of Foreign Wars. In 1934, Boston opened his own medical establishment called Elm Terrace Hospital, which would later be renamed North Penn Hospital in 1954. Boston continued his work at Mercy Hospital, participating in various clinical lectures throughout the 1930s and was credited for it in the Chicago Defender. Boston formed a First Aid Emergency Squad in Lansdale, dedicating many hours to that venture. Personal life Boston never married. Death In 1960, Boston died in at the age of 69 in Einstein Medical Center. Upon his death, his many peers from both the hospital and the Emergency Relief Squad came to sing at his grave. Boston was buried in Lansdale, Pennsylvania. The First Baptist Church in Lansdale, Pennsylvania established a memorial consisting of a sculpture made by S.K. Miller.

She has also led creative writing workshops at Casa de la Cultura in Nuevo Le√≥n, Mexico. She has participated in several academic conferences at universities such as UNAM, Brown University, Texas University, among others.  Published works  Maria de Alva has been a finalist for the Lara de Novela award of Spain twice. Her first nomination was in 2004 for her book A trav√©s de la ventana (Through the Window) and in 2009 for her novel Antes del olvido (Before Oblivion). Her book A trav√©s de la ventana, describes how Ida, who is the main character, together with her family are trying to escape not only from war during the Mexican Revolution, but also from German traditionalism and exile in Mexico. They were the first Jewish family to come to Monterrey, Mexico. This book was a finalist because it represents the cruelty, reality, necessity, hope and fear while searching for a better life. It also portrays issues like family, sickness, pain, exile and memory. The novel uses three types of narrators, a diary in the first person, a recollection in the second person and a third person that tells most of the story. Her most recent book Lo que guarda el r√≠o (What the river Keeps) was inspired by the deaths of two students from Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey, where she works, due to narco violence. Also it has to do with the disaster brought upon the city of Monterrey by Hurricane Alex in 2010. The author's purpose is to show through characters of different social classes how violence and nature force interactions among them even if in the end each separate once again.

At age 16, he entered the Academy of San Carlos in Mexico City. Moyers went back to his native town in 1957 to work with Master Erasto Cort√©s Ju√°rez at the Fine Arts Workshop of the Autonomous University of Sinaloa. There he principally did stage sets for the University Theater Group of Sinaloa. He managed the workshop until 1969, when political repression forced him to leave Sinaloa due to his left-wing ideology. He moved back to Mexico City, and in that same year, Mario Orozco Rivera introduced him to David Alfaro Siqueiros. Moyers worked with Alfaro Siqueiros on the project of the Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros, and even though he was part of this project only on its final stage, he would be highly influenced by the artist during the rest of his life. Moyers remained under Siqueiros's guidance at La Tallera, (also known as Siquerios's workshop), until he died on 1974. In 1985 Moyers settled in the State of Hidalgo, and governor Guillermo Rossell de la Lama invited him to paint the walls of the Government Palace of Hidalgo.

Shlenker (August 14, 1936 ‚Äì April 23, 2003) was an American businessman. His management/ownership of a series of professional sports teams was marked by both success and controversy. Early life and career Shlenker was born in Monroe, Louisiana. His family moved to Houston two years later. He graduated from St. John's School in Houston, and attended Tulane University, but dropped out without graduating. Shlenker met Roy Hofheinz, the owner of the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball and the Astrodome. Shlenker began promoting non-sporting events held at the Astrodome. In 1966, Shlenker and Allen Becker founded Pace Management Company, which focused on event promotion. In 1975, the Astros hired Shlenker as their president. He fired Spec Richardson, the team's general manager, and hired Tal Smith. Shlenker became a part-owner of the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1982. In May 1985, he bought the NBA's Denver Nuggets for $20 million. He reached an agreement with the city of Denver to renovate the McNichols Arena.

Location and access The museum is situated in Anafartalar Cad. 58 in Balƒ±kesir. It is open everyday but Monday from 8:30 to 17:00 hours local time. Background The original building on the site of the museum was a mansion built for Giridizade Mehmet Pasha, treasurer of the Karasi Sanjak, in 1840. When the first mansion burned down in 1900, a new mansion was built by the treasurer's grandson, Halil Pasha. During the Turkish War of Independence, the building served as the meeting place for the local nationalist forces. The day after the occupation of Smyrna on May 15, 1919, prominent citizens of Balƒ±kesir gathered in this mansion and formed Kuva-yi Milliye to fight against the foreign troops. It also served as headquarters of the II Corps and Ali Hikmet Ayerdem. From 1946 on, the building was used as the municipal hall of Balƒ±kesir. The municipal council decided in 1985‚Äì86 to redevelop the building into a museum to honor the efforts of Kuva-yi Milliye. According to a protocol signed between the municipality and the governorship of Balƒ±kesir, the right of the building's usage was transferred to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism indefinitely. Restoration works started after the appointment of a museum director. The museum opened on September 6, 1996. Following revision and reorganization of the building and the exhibits, the museum reopened on December 26, 2008. Museum The museum is housed in a two-story Ottoman building with on each floor.

He was known for his humanitarian efforts in both situations. In 2008 his name was included on a plaque in the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London, commemorating seven British diplomats \\"‚Ä¶who by their personal endeavours helped to rescue victims of Nazi racial policy\\". Early life Ogilvie-Forbes was born on 6 December 1891 in Edinburgh, son of an Aberdeenshire landowner. He was educated at The Oratory School, Beaumont College, Bonn University and New College Oxford. At Bonn, Ogilvie-Forbes studied modern languages, becoming fluent in French and German. In 1914 he joined the Scottish Horse Yeomanry, was wounded at Gallipoli and twice mentioned in Dispatches. In 1916 he was promoted to Captain and became ADC to Lieutenant General Sir Frederick Stanley Maude the Commander-in-Chief, Mesopotamia and served on the General Staff. Early diplomatic career Ogilvie-Forbes joined HM Diplomatic Service in 1919London Gazette, 23 April 1919, p. 327 and early postings included Denmark, Finland, Yugoslavia and Mexico (1927‚Äì30). Ogilvie-Forbes served as the charg√© d'affaires to the Holy See (1930‚Äì32) and then as Counsellor to Embassy in Baghdad (1932‚Äì35). Ogilvie- Forbes was described as a \\"brilliant diplomat\\" who was a favourite protege of Sir Robert Vansittart, the Permanent Undersecretary at the Foreign Office 1930-37. Spain 1936‚Äì1937 At the outbreak of the civil war in July 1936 several embassies, including the British, evacuated to Hendaye. Ogilvie-Forbes was appointed charg√© d'affaires in Madrid, which was then a war zone governed by the Republicans. The British ambassador, Sir Henry Chilton, chose not to return to Madrid, which he regarded as too dangerous. Ogilvie-Forbes was on vacation in Scotland when the war began, but he chose to return to Madrid, and as the most senior British diplomat took charge of the embassy. Upon landing in Spain, he was provided with ammunition for his revolver, and arrived in Madrid on 15 August 1936. British policy during the Spanish Civil War was officially that of non-intervention, but many believed at the time that this was a false image and subsequent opening of official records has shown the British government's support for Franco from the start. In contrast to this, Ogilvie-Forbes set out firstly to be as impartial as possible, and secondly to cultivate good relations with the differing factions within the Republican side because of the opportunity it provided for humanitarian aid and assistance to refugees from both sides of the conflict. The appointment of the devout Roman Catholic Ogilvie-Forbes led to charges by left-wing journalists that he was pro-Nationalist, but his impartiality and humanitarianism soon silenced these claims. The Spanish Foreign Minister, the Socialist Julio √Ålvarez del Vayo later recalled in his exile that Ogilvie-Forbes was intelligent man with \\"strong human kindness\\", who despite the fact that Roman Catholic Church had blessed Franco's \\"crusade against Communism\\", did his best to be neutral. Ogilvie-Forbes witnessed first hand the terror waged by Spanish Communists and anarchists against the right in Madrid, but predicted if the Spanish Nationalists won the civil war, then the terror from the right against the left would be even worse. During his four and a half months running the embassy in Madrid the city was torn by the violence of the chaotic reign of terror within and the shelling by the Spanish Nationalist's army from the outside. On 28 August, he reported that there was an average of 70 murders per night by the Communists with the public being encouraged to view the bodies displayed as \\"like the game in a shooting party\\". In October‚ÄìNovember 1936, the Nationalist Army advanced up to the gates of Madrid, and on 7 November the Spanish government moved to Valencia. As a prelude to the assault on the city that began in December, Madrid was bombed daily, and which led Ogilive-Forbes to complain of the \\"wanton cruelty\\" of the Nationalists whose \\"terror bombing\\" killed innocent civilians. During this period of extreme stress, Ogilvie- Forbes engaged in his favorite pastime of playing his bagpipes to ease his nerves. The historian Tom Buchanan wrote of Ogilvie-Forbes: \\"He had no interest in the competing ideologies in Spain ‚Ä¶ and never lost sight of the fact that the conflict represented above all, private suffering on an immense scale which it was within his power ‚Äì in however small a way ‚Äì to mitigate.\\" As the face of Britain in war-torn Madrid, many journalists met him and came to like the \\"jovial, compassionate, bag-pipe playing Scotsman, who kept the embassy against the odds, and who refused to serve a full Christmas dinner while madrile√±os went hungry\\". Towards the end of 1936 the Foreign Office was keen for Ogilvie-Forbes to close the embassy in Madrid, whilst acknowledging \\"that in the present welter of agony he feels a personal call to continue as long as possible his work of mercy, and that he cannot leave without doing violence to his conscience.\\" On 1 January 1937 after the Republican government moved out of Madrid, Ogilvie-Forbes was instructed to move the Embassy to Valencia.The Times, 11 May 1937, p.12 Ogilvie-Forbes thought the order to move the embassy from Madrid to Valencia was \\"cowardly and dishonourable\\". Soon after that he was appointed as Counsellor to the British Embassy in Berlin. By January 1937 British officials had helped in the evacuation of some 17,000 refugees. When Ogilvie-Forbes received his KCMG in May 1937 for his services in Spain, he pointed out in a letter to Anthony Eden that it was in recognition of all his colleagues who had helped him in Spain \\"often in terribly cruel circumstances\\". During this period, Ogilvie-Forbes exchanged letters on a weekly basis with Vansittart, who kept him well informed of developments in Germany. Berlin 1937‚Äì1939 Ogilvie-Forbes was appointed Counsellor to the Embassy in Berlin in early April 1937. Sir Neville Henderson, the new ambassador, arrived shortly afterwards. It was unusual to replace an ambassador and his second-in-command at the same time especially in an embassy of such significance. Ogilvie-Forbes and Henderson had differing attitudes towards Hitler and the Nazi regime, and their personal relationship was strained from the start. Ogilvie-Forbes wrote that Henderson was \\"rude and domineering\\". In the various degrees of approach to Appeasement, Henderson certainly shared the views of Neville Chamberlain, and as far as possible he dealt with Chamberlain directly, regularly bypassing the Foreign Office. Henderson was appointed in the hope that he might befriend Hitler and thus help to moderate the latter's behaviour towards Britain. As late as February 1939 Henderson wrote \\"If we handle him (Hitler) right, my belief is that he will become gradually more pacific. But if we treat him as a pariah or mad dog we shall turn him irrevocably into one\\". From August 1937 onward, in the power struggle that developed between Henderson and Vansittart, Ogilvie-Forbes tended to back the latter, which made relations with the former very difficult. On 14 September 1938, Ogilvie-Forbes warned Ernst von Weizs√§cker, the State Secretary of the Ausw√§rtiges Amt, that the proposal of Neville Chamberlain to allow the Sudetenland to be incorporated into the Reich showed how far Britain was willing to go to save the peace, but if Germany kept up its current negative attitude, then the result would be war. In speaking to Weizsacker, Ogilvie-Forbes was saying essentially the same thing as Henderson, but in far stronger and blunter language. In October 1938, Ogilive-Forbes wrote to Sir Oliver Harvey, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax: \\"In the major political business of this Embassy I have always been ignored. My views or participation are neither asked for nor wanted nor do I see the papers (and by no means all of them) until long after action. It is also very difficult to work for one who is so often excited, rude and domineering over trivial and [sensitive? (text unclear)] matters and all the more discouraging because I have been constantly loyal to both his personality and his policy, as is my duty.\\" By mid 1938 it was clear that Henderson was a very sick man, and in October he had to return to London and take five months leave for treatment for the cancer from which he died in 1942. During this time Ogilvie-Forbes was in charge of the Embassy. He had a much more pessimistic view of Hitler than Henderson and this was reflected in his dispatches back to the Foreign Office. Ogilvie-Forbes shared the widespread feeling in Britain that the Treaty of Versailles had been too harsh on Germany and he had supported the Munich Agreement on the grounds that the Sudetenland should never had been included in Czechoslovakia in the first place. However, unlike Henderson, Ogilvie-Forbes believed that the Nazi regime had foreign policy goals that went well beyond revising the Treaty of Versailles and were aimed at winning Germany the \\"world power status\\" that she had sought in the First World War. In the work involving the implementation of the Munich Agreement as a joint Anglo-German-Franco-Italo commission had the task of deciding what districts of the Sudetenland were to join Germany, Ogilvie-Forbes became increasingly tired \\"of the Germans' arrogant and dictatorial actions, and their blatant disregard for the letter and spirit of Munich.\\" On 11 October 1938, in one of his last instructions before he left Berlin, Henderson ordered Ogilvie-Forbes to accept the German definition of where the new German-Czechoslovak frontier should be, adding in that he hoped \\"that the Slovaks [would] stick it to the Czechs\\". Ogilvie-Forbes by contrast tried as much as possible to include majority Czech districts within Czecho- Slovakia as Czechoslovakia was renamed. By 26 October 1938, Ogilvie-Forbes had counted over 300 violations of the Munich Agreement as the Germans sought to claim districts of the Sudetenland that were, in fact, majority Czech with the aim of making Czecho-Slovakia economically nonviable. He complained that the frontier claimed by the Germans was \\"cunningly\\" drawn to cause economic chaos as \\"almost all of the main arteries of Bohemia and Moravia must now traverse territory occupied by the Germans\\". As the Sudetenland was turned over in stages to Germany in October‚ÄìNovember 1938, Ogilvie-Forbes complained that the German authorities were expelling Jews from the Sudetenland in violation of the Munich Agreement, which stated all of the people living in the Sudetenland had the right to stay. On 17 November 1938, Weizs√§cker presented Ogilvie- Forbes with a quasi-ultimatum claiming a district of Czecho-Slovakia which as the latter noted as \\"populated by about 6,000 Germans and 50,000 Czechs\\". Ogilvie-Forbes wrote that to agree to this \\"would appear to be truckling to an unreasonable demand and out of accord with the terms and the spirit of the Munich agreement\\" while also writing \\"to refuse would be regarded by the Germans as contrary to His Majesty's Government's policy of Anglo-German rapprochement as recorded at Munich\\". The Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, ordered Ogilvie-Forbes to accept the German demand despite the way it clearly violated the Munich agreement, which stated that only districts of the Sudetenland that were 50% ethnically German or more based on the outdated Austrian census of 1910 (rather than the more recent Czechoslovak census of 1930) were to go to Germany. In the months that followed, his appraisal of the situation was bleak, emphasising that Hitler could not be trusted and \\"had unlimited aims of world domination and an ‚Äòinsensate‚Äô hatred of Britain... that appeasement could never succeed... that the German economy was solely directed towards military ends... and Hitler could only be removed after a military defeat, Britain would have to choose between war and surrender.\\" He could see no possibility at all of Goering (whom he knew personally) leading a movement against the F√ºhrer, and dismissed the idea of an internal German revolt to overthrow the Nazis. On 21 October 1938, Ogilvie-Forbes attended a speech by the Propaganda minister Josef Goebbels in Hamburg, which he summarised as: \\"filled with a glorification of force and of its successful employment by the Nationalist-Socialist leadership.\\" It has been argued by the Canadian historian Bruce Strang, that during the time of Henderson's absence, Ogilvie-Forbes, was able to have a significant effect on British Foreign policy, as he wrote: \\"It was not a coincidence that the decisive turn in the Cabinet's perception of Hitler occurred while Sir George Ogilvie-Forbes temporarily headed the Berlin Embassy, as he helped to undermine Chamberlain's often inaccurate views, and to create the climate of moral revulsion and the heightened sense of danger in which the Cabinet operated.\\" This \\"moral revulsion\\" was perhaps most keenly conveyed by the barrage of strongly worded reports concerning the plight of the Jews in Germany sent by Ogilvie-Forbes. In a letter to the Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax after Kristallnacht (10 November 1938), Ogilvie-Forbes described how he and members of his staff witnessed the looting and destruction of Jewish property. The attacks, he wrote, started at a given hour, targeted with uncanny precision Jewish shops and buildings and ended on the word of Goebbels who condoned what had been done. Towards the end of his letter Ogilvie-Forbes wrote \\"I think the murder of Herr vom Rath by a German born Polish Jew has only accelerated the elimination of the Jews which has for long been planned... It has let loose the forces of mediaeval barbarism... I can find no words strong enough in condemnation of the disgusting treatment of innocent people and the civilized world is faced with the appalling sight of 500,000 people about to rot away in starvation.\\" He pointed out that this is not just a national problem but also a world problem. On 13 November 1938, Ogilvie-Forbes reported after Kristallnacht many German Jews \\"are wandering about in the streets and parks afraid to return to their homes\\". Ogilvie-Forbes also reported with disgust that none of the perpetrators of the Kristalnacht were going to be punished and that the Reich government had imposed a 1 billion Reichmark fine on the entire Jewish community in Germany to punish the Jews for the violence inflicted on them. Since most of the Jewish homes and businesses had been destroyed in the Kristalnacht, Ogilvie-Forbes predicted the 1 billion Reichmark fine was going to drive the German Jewish community into utter destitution. Ogilvie-Forbes was in contact with members of the German opposition, who provided intelligence such as a copy of Hitler's secret speech to a group of 200 German journalists on 10 November 1938 saying he wanted more bellicose media coverage to prepare Germany for war. Ogilvie-Forbes also noted that in the secret speech Hitler called for Britain to be presented as \\"public enemy number one\\" and he kept hearing rumors that Hitler was planning to renounce the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. In this regard, Ogilvie-Forbes noted the German media was entirely Anglophobic with France being spared any abuse, which led him to the conclusion that Hitler was trying to sever France from Britain, so it could take on the latter alone without confronting the former. When Hitler gave the departing French ambassador Andr√© Fran√ßois-Poncet a medal at their last meeting in October 1938 for his work in improving Franco-German relations, Ogilvie-Forbes saw sinister implications in this. Amongst Ogilvie-Forbes's sources were Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin, Fabian von Schlabrendorff, and the mysterious man with the surname Ritter whom Ogilive-Forbes called K (as in knight, the equivalent English word for Ritter). Just whom K. was remains a mystery as the files from the British Embassy state his surname was Ritter (a common surname in Germany) and nothing else. K. reported that he had seen a plan to have the Luftwaffe prepare a bombing campaign to set London ablaze. At the same time, Ogilive- Forbes noted the increasing anti-British tone of the German media, evidence that Hitler had given orders to increase the size of the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine (which suggested German foreign policy was indeed turning anti- British), and information that Germany was moving over to a \\"total war\\" economy. Ogilivie-Forbes portrayed Hitler as a leader who was barely sane, if at all, and suggested he was eminently capable of a \\"mad dog act\\", a sudden, reckless act of aggression that would plunge the world into a world war. Lord Halifax was known as the \\"Holy Fox\\" due to his cunning and his devotion to the Church of England, and Ogilvie-Forbes's picture of a brutal Nazi regime running roughshod over innocent German Jews disturbed Halifax's Anglican conscience. At a meeting of the Foreign Policy Committee on 14 November 1938, Halifax cited Ogilvie-Forbes's dispatches as a reason for a tougher line with Germany. At a meeting of the cabinet, only the War Secretary Leslie Hore- Belisha supported Lord Halifax's proposals for an \\"economic offensive\\" to keep the Balkans out of the German economic sphere of influence with Chamberlain; the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir John Simon; and the President of the Board of Trade, Sir Oliver Stanley, all condemning Halifax's plans as \\"economically unsound\\". The information from K. about the purported plan to raze London had more impact on British policy with Sir Alexander Cadogan writing in his diary about Chamberlain's reaction: \\"Glad he takes it seriously.\\" At a meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defense called to discuss the information from K., Lord Halifax's proposed staff talks with the French and propaganda around the world to counter the anti-British propaganda campaign coming from Germany as Goebbels was attacking Britain not just in Germany, but all around the world. Though Chamberlain dismissed the possibility of a surprise German bombing attack on London as unlikely, the Home Secretary, Sir Samuel Hoare, generally regarded as an ally of Chamberlain, came out in support of Lord Halifax. Whilst Halifax did not prevail in this debate, the fact that he won over several cabinet ministers to his side suggests the direction the cabinet was moving in. In a dispatch to London on 6 December 1938, Ogilvie-Forbes quoted from Mein Kampf to argue that for Hitler Germany could not obtain \\"world power status\\" without first winning Lebensraum (\\"living space\\") in Russia. Ogilvie-Forbes argued that with the Reich rearmed and in possession of Austria and the Sudetenland, what he was hearing from sources in Berlin was \\"that Herr Hitler is about to embark on the third stage of his programme, namely expansion beyond the boundaries of the territories inhabited by Germans. How exactly this is be achieved is the object of much speculation. One thing is certain: Nazi aims are on a grandiose scale, and there is no limit to their ultimate ambitions\\". Some sources were telling Ogilvie-Forbes that Hitler was planning to attack the Soviet Union in 1939 to establish \\"an independent Russian Ukraine under German tutelage\\", and afterwards Germany would expand into the Balkans and seek an \\"outlet on the Mediterranean via Italy\\". Other sources were telling Ogilvie-Forbes that Hitler was thinking about turning west in 1939 to \\"liquidate\\" France and Britain before Germany fell behind in the arms race. Ogilvie-Forbes quoted one German official as saying to him that Hitler was still undecided whether to turn west or east in 1939, but \\"it is the profound conviction of almost every thinking German that the tiger [Hitler] will jump soon\\". Ogilvie-Forbes further reported that Hitler regarded the Munich Agreement as a diplomatic defeat as what he wanted was a war to \\"smash\\" Czechoslovakia, not an agreement to hand over the Sudetenland. He wrote that his sources were telling him that Hitler had wished he had taken a \\"stronger line\\" at the Munich conference, was now \\"abusing his moderate counselors for their pusillanimity\\" and had \\"dubbed all his generals cowards\\" for advising him not to attack Czechoslovakia in September 1938. Sir William Strang of the Foreign Office's Central Department wrote after reading the dispatch of 6 December: \\"This dispatch is a plain warning which ought not to be ignored. Unless we can rapidly and effectively increase our immediate powers of resistance, the expectation of the life of the British Empire may be shorter than we are perhaps ready to suppose\\". In another dispatch, Ogilvie-Forbes reported that the Nazi regime was upset that British spending on defence had not decreased after the Munich Agreement as expected, and that Hitler was planning to increase his defence spending in order to win the arms race and allowed Germany to dominate Europe. On 2 January 1939, Ogivlie Forbes endorsed a report from the military attache Colonel Noel Mason-MacFarlane. He supported Mason-MacFarlane's conclusion that another war was imminent even if he could not predict for certain what Hitler would do in 1939 \\"what is certain is that the military and civilian resources of the country are prepared for an emergency\\". Mason-MacFarlane wrote he believed that given the current political and economic problems faced by the Reich, Hitler would almost certainly resort to \\"some foreign excursion\\" as the way out and that the German economy and military were on \\"full throttle\\" for war. Ogilvie-Forbes also endorsed Mason-MacFarlane conclusion that Lord Halifax should work to strengthen Anglo-French ties and to encourage the French to improve their ties with their allies in Eastern Europe, saying that a combination of Britain and France was the only thing that could deter Hitler from choosing war. Finally, Ogilvie-Forbes approved of Mason-MacFarlane's warning that Hitler would probably strike one of the states of Eastern Europe, such as Czecho-Slovakia, Poland or the Soviet Union in order to exploit their natural resources and people before turning west to strike at France and Great Britain. On 3 January 1939, Ogilvie-Forbes engaged in what Ascher called an act of personal appeasement towards Henderson, when he wrote in a dispatch that the Wehrmacht was so overwhelmingly powerful that there was now nothing Britain could do to stop Germany from dominating Eastern Europe, and that British diplomats should make more efforts \\"to cultivate Field Marshal G√∂ring and the moderate Nazis with a view to their exercising a restraining influence on the extremists such as Ribbentrop, Goebbels, and Himmler who at present have the ear of Hitler\\". In the same dispatch, he wrote that G√∂ring \\"is so devotedly loyal to his chief that I see no indication whatever of his leading a movement against the F√ºhrer\\". Ascher wrote that this dispatch is so completely at odds with the rest of the dispatches Ogilvie-Forbes sent between October 1938-February 1939 that it is hard to guess what Ogilvie-Forbes was thinking when he wrote it. Ascher argued that the most likely explanation was that the dispatch of 3 January was meant to appease Henderson when he returned to the embassy in Berlin, as Ogilvie-Forbes knew that Henderson would disapprove of what he was writing, as indeed he did. In a dispatch in January 1939, Ogilvie-Forbes warned that Hitler was planning to turn the Franco-German friendship pact of 6 December 1938 into a non-aggression pact, which would leave Britain alone as the Reich's main enemy in western Europe. Afterwards, he predicted that if what he was hearing about Hitler's plans for expandingd Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine was true, that Germany would launch an air-naval offensive against Britain with the Luftwaffe to bomb British cities into the ground while the Kriegsmarine would sink the British Merchant Marine, causing a famine since Britain's population exceeded its agricultural capacity. In this regard, Ogilvie-Forbes stated that he kept hearing rumours that Hitler was planning to seize the Netherlands to provide air bases closer to Britain. Ogilive-Forbes ended by suggesting there was no resistance movement in Germany that was powerful enough to overthrow the Nazi regime, but Hitler could be overthrown externally. In the Berlin Embassy's annual report for 1938 Ogilvie- Forbes noted that at the beginning of the year it was estimated there were 15,700 prisoners at Dachau of whom over 12,000 were Jews being subjected to harsh treatment. In the concentration camp at Buchenwald there were 30,000 Jews who were in many cases treated with brutality. He warned that unless Hitler was stopped by war, \\"extermination [of the Jews] in Germany can only be a matter of time.\\" Ogilvie-Forbes argued on several occasions that the British Government might persuade Hitler to use the one billion Reichmark fine, levied against the entire community of German Jews after Kristalnacht to punish them for having allegedly provoked the pogrom against themselves, to fund Jewish emigration, an action that he believed could really save Jewish lives. The government ignored this suggestion. He was also keen to point out that Nazi anti-Semitism was symptomatic of Hitler's frame of mind; that it was Hitler who was personally conducting the campaign against the Jews. The American historian Abraham Ascher, himself a German Jew who fled the Third Reich, wrote that there was a real sense of personal empathy with the sufferings of German Jews in Ogilvie-Forbes's dispatches that Henderson never displayed. Unlike Henderson, Ogilvie-Forbes attached far greater significance to Nazi antisemitism. After Hitler gave his \\"Prophecy Speech\\" to the Reichstag on 30 January 1939, Ogilvie-Forbes wrote the \\"extermination\\" of the Jews in Germany \\"can only be a matter of time\\". Ogilvie-Forbes wrote that antisemitism in Germany was \\"not a national, but a world problem, which if neglected, contains the seeds of a terrible vengeance\\". As regards helping individual Jews to escape from the Nazis, in his position as a senior diplomat Ogilvie-Forbes could not be seen to be \\"bending the rules\\". However, he was able to help an acquaintance, Klaus Neuberg and secure the release of his son and three nephews from Sachsenhausen, and the subsequent move of eight of the family to New Zealand. This was organised through Captain Frank Foley, the passport control officer in the embassy, whom Ogilvie-Forbes supported, unofficially, in his work to enable thousands of Jews to escape. A New Zealand man, John Schellenberg in a letter of 14 March 2004 to the British historian Sir Martin Gilbert stated that Ogilive-Forbes assisted the efforts of his parents to leave Germany. Schellenberg's father, Rudolf Schellenberg, was the Jewish service manager of a local Ford dealership in Berlin, and Ogilive-Forbes was a customer. Schellenberg fils told Gilbert: > \\"One day in 1938, Forbes came to my father and advised him that it would be > well to take his family out of Germany as soon as possible. Further, Forbes > undertook to provide papers for any country in the British Empire that my > parents choose. So it came about that they chose New Zealand, papers were > duly provided and the three of us arrived safely in Wellington on 28 March > 1939. My father's parents, two of his uncles and an aunt, and their spouses, > my mother's widowed mother, and one of her sisters-all were lost. There is > no doubt in my mind that Forbes must have arranged the New Zealand > documentation through Foley and I have in my possession the original of a > letter approving our entry into this country, written by the responsible > Government authority. It is addressed to the Passport Control Officer, > British Embassy, Berlin.\\" Ogilvie-Forbes's dispatches had an impact on British foreign policy decision- making in the winter of 1938-39 as Lord Halifax who during this period was consistently the member of the Chamberlain cabinet toughest on Germany, used the dispatches from Berlin to argue in cabinet that Britain needed a harder line with the Reich. In part because of the dispatches written by Ogilive- Forbes. Britain announced a \\"guarantee\\" of France, the Low Countries and Switzerland in February 1939, warning that any German aggression against those states would automatically lead to war with the United Kingdom. When Henderson returned to Berlin on 13 February 1939, his first act was to assemble the senior embassy staff to castigate Ogilvie-Forbes for what he had written in his dispatches during his absence. Henderson announced that henceforward all dispatches from the embassy in Berlin would have to conform to his views and that any diplomat who disobeyed this directive would be fired from the Foreign Office. In a lengthy dispatch Henderson sent on 6 March 1939, he denounced almost everything that Ogilvie-Forbes had written during his absence. From that time until August, Ogilvie-Forbes was largely excluded from the decision- making process. In August 1939, American journalist Louis P. Lochner showed the American diplomat Alexander Comstock Kirk the text of the Obersalzberg speech, calling for the coming war in Poland to be conducted in the most inhumane way possible and he gave Genghis Khan as a role model, asking him to transmit back to Washington, but Kirk was not interested. On 22 August 1939, Loucher contacted Ogilvie-Forbes and gave him the text of the Obersalzberg speech, which he reported back to London the same day. Shortly after 1:30 am on the night of 27‚Äì28 August 1939, Ogilvie-Forbes was woken up by the Swedish businessman Birger Dahlerus who was acting as a self-appointed peace-maker with a message that he had a peace plan from Hermann G√∂ring to prevent the Danzig crisis from turning into a war. On the morning of 28 August 1939, when Henderson returned from the Reich Chancellery where he met Hitler to discuss the Dahlerus peace plan, a meeting that did not go well, Ogilive-Forbes warned Dahlerus that his plan to stop a war was unravelling. On 30 August, Ogilvie- Forbes phoned Baron Bernardo Attolico, the Italian ambassador to Germany, and unaware that the Forschungsamat (\\"research office\\") was listening in, stated everyone in the British Embassy was waiting for London to reply to Dahlerus's peace plan, saying that the longer they waited, the better, as he hoped to drag out talks to resolve the Danzig crisis into the fall, which would weaken the chances of Germany invading Poland, as the autumn rains would turn the unpaved Polish country roads into mud. On 31 August, Ogilive-Forbes phoned Dahlerus to tell him that he heard that Ribbentrop had told Hitler that Britain would do nothing if the Reich invaded Poland, an assessment that he felt more war more likely than not. Later that same day, 31 August 1939, on Hendeson's orders, Ogilive-Forbes took Dahlerus to meet Jozef Lipski, the Polish ambassador to Germany, to show him his peace plan. The meeting went poorly with Lipski objecting to the Germanophile Dahlerus's rant against Poland as Dahelerus accused the Poles of being the instigators of the Danzig crisis by refusing to allow the Free City of Danzig to rejoin Germany and in addition to demanding that the Polish Corridor return to Germany as well. Finally \\"to stop this ghastly business\\" as he called it, Lipski claimed he could not understand Dahlerus's German and sent off to dictate his peace plan to his secretary. After Dahlerus left the room, Lipski turned to Ogilive- Forbes, and expressed great anger at British policy, saying that as a Pole, he did not want to be harangued by some Swedish amateur diplomat whom he had never heard of before; he definitely would not agree to hand over parts of Poland at the urging of this amateur diplomat; and finally he stated he found it astonishing that the British were really taking Dahlerus seriously. Lipski expressed his belief that the best way of stopping the Danzig crisis from turning into a war was a \\"united front\\" of Britain, France and Poland to deter Germany, and the British should not be talking to somebody like Dahlerus, who clearly was an amateur diplomat operating way beyond his level of competence. Ogilvie-Forbes agreed with Lipski that Henderson should not had been talking to Dahlerus, but Ogilive-Forbes was as the historian Donald Cameron Watt called him a \\"dyed-in-the-wool professional diplomat\\", indeed so professional that he did not criticise his chief in front of a foreign diplomat. On the morning of 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland, and Henderson sent Ogilive-Forbes to hear Hitler give his speech before the Reichstag claiming that it was Poland that just attacked Germany. On the morning of 3 September 1939, at about 7:43 am, Ogilive-Forbes made a phone call to Dahlerus that once again was listened into by the Forschungsamat saying that: \\"Henderson would be going over at 9 am and would request a reply by 11 am; if that was not forthcoming, they would ask for their passports and all would be over\\". Dahlerus, who was still convinced as late as the morning of 3 September 1939 that he could stop World War II, phoned Ogilive-Forbes at about 10:30 am, asking the British to give more time to their ultimatum that Henderson had submitted to Hitler that morning, saying he had a plan to have G√∂ring fly to London where he would prevent the German-Polish war that began two days before from becoming a world war. Ogilive-Forbes, who knew that Britain would be at war with Germany in half an hour's time, as the ultimatum was set to expire at 11 am, in an attempt to politely brush off Dahlerus told him that Britain would consider his plan, but required proof that Germany was acting in complete sincerity. Ogilive-Forbes then put Dahlerus on the phone to Lord Halifax at 10:50 am. Lord Halifax in turn told Dahlerus that if Germany wanted to prevent a world war, all the Reich had to do was agree to the British ultimatum to cease the war against Poland at once, and since Hitler had no intention of doing that, he was just wasting his time with his latest peace plan. At 11 am, the ultimatum expired, and Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain announced on the BBC that Britain was now at war with Germany. Later diplomatic career After leaving Berlin soon after the outbreak of war, Ogilvie-Forbes was sent as Counsellor to the British Embassy in Norway, but had to leave almost immediately in company with the ambassador and the royal family when the Germans invaded. From 1940‚Äì1944 he was Minister to CubaLondon Gazette,16 April 1940,p.2241 and then from 1944‚Äì1949 Ambassador to Venezuela.London Gazette, 6 October 1944, p.4591 Upon his arrival in Havana, the devout Catholic Ogilive-Forbes found himself the object of a personal attack by the conservative Catholic newspaper Diaro de la Marina which charged that his efforts to help refugees in the Spanish Civil War, both Republican and Nationalist, proved that he was not a good Catholic. The editor of Diaro de la Marina, Jos√© Rivero, was an admirer of General Franco, and like other supporters of the Nationalist cause regarded any sort of assistance to the \\"Red Republicans\\", even refugees, as a sign of lack of a proper Catholicism. In late 1940, Ogilvie-Forbes reported to London that Cuba was \\"a country where a teeming population live in abject poverty side by side with a wealthy, ostentatious and thoughtlessly selfish minority who pay practically no direct taxation and who manipulate without scruple the Government to their own interests\\". He was not impressed with the Cuban politicians whom he wrote \\"...90 per cent of whom are completely ignorant of the duties entrusted to them and who have attained their positions by questionable means\\". He also noted that the Cuban economy revolved mainly upon selling sugar abroad, especially to the United States, and he expressed worries that a fall in the sugar price would cause \\"an internal revolution ending in some form of Communism\\". In December 1941, Cuba under strong American pressure declared war on the Axis powers, which led to the closing of the German and Italian legations whose diplomats Ogilvie-Forbes had competed against. In June 1942, Ogilvie-Forbes negotiated an agreement that led the Royal Air Force (RAF) use the air base at San Antonio de los Ba≈Üos to conduct anti-submarine patrols over the Caribbean. Later in 1942, he negotiated another agreement to let the RAF use the San Juli√°n Air Base for anti-submarine patrols. Much of his time was taken up with defending the interests of British and Canadian insurance companies in Cuba (Canada had no diplomatic representation in Havana with the British legation representing Canada until 1945). Cuba sought to tax the insurance companies' profits abroad, which the British charged violated the 1937 Anglo-Cuban Treaty of Commerce, a dispute made complex by the Cuban claim that the treaty did not cover the Canadian companies. At least 40% of the \\"British\\" people living in Cuba during the war were actually Canadians, and as such Ogilvie-Forbes frequently had to cable Ottawa as well as London. Reflecting Cuba's semi-colonial relationship with the United States, a contingent of Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents were assigned to the American embassy in Havana, whom Ogilvie-Forbes noted operated as if Cuba were part of the United States, as he described the FBI in Cuba as \\"a kind of Gestapo under the clock of the Cuban police\\". He reported that officials from the American embassy had told him that Cuba was America's \\"stepchild\\" and that Britain should \\"KEEP OUT from nosing into Cuban affairs\\". The impression Ogilvie-Forbe had was the Americans regarded Cuba as being in their own sphere of influence and resented any British \\"meddling\\" in Cuba. Owing to British \\"total war\\", traditional British exports to Cuba such as cloth, coal, whisky, and pharmaceuticals had almost ceased during the war. By 1943, Ogilive-Forbes reported to London \\"our trade with Cuba has lost very heavily to the Americans, not only in commodities, but also in goodwill and the possibility of recovery\\". The Cuban president Fulgencio Batista wanted to upgrade relations with Britain from the legation level to the embassy level, but owing to the discrimination in Cuba against people from the British West Indian islands, who were overwhelmingly black, London refused. In a dispatch from London, Ogilvie-Forbes was told that it was not possible to upgrade relations until the \\"scandalous\\" mistreatment of British West Indians in Cuba ended first. The issue took up much of his time as he wrote in 1943 that it was \\"rather pusillanimous\\" to assume \\"that British West Indians will renounce their British citizenship and it also ignores the growing movement to deny certain rights either to nautralised Cubans or to Cubans of foreign parentage\\". In another dispatch, he warned that pro-democratic \\"sentiment is not carried to the extent of doing justice to British West Indians, still less, of giving a fair chance to earn a living\\". In the summer of 1943, Ogilvie-Forbes wrote after visiting Guantanamo that it was \\"indescribable\\" the living conditions of British West Indians who were working at the American naval base there and that \\"there were further cases of arrests of British West Indians\\" by the Cuban police. J. Petinaud, the president of the British West Indian Democratic Association, which represented the immigrants, gave Ogilvie- Forbes a dossier detailing the beatings of West Indian immigrants by the Cuban police together with the murder of least one. Ogilvie-Forbes in a dispatch to the Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden, urged that \\"strong language\\" be used in diplomatic notes to the Cuban government, but also noted \\"the means of reprisal were practically Nil\\" while \\"previous experience\\" has proved that the United States would not be involved on Britain's side. In his last dispatch from Havana before leaving in May 1944, Ogilive-Forbes wrote that Cuba's contribution to the Allied war effort was only superficial and he predicated that British interests in Cuba would continue to suffer owing to American economic domination. The war caused a massive increase in the price of sugar, and Ogilvie-Forbes predicated that the war-time prosperity had put off \\"the day of reckoning\\" for Cuba at least for some time. However, he noted: \\"There is no doubt that these benefits [of the war] were not properly distributed, and that the Cuban people will one day have cause to regret the growing disparity of wealth amongst the various classes of the community\\". In 1944, his appointment to as the British minister in Venezuela was regarded as a promotion. Venezuela was the world's third largest oil producer, and was as a consequence, was always a major concern for British diplomacy. When Britain upgraded relations with Venezuela from the legation to the embassy level, Ogilvie-Forbes became the first British ambassador in Caracas. At the San Francisco conference, which founded the United Nations, the Venezuelan Foreign Minister, Caracciolo Parra P√©rez, announced that the Venezuela did not recognize the border with British Guiana (modern Guyana), leading Ogilvie- Forbes to predict to Eden a return to the long running border dispute, which had been supposedly settled for good in 1899. In the same dispatch, he drew Eden's attention to the article in the newspaper El Pais by R√≥mulo Betancourt of the Acci√≥n Democr√°tica (AD) who argued that Venezuela should lay claim to the Netherlands Antilles and the British colony of Trinidad, both of which were off the coast of Venezuela. Ogilvie-Forbes described Betancourt as a firebrand nationalist who greatly resented the power of the oil companies in his country who had once belonged to the Venezuelan Communist Party, but who was now friendly with the British press attache in Caracas. During his time as ambassador, he witnessed the coup of 18 October 1945 and the tumultuous three years of El Trienio Adeco when Venezuela became a democracy for the first time under President R√≥mulo Betancourt. He was very much a supporter of the Acci√≥n Democr√°tica government, writing in December 1945 about the Venezuelan delegation to the newly founded United Nations that \\"they are as good as be expected from this well meaning revolutionary government\\". Despite the vast wealth generated by the oil industry, most Venezuelans were illiterate as the government had never established an educational system. El Trienio Adeco saw the first attempt to ensure that the pardo (mixed race) majority of the Venezuelans received some benefits from the oil industry like establishing a mass educational system, measures that Ogilvie-Forbes approved of. In his Political Report for 1945, he presented a very hostile picture of the former presidents Eleazar L√≥pez Contreras and Isa√≠as Medina Angarita. About the latter, he wrote \\"his capacity for leadership befuddled by riotous living was completely cowed\\". About the AD government, he wrote: \\"the new government are on the whole young and inexperienced, but sincere in their efforts for reform. They have undertaken the formidable task of cleaning up in a few months the corruption of centuries, and while they will probably not have entire success, they are present honest and are deserving of sympathy in their attempt to improve the living condition of the Venezuelan people.\\" In 1946, President Betancourt visited Guatemala, where he praised his fellow \\"revolutionary\\", President Juan Jos√© Ar√©valo. During his visit, Betancourt supported the Guatemalan claim to the British colony of British Honduras (modern Belize) while also laying claim to British Guiana, arguing that in his view the Atlantic Charter made European control of any territory in the New World illegal. Ogilvie-Forbes tried to defend Betancourt by arguing that his speech had been promoted by Ar√©valo and did not reflect his true feelings towards Britain. The supportive attitude taken by the ambassador towards Betancourt was not shared by his superiors in London. Oglive-Forbes's favorable view of the trienio government put him at odds with the American ambassador, Frank P. Corrigan, who was openly hostile to the social democratic AD government. Victor Perowne of the American Department of the Foreign Office wrote: \\"Oglive-Forbes has reported consistently favorably on the Revolutionary Government and harshly on its predecessors. There is some room for doubt whether these views do not require some qualification, at any rate they are not those of the U.S. ambassador, a man with a far wider and deeper experience of Venezuela than Oglivie-Forbes\\". In response, Oglive-Forbes reported the deposed Medina Angarita government had been \\"notoriously supine in its attitude towards the interests of German firms established in Venezuela\\". Perowne wrote on the margin of Oglivie-Forbes's dispatch: \\"Our and (Corrigan's) experience in Venezuela is longer than that of Oglivie-Forbes who has shown himself a envout√© of the charms of the present government-one of least, of whose members made a most unfavorable impression in London, barely a year ago\\". In June 1946, one of the oil companies operating in Venezuela, the Royal Dutch Shell company, requested that Ogilvie-Forbes have a warship sent to Venezuelan waters for \\"its calming effect on the European staff\\", a request that was refused. Retirement and death On retirement Ogilvie-Forbes farmed his estate of Boyndlie, Aberdeenshire, was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant for Aberdeenshire, and became actively involved in various local charities and cultural organisations. He was a member of the Scottish Council for Development and Industry and the Catholic Council of Great Britain. For a short time he supported the Scottish National Party and was then designated by the 4th Scottish National Assembly to negotiate with the UK Government on the principle of self-government for Scotland under the Scottish Covenant Association Scheme of 1950. He died of a heart attack in 1954 at the age of 63. Family Ogilvie-Forbes married Clare Louise Hunter in 1921 and had two children, Lt Colonel Thomas Drostan Ogilvie-Forbes, Royal Engineers, who died in 1946 at the age of 24, and Christine Mary Margaret Ogilvie-Forbes (Mrs. Brose) who worked in Hut 8, Bletchley Park (1939‚Äì1945). One of his half- brothers, Air Vice Marshall Neill Ogilvie-Forbes OBE was Assistant Chief of Air Staff (Intelligence) 1950‚Äì52 and a half-sister Marion Wilberforce was one of the first eight women pilots to join the ATA in January 1940.

The facility is run together by the municipality of Bydgoszcz and the local government of Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship. HistoryBernardine Monastery Library= Origins of the actual institution date back to the creation of the Bernardine library in 1488, which stood at the location of today's Church of Our Lady Queen of Peace. In 1591, Wojciech Jƒôzyk from Sambir, then Bernardine guardian, expanded the monastery and built a new brick room for the library. The monastery had organised manuscripts into several disciplines: * Theology, including works by Catholic authors and representatives of the Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation; * Philosophy, with works from ancient authors, scholastics, Renaissance philosophers (Jan of Stobnica, Micha≈Ç Falkener); * History, encompassing Roman classics works. In addition, the library had books dealing with law, geography, mathematics, astronomy, medical science, mining and metallurgy. Stocks comprised also historical incunables, colorfully decorated by Bernardine brother Aleksi, famous for his adorning of antiphonary books. Most of the books come from purchase or donations, some have been brought by monks travelling abroad (Dionizy Szyjka, Jan of Ko≈õcian, Melchior Dƒôbi≈Ñski, Wawrzyniec of S≈Çupca and others). In 1574, the starost of Bydgoszcz Jan Ko≈õcielecki secured the maintenance of the library by assuring a fixed amount of income from a local sawmill. In 1631, Jan Synodoniusz of Pako≈õƒá, dying chaplain of the Church of the Holy cross in Bydgoszcz (now gone), bequeathed to the library a sizable collection of books. Likewise the son of Andrzej Rozra≈ºewski, founder of the Poor Clares monastery, gave many Venetian incunables. Other well-known donators include: governor of Kcynia Piotr Czarnkowski (ca 1620), governor of Solec Antoni Grasi≈Ñski, Bydgoszcz Mayor Wojciech ≈Åochowski or town's woman El≈ºbieta Szychowa. The library, its adjoined scriptorium and the Bernardine academic study of philosophy helped to develop a broader intellectual environment in the city. One of the famous professor of the philosophy was Bart≈Çomiej of Bydgoszcz, a bernardine monk who conducted fruitful scholarship work at the local monastery, issuing the first Latin-polish dictionary in 1532. Several written chronicles written at the beginning of the 17th century by Jan of Ko≈õcian describe this fertile scholar period. The library luckily survived the violent times of Polish history, such as the Swedish invasion (1656-1660) or the Great Northern War (1700-1721). In 1810, only 2400 volumes were left in stock; at the dissolution of the monastery in 1829, the library, then under the authority of the Head of the city police, was moved to the nearby House of Loreto's order and at the demolition of the monastery in 1838, the books have been placed in a compartment behind the main altar of the Bernardine Church of Our Lady Queen of Peace. They have been then transferred to the cathedral where they survived until 1907. At the request of the German authorities, these old volumes have been moved to the stock of Bromberg's Municipal Library. Shortly before the reintegration of Bydgoszcz to the Polish territory in 1920, ecclesiastical authorities placed these old volumes to the Church of the Holy Trinity, for fear of losing them in the hands of the Germans leaving the city. =Municipal Library= Municipal library 1910 City library was established on October 1, 1903: located initially in a building on the corner of Bernardy≈Ñska and Jagiello≈Ñska streets, it has then been housed from 1904 to 1906 at Gda≈Ñska Street 27 (at the plot where stands today Tenement Carl Meinhardt). First library resources were offered by German private donators: historian Friedrich Ludwig Georg von Raumer, editor Heinrich Kruse and German scientific societies affiliated to the German Society of Arts and Sciences in Bromberg, mainly Historical Society from Bromberg - Netze District (). The first director of the institution was Georg Minde-Pouet, who quickly demonstrated a real ability to acquire the funds needed for the maintenance of the library. He had the building expanded, acquiring a wing on Jana Kazimierza street. When the building and its resources moved to the hands of Polish authorities in April 1920, the institution consisted of 75 000 volumes, of which only 300 were in Polish. Witold Be≈Çza, the new director, (1920-1939 and 1945-1952), began to acquire more Polish books, and in 1939 the stock increased to 150 000 volumes, including: * 15th to 18th century manuscripts and books from the former Bernardine Library; * a collection of nearly 2 700 royal documents, privileges, decrees, manuscripts and autographs; * the only surviving manuscript of \\"The Oath\\" donated by Feliks Nowowiejski; * a dozen of books from Vladimir Lenin's collection in Poronin, donated by Adam Grzyma≈Ça- Siedlecki. During interwar period, the collections of the Municipal Library in Bydgoszcz were regarded as the richest on Kujawy in terms of literature. During the occupation the library has been isolated, forbidden to be consulted. Part of the Polish-language literature was handed over for destruction, even though many books were rescued by Polish citizens working in the warehouse. The historian Micha≈Ç Nycz moved many royal manuscripts away from the Nazi authorities. Some of the books were hidden in the Municipal museum or in basements of elementary schools in the suburbs of Bydgoszcz, so as not to be evacuated by German occupation forces. During World War II, 20% of the library stock have been lost, including 99 incunables. Plaque in memory of J√≥zef Wybicki After 1946, predominant trend was to collect scientific and popular works. The most valuable items, gathered in the Department of Special Collections, were isolated from the central database in 1953. It included among others, 1382 volumes from the Bernardine library, 4 900 items related to cartography, 972 manuscripts of artists such as J√≥zef Ignacy Kraszewski, Maria Konopnicka, Julian Krzy≈ºanowski, Jan Matejko, Henryk Sienkiewicz, Adam Grzyma≈Ça-Siedlecki, Leopold Staff, Stanis≈Çaw Wyspia≈Ñski and Tadeusz Boy- ≈ªele≈Ñski. In 1957, were incorporated into this Department a collection of medals, plaques, stamps, biographical materials of regional activists, and in 1959 a series of small prints. From the 1950s to the 1970s, the municipal library established many branches throughout the city: a new building has been planned to be erected, but the project was finally rejected and transformed to a major overhaul of the existing edifice. In the 1980s, repairs to a damaged building required to change the location of part of the stock. In 1968, the institution has been granted a scientific department, and in 1975, the library was labelled as provincial library. In 2009, a plaque in memory of J√≥zef Wybicki, a Polish jurist, political and military activist, has been unveiled on a wall of the Municipal Library, recalling its judicial past. Directors Since its inception, the Municipal Library has been managed by the following directors: * Georg Minde-Pouet (1903-1913); * Martin Bollert (1913-1920); * Witold Be≈Çza (1920-1939); * Ferdinand Lang (1939-1945); * Witold Be≈Çza (1945-1952); * J√≥zef Podg√≥reczny (1952-1965); * Mgr. Boles≈Çawa Podraza (1965- ); * Mgr. Antoni Sobieszczyk ( -1992); * Ewa Stelmachowska since 1992. Buildings The library complex encompasses two main buildings: one at Stary Rynek 24, one at D≈Çuga street 41. Stary Rynek 24 The building was constructed between 1774 and 1778 in the Neoclassical-Neo-Baroque style, as the seat of the Netze District. From 1781 to 1807, it housed the royal court of West Prussia. During the Duchy of Warsaw (1807-1815), the building contained the seat of the Bydgoszcz Department. Later on, it housed: * the authorities of the Bromberg (region) (from 1815 to 1838). After this date, the seat moved to the building at Jagiello≈Ñska street N¬∞3, now the Regional Office Building; * the Court of Appeal; * the Court District and Land Office; From 1908 onward, the edifice has been welcoming the Municipal Library. Before 1908, along Jana Kazimierza street and Zau≈Çek street stood a one-level building, lower than the main edifice, where was established a printing house. Between 1987 and 1999, this edifice has been thoroughly renovated, restoring the original architectural elements of the fa√ßade. The building displays architecture elements recalling the urban residence style, mixing late Rococo and early Neoclassical styles. The front elevation on Stary Rynek boasts 14 pilaster with ionic-type capitals. The central part of the facade is crowned with a line of vases and balustrade, mirroring the decoration of the double entrance stairs below. The basement ceiling exhibits vaults and cross vaults. A reconstruction in 1870-1876 dismantled the attic facade and the monumental staircase covered with a balustrade. \\"The Well\\" in 1914 in front of the pharmacy \\"Under the golden eagle\\" D≈Çuga street 41 This building has been erected in 1798 for the needs of the court of West Prussia. It became in 1903 property of the Kingdom of Prussia, and served as the seat of the court hearing till the completion of the edifice on Jagiello≈Ñska street N¬∞3. Later on it housed the Municipal Police (Friedrichstra√üe 58). Between both library buildings runs the narrow Zau≈Çek street: to unite the architectural ensemble, a covered passage called the \\"Bridge of Sighs\\" (), has been built in 1920. Since the 1920s, the Municipal Library owns the edifice. The outbuilding on the first floor harbours a collection of antique books from the ancient Bernardine monastery library, which stood in the 16th century in Bernardy≈Ñska Street. The building at D≈Çuga N¬∞41 has a \\"L\\" shape with a side outbuilding and the main entrance on the south elevation. The facades are divided by vertical pilasters and horizontal cornices. The vaulted cellars are still preserved. The edifice is topped by a Mansard roof with eyelid dormers. Fountain The fountain called \\"The Well\\" () was unveiled on October 4, 1909. Its creator was sculptor Karol Kowalczewski, and the funder Alfred Kupffender, owner of the pharmacy \\"Under the Golden Eagle\\" (), located on Stary Rynek. The sculpture commemorated the 100th anniversary of the pharmacy, and stood nearby the shop on the western part of the square: Alfred Kupffender donated it in gratitude towards the municipal authorities which decided to disband the geese-market which used to be held in front of the Golden Eagle pharmacy.Plaque about Bydgoszcz oldest pharmacies- Pharmacy museum at Gdanska Street 5 In 1940, Nazis authorities began to destroy the Jesuit Church that stood on Stary Rynek, and doing so demolished \\"The Well\\". Parts of the sculpture, stored in public gardens, survived the occupation period. Franciszek G√≥rski, stationmaster at a warehouse, even saved those bronze pieces from being melting away for military purposes. After the end of World War II, a newly cast \\"The Well\\", has been unveiled on May 1, 1948, moving its original location to stand right before the main elevation of the Municipal Public Library on Stary Rynek. The buildings are registered on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List N¬∞601414 Reg.A/868, since September 3, 1953.

Volume III 1939-1940. Editor Durward Howes. Zephyrus Press, INC.(New Jersey, 1974) P.260 Along with her specialization in pre-Cambrian geology, Edson focused on stratigraphic correlations. Her area of work required the use of well samples which were used at this point in geological history as more advanced technology, such as electric logs, were just on the verge of being discovered.  Early life  Born Fanny Carter in Chicago, Illinois, on October 5, 1887, she was one of the three daughters of Byron Beach Carter and Cora Belle Albridge Carter. Her father, Byron Beach Carter, graduated from the University of Wisconsin as a mechanical engineer. Throughout his career, he was well known for his machinery designs. He was ‚Äúthe designer of machinery for great railroads bridges including several across Mississippi River.‚Äù Her mother, Cora Belle Albridge, also attended State University becoming a member of the women's organization, Kappa Kappa Gamma. From both her paternal and maternal side, Carter Edson's ancestry is English. On her paternal side her great-grandparents immigrated to Wisconsin in 1850, while on her maternal side, her family immigrated in 1688.  Education  In 1906, Fanny Carter began her post-secondary education at the University of Wisconsin. Much like her mother, she also joined the women's organization, Kappa Kappa Gamma, and in 1910, she completed her degree specializing in geology. Three years later, Carter Edson returned to the University of Wisconsin to finish her master's degree.  Employment  She began her career as a Geologist at the Ecogal Exploration Company. Edson joined Roxana Petroleum Corporation, which was a subdivision of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, in her early years as a geologist in 1924. Edson established the corporation's sample lab to aid in the growing Mid-Continent drilling area. Her career at Roxana Petroleum Corporation ended in 1938, the same year she was chosen to be a Fellow of the Geological Society of America. After her time at Roxana Petroleum Corporation ended she found employment as the Chief Geologist at the Cimmaron Oil Company beginning in 1939.  Field of study and research focus  Fanny Carter went to Wisconsin University for her master's degree, to then rejoin her husband. She worked at his company as an advisory geologist and then eventually a secretary-treasurer, which was not a part of her field. She went back to school again at Stanford university she became a graduate student instructor in the geology school. After taking many years of school for geology, and with special training and experience she began working in September 1924, with Roxana Petroleum corporation, that is now a part of the Shell Oil Company. Mrs. Edson initially worked on the liberal latitude for Roxana, this means she was responsible for examining the samples from the well of subsurface sediments and create a stratigraphy ‚Äúmap‚Äù of the layers of sediment. Fanny's work with the samples from the well and her stratigraphy sequences was helping the company's understanding of the subsurface Ordovician stratigraphy. Under Fanny's supervision the lab staff grew in numbers and they began to be known for their volume and authentic character of their stratigraphic work, and also being the most efficient in the region. In 1932, Fanny Carter Edson received a signal honor, although she did not have numerous writings, she was the first women of commercial employment. She was the one women elected that year to the fellowship in the Geological Society of America, which at that time was exclusive and only included 10 other women. Fanny Carter was a petroleum geologist and was a member of the American association of petroleum geologists for 30 years.  Impact on women  Fanny Carter Edson's pursuit in geology has become an amazing example for woman all around the world in hopes to also pursue a career in the sciences. She was one of the few women who were early members of the geological profession. Because of this, all of her research and findings creates a precedence for the scientific and mathematical potential for all woman. Not only was Fanny a pioneer in her field, she was also a mother and a wife. Sending a message of women's capabilities to work while supporting and caring for a family. And even after the divorce, she was able to maintain her career while solely caring for her child.  Contribution to geology  Edson's work was predominantly in the field of petroleum geology. Among her many contributions to her field she established a field laboratory facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that examined well samples of subsurface sediments and devised methods of strati-graphic correlation and other practical applications of her findings. Her laboratory work was supplemented by field examination of outcrop sections in Oklahoma, and by participation in the wide-ranging field conferences through the Arbuckle and the Ozark mountains, the Missouri and the Mississippi river valleys, and along the Rocky Mountain front. Edson's work with the well samples and the strati-graphic sequences guided her company's understanding of the subsurface Ordovician stratigraphy. Further, her determinations and mapping of the subsurface pre-Mississippian rocks yielded for her company an accurate outline of the newly recognized Central Kansas uplift.  Personal life  Fanny Carter Edson was married to Frank Aaron Edson, whose work in iron-ore exploration made them travel to Minnesota. The Edson's moved in 1917 to Duluth, Minnesota. They then had their daughter in June. While the United States had entered the First World War, the duties of Fanny's husband with the Y.M.C.A. Field Service took him to various army training camps, while Fanny remained in Duluth. For three years she filled various clerical positions, and taught general science for one semester in public schools. Fanny and her daughter joined her husband in 1921 at Norman, Oklahoma, where he was employed on the Oklahoma Geological Survey. She continued and furthered her studies there for a few years. Now versed in geology, and with special training and experience in pre-Cambrian stratigraphy and structure, North American Mid-Continent geology, mineralogy and petrography, and phases of subsurface exploration, Fanny Carter Edson accepted employment with the Roxana Petroleum Corporation (now part of the Shell Oil Company) in September, 1924, at Tulsa. There, she became solely responsible for the personal rearing of her daughter when she and her husband divorced in 1923. There she began the application of her science and her most rigorous studies to the vocation in which she was enthralled for the remainder of her life.  Achievements  Nearing the end of her career, Edson was employed at the U.S. Geological Survey (1942-1945). In addition to her fellowship at the Geological Society of American she was also a prominent member of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists and the Stratigraphic Society of Tulsa, Oklahoma.

It is known to have been built by the town's Jewett brothers, who are credited with building Montgomery's other surviving covered bridges. This assemblage is one of the most concentrated in Vermont all attributable to a single builder. The Jewetts used standardized dimensions for their construction (except for the bridge length), and prepared wood for the bridges at their lumberyard in Montgomery's West Hill area. The bridge was originally located in Montgomery Center, and was relocated to the Gibou Road location in the early 1900s. As of 2003, the bridge was reported to be in a local construction yard, awaiting repairs and a determination by the town of where to place it.

Its mission is to build a more peaceful world by: working with people directly affected by conflict to find peaceful solutions; shaping policies and practices to support peace; and collaborating with those striving for peace. Alert accomplishes these goals through dialogue, training, research and policy analysis, advocacy and outreach activities. International Alert is headquartered in London, but also maintains a European office in The Hague.346 Clapham Road, SW9 9AP London, United Kingdom This NGO maintains about 250 staff in nineteen countries. These experts work with over 800 partner organizations on projects to advance conflict resolution, support human rights, and build a more peaceful future. Alert‚Äôs main geographic areas of operation are Africa, Asia and the Middle East, but it is also supporting peace activities in Colombia, the Caucasus and Ukraine. Michael Young became Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in 2019. https://fundraising.co.uk/2019/07/05/recruitment-round-up-new-appointments- charity-sector/#.XS93bpNKj-Y The chairman of Alert‚Äôs Board of Trustees is retired US ambassador Carey Cavanaugh, a former peace mediator. https://www.charitytoday.co.uk/international-alert-appoints-new-chair-and- board-members/ History In 1985 the Standing International Forum on Ethnic Conflict, Development and Human Rights (SIFEC) was founded with the purpose of addressing the issue of conflict and to alert governments and the world to developing crises. The following year, SIFEC merged with another organization, International Alert on Genocide and Massacres, to become International Alert (IA). Alert was founded in 1986 by Leo Kuper, Michael Young, Martin Ennals and Luis Kutner in response to growing frustration in the international development and human rights community that internal conflicts were impeding the ability to protect and provide for civilian populations and that there was no effective international mechanism to address this situation. International Alert undertook to advance research on the causes of such conflict and to promote all means of conciliation and resolution, becoming an early advocate of multitrack diplomacy. From its first days, the conflict in Sri Lanka was a particular focus. Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the former Archbishop of Cape Town was engaged in the formation of the new organization and became Vice Chairman of its Board of Trustees. Martin Ennals, the former Secretary General of Amnesty International and founder of Article 19, served as Secretary General of the new organization. From 1986-1989, Ennals was International Alert‚Äôs only full-time staff member. He was joined by Andy Carl (later the founder of Conciliation Resources, who managed IA from 1992-1993 following Ennals‚Äô death. Alert expanded rapidly in 1994-1998 under the leadership of Kumar Rupesinghe, growing to over 50 staff with major programs in Sri Lanka, Burundi, and Sierra Leone. NGOs in Conflict: An Evaluation of International Alert (1997) https://issuu.com/cmi- norway/docs/1180-ngos-in-conflict-an-evaluation-of-internation By 1998 Alert had a budget of approximately UK¬£5 million and 80 staff, managing programs in over 15 countries in conflict. Dan Smith, now Secretary General of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute served as Secretary General from 2003-2015. From 2015-1019, Harriet Lamb, CEO of the United Kingdom Fairtrade Foundation for over a decade. became International Alert‚Äôs CEO. Michael Young formally assumed this leadership role in September 2019 bringing decades of experience in the peacebuilding and humanitarian sectors, most recently with the International Rescue Committee and Mercy Corps. Board Members International Alert‚Äôs board of trustees is composed of the following members: Carey Cavanaugh, Hans Bolscher, Chris Deri, Abir Haj Ibrahim, Padma Jyoti, Oliver Kemp, Lisa L. Rose, Erin Segilia-Chase, and Gregor Stewart. Cavanaugh became board chair in 2018. Notable initiatives=Data mining for conflict prevention International Alert was an early advocate for the development of conflict early warning systems. Its work on gender and peacebuilding was important in establishing the necessity of incorporating gender relations and female stakeholders in conflict early warning systems. By the early 1990s, International Alert was using the HURIDOCS database in conjunction with early Internet conferencing systems, to enable it to keep abreast of and interact with \\"local and international nongovernmental organizations and international experts.\\" Through the mid-1990s, by applying a combination of manual and automated analysis in conjunction with such systems, researchers collaborating with International Alert performed early data mining research, demonstrating the viability of this approach for predicting conflict outcomes and encouraging the development of a website for the African Union's Continental Early Warning System (CEWS). Millennium Peace Prize for Women In 2001, as part of International Alert's Women Building Peace campaign, the organisation collaborated with the United Nations Development Fund for Women awarded a Millennium Peace Prize for Women. Peacehack In 2015 and 2016, International Alert organised a series of hackathons called Peacehack, exploring ways information technology might be used to reduce conflict by discouraging hate speech. Conflict Caf√© Conflict Caf√© is designed to champion ‚Äúpeace through food.‚Äù First established in 2014 as Conflict Kitchen London, this annual program fosters increased public awareness and understanding of key conflict and peace issues. Each year a pop- up restaurant is set up in London which offers cuisine prepared by chefs from a specific conflict region ‚Äì Syria, Armenia, Turkey, Lebanon, Sri Lanka, Myanmar. For several nights, over these meals, the general public has an opportunity to meet with active peacebuilding practitioners and policymakers and learn firsthand about peoples affected by violent conflict. https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/foodanddrink/conflict-cafe-how-food-can- be-used-to-break-down-barriers-a2924496.html; References Category:International charities Category:Charities based in London Category:Peace organisations based in the United Kingdom ","title":"International Alert"},{"id":"52191669","text":"Fernando Gonz√°lez (born 26 August 1950) is an Ecuadorian former swimmer.

They usually inhabit hedges and woods. Description Panorpa cognata has a fore-wing length ranging between 10 and 15mm, and are orange-brown in colour, sometimes with black colouration along the posterior margin, the base of the antennae, sometimes the pronotum. True to their name, males have an oval-shaped genital bulb, resembling that of a scorpion's stinger.Engqvist, L. & Sauer, K.P. 2002.

The abdomen is black and yellow striped with an orange extremity. In males the sixth abdominal segment is square and appendages are divergent.Insects-chinery. Pag 108 Biology Larvae and adults mainly feed on dead insects and carrion. Adults are visible from May to July. As a model organism P. cognata has been used as a model organism for investigating sexual selection; effects of condition on female choice and male mating behaviours, cryptic sexual selection, and effects of multiple mates on fecundity and egg hatching. Female P. cognata are polyandrous, allowing females greater access to resources, in the form of salivary nuptial gifts from multiple mates, increased genetic variation in her offspring, and resulting in a greater success of eggs hatching compared to monandrous females Engqvist, L. (2006). Females benefit from mating with different males in the scorpionfly Panorpa cognata. Behavioral Ecology, 17(3), 435-440.Engqvist, L. (2007). Nuptial gift consumption influences female remating in a scorpionfly: male or female control of mating rate?. Evolutionary Ecology, 21(1), 49 -61. Polyandry results in a high incidence of sperm competition, and males compete for the ability to mate with females. Male P. cognata do not compete directly, and do not guard or restrict females, but attract potential mates through pheromones; initiating copulation with a salivary nuptial gift following a premating display that can sometimes last hours in length. Condition of both female and male P. cognata ultimately play a role in a successful copulation.Engqvist, L. & Sauer, K. P. 2003. Determinants of sperm transfer in the scorpionfly Panorpa cognata: male variation, female condition and copulation duration. Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 16, 1196‚Äì1204. Once copulation is initiated, sperm transfer is maintained at a constant, linear rate, indicating that longer copulation periods allow for the transfer of more sperm, however, individual males have significantly varying rates of sperm transfer. Copulation duration is directly linked to the size of salivary nuptial gift presented to the female, with larger salivary gifts resulting in copulations of longer duration, and a greater number of sperm transferred.Engqvist, L. 2001. Strategic male mating effort and cryptic male choice in a scorpionfly. Proceedings of the Royal Society B Biological Sciences, 268(1468), 729-735. At the beginning of the breeding seasons, males are more particular in mate choice, choosing to expend more energy attracting and mating with females of good condition, while by the end of the breeding season, males are less picky towards female condition, and breed more indiscriminately. Male reproductive investment Investment in reproduction is costly for male P. cognata, as they must ‚Äúwoo‚Äù females, and eventually produce a salivary mass to initiate copulation. Once copulation has begun, sperm transfer itself is costly, as well. Sperm is transferred into the female via a sperm pump, which has two thick muscles, one on either side of the pump. Nutrient availability during the larval stage affects adult body weight, and the development of the males' salivary glands. Males with restricted access to nutrients in larval stage have reduced mating success compared to those of good condition with access to greater amounts of nutrients in the larval stage.Engels, S. & Sauer, K. 2007. Energy beyond the pupal stage: Larval nutrition and its long-time consequences for male mating performance in a scorpionfly. Journal of Insect Physiology, 53(7), 633-638. Males of lower condition have less resources to produce nuptial gifts, resulting in smaller salivary masses, shorter mating duration, and less sperm transferred.Engqvist, L. (2009). Should I stay or should I go? Condition- and status-dependent courtship decisions in the scorpionfly Panorpa cognata. Animal Behaviour, 78(2), 491-497. To counteract their poor condition, males tend to have a longer premating duration than those of higher condition. Males of higher condition tend to have shorter premating periods and larger nuptial gifts. Premating rituals do not always finish in successful copulation, females abandon the male courting her for better, more attractive mates. Male P. cognata regulate their mating investment according to the amount of sperm competition. Female P. cognata store sperm from each male she mates with, and each consecutive mate has the ability to assess how much sperm she is storing, thus down-adjusting the male's investment in copulation with a female who has more sperm stored.Engqvist, L. 2007. Male Scorpionflies Assess the Amount of Rival Sperm Transferred by Females' Previous Mates. Evolution, 61(6), 1489-1494. Female reproductive investment The condition of female P. cognata, dictated by nutritional availability in the larval stage, is positively correlated with the number of sperm transferred during copulation, with males transferring sperm to females in good condition at a faster rate than they would transfer to females of poor condition. Females control the duration of copulation, which is directly affected by the size of the salivary nuptial gift provided by the male. The species, P. cognata, benefits as a whole from the female mating with multiple males and ingesting multiple salivary nuptial gifts, as each salivary mass a female ingests has been shown to have, on average, a positive 8% increase on the number of eggs she lays.Engqvist, L. 2007b. Nuptial food gifts influence female egg production in the scorpionfly Panorpa cognata. Ecological Entomology. 32(3), 327 -332. The duration of copulation impacts the female's length of time between rematings; longer copulations result in a longer period between matings.

He is the only independent to serve as U.S. president and the only person unanimously elected to that office. 1755 House of Burgesses election Washington first stood for election to the Virginia House of Burgesses from Frederick County, Virginia in 1755 at the age of 23. Two burgesses were elected from each Virginia county by and among the male landowners. Members of the House of Burgesses did not serve fixed terms, unlike its successor the Virginia House of Delegates, and it remained sitting until dissolved by the governor or until seven years had passed, whichever occurred sooner. Elections during this time were not conducted by secret ballot but rather by viva voce. The sheriff of the county, a clerk, and a representative of each candidate would be seated at a table, and each elector would approach the table and openly declare his vote. In elections to the House of Burgesses, each voter cast two votes and two candidates were elected who received the greatest number of votes. 1758 House of Burgesses election In 1758, Washington again stood for election to the House of Burgesses. Washington's campaign was managed by Colonel James Wood, who procured 160 gallons of alcoholic drinks and distributed them gratis to 391 voters in the county. Washington won the election with more than 39-percent of the vote. Thomas Bryan Martin won Frederick County's other house seat; he was the nephew of the Lord Fairfax of Cameron, governor of Virginia. 1761 House of Burgesses election Washington successfully stood for re-election to his seat in the House of Burgesses in 1761, campaigning with his neighbor George Mercer. The three candidates were Washington, Mercer, and Adam Stephen, and all three had fought together during the disastrous Battle of Fort Necessity in the Seven Years' War. Stephen emerged as a critic of Washington, unlike Mercer, and their rivalry continued through to the American Revolution. Washington and Mercer received the support of \\"the leaders of all the patrician families\\" of the county, while Stephen attracted \\"the attention of the plebians\\". 1788 United States presidential election Washington is inaugurated as president of the United States in 1789. The first U.S. presidential election was held over a period of weeks from December 1788 to January 1789. Washington was elected with 69 of the 69 first-round votes cast in the United States Electoral College. With this election, he became the only U.S. president to be unanimously chosen. No popular vote totals are listed in this table. In early elections, many electors were chosen by state legislatures instead of public balloting, and votes were cast for undifferentiated lists of candidates in those states which practiced public balloting, leaving no or only partial vote totals. 1792 United States presidential election Washington was unanimously re-elected President of the United States in the 1792 election, carrying all first-round electoral votes.

It extends mainly along North Calais Road, paralleling Pekin Brook below Mirror Lake, where ruins of its former industrial past are still evident. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. Description and history The historic district is generally arrayed along North Calais Road, between its junction with Upper Road in the north and just beyond Nelson Pond Road in the south. A second, smaller axis of buildings are found along Upper Road, running south from the same junction to Dondone Road, a short spur that crosses Pekin Brook to the join the two major roads. Part of the district is also found along the GAR Road, which runs northwest along the southern shore of Mirror Lake. Almost all of the buildings in this area are residential wood frame structures, 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 stories in height. Most are Greek Revival in style. Non-residential buildings include a village hall and general store. Foundational remnants and ruins of the area's mills, and of a large early tavern, are found lining the banks of Pekin Brook. with North Calais is one of the rural community's five village centers, which all arose in some isolation from one another due to the folded hilly terrain. The earliest documented mills on Pekin Brook date to the early 19th century. The village benefited in the mid-19th century from the abundant waterpower to provide a number of services to the surrounding rural areas, including the processing of wool from sheep, which became a major industry in Vermont in the 19th century. The village also benefited from its presence on the stagecoach route between Montpelier and Newport, continuing north into Canada. The village was bypassed by railroad development in the late 19th century, and its relatively small mills declined in the early 20th century, the buildings eventually succumbing to fire, neglect, and demolition. A number of the village's higher quality homes were built by the various mill owners.

Born in Boston, Massachusetts (MA), Allen was raised in the nearby village of Newtonville, Massachusetts, then in Lexington, Massachusetts. She studied Geology at a number of institutions, including Mount Holyoke College, Wisconsin University, and Northwestern University. Allen worked as an engineering geologist for the entirety of her professional career for the United States government in Washington, D.C. until her retirement in 1982.  Personal life  Allen was born in 1907 in Boston, Massachusetts and was brought up in the nearby communities of Newtonville, and later on, Lexington. Apart from her geological career, she was also an avid piano player. She taught Sunday School at the Fourth Church of Christ in Washington, D.C., the city in which she spent her entire career. After retiring from the U.S Bureau of Mines in 1982, she moved into a local retirement community where she eventually died of heart failure on April 5, 2002 at the age of 94.  Education  Allen began her academic career while attending Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts, where she obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in Geology. Subsequently, she earned her master of arts degree in Geology at Wisconsin University in 1931, while maintaining a job as a secretary on campus. Continuing her education, she worked as an assistant during the duration of her studies at Northwestern University from 1931 to 1936.  Career  Commencing her professional career in 1936, Allen worked as a geological engineer for U. S. government in Washington, D.C., undertaking work at the U.S Geological Survey (USGS). She was a member of multiple institutions, including the USGS Military Geology Unit (MGU) where she was the one of the first affiliated members in 1942. Her role at MGU contained analysis and creation of topographic products. These commodities were used by the American forces during World War I war and invoked critical and diplomatic planning. The topographic products depicted trafficability of vehicles, military dominance given the terrain, drafting of assault locations and establishing safe water sites for combat units. Following the war, Allen, along with much of the MGU, was transferred to the Engineering Geology Branch (EGB) where she served as the interim representative and spokesperson. The role of the EGB was to provide geological advice to federal agencies and any inquiring public offices. When the EGB moved the center of its operations to Denver, Colorado in 1946, Allen was appointed the Washington D.C. representative and her responsibilities were to correspond with inquiring agencies on a daily basis as well as to complete tasks as assigned by the Denver office. It was at EGB that she recognized that the geological concerns of many large American cities were being neglected. Under her direction, at least one experienced geologist established an office in all major American cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle. Allen's program operated successfully for 20 years before it began to be neglected; by this time Allen had left the EGB. Eventually, the EGB was dissolved in 1978. After leaving EGB, Allen joined the Extraterrestrial Research Agency at the Office of the Chief of Engineers. She brought engineering geological sense to the United States Army's pre-NASA program to create a lunar-face geomorphologic map. Allen was recognized for her accomplishment in 1968 with a Superior Performance Commendation. Upon completion in 1971, the entirety of the Army's lunar geology program was transferred to NASA. For the latter part of her geological career, Allen worked with the United States Bureau of Mines where she studied the environmental impacts of mine subsidence. She put together a highly successful effort (the Mesabi Project) to locate, map, and characterize subsidence- impacted land. This project focused on former mine districts in Minnesota, north-eastern Pennsylvania, Iowa, and Missouri. Allen's work on this project earned her the Interior Department Meritorious Service Award.  Awards  * In 1968, Alice Allen was the recipient of the Superior Performance Commendation for her assistance within the assemblage of lunar maps for the United States governments pre-NASA programs. * She earned the Interior Department's Meritorious Service Award for her work on the Mesabi Project. * For her work on Basic Questions Concerning Coal Mine Subsidence in the United States, she was given a publication award by the Association of Engineering Geologists in 1979. * Although not an award, she was elected as an Honorary Member of the Geological Society of America in 1987 for her professional activities over the decades.

She was the first woman to have launched an independent radio station in Chad. She declared that community radio stations play a vital role in the development of Chad, but do not receive substantial support from the Chadian state. In addition to her career in Chadian Television, Yacoub has also produced several, mostly documentary, short films with her own production company, Sud Cap Production, which she founded in 2001. Both in her films and off the screen, Yacoub is committed to greater human rights, especially to the equality of women in Chad, which has made her a target for repression. Her short film \\"Dilemme au f√©minin\\" which criticized female genital mutilation was especially controversial. The film led to strong protests in the country and a fatwa was pronounced against her due to nudity and other objectionable material.

This book contains the prophecies attributed to the prophet Isaiah, and is a part of the Books of the Prophets.Theodore Hiebert, et al. 1996. The New Interpreter's Bible: Volume VI. Nashville: Abingdon. Chapters 40-55 are known as \\"Deutero-Isaiah\\" and date from the time of the Israelites' exile in Babylon. This chapter contains a poem known as the first of the \\"Servant songs\\" about the servant, whom Jewish tradition holds that Isaiah identifies as either the Israelites themselves (, or l'goyim) or Cyrus (in contrast to Jewish Christian and, thus, later gentile Christian tradition, as well as Islamic tradition). Scholars such as John Goldingay, John Barton, and John Muddiman also hold the view that the Old Testament identifies the servant of the Servant songs as the Israelites in Is. 41:8-9; Is. 44:1; Is. 44:21; Is. 45:4; Is. 48:20 and Is. 49:3.Barton, John, and John Muddiman, eds.

The latter two write that \\"The idea of a 'servant' played a small part in the earlier chapters, being used as a designation of the unworthy Eliakim in 22:20 and of the figure of David in 37:35, but it now comes to the fore as a description of major significance, the noun being used more than 20 times in chs. 40-55. Its first usage is obviously important in establishing the sense in which we are to understand it, and here it is clear that the community of Israel/Jacob is so described.\\"  Text  The original text was written in Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 25 verses. Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), Codex Leningradensis (1008).

The eye of the beholder: the life of Mu·∏•ammad as viewed by the early Muslims: a textual analysis. Vol. 5. Darwin Pr, 1995. Isiah 42 is prophesying about a messiah coming for gentiles and Jesus in Mathew 15:24 said to woman that \\"I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.\\" So Muslims interpret that Isiah 42 is prophesying about Muhammad Since God say in Quran 21:107 And We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except as a mercy to the worlds According to the Hadiths, Muslims like 'Abd Allah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As have believed that Muhammad was the servant of Isaiah 42 during his very lifetime.

He is credited with originating the conversational method where students hear a teacher speak a word, then write it, then speak it. This method replaced the older method of simply memorizing words and grammar. Born in Tours, France, he graduated from the University of Poitiers in 1900. He married Melanie Phillips of Pennsylvania in 1903 and came to the U.S. in 1905. They had one daughter, Marcelle. He received his doctorate degree from Saint Joseph College in 1907. His career included heading the modern language department at Temple University and the French Department at the University of Pennsylvania prior to 1918. While teaching at both schools he became affiliated with the Sigma Pi chapters at each and was initiated into the organization. He then became director of foreign languages for the Cleveland Public Schools in Ohio from 1918 to 1949. Upon arriving in Cleveland he founded the Maison Fran√ßaise de Cleveland. Members of the group met once a month where guest lecturers would speak on French literature and culture. De Sauz√© took the time to train the district's teachers in his method which contributed to its success. He insisted that they participate in the activities of the Maison Fran√ßaise. He worked with Western Reserve University to set up a laboratory school for children in first grade through high school where language courses were taught in the target languages. Teaching students were required to spend time observing in the school to learn the methods being taught there.http://files.eric.ed.gov/mwg- internal/de5fs23hu73ds/progress?id=uVxgBXUntprv9mtQixqwOHhsxbz890s-4GcG3M54Otk,pgs 51-52 In 1922, he began one of the few foreign language programs in elementary schools in the United States. While in Ohio he also taught at Western Reserve University. After retirement he taught summer sessions at Laval University in Quebec until 1959.

It is unclear when Anseau was count, although it is likely that he assumed the title after his brother-in- law Guy II the Red died in 1108. His appointment as seneschal was disputed by Fulk V, Count of Anjou, who considered the position as belonging to his family. The issue was resolved through the intervention of Amaury III of Montfort (his future son-in-law), Geoffrey of Vend√¥me and Raoul de Boisgency. Legend has it that in 1115, Anseau and his niece Yolande were crossing the forest Roissy-en-Brie on horseback when a boar attacked them. They were rescued by a clown and a peasant who were rewarded for their bravery by a plot of land in the forest. Anseau first married a daughter (name unknown) of Guichard de Beaujeu III and Lucienne de Rochefort. His second wife was Beatrice of Montlh√©ry, daughter of Guy I of Montlh√©ry and Hodierna of Gometz. Anseau and Beatrice had one daughter: Agnes (Garlande) de Monfort.

During the last two years of publishing Morton would use The Conservative as a forum through which to disagree and criticize his rival Nebraska Democrat William Jennings Bryan and his publication The Commoner.

It is the epic poem that was written in the Ayutthaya period (in the middle of 17th century). In the Khun Chang Kun Phaen poem, thaeng yuak is mentioned in the Funeral of Wan Tong chapter when Khun Phaen ( the main character) decided to arrange the formal funeral for Wan Tong, one of his lovers. Furthermore, in the 19th century, thaeng yuak art was a very common carving art in many provinces.

The art has been influenced by the lifestyle of people and creates their own unique pattern. The pattern styles are based on the ideal of beauty in Thai art such as Kranok pattern (‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏´‡∏ô‡∏Å). Some patterns has lost by the change of new lifestyle but the others have been saved by the tradition and some new generations. Therefore, the old pattern will be saved and survive through the time. They are similar to Thai traditional style such as Kra nok pattern but the detail is not as rich as the normal pattern. Thaeng yuak is the art that uses fresh plants as the material, therefore it must be done in a day before it would rot. There are 7 main patterns for thaeng yuak:Daungchan S.

A) The Mixing pattern - the 1st, 3rd, and 5th Herringbone patterns can be combined together to create 2 layers of patterns but they usually combine only 2 styles together. For example, 1st and 3rd Herringbone patterns, the 1st Herringbone will be the first layer and then place 3rd Herringbone at the back. Or 5th Herringbone combine together which they will create the 2 layers of 5th Herringbone pattern. 4) Tiger calf pattern ( \\"‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏ô‡πà‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏™‡∏¥‡∏á‡∏´‡πå\\", Nong Sing pattern, ‡∏ô‡πà‡∏≠‡∏á or Nong means calf and ‡∏™‡∏¥‡∏á‡∏´‡πå or Sing means tiger ) is the basic pattern used on the pole or edge of a bier or Mea ru. 5) Na Kra Darn pattern (‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏´‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏î‡∏≤‡∏ô) or front board pattern (‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏´‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏î‡∏≤‡∏ô, ‡∏´‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≤ means front and ‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏î‡∏≤‡∏ô means board) is the pattern used on top, middle and floor areas of a bier. 6) Sao pattern (‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏™‡∏≤) or pole pattern (‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏™‡∏≤,‡πÄ‡∏™‡∏≤ mean pole) is a very important pattern for every thaeng yuak artist.

Most members of the gang grew up on the westside of the Alexandra Park estate in Moss Side around Gooch Close (which is where the gang gets its name). The Gooch is part of an alliance of Crip gangs, and has had violent disputes with many other South Manchester gangs, most notably The Doddington Gang (Formerly known as the Pepperhill Mob), The Moss Side Bloods and The Longsight Crew.  History  The Gooch Gang has its origins in the westside of the Alexandra Park estate in Moss Side. Young men would hang around a Shebeen on Gooch Close selling drugs which is where the gang started and how they got their name. Gooch Close was a small cul-de-sac of semi-detached houses with an alley at one end. In the mid 1990s the Alexandra Park estate was redeveloped and the street was redesigned and had its name changed to Westerling Way. The gangs - whilst supplying to the street dealers - also try to ensure that the dealers are protected from other gangs by protecting their territory. Most of their problems occur when rival street dealers start to move into territory already controlled by a gang or when a gang 'taxes' a rival dealer - a move seen as damaging street credibility and respect. The gangs in south manchester including the Gooch gang were made up of mostly first & second generation British West Indies caribbean heritage members, whose grandparents came to England from the 1950s. Around the same time as the Gooch Close gang was becoming known around the city, the Pepperhill Gang were also starting to emerge - taking their name from a pub on the eastside of the Alexandra Park estate. When the pub was closed down and the gang targeted by police, they reformed around nearby Doddington Close and would go on to become known as the Doddington Gang. in the late 1980s and early 1990s the Pepperhill gang were involved in a gang war between Moss Side and the Cheetham Hill Gang from North Manchester. The Gooch often bought and sold drugs with the Cheetham Hill Gang. The Gooch had close ties to Cheetham Hill, with the cousin of the Cheetham Hill Head being a leading figure in the Gooch. The Pepperhill gang thought this was helping the \\"enemy\\". The Pepperhill gang declared that nobody from South Manchester was to have dealings with Cheetham Hill. This angered the Gooch and a fierce war erupted, dividing the Alexandra Park estate in half, with the Gooch on the westside and the Pepperhill on the eastside. Although the gang war was centred around Moss Side young males from neighbouring areas would be drawn into the conflict resulting in a number of deaths and regular shooting incidents in South Manchester throughout the 1990s and 2000s. [7] In 1996, an offshoot gang was identified (Young Gooch) which gained a frightening reputation for the violence and guns its members used. Five of its members were later arrested following Operation Eagle and were sentenced to more than 43 years in prison. The Young Gooch started to war with the newly emerging Longsight Crew, a younger offshoot of the Doddington gang whose members were based on a number of estates in the Longsight and Ardwick areas of south Manchester, especially their headquarters of Langport Avenue. By the mid 2000s the Gooch had grown to become a vast gang made up of a number of smaller offshoot crews based around south Manchester. The most notable of these being the Longsight Street Soldiers, Old Trafford Crips, Rusholme Crips and Fallowfield Mad Dogs. These gangs would carry on the rivalry with Doddington and Longsight Crew in the 2000s.  Imprisonment  Ten members of south Manchester's Gooch gang were put on trial in October 2008 for a catalogue of gang-related crimes. Gang members Colin Joyce and Lee Amos had been arrested in 2000, when they had been apprehended at their 'nerve centre' in a house in Moss Side, found with an 'extraordinary array of firearms'.[1] In 2001, they had been sentenced to nine years in prison but had been released early, on licence, in 2007 and there had followed a new bout of shootings. In April 2009, Joyce and Amos were among 11 members of the 'Gooch gang' who were found guilty and charged with a 'catalogue of crimes' which included the murder of Ucal Chin and Tyrone Gilbert. These convictions were hailed by Manchester's chief prosecutor John Holt as having 'enormous significance for public safety'. Their trials were held 35 miles away at Liverpool Crown Court to lower the risk of witness intimidation from other gang members. Not unusually, the perpetrators of gun crime were also the victims, with Amos's brother Stephen Baba-Tunde Amos having been shot dead, in a gang-related shooting, aged 21, outside a bar in Ashton-under-Lyne in 2002. Colin Joyce, aged 29, known as the leader of the gang, was given a minimum 39-year sentence. Lee Amos was sentenced to receive at least 35 years. Three other members of the gang were given minimum sentences of between 30 and 35 years.

In 2008, he founded Mongrel with Jon McClure of Reverend and The Makers. In 2009, he became the bassist for ex-Milburn frontman Joe Carnall's band The Book Club, but left later that year to join Reverend and The Makers. He is currently producing and performing in hip hop group Clubs & Spades with Maticmouth from Reverend Soundsystem. Biography=Early days An attendee of Stocksbridge High School, Nicholson was the only member of the Arctic Monkeys to not live in the High Green district, residing in nearby Hillsborough. Nicholson played bass guitar, and was seen as \\"the band wit, reliably swift with a self-deprecating quip\\". He played on Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not and the EPs Five Minutes with Arctic Monkeys and Who the Fuck Are Arctic Monkeys?. Departure from Arctic Monkeys The band announced in May 2006 that Nicholson would miss the band's forthcoming North America tour as he was suffering from \\"fatigue following an intensive period of touring\\", and would be temporarily replaced by Nick O'Malley of The Dodgems while Nicholson recovered. However, on 20 June 2006, it was announced that he was no longer part of the band, with Alex Turner later stating \\"we sorta found ourselves in a situation where we wanted to move forward\\". The band asked Nicholson to leave. Helders later remarked: \\"It‚Äôs not for everyone, the traveling, I suppose ... He didn‚Äôt get specific. We didn‚Äôt want to drag all of that out of him ... We took [Nick] out to America and we just couldn't see going back to the way things were for whatever reason.\\" Not until 2019 did Nicholson himself open up on the issue. In an interview with podcast The Michael Anthony Show, Nicholson told the host that leaving the band that he co-found was \\"soul destroying\\". The bassist added that news of his imminent departure came as a huge shock and was far from mutual. Nicholson went on to detail the meeting which ended his time as a Monkey and also painted a vivid picture of life in the years that followed which included struggles with mental health as well a new search for identity. Post-Arctic Monkeys Initially, Nicholson began making a name for himself in Sheffield as a DJ, mainly as a resident at Threads, but also performing at Reverend Soundsystem (under the name AndyGun). He also remixed a Reverend and The Makers song \\"You Get So Alone Sometimes it Just Makes Sense\\". In November 2007 he made his DJ d√©but in London at a club event called Threads vs Filthy Few. In 2008, Nicholson formed Mongrel, which consisted of himself, Jon McClure of Reverend and the Makers, Babyshambles bassist Drew McConnell and Matt Helders from Arctic Monkeys, as well as London rapper Lowkey from the Poisonous Poets. They released their first album, Better Than Heavy on 7 March 2009. He was also in the band Lords of Flatbush, with Sheffield-based singer Steve Edwards and Louis Carnall formerly of Milburn, but left to concentrate on Mongrel. The position was handed over to his brother Rob Nicholson of Sheffield band Dead World Leaders. In August 2009, Nicholson joined ex-Milburn frontman Joe Carnall's band The Book Club, but left later that year when, on 23 December Jon McClure announced via his Twitter account and official website that Nicholson would be made an official member of Reverend and the Makers. He remained in the group until their 2010 hiatus but when they reformed in January 2012 Nicholson was replaced by his friend and former bandmate in The Book Club, Joe Carnall. Nicholson is currently producing and performing in hip-hop group Clubs & Spades with Maticmouth from Reverend Soundsystem. They made their live d√©but at The Plug on Saturday 20 July 2013 as part of Tramlines Festival and their d√©but album Stand Up was released on Monday 22 July 2013. He is also part of production duo Sticky Blood with Jamie Shield. Political views In November 2019, along with 34 other musicians, Nicholson signed a letter endorsing the Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the 2019 UK general election with a call to end austerity.

Biography Francis Henry Fries was born on February 1, 1855, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. His parents were Francis Levin Fries and Lisetta Maria Vogler. Fries attended the Salem Boys' School, and later graduated from Davidson College in 1874. At 21 years old, Fries joined his father's textile firm, F & H Fries Manufacturing Company, working as a mechanic and a blacksmith. During his tenure he would work in all of the company's departments. In 1878, Fries traveled with his brother and uncle to Europe, visiting the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. Upon his return he was promoted to superintendent. On November 23, 1881 he married Letitia Walker Patterson, granddaughter of Governor John Motley Morehead. She and their only child died three years later, both around the same time. In 1886, Fries married Anna P. de Schweinitz, later having a daughter with her. That year he also oversaw the construction of Arista Mills, the first textile mill in North Carolina to have electric lighting. In 1887, Fries left his father's company. Instead, he was prompted undertake an effort to connect Winston-Salem to Roanoke, Virginia by rail to improve commerce. Supervising all financing and construction, Fries completed what became known as the Roanoke and Southern Railway in four years. He served as the railway's first president. As a Democrat, he served on the staff of Governor Alfred Moore Scales, where he earned the title of \\"Colonel\\" which he would use in his professional career to distinguish himself from his father. In 1893, Fries went into banking and became president of the Wachovia Loan and Trust Company. Looking for areas to develop along the Southern Railway, Fries began exploring the possibility of setting up textile mills along the Mayo River. In 1895 he erected the Mayo Mill and established the town of Mayodan. In 1900 Fries purchased rural farmland surrounding Bartlett Falls on the New River in Grayson County, Virginia. He then hired a local labor force to build a dam, a cotton mill and a full-service company owned town. By 1901, the New River Train was extended to the mill site and Fries petitioned the Virginia State Legislature to incorporate the new town of Carico, Virginia. For reasons that are not well documented, the town name was instead legislatively changed to Fries, Virginia and officially incorporated in 1902. In 1904, he was elected president of the North Carolina Bankers Association. From 1911‚Äì1912 Fries served as the president of the trust company section of the American Bankers Association. On November 15, 1917 he was appointed to be director of the state branch of the National War Savings Committee. Fries died on June 5, 1931.

She opposed traditional academic art, rebelled against academism and followed radical contemporary art trends in post-war Germany. Through her work she is related with the concept of artists from the post-war modernity (Abstract expressionism, Fluxus, Informalism, Tachisme) as well as the Nouveau R√©alisme group of artists, such as Niki de Saint-Phalle, Jean Tinguely, Arman as well as Daniel Spoerri.cf. S. Partsch, AKL, World Biographical Dictionary of Artists, vol. 75. De Gruyter Saur, Berlin, 2012-13. Life H√ºnerfauth was born on 31 December 1907 in Donaueschingen, a daughter of a brewery manager. After a fire in 1914, her family moved to Munich. In 1917 H√ºnerfauth attended a class on drawing for adults. During her school time in 1923 she underwent practical training in shop window design in a fashion shop and continued this training from 1925 until 1928. From 1925 until 1928, she attended the Female Labor School in Munich and from 1929 until 1932 she attended the Arts School for Design in Munich as a student under Helmuth Ehmcke. In 1933 H√ºnerfauth married the lawyer Wilhelm Sch√§fer, with whom she had a son. From 1935 until 1937 she studied painting at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich under Professor Jank and Professor Hess. In 1938 H√ºnerfauth divorced Sch√§fer and moved to the Dachauer Moos near Munich. In 1939 she married her second husband, Jost H√∂pker, but they divorced soon afterwards.Irma H√ºnerfauth, Peter Lufft and Christoph Wiedemann. IRMAnipulations, p. 119. Publisher Antje Kunstmann, Munich, 1990. In 1940, H√ºnerfauth returned to live with her parents in Grosshesselohe near Munich. In 1942, she was evacuated to Chiemsee and later to the area of Landshut. In 1945, the family returned to Grosshesselohe, where H√ºnerfauth built an atelier. On 20 November 1948, she married her third husband, Franz F√ºhrer, also known by his artist's name \\"F√ºhrer-Wolkenstein\\". They remained married for 28 years. Franz F√ºhrer worked as a construction manager for the public utilities of Munich. As an artist, F√ºhrer-Wolkenstein worked closely with H√ºnerfauth and assisted her with detailed electrotechnical work for her multimedia art projects. After his retirement he created kinetic art objects, so-called recycling machines. In 1954 H√ºnerfauth received private training from Conrad Westpfahl, an important artist of Informal Art, which led her to abstract painting. In 1958 she attended courses on etching and lithography. In 1959, she was awarded the Prix d'Unions des Femmes Peintres in Paris for her painting titled D√ºsternis (Gloom). Two female artists (Lentz and Strauss) expressed their disapproval and one of them cut her painting with a knife. H√ºnerfauth had it restored.Irma H√ºnerfauth, Peter Lufft and Christoph Wiedemann. IRMAnipulations, p. 120. Publisher Antje Kunstmann, Munich, 1990. The art critic Franz Roh and his wife Juliane Roh were early supporters and patrons of H√ºnerfauth's work. They encouraged her and featured her work very positively in their publications. When Franz Roh died, H√ºnerfauth printed a series of ten lithographs In Memory of Franz Roh, 1966. In 1962, she attended a course on welding and subsequently began to sculpt in scrap metal. In 1964 she received the advancement award from the Herbstsalon M√ºnchen (Autumn exhibition Art Salon Munich). In 1965, H√ºnerfauth founded the \\"Gruppe K\\" (Group K) in Munich,Gruppe K, Mappenwerk, 12 Originalgrafiken der Gruppe K, Munich, 1965. together with the artists Walter Raum (1923‚Äì2009), Dieter St√∂ver (1924‚Äì1988) and Hans Joachim Strauch. In 1966 she was awarded the Medaille de Bronze de la Ville de Paris. In 1968/69 H√ºnerfauth turned away from painting. She created her first projects for exhibitions with the artists of Gruppe K (Group K) to be seen at the Haus der Kunst (House of Arts) Munich, called the optical-acoustic collage for piano and speakers; and together with her husband she created vibrational objects from 1971 onwards. In 1972, she created her first 'sprechende K√§sten' (speaking boxes) on the themes of loneliness, first love and war. All of these objects required detailed technical attention. F√ºhrer-Wolkenstein, who also invented an earthing contact tester, was her partner for those technical art projects. He was cautious, thoughtful and intense while she was spontaneous with an intensive willingness and a strong impulse for her decisions, so they complemented each other's temper.Irma H√ºnerfauth, Peter Lufft and Christoph Wiedemann. IRMAnipulations, p. 56. Publisher Antje Kunstmann, Munich, 1990. On 25 November 1976 F√ºhrer- Wolkenstein died. H√ºnerfauth built a funerary monument for him out of scrap metal at the cemetery of Pullach in Munich. Then, H√ºnerfauth started to specialize in so called \\"Artist's Prayer Books\\" in the 1980s and 1990s, which she created from micro-electronic scrap. The use of these materials as well as the construction of the so-called \\"speaking boxes\\" were unique and distinguished her from other object artists of that time. In 1990 H√ºnerfauth was awarded the Schwabinger Kunstpreis in Munich. On 12 November 1998 she died in Kreuth (Tegernsee). Career H√ºnerfauth began her career as a figurative painter. Her early work features bold and unexpected perspectives and an unusual coloration. Franz Roh said that her concentration was on neither a picturesque tachism nor a graphically linear constructivism, but that she should be understood between those. Her style of painting was a \\"highly individual crossing of tranquillity and mobility in the picture\\".Irma H√ºnerfauth, Peter Lufft and Christoph Wiedemann. IRMAnipulations, p. 9, p. 53. Publisher Antje Kunstmann, Munich, 1990. She experimented with unusual tools, such as the use of a dentist's drill for a series of drypoint prints. Her teacher Conrad Westpfahl, a renowned artist of Informal Art, led her develop into an abstract painter. She advanced her mixed media technique with collages and applications from different materials. Next she started to tinker and construct and since then worked three-dimensionally only. The following realized objects (scrap sculptures, metal collages (assemblage), etc.) connected her work with the Nouveaux Realistes group.cf. S. Partsch, AKL, World Biographical Dictionary of Artists, vol. 75. De Gruyter Saur, Berlin, 2012-13. H√ºnerfauth always titled her work with the term IRMAnipulations, a word creation which was invented during an exhibition at the Goethe Institut in London in 1983 and kept by the artist as a kind of trademark. One of the most important retrospective exhibitions of her oeuvre titled \\"Irma H√ºnerfauth ‚Äì IRMAnipulations\\" was held from 3 August until 2 September 1990 in the town hall of Munich. Painting Untitled, 1964. Painting Cat, 1929. Watercoulor At the beach, 1957. Watercoulor H√ºnerfauth's artistic career began as a painter. At first she was taught in the craft of painting during a solid traditional academic training under the professors Jank and Hess at the Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste (Academy of Fine Arts) in Munich. Thus at first, H√ºnerfauth painted figurative landscapes (e.g., Isartalbahnhof, 1938) and portraits, mostly from her familial environment (e.g., Familie H√ºnerfauth, 1946) and if she had followed that norm, she would have become a respectable painter of the post-impressionism style. But indeed, even the paintings of her early period featured their own signature style. Occasionally, expressionistic elements can be found, for example the wildly moved landscape forms in the painting \\"Pupplinger Au\\" (1950) or \\"Mother and Son\\" (1952), which show strong emotional movement and deepness. The first mentioned owes much to Edvard Munch \\"The Scream\\" (1892). From 1954, under the influence of Conrad Westpfahl, she began painting abstractly. One of her last paintings, Winter in Gries (1958), forgoes perspective entirely and conventionalizes the buildings to abstract areas. Now, she wanted to remove all the decorative art elements completely. Her paintings of the following years can be described as consequent as well as radical. She \\"attempts to bring the inventive impulse to an inner equilibrium by supporting it with a meditative character. Together the severity of the order and the softness of the whole gain the dramatic power of a dialogue. The dialogue lends movement and a facetting to the surface which seems haunted by a kind of dream\\".cf. Conrad Westpfahl. In: Irma H√ºnerfauth, exh. cat., Bruckmann, Munich, 1960. On the other hand, strong emotions are expressed abstractly, with a chaotic mixup of brushstrokes, an excessive frenzy of colors, vigorous and in a rough-textured style, as in her mixed media composition Untitled (1963). Occasionally her mostly large-sized paintings owe much to abstract Expressionism and the pioneers of Action painting, such as Jackson Pollock, Joan Mitchell, Grace Hartigan, and Helen Frankenthaler. Her work is sometimes playful, as in the painting \\"16.1.1963\\" (1963), and sometimes experimental as in the painting The red Infamy (1966), in which she fixated metal wires through the canvas similar to a collage. Her abstract painting unites emotional expressiveness with graphic rigor. In 1969, she painted the \\"letzte Bild\\" (last picture ‚Äì 1969/1989). It features a painted perforated metal plate on which emotional impulses run riot as if they were driven by electronic force. In the right corner, one can spot a drain plug with a chain simply fixated on canvas, a find, a piece of scrap that profanely ironizes the whole utopian and playfully futuristic portrayal, just like the subject that seems to be placed somewhere between space and earth. She expresses herself on the canvas playfully, headstrong, sometimes curious but also visionary. However, it seems that even the surface of a large canvas has become too small, as a suitable playing field of her present intentions. She had already built her first sculptural objects and she seemed to concentrate on one form of expression, eventually it should be working in the three- dimensional form.Irma H√ºnerfauth, Peter Lufft and Christoph Wiedemann. IRMAnipulations, p. 9. Publisher Antje Kunstmann, Munich, 1990. After \\"letzte Bild\\" she unexpectedly stopped painting and left only a relatively small oeuvre of pictures (Wilhelm Sch√§fer counts only 45 paintings which remained in the artist's estate, excluding watercolors and drawings). The turning away from painting marked the end of the sixties and was symptomatically for lots of other contemporary artists, too. H√ºnerfauth wanted to experiment, just as artists like her did it at that time. She partly returned to figurative painting, for example in sketches of her three-dimensional work and also later as she painted the picture \\"Mutter auf dem Weg zur Urmutter\\" (Mother becomes primordial mother, 1981). The bilious green plate before blue, about 1995. Metal collage (Assemblage) Madam and 3 masks, 1973. Mixed media War animals suffer, too. Speaking box, 1986 The death of the biker, 1989. Speaking object/ Installation Metal collages (Assemblage) on the exterior facade of the artist's house Prints The development of her printed graphic work evolved parallel to her painting and eventually became experimental. During her early period, H√ºnerfauth made figurative drawings and watercolors in the style of the academic tradition, but even her sketch-like work already featured an expressive verve. Then she worked with a dentist's drill on the plates for a series of drypoints. She made linoleum cuts, lithographs and etchings. Most of these prints she printed in very small editions. She made embossed prints, also named scrap embossing, in editions of one only; these were appliqued with pieces of metal or cloth. Her Picasso-variations, inspired by the campaign 'Picassoanmalen (overpainting Picasso)' from the Engelhorn foundation Munich, were an ironical statement to the gallery owner Peter Luft who often expressed that her intentions resembled Picasso's. These are Pablo Picasso reproduction posters which she simply overpainted. Also notable is the already mentioned folder in memory of Franz Roh, a tribute which emphasizes friendship, closeness, and death. Works=Single-handed exhibition catalogs / artist diaries The artist began to design her first exhibition catalogs in 1978. These are some kind of a retrospective, fashioned after an artist's diary, made out of collage-like paste ins of cutouts from earlier regular exhibition brochures and press reports. These catalogs have about 50 sheets each (measurements about 20 by 23 centimeters), which she fixated together with two sturdy brass screws. The exact edition is unknown. These artist diaries are related to FLUXUS books and have to be seen as independent works. Speaking boxes and objects The first so-called \\"sprechende K√§sten\\" (speaking boxes) she created in 1972. These are unique in their kind and not to be found by other object artists of that time. The boxes contain different objects, technical scrap which is moved motor-driven or commented acoustically with the help of an audio tape at the touch of a button. The artist developed her own manuals for these objects: 'The game begins. Grasp at the bafle collector and pull the ball down several times. At the same time you will see how the objects in the box slowly fluctuate according to their self- oscillation similar as a blast of air quietly moves the nature. Breathe deeply, keep playing with the pellets, listen, take up your thoughts, take the freedom to dream, forget your everyday life. Break away from the 'correctness' of the society, break away from the 'correctness' of the criticism, break away from the 'correctness' of science. All these are overrated correctnesses. Breathe deeply, play yourselves free, just be yourself.\\" Irma H√ºnerfauth \\"Ulmer Theater. 12.10.‚Äì15.11.1980.' Gebilde aus Metall und Kram, cat., Ulm 1980. With these objects H√ºnerfauth portrays comprehensive human and ideological thoughts as everyday occurrences: the misery of war and its phenomena, the loneliness living in mass towers and building blocks of our satellite towns ('from countless windows eyes stare into emptiness'). She shows shivering grass and first love, demonstrations (the 'Occammensch') and nature idyll, philosophy and humor ('Glasknopfb√§umchen'). An example of these speaking boxes is the box Blaue Pistole (Blue Pistol) which she created in 1973. It is filled with industrial scrap. Its endless audio tape plays the artist's voice reciting a text by Meta Kristall: \\"Blue pistol used with pleasure by a boy's hand, now rotten as scrap in the landscape, a butterfly rocking itself on it. Sharp gunshots invade Sunday's peace, like chocolates invade the affluent societies puss, maneuver drill a man says promising.\\" Another box she crafted in 1983 is made from plexiglass with a collaged back cover. The audio tape with H√ºnerfauth's voice is urging with music and a text by Meta Kristall: \\"War! Your voice is the otherman dead, man shoot the otherman'. Otherman shoot...' Shots are fired, Meta Kristall is crying out: \\"Dead! Dead! Let the murdering be! Talk to the otherman .. Otherman talks to you...\\" Another major work is the PopArt related speaking object \\"Emanze\\" (Women's libber, 1990) which is brightly coloured on both front and back as well as Krieg ‚Äì auch Tiere leiden (War animals suffer too, 1986) and also the three-dimensional installation Rocker's Tod (The death of the biker, 1989). The artist and gallery owner Peter Luft said H√ºnerfauth's art resembles Picasso's in spirit, wit, irony, simplicity, cogency and excursiveness. However, Luft believes that the artist transcends Picasso's stylistic devices precisely with the complexity of her speaking boxes: \\"The circle of her style is, as I feel, related to Picasso's. Of course, the shape is different; and so are the materials. While Picasso remains a painter and drawer, a designer of the surface, during most of his works, Irma H√ºnerfauth stepped out of the two- dimensionality to never to return. She is working three-dimensionally, in a sphere and sculpturesque. She is driving frottages coming from the graphics, ferro-montages coming from the sculptures. She loves ready-mades, combine painting and material pictures ‚Äì just like Picasso. But beyond all this, she loves and practices: Contre-reliefs, machine arts, Objet trouv√© and especially bruitism, which means the mixed medial synthesis of audio, literature, kinetics and at the same time theatrical staging. With presentations of this kind she is leaving Picasso far behind.\\" Irma H√ºnerfauth, Peter Lufft and Christoph Wiedemann. IRMAnipulations, p. 64, p. 67. Publisher Antje Kunstmann, Munich, 1990. Kinetic vibrational objects Beginning in the 1970s, she created so-called vibrational objects. These are wires, buttons, cartridges; electrical panels and other finds, that intone music of the spheres at the touch of a button. Through these interactive dynamics the access to her poetic concept is eased for art lovers; nevertheless, she says, \\"my work must seem as abstruse to the majority of our society\\". Continuing with her words: \\"These vibrational objects are supposed to topple the fine and precious. Imagine this takes place at a jeweler's shop. The viewer is confronted with a composition falling apart. They are constructed with the purpose to cause the elements to shiver by touching a button. They are supposed to experience the discomfort of the destruction of the beautiful\\".Irma H√ºnerfauth, Peter Lufft and Christoph Wiedemann. IRMAnipulations, p. 56. Publisher Antje Kunstmann, Munich, 1990. Ferro-montages, Metal collages (Assemblage)  H√ºnerfauth's ferro-montages (a word invented by the artist) invaded a traditionally male artist's reserved domain.Irma H√ºnerfauth, Peter Lufft and Christoph Wiedemann. IRMAnipulations, p. 59. Publisher Antje Kunstmann, Munich, 1990. These are sculptures made from wealth garbage and scrap, like nickel-plated chrome carparts, bumpers, radiator hoods, steel ribs, steel discs, large threads, pipes, axle bearings and more. They are high-gloss objects, head-high figures and creations, which she assembled or welded together with the help of her husband. These artworks are reminiscent of religious cultural objects. The first of them ‚Äì made in the late 1960s ‚Äì are smaller sized bronze sculptures on a base or small table, and include ready-mades. Then, the figures became larger, for example the Iron- respectively Sunflower made from agricultural machine parts, Portrait of J.W.K. on a head-high column (grooved), Serpentina, Portrait of Mrs. Heller and especially impressive 'I'nstance (1977), Black Butterfly so as the admonisher Ma(h)nuel ‚Äì all free-standing statuary art. The most important of these ferro-montages bears the press-given title Occam-Mensch (Occam Human) and can be seen as her major artwork. The two meters high sculpture with gas mask, opened lungs and many symbolic exhaust pipes was created from original machine parts in 1971. It was exhibited publicly that year on the corner of Occam Street in Schwabing, a borough in the northern part of Munich. At that time the newspaper named it Occammensch (Occam human) and partly ridiculed his message. In 1990, about twenty years later, it was exhibited publicly again at the Gasteig in Munich (borough Haidhausen). It was favorably received and was printed as a poster. With this sculpture the artist wants to draw attention to climate protection and the air pollution by carbon monoxide in big cities. In the plinth with hand written ironic slogan as an wordplay \\"STATT LUFT ‚Äì STADTLUFT (Instead of air ‚Äì big city atmosphere 'smog')\\". Declared as \\"unsaleable\\", it accompanied the artist over decades and was reworked by the artist several times. Then she created relief-like, more two-dimensional compositions, named metal collage (Assemblage). These were one by two meter metal plates which she decorated with scrap and finds. Some of these metal collages (Assemblage) she mounted temporarily on the exterior facade of her own house to expose them to weather and so natural corrosion. The applied materials she used to call \\"way too beautiful scrap\\". In this category also her idols are noteworthy, especially the G√∂tzin mit Klingelbusen ( female tin god with ringing breasts), a metallically fixated female breast picture the nipples of which were made from pushable metal bell buttons. At the plinth panel with a verse from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: \\"The girl's breast in the hand, the doorbell on the wall, are related. Both reveal that downstairs outside there is someone urgently begging for admittance\\". Artist‚Äòs prayer books made of micro electronic scrap After the death of her husband, H√ºnerfauth concentrated on smaller objects because these were easier to handle by herself. She created artist's prayer books by processing micro electronical scrap, garbage from computer hardware, electronic conductors and slim-sized control panels into small-dimensioned metal collages (Assemblage). The usage of this kind of material has to be regarded as unique. The objects are now 'silent objects' again. Their small formats force to observe and face H√ºnerfauth‚Äòs formal, graphic and physical means and possibilities. The manner of structuring prompts the viewer to a behavior she asked for during the viewing of her early abstract painting, when she told the viewers in January 1960: \\"Get into the painting by scanning it with your eyes, the lines will lead you. I wish for the viewers to step out of themselves during the dialogue with the artwork and to newly find themselves in another sphere of conscience.\\"Irma H√ºnerfauth, Peter Lufft and Christoph Wiedemann. IRMAnipulations, p. 60. Publisher Antje Kunstmann, Munich, 1990. The term 'The Artist's Prayer Books' already indicates that these artistic miniatures are meant to be ambiguous and provocative. The term is aiming at a type of text that was especially conceived for women and their intimate orientation towards God in the 19th century. Those books had a particularly magnificent design and were supposed to represent piety in public. The apparent artistry of H√ºnerfauth's 'The Artist's Prayer Books' still reminds of the original meaning, the doxology. H√ºnerfauth led a dialogue with herself and the public's expectations. Also the material (scrap) evokes reflectiveness: is the computer the new god, or the individual? For those who still did not understand, she added a motto to each artist's diary: \\"Don‚Äôt think, wonder yourself!\\" \\"The creative force in the prayer books is so strong that it transforms the material, the application, into one single matter, which is ensouled by the personal view that possesses the same structure like her relief-like idols.\\"Irma H√ºnerfauth, Peter Lufft and Christoph Wiedemann. IRMAnipulations, pp. 61‚Äì62. Publisher Antje Kunstmann, Munich, 1990. H√ºnerfauth is a postwar artist of the so-called \\"lost generation\\", whose artworks sold mostly directly to private as well as public collections and thus seldom appeared at international art events or on the auction market during her lifetime.cf.

They were founder members of Cumann na mBan.  Biographies  Emily and Eil√≠s were born in Tonagh near Glasson in Co. Westmeath. They were born to farmer Peter Elliott and Margaret Berry. They had sisters: Ethel, Theresa, Rebecca and Ethel (Sr. Imelda) and brothers: J.J. (John Joseph), Andrew, Charles, Edward and Arthur. At the time of the rising Eil√≠s was living at Gardiner's Place in Dublin. She is also known as Lizzie. These two sisters were involved with the nationalist movement in Ireland. The women were members of Cumann na mBan, Emily was a member of the Keating branch. Emily wanted to volunteer in the General Post Office, (GPO) and headed into the city with Eil√≠s Ryan. They were turned away from the GPO and sent to Reis's Chambers on the opposite side of O'Connell Street from the GPO during the Easter Rising. The volunteers were trying to ensure the details of the rising got released and the chambers hosted a wireless school. The women were responsible for ensuring the men had rations, which required them crossing O'Connell street while it was under fire more than once. On the second day the two women were joined by Eil√≠s Elliott. The women later served in the Four Courts and in Fr Matthew Hall both in providing rations and first aid support. On the final night and with the assistance of the priests, the women mingled with the congregation from the church and avoided being arrested. Westmeath musician Enda Seery composed a suite of traditional Irish music, A New Ireland in the Orchard Air, to honour the sisters. The council decided to name a new bridge over the River Shannon the Cumman na mBan bridge in honour of the sisters and the organisation. On 7 April 2018, Westmeath County Council organised the renaming of a road in Athlone \\"Elliott Road\\" in honour of two local sisters‚Äô contributions to the Easter Rising. The Mayor of Athlone, Aengus O‚ÄôRourke, unveiled the sign for the newly named Elliott Road. Eilis Elliott's grandson, John McCann, made a speech on behalf of the Elliott family.

Text  The original text was written in Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 23 verses. Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), Codex Leningradensis (1008).

The original building, built in 1903, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. A new facility, with triple the floor space of the old, was opened to the public in 2004. History The public library had its beginnings in 1900 when former resident Walter S. Benton bequeathed $10,000 to buy library books if the city built a library building by 1903. The city and the estate failed to reach an agreement, so the Francis Shaw Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution took over leadership of the effort and raised the necessary funds. Chicago architect Dwight H. Perkins designed the single-story Romanesque Revival-style building that was built of native limestone. The side-gabled structure featured a reading room on one side of the building and the book stacks on the other. A delivery desk was located in the center. with By the 1990s the historic building was becoming too small and technologically insufficient. Ernest J. Buresh, formerly of Anamosa, donated the property for a new library, and the Buresh family also offered $500,000 towards a new library contingent on the community raising a million dollars by December 2002. OPN Architects of Cedar Rapids designed the new building. The necessary funds were raised without a bond referendum. The present library building, also composed of native limestone, was opened on November 8, 2004. The original building now houses the Anamosa Police Department.

A bundle of Mauli A Kautuka is a red- yellow coloured ritual protection thread, sometimes with knots or amulets, found on the Indian subcontinent. It is sometimes called as kalava, mauli, moui, raksasutra, pratisara (in North India), kaapu, kayiru or charandu (in South India). A kautuka is a woven thread, cord or ribbon, states the Indologist Jan Gonda, which is traditionally believed to be protective or apotropaeic. The pratisara and kautuka in a ritual thread context appear in the Vedic text Atharvaveda Samhita section 2.11. An even earlier reference to ritual \\"red and black\\" colored thread with a dual function, one of driving away \\"fiends\\" and the other \\"binding of bonds\\" between the bride and the groom by one's relatives appears in hymn 10.85.28 of the Rigveda, states Gonda., Quote: \\"die Verwandten der Braut binden ihr mit RV 10,85,28 eine rote und schwarze, wollene oder linnene Schnur um: raktakrmam √§vikam ksaumaw v√§ trimanirripratisaram jn√§tayo 'sy√§ badhnanti nllalohitam iti\\" A Hindu Bride holding a kalasha. A red colored kautuka is visible on the neck of the vessel. A pratisara or kautuka serves a ritual role in Hinduism, and is tied by the priest or oldest family member on the wrist of a devotee, patron, loved one or around items such as kalasha or lota (vessel) for a rite-of-passage or yajna ritual. It is the woven thread in the poja thali. It is typically colored a shade of red, sometimes orange, saffron, yellow or is a mixture of these colors. However, it may also be white or wreathe or just stalks of a grass of the types found in other cultures and believed to offer similar apotropaic value. It is typically tied to the wrist or worn like a necklace, but occasionally it may be worn in conjunction with a headband or turban-like gear. Similar threads are tied to various items and the neck of vessels during a Hindu puja ceremony. The ritual thread is traditionally worn on the right wrist or arm by the males and on the left by the females. This thread also plays a role in certain familial and marital ceremonies. For example, a red or golden or similarly colored thread is offered by a sister to her brother at Raksha Bandhan. This thread, states the Indologist Jack Goody, is at once a \\"protection against misfortune for the brother, a symbol of mutual dependence between the sister and brother, and a mark of mutual respect\\". In a Hindu marriage ceremony, this thread is referred to as kautuka in ancient Sanskrit texts. It is tied to both the bride and the groom, as well as household items such as grinding stone, clay pots and fertility symbols. In South India, it is the priest who ties the kaapu (kautuka) on the groom's wrist, while the groom ties the colored thread on the bride's wrist as a part of the wedding rituals. In regional Vaishnavism tradition of Hinduism such as those found in Maharashtra, the red-colored thread symbolizes Vishnu for men, and Lakshmi for women, states the Indologist Gudrun B√ºhnemann. The string typically has no knots or fourteen knots and it is tied to the wrist of the worshipper or garlanded as a necklace. If worn by the wife, it is without knots and is identified with Lakshmi-doraka or Anantƒ´. To the husband, the thread has knots and it symbolizes Ananta (Vishnu). The Shaivism tradition of Hinduism similarly deploys auspicious kautuka (pratisara) threads in puja and consecration rituals. For example, during temple construction and worship rituals, the shilpa Sanskrit texts recommend that the first bricks and the Shiva linga be ritually tied with red-, golden-, saffron- or similarly hued threads. The Shaiva temple architecture texts generally use the term kautuka for this auspicious thread, while Vaishnava texts refer to it as pratisara. The raksasutra (kautuka, pratisara) is also a part of festive ceremonies and processions, where the protective thread is tied to the wrist of festival icons and human participants. It is mentioned in verses 27.206-207 of the Ajitagama, states the Indologist Richard Davis. Some Hindu texts mention these threads to be a part of the rakshabandhana rite for a temple procession and festive celebrations, recommending woven gold, silver or cotton threads, with some texts specifying the number of threads in a kautuka. In Jainism, protective threads with amulets are called raksapotli. Typically red and worn of the wrist, they may sometimes come with a rolled up red fabric that has been blessed by a Jain mendicant using mantras, according to the Indologist M. Whitney Kelting. If worn on the neck, states Kelting, the Jain tradition names the protective amulet after the Jain deity whose blessing is believed to be tied into the knot. The ritual significance of a protective thread between the sisters and brothers as well as during Jain weddings is similar to those in Hinduism.

'Joe.' \\", HCO, Vanity Fair, 3 March 1910 Programme for Venice in London, Olympia, 1891‚Äì93 The blue plaque to Lyons at 11a Palace Mansions, Hammersmith Road, London Sir Joseph Nathaniel Lyons DL (29 December 1847 ‚Äì 22 June 1917) was the chairman of J. Lyons and Co., a restaurant chain, food manufacturing and hotel conglomerate created in 1884 that dominated British mass-catering in the first half of the twentieth century. Early life Lyons was born in Kennington, London, on 29 December 1847, the son of Nathaniel Lyons, \\"an itinerant vendor of watches and cheap jewellery\\", and Hannah Cohen, his wife. He was educated at the Borough Jewish Schools in London's East End.The Coronation Year. W. H. Allen & Co., London, 1914. pp. 447‚Äì448. Early career Lyons began his career as an optician's apprentice. He had an ingenious mechanical bent and invented small gadgets that he was able to sell quickly at the many exhibitions held throughout Great Britain in the late nineteenth century, using his skills in showmanship and sales. One was a combined \\"microscope-binocular-compass\\" that he sold for one shilling from a stall at the Royal Jubilee Exhibition Liverpool in 1887. Catering When Isidore Gluckstein (1851‚Äì1920), Montague Gluckstein (1854‚Äì1922) and Barnett Salmon (1829‚Äì1897), who headed the Salmon & Gluckstein tobacco merchants, wanted to expand into catering, they invited Lyons to join them but used his name for the company, as they thought that associating their family names with catering would be beneath them; Lyons was distantly related to Isidore Gluckstein's fianc√©e. A trial tea pavilion was run at the Newcastle Jubilee Exhibition of 1887 which was so successful that in that year a private company was incorporated to develop the business. The company took space at the 1888 International Exhibition of Science, Art and Industry in Glasgow and the Exposition Universelle of 1889 in Paris, after which it took over catering at Olympia (1891), the Crystal Palace, and the White City, all in London. A public company, J. Lyons & Co. Ltd., was formed in 1894 and the first Lyons' teashop was opened that year in Piccadilly, London, which eventually grew into a chain known as Lyons' Corner Houses. Lyons was made chairman of the company for life. He was chairman of the Strand Palace Hotel, part of the Lyons and Gluckstein interests, where he introduced a \\"no-tip\\" policy to great success. Exhibitions Around 1891, Lyons met Harold Hartley, an entrepreneurial publisher and mineral water manufacturer. As Hartley told it in his memoirs, Eighty-eight: Not Out (1939): > One evening later on Lyons, who had never travelled, asked me if I had ever > been to Venice, as he had an idea that it might be reproduced with its > canals in an attractive form. Being well acquainted with Venice, I at once > realised its possibilities and thus \\"Venice in London\\" was born. Visions of > the Grand Canal, with its churches, palaces, and gondolas flashed through my > mind.\\"Mr. Harold Hartley.\\" The Times, 28 July 1939, p. 19. Between 1891 and 1893 they staged Venice in London at Olympia which combined catering by Lyons, entertainments and opportunities to purchase souvenirs with a stage show designed and directed by the theatrical impresario Imre Kiralfy who specialised in spectacular events and lent his name to the production to increase its appeal to the public.\\"Olympia Corporate History 1884‚Äì1999\\".

Personal life Lyons married Psyche Cohen, the daughter of Isaac Cohen, who was the manager of the Pavilion Theatre in London's Whitechapel Road. They did not have any children. He was an accomplished watercolourist who showed his paintings at the Royal Institution where they were bought by Sir Spencer Wells, surgeon to Queen Victoria, and Admiral Earldey-Wilmot, commander of the Channel Fleet. He also wrote short novels with the dramatist Cecil Raleigh. He was a member of the General Purposes Committee of the Territorial Association and was responsible for adding athletics to the Territorial Army's training regime. His charitable activity was directed to the Little Sisters of the Poor in London's Hammersmith, and the Music Hall Benevolent Fund. Honours Lyons was a Deputy Lieutenant of the County of London. His firm catered for royal garden parties at Buckingham Palace and enjoyed a royal warrant. He was knighted for public services in 1911. Death and legacy Lyons died at the Hyde Park Hotel, Knightsbridge, on 22 June 1917 and was buried at the cemetery of the United Synagogue, Willesden. He was survived by his wife and is remembered in a blue plaque at 11a Palace Mansions, Hammersmith Road, West Kensington, London, inscribed \\"Sir Joseph Lyons 1847‚Äì1917 Pioneer of mass catering lived here\\".

Genealogical Publishing Com, 2009, p.256 in Savannah, Georgia, it has gone on to become one of the world's largest manufacturers of commercial truck trailers.http://www.coachbuilt.com/bui/g/great_dane/great_dane.htmhttps://greatdane.com/history  History =1900s to 1930s Great Dane was founded as the Savannah Blow Pipe Co. in Savannah, Georgia, in 1900, fabricating sheet metal systems to move sawdust and woodchips in saw mills and woodwork plants. By 1916, Great Dane manufactured diverse steel plate and structural steel products and systems. Changing its name to reflect that, it became the Steel Products Co. In 1920, the company moved to a 10,000 sq. ft. building on Lathrop Ave. It remained here for almost a century where its employees worked alongside a 10-ton traveling crane and power tools for cutting and punching to operate the steelwork and blacksmith facilities. During the Great Depression, which started in 1929 and continued into the 1930s, Roosevelt‚Äôs New Deal called for highways to be modified and rebuilt, giving jobs to thousands of struggling Americans. This was an opportunity for the Steel Products Co. to grow by designing and manufacturing trailers for over-the-road freight hauling. To improve their road trailer, the company hired a team of experienced trailer builders. The trailers designed by the team were called Great Danes, after the dogs. The first trailers to be created were flatbeds but by 1934, both tank trailers and enclosed vans were added to the roster. At this point in history, every state had some form of regulation for the size and weight of trucks traveling on highways. Great Dane's solution was to use thin, strong high- tensile steel to make the trailers lighter. 1940s to 1960s During WWII, Great Dane was called upon to produce heavy-duty trailers. Throughout the war, America had been growing its own fruits and vegetables at home to be able to conserve and send more food to the soldiers overseas. After the war, demand for fresh fruits and vegetables was high. This led to the year 1947, which saw the first of many refrigerated trailers, more commonly known as reefers. Originally created as a cooled produce van, the trailer used a wet ice bunker and a gas engine blower system. It was quickly followed by Great Dane‚Äôs official line of Sno-Zone Reefers. The 1950s saw change for the company. When Eisenhower signed the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act in 1956, the federal government began regulating truck size and weight. Once the Interstate Highway System was established, Great Dane was challenged to build longer and bigger trailers, while continuously making them lighter. The company responded with the aluminum van trailer and tandem axle, which was utilized across the nation. By the mid-50s, the company had sales outlets throughout the Eastern United States, located in 31 cities in 18 states. In 1958, the company officially changed its title from the Steel Products Co. to Great Dane Trailers, Inc. The original signature dog oval was black, but officially rebranded to red to commemorate the changing of the name. The 1960s were full of alternate transportation opportunities. By 1961, Great Dane joined the railroad industry, manufacturing its first piggyback trailer for easier transportation of goods. It also completed its first order of maritime containers in 1963 for the American shipping industry. 1970s to 1990s In 1972, Great Dane purchased an all-platform trailer manufacturing location in Memphis, Tennessee, from Arrow Trailer. In 1974, Great Dane grew even further by building a manufacturing plant in Brazil, Indiana, that originally focused solely on vans and the western/mid-western business spheres. In the present day, the plant is focused on specialty work as well as reefers and dry freight vans. Brazil is still Great Dane's largest manufacturing facility. That year also marked the completion of the 10,000 square foot Savannah Engineering Research Lab built for testing of design and construction, which allowed the facility to double production. The idea of expansion and improvement became the new motto to inspire the company to make changes. In 1982, Great Dane installed computer-controlled road simulation equipment that the Research and Development Lab in Savannah, Georgia, still uses today. It is the only one of its kind still in operation. In 1988, Great Dane acquired the SuperSeal reefer production line and plant in Wayne, Nebraska. This addition created the broadest line for reefers in the entire industry. Great Dane officially expanded internationally during the 1980s. In 1996, Great Dane opened a dry van plant in Terre Haute, Indiana, as well as an adjacent parts distribution center. The merger the next year of Great Dane and Pines Trailer created the Great Dane Limited Partnership, making it one of the world‚Äôs largest trailer companies. By 1999, Great Dane completely updated its branch locations with the expansion of the Little Rock, Arkansas, sales office to a full-service branch. 2000s to Present In 2002, Great Dane purchased Strick‚Äôs Eastern Van manufacturing facilities in Danville, Pennsylvania, and the Trailmobile manufacturing facilities in Jonesboro, Arkansas. By 2004, Great Dane had acquired a production facility in Huntsville, Tennessee, from Wabash National Corporation and went into production one year later. The Memphis, Tennessee, plant closed in 2005. In 2006, Great Dane reached a major milestone. Over the course of the year, Great Dane was able to produce 60,000 trailers across nine different plants. In January 2009, Great Dane closed its original manufacturing plant in Savannah, Georgia, that had been open since 1919 due to the economic hit the company took during the recession. In 2010, Great Dane made changes to its complete product line and century-old brand. A new reefer plant was opened in Statesboro, Georgia, to expand manufacturing. Great Dane also acquired Johnson Refrigerated Truck Bodies. A change in leadership was made in 2011 as President and COO Phil Pines retired from the company after more than 50 years of service in the trailer industry. He was replaced by current president Dean Engelage. In 2011, the name of the company was officially changed from ‚ÄúGreat Dane Trailers‚Äù to simply ‚ÄúGreat Dane‚Äù to encompass the full line of transportation solutions Great Dane offers beyond simply trailers. By 2016, Great Dane had introduced two new truck body designs: The Alpine and The Sahara. Great Dane grew even further in 2016 with the opening of a new plant in Elysburg, Pennsylvania, for dry van manufacturing.  Products  Trailer production began for Great Dane in the 1930s. Great Dane‚Äôs significant manufacturing and product improvements have impacted the motor carrier industry. In 1931, the Savannah Blowpipe Company decided to design and manufacture truck trailers for over-the-road freight hauling. The first Great Dane trailers built by Steel Products Company were 16- to 20-foot-long flatbed trailers, with single axles and payload capacities of three to six tons. Great Dane entered the piggyback and container market, completing its first piggyback trailer order in 1961 and its first maritime container order in 1963. The Steel Products Company produced about 12,000 trailers on government contracts during World War II. In 1980, Great Dane installed computer-controlled Road Simulation Equipment in the Research and Development facility located at the Savannah, Georgia, plant. This was followed closely by the use of Finite Element Analysis software, key in achieving desired strength-to-weight designs. During 1979, Great Dane installed Space Age Simulation Equipment in the Research and Development Lab. Great Dane‚Äôs engineering capability was greatly enhanced by the installation of CADCAM Computer Graphics. Robotics was introduced into the Memphis plant for welding operations to which plasma arch cutting would eventually be added. In 1985, the first FRP panels were produced at the Composite Panel facility in Brazil. Refrigerated The Steel Products Company pioneered the refrigerated trailer field. SuperSeal reefers created the broadest line of reefers in the industry, and early refrigerated trailers made long-distance shipping of fruits and vegetables possible. By 1953, refrigerated aluminum trailers were in demand for use in the Florida perishables market and became the standard for the eastern United States. The first insulated and cooled trailer dates back to the early 1940s, when the company built the first produce van that was equipped with a wet ice bunker powered by a gas engine- and-blower system. The first reefer trailers were all steel in the 1940s, around the end of the war. The early 1950s saw further advancements and new trends. Great Dane‚Äôs new ‚Äúoval-nose‚Äù reefer was streamlined for airflow, but this design was eventually discontinued due to the shape and placement of reefer units. Also popular was the ‚Äúunderslung‚Äù reefer unit, which was located in the belly of the trailer. In the late 1950s, Great Dane was continuing to explore new reefer innovations. For example, a dry ice reefer was introduced, although they were very unusual and were only built for about a year. While the trailer sold well, dry ice was rare and hard to find. The 1950s was the decade of reefers. In the late 1950s, Great Dane introduced the Dual Temp reefer which allowed frozen food to be held in the rear and produce in the front. Also in the 1950s, Great Dane introduced the early nose mount Thermo King Reefer units. Insulation for trailers during the time period consisted of block Styrofoam, just like that used in coolers, which was hand-fitted and lined with plywood. Dry Freight By 1934, the Great Dane line also included tank trailers and an enclosed trailer van. In 1938, the Steel Products Company responded to the new opportunity that came from economic pressure and the advent of highway weight laws aimed at haulers by creating lightweight tank trailers and van trailers made of high-tensile steel. A stressed skin van of exceptionally lightweight design became the principle Great Dane product. Production of straight frame, aluminum and FRP dry freight vans began at the Brazil facility in mid-1974, increasing the refrigerated van capacity of the Savannah plant. In 2002, Great Dane demonstrated huge strides in engineering and technology when the SSL dry freight van was added to the product line. The SSL‚Äôs patented design offers steel-lined interior walls. Of Great Dane‚Äôs dry freight sales in 2006, more than 20,000 trailers were SSL models, accounting for nearly 15 percent of the industry‚Äôs total shipments in 2006. Flatbed Great Dane offers three models of flatbed trailers: The all-steel Freedom SE; the steel-aluminum combo Freedom LT; and the all- aluminum Freedom XP. Truck Bodies Great Dane offers three lines of truck bodies: The Sahara dry freight truck body series, the Alpine refrigerated truck body and the Johnson Series line of composite refrigerated truck bodies. There are two models of Sahara truck bodies: The composite plate Sahara C-Series and the sheet-and-post Sahara S-Series. The Johnson Series line consists of three refrigerated composite truck bodies: The Johnson C-Series, the Johnson R-Series and the Johnson S-Series.

Awards, Milestones and Recognition  In 1943, the Army-Navy ‚ÄúE‚Äù Production Award was given to the men and women of The Steel Products Co., Inc. for Excellence in War Production. The Army Navy E for excellence was awarded to the company five separate times for its outstanding products used during WWII. Great Dane designed a commemorative logo to promote its 100th year in business in 2000. In 2006, an all-time company record was set with more than 60,000 trailers shipped from Great Dane's nine factories. Nearly 33 percent of the market demand for refrigerated vans and more than 28 percent of the market demand for all dry freight vans were fulfilled by Great Dane. Of Great Dane's dry freight sales in 2006, more than 20,000 trailers were SSL models, accounting for nearly 15 percent of the industry's total shipments in 2006. In 2006, Great Dane received Pressure Systems International‚Äôs (PSI) Customer Excellence Award. Great Dane celebrated its 100,000th trailer made in 2012 out of the manufacturing plant in Terre Haute, Indiana. In 2016, Great Dane received accreditation from the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) for its service technician training program. Great Dane has won 38 Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association (TTMA) Plant Safety Awards since the TTMA Plant Safety Contest began in 1971.

Harm previously represented the Netherlands men's national water polo team and gave Oliver his size, as he stands 2.08 metres (6 ft 10 in) tall.https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/international/oliver-jager-from- the-sct-to-rubbing-shoulders-with-kieran-read-1.2554579 Jager travelled to New Zealand in 2013 to attend the Crusaders International High Performance Unit and subsequently turned out for the Crusaders Academy and the Crusaders Knights development team. During this time he also started playing club rugby in the Canterbury area with New Brighton RFC Senior career Jager's dedication in coming to New Zealand in order to further his rugby career paid off in 2016, when great form at club level saw him named in the Canterbury squad for the Mitre 10 Cup. With the Cantabrians already possessing Super Rugby props in the shape of Alex Hodgman, Siate Tokolahi and Daniel Lienert- Brown, Jager's appearances in his first season were largely limited to cameos from the replacements bench. He started once and came on as a replacement seven times as his side lifted the Premiership trophy for the 8th time in 9 seasons. Super Rugby His debut season at provincial level saw him coached by Canterbury legend Scott Robertson and like his coach, Jager found himself promoted to Super Rugby level in 2017, earning a contract with the Crusaders.

She was bought out of a brothel and became a successful actress. Life Xuan was born in Shanghai in 1907 when her name was Tian Jinlin. She was brought up in a family that was so poor that her mother sold her to a brothel in order that her elder siblings might eat. She had little education and was described as barely literate. In the 1935 film \\"Little Friend\\" (Madame Shen (Xuan Jinglin, second left) introduces her brother-in-law to a bright young boy (Zhang Xiaoqiu) she has brought home as a substitute for her lost son)list of films, Chinese Mirror, Retrieved 5 November 2016 She was discovered by Zhang Shichuan. He had seen her as a child in an amusement park where he was the manager. He later re-found her and offered her a small part in a now lost film. He liked her acting and bought her out of the brothel so that she could act in films by the Mingxing Film Company. This was then a small company that he was a director of, and from May 1925 she had parts in Mingxing films as both her, and the company's, fortunes improved. Her stage name was devised by Zheng Zhengqiu who based it on the name she had adopted in the brothel and a transliteration of Lillian Gish into Shanghainese.Zhang Zhen, An Amorous History of the Silver Screen : Shanghai Cinema, 1896-1937, The University of Chicago Press, 2006, , , cited in Jennifer M. Bean and Diane Negra, A Feminist Reader in Early Cinema (Duke University Press, , pages 510-526. Her second film, A Woman in Shanghai, was devised for her and echoed her own Cinderella story. She played a prostitute who is rescued by a millionaire. She was not typecast, and she played a female gangster, an innocent country girl, a dancer and a poor widow in 1920s Mingxing films. In 1930 Mingxing Films invested its profits from the epic (27 hour) martial arts films The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple in a new studio. This new technology is featured in their 1930/1931 film \\"An Amorous History of the Silver Screen\\" which features Xuan. The film has been described as \\"self- referential docudrama\\" as it tells the story of a prostitute who becomes an actress. The film is also seen as showing a new relationship with technology as the early romance is superseded by the technology. Xuan plays again a prostitute in a film with the film and she strikes back at her attacker. This act within the film is seen, by Zhang Zhen, as emblematic of a change in the film's story and the actress's life. In 1931 she made her first film outside Mingxing films. She appeared in Tianyi Film Company's film \\"Pleasures of the Dance Hall\\" which was very popular. The backstage plot featured sound from a disc and was a musical with drama interspersed with songs. Invasion On 18 September 1931 the Japanese engineered the Mukden Incident as a pretext to launch an invasion of Manchuria. The war stopped filming when they invaded Shanghai on January 28, 1932. Xuan formed the Xuan Jinglin Road Company and toured China giving musical performances.Xuan Jongli, Biography, Chinese Mirror, Retrieved 5 November 2016 Xuan died in Shanghai in 1992.

Vocation On 17 February 1969, she became along with Sr. Gertrude Lemmens and Sr. Margaret D‚ÄôCosta, one of the first to join the staff of Darul Sukun, home for around 150 mentally and physically disabled people, mostly children and teenagers, founded by the sisters of the Franciscan Missionaries of Christ the King. Since 2000, she has been in charge of the Darul Sukun. Sister Lewis was assisted by a team of five other nuns. Some of the residents like Cookie Lewis were so attached to the nun that she adopted her surname. She depended on many people and institutions who helped her run a home of this size. She praised the people who come and supply groceries, clothes or whatever the sisters need for the institution. Volunteers from schools and other organisations also help feed the children and play with them. She was also assisted by volunteers from the Netherlands who stay to help for as much as three months. Without financial assistance from the Government, she relied on donations to run the institution. She was particularly proud of four of the children who won medals in the Special Olympics held in the United States in 1998. Her role included welcoming visitors like American singer Mary McBride and Amanda Claudwell, the US press attach√© in Karachi, who visited on October 30, 2011. She has been listed among the people in Imran Aslam's book on the men and women who shaped Karachi. Making a wish In January 2015, Make-A-Wish Foundation Pakistan granted the wish of Cookie Lewis from Darul Sukun, to be a teacher for a day.

It has rough, fibrous grey bark, dull, narrow lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, creamy white flowers and cup-shaped to hemispherical or conical fruit.Eucalyptus distans flower buds Description Eucalyptus distans is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, fibrous, finely fissured grey bark with white patches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have narrow lance-shaped leaves long and wide. Adult leaves are the same dull, light green to grey-green colour on both sides, lance- shaped to curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on a thin, branched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel up to long. Mature buds are cylindrical to oval, long and about wide with a conical to rounded operculum. Flowering occurs between March and April and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped to hemispherical or conical capsule long and wide on a pedicel up to long. The valves extend well beyond the rim and the seeds are blackish brown. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus distans was first formally described in 1980 by Ian Brooker, Douglas Boland and David Kleinig from samples gathered near Katherine Gorge by Clyde Dunlop in 1977 and the description was published in Australalian Forest Research. Eucalyptus epruinata was described in 2000 by Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson in the journal Telopea from specimens collected in Queensland but the name is listed as a synonym by the Australian Plant Census. The specific epithet (distans) is a Latin word meaning \\"remote\\", \\"far apart\\" or \\"distant\\" indicating that this species is separated from the similar E. microtheca. Distribution and habitat Katherine box grows on low stony ridges. There are scattered populations through the Northern Territory between Katherine and Gove with disjunct populations near Fitzroy Crossing in Western Australia and near Croydon in Queensland. Conservation status Eucalyptus distans is classified as \\"Priority One\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk.

It is known as FM Cholollan. History XHSBE traces its origins to separate pirate radio stations in Tlaxcalancingo, located in the municipality of San Andr√©s Cholula, and Santa Mar√≠a Zacatepec, in Juan C. Bonilla Municipality. Pirate radio stations, however, are subject to seizure and forced closure. Axocotzin Radio, which had operated in Tlaxcalancingo since 2009 as an Internet radio station and on FM since 2011, was closed by representatives of the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT) on August 4, 2014. That same day, Radio Zacatepec in Santa Mar√≠a Zacatepec was shuttered. On May 30, 2015, Radio Zacatepec was forcibly closed for the second time in less than a year, having operated for just under two years. Recognizing the need to obtain a broadcast concession to make the station legal but also the limited availability of frequencies, the two former stations combined in order to pursue the goal of receiving full approval to serve the municipalities in the shadow of Popocat√©petl. Local residents demanded a new indigenous radio station be set up in the area, noting that stations from the Puebla metropolitan area do not pay attention to indigenous culture and issues. After initially being denied due to an alleged lack of spectrum, in July 2016, the IFT made history by awarding two social indigenous concessions, the first for broadcast use: one to the indigenous communities of San Bernardino Tlaxcalancingo and Santa Mar√≠a Zacatepec, and the other for XHJP-FM, a pre-existing station in Oaxaca. The new XHSBE-FM would broadcast on 107.1 MHz, being among the first stations designated in the new reserved band for social community and indigenous stations. XHSBE was initially approved to broadcast from a tower located on Cerro Tlacuaquilo in the community of San Francisco Coapa, located in San Andr√©s Cholula.XHSBE spectrum concession In 2019, it relocated to Cerro Zapotecas.

It was individually listed on the Davenport Register of Historic Properties and on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. In 2020 it was included as a contributing property in the Davenport Downtown Commercial Historic District. History The Scott Community College Urban Campus First Federal Savings and Loan Association was incorporated in December 1933, and it was one of the financial institutions in the city that survived the Great Depression. They began leasing the Lane Building in 1936 and purchased it three years later. Their operating budget grew from $5,487 in 1935 to $287,776 in 1941, and its assets from $14.8 million in 1947 to $53.5 million in 1959. They were primarily focused on financing new home construction and purchases, as well as capitalizing Davenport's growth in the mid-20th century. By 1966 when this building was completed, First Federal was the largest Savings and loan association in eastern Iowa and western Illinois. The three-story Modern movement building was designed by William F. Cann of the Bank Building and Equipment Corp. of St. Louis. It was built at the same location of their previous building. This was one of the first and most architecturally significant modern buildings in Davenport. First Federal opened their first branch location on the north side of town in 1968. The savings and loan reorganized as First Federal Savings Bank in 1993. It was folded into Mercantile Bank two years later. Mercantile moved their downtown headquarters in 1997, and this building was converted into an office building. It was vacated in 2015. The building has been connected to the neighboring First Midwest building to create a new urban campus for Scott Community College. Saratoga Capital Group of St. Louis designed the new campus. Renovation of the First Federal building was completed in time for classes to begin in January 2018. Architecture The exterior of the reinforced concrete structure is clad in white Vermont marble. It represents a move away from the transparent ‚Äúglass box‚Äù design and toward the use of mass, form and masonry cladding. A unique feature of the building was its original drive-thru window. The entrance was off Main Street on the west side of the building, and the customer would literally drive through the building and eventually exit onto West Third Street. The interior drive-thru was eliminated when the building was renovated in 1975, and a new drive-thru was built onto the east side. The mezzanine in the former financial services hall was eliminated in a 2002 building project when new office space was created. The conversion of the building into a college facility in 2018 left the exterior intact while reconfiguring the interior. Inspiration for the renovation project came from the Learning Commons at the University of Iowa.

He is best known for his service in the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914‚Äì1916, for which he was awarded the Silver Polar Medal. Biography Rickinson was born on 21 April 1883 in Lewisham, which was then part of the County of Kent but has since become part of Greater London. His father was Charles Napier Rickinson and his mother was Emma Isaac Rickinson. As a man trained for work with marine engines, he signed on the Endurance as the chief engineer. Although the Endurance was rigged as a barquentine, it also had a coal-burning engine and spent much of its time under steam. Under the expedition plans and the articles that Rickinson had signed, his job was to work the engines during the Antarctic summer of 1914-1915 to get the Endurance to the Filchner Ice Shelf. Once the vessel had reached her destination, she and her crew were supposed to unload the expedition leader, Sir Ernest Shackleton, and a shore party for expedition work in the interior of Antarctica. Rickinson and the ship's company were then supposed to steam north toward warmer waters to avoid the worst of the Antarctic winter of 1915. However, when the Endurance was beset by pack ice in the Weddell Sea, these plans could not be implemented. With all of the other members of the expedition, Rickinson was first forced to spend the winter in the depths of the southern Weddell Sea, and then shared the fate of his fellow explorers as castaways when the mother ship was crushed and sunk by the ice. After camping on the melting ice for some months, the ship's company and shore party were forced to take to lifeboats. Rickinson was assigned to the lifeboat Stancomb Wills. Shackleton was impressed by Rickinson's ability to take on his share of the survival duties of the party. Unfortunately in April 1916, when the lifeboat party was making a hazardous landing on the shore of Elephant Island off the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, young Rickinson was stricken while wading ashore in the surf. Once all were safely on shore, the expedition doctor diagnosed the 32-year-old engineer with a mild heart attack. He was advised to rest as much as possible in a crude lean-to hut, the Snuggery, built by the men. Meanwhile Shackleton and a picked crew of volunteers had separated from the main party to mount a forlorn open-boat attempt to escape from Antarctica and fetch help for the Elephant Island castaways, including Rickinson. After enduring more than four months of near-starvation rations Rickinson, who was still classified as an invalid, was rescued from Elephant Island with his comrades. His time in the Antarctic was over; it was 30 August 1916. Upon returning to Britain Rickinson found World War I being fought. Despite his cardiac diagnosis he joined the colours, was passed as fit, and served in the Royal Navy. In 1918 he married Marjorie Kate Snell. Two children, son Lewis F. Rickinson (1919) and daughter Betty Rickinson (1923), were born of this union. With the coming of peace Rickinson chose life on shore. He became a consulting engineer, specializing in the shipbuilding design and installation of marine power units. With the coming of World War II, Rickinson rejoined the colours and was assigned to HMS Pembroke, the pseudo-floating naval barracks and training establishment at Chatham in the Medway. He rose to the rank of engineer naval commander and served until his diagnosis with lung cancer. He was seconded to a Berkshire nursing home for hospice care, and died there in April 1945, age 61. Legacy In 1916‚Äì17, Rickinson was awarded the Polar Medal in silver.

YouTube personality Jenna Marbles served as an executive producer of the film. Plot Jeb rescues Max and the other children from the \\"school\\". His son Ari is left behind and presumed dead. In the present, Max is seen waking up from a dream; upon waking up, she encounters other members of the Flock. Iggy explains that they're running out of food, but Max wants to remain in the house. Angel is then captured by Erasers. The Flock returns to the house and find the schools location. They decide that Fang and Max will go to rescue Angel, while the others, will remain home. Ari went to the house looking for Max, but they fight him off and escape, but Ari is left alive. Max and Fang stop to eat on a rooftop in Utah, where Max hears a girl being attacked. Fang tells Max not to intervene, but Max flies down to help before being shot in the shoulder. Fang smashes the gunman through a window; the girl, Ella, tells him that her mother is a doctor. They rush Max to the veterinary practice where Max is operated on. Iggy, Gazzy and Nudge are walking through a small town. Iggy has a plan to meet up with the others at Lake Mead. Gazzy realizes Nudge is gone; they find her in a clothing store but have no idea that Ari is watching them. Max is given the all clear by the doctor, who points out a tracking chip in her shoulder and she rejoins Fang, who is angry that Max intervened but she insists it was the right thing to do. They arrive at the cabin. As they are about to kiss, they are interrupted by a sound outside and Fang covers Max's mouth. It turns out to be Izzy, Gazzy and Nudge. Max tells them about the tracking chip. They tell her about the house and about Ari. Max leaves the cabin and Ari confronts her and seems about to overpower her, but Fang starts fighting him before he and The Flock are captured. They recover at the School, in cages, but are initially overjoyed to find Angel. Ari arrives and escorts Max to where Jeb is waiting. Max no longer trusts Jeb who tells her that she was created to help people and save the world. He shows her a hidden note and tells her that it was Ari's choice to become an Eraser. Max leaves the room and distracts Ari enough to steal his key card. Meanwhile, one of the whitecoats is secretly reporting on Jeb to another authority. The woman says that the Flock is expendable, but dangerous, and must be controlled. Ari returns to the cage room to taunt Max, but Max has unlocked her cage and jumps on him. She hands the key card to Iggy before Ari chases her out of the room and the Flock escapes from their cages. Ari and the Erasers corner Max, only for the Flock to arrive with a bomb made by Gazzy. Max leaps out of the way and escapes safely. Jeb arrives, calling Ari's name. The Flock stands there, watching. Jeb pleads with Max, telling her she doesn't understand but she tells him the experiments over and opens her wings. Afterwards, the Flock walks through the woods. They pause and Max comforts Angel, only to collapse. She sees a vision of events throughout the movie, of child Ari moving to stab her with the scissors, and of New York City. When she awakens, she describes it to the Flock and they decide to go to New York City to look for more answers.

James Patterson would be the executive producer. Avi Arad, who had already worked on films such as Spider- Man and X-Men, would also produce alongside Steven Paul.Maximum Ride - The Film In an interview with James Patterson, it was revealed that Arad has already planned out the first two movies. On August 7, 2008, it was announced that Columbia Pictures had bought the screen rights to the franchise. The film was slated for a 2010 release. Catherine Hardwicke was said to direct and Don Payne would be handling the script. In January 2010 it was announced that the film would go into pre-production. Hardwicke asked for a script rewrite to include more action in the film and hired Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby for the job, which subsequently delayed its estimated release to 2013. In February 2011, the Maximum Ride Facebook page posted, \\"The Maximum Ride Movie is Coming ‚Äì In 3D!\\" and asked its Facebook fans who they would like to play Max in the movie. In an interview with USA Today, Patterson revealed that he was hopeful for a film adaptation. Patterson took note of fan-made audition videos from User Based Casting, a fan-driven casting initiative for the upcoming Maximum Ride film adaptation, commenting, \\"there's something like 9,000 Maximum Ride videos on YouTube, and some of them are stunning. I also think we're closer to the movie than we've been. I never know for sure in Hollywood, but it's definitely warm now.\\" The film ran into trouble in early 2012, when Catherine Hardwicke quit as the film director. When asked about the odds of a movie still being made, Patterson claimed he was \\"...very hopeful as opposed to mildly depressed\\".

Established in May 1869, it was published by the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Boston, Massachusetts. The monthly magazine describe conditions in the mission fields of the church, document the work of the society, and provide assistance to missionaries. The Heathen Woman's Friend was launched with volume 1, number 1 in May 1869. Its final issue, volume 27, number 6, was issued December 1895. The publication was relaunched as the Woman's Missionary Friend with volume 27, number 7 on January 1896, and ended with volume 73, number 7 in August 1940. The paper was able to pay its expenses and gave large sums to the Society. From 1882 to 1893, it contributed $26,000 to other forms of church work, and aided in carrying the miscellaneous literature published by the Society, the annual reports, uniform studies, maps of mission fields, life membership certificates for adults and for children, and a great variety of missionary leaflets. Organization At the very beginning of the Society, it was proposed that a monthly paper be issued, and the following prospectus was printed: \\"The\\" paper will be devoted more especially to the interests of the work among heathen women, and will be filled with interesting facts and incidents illustrating that work, furnished by those laboring in heathen lands. Information will be given concerning the customs and social life of the people, the various obstacles to be overcome in their Christianization, and the success which attends the various departments of missionary labor among them. The design is to furnish just such a paper as will be read with interest by all the friends of the cause, and one which will assist in enlisting the sympathies of the children also, and educate them more fully in the missionary work. The price of the paper .will be only thirty cents per annum, so that it will be within the reach of all.\\" The monthly magazine was launched to describe conditions in the mission fields of the church, document the work of the society, and provide assistance to missionaries. The paper was able to pay its expenses and gave large sums to the Society. From 1882 to 1893, it contributed $26,000 to other forms of church work, and aided in carrying the miscellaneous literature published by the Society, the annual reports, uniform studies, maps of mission fields, life membership certificates for adults and for children, and a great variety of missionary leaflets. Subscriptions ranged from 3,500 in 1869, to 21,000 in 1870, and 92,591 in 1929. Subscriptions could start in July, October, January, or April, though July and January were preferable. History Heathen Woman's Friend 1869-1895 1869 After the decision was reached to publish a paper, Harriet Merrick Warren was selected as editor. She was then only 25 years old. At that time, papers and magazines conducted by women were something of a novelty, the field new and untried. She immediately went to work, and the first issue of the paper, eight pages, appeared in May, 1869. Lewis Flanders stood ready with US$500 to meet deficiencies, if at the end of the year it was needed. Others also promised financial assistance. At the close of the first year, its subscription list had reached 4,000; it paid all running expenses, and had a margin on hand. It was then enlarged to 12 pages. James P. Magee acted as general agent. 1870s A 20,000 edition was required in 1870. The subscription price was raised from $0.30 to $0.35, and Lydia Hill Daggett was appointed agent. The July number in 1871 contained a map, giving all the missions of the Methodist Episcopal Church in India, in their relation to each other and to large cities. It was prepared by Isabella Thoburn, and was the first cartographic view of these missions ever printed for the Methodist Episcopal Church. In July, 1872, four more pages were added, and it became a 16-page paper. Its circulation reached 25,000. During the first seven years, a strong corps of contributing editors was annually elected. In May, 1872, the paper appeared with its first illustration. The engraving was that of the Mission House and Orphanage at Bareilly. Thereafter, this was a prominent feature. In 1875, the paper was increased to 24 pages, with a new heading, and the subscription price was raised to $0.50. In that year, a new feature was added, called the \\"Home Department,\\" the material being contributed by the Branch Secretaries. During the first five years of publication, the paper focused primarily on India and China. Volume VIII began with the addition of Mary Bannister Willard as editor of the Children's Department. She filled this position for two years, and was then reluctantly excused. During the 10 year, owing to financial depression, the subscription decreased to 13,388. Three years later, the number again reached 20,000. From 1878, it furnished the outline of what was entitled the \\"Uniform Study\\" of each month, by means of which the women of the Societies united in pursuing a systematic course of study of missionary subjects. 1880s In November, 1882, Daggett's resignation was accepted, and Pauline J. Walden, the publishing agent, was again appointed. The paper published full reports of the General Executive Committee in annual session, and the acknowledgment of all moneys to the Society through the Branch Treasurers, and kept the thread of the history of the work on every mission field abroad, as well as much of the detail of the work by the Auxiliaries at home. The German language edition, Heiden Frauen Freund, was established in 1885. Four more pages were added in 1886. The salary of the editor and the publisher was raised in 1888 from $500 to $700, and a sum sufficient to cover incidental expenses. 1890s The February number of 1893 contained an unwritten page with the name \\"Harriet Merrick Warren,\\" and underneath two dates, \\"September 15, 1843‚ÄîJanuary 7, 1893\\", announcing her death. For 24 years, she had been the newspaper's leader. She had developed the paper so that it soon took rank as one of the model missionary periodicals of the world, and had reached the largest number of subscribers of any woman's missionary magazine published at that time. After the death of Warren, her daughter, Mary Warren-Ayars, was appointed to take the mother's place, which she accepted. In July 1893, the form of the paper was changed, as had long been contemplated, to that of a magazine, and contained 30 pages. In the Young Woman's Department was included a column of bright notes about \\"Other Girls,\\" carrying out a desire expressed by Warren. For greater convenience, the table of contents and the columns containing information about Branch officers and the organization's other publications were brought together on the page next to the cover. Ayars carried on the work until the close of the year, declining a further appointment. At the General Executive Committee meeting in Saint Paul, Minnesota, in November, 1893, Louise Manning Hodgkins was unanimously elected to the position of editor. Rebranded in 1896 as Woman's Missionary Friend Hodgkins introduced some new features, a department of \\"Family News,\\" also a \\"Post-office Box,\\" and brought out some special numbers. The first was in March, 1894 ‚Äîthe 25th anniversary number‚Äî which was embellished with photo-engravings of the founders, Mrs. E. W. Parker (Lois Lee Parker and Mrs. Wm. Butler (Clementina Rowe Butler); and first missionaries, Isabella Thoburn and Dr. Clara Swain. The subscriptions in 1895 were nearly 22,000. But some considered the newspaper's name to be controversial and so a name change was discussed in St. Louis in 1896, with supporters claiming that it \\"expresses so much\\" while others argued that it was a \\"misnomer\\", even a \\"hinderance to their work\\". After discussion, it was renamed Woman‚Äôs Missionary Friend. Philip Butler, a Boston artist, would design the cover. 1900s By 1911, the publisher was Annie G. Bailey, with Elizabeth C. Northup as Editor; the subscription price was $0.50 per year. The editor of the German language version, Der Frauen-Missions-Freund was Amalie M. Achard, of Elgin, Illinois; subscription price was $0.26 per year. The publication merged into Methodist Woman in 1940.

After graduating with undergraduate and master's degrees in geology from the University of British Columbia and a doctorate from Princeton University, Roots joined the Scott Polar Research Institute and was appointed Chief Geologist for the 1949 to 1952 Norwegian‚ÄìBritish‚ÄìSwedish Antarctic Expedition. During the expedition, in addition to ground-breaking geological and glaciological research studies, he made a 189-day, unsupported dog sled journey across the continent; a record that still stood at the time of his death over six decades later. On his return to Canada he joined the Geological Survey of Canada with whom he served as a field geologist until 1958, when he left to help found the Polar Continental Shelf Program. After 14 years with PCSP, Roots left to act as science advisor to the newly created federal Department of the Environment, where he remained on staff until 1989. After retirement, Roots remained an active participant in polar research, and also became a key mentor within the Students on Ice educational program. He continued to participate in expeditions for Students on Ice well into his tenth decade, his last being to Greenland only two months before his death. Early life Fred Roots was born in Salmon Arm, in the Shuswap Country of southern British Columbia, Canada, on 5 July 1923. He was the second child of Margaret and Ernest Roots. His father was an engineer with the Canadian Pacific Railway, and while Fred was a small child the family moved to Banff, Alberta, when Ernest was appointed Chief Engineer at the company's Banff Springs Hotel. As a result, Roots spent much of his childhood surrounded by the high ranges of the Canadian Rockies. Growing up among the mountains instilled in Roots a lasting love of outdoor exploration and geology. However, when Roots was only eight years old his father died from typhoid fever, leaving his mother to bring up the family's three children on her own. As a young high school student Roots was appointed as an assistant meteorological observer for the Banff National Park. His duties involved climbing to the summit of a mountain within the park, to service the weather observation station located there. Later in his high school career he moved west to Vancouver, and completed his schooling at Vancouver Technical College. During the Second World War he was a student the University of British Columbia, from where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in geological engineering. He remained at the same institution to continue his postgraduate education, and completed a master's degree thesis on the geology of the Aiken Lake map-area, in the Cassiar Mountains of northern British Columbia, in 1947. It was during this work that he first became involved with the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC), as he worked alongside the survey's staff geologist J.E. Armstrong to map the mineral-rich district. The same district provided the subject matter for his doctoral research which followed at Princeton University, from where he graduated with a Ph.D. degree in 1950. Polar and Himalayan exploration In 1949, at the age of 26, Roots was appointed Chief Geologist for the Norwegian‚ÄìBritish‚ÄìSwedish Antarctic Expedition, the first exploratory expedition to Antarctica to involve an international team of scientists. Roots's role was to study the geology of Queen Maud Land, which he showed was a conjugate part of and had once been attached to the east coast of southern Africa. In addition to his geological observations, Roots also helped to show that the glaciers of Antarctica had once been much more extensive, and that the phenomenon of climate change was a global effect and not limited to discrete locations. During the course of the expedition, Roots undertook a 189-day, unsupported dog sled journey across the continent. This feat of endurance remained a record even at the time of his death, over six decades later. For the rest of his life, Roots regularly wore a belt made from leather taken from the traces of his lead dog of that expedition, Rachel. Public service Following his return from the southern hemisphere in 1952, Roots completed the remainder of his fellowship at the Scott Polar Research Institute at Cambridge University. It was during this time that he met and fell in love with one of the Institute's librarians, June Blomfield, herself a highly educated geographer and passionate outdoorswoman. Geological Survey of Canada At the end of his fellowship in Cambridge, Roots was appointed as a field geologist with the GSC, based at the survey's head office in Ottawa, Ontario. His first major publication for the survey in 1953 was essentially a reworking of his extensive research in the Cassiar Mountains, conducted during his MSc and PhD studies, but he rapidly became a part of the GSC's active field research programs at the time. Fred and June eventually married in 1955, and June moved out to Canada to be with her new husband. Under Y.O. Fortier, he was co-leader of the GSC's Operation Franklin in 1955, that first established the potential for economic petroleum deposits in the high Arctic islands of Canada. Between 1956 and 1958 Roots was, in turn, head of Operation Stikine, the GSC's first systematic attempt to map the geology of the northern portion of the Canadian Cordillera of British Columbia and Yukon. Polar Continental Shelf Program In 1958, Roots left the GSC to become the founding head of the Government of Canada's new Polar Continental Shelf Program (PCSP). PCSP was set up to promote research in Canada's Arctic north, principally by providing logistical and practical support for government and academic scientists active in the area, and Roots had largely been responsible for conceiving of and establishing the novel organization. During his time with PCSP, Roots was a key part of the team that outlined the need for a permanent establishment to conduct research on the icefields of the Kluane National Park of southwest Yukon, part of the largest non-polar icefield in the world. In the years that followed, the Kluane Lake Research Station also became a hub for exploration across Canada's north, and Roots himself used it as a base from which to organize expeditions through the Saint Elias Mountains, Canada's highest mountain range, as part of the Canadian Centennial celebrations in 1967. Roots served as head of PCSP for 14 years, until 1971, when he left to join what was to eventually become Environment Canada. Department of the Environment At the time, the newly established government department was in a state of flux. As science advisor to the Minister of the Environment, Roots was instrumental in helping design the department's structure and objectives, and has been credited with giving it \\"the scientific credibility, the moral authority and knowledge that enabled it to play its role.\\" He remained with Environment Canada until his retirement from public service in 1989, and subsequently retained a role with the department as an emeritus scientist and advisor until 2003. Life after retirement Following his retirement, Roots and his wife moved back to British Columbia from their home in Gatineau, Quebec. In the mid-1990s, at a meeting of the Canadian Polar Commission in Ottawa, Roots met explorer and educator Geoff Green. At the time, Green was attempting to launch a new educational initiative aimed at providing opportunities for secondary school students to visit and explore polar regions. The scheme, Students on Ice, struck a chord with Roots and he agreed to support its formation. Green has credited Roots with being one of the program's \\"founding fathers\\". Over the following two decades, Roots participated in many polar expeditions for Students on Ice, and acted as a mentor to hundreds of students from around the world. Roots's final Arctic exploration was as part of a Students on Ice expedition to Greenland in August 2016. Later the same month he travelled to New York to receive the Explorers Club Medal from The Explorers Club. Previous recipients of the award include explorers Sir Edmund Hillary and Roald Amundsen, primatologist Jane Goodall, and astronaut Neil Armstrong. E.F. \\"Fred\\" Roots died peacefully in his sleep at home in East Sooke on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, on 18 October 2016. He was 93 years old. He was survived by June and four of their five children. He was predeceased earlier the same year by his son, Charlie Roots, who had himself been a geologist and explorer with the Geological Survey of Canada. Awards and recognition During the course of his research career, after retirement, and in recognition of his exploration in both the northern and southern polar regions, various academic societies and associations conferred distinctions upon Roots: *Ness Award of the Royal Geographical Society (1955) *Fellow of the Arctic Institute of North America (1955) *Polar Medal awarded by the Sovereign of the United Kingdom (1956) *Gold Medal of the Royal Geographical Society (1965) *Massey Medal of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society (1979) *Officer of the Order of Canada (1987) *Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada (1990) *Explorers Club Medal of The Explorers Club (2016) Namesake locations In recognition of his exemplary service in the exploration and scientific investigation of the Antarctic continent, a number of places and geographic features on the landmass have been named in honour of Roots. Roots Heights (Norwegian: '; ), named in 1966, is an area of high ground at the top of an ice-free, flat- topped mountain, approximately central within the Sverdrup Mountains of Queen Maud Land. On the western side of Roots Heights is a large glacial cirque, named Fred Cirque (Norwegian: '; ) also in 1966. Both features were mapped by Norwegian cartographers during the course of the Norwegian‚ÄìBritish‚ÄìSwedish Antarctic Expedition for which Roots was Chief Geologist. Multiple biographical articles and obituaries claim that an entire range of mountains on Antarctica is named for Roots, but there appears to be no evidence for this in gazetteers and geographic name directories. Namesake fossil During his master's thesis research in the Aiken Lake area of northern British Columbia, Roots collected samples of fossils to assist in correlation and dating of the various rock units that he examined there. One of these samples contained a sponge reef fauna which included a species of Archaeocyatha that had not yet been formally described. Fortunately for Roots, on the faculty of the Department of Geology at the University of British Columbia was Vladimir Okulitch, a paleontologist who specialized in Archaeocytha fossils. Okulitch named the species Protopharetra rootsi, meaning 'Roots's first quiver', recognizing both the finder of the fossil as well as its shape.

She was also an untiring worker in the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society, its first recording secretary, and for years, president of the New England Branch. Warren is remembered as a \\"major leader of 'Woman's Work for Woman'\\" movement. Early life and education Harriet Cornelia Merrick was born at Wilbraham, Massachusetts, September 15, 1843. Her parents were John M. and Mary J. Merrick. John was a leading citizen of Wilbraham and of Hampden County, occupying many important public positions, both civil and ecclesiastical. He was a trustee of Wesleyan Academy, and a member of the board. She was educated at Wilbraham Academy, of which her father was a trustee; and the Academy of which Dr. Miner Raymond served as principal. Career On April 14, 1861, she married Rev. William Fairfield Warren, who became the first president of Boston University. At the time of marriage, he was professor of the Missions-Anstalt at Bremen, Germany, under the direction of the Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. She traveled with her husband in England, France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece. While there, she pursued advanced studies in history, literature, languages, art and music, and became adept in French, German, and Italian. She returned to the US after five years and pursued religious and benevolent ways to occupy her time. From the first, she was in the Woman's Foreign Missionary movement. She was the editor of The Heathen Woman's Friend from its beginning, and made it one of the best missionary periodicals published. Two years, she additionally edited the German organ, the Heiden Frauen Frdund. Heathen Woman's Friend The first number of the society's first periodical, the Heathen Woman's Friend, appeared in June, 1869. Warren was its editor for 24 years, beginning at the time when women editors were so rare as to make the position one of isolation. Financially, it was questionable, there being no money behind the paper and no influence, except that a handful of women were devoted to sending to foreign fields their first missionaries. But the result proved to be a financial success, for in 30 years it not only paid its own expenses, but contributed over for the publication and scattering of leaflets and other missionary literature. Warren penned her last editorial, \\"The Bugle-call,\\" on Thursday, January 5, 1893, two days before she died. Affiliations Warren was president of the New England Branch of the Methodist Episcopal Church, a member and frequently chairman of the General Executive Committee, and a member of various other committees. She was also active in the management of the Massachusetts Society for the University Education of Women; a trustee of the New England Conservatory of Music; an officer in the Cambridge Indian Rights Association; a committee worker for the Cambridge Hospital; and a member and officer of the American Maternal Association. Death She died at Cambridge, Massachusetts, January 7, 1893.

It was released online by BBC Three on 19 November 2016. The episode was written by the series' creator Patrick Ness and directed by Wayne Che Yip. Class follows four students of Coal Hill Academy and their alien teacher, as they deal with various alien threats. In the episode, which was described as an example of bottle episode, Miss Quill (Katherine Kelly) leaves the other characters in detention while she attends urgent matters. Things take an unexpected turn when a meteor flies through a tear in space and time right into the detention room, sending it and its occupants outside of time and space. To find a way out before it is too late, the students must interact with the meteor; however doing so also forces them to admit secret truths to their classmates, which is not without consequences. The following episode, \\"The Metaphysical Engine, or What Quill Did\\", takes place concurrently with \\"Detained\\" and follows Miss Quill instead of the students. The episode was acclaimed by critics for its writing, directing, and performances; several critics called it the best episode of the series.  Plot  The episode opens with Miss Quill, accompanying Charlie to detention for being a few minutes late to a class earlier that day. As he protests, Quill reminds him that although he forced her into slavery and refuses to avenge the genocides of their species using the Cabinet of Souls, she as a teacher has the authority to put him in detention. When they arrive, Charlie realizes that all the other students tasked by the Doctor to protect the school were also placed in detention by Quill; before he can react, Quill locks the door, hinting that she has other matters to attend and want to keep them out of her way. As Charlie starts getting panicked due to his claustrophobia, April, who has another key, opens the door for him; as she does, a meteor flies through a nearby tear in space and time right into the detention room, causing a small explosion. The students are unharmed, but realize that now, the room simply seems to be floating in black nothingness. The students start by wondering what happened to them. After ruling out that it was a part of Miss Quill's plan and deciding that they are not in space, they come to the conclusion that something came out of a crack in space and time. They quickly find the meteor and understand that it is responsible for their situation. Things start to get out of control as they fear that the meteor might causes radiation, and Matteusz, deciding to act, grabs the meteor to throw it by the door. However, before he can do it, he is hit by the strange effects of the stone: without any apparent reason, he starts telling events of back when he lived in Poland and came out to his grandmother, before suddenly telling his boyfriend Charlie that he despite loving him, he is also afraid of him because Charlie is not human. He refuses to let go of the stone, until April knocks it away from him. Being back to normal, Matteusz explains that he does not know why he said those things, but that they were all true. He insists that it was only a part of the truth, but Charlie is hurt nonetheless. While they continue to try finding out a solution, everyone keeps being strangely angry, even as they realize it and find no apparent reason. This leads Tanya to the conclusion that the stone is of alien origin, forces whoever holds it to tell the truth, and is also making them progressively angrier. Finally, she makes the assumption that the stone may somehow communicate via the person holding it, and grabs it herself. Like Matteusz, she tells her story about her past life relating to her having to admit the truth. Then, forced to honesty by the stone, she states than none of the other students are actually her friends, and that they all look down on her because she is younger. However, having concluded that as she cannot tell lies, she might answer to questions regarding the meteor, she makes the others question her about their situation: the trick works, and she reveals that the stone \\"fries your brain\\" if one holds it too long, and that it is sentient, wants to use them, and is \\"a prisoner\\". Ram then knocks the stone away from her before it is too late. Charlie tries to see if they can escape through the nothingness, but finds out that it is a mirror portal that immediately brings anything back inside. Having concluded that they now share the meteor's prison, the students decide that they must use the stone again to find how to get out. However, they also conclude that only those who did not use the stone yet can do it, as the ones who already did might die should they try again. Ram volunteers and grabs the meteor: he is forced to confess to April that he is in love with her, but is able to reveal that the prisoner is a male and a murderer who took many lives, but also that as a part of his punishment, he is forced to always say the truth, explaining the stone's effects on them. Ram also felt like the prisoner was somehow gaining strength from their confessions and wants to kill them. The students are fighting more and more, due to the influence of the stone but also to all they truly feel after the last revelations. Forced to act faster as Charlie starts having panic attacks due to his claustrophobia, April grabs the meteor, who has gotten more powerful: she is able to reveal that they were taken out of space and time, meaning they will not age or die, but will stay trapped here forever. However, for those reveals she also had to admit to Ram that she does not love him. Without having to hold the stone, Charlie reveals his feelings to the others. He tells them that he deeply desires to murder the entire Shadow Kin using the Cabinet of Souls, in revenge for them slaughtering his entire race, even if it means losing everything he cares for. He also admits that sometimes he hates Matteusz for being the main reason why he doesn't do it, and that none of the other students really know him. He finally grabs the meteor, thinking he has nothing left to confess, before realizing and admitting that he knows he will eventually lose Matteusz. As Charlie had confessed every secret he had and proved he was more guilty in his heart that the prisoner himself, the stone breaks and the classroom and students are teleported back into their normal place in space and time. However, the prison meteor, recognizing Charlie as a guilty criminal (because that is what he feels in his heart), attempts to trap him inside of the stone forever alongside the prisoner; he is saved by a returning Miss Quill, who shoots the meteor and destroys it. As the other students leave the classroom deeply angry at each other after all those revelations, Charlie, asks a transformed Quill, now with a scar on her left eye and inexplicably longer hair than 45 minutes ago, how she is now able to use a gun. She reveals that the creature he put in her mind to enslave her and stop her from running wild has been removed, and that she now has her freedom of action back; she states that things are going to change. Outside references * Trying to justify his words to Charlie, Matteusz mentions The Chronicles of Narnia and something similar that happens to the character of Susan. Charlie, unaware that it is a work of fiction, asks if Narnia is in Canada.  Production  The episode was directed by Wayne Che Yip, who also directed the following episode, \\"The Metaphysical Engine, or What Quill Did\\". It was premiered on 19 November 2016 at 10am. The episode was broadcast in the United States in early 2017 on BBC America. \\"Detained\\" features several close-up shots (here, Jordan Renzo as Matteusz) with highlights of light across the characters' eyes; several critics saw it as a homage to Star Trek, another science fiction series with notable bottle episodes.  Reception  The episode was acclaimed by critics, and was called the best in the series by some. The conflicts between the characters and reveals of their true feelings were praised, together with the episode's writing, directing, and performances, notably Greg Austin and Jordan Renzo as Charlie and Matteusz respectively. Alex Moreland of Flickering Myth widely acclaimed the episode, giving it a perfect rating of 10, highly praising its writing, performances, and directing, and considering it the best episode of the season. He called it \\"the best episode of Class yet ‚Äì possibly the closest it‚Äôs come to a genuinely resounding classic that could stand alongside the best of Doctor Who\\". He also stated \\"The central conceit of the episode is able to transcend its apparent artifice, instead providing the impetus for some powerful character drama. It‚Äôs often moving, consistently nuanced, and regularly insightful; Ness has a real ability to get to the heart of his characters, and ‚ÄòDetained‚Äô is the best example of this. There‚Äôs a real energy to this episode ‚Äì it‚Äôs a tense, moody piece of drama, quite unlike anything the show has given us so far. And yet, in many ways, one can‚Äôt help but feel that Class would have been significantly diminished, to the point of being incomplete, without this episode\\". Dave Golder of Mym Buzz gave the episode four out of five stars, calling it \\"as pure an example of a bottle episode as you could imagine. No guest stars. One set (two if you include the corridor outside the classroom). And lots and lots and lots of jaw jaw about ‚Äìugh ‚Äì emotions. And it‚Äôs also brilliant\\". He also praised the \\"clever scripting\\" and \\"very stylish direction\\" for making the episode visually appealing, and the performances (Greg Austin's in particular), and stated \\"There‚Äôs great acting throughout and some marvellously awkward moments as the 'truths' are revealed. A couple of the speeches (Tanya‚Äôs 'typical white people' strop especially) come across a little clunky but the sentiments behind them feel genuine. And that feeling of 'not connecting' is a theme that‚Äôll ring true to anyone who‚Äôs even been a teenager that‚Äôs ripped right open and left raw and bleeding here.\\" Vodzilla gave the episode a 9 out of 10, highly praising its inventivity and performances, and stating \\"'Detained' is Class at its best, plunging the group into a situation where the intensity of their relationships with one another works hand-in-hand with the relatively short time they‚Äôve known each other to wreak emotional havoc. The students all know themselves and each other far better at the end of the episode than they did at the start and, unlike a grateful audience, they might not be glad of what they find out\\". Cult Box gave the episode a perfect rating of five, stating \\"Director Wayne Yip (Utopia, Misfits) effectively sold their confinement, the escalating levels of mistrust and the sense that they were not alone with some terrific close-up camera work, and a filtered pov during the moments of possession\\". Den of Geek highly praised the episode for its character development, performances, stating \\"Class cares. It doesn‚Äôt patronise or mock its characters for what they‚Äôre going through. It cares about them, and it shows them caring about each other. We can‚Äôt overstate the good that does\\". Fortress of Solitude highly praised the cast, stating that \\"the performers handles their role superbly, with each of them having a moment to shine\\", and the conflicts between the characters. Several critics favourably compared \\"Detained\\" to the Doctor Who episode \\"Midnight\\", which also featured a group of characters trapped in a single room.

The soldiers of this division fought until early 1944 to break the siege and drive off the besieging German forces, distinguishing themselves in the liberation of Novgorod. Finally, the division was redeployed to advance into the Baltic states in 1944 and into East Prussia in the winter of 1945. As the war was ending the 378th was disbanded to provide replacements for other divisions. Nevertheless, it had compiled a very creditable combat record for any rifle division.  Formation  The 378th began forming on August 10, 1941 at Achinsk in the Siberian Military District, based on an RKO order of that date that included the 372nd, 374th and 376th Rifle Divisions. It was destined for the 59th Army in Volkhov Front.Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 79 Its order of battle was as follows: * 1254th Rifle Regiment * 1256th Rifle Regiment * 1258th Rifle Regiment * 944th Artillery RegimentCharles C.

Ivan Petrovich Dorofeev, was appointed on November 1. The division was given about six weeks to form up before it was sent by rail to the front, arriving at Vologda, east of Leningrad, and was assigned to 59th Army by November 15.  Battle of Leningrad  When the 378th arrived at the front it was hampered from the lack of heavy weapons available to outfit reserve units at this time. At this point, the artillery regiment had only two battalions, instead of three. The 1st battalion had nine 76mm guns in three undersized batteries of three guns each, while the 2nd had just four 122mm howitzers and another four 76mm guns. This was less than half the authorized strength. The regimental mortar units were formed with improvised equipment as well, because in 1942, when the division consolidated these weapons into a divisional battalion, it had one battery of 107mm mountain mortars and one of 120mm mortars, indicating that the division had mountain equipment substituted for at least half the regimental pieces authorized. It also did not receive its antitank battalion until early 1942.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 102 59th Army entered the Lyuban Offensive Operation on January 6, 1942, but the division was in the second echelon in the early stages. These attacks made little progress and collapsed in utter exhaustion and confusion a few days later. Nonplussed by the failures, Stalin dispatched his deputy, Lev Mekhlis, to supervise the Front's preparations to renew the offensive. While Mekhlis' presence was more often a hindrance to Soviet operations, in this case he made at least one positive contribution: In this way, some of the 378th's deficiencies were made up. After regrouping the offensive was renewed on January 13, again without much success. In preparation for a further effort to begin on January 27, the division was regrouped to the Dubtsy Station and Sleshchenshoe village sector. While the renewed attack did not achieve all its objectives, over 100,000 men of 2nd Shock Army were able to advance as far as 75 km into the German rear.David M. Glantz, The Battle for Leningrad 1941 - 1944, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2002, pp. 158-61, 164, 167. The quotation is from S. Ruban, \\"Tragediia podviga: Lyuban, god 1942-1\\", Voennye znaniia, February, 1993 Within weeks the German I Corps had turned the tables, and 2nd Shock found itself partially encircled, with just a narrow corridor under enemy fire linking back to Volkhov Front. The 378th, still outside the pocket in 59th Army, was referenced in orders from Leningrad Front on May 2 to be deployed in the Liubino Pole area in Front reserve and to receive replacements. During subsequent operations to widen the corridor the division fought its way into the pocket, only to be cut off itself; it was able to extricate itself on May 16.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 194-95, 202 Just prior to Operation Pole Star, the 378th was moved to 54th Army, still in Volkhov Front. That army went into the attack on February 10, 1943, in the sector north of Smerdynia and the Tygoda River, aiming at the rail line south of Tosno. The division was one of four launched against the defenses of 96th Infantry Division, backed by three rifle brigades and the 124th Tank Brigade. Despite its superior forces the shock group penetrated only 3 ‚Äì 4 km along a 5 km front in three days of fighting. The Germans halted the assault by reinforcing its defense with regimental groups from other sectors.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 295-96 Following this effort, the 378th was shifted to 8th Army in March, to take part in a pincer attack on Mga with 55th Army which began on March 19. After a 135-minute artillery preparation and three days of intense fighting, 8th Army's first echelon divisions, including the 378th, had penetrated 3 - 4 km on a 7 km front, at the junction of the 1st and 223rd Infantry Divisions. At this point a mobile group consisting of the 191st Guards Rifle Regiment from 64th Guards Rifle Division and a battalion of tanks was committed to advance to Mga Station. In ongoing fighting until April 2 this last objective was not reached.Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2009, pp. 458-59 Despite this, on April 28 the 378th was singled out for its performance and awarded the Order of the Red Banner. A further effort began on July 22; in this attack the division was paired with 18th Rifle Division as the first echelon of a shock group deployed north of the Mga-Volkhov rail line, facing the bulk of the German 5th Mountain Division. For six days prior to the assault, 8th Army artillery had pounded the German defenses, and the attackers soon took the forward trenches, but stiff resistance and heavy airstrikes held up further progress. 5th Mountain, however, took extremely heavy losses, and in late July had to be reinforced by 132nd Infantry Division to avert disaster. On August 9 the Soviet forward troops believed they had found a weak place in the German line, defended by the battered mountain troops. On August 11, two rifle divisions and two tank regiments moved to support the 378th and two other divisions already fighting on this sector. While this effort finally took the strongpoint at Porechye, which was evacuated by the Germans on the night of August 14-15, the overall offensive collapsed in utter exhaustion. During the Sixth Sinyavino Offensive in September, the division made a further effort against 5th Mountain but made little progress. The front around Leningrad fell relatively quiet for the next few months.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 301-02, 309, 311-13, 317 Novgorod Offensive Later in September, the 378th was assigned to the 14th Rifle Corps, where it would remain for the remainder of its service.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 102 At the same time, it was moved back to 59th Army. 59th Army's offensive on Novgorod began on January 14, 1944, with 14th Corps closest to the objective. Despite a heavy artillery preparation, the assault by 6th Rifle Corps, north of 14th Corps, stalled after advancing only 1 kilometre. Fortunately for 6th Corps, the 1258th Rifle Regiment of the 378th attacked prematurely and without orders, taking advantage of the fact that German troops had abandoned their forward works during the artillery preparation, and seized a portion of those defenses. The 1254th Rifle Regiment then joined the attack and the two regiments overcame the first two German trench lines and gained a small bridgehead over the Pitba River at Malovodskoe. By late on January 16, 59th Army had torn a 20km wide hole in the Germans' main defensive belt. The following day, despite bad weather, difficult terrain and lack of transport, 59th Army was clearly threatening to encircle the German XXXVIII Army Corps at Novgorod. On the night of January 19 these forces got the order to break out along the last remaining route. The city was liberated on the morning of the 20th, and on the next day most of the survivors of the German corps were surrounded and soon destroyed.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 346-49 In recognition of this feat, the 378th Rifle Division was recognized as follows: As the offensive continued, Volkhov Front was dissolved on February 13, and the division was reassigned to Leningrad Front. It was then near Narva, back in 8th Army, then returned to 59th Army until April, when it was moved to 42nd Army in 3rd Baltic Front. In June, 14th Rifle Corps went into the reserves of 1st Baltic Front, then into 4th Shock Army in 2nd Baltic Front. In the second week of July it was in the vicinity of Sharkovshchina, advancing into the so- called \\"Baltic Gap\\".The Gamers, Inc., Baltic Gap, Multi-Man Publishing, Inc., Millersville, MD, 2009, p. 14 By August it was back in 1st Baltic Front in the same army, and remained under those commands until February, 1945, when the division was briefly assigned to 6th Guards Army.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 102 On October 22, 1944, the 1254th and 1258th Rifle Regiments, plus the 944th Artillery Regiment, were awarded the Order of Aleksandr Nevsky for their roles in the liberation of Riga. Disbandment Later in February, 14th Rifle Corps went into 2nd Baltic Front reserves, and then to the strategic rear, where the corps was subordinated to the Lithuanian Military District as a garrison. While in garrison, the 378th was officially disbanded on March 13 (Feskov states March 1), in order to rebuild other divisions in the corps, in particular the 90th Guards Rifle Division, which inherited the 378th's Order of the Red Banner and Novgorod honorific.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 102 References=CitationsBibliography  p. 156 * pp. 284‚Äì85 External links *Georgii Pavlovich Lilenkov *Ivan Mikhailovich Platov *Aleksandr Romanovich Belov 378 Category:Military units and formations established in 1941 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1945 Category:Military units and formations awarded the Order of the Red Banner ","title":"378th Rifle Division"},{"id":"52194256","text":"Ain Padrik (born April 27, 1947) is an Estonian architect. Padrik graduated from Estonian Academy of Arts as an architect in 1971. He belonged to the group of young architects and artists called the Tallinn School, which was grouped from Tiit Kaljundi, Vilen K√ºnnapu, Leonhard Lapin, Avo-Himm Looveer and √úlevi Eljand. During the Soviet period he worked at EKE Projekt. In 1991 Padrik and Vilen K√ºnnapu formed the company K√ºnnapu & Padrik. Padrik has been a teacher at Tallinn University of Technology. He is part of the Union of Estonian Architects. Creation One of his works is the Raikk√ºla Kolkhoz building (1981). The postmodernist building is masterfully bounded with a mansion ensemble close by. Throughout the building there are details of classical architecture - pillars, pilasters and frontons. At the same time the building follows the sample house architecture. In the same year, Padrik and K√ºnnapu took part in the Tallinn 2. Secondary School competition. A postmodern building with the masculine Atlantis holding the rooftop angle, brought them a first place. In the 1990s, however, it was found that the building was using too much resources and the idea of a glass elevator on the facade did not find support from the heritage protection, due which the building was not built. Similar fate was with the Lembitu house of fashion architecture competition in Tallinn, 1979 that was also unbuilt. In 1982 they looked outside of Estonia and took part of their first international competition Parc de la Villette Competition in Paris. The first international recognition came to Padrik and K√ºnnapu in collaboration with Lennart Meri with the Architectural Competition of the Arctic Center in 1984 in Finland, winning them the special prize.Arctic Center Rovaniemi konkursit√∂√∂ \\"Silverwhite\\". (EAM Fk 9706); Eesti Arhitektuurimuuseum The main volume of the building was penetrated by the slanting glass tower directed towards the Stella Polaris. The mythological concept with Lappish ornamentation was formed into a contemporary and simple image. The building received a lot of foreign attention. It was published in the Finnish Architectural Journal \\"Architehti\\" and in the British \\"Architectural Review\\", and eventually reached the New York's prestigious \\"Modern Redux\\" exhibition. K√ºnnapu and Padrik together with Andres Siim took part of the second international competition in 1988 at the West Coast Gateway in Los Angeles and won second place.West Coast Gateway Los Angeleses, EAM _ 10131 Ar 41.1.22, Eesti Arhitektuurimuuseum, http://www.muis.ee/museaalview/2244735 The original task was to create a large cultural centre above an 8-lane freeway in Los Angeles. The conceptual idea was based on simple scheme - two long beams placed above freeway. The abyss between the beams was filled with various communications and geometric forms in which the functions of the building were located. After establishing the company K√ºnnapu & Padrik in 1994, the Methodist Church in Tallinn was designed (built in 2000). The multifunctional church represented a sign of changes in the social attitude. The previous business buildings which were oriented to capitalism was now changing towards civil society. The focus of a sculptural and ship-like building is centered around the entrance with the tower reaching into heights. During the 1990s they created more pragmatic but spiritually charged projects from office buildings to private houses. Among their work stand out the Hotel Radisson SAS (1999) and Viru Centre (2004) in Tallinn, Tigutorn (2008) and AHHAA Science Center (2012)in Tartu. Tigutorn, built in 2008, is a clear example of the architects style. Shell shaped building is fragmented with the rhythm of windows.

It is the UNESCO-International Theater Institute Center in the Philippines. It is a non-profit, non-stock, non- governmental, and a registered donee institution. It was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2017. History On April 7, 1967, Cecile Guidote-Alvarez established the Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA) who meant the organization to be a vehicle for Philippine Theater to play a role in the development of the country's people and society. Four years later in 1971, PETA was named the UNESCO-International Theater Institute Center in the Philippines. In the same year, coinciding with the 400th foundation anniversary of Manila, PETA organized the first Third World Theater Festival. Martial law in the Philippines forced founder Guidote-Alvarez to go to a political exile in 1972 but the theatrical organization remains operational. The theatrical works of the organization revolved around the social conditions and political climate during the Martial law era and focused on using the medium of theater as an empowerment for the marginalized sectors. By this period, PETA began creating and performing theatrical plays in Filipino. Among the venues for its first productions was Paco Park,Marasigan, Dennis. \\"PETA and REP turn 5O: Why it's also a golden moment for Philippine Theater. https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/258785/peta-rep-turn-50-also-golden-moment-ph- theater/ Retrieved December 18, 2018 until it gained access to a portion of Fort Santiago which it transformed into the Raja Sulayman Theater. This open- air theater was designed by Leandro V. Locsin, a National Artist. About 300 plays were adapted, translated, written, published, and performed by the organization by the 1990s. From the beginning, Peta‚Äôs pro-people bias was well-known. That philosophy dictated its choice of materials to produce, as well as its chosen language for performance‚ÄîFilipino and other Philippine languages. It encouraged the writing of original works as well as translation of world classics, especially those that reflected and resonated with the social climate of the times.

Biography Graves was born in 1856 in Willington, South Carolina to General James Porterfield Graves (1820‚Äì1914) and Katherine Floride Townes (1827‚Äì1858). He was related to the Calhoun family, a prominent family in 18th and 19th-century American politics, and was the great-grandnephew of John C. Calhoun, who served as Vice President of the United States from 1825 until 1832. He served as a presidential elector for Florida in 1884 and for Georgia in 1888. He was an Atlantan. In 1903, Graves made a statement defending lynching: \\"The problem of the hour is not how to prevent lynching in the South, but the larger question: How shall we destroy the crime which always has and always will provoke lynching? The answer which the mob returns to this vital question is already known. The mob answers it with the rope, the bullet, and sometimes, God save us! with the torch. And the mob is practical; its theory is effective to a large degree. The mob is today the sternest, the strongest, and the most effective restraint that the age holds for the control of rape.\\" 1908 vice presidential candidacy The newly formed Independence Party decided to hold a national convention in Chicago, Illinois. Graves was nominated as one of the candidates for president on July 27. The first ballot saw a tally of 396 votes for Thomas L. Hisgen, 213 for Graves, 200 for Milford W. Howard, 71 for Reuben R. Lyon, and 49 for William Randolph Hearst. A second ballot brought Hisgen to the doorstep of nomination, gathering 590 votes, compared to 189 for Graves and 109 for Howard. Only in the early morning hours of Wednesday, July 29 did Hisgen go over the top, winning the nomination. Graves was subsequently chosen as the party's nominee for vice president.\\"Hisgen and Graves New Party Ticket: The Independence Convention Makes Its Choice in Early Morning,\\" New York Times, July 29, 1908, pp. 1, 3. In the general election, the Independence Party ticket received 82,574 votes (0.55%), coming in fifth place. They performed best in Massachusetts, where they received 4.2% of the popular vote. Following the general election defeat, the Independence Party quickly faded away into obscurity, although they were fielding candidates in New York until 1914. Later career Graves later rejoined the Democratic Party and spoke at the 1912 Democratic National Convention. Graves was the first to suggest that a mammoth statue of Robert E. Lee be sculpted as a Confederate memorial on the side of Stone Mountain, Georgia. Personal life Graves married Mattie E. Simpson on April 17, 1878, and Anne (Annie) E. Cothran on December 30, 1890. He had two daughters, Mrs. Frederick Tompkins and Anne Graves; and three sons, John Temple Graves Jr., James de Graffenried Graves, and Cothran Calhoun Graves.

Her work on deciphering chemical data for granite rocks led her to collect and correspond information with geologists from all around the world. The multiple associations with which she worked include the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Washington Academy of Sciences, the Geological Society of London, the Mineralogical Society of Great Britain and Ireland, the American Geophysical Union, the Geological Society of America, and the Mineralogical Association of Canada. She also worked as a delegate of the International Geological Congresses for their 19th, 20th, 23rd, and 24th meetings. Her contributions to Geology have been recognized with an award created in her name at Syracuse University to recognize and aid exceptional student research.  Early life and education  Hooker was born in Flushing, New York. She attended Hunter College in New York City. There, she worked towards a B.A. in the field of Geology which she received in 1929. Hooker went on to Syracuse University to continue her studies and received a M.A. in Geology in 1933. From 1933 to 1937 she continued her graduate studies at Columbia University and George Washington University.  Research career  Hooker spent 30 years writing bibliographies and studying rocks and minerals. Though most of her studies on rocks and minerals were through past data of notable geologists, Hooker was also responsible for compiling geological data from literature from different regions in the world. One of Hooker's most recognized published bibliography was Data of Rock Analyses volumes 1-5. In these volumes she compiles a list of literature from the years 1914‚Äì1953 pertaining to the chemical analyses of igneous and metamorphic rocks. Hooker categorizes the literature based on which country they were published in, including the countries of Africa, New Zealand, Iceland, and Australia. Hooker also organized the literature from 1866‚Äì1968 that prioritized the chemical analysis of igneous and metamorphic rock in the Puerto Rican region. Due to this work 90% of the published igneous and metamorphic rocks found on the Greater and Lesser Antilles are on a magnetic tape in a form retrievable by rock type, location, and other parameters. Hooker could have published more papers but her standards were sometimes too high. Hooker was also interested in writing about lesser-known histories of the geological field, such as the term Nu√©e ardente which she put much research into. French geologist Alfred Lacroix coined this term and Hooker published writings on Lacroix's accounts and reports in the early 1900s when studying the Mount Pel√©e eruptions. This published works was called The Origin of the Volcanological Concept Nu√©e Ardente.  Contributions and awards  Hooker's notable contribution to the field of scientific bibliography and her devotion in multiple scientific societies is globally-recognized. Through her career as an organizer in Mineralogical Abstracts, she authored sixty-four articles. Her active participation towards improving the development of the geological societies led her to establish and maintain communication with other geologists from around the world. In addition to her participation in a great number of scientific association across the world including Great Britain, Japan, Ireland, Switzerland, Canada and United States, she also served consecutive terms as the representative of the International Geological Congress (19th, 20th, 23rd and 24th terms). Due to her profound contribution to the field of geology, she was honored with the position of secretary of the General Meeting from the 7th term until her death. Following her death in 1976, she was posthumously honored with the Alexander Winchell Distinguished Award from Syracuse University, and to recognize her exceptional contributions to the field of geology, an award was created in her name to recognize outstanding students and aid their research.  Personal life  Hooker's life was highly dedicated to science. The majority of her life and her personal interests were connected to her involvement in scientific societies all around the world. The back room in her home in Silver Spring, Maryland was turned into the office for the Mineralogical Society of America. Hooker had many visitors from around the world, as she would host visitors from foreign countries when they came to America to work on geological affairs. The Montgomery Hills area of Silver Spring was where she worked to assist with local community affairs. One of these community affairs included being a judge for a Science fair. She also played the violin. She brought her violin with her on many different trips to different countries. Hooker had two sisters, Elsie and Vera, who continued to live in New York after her death.

The game follows the starlets of the top idol group \\"Project 47\\" as they partake in an event titled \\"Dream of Dream\\" to become the central idol of the group. Those who fail in the competition are killed.  Premise  The game centers on a television reality show titled \\"Dream of Dream\\", set within a desolate old mansion named the \\"House of Seven Moons\\", where a central idol is set to be chosen from the members of popular idol group \\"Project 47\\". According to the game, \\"Project 47\\" is named after the 47 prefectures of Japan, and within the game's world is the largest and popular idol group in the country; the \\"Dream of Dream\\" contest is broadcast throughout Japan. The \\"Dream of Dream\\" event happens once a year, with the game's premise being the tenth reiteration. However, it is a lot different from usual, as lower-ranked idols are also included and no script was given; thus, the selection standards and how the winner is chosen remains unknown. Within \\"Project 47\\" are seven different teams, such as \\"Team Happy\\" (representing Kanto), \\"Team Smile\\" (representing Kansai), \\"Team Passion\\" (representing Kyushu) and \\"Team Rising\\" (representing both Hokkaido and Tohoku); amounting in total to over 200 contestants, sorted by rank. Central characters include: *Mariko Kamata (voiced by Azumi Asakura), a veteran idol with 10 years of experience, having taken part in the first graduating class. She is a member of Team Happy, and is currently ranked 88th. *Chiharu Chigasaki (voiced by Emi Uema), an orthodox rookie idol who puts in great effort.

She is a member of Team Rising, and is currently ranked 1st. *Doripaku (voiced by Kappei Yamaguchi), a pink-costumed character with an appearance of a tapir who takes part in \\"Dream of Dream\\" as the program's host. He is a \\"mysterious\\" character who claims he came \\"to make the world much more interesting\\", and enjoys \\"manipulating people's emotions and lives\\".  Gameplay  Gameplay showing exploration The player plays as one idol appearing in the \\"Dream of Dream\\" event, experiencing the game from that character's point of view. Depending on the character they choose, Idol Death Game TVs plotline changes accordingly. The game features exploration, judging, and \\"Death Concert\\" elements. During exploration, players search for items throughout each stage and share information with other idols, raising their own spirits while lowering those of their opponents. During the judging parts, the player and other idols are judged based upon their dancing and performance, with the last-placed idol heading to the \\"Death Concert\\". During \\"Death Concert\\", idols whom again fail are killed. However, by clearing the trials of Doripaku, defeated characters can be revived. The player's own actions change which characters survive. Thus, they can replay the game multiple times with different characters. \\"Dream Coins\\" serves as the in-game currency of Idol Death Game TV and are required to win a \\"Death Concert\\" as well as to receive judgement for each stage. They can also be used to purchase items which helps the player to avoid elimination. \\"Dream Coins\\" are obtained by searching the mansions and talking to other idols. After a certain amount of time, players also receive \\"Dream Coins\\" based on the number of fans they have. Plays can also steal \\"Dream Coins\\" from their competitors by participating in \\"Baku Royale\\"s, a one-on-one battle with another idol where the player aims to combine \\"Bakuro Words\\" (Exposure Words) and hit their opponent with a scandal which may put an end to their opponent's idol career. Doripaku judges who wins and hurls bombs at the loser. The objective of Idol Death Game TV is to be the last idol standing, winning the judging of each stage whilst entertaining the audience, thus allowing them to become the central idol of \\"Project 47\\". Each character has a genre that they excel in when it comes to singing and dancing. The game is lost when the player loses a \\"Death Concert\\".  Development  A countdown teaser website and Twitter account by D3 Publisher for a \\"new idol project\\" was launched in late June to promote the game, which itself was officially announced on July 3. The game's official website was launched on July 17, and additional details were released in the July 24 issue of Weekly Famitsu. The debut trailer was released on August 15.

She served as associate editor of the Woman's Temperance Publishing Association's Union Signal. Ames died in 1891 at the age of 30. The year after her death, the journalist and spiritualist W. T. Stead published automatic writing which was said to have been sent by Ames to her friend. Stead also created \\"Julie's Bureau\\" to allow others to communicate with the dead. Early years and education Julia A. (nickname, \\"Yolande\\") Ames was born near Odell, Illinois, 14 October 1861. She was the daughter of Isaac Ames (1824-1894), a well-known, wealthy citizen of Streator, Illinois, and Aurelia Ann Mooar Ames (1823-1898). Her siblings were John C Ames, Fannie Ophelia Ames, and Elmer Elsworth Ames. In her childhood, she was always very small and delicate, but as she grew older, her health became vigorous. Ames began attending school at the age of three, as it was lonely for her to be left at home when the older children left. She attended every day that summer and learned to read. The schoolhouse was one of the first to be built in that part of the country. Her father helped to b construct it and taught the first school lesson ever, becoming the headmaster later in his life. The name of the Ames schoolhouse stayed with it and made it a sort of monument to the first schoolmaster, who was, like his youngest daughter, a devoted lover of learning. Ames' brother Elmer was two years younger than she, was always her companion and a playmate. As they grew up they lost none of their devotion to each other. Her elder and only sister accompanied Ames on Sunday mornings along with their grandfather to the little schoolhouse where religious services were held, in which they always participated. Like that, she grew until she was seven years old, when the family moved to Streator, Illinois. She was 12 years old, when she was converted, having attended six weeks of revival meeting in the old church in Streator. The Methodist Church is not particularly rigid, so that her breezy spirit lost none of its elasticity from being developed in a religious atmosphere so highly charged. She entered Streator Township High School in 1873, where she took a four-year course, and soon distinguished herself by her fondness for English literature and history. She was an excellent reader. Her quaint humor and remarkable good-nature made her a fine entertainer at the public exhibitions, where the literary society frequently gave presentations. Beginning in September 1879, she attended Wesleyan University, at Bloomington, Illinois, studying literature, history, art and aesthetics, as well as some of the languages and natural sciences. She was a member of the Munsellian literary society, and Kappa Gamma Greek sorority. At Wesleyan, she met Professor Susan M. D. Fry, an accomplished teacher, whom she always loved not only as an instructor, but as a most helpful and intimate friend. She left Wesleyan in June, 1881. She later graduated from the Chicago School of Oratory (now Columbia College Chicago). Career For years, it was her thought that she would become a missionary, and when she decided to go into the temperance work one of her friends told her: \\"Julia, you have then relinquished the old idea of being a missionary?\\" whereupon she responded in her quick, bright way, \\"No, indeed, I am still thinking of it very strongly;\\" but she speedily found that temperance was really practical missionary work. Helen Louise Hood first became acquainted with Ames in the summer of 1885 at the Lake Bluff (Illinois) Training School, but their real acquaintance did not begin until the Women's Christian Temperance Union's(WCTU) National Convention which was held a few months later at Philadelphia. On their way to the Convention, Ames was made a delegate by the Illinois white-ribboners. On the way back home, they talked long and earnestly about her future, Hood urging Ames to come and cast in her lot with the \\"white-ribboners\\". During this homeward ride, Matilda Carse was in the car reading a novel Yolande, by William Black. Seeing a resemblance in the character of the heroine of this book to Ames, Carse called her, requested to kneel and touched her head, then she kissed her lovingly on the forehead and said: \\"Arise! I dub thee, Yolande\\" - a name by which she was known afterwards by all of her associates. On her return, Yolande became actively engaged in the work of the Chicago Central Union, one of the oldest and most influential unions in the city. She instituted the work which would be presented to the papers of that city and featured in weekly items of temperance news, which made her the Press Superintendent for The Union. Later, she became very much interested in the Bethesda Mission, which was conducted by the Chicago Union, and situated on Clark Street, one of the worst streets of the city. Here every Sunday, Ames could be found teaching in the Sunday school. This mission, as well as the one for the homeless and friendless women, which the WCTU cared for, had an active worker in Ames. The mission for women was named by her \\"The Anchorage,\\" and for a long time, she kept a white lily on the windows of its reading room, so that the outcast women who passed its windows might see this pure flower, and, being attracted, might come in and learn of a better life. In the spring of 1886, Ames' family moved from Chicago, her brother, Elmer, having finished law school, has gone west. As for Ames, she came to live at Rest Cottage. The first of the Chicago's daily published newspapers was a WCTU department's the Chicago Inter Ocean. In her first interviews with the editors, Ames' work was often disregarded and not published, cut. At first, only a few inches of space were provided for her texts. This space however, was gradually increased as editors learned that she was trustworthy. However, she began to occupy nearly a column, and editors ceased to cut her manuscript, again. But soon, more important work got her attention. When the national superintendent of press-work, Esther Housh, needed an assistant, Ames received the appointment. Her connection with the central union brought her into intimate contact with other women, among whom, in addition to Hood and Carse, were Elizabeth Wheeler Andrew, and Frances Willard, these women and conversations with them moulded Ames' views. When Andrew felt that her health was deteriorating, she decided to give up her work on the Union Signal, the question of her successor was earnestly discussed. The thoughts of the leaders at once turned to Ames, and despite her youth, she justified the choice of those who urged her to succeed Andrew. Up to 1889, her specialities were the news from the field and children's department. She founded the department of illustrated biography and the queen's garden. Her forte was not so much writing, though she was ready with her pen, as it was the ability to choose or reject others' writing, and the winning power to draw from them their best thoughts. In 1889, she had sole charge of the Union Signal in the absence of the editor. Julia Ames (1890) She visited Europe in 1890, being gone for months, and satisfied some of her longings for the beautiful, in the scenes she visited, the paintings and statues she saw. While in England, she became acquainted with Lady Henry Somerset at Eastnor Castle, who afterwards became another strong factor in her life, giving her love and trust which lasted up until her death. In her letters, and on her return, Ames was full of praise for Lady Somerset ‚Äî recognizing the fact that she was a great leader. Ames was received with honour by the British Woman's Temperance Association. While in London, she organized the press department of that society on lines similar to those of the American organization. She travelled through Europe with a party accompanied by Sarah E. Morgan, under the auspices of Mrs. M. B. Willard's school for girls. She witnessed the Passion Play at Oberammergau, visited Rome and other cities, and finally returned to the U.S. to resume her editorial duties at \\"Union Signal\\". She attended the Boston convention in November, 1891, in her editorial capacity. She assisted in editing of daily Union Signal, prepared the Associated Press dispatches each night, and was the chairman of one or two committees. Ames was a member of the Woman's Temperance Publishing Association, Circle of King's Daughters, and was president of that organization when she left Chicago for her European tour. The silver cross and the white ribbon were the symbols of her life. Death and Letters from Julia Ames met William Thomas Stead in 1890. She was not well when she left Chicago, and she contracted a severe cold, which through the pressure of her work developed into typhoid pneumonia, of which she died December 12, 1891, in Boston, and was buried at Riverview Cemetery, in Streator. In 1897, Stead published a collection of communications he states were received from Ames to her friend, Miss E., entitled Letters from Julie. In 1909, he established \\"Julia's Bureau\\", an organization founded \\"to enable those who had lost their dead, who were sorrowing over friends and relatives, to get in touch with them again\\".

It is the oldest church structure in town. History A church at the site was present by the mid-12th century, built initially in Romanesque-style and affiliated with a Benedictine monastery, derived and subsidiary to the Abbey of Fonte Avellana. By the 17th century, the church became property of the Bishop of Recanati. The gabled facade was refurbished in the thirteenth century: into the facade are inserted two Gothic round rose windows, one semicircular lunette window, and a rounded stone portal decorated with a bas-relief of the Madonna Enthroned with Archangels Michael and Gabriel (1253) sculpted by Mastro Nicola Anconetano. The bell- tower at the rear of the church dates to the 12th century, and was found to have 15th-century fresco fragments inside that are attributed to Pietro da Recanati. The Romanesque interior is subdivided into a nave and two lateral aisles by sturdy pilasters and rounded arches. The presbytery with the altar is separated by flanking arches from the nave, a separation common in churches belonging to cloistered orders. The stone cross, currently above the baptismal font, was formerly in the central rose window. A fresco depicting a Madonna and Child is attributed to Pietro di Domenico da Montepulciano.

A dodomeki (Áôæ„ÄÖÁõÆÈ¨º) is a Japanese y≈çkai that's depicted as human women who are cursed with having long arms covered with hundreds of bird eyes due to their habit of stealing money. It is also called the todomeki. Mythology Dodomeki were first described by the 18th century Japanese scholar Toriyama Sekien. The long arms of a dodomeki reflects the Japanese belief that a person with long arms has a tendency to steal. The bird eyes that grows on the dodomeki's arm are a reference to the Japanese d≈çsen, a copper coin with a hole in the middle of it that's commonly known as the ch≈çmoku (Birds eye). Legends=Conflict with Fujiwara no Hidesato During the Heian period, a kuge (court bureaucrat) named Fujiwara no Hidesato had just defeated the rebel Taira no Masakado and been promoted as the kokushi of the Shimotsuke province for his victory. One day while hunting in his newly acquired territory, Hidesato encountered an old man who warned him about a y≈çkai who had been terrorizing a nearby horse graveyard at night. Hidesato went to the horse graveyard to investigate and waited until sundown for the y≈çkai to appear. Once the y≈èkai arrived, it revealed itself to be a dodomeki that stood over ten foot tall and had arms covered with hundreds of glowing eyes. Hidesato drew his bow and shot an arrow at the brightest glowing eye, causing the dodomeki to flee and collapse near Mount My≈çjin. When Hidesato later pursued the y≈çkai, the dodomeki emitted a burst of flame from its body and a fume of poisonous gas from its mouth. Outmatched, Hidesato fled from the scene and returned the next day to find the ground heavily burnt, but no sign of the dodomeki. Meeting Priest Chitoku Nearly 400 years later during the Muromachi period, a priest named Chitoku was called to investigate a series of unexplained fires that broke out at the temple in a village near Mount My≈çjin. He started to notice a woman covered with a robe near the temple whenever he held his sermons and discovered that she was the same dodomeki that Hidesato had fought 400 years earlier. She had come back to suck up her remaining toxic fumes and blood that she lost during her last battle with Hidesato. The temple was built on top of the battle site, so the dodomeki caused a series of fires to scare all the priests away. However, after consistently overhearing Chitoku preaching whenever she walked by the temple, the dodomeki became enlightened and vowed to never commit any more evil deeds for the rest of her life. In popular culture * The Todomeki appears in the Shin Megami Tensei franchise. * In the Yo-kai Watch franchise, the Todomeki is a black humanoid monster with 13 eyes and horns. It is known as Eyesoar in the English dub. * In the light novel series and later manga adaptation of Re:Monster, one of the hobgoblin members of the monster clan evolved into a dodomeki.

Background The Exarchate of Africa was in internal turmoil due to the conflict between the mainly Orthodox Chalcedonian population and the supporters of Monotheletism, an attempt at compromise between Chalcedonianism and Monophysitism devised and promoted by Emperor Heraclius in 638. In 642‚Äì643, the Arabs had seized Cyrenaica and the eastern half of Tripolitania, along with Tripoli. It was only an order from Caliph Umar (r. 634‚Äì644) that halted their westward expansion.Diehl (1896), pp. 557‚Äì558 In 646, the exarch Gregory the Patrician launched a rebellion against Emperor Constans II. The obvious reason was the latter's support for Monotheletism, but it undoubtedly was also a reaction to the Muslim conquest of Egypt, and the threat it presented to Byzantine Africa. The revolt seems to have found broad support among the populace as well, not only among the Romanized Africans, but also among the Berbers of the provincial hinterland. Battle In 647, Umar's successor Uthman ordered Abdallah ibn Sa'ad to invade the Exarchate with 20,000 men. The Muslims invaded western Tripolitania and advanced up to the northern boundary of the Byzantine province of Byzacena. Gregory confronted the Arabs on their return at Sufetula, but was defeated and killed.Pringle (1981), p. 47 Agapius of Hierapolis and some Syriac sources claim that he survived the defeat and fled to Constantinople, where he was reconciled with Constans, but most modern scholars accept the Arab chroniclers' account of his death in battle. The Arab accounts also claim that the Muslims captured Gregory's daughter, who had fought at her father's side. She was carried back to Egypt as part of the booty, but she fell from her camel on the march and was killed.Diehl (1896), p. 559 Aftermath After Gregory's death, the Arabs sacked Sufetula and raided across the Exarchate, while the Byzantines withdrew to their fortresses. Unable to storm the Byzantine fortifications, and satisfied with the huge amounts of plunder they had made, the Arabs agreed to depart in exchange for the payment of a heavy tribute in gold.Diehl (1896), pp. 559‚Äì560 Despite the fact that the Arab raid was not followed up for some time, and the restoration of ties with Constantinople, Byzantine rule over Africa was shaken to its roots by Gregory's rebellion and the Arab victory. The Berber tribes in particular shook off their allegiance to the Empire, and most of southern Tunisia seems to have slipped outside the control of Carthage.Diehl (1896), pp. 560‚Äì561 Thus the Battle of Sufetula marked \\"the end, more or less near, but inevitable, of Byzantine domination in Africa\\".Diehl (1896), p. 562 ReferencesBibliography * * Category:647 Category:640s conflicts Category:Battles involving the Byzantine Empire Category:Battles involving the Rashidun Caliphate Category:Battles of the Arab‚ÄìByzantine wars Battle of Sufetula Category:Byzantine North Africa Category:640s in the Byzantine Empire Category:640s in the Rashidun Caliphate ","title":"Battle of Sufetula"},{"id":"52194815","text":"Eucalyptus diversifolia, commonly known as the soap mallee, coastal white mallee, South Australian coastal mallee, or coast gum is a species of mallee that is endemic to an area along the southern coast of Australia. It has smooth bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between seven and eleven, white to creamy yellow flowers and cup-shaped fruit. Description Eucalyptus diversifolia is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, mainly cream-coloured and grey bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have sessile, egg-shaped to elliptic leaves arranged in opposite pairs, long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same olive-green or bluish-green on both sides, lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven, nine or eleven in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are diamond-shaped, long and wide with a conical to beaked operculum. Flowering occurs between July and September or December to January and the flowers are white to cream-yellow flowers. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped capsule long and wide, sessile or on a pedicel up to long with the valves about level with the rim. The seeds are smooth glossy brown and pyramidal. Taxonomy Eucalyptus diversifolia was first formally described by the botanist Aim√© Bonpland in 1814 and the description was published in his book Description des Plantes Rares cultivees a Malmaison et a Navarre. Three subspecies were described in 1987 by Ian Wright and Pauline Ladiges and two of these are recognised by the Australian Plant Census (APC): * Eucalyptus diversifolia subsp. diversifolia has smooth bark and cup-shaped fruit less than in diameter; * Eucalyptus diversifolia subsp. hesperia has a short skirt of rough bark at the base and fruit that is usually smaller than in subspecies diversifolia. Eucalyptus diversifolia subsp. megacarpa is regarded as a synonym of E. diversifolia subsp. diversifolia by the APC but is an accepted subspecies in Victoria and has fruit that is in diameter. This species is part of the Eucalyptus subgenus series Diversiformae, a group of mallees that all have adult leaves held erect, buds with a single unscarred operculum and pyramidal seeds. The other species in this series include E. erectifolia, E. platydisca, E. pachyloma, E. todtiana, E. lateritica, E. dolorosa and E. buprestium. The specific epithet (diversifolia) is derived from the Latin words diversus meaning \\"different\\" and folium meaning \\"leaf\\".Backer, C.A. (1936). Verklarend woordenboek der wetenschappelijke namen van de in Nederland en Nederlandsch-Indi√´ in het wild groeiende en in tuinen en parken gekweekte varens en hoogere planten (Edition Nicoline van der Sijs). Distribution Soap mallee grows in soils derived from limestone, often on exposed headlands. Subspecies diversifolia is found on the Eyre and lower Yorke Peninsulas, on Kangaroo Island in South Australia and eastwards to the Cape Nelson State Park with an isolated population near Aireys Inlet in Victoria, but it is absent from the Nullarbor Plain in far western South Australia. Subspecies hesperia occurs west of the Nullarbor Plain between Eucla, Caiguna, Cocklebiddy and Madura. Uses This species is able to produce large amounts of biomass, making per hectare per year. In wheatbelt regions it is also beneficial as the tree will reduce salinity, give shade to stock, act as a windbreak and reduce erosion.

He completed his M.Sc. from Ballygunge Campus of Calcutta University . After securing a PhD from Jadavpur University, he joined the Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (IICB) as a research fellow in 1998 and on completion of the fellowship in 2003, he moved to Friedrich Miescher Institute where he did his post-doctoral studies from 2004 to 2008 on a Human Frontier Science Program fellowship. Returning to India the same year, he joined IICB as a scientist at the Molecular and Human Genetics Division. He heads the RNA Biology Research Laboratory (RBRL, popularly known as Bhattacharyya Lab) of the institute where serves as the principal investigator and hosts a number of research scholars.  Legacy  Skin ulcer due to leishmaniasis. Bhattacharyya's researches at RBRL is mainly on microRNA (miRNA), focusing on its compartmentalization, regulation and mediation as well as its alteration in Leishmania invaded macrophage and neighboring non-macrophage cells. His researches assisted in identifying cholesterol as a modulator in leishmaniasis infection and his team has developed a therapeutic protocol for treating leishmaniasis by administering microRNA molecules in patients which has been found to raise the cholesterol level which in turn reduced the parasite levels. The treatment, combined with other drugs have been reported to be effective in treating the disease commonly known as Kala azar, which has a reported high drug resistance. One of his earlier projects, Mechanism of mRNA compartmentalization in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells, was funded by the Wellcome Trust. On his current project, miRNA and Stability, he has worked on the mammalian immune and cancer cells and reportedly discovered miRNA activity modulation mechanisms in those cells. At his laboratory, Bhattacharyya mentors many post-doctoral and doctoral researchers. He has published several articles in peer-reviewed journals and the online knowledge repositories which have listed his articles include ResearchGate, Google Scholar, and PubMed. He is a member of the Neurobiology Task force of the Department of Biotechnology and was a member of Local Organizing Committee of the APSN-ISN Neuroscience School held in January 2014.

Navr√°til was born in Germany where his father was a consul. In 1937 he became a Scout in Prague. He was arrested and held several months by the Gestapo during World War II. In 1949, he tried to oppose the Communist takeover of Czechoslovakia with other Scouts. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison, and was released in 1960. He took part in the renewal of Scouting in Czechoslovakia in 1968.

In response to Bryant's outspoken anti-gay views and her Save Our Children campaign, thousands of members of the Houston LGBT community and their supporters marched through the city to the venue in protest on June 16, 1977. The protests have been called \\"Houston's Stonewall\\" and set into motion the major push for LGBT rights in Houston. Background Houston's LGBT community has existed since probably the beginning of the city, but did not take off in full swing until the 1960s. Montrose became the city's gayborhood, evolving into a center of gay culture. By 1968, 26 gay bars were located in Montrose. Like for much of the United States, the 1969 Stonewall riots did not forward LGBT rights in Houston as much as they did in New York City. In part because Houston at the time was mostly considered a Bible Belt city. In 1970, a chapter of the Gay Liberation Front formed at the University of Houston but disbanded in 1973; another group called Integrity formed the same year. Political groups were also formed; the Gay Political Coalition formed in 1973 and advocated for anti-gay legislation to be repealed and protections to be installed. This was followed in 1975 by the Gay Political Caucus (GPC), which had much of the same goals. One other event spurred movement within the LGBT Houston community. Harris County Comptroller of the Treasury Gary van Ooteghem attended a county commissioner's court meeting to support gay and lesbian rights in response to Leonard Matlovich's struggle in the United States Army. In the meeting, van Ooteghem publicly came out as gay, although his employer Harris County Treasurer Harsell Gray told van Ooteghem beforehand that he was not allowed to participate in politics. Van Ooteghem was dismissed from his position, an event that was widely publicized and led to van Ooteghem being elected the GPC's first president. Additionally, police raids on gay bars were common at this time. In 1976, police shot and killed Gary Wayne Stock, a bartender at the gay bar Inside/Outside, stating Stock had run a red light and was shot in self-defense. In the planning for the Anita Bryant demonstration every leader in the community participated. Designers created logos and fliers, Fred Paez and Ray Hill negotiated with the Houston Police Department for a non-confrontational and orderly event. Hill was assigned to co-ordinate the marshals and liaison with the police during the march and demonstration. Protests The Hyatt Hotel in downtown Houston was chosen for the Texas State Bar Association's meeting on June 16, 1977. The TSBA invited country singer Anita Bryant to perform and speak at the meeting. Bryant was also an outspoken opponent of gay rights and had led a campaign called Save Our Children in Dade County, Florida to repeal an anti-discrimination ordinance that protected gay people. The TSBA distributed 28,500 pamphlets advertising Bryant's appearance. Many members of the LGBT community denounced the invitation, and it was quickly rescinded. However, shortly after a second invitation was sent to Bryant, inviting her only to sing; the TSBA cited a mistake that resulted in the second invitation being delivered. With the LGBT community not politically sound enough to prevent her from attending, Bryant was scheduled to appear at the meeting. On the day of the meeting on June 16, 1977, Reverend Joe West held an anti-gay meeting at Houston City Hall. at 8:00 pm, about 3,000 protesters, consisting of members of the LGBT community and their allies, gathered in the Depository Bar parking lot in Montrose at the corners of Bagby and McGowen Streets. Members of the crowd wore black armbands with pink triangles. They then peacefully marched past the Hyatt Hotel to the Houston Public Library (HPL). There, then-publisher of The Advocate David B. Goodstein, actress Liz Torres, and founder of the Metropolitan Community Church Reverend Troy Perry addressed the crowd. By the time the crowd reached the HPL, numbers had grown to between 8,000 and 10,000 protesters. 10 attorneys in attendance walked out of the TSBA meeting and joined the crowd, themselves wearing armbands. The protest then turned into a candlelight vigil. Police in riot gear were stationed at the protest site. Inside the Hyatt Hotel, Bryant's performance received a standing ovation. Aftermath and legacy Former GPC president Larry Bagneris called the demonstration \\"the first major political act that we, as gay people, took on in Houston.\\" A minister at Houston's Gay Pride Parade in 1978 said, \\"It took Anita Bryant to bring this many of our brothers and sisters out of their closets.\\" Gay activist Ray Hill stated, \\"Houston's gay and lesbian community actually became a community. Before Anita, gay community meant where the bars were; after Anita, gay community meant people.\\" More LGBT members subsequently became active in politics, and elected officials began searching for their input. In 1978, an event called Town Meeting I was held, during which Houston gays and lesbians met to discuss political and social issues they faced. By 1980, the community had gained an unprecedented amount of recognition, and gay ally Kathy Whitmire won the race for City Controller on a GPC endorsement. The march itself eventually became the Houston Gay Pride Parade. It was also covered in Bruce Remington's 1983 thesis, \\"Twelve Fighting Years: Homosexuals in Houston, 1969-1981,\\" which is one of the few existing pieces of literature about the early Houston LGBT community.

It contains a single species, Triopticus primus, described in 2016 by Stocker et al. It has an unusually domed head reminiscent of the later pachycephalosaurian dinosaurs in an example of convergent evolution. Description The portion of the head that is preserved shows remarkable similarities to the specialized heads of pachycephalosaurs. Five bosses, or rounded protuberances of bone are visible on the fossil, with one on the frontal bone and two pairs behind (respectively on the postorbital bone and the squamosal/parietal bones) separated by a shallow groove. The backmost pair of bosses form a thick shelf that stretches outwards and backwards over the rear end of the skull, comparable to the domes of pachycephalosaurs and the frills of ceratopsians. The bosses have very roughly textured surfaces, suggesting that they would have been covered by keratin in life. CT scans show that the bosses internally have three distinct layers of bone, with an dense innermost layer which resembles the typical skull roof in texture, followed by a spongy, porous layer filled with blood vessels, and the least dense third layer close to the surface. Pachycephalosaurs like Stegoceras also similarly have three layers of bone inside its dome, but the second layer is the least dense as opposed to the third. However, this difference may arise from differential deposition of minerals in the skull. The deep pit in the back of the skull of Triopticus likely arises from the two back pairs of bosses growing around this region, not unlike the holes of doughnuts. It is also possible that the pit is an opening for the pineal gland, as it is in approximately the right position, but this is less likely because no other archosauriforms have such an opening, and the opening does not appear to be connected to any internal structures. The pit has the same texture as the bosses, suggesting that it was also potentially covered in keratin. The eye socket is very large, and it is surrounded by mineralized cartilage, a trait only seen otherwise in pachycephalosaurs. CT scans also revealed large optic nerves as well as long semicircular canals and a relatively large cerebellar flocculus (both involved in stabilizing gaze, although long semicircular canals are also associated with bipedal stances). These traits suggest that Triopticus was a very visually-oriented animal. Otherwise, the structure of the brain is generally similar to other archosauriforms, although it superficially resembles that of Stegoceras. Despite the heavy similarity of Triopticus to pachycephalosaurs, there are a number of traits that indicate its archosauriform identity. In Triopticus, the parabasisphenoid bone is horizontal, the posttemporal fenestrae at the back of the braincase are not sealed off at all, and the region where the squamosal bone and quadrate bone come into contact is not externally visible, all of which indicate that it is not a basal dinosaur. Additionally, a narrow strip of smooth bone on the lacrimal bone in front of the eye sockets forms the margin of the antorbital fenestra and the associated antorbital fossa, which are distinctly archosauriform characteristics. Discovery and naming The only known specimen of Triopticus, TMM 31100-1030, consists of a braincase containing part of the eye socket. It was discovered in Quarry 3 of the Otis Chalk in Howard County, Texas, which is part of the Dockum Group. While the Otis Chalk itself has not yet been dated, comparisons with the animal fauna of other sites (including the Pekin Formation of North Carolina) suggest a potential age between 229 Ma and 226 Ma. The genus name of Triopticus is derived from the Latin tri (\\"three\\") and optic (\\"vision\\"), in reference to a large pit in the back of the skull reminiscent of a third eye socket. The species name, primus, is the Latin word for \\"first\\". Classification A phylogenetic analysis was conducted in 2016 in an attempt to elucidate the relationships of Triopticus. The phylogenetic tree recovered by the analysis, reproduced below, found Triopticus in a polytomy with other basal archosauriforms. Paleoecology In the Otis Chalk assemblage, Triopticus lived alongside a number of other archosauriforms including the allokotosaurs Trilophosaurus and Malerisaurus; the doswelliid Doswellia; the phytosaurs Parasuchus and Angistorhinus; the aetosaurs Longosuchus, Lucasuchus, and Coahomasuchus; the shuvosaurid Effigia; the silesaurid Silesaurus; the lagerpetid dinosauromorph Dromomeron, and the coelophysoid theropod dinosaur Lepidus. Some of these also exhibit evolutionary convergence upon archosaurs living after the Triassic‚ÄìJurassic extinction event - the phytosaurs resemble the thalattosuchians, gavialoids, and spinosaurids, the aetosaurs resemble the ankylosaurs, and the shuvosaurids resemble the ornithomimosaurs.

They became of the most popular groups in the Malbourne area and released two singles for HMV Records, including the song \\"Rum Drunk\\", which is now regarded as a garage rock classic. \\"Rum Drunk\\" and several of their other songs have been included on various compilations. History The Moods were formed in Melbourne in 1965. Their original membership consisted of Kevin Frasier (b. 1947) on lead vocals, John Livi (b. 1951) on lead guitar, Mick Hamilton (b. 1948) on rhythm guitar, Peter Noss on bass, and Carl Savona (b. 1949) on drums. John Livi had begun playing guitar at the age of twelve. He was initially influenced by the instrumentals of groups such as the Shadows, and he became adept on the instrument. But, when he heard \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\", by the Beatles, his musical tastes began to shift in favour of the new sounds coming from England. His brother Bernie Livi introduced him to several musician-friends, who wanted to start a Beatles-influenced group, which they named the Moods. Peter Raphael became their manager, and made it possible for them to get regular gigs at local venues, such as at mod clubs, which were all the rage at the time. Like the British groups, the Moods wore long hair (for the times), which caused difficulties at school for John Livi, who was only fourteen, and was instructed by the principal to, either cut his hair, or be expelled. Livi chose to quit school and took business classes in the day and played with the Moods at night. By 1966, restrictive laws in Australia, such as the rule requiring bars to close at 6:00 pm, were relaxed, and the old British monetary system was converted from pence, shillings, and pounds, to a modern decimal system. In February a new music paper, Melbourne, was premiered to great fanfare, and the Moods' manager, Peter Raphael, was the head of its advertising department. Rahael used his position to provide publicity for the group. In addition to ample advertisement space, the band received regular write-ups in columns. Raphael arranged for a record deal with HMV Records, where the group released its debut single, \\"Cos of You\\" b/w \\"Say Hello to Me\\". \\"Cos of You\\" was an upbeat rocker, with a moody folk-inflected flip-side \\"Say Hello to Me\\". Though the single failed to break the national charts, it garnished accolades. DJ Stan Rolfe touted the song in Melbourne and predicted that the Moods would become the most popular group in Australia after the ensuing departure of the Easy Beats to England. The Moods were playing shows almost every night in Melbourne. They toured Adelaide and appeared on two popular television programmes, Go!!, Kommotion, and Sunday Date TV and opened for the Rolling Stones on their 1966 tour of Australia. They played regularly at Myers in-Gear, a popular mod haberdashery, that provided outfitting the group. Bassist Peter Noss departed and was replaced by Ian Ferguson, who had played with Melbourne's Tony and the Shantels. Their next single featured on it is the song for which they have become best-known, \\"Rum Drunk\\", whose lyrics depict the hopeless life of a drunken roustabout. The B-side was \\"I Love You So\\". They recorded the single at Armstrong Studios. Like their first record, it failed to chart. The group was dropped from HMV Records. In 1967, John Levi quit and the band broke up shortly thereafter. Bassist Ian Ferguson joined Running, Jumping, Standing Still. In the 1970s he played in the blues band, Carson. Drummer Carl Savona joined the group Brigade, who released two singles on the Astor label. Paul Anderson became involved with the cabaret act, the City Stompers, who also recorded for Astor. John Livi, despite his talent as a guitarist, left the music business. Mick Hamilton became a session musician, playing throughout the world, and in the early 1970s became a member of the group Springfield Revival. In 2002 he released a country and folk-flavoured album, Alone at Last. He has recorded several albums with Keith Glass and others. In 2002 he recorded a solo album entitled Alone at Last. In the intervening years, the Moods have become highly regarded by garage rock commentators and enthusiasts. Australian music historian Dean Mittlehousen has mentioned them as one of his favourite groups from the era. Their song, \\"Rum Drunk\\", was included on the Down Under Nuggets: Original Australian Artyfacts 1965‚Äì1967 compilation put out by Festival Records and on the Ugly Things CD and LP sets issued by Raven Records. \\"Cos of You\\" appeared on Devil's Children, Volume 2 and \\"Say Hello to Me\\" is included on Oz Beat Frenzy, Volume 1. Ian D. Marks has called \\"Rum Drunk\\" \\"an angst- ridden masterpiece\\" and a \\"cult garage classic\\".

Fred Herbert was the first Canadian jockey to win the Kentucky Derby but opportunities to earn a living in American horse racing were severely restricted when the New York Legislature under Republican Governor Charles Evans Hughes passed the Hart‚ÄìAgnew anti- betting legislation with penalties allowing for fines and up to a year in prison. As a result, in 1912 Fred Herbert went to England where his father had been born. There, he would begin winning top level races, notably capturing the May Maiden Plate at Leicester Racecourse, the Wokingham and Norfolk Stakes, the Cesarewitch Handicap in 1913 and the Great Metropolitan Handicap in 1915.

Once the market recovered, they refinanced and invested in ever larger buildings on the Upper West Side and in Brooklyn Heights including the 337 unit Turtle Bay Towers; the historic 479 unit Archive in the West Village, which they converted into lofts; the Cast Iron Building; and the Carnegie Hall Tower. The brothers divided their responsibilities with lawyer Henry responsible for financing; engineer Fred responsible for construction; and Yale and Harvard business school graduate Tom responsible for development and acquisitions. His youngest brother, Jeffrey, would later join the firm as an architect. They took a conservative approach to financing, never borrowing more than 75% of the buildings cost (as compared to the more typical 95%). In the 1990s, they expanded throughout New York City, converting office buildings into apartments in the Financial district and pioneering developments on the Queens waterfront in Long Island City and West Side of Manhattan. They diversified their portfolio into metropolitan Washington D.C. after the September 11 attacks. In August 2008, Henry initiated the dissolving of the partnership. His brothers disagreed with his desire to move the firm more into development rather than renovation and leasing as well as to take on outside partners. They also balked at naming Henry's son, Justin, as successor to the business. They divided the assets into three portfolios and drew straws to determine who would own which portfolio. Henry won the firm's development projects, the right to the Rockrose name, and eight residential buildings with 2,634 apartments. Tom and Fred received the remainder consisting of 5,000 apartments in 13 buildings, the office building portfolio, and their properties in Long Island City and continued on as partners with their new firm TF Cornerstone. The day before they divided their assets, their mother died; the day after, their father died. Under Henry's management, Rockrose has acquired over $600 million in additional properties in New York City and Washington, D.C., and developed the $300 million apartment building, Linc LIC, in Court Square in Long Island City. Personal life In 1965, Elghanayan married Nancy, to whom he rented an apartment while he was in law school. They have three children. Elghanayan is an art collector and philanthropist.

If the player is defeated in battle, the carnival race is over. Then there are different characters, such as the \\"hay rattling\\" (hen's rifle) in the spring gallows, which steals and sells chickens and eggs on the farms. The \\"Schellfaschinge\\" wear short leather pants with white long underpants underneath, a white shirt and a wreath (bell) around the waist and a colorful pointed cap on the head. They run in front of each house a \\"Kranzl\\" (in a circle). They, the so-called \\"fair\\", are followed by the group of \\"Vetteln\\", that is, figures offering or begging their services for money: physician, scissors grinder, cheap Jakob (peddler), Rossh√§ndler with horse, bridal couple, unmarried mother with child and beggars. After a long and strenuous day, there is the meeting of the groups in the village. Evenings are celebrated at the \\"Schinderhochzeit\\" (masked ball). The implementing organizations are the volunteer fire brigade and the music association of the town, which also benefits the revenues.

He was a long-term resident and mining pioneer of Tennant Creek. The historic Tuxworth Fullwood House is named after him. Early life Fullwood was born in London in 1910. He began working in the mining industry from the age of 18. He moved to Perth as a two-year-old. At the age of 14, he began traveling around Western Australia carrying only a swag and his shoes, that he wore only when he arrived at a station to prevent unnecessary wear and tear. Fullwood worked at Meekathara Mine and later at Kartabaya Station. On one journey he walked from Geraldton to Carnarvon. He also met his first wife in 1940. Fullwood enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force in Perth in 1939. He trained as an armorer in the 100th Squadron at Bairnsdale. He later specialised in aircraft hydraulics and was stationed in different parts of New Guinea. After the war, Fullwood worked in mining in Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia. Fullwood moved to Tennant Creek in 1947, hitching a ride from Alice Springs to take up a job constructing shafts on the Mount Samuel mine. He described the town as \\"pretty rough\\" and \\"dusty\\" at the time. He then went on to develop and manage the Whippet mining lease and then worked in a variety of roles at Nobles Nob mine. He also took up gold mining leases of his own. By 1954 he became an agent servicing the Warrumunga Goldfield. Fullwood met his second wife Marjorie Cowan in Tennant Creek. They married in April 1950 in Kalgoorlie in Western Australia, returning to Tennant Creek shortly after. They built their own home from scrap metal sourced from Darwin after World War II. Art career Bill Fullwood's Mural on Leichhardt Street Fullwood took up watercolour painting while recovering in Darwin after an accident, eventually switching to oil paints. The majority of his works are held by the Country Women's Association's Tennant Creek Branch as part of the Tennant Creek Art Collection. He was also a musician, who played mandolin and piano accordion. Later life In later life, Fullwood was committed to preserving Tennant Creek's history. He was critical to the development of the mining museum, housed in the Tuxworth Fullwood House, a former World War II hospital now after him and Hilda Tuxworth. Fullwood died on 17 February 2005 from pneumonia. He is buried in the Tennant Creek Cemetery with his wife Marjorie.
