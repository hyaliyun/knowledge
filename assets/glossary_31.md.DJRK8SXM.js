Jaffray was retained as White House head housekeeper in 1909, a position then equivalent to that of a majordomo. Recruited from an \\"exclusive New York employment bureau\\", she became the first female chief servant in White House history. One of Jaffray's earliest, and most controversial, moves was to order the segregation of dining among White House staff. Prior to Jaffray, Caucasian and African-American butlers and valets would dine together, while lower-ranked servants such as maids and footmen would dine separately, though also at a racially integrated table. Jaffrey ordered that the two dining tables be arranged by race, instead of rank. When servants rebelled against the move she threatened mass firings, gaining their ultimate obedience. During her time at the White House she came to be regarded by employees as \\"a real terror\\". According to Major Archibald Butt, the aide de camp to President William Howard Taft, Jaffray claimed to have \\"seen and felt\\" the ghost of a child she believed was William Wallace Lincoln on several occasions in 1912, around the fiftieth anniversary of his death. The same year she would fret over the corpulent Taft's eating habits, prompting him to promise to go on a diet. Jaffray used horses as a means of transport longer than anyone else at the White House, continuing to be chauffeured in a brougham for her daily shopping excursions into the mid 1920s. Jaffray remained at the White House for 17 years and left in 1926 during the presidency of Calvin Coolidge. Jaffray had reportedly become disgusted by Coolidge's austere spending on White House entertaining; Coolidge, in turn, referred to Jaffray by the nickname \\"queenie\\". Grace Coolidge expressed relief at Jaffray's departure, musing that \\"she has come to consider herself the permanent resident and the President and his family transients\\". Following her departure Jaffray wrote Secrets of the White House. Published by Cosmopolitan, the book was a tell-all about her time at the executive mansion. She was portrayed by actress Cloris Leachman in the 1979 NBC mini-series Backstairs at the White House.‚ÄúEight Stars Set for NBC‚Äôs Series on the White House.‚Äù The Los Angeles Times, 6 April 1978Hanauer, Joan.‚ÄúNew mini-series unveils White House family life.‚Äù Hutchinson News, 29 January 1979 She died May 2, 1934 and is buried in an unmarked grave in Ontario, Canada.

Construction, acquisition, and commissioning Lotosland-a yacht built in 1929 by Pusey and Jones of Wilmington, Delaware-was purchased from Col. Edward A. Deeds on 16 October 1940 for use as a coastal minesweeper and was renamed Siren (CMc-1). On 15 November 1940, she was commissioned and redesignated a patrol yacht, PY-13. Siren was converted for military use at the General Engineering & Ship Works yards in Neponset, Mass. Her conversion completed by mid-March. Siren reported on the 18th for duty to the Commandant of the 1st Naval District. Service history From her home yard, Boston, she patrolled the New England coast from Eastport, Maine, to Block Island, Rhode Island. For almost a year, from March 1941 until February 1942, Siren served with the Inshore Patrol, at first on Neutrality Patrol and then, after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 and Germany's declaration of war on the following day, in the actual defense of the United States shoreline. On 10 February 1942, Siren was reassigned to the Eastern Sea Frontier. This change was part of the Navy's response to the German submarine offensive of 1942 which was centered in the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. During this and her next assignment-to the Commander, Atlantic Fleet-from December 1942 until April 1944, Siren patrolled and escorted convoys along the southeastern coast of the United States and between the islands of the Caribbean. Her duties during these two assignments carried her to such places as Trinidad, Jamaica, Cuba, and Key West. On one occasion, she even ventured as far south as Recife, Brazil. During this period, Siren rescued survivors of a U-boat sunk by a Navy PBY patrol plane. After a short period assigned to the 7th Naval District at Key West, Florida, in April 1944, she was transferred to the 3d Naval District at New York City for duty at the Naval Training School (Salvage). Siren was decommissioned at New York on 2 May 1944 and was placed in service. She served at the Naval Training School (Salvage) until 3 March 1945, when she sailed for temporary duty in the 8th Naval District at Orange, Texas. On 3 October 1945, she arrived at Tompkinsville, New York, to begin preparing for lay-up; and she was placed out of service there on 23 October 1945. Siren was struck from the Navy list on 13 November 1945 and turned over to the War Shipping Administration for disposal. She was sold on 13 August 1946.

History In the 1840s Elphinstone was known as Sawpit Gully and was renamed in the early 1800s. Built and first commercially licensed by Sarah Fyans in 1871. In 1875 Sarah Fyans married Friedrick Richard Lonsdale and the licence transferred to him until his death in 1889. Sarah Lonsdale owned the hotel until approximately 1905 when it was purchased by Newman & Co. Members of Sarah‚Äôs family ran the hotel until 1921, (50 years) except for 4 ¬Ω years when it was leased to Joseph Archer. In 1922 a public telephone and exchange were located there as well as a store, which operated from the present day lounge until the 1960s, when it was moved to the newly built Elphinstone Post Office. Before refrigeration, the hotel cellar was used to store the bodies of deceased locals before burial. Inquests were also held at the hotel. From the 1920s to the 1950s publicans struggled to make a living from the hotel and by 1955 the hotel was literally falling down. When the Victorian Licensing Board threatened to revoke the licence a group of local graziers (Jim Barty, Alf Fletcher, Alan Finning, Ringan Oliver, Ian MacRae and Louis Smith), fearing the town would die if the hotel closed, pooled 500 pounds each to purchase the freehold and renovate the hotel. Description The Elphinstone Hotel is a large building (approx. 480 sq. metres) and has the appearance of a mid 1900s hotel even though it was built in the 1860s. Major renovations in 1956 have changed the building‚Äôs form to a corrugated iron, wide hipped roof adorned by two 1950s style chimneys. A straight, pitched veranda, (3 x 23 metres) at the front is slung from below the roofline. The veranda has no decoration and is supported by plain timber posts on concrete stumps. The original old brick walls are now clad in stippled concrete and painted cream. The timber sash windows and French style double glass doors to the bar and rear entrance, were obviously replaced during the 1950s renovations . Although much has changed, the hotel has many original features including the underground blue stone cellar which may even pre-date the building of the original brick hotel. The hotel sits on a large triangular allotment (approx. 75 x 40 x 86 metres), which is surrounded by a dark green Colorbond fence. Many old hand made bricks were uncovered during the construction of the fence, possibly the chimney remains of the Freemason‚Äôs Tavern which burnt down in 1879. An old iron and red gum shedding which sat on the southern fence line of the property was rebuilt in 2016 to the same original design and style. The small paddock on the south eastern corner of the property is used by the hotel as a customer Horse Paddock for those who ride horses to the hotel. Situated next to the Swan Hill railway line, the hotel along with the historic Elphinstone Railway Station, Bateman‚Äôs Garage and the war memorial form an historic triangle of the township.

In 1622, Elizabeth produced The Countess of Lincoln's Nursery, an advisory pamphlet which was dedicated to her daughter-in-law, Bridget.

In 1995 he moved to London, where he has lived ever since. He started his career at Sotheby‚Äôs Billingshurst in 1996 and transferred in 1997 to Bond Street in London, working first in the impressionist and contemporary art departments, before moving into the furniture department. At age 28 he became Deputy Director at Sotheby's and at 31 a director and head of continental furniture, specialising in 18th century French furniture.

The membership comprises mostly orthopaedic surgeons along with sports scientists, sports physicians and sports physical therapists. The members are from some 92 different countries and are members of their local orthopaedic sports medicine societies or similar associations. Members may also be associated with their global regional orthopaedic sports medicine society such as the Arthroscopy Association of North America (AANA), the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM), the Asia-Pacific Knee, Arthroscopy and Sports Medicine Society (APKASS), the European Society for Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery and Arthroscopy (ESSKA) and the Sociedad Latinoamericana de Artroscopia, Rodilla y Deporte (SLARD) in particular. The purpose of ISAKOS is to act as an umbrella association for these regional societies to provide a means for exchange of knowledge between them and, most importantly, to promote education in the fields of knee surgery and orthopaedic sports medicine to those areas of the world where such educational opportunities are lacking. ISAKOS achieves these goals by the involvement of members in educational meetings, sponsoring of visitations by surgeons from poorer countries to centres of excellence along with other awards, scholarships and endorsements of regional meetings. Arthroscopy (also called arthroscopic surgery) is a minimally invasive surgical procedure on a joint in which a treatment or just an examination is performed using an arthroscope, an endoscope that is inserted into the joint through a small incision. Sports medicine, also known as sport and exercise medicine (SEM), is a part of medicine that deals with the prevention and treatment of injuries related to sports and exercise. History ISAKOS was formed in 1995, in Hong Kong, at the combined congress of the International Arthroscopy Association (IAA) and the International Society of the Knee (ISK). These two societies previously held meetings ‚Äòback to back‚Äô and as most delegates attended both it became a logical step to combine them. ISAKOS is the union of these International societies (IAA and ISK). ISAKOS holds an international Congress every two years. Since the founding in 1995, these Congress meetings have been held throughout the world. The first president of ISAKOS was Dr. Peter J. Fowler of Canada, in the years 1995 to 1997. For the 2015-17 term, the society was chaired by Dr. Philippe Neyret of France, followed by Dr Marc Safran of the USA from 2017-19. The society is currently chiared by Dr. Willem van der Merwe of South Africa, who will hold the post until 2021. Membership ISAKOS is a truly international society of individuals interested in Sports Orthopaedics and the fields of medicine and science related to that. These include knee surgery, arthroscopic surgery of all joints and orthopaedic sports medicine. It is very common for those applying for membership to also be a member of one of the major regional Associations. These are the Arthroscopy Association of North America (AANA), the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM), the Asia-Pacific Knee, Arthroscopy and Sports Medicine Society (APKASS), the European Society for Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery and Arthroscopy (ESSKA) and the Sociedad Latinoamericana de Artroscopia, Rodilla y Deporte (SLARD). Members are also members of their regional or National orthopaedic sports medicine society (or equivalent). Indeed, members of these Associations may gain Associate Membership of ISAKOS immediately on application. There are two primary membership categories: Associate members Those with an interest or ability in the fields of medicine or science with an interest in arthroscopy, knee surgery, and orthopaedic sports medicine shall be eligible. These members are not entitled to vote and are not eligible to hold office. Active Members Individuals qualified as orthopaedic surgeons, musculoskeletal surgeons, rheumatologists or the equivalent in their home countries and who are in good medical standing in their national or regional association as determined by the membership committee of the ISAKOS. Active members are entitled to vote at all meetings of the membership and are eligible to hold office in the society. Active Membership is awarded pending an application review at a meeting of the Membership Committee. The Membership Committee meets at all annual AAOS meetings and at ISAKOS congresses. Awards In order to promote excellence in research and to reward those who have worked for the benefit of the Society, ISAKOS offers a number of awards. These awards are for original papers in the various categories which are submitted for the biennial Congress. The awards are presented at the Congress and notified in the Society Newsletter and on the ISAKOS website. Many of the Awards honour prominent present and past ISAKOS members and past notable doyens of sports surgery while others offer financial support for research, Fellowships and attendance at various ISAKOS sponsored meetings. In keeping with the fundamental mission of ISAKOS some preference is given to supporting research and scholarships to individuals from countries where such opportunities may not have otherwise been available. These awards include; Awards * John J. Joyce Award - For the best arthroscopy paper * Richard B. Caspari Award - For the best upper extremity paper * Jan I. Gillquist Scientific Award - For the best scientific research * Gary G. Poehling Award Award - For the best elbow, wrist and hand paper * Albert Trillat Young Investigator‚Äôs Award - For the best young clinical researcher * Achilles Orthopaedic Sports Medicine Research Award - For the best Sports Medicine research * Paolo Aglietti Award - For the best Knee Arthroplasty research * The Patellofemoral Research Excellence Award - For the best Patellofemoral Research Fellowships and Scholarships * ISAKOS Global Traveling Fellowship * The Patellofemoral Traveling Fellowship * International Sports Medicine Fellows Conference Scholarship * Teaching Centre Scholarship * ISAKOS Clinical Funded Research Session * ISAKOS Young Investigator's Scholarship & Research Mentoring Program Applications for these Awards and Scholarships are usually invited a year before the Biennial Congress.  Educational Activities  The primary focus of ISAKOS is education in the fields of Orthopaedic Sports Medicine, Arthroscopy and Knee Surgery. It achieves this goal by 4 means; the Biennial ISAKOS Congress, focussed expert consensus meetings resulting in a publication, instructional courses and surgical techniques available on the ISAKOS website and involvement with approval of many other courses with similar educational intent throughout the world. ISAKOS also allows branding of Fellowship programs and financially supports specific educational Travelling Fellowships. The Biennial Congress. This is the most important event in the ISAKOS calendar and much activity centres on the planning and organisation of this International Congress. Many of the ISAKOS Committees have input into the structure, format and content of the Congress with the oversight of the Program Committee and the Program Chair. The Congress is a forum for free papers and abstracts are required usually 12 months in advance. There is strong competition for acceptance of papers for podium presentation and this ensures the quality of the program. In addition, the Congress also includes Instructional Courses on specific topics led by International experts along with Symposia on topics of current interest. In recent years the Congress has expanded to include live surgical demonstrations and ‚ÄòHands on Workshops‚Äô. Poster presentations are now presented electronically and delegates receive an electronic copy of these with their registration. More recently the Congress has also made available a dedicated app which allows delegates to preview abstracts and plan their involvement at the Congress. The Congress also includes sessions for debates on current issues, technical exhibits and time for networking which is so important in developing International professional contacts and acquaintances. The biennial ISAKOS Congress is considered to be one of the premier international orthopaedic society meetings. It provides a unique opportunity for attendees to share, discuss and learn the latest advancements in arthroscopy, knee surgery and sports medicine. The Meeting is usually held for a total of 5 days, during the months of May or June. Several ISAKOS Awards for outstanding clinical or laboratory research are presented during this meeting. The most recent ISAKOS meeting was held in 2017 in Shanghai, China, and involved over 4000 attendees from 84 countries presenting 256 papers and 753 E-posters. ISAKOS also supports and collaborates on several other meetings throughout the year focusing on knee injuries or other sports related areas of interest. In addition, the Society provides accreditation for numerous other educational courses all over the world. Focussed Expert Consensus Meetings. The Clinical Committees of ISAKOS are made up of multinational members with common interests. This provides an ideal forum for discussion and often resolution of many issues relevant to that speciality. Often the Committee will convene a meeting to resolve a specific issue or discuss a specific topic. Experts from around the world, whether ISAKOS members or not, are invited to these meetings and a consensus is usually developed. These consensus meetings usually result in a publication on the topic. Such international consensus on a controversial topic is a much more considered resolution of an issue than the opinions of a single expert. A number of ISAKOS derived publications of the outcomes of consensus meetings are available to members, many of which have been published in respected orthopaedic literature. Instructional Course Lectures and Surgical Technique Videos. Through the ISAKOS website and the Global link members are able to view many Instructional videos on current topics. Surgical technique videos are also available. Many of these have been recorded during previous Congress sessions and others have been supplied by individual surgeons for the benefit of ISAKOS members. ISAKOS Approved Meetings. Regional societies have their local meetings attracting their members and other delegates from locally or from other countries. These local societies can apply to ISAKOS for approval of their program. This is determined by the Scientific Committee and if approval is granted then this can be advertised by the regional society. The expectation is that such approval offers a degree of enhanced credibility to the scientific nature of the approved meeting.

His intimacy with Alcibiades had first arisen upon an occasion mentioned by the writer Plutarch, who tells us that Alcibiades in one of his first appearances in the popular assembly allowed a tame quail to escape from under his cloak, which occurrence suspended the business of the assembly, till it was caught by Antiochus and given to Alcibiades.Plutarch, Alcibiades 10 Antiochus gave no heed to the injunctions of Alcibiades, and provoked Lysander to an engagement in what came to be known as the Battle of Notium, in which fifteen Athenian ships were lost, and Antiochus himself was killed. This defeat was a small but symbolic victory for the Spartans, and one of the main causes that led to the second banishment of Alcibiades.

During the time of the Penal Laws, Catholic religious observances were suppressed, and these remote sites were used as secret places of worship. Mass gardens The survey records a Mass garden at Lisglasson in Clontibret, and a Mass garden (or hut) at Doohamlet. The Mass garden at Lisglasson is situated close to the N2 and is accessible from the roadside. It is highlighted on the 1857 Ordnance Survey map of the Clontibret/Lisglasson area and in √ì Gallachair's 1957 journal article. Mass rocks The survey records a Mass rock at Lemgare, a Mass rock at Tasson, and a rock or hut at Dunfelimy near Annyalla. The site at Dunfelimy is mentioned, by Rev. O'Gallachair, as being a Mass rock \\"on the site of old church of Annyalla\\". In making this reference, O'Gallachair is picking up a point made over thirty years earlier by Fr James E McKenna in his Parishes of Clogher, Vol. I (Enniskillen, 1920, p. 527). The opinion is that there may be a mix up between a Mass rock in Dunfelimy and perhaps a structure (usually a hut called a both√≥g) which predated the old chapel at Annyalla and which was built in the late 1790s.

The group has examined the roots of traditional beekeeping and found that individual farms tended to keep only a few hives each‚Äîin contrast with today's commercial beekeeping model, in which a single apiary consists of hundreds of hives. The founders believe that this practice is the cause of the pollinator decline. The IHAB was created to imitate the old beekeeping model and allow a more even distribution of bees.  History  In 2013, IHAB introduced their first development of a top bar hive. The product was designed to make it easier and more convenient for an average person to raise bees. The top bar hive has the convenience of being usable in backyards or on city terraces. In 2015, IHAB, Norwegian urban beekeeping group ByBi, and New York City Beekeepers Association set up the first intercontinental hobby beekeepers' network.

He is also one of the most popular streamers among the community. Born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, Babaev showed much promise as a youngster, reached the highest matchmaking rating leaderboards in public matches. In April 2013, he made his professional debut in MLG Columbus as a stand-in for Speed Gaming. In January 2014, Babaev, along with North American Dota players Universe and Fear, as well as former Heroes of Newerth players ppd and zai created S A D B O Y S, who were later signed by Evil Geniuses.  History = 2013: Early career = On November 22, 2013, Arteezy had the opportunity to stand in for bOne7, who was unable to attend due to visa issues, and play for his previous team Speed Gaming (formerly Kaipi) at MLG Columbus. Arteezy handily defeated several more well-established midlaners, including Mushi and Dendi, en route to an underdog victory for Speed Gaming over the all-star Team DK in the finals. = 2014: Birth of Evil Geniuses = On January 31, 2014, Arteezy, along with Dota 2 veterans UNiVeRsE and Fear, as well as former Heroes of Newerth players ppd and zai, created S A D B O Y S, which had immediate success. The team won 16 out of their first 18 matches, including winning the Electronic Sports Prime/Shock Therapy Cup while going undefeated. On February 21, 2014, Arteezy and company were announced to be the new Evil Geniuses Dota 2 squad, which continued to be a top-tier team despite being from the weaker North American scene. On March 7, 2014, the new EG attended their first LAN tournament at the Monster Energy Invitational, where they won 3‚Äì2 against Cloud9 in the finals. With this victory, the team firmly established their reputation as one of the best Dota 2 teams in the world, due in no small part to Arteezy's individual skill. On April 29, 2014, Evil Geniuses were directly invited to compete in The International 2014 Dota 2 Championships. With top 3 finishes at three of the four major LANs prior to TI4, including a first-place finish at The Summit 1 over Team DK, EG was one of the favorites to win the biggest Dota 2 tournament of the year. EG was not as successful as the Chinese Dota 2 teams in adapting to the more aggressive play-style at TI4 but still ended with a 3rd-place finish, taking home US$1,038,416. = 2015: Joined Team Secret = After some internal issues with EG, Arteezy left the team and joined Team Secret in December 2014. With Arteezy transitioning to the carry position, Team Secret stormed through The Summit 3, Mars Dota League 2015 and ESL One Frankfurt 2015 taking 1st place at each, establishing themselves as the favorites for The International 2015. Team Secret ultimately finished 7‚Äì8th place at TI5. Following this result, in August he rejoined Evil Geniuses as the carry, with SumaiL continuing in the mid-lane position. This new Evil Geniuses roster finished in third place in Frankfurt Major 2015 despite a strong showing early in the tournament, losing to the eventual winners of the tournament, OG. = 2016: Highest ranked player = EG again finished third at the Shanghai Major 2016 and second at Dota Pit Season 4. On March 22, 2016, Arteezy and teammate Saahil Arora, better known as Universe, left the team to join Team Secret. Universe later re-joined EG before TI6, while Arteezy remained on Team Secret. In September, Babaev left Secret during the post-TI shuffle, returning to Evil Geniuses once again with former Team OG player Cr1t. In July 2016, Arteezy became the second player in Dota 2 history to reach 9,000 Matchmaking Rating (MMR) in online matchmaking. The first player to reach this rating was Team Liquid player Miracle-. = 2017: The Manila Masters champion = Evil Geniuses managed to get first place in The Manila Masters tournament, winning the first prize of $125,000. Later on The International 2017 tournament, despite being one of the directly invited teams, EG finished 9th-12th in the tournament. This led to the departure of position 4 player Zai, who was replaced by former team coach Fear. As of October 9, Arteezy is still an active member of the roster playing the carry role. = 2018: The International 2018 = On July 27, 2018, Evil Geniuses won North America in-house tournament Summit 9 organized by Beyond The Summit.

It widened the definition of sabotage to include strikes, trade union activity, and writing slogans on walls. The maximum penalty for sabotage was hanging and the minimum five years' imprisonment. It reversed the normal burden of proof so that the accused were assumed to be guilty and had to prove their innocence. Publications opposing the government were liable to a fine of R20,000. The Act extended the powers of the Minister of Justice, a post held in 1962 by B. J. Vorster, to ban people and organisations. Anyone who had been charged under the Suppression of Communism Act, 1950 could be banned from holding office in named institutions. Such people became known as \\"statutory Communists\\" - even if they had never actually been members of the South African Communist Party. They could be put under house arrest without trial, made to report daily to the police and be prohibited from attending social gatherings.

The Appiani (also Appiano or d'Appiano) is an Italian noble family, originally from Al Piano or Appiano, a now disappeared toponym identified with the modern La Pieve in the comune of Ponsacco. They held the principality of Piombino from the early 15th century until 1628. History The first known member is one Guarnito d'Appiano, a notary who lived between 1200 and 1255; his son Jacopo (flourished at Pisa c. 1230-1290) was also a notary, as well as his grandson Benvenuto, who became chief of the Pisane Corporation of Notaries. His grand-grandson Vanni, also a notary, became an Anziano (\\"Elder\\", meaning consul) of Pisa and then Chancellor of the Senate of Lucca in 1347, before he was beheaded at Pisa in May 1355. His son Jacopo (c. 1322 - 1398) became Chancellor of the Republic of Pisa and head of the political party of the Raspanti, associated with the Della Gherardesca family. In 1392, after assassinating Pietro Gambacorti and his sons, he became effective lord of Pisa. He was succeeded by his son Gherardo (c. 1370-1405) in 1398, who, one year later, ceded the seigniory of Pisa to Gian Galeazzo Visconti, lord of Milan; when the latter died, Pisa was sold to Florence by Gabriele Maria Visconti, while the Appiani retained the lordship of Piombino, Suvereto, Buriano, Scarlino, Vignale, Populonia, Elba, Pianosa and Montecristo. Gherardo was succeeded by his son Iacopo II in 1404; at his death (1441), his mother and regent Paola Colonna clashed against Emanuele Appiani for Piombino. Paola Colonna died in 1445, and the rule went to Caterina, Iacopo II's sister, although the effective rule was held by her husband Rinaldo Orsini. Rinaldo died of plague in 1450 and Caterina in 1451, after which Emanuele was elected lord of Piombino by the population. In 1509 Iacopo IV was accorded the title of Prince of Piombino by emperor Maximilian of Habsburg. His son Iacopo V married two sisters of the two Medici popes Leo X and Clement VII and, after they had both died, a descendant of Lorenzo de' Medici. However, his son Iacopo VI was ousted from Piombino in 1548 by emperor Charles V, who assigned his lands to Cosimo I, Duke of Tuscany. Iacopo was restored in 1559, though three years later a popular revolt forced him to fight in the Tuscan navy, leaving his son Alessandro as governor. Alessandro was able to obtain the imperial legitimation, but was killed by the populace in 1589 after four years of reign. Iacopo VII succeeded him, obtaining from emperor Rudolf II the title of prince. After Iacopo died heirless in 1603, Piombino went to a cousin, but the principality was actually held by Isabella Appiani until 1628, when she was ousted; finally, in 1634 emperor Ferdinand II assigned Piombino to Niccol√≤ Ludovisi, who married a daughter of Isabella.

It was released on 15 January 2016 through Island Records. The EP has charted in Canada. Banners includes three songs that were released as singles throughout 2015 ‚Äì \\"Ghosts\\", \\"Shine a Light\\" and \\"Start a Riot\\" ‚Äì as well as two new tracks, \\"Gold Dust\\" and\\" \\"Back When We Had Nothing\\". Composition The EP's first track, \\"Start a Riot\\", is a \\"soaring pop track,\\" an \\"emotional, sensitive and melodically organic indie rock\\" song. It opens with electronic, echoing backing vocals and a simple piano line. Banners' falsetto vocals emerge in the chorus and \\"the heart of the song is exposed.\\" The lyrics are personal and serve as an ode to a loved one, describing the lengths to which the narrator would go for them. \\"Shine a Light\\" is an uplifting anthem, a \\"piano ballad turned stadium epic.\\" It starts with \\"chunky\\" piano chords and features \\"thundering\\" drums, with Banners' falsetto vocals piercing through. Towards the end of the track, lead guitar escalates to \\"full-on\\" stadium rock. Lyrically, the song is about being lost at sea and searching for a \\"beacon of light,\\" a \\"glimmer of hope that brings you through the storm.\\" Banners said in interviews that \\"it's a song to the person in your life that offers salvation while the storm is raging around you,\\" and that he was away from home and feeling lonely when he was writing the song. The fourth track on the EP, \\"Ghosts\\", is a \\"haunting piano ballad\\", which starts slowly, with a few piano chords that match the vocals. After one minute, kick drum and strings enter and the songs starts building momentum at the 2:22 mark. According to Banners, the song is about his dreams and nightmares. \\"It's about having someone to fight the world with. It's about love and loss, but also the idea that these feelings don't stop just because a relationship does\\". Promotion The first single from the EP, \\"Ghosts\\", was originally released in March 2015 under the stage name Raines. A music video for the song was directed by Christopher Ranson. The second single from the EP, \\"Shine a Light\\", was released in August 2015. The song appeared on the soundtrack for the FIFA 16 video game.

Early life The youngest son of Thomas Boston (1676‚Äì1732), he was born at Ettrick on 3 April 1713. After some home instruction, he went to the grammar school at Hawick, and then to Edinburgh University. Boston was licensed on 1 August 1732 by the Selkirk presbytery, presented to Ettrick in place of his father in November 1732, and ordained there on 4 April 1733. On 25 October 1748 he was released from the charge, having a call to Oxnam, Roxburghshire; and was admitted there on 10 August 1749. The \\"relief\\" presbytery Popular as the heir to his father's theology of the Marrow Controversy, Boston was the immediate cause of a rift in the parish church of the neighbouring town of Jedburgh. When a vacancy there was filled over the wishes of the congregation, the elders of the church and most of the parishioners, including the town council, withdrew from the church and built a meeting-house for Boston. John Bonar, who had been appointed to Jedburgh, did not take up the post.s:Bonar, John (1722-1761) (DNB00) Boston tendered his demission to the presbytery on 7 December 1757. On 30 May 1758 the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland accepted his demission, and in doing so declared him henceforth incapable of receiving a presentation; and prohibited all ministers from employing him in any office. Boston then continued his ministry at Jedburgh as an Independent. In 1761 he and Thomas Gillespie joined in admitting Thomas Colier as minister to a congregation at Colinsburgh. The three constituted themselves into a new body, the \\"Presbytery of Relief\\". Boston was its first moderator. In 1765 he went to Glasgow, on trial as a minister to a Relief congregation there, but was not called. The new organisation, which became the Relief Church, initially did not consider itself opposed to the Church of Scotland. In 1773, six years after Boston's death, the relief presbytery formed itself into a \\"Synod of Relief\\". Death and family Boston died at Jedburgh on 13 February 1767. He had married on 26 April 1738 Elizabeth Anderson, who died at Dysart on 21 June 1787. His son Michael was minister of the relief congregation at Falkirk; his daughter Christiana, married Dr. Tucker Harris, of Charlestown, South Carolina. Works Boston's publications consisted of four single sermons, of which the first was printed in 1745, the last in 1762. His Select Discourses on a variety of practical subjects, Glasgow, 1768, were issued posthumously. Some of these are in Select Sermons by Boston and James Baine, with introductory essay by Neil McMichael, Edinburgh 1850.

The tree species is said to be one of the best varieties in the world. History Initially, sandalwood oil was extracted in India by crude methods. Before World War I, sandalwood from the Mysore district was distilled in Germany and sold there. However, when World War I broke out in 1914, this route of extraction had to be closed down, resulting in a loss of revenue to the exchequer. In 1916-17, the sandalwood oil distillery was established in Mysore by the then Mysore government (now the Karnataka government) to distil oil from sandalwood. In 1977, the Mysore district had about 85,000 sandalwood trees, and production reported during 1985-86 was about of raw sandalwood. To preserve its importance to the economy, according to the Government Gazetteer, the government introduced special laws and regulations. In the erstwhile princely state of Mysore (part of Karnataka since independence), sandal was a \\"royal tree\\", with the state government controlling it. This oil has been registered for protection under the geographical indication of the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement. In 2006, it was listed as \\"Mysore Sandalwood Oil\\" under the GI Act 1999 of the Government of India, with registration confirmed by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks. Uses The heartwood or the trunk of the sandalwood tree and also its roots are used in the oil extraction process. The oil is used in the manufacture of soaps, incense, scents, and cosmetics; it also has several uses in religious rites, skin and hair therapeutic treatments, and in pharmaceuticals. There are many varieties of sandalwood oil, and Mysore sandalwood oil was considered one of the best in 1938. The sandalwood oil produced in Mysore accounted for 70% of the world's sandalwood production in 1996. It is used as a \\"blender fixative\\" in the blending of many popular perfumes in the world. in 1942 it was assessed as having an assured minimum of 90% santalol, and of comparable standard to any sandalwood oil produced elsewhere. According to Swami Vivekananda, Mysore was identified with sandalwood, which was integral to the religious, social and ceremonial life of the east. Vivekananda said \\"the lingering perfume of this wood may be truly said to have made its conquest of the world\\". The heartwood of the tree, which is not affected by insects, has been used to fashion furniture and temple structures in India. Its oil has been considered an aphrodisiac, as its aroma has similarity with androsterone, a male hormone. In Ayurvedic medicine, sandalwood is used to combat urinary tract infections, prostate dysfunction, diarrhea, earache, and lung infections. Practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine use it to treat cholera, gonorrhea, and abdominal pain.

Biography Havelock was born on 14 April 1912 in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. His father was killed in World War I during the Battle of the Somme, and after his mother remarried, the family moved to East Africa when he was eight years old. After starting at the Kenya Grange School in Lumbwa, he was later sent to Imperial Service College. In 1929 he returned to Kenya and began working at a timber yard, before becoming manager of a Royal Dutch Shell depot in Nakuru. After starting an unsuccessful garage business, he moved into the fishing industry on Lake Victoria; this too was not a success, and after the boat blew up, he started selling milk in the Kakamega gold fields, buying eucalyptus trees to use for pit props and also became a prospector. However, he also discovered that his partner in the fishing business had run off and left him with a debt of ¬£800, which he spent the next eight years paying off. In 1938 he married Muriel Pershouse, with whom he had a son. He then moved into the civil service, becoming the senior officer in Nairobi jail. When World War II began he was appointed secretary to the Kenya Defence Forces tribunal, also holding the position of assistant to the Director of Manpower. He later joined the Kenya Regiment, seeing action in Abyssinia with the King's African Rifles. However, after suffering from dysentery, he was sent back to Kenya, and began running a training school. After the war he bought a dairy and pyrethrum farm in Limuru. He moved into raising Jersey cattle and then bought a coffee farm. His move into politics started after he became the unofficial election agent for Olga Watkins, the Member of the Legislative Council for Kiambu. She died in 1948, and Havelock won the by-election to become an MLC.Kenya Gazette, 17 February 1948 He retained the seat in the May 1948 general elections, in which he was returned unopposed. Initially a right-wing firebrand, he later realised that African nationalism had to be accommodated. He became the chairman of the elected members in 1950,Dickson A. Mungazi (1999) The Last British Liberals in Africa: Michael Blundell and Garfield Todd, Greenwood Publishing Group, p220 and was also returned unopposed in the 1952 elections. He was appointed Minister of Local Government in 1954, and was narrowly re-elected in 1956 when he beat his opponent Richard Thompson by 23 votes. He subsequently joined the New Kenya Group, Kenya's first multi-racial political party. He was re-elected again in the 1961 elections, and the following year he was appointed Minister of Agriculture, a position he held until 1963. He was knighted in 1963, and after independence, he was a member of the Coastal Regional Assembly until it was abolished. He later worked for the agricultural finance corporation, and acquired a number of hotels. After divorcing, he married Patricia Mumford in 1972. Sir Wilfrid Havelock died on 6 April 2003 in Nairobi.

The ruins include major archaeological sites such as Sechin Bajo, Sechin Alto, Cerro Sechin, Mojeque (Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke), Chankillo, and Taukachi-Konkan, as well as other smaller sites. Most of these inland sites are found in the river valleys about distant from the ocean. The seaside sites of Huaynun√° and Las Haldas are found about north and south of the mouth of the Casma River on the coast. A frieze located at Sechin Bajo dated at 3600 BCE is the oldest example of monumental architecture discovered thus far in the Americas. This date, if confirmed by additional discoveries, means that the Casma/Sechin culture may have originated as early or earlier than Norte Chico, currently considered the oldest civilization of the Americas.\\"Oldest Urban Site in the Americas Found, Experts Claim\\", National Geographic News, Feb 26, 2008, , accessed 20 Jan 2016 Environment The Peruvian Pacific coast is one of the driest deserts in the world with average annual precipitation of less than .

Downloaded from Project Muse. The Casma and Sechin river valleys have, in more recent times, supported a population of 14,000 people and perhaps the population during the height of the Casma/Sechin culture was similar.Mosele, Michael E. (2001), The Incas and their Ancestors, New York: Thames & Hudson, p. 143 However, another estimate is that the number of people associated with the culture was 23,000.Pozorski, Thomas and Pozorski, Shelia (Summer 2005), \\"Architecture and Chronology at the Site of Sechin Alto, Casma Valley, Peru,\\" Journal of Field Archaeology, Vol. 30, No. 2, p. 158 The amount of irrigable land is the narrow valleys is not large, although some population lived outside the agricultural area in the coastal sites. The waters of the Pacific Ocean off Peru are extremely rich and some of the earliest settlements were on the desert coast and depended upon fishing rather than agriculture or hunting and gathering for subsistence. The earliest settlements also developed in the pre-ceramic era and did not use pottery.Moore, pp. 219‚Äì220 The Casma/Sechin culture was located about north of the northern outposts of the Norte Chico civilization, believed by archaeologists to be the oldest in the Americas. Given the short distances contact and transmission of cultural traits between the two areas was likely.Moore, pp 236‚Äì237 Description Coastal Peru is one of six areas of the world in which civilization developed independently without outside influences.\\"Rise of Civilizations: Mesopotamia to Mesoamerica\\", Archaeology, Wright, Henry T., vol. 42, no. 1, pp. 46‚Äì48, 96‚Äì100, 1990 By 3000 BC, at a few locations in coastal Peru, including the Casma/Sechin valleys, a sizable population was present and undertaking large projects such as building pyramids and other ceremonial and monumental structures. The earliest Peruvian civilization differed from the other five pristine civilizations in that it lacked ceramics (pottery) in its initial stages. The importance of agriculture to early Peruvian civilization is debated with some archaeologists proposing a \\"maritime hypothesis\\" in which the rich maritime resources of the nearby Pacific Ocean enabled sedentary coastal societies to flourish before irrigated agriculture was used.Moore, pp. 219‚Äì220 Some artifacts of the Casma/Sechin culture may predate the Norte Chico civilization. Radiocarbon dating indicates a plaza at Sechin Bajo was constructed in 3500 BCE. A nearby 2 meter-tall (2 yards) frieze was dated at 3600 BCE.Whalen, Andrew, (2008), \\"Ancient ceremonial plaza found in Peru\\", Associated Press, The plaza and the frieze are the two oldest examples of monumental architecture discovered thus far in the Americas.\\"Oldest Urban Site in the Americas Found, Experts Claim\\", National Geographic News, Feb 26, 2008, , accessed 20 Jan 2016 Lithic Period (12000 ‚Äì 3000 BCE). The earliest radio carbon dating of human occupation in the Casma/Sechin valley is near the ruin of Cerro Sechin and dates to 7600 BC. Sechin Bajo has the earliest remains discovered of monumental architecture with ruins of the \\"First Building\\" dated from 3700 BC to 2900 BC during which time multiple reconstructions of the building were undertaken. The location of Sechin Bajo inland from the sea and from marine resources suggests that agriculture had become a significant contributor to the livelihood of the builders and nearby occupants. The labor requirement for construction also implies a numerous sedentary or semi- sedentary population nearby with a mechanism of control to gather and supervise workers. Pottery was not in use during this period.Moore, pp. 230‚Äì231 Preceramic Period (3000 ‚Äì 1800 BCE) (2500 ‚Äì 1800 BCE is called the Cotton Preceramic Period or Preceramic Period VI). The Preceramic Period is characterized by the growth of the coastal settlements of Huaynun√°, with a settlement dated as old as 2900 BCE, and Las Haldas where a settlement is dated back to 2200 BCE.Moore, p. 229; Pozorski, Shelia and Pozorski, Thomas (2006b), \\"Las Haldas: An Expanding Initial Period Polity of Coastal Peru,\\" Journal of Anthropological Research, Vol. 62, No. 1, p. 30. Downloaded from JSTOR Both Huaynun√° and Las Haldas are located more than distant from the irrigable lands of the Casma River Valley and thus fishing was their principal means of subsistence.Moore, p. 229; Pozorski, (2006b), pp 20‚Äì35. Inland sites also grew during this period with the coastal settlements providing fish and other marine resources to interior settlements and the interior settlements providing agricultural products to the coastal settlements. Particularly important in this trade was cotton which was used by the coastal settlements for fishing nets and lines and gourds used for floats and containers. Floodplain agriculture seems to have been the most common means of raising crops although small-scale canal irrigation was probably also used in the Casma and Sechin valleys during this time.Pozorski (2006a), p. 113 Initial Period (1800 ‚Äì 900 BCE) (Also called Formative Period). During the Initial Period, the Casma/Sechin culture achieved its most prominence. Technological developments included woven textiles and pottery, the adoption or expansion of canal irrigation for agriculture in the river valleys, and the construction of many large monumental pyramids and plazas.Pozorski, (2006a) p. 114-117 Many of the prominent sites of the Initial Period, such as Sechin Bajo and Cerro Sechin, date back to the Preceramic Period, but they were reconstructed and expanded during this time span.Moore, pp 231‚Äì235 The concentration of monumental constructions in the Sechin Valley during this period is remarkable. Within a distance of about in the Sechin valley are four large ruins: Sechin Bajo, Taukachi-Konkan, Cerro Sechin, and Sechin Alto. Sechin Alto was dominant, the largest of the flat-topped pyramids characteristic of the Peruvian coast, a mound in length and width and in height. This was the largest construction in the Americas when it was built from about 1600 to 1400 BCE.Moore, 235‚Äì236 The size, concentration, and uniformity of monuments in the Sechin valley has led archaeologists to suggest that Sechin Alto was the administrative center of a polity which united the valleys and possibly coastal sites under one government. The dominance of Sechin Alto is also suggested because of its location. All the other major sites are located in the desert at the edge of the irrigable area; Sechin Alto, in a display of conspicuous consumption, occupies scarce irrigable land.Pozorski, Thomas and Pozorski, Shelia, \\"Preceramic and Initial Period Monumentality within the Casma Valley of Peru,\\" in Burger, Richard L. and Rosenswig, Robert M.

Many industrial and food plants were cultivated by the inhabitants of the Casma and Sechin Valleys, but evidence of maize, the most important crop of the Americas, is absent during the Initial Period and earlier.Pozorski (2012), pp 388‚Äì389 Early Horizon (900 ‚Äì 200 BCE) (Also called Formative Period). The culture of the Casma and Sechin river valleys came under the influence, and possibly the political control, of the highland Chavin culture during the Early Horizon. Near the end of the Initial Period, the character of the architecture, artifacts, and food changed in the Casma/Sechin area which implies a \\"hostile invasion.\\" Maize and domestic animals, llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs, were introduced during the Early Horizon period and the dependence upon marine resources for protein declined, suggesting that the invaders (if such there were) came from the highlands of Peru rather than other coastal cultures. Military themes were much more prominent in the new style of architecture. The large mounds characterizing Initial Period culture were no longer built.Pozorski (2006a), pp. 118‚Äì130 Chankillo is one of the Early Horizon ruins of most interest. Dating from as early as 350 BCE, Chankillo incorporated a fortress, a solar observatory, and ceremonial areas. The observatory, called the Thirteen Towers of Chankillo, permitted an observer to determine a precise date of the year by observing the position of the sun at sunrise and sunset on the towers. Chankillo and other structures of the Casma/Sechin culture were partially destroyed and their use abandoned in an apparent conflict about 100 BCE.UNESCO and World Heritage Center, \\"Case Study 3.3: Chankillo, Peru\\" ww2.astronomicalheritage.org/images/astronomicalheritage.org/thematic- study/ch03cs3.pdf, accessed 6 Feb 2016 See also *Cerro Sechin *Chankillo *Las Haldas *Mojeque (Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke) *Sechin Alto *Sechin Bajo References Category:Archaeological sites in Peru Category:Tourist attractions in Ancash Region Category:Archaeological sites in Ancash Region Category:Andean preceramic Category:Andean civilizations Category:Pre- Columbian cultures Category:History of Peru Category:Archaeology of Peru ","title":"Casma‚ÄìSechin culture"},{"id":"49226844","text":"In Our Own Way () is a 2013 documentary written, directed and produced by Italian director , telling a story of five women and their relationship with men.

Life He was born at St. George's Tombland in Norwich on 25 October 1756, eldest son of Edward Pearson (d. 1786) a wool-stapler there, who shortly moved to Tattingstone, Suffolk and was governor of the local poorhouse. He was educated at home, and entered Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge as sizar, on 7 May 1778. The Rev. John Hey, the college tutor, who held the rectory of Passenham, Northamptonshire, appointed him his curate (26 April 1781). Pearson was ordained by John Hinchliffe, the Bishop of Peterborough, on 26 June 1781; he graduated B.A. in 1782, M.A. 1785, and B.D. 1792, and was elected Fellow of his college. Early in 1788 he became tutor of Sidney Sussex College, and took on the curacy of Pampisford, about seven miles from Cambridge. He had previously held curacies not only at Passenham, but then also at Cosgrove, and at Strutton. In 1796 Pearson left Cambridge to become vicar of Rempstone, Nottinghamshire, and became known as a controversialist. From a theological perspective, he was described as an \\"Arminian Champion\\". He made evangelicalism a particular target. In May 1806 Pearson proposed, in the Orthodox Churchman's Magazine, the foundation of \\"a ritual professorship in divinity\\" at Cambridge. Spencer Perceval, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, approved the scheme, and offered to guarantee the expenses for five years; but the university authorities did not adopt it. In 1807 Pearson was appointed through Perceval's influence Warburtonian lecturer at Lincoln's Inn. In 1808 Pearson was elected Master of Sidney Sussex College, and received by royal mandate the degree of D.D.; the same year he was appointed vice-chancellor of the university. He died of an apoplectic fit at his parsonage at Rempstone on 17 August 1811. A Brief Memoir of Pearson was put together from his papers, and published in 1845, by William Powell Hunt. Works In 1786 Pearson obtained the Norrisian prize for an essay on The Goodness of God as manifested in the Mission of Jesus Christ. His published works included: *Thirteen Discourses to Academic Youth, delivered at St. Mary's, Cambridge (1798) *Remarks on the Theory of Morals (1800), against William Paley. *Annotations on the Practical Part of Dr. Paley's Work (1801) *Remarks on the Controversy subsisting, or supposed to subsist, between the Arminian and Calvinistic Ministers of the Church of England (June 1802); this and other works were directed against John Overton. *Remarks on the Dangers which threaten the Established Religion, and the Means of Averting Them (1808), advocacy for Spencer Perceval's policy in church matters. *Hulsean Defence, consisting of an Essay on the Pre-existence of Christ, a Sermon on the Trinity, and a Proposal respecting the Athanasian Creed (1810), written as Christian Advocate. *Cautions to the Hearers and Readers of the Rev.

The text is classified as one of the eight Shakta Upanishads and embedded in the Krishna Yajurveda. The Upanishad is notable for glorifying the feminine as the Shakti (energy, power) and as the metaphysical Brahman principle, and extensively uses a combination of Bhakti and Vedanta terminology. Annette Wilke and Oliver Moebus state that the underlying philosophical premise of this text corresponds to Advaita Vedanta. The text is important to the Goddess traditions of Hinduism. History The author and the century in which Sarasvati-rahsya Upanishad was composed is unknown. It is a late Upanishad, likely from the late medieval period. The text was likely composed, in the same period as other Shakta Upanishads, between the 12th- and 15th-century CE. The text, along with other Shakta Upanishads, has been dated to 16th-century, according to C Mackenzie Brown ‚Äì a professor of Religion and writer of books on Hindu goddesses. Even though this text is of relatively late origin, Sarasvati as goddess is traceable to Vedic literature from the 2nd millennium BCE.Miranda Shaw (2006), Buddhist Goddesses of India, Princeton University Press, , page 235David Kinsley (1988), Hindu Goddesses: Vision of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Traditions, University of California Press, , pages 55‚Äì64Catherine Ludv√≠k (2007), Sarasvatƒ´, Riverine Goddess of Knowledge, BRILL Academic, , pages 26‚Äì43 The text has been influential in the Shaktism (Goddess) tradition of Hinduism. Many of its verses are found incorporated in later Shakti texts such as the Vakyasudha, a treatise on non-dualist Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy. This link had been a basis for dating this text to be from the 1st-millennium, by Maurice Winternitz and Louis Renou, because they credited the 8th-century Adi Shankara to have composed Balabodhani, which some scholars such as Windischmann considered to have been also titled as Vakyasudha and Drigdrishya Viveka. However, 20th-century scholarship doubts that Shankara was the actual author of several secondary works attributed to him, and thus it is unclear if Vakyasudha or this Upanishadic text existed before 8th-century CE.Paul Hacker (1995), Philology and Confrontation: Paul Hacker on Traditional and Modern Vedanta (Editor: Wilhelm Halbfass), State University of New York Press, , pages 30‚Äì32, 42‚Äì43GC Pande (2011), Life and Thought of ≈öa·πÖkarƒÅcƒÅrya, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 105‚Äì113 Manuscripts of this text are also found titled as Sarasvati Upanisad, Saraswati Rahasyopnisad, Sarasvatyupanishad and Sarasvatirahasyopanisad.Vedic Literature, Volume 1, , Government of Tamil Nadu, Madras, India, pages 570‚Äì571, 270 In the Telugu language anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, it is listed at number 106. Contents The text has two chapters each in a distinct format. The first is structured in the style of litany hymns found in the Rigveda to Devi (goddess Sarasvati), the second part is in the Shloka (metered verse) format. The wording of the text has been layered in a way that it can be interpreted in two ways, first of dualistic Bhakti (devotional worship), second of a discourse between the devotee and the goddess representing a steady journey of the devotee towards the Vedanta philosophy, with the text's final verses climaxing with non-dualism premises, a style that Wilke and Moebus call as \\"code switching\\". The text opens with benediction unto goddess Saraswati. This benediction, also found in other Upanishads of Krishna Yajurveda, begins with \\"Do thou protect us, do thou preserve us\\". She is praised as the essence of truth, universal empress, who manifests in all things, nourishing minds and souls, and asking for her blessing. She is called the goddess of wisdom, radiant, resplendent in white, who manifests as syllables, words, sentences, meaning and understanding, thereby purifying and enriching the soul of man. She is, according to Sarasvati-rahasya Upanishad, the goddess of anything that flows, of music, of poetry, of voice, of language, of art, of imagination. The chapter 1 of the text presents the devotee's litany with words such as, \\"Oh Goddess, increase my understanding\\", \\"Sarasvati! make me like yourself\\" and \\"Sarasvati, may we remain immersed in you!\\" The text presents the conversation between Sarasvati and the devotee in the second chapter. Here, she is stated to be the power, inspiration and knowledge source for Brahma, the latter credited with authoring the Vedas. Thereafter, the text presents its theory of changing reality (Maya) and unchanging reality (Brahman). Sixteen of the text's verses from this chapter are referenced and found in their entirety in Vakyasudha (literally \\"A Nectar of Sayings\\"), an Advaita Vedanta text, as verses 13, 15‚Äì20, 23‚Äì28 and 30‚Äì32. The theme of these verses, states Dhavamony, is that \\"Brahman, the Absolute, is the ultimate ground of the objective world, and the innermost self (soul) of the subjective consciousness structure of man\\". It is the Vedantic theology of spiritual unity in everything. The verses of Saraswati-rahasya Upanishad present a discussion of Maya as the changing reality, and Brahman as the unchanging reality. For example, the following verses appear in both this Upanishad and the Vakyasudha: The text, after its ontological discussion, presents six methods of Dharana-Samadhi (concentration-union), and meditation is a means to self-knowledge and the realization of the Goddess within oneself as self-luminous, free from duality and endowed with \\"Being, Consciousness and Bliss\\". Dualism is speculation and false, asserts the text in its closing verses, and the realization of oneness of the individual soul and goddess Saravati is Mukti (freedom, liberation).

As an author he wrote on the diverse fields of both geology and heart disease. The Gibson Memorial Lecture is named after him. He was the first to discover a heart condition ‚Äì the Gibson Murmur ‚Äì which is named after him. Life He was born at Kelliebank in Muckhart on 27 January 1854, the son of George Gibson, a solicitor based in Alloa, and his wife Jane Rae Brown. He was educated at Dollar Academy. He then studied Law at both Glasgow University and Edinburgh University but instead chose to change his study to Medicine and graduated BSc in 1874. He won the Falconer Memorial Fellowship and graduated DSc in 1877 with a thesis on the old red sandstone of Shetland. He then undertook postgraduate studies in London, Dublin and Berlin, before gaining his MD from Edinburgh University in 1881. After a very brief spell at Birmingham General Hospital he was appointed Senior Physician at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh on Lauriston Place. He also worked at the New Town Dispensary and Deaconess Hospital. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1881.

Plot The temple nestles in the folds of a dense jungle. The path from the village to the temple runs through it. In the name of merit and demerit, the villagers bow to the word of the monk. The only exception is the hunter who lives in the jungle. It is him who provides all of the meat required by the people in the village. And yet, he eats no meat. It is the month of Vesak, and Gomari slips out of a group listening to a sermon to frolic with her paramour in the jungle. There they both fall prey to a leopard. The hunter, fully aware of what goes on under the jungle canopy informs the monk that the leopard had attacked Gomari and has now tasted human blood. He earnestly requests the monk to refrain from asking the people to come to the temple on Vesak Poya (full moon) day fearing that they too would fall victim to this leopard. The monks leaves such matters to fate (karma) and firmly refuses to stop the sila (observation of precept) program scheduled for the day. Finally, the hunter, who never kills anything except as food for people, is forced to kill the hungry leopard as it hunts for prey even as the monk is delivering his sermon to the villagers on Vesak full moon day. When the monk and the hunter go into the jungle the next day, all they see are the rotting corpses of Gomari and the monk.

The jail was built in 1858 to a design by Gridley James Fox Bryant, and is one of the county's architecturally significant Italianate buildings. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The Washington County Jail is located in the center of Machias, on the north side of Court Street, midway between Center and Cooper Streets. It shares the block with the Washington County Courthouse, to which it is connected by a modern ell at the rear. The jail is a three-story brick building with a hip roof and a granite foundation. A gabled entrance pavilion projects slightly from the south-facing front, and there is a cupola at the center of the original building, which has been greatly enlarged by a modern addition to the rear. The main entrance is on the second floor, which is separated from the first by a granite string course. Windows and doors on the upper floors are set in recessed panels, rounded on the third floor and arched on the second. The rounded-arch paneling is continued in a sympathetic way in the modern addition. The jail was built in 1858 to a design by Boston architect Gridley James Fox Bryant, who designed a significant number of public facilities in eastern Maine in the 1850s, including the similar Kennebec County Jail. At that time, his design embodied the latest thinking in jail facilities, with the jailor's living quarters in the front portion of the building, and cell blocks to the rear, surrounded by guard galleries. Innovations in the building included state-of-the-art ventilation and communications systems, and self-locking doors. Much of the building's original interior has been altered, owing to intervening changings in incarceration practice and theory.

Life Kinsella was born in Dublin, the younger brother of the poet and editor Thomas Kinsella. He studied viola at the College of Music (now the DIT Conservatory of Music and Drama) in Dublin and took private composition lessons with √âamonn √ì Gallchobhair for a brief period. He developed an early interest in serialism and began to explore many of the techniques evolved by the contemporary European avant-garde. Supported by Gerard Victory and the conductor Hans Waldemar Rosen he had a number of works accepted for performance by RT√â ensembles, including his first two string quartet (1960, 1968), a chamber concerto (1964), Montage (1965) for soprano and chamber ensemble, Two Pieces for String Orchestra (1965), and Montage II (1970) for orchestra. This group of works culminated in A Selected Life (1973), a large-scale composition based on verses written in memory of the recently deceased Se√°n √ì Riada by his brother Thomas. In 1968, he was appointed senior assistant in the music department of RT√â. As he found himself growing increasingly disillusioned with the avant-garde his attitude to his own work began to change: he came to question the artistic validity of much of what he had written. After completing his String Quartet No. 3 (1977) he stopped composing for 18 months.S√©amas de Barra: \\"Kinsella, John\\", in: The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland, ed. by Harry White and Barra Boydell (Dublin: UCD Press, 2013), p. 570‚Äì571. When Kinsella resumed composition it was with a resolve to find his own distinctive creative voice regardless of current fashions. The first work he composed in this new spirit of independence was The Wayfarer: Rhapsody on a Poem of P.H. Pearse (1979), commissioned for the centenary of Pearse's birth. Kinsella received the Marten Toonder Award in 1979 and became a founder member of Aosd√°na in 1981. He succeeded Victory as Head of Music in RT√â in 1983, but took early retirement in 1988 (the year he completed his Symphony No. 2) to devote himself fully to composition. As part of an arrangement made with RT√â on his retirement the station undertook to commission a series of large-scale orchestral works from him. Music Kinsella's music until about 1977 is strongly influenced by the contemporary European avant-garde, mainly serialism. Later, in De Barra's words (2013), \\"(t)he idiom Kinsella evolved [‚Ä¶] seeks to reclaim from the twelve-tone series the structuring force of tonal attraction. He organises and manipulates the row so that fundamental pitches released from it can function as substitutes for traditional tonal centres.\\"S√©amas de Barra (2013), as above, p. 570. Although Kinsella has composed both choral and vocal works, his primary interest is in instrumental music, and his most distinguished work is to be found in his string quartets, concertos and particularly his symphonies.

History  Timo Kr√§mer and Tarek Mandelartz, two students, were looking for a solution for making it easier to consume more fruits and vegetables every day. Both agreed that they did not like the smoothies and pasteurised juices in supermarkets. These still contain either a lot of sugar or just a little percentage of actual fruit, which both contradict the whole principal of eating healthier. In the spring of 2014 they started their business in Berlin, which focussed at first at a detox line. The first recipes for the juices were developed at home in the kitchen and directly sold at the door. Consumers would replace all their food during the day for 9 juices of Safterei every day, also known as juice fasting.Interview with one of the founders (German): Die Safterei ein interview Quickly they realised that the demand for the juices as normal consumption had grown large. They started a normal consumers line offering the juices to be bought per bottle for the consumer. At first only in the upperclass hotels, but in a short amount of time Safterei developed themselves as an insiders' tip amongst the juice experts in the neighbourhood and since then there has been a constantly growing amount of juicelovers throughout all of Berlin. They applied to different communities and gave multiple presentations to reach an even larger audience.Article from IHK Well-Kammer (German): Well-Kammer Oktober 2015 The production has been moved and increased a lot: nowadays the juices can be found in caf√©'s, hotels, bakeries, vegan shops and also in the supermarket.  Products  Safterei uses two techniques that are not used in the normal production process of juices: Coldpressed and High pressure processing. Cold pressing (also referred to as masticating) utilises a single gear driven by a motor; slower operation; kneads and grinds items placed in a chute. Because of this technique no heat is added to the production process, leaving the end product higher in nutrients and vitamins. The cold-pressed juices produced by Safterei are made by a form of pasteurization known as Pascalization or High pressure processing (HPP). Instead of using heat for preservation, the raw juice is exposed to be pressured by thousands of pounds. Using this method the flavor and the nutritional value of the juice is not damaged. The four different kinds of juices from Safterei Safterei produces 4 kinds of different juices for the every day consumption: *Querbeet: This dark red juice gets his color and flavor from the following main ingredients: Carrot, Beetroot, Apple, Pear and Parsnip. *Wilder√ºbe: This bright orange juice owes its natural color from the main ingredients such as: Carrot, Mango, Parsnip, Apple and Pear. *T√§glichgr√ºn: This juice mostly contains green fruits and vegetables, giving it his unique green color.

Simulations designed for this purpose have been in use since the 1970s.http://sag.sagepub.com/content/41/1/94.abstract Intercultural distinguishes itself from the term cross-cultural by asserting a contextually rich interpretative process which emphasizes interactions between and among culturally-diverse individuals. Conversely, cross-cultural communication is interested in studying how specific concepts, such as time or masculinity, are expressed and negotiated across cultures to provide a greater understanding of cultural comparison. It is therefore appropriate to apply the term intercultural to discussions of games and simulations precisely because of the conceptual emphasis on dynamic interactivity. Delving further into intercultural as a conceptual term, intercultural literacy refers to an individual‚Äôs ability to interact appropriately and effectively with members of other linguistic and cultural backgrounds. Further, intercultural competence suggests the ability of an individual to adapt verbal as well as nonverbal messages to various cultural contexts.Neuliep, J. (2015). Intercultural communication: A contextual approach. (5th Ed.). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. Finally, intercultural communication refers to the exchange of verbal and nonverbal messages between two or more interlocutors from dissimilar cultures or co-cultures. It is important to define game and simulation. Viewing games as systems of interaction, playing is a form of contact by interaction given the central role of play within games.Gee, J. P. (2013). Good video games and good learning. (2nd Ed.). New York, NY: Peter Lang. Prior to exploring specific differences between digital and non-digital games and simulations it is advisable to understand the simulation on a conceptual level. Simulations demand the use of rules. In the digital realm, simulations employ physical laws to allow for certain types of interaction. In non-digital simulation, rules are similarly necessary if only to provide parameters of behavior. In both cases, the simulation uses rules in order to affect how the individual is able to perform within its constraints. It is not necessary to win or lose: the emphasis inherent to any simulation is experience. Unlike games which position individuals in situations with opportunities to succeed or fail and whose outcomes determine the length of the game, simulations can actually persist without ending. In contrast to both terms, a simulation game is a delicate educational combination of both wherein experience is paramount to its design and appreciation but that the player/learner must gather points or credits or similar in order to proceed to further levels.Wiggins, B.E. (2012). Toward a model of intercultural communication for simulations. Simulation & Gaming, 43(4), 550-572. Here the term \\"digital\\" generally refers to computer, game-console, or online based games or simulations. In contrast, \\"non-digital\\" refers to card games, board games, or other non-electronic games or simulations. Most recently virtual environments have attracted attention given their potential for increasing intercultural literacy among users. Similar to virtual worlds, virtual environments, which largely function as interactive collaborative and training spaces, can also exist as a computer-based simulated environment. Virtual environments often allow for custom-made training solutions which can be used to promote intercultural competence. Active Worlds and Second Life, both online virtual worlds, have been the focus of scholarly investigations as to whether individuals can gain intercultural literacy and competence from such immersive learning environments. Findings generally point to their potential for enabling culturally and linguistically diverse individuals to interact with one another in digital spaces.

It is consumed as a betel quid or as paan, with or without tobacco. A sheaf of betel leaves is traditionally offered as a mark of respect and auspicious beginnings. Areca nut are kept on top of the sheaf of betel leaves and offered to the elders for their blessings and during wedding ceremonies. Mysore betel leaves are said to differ from other betel leaves because of their smooth texture and hot taste. They are protected by the government of India. Mysore Betel leaves being used to make paan History The betel leaf, which is native to the Indian subcontinent, has been used for 5000 years. About 50 years ago, the Mysore betel leaves were grown in the gardens of the Mysore Maharaja and were later spread to 100 acres from Poorniah Choultry in Old Agrahara to Vidyaranyapuram junction, which connects the Mysore-Nanjangud Road in Mysore. Gradually, it was spread to about 500 acres around Mysore. Unique climate and soil in this stretch is thought to have given the leaves a unique taste that earned it the name ‚ÄòMysore Chigurele‚Äô (Mysore sprout leaf). The leaf has a smooth texture and hot taste. Cultivation and requirement The betel plant is a tropical plant, so it needs a warm and humid climate to grow properly. It thrives best under shade and in a temperature ranging from 10 to 40 degrees. The presence of black clay in the soil along with the hot, humid climate gives the Mysore betel leaf special characteristics. Geographical Indication The Department for Horticulture under the government of Karnataka proposed the registration of the Mysore betel leaf to the Office of the Controller-General of Patents, Designs and Trademarks, Chennai, under the Geographical Indications of Goods Act (1999). This is done so that the farmers of Mysore exclusively have the right to brand their product using the term Mysore betel leaf.

In 2003, Allstars joined up with Ballymena United men's team to become their official women's team. This coincided with an unbeaten start to their Women's Premier League campaign. Ballymena United Allstars in the end failed to win the league, finishing fourth behind Glentoran Belfast United L.F.C.. Owing to renovations, they were unable to use Ballymena Showgrounds for a number of home matches and were only being offered a \\"disgraceful and embarrassing\\" pitch in a local park as a replacement. In the following years, Ballymena United Allstars often finished in mid-table in the Women's Premier League. In 2005, they reached the semi- finals of the IFA Women's Challenge Cup but lost 2‚Äì0 to Northland Raiders F.C.. In 2012, they made the final of the Premier League Cup however they lost 2‚Äì0 to Glentoran Belfast United. In 2014, they finished 3rd last above Shankill United Predators F.C., just avoiding the promotion/relegation playoff. In 2015, the club finished last in the Women's Premier League with only 2 draws and were relegated to the Women's Championship.

Mezher, a 22-year-old worker at an asylum center, of Lebanese Christian origin, was stabbed by a male asylum seeker at a refuge for unaccompanied minors in M√∂lndal, Sweden. The attacker, a Somalian male, was posing as an underage unaccompanied refugee claiming to be 15, but, after the attack, medical examination determined that he was at least 18 years old. Background More than 160,000 applications for asylum were accepted in Sweden in 2015; that total included 35,400 unaccompanied minor refugees. The asylum center where the attack took place is located near Gothenburg and was intended for minors between the ages of 14 and 17 who arrived in Sweden as asylum seekers without adult guardians. The center is owned and operated by HVB Living Nordic, which runs four HVB-hem (\\"Homes for Care or Living\\"), of which the M√∂lndal center is one. Staff at the asylum center had expressed concerns about security to their employer. Mezher herself had expressed worries to her mother about being the guardian for \\"big powerful guys\\" aged up to 24. A preliminary investigation on occupational safety and health violations was started in March 2016 but dropped in April 2017. The attack came shortly after National Police Commissioner Dan Eliasson requested 4,100 new staff and police officers to cover the increased demand for security at asylum centers, to carry out deportations, and to protect the country against terrorism.  Killing  The incident started with the suspect attempting to commit suicide with a knife belonging to the asylum center. Mezher, the sole staff member present in the center at the time of the attack, was stabbed at the center and was later taken to a hospital with life-threatening injuries. The injuries proved fatal. Two fellow residents in the center, which housed eleven youths, helped overpower the attacker. One male resident was also stabbed in the process by the suspect but managed to avoid significant injuries. Police refrained from releasing information about the attacker's identity for about three days, after which they stated that he had identified himself on arrival in Sweden as Youssaf Khaliif Nuur, a migrant from Somalia who claimed to be 15-years-old. On 11 February, the Swedish newspaper G√∂teborgs-Posten reported that the Swedish Migration Agency, in their decision to deny his application for residency, determined that the attacker was 18 or older. According to the prosecutor in the stabbing case, medical examinations indicated that he was an adult. A psychiatric evaluation by the Swedish National Board of Forensic Medicine determined that the attacker likely suffered from a psychological disorder and recommended a more thorough evaluation before the trial. Thomas Westin, station chief with the Stockholm City Police, called the killing \\"a high-profile crime.\\"  Victim  The victim, Lebanon-born 22-year-old Alexandra Mezher, worked at the center in the months prior to the attack out of a desire to \\"do good\\", according to one of her cousins.  Aftermath  Sweden's Prime Minister, Stefan L√∂fven, visited the scene of the attack. He later told Radio Sweden that he \\"believe[s] that there are quite many people in Sweden who feel a lot of concern that there can be more cases of this kind when Sweden receives so many children and youth who come alone [to seek asylum].\\" The day after the stabbing, an editorial in Expressen called for the expulsion of migrants who committed crimes. The attack raised concerns about overcrowded conditions in Sweden's asylum centers, the possibility of adult migrants taking advantage of Swedish law to fraudulently register as minors. Trial In May 2016, the attacker was charged with murder of Mezher and the attempted murder of another resident at the asylum center. According to the charge sheet, Mezher was stabbed three times before she fled to another room, with one of the wounds severing blood vessels in her thigh causing severe blood loss. The attacker was suicidal at the time and reportedly said he had tried to kill himself at the time of the attack. In August, 2016 he was sentenced to psychiatric care, ordered to pay SEK 300,000 in compensation to Mezher's family. If discharged, he will also be deported and forbidden from returning to Sweden until 2026. After appeal, the court of appeal upheld the sentence, except extending the deportation until 2031.

Halfe's Cree name is Sky Dancer. At the age of seven, she was forced to attend Blue Quills Residential School in St. Paul, Alberta. Halfe signed with Coteau Books in 1994 and has published four books of poetry: Bear Bones & Feathers (1994), Blue Marrow (1998/2005), The Crooked Good (2007) and Burning in this Midnight Dream (2016). Halfe uses code-switching, white space, and the stories of other Cree women in her poetry. Her experience at Blue Quills continues to influence her work today. Halfe's books have been well-received and have won multiple awards.  Personal life  Louise Halfe was born on April 8, 1953. She is also known by her Cree name Sky Dancer. She was born in Two Hills, Alberta, and was raised on the Saddle Lake Reserve. When she was seven years old, Louise was forced to attend Blue Quills Residential School in St. Paul, Alberta; she remained there for nine years. At the age of sixteen, she left home and broke ties with her family. This gave her the opportunity to complete her studies at St. Paul's Regional High School. While Halfe attended high school, she developed an interest in writing. She started a journal to write about her memories and life experiences. During her six years at The University of Saskatchewan, Halfe lived off campus in Northern Saskatchewan. Halfe earned a Bachelor of Social Work from the University of Regina and a certificate in Drug and Alcohol Counselling from the Nechi Institute. Louise currently lives in Saskatoon with her husband. She has two children and three grandchildren.  Career  In 1990, Halfe was first published in the collection Writing the Circle: Native Women of Western Canada. Her next publication was a piece in Residential Schools: The Stolen Years (1993) which was a collection of writing by residential school survivors. Her first book, Bear Bones & Feathers, was started in a journal during her academic career; it was published in 1994. She has published three more books: Blue Marrow (2004), Crooked Good (2007), and Burning in This Midnight Dream (2016). In 2018, as part of the Laurier Poetry Series, her previously published works were compiled in S√¥hk√™yihta: The Poetry of Sky Dancer Louise Bernice Halfe. In 2005, Halfe became Saskatchewan's Poet Laureate. She is the second person ever to hold the title. Then, in 2012, Halfe received an honorary Doctorate of Letters from Wilfrid Laurier University. She is currently the acting Elder at the University of Saskatchewan.  Poetic style  Halfe uses code-switching in her work. Code-switching is largely a response to the devastation of Aboriginal languages. Their loss is connected to the legacy of residential schools. The use of code-switching shows a fragmentation of history, culture, and land base which cannot be conveyed through English alone. Halfe code- switches between Cree and English, as well as between Cree-English and standardized English. Halfe personalizes the Cree language in her work by using possessive kinship terms. Halfe is also known to use the language of the church, or \\"Whiteman's words,\\" in her work. Halfe has said that writing helps her reconnect to her culture and language. Halfe writes poetry about the women that have come before her. Her writing focuses on the kinship relations between women, the stories women have to tell, and their histories. Halfe's poetry reasserts the importance of women in Cree culture. Halfe works with Cree intellectual traditions in her poetry. She tells women's stories to explore the link between creation and knowledge in Cree storytelling. In The Crooked Good, Halfe explores Cree sacred history using a Cree feminist perspective. Halfe incorporates the white space on the page into the meaning of her poems. The white space represents the settler-colonial idea of terra nullius and, therefore, signifies erasure, a loss of language, and an inability to speak. Every word she writes on the page is a political act against silence and erasure. Halfe often writes about a connection to the land that is both spiritual and political. Halfe titled her book Blue Marrow to invoke the image of using a bone writing in blue ink. The title re- appropriates the \\"blue quill\\" of Blue Quills Residential School. Much of Halfe's poetry reflects on her time at the school and the effect it had on her, her family, and her community.  Critical reception  Halfe's work has been generally well accepted. Cahoots Magazine has praised her use of Aboriginal spirality and feminist exposure in Bear Bones & Feathers. Her book Burning in This Midnight Dream received numerous awards, such as the Saskatchewan Book Awards and the Indigenous Peoples' Publishing Award. The judges from these events have stated that Halfe's poetic storytelling reflects the harm inflicted by Canada's residential school system, calling her verses \\"heartbreaking and hopeful\\" and noting her attention to creating a healing atmosphere through specific use of Cree language and culture. Other works by Halfe have received similar reviews, often applauding Halfe's use of code- switching for taking back the Cree language. This is prominent in Halfe's Blue Marrow and S√¥hk√™yihta: The Poetry of Sky Dancer Louise Bernice Halfe. Critics have also noted Halfe's focus on both mind and spirituality. Cheryl Petten for the Saskatchewan Review had noted that readers not only responded intellectually Halfe's The Crooked Good but emotionally as well.  Awards  Louise Halfe has won many awards and has received positive recognition as an independent Canadian author and poet. After making her debut, Halfe won third place in the League of Canadian Poets' Historical Poetry Contest. Her first book of poetry, Bear Bones & Feathers, won the Milton Acorn People's Poet Award in 1996. Blue Marrow was nominated for the Pat Lowther First Book Award. In 1998, Blue Marrow was a finalist for the Governor General's Award for Poetry, the Saskatoon Book Award, and the Saskatchewan Poetry Award. The Crooked Goodwon the First Peoples Publishing Award and the Saskatoon Book Award in 2008. It was also nominated for the Poetry Award honouring Anne Szumigalski in the same year. Halfe was also shortlisted for the Spirit of Saskatchewan Award. In 2017, Burning in This Midnight Dream won the Indigenous Peoples' Publishing award, the Rasmussen, Ramussen & Charowsky Indigenous Peoples' Writing award and the Saskatchewan Arts Board Poetry Award. Burning in This Midnight Dream also won the League of Canadian Poets Raymond Souster Award and the High Plains Book Award for Indigenous Writers. Burning in This Midnight Dream was also the 2017 WILLA Literacy Award Finalist in Poetry. In 2016, Halfe received the Hnatyshyn Foundation REVEAL award which recognizes Indigenous artists living in Canada and, in 2017, she was given the Latner Writers' Trust Award in recognition of a remarkable body of work.

History  Simwonsa Temple (Korean: Ïã¨ÏõêÏÇ¨, Chinese: Ê∑±Ê∫êÂØ∫, Pronounced ‚ÄúSeem-won-sa‚Äù) is thought to have been established around the 8th century. The above poem written by Yi Sung-in describes it as an ancient temple, so it is thought to have existed long before the Goryeo era. One record says the temple was renovated by Ven. Jiwon during the reign of Joseon's King Jungjong (r. 1506-1544), but Simwonsa Temple was reduced to ashes during the Japanese invasion (1592-1597). Beomugo (Temple Directory of Joseon), published in 1799, describes it as abandoned and so it seems likely to have already been in ruins in the 18th century. It was reconstructed in 2003 as part of Seongju County's project, ‚ÄúRestoration Plan of Cultural Tourism Resources in the Region of Mt. Gayasan National Park.‚Äù In preliminary excavation surveys, it was confirmed that Simwonsa Temple had been a typical United Silla era mountain temple. It had three Buddha halls built above four- story terraced retaining walls and its land measured 80 meters (262 feet) north to south and 100 meters (328 feet) east to west. Among the artifacts discovered were a pedestal for a stone Buddha statue, a salutation stone, a nimbus from a Buddha statue, a seated stone Vairocana Buddha statue, and a stone that was part of the base of a stone pagoda. All of these collectively are designated Cultural Heritage Materials of North Gyeongsang Province No. 525. = Sinwonsa temple in poetry = Cultural properties  Although Simwonsa Temple was recently restored after a long period of abandonment, there remained the Three-Story Stone Pagoda (Cultural Heritage Material of North Gyeongsang Province No. 116), and a Woodblock for Choosing Auspicious and Inauspicious Days (Treasure No. 1647). Inscribed at Buseoksa Temple in Yeongju during the reign of Goryeo's King Gojong (r. 1122-1146), this printing woodblock lists special days. Many temple ruins are scattered around the area: the Beopsusa Temple Ruins (another great temple of the Silla era), Yonggisa Temple Ruins, Iryoam Hermitage Ruins and a temple ruin at Baegun-ri.

It was found that the black clay alluvial saline soil found in and around Nanjangud drastically changed the taste and aroma, giving it a particular geographical identity, so it is now registered under geographical indicators under Government of India. Uniqueness The Nanjangud banana is said to have a unique taste and aroma due to the black clay alluvial saline soil found in and around Nanjangud and the unique method of organic cultivation. It was found that if it is grown in other places, the banana would develop hard lump and lose its aroma. The uniqueness in its trait is being attributed to its genetic make up. Cultivation and requirement The Nanjangud banana is a tropical plant and is restricted to the region of 30N to 30S of latitude. A dry and humid climate is said to be the best condition for its growth. Geographical Indication The Department for Horticulture under the government of Karnataka proposed the registration of the Nanjangud banana under the Geographical Indications of Goods Act, 1999, to the Office of the Controller-General of Patents, Designs and Trademarks, Chennai, in order to give the farmers of Mysore the right to exclusively brand their products as Nanjanagud bananas.

Ludovico Gonzaga (1481 - June 1540) was an Italian nobleman and condottiero, a member of the House of Gonzaga branch of Sabbioneta. Biography He was born at Bozzolo, the son of Gianfrancesco Gonzaga and Antonia del Balzo. At his father's death, he received parts of the family lands including Rodigo and, together with his brother Pirro, Gazzuolo, Sabbioneta, Pomponesco and Dosolo. The other two sons, Federico (1484-1527) and Gianfrancesco (who died in his youth), received Bozzolo, Rivarolo and Isola Dovarese, while San Martino was to be shared among all the brothers. Ludovico was sent by his father at the court of king Charles VIII of France; later, he received by emperor Maximilian I the right to mint coins at Sabbioneta and Bozzolo. In 1509 he took part in the Siege of Padua. One year later he defended Verona and obtained the title of governor of that city. In 1511, at the death of his uncle Ludovico Gonzaga, bishop of Mantua, he received the fiefs of Ostiano and Castel Goffredo, causing some strife with his relatives of the main Gonzaga branch of Mantua. In 1515 he was hired as commander by Pope Leo X and one year later he was under Francesco II Gonzaga of Mantua. In 1517 he bought, for 20,000 ducats, the fief of Casalmaggiore, but after a siege he was forced to surrender it to the Sforza. Ludovico Gonzaga lived most of the time in Sabbioneta, which he had received by Pirro, together with his wife Francesca Fieschi and the family. Their children include: Louis (Rodomonte) (1500-1532), Gianfrancesco \\"Cagnino\\" (1502-1529), both military leaders; Pirro (1505-1529), a Roman Catholic cardinal; Giulia (1513-1566), wife of Vespasiano Colonna; Ippolita (died 1571), bride of Galeotto II Pico della Mirandola; and Paola (died 1550), who married Gian Galeazzo Sanvitale. Since no son survived him, at Ludovico's death his lands went to Vespasiano I Gonzaga, Louis' eldest son.

The Amalgamated Society of Journeymen Felt Hatters and Allied Workers (ASJFH) was founded in 1872. It brought together various local unions, to represent men working in the hat-making industry. Based in Denton, Greater Manchester, it gradually expanded its membership, first to Stockport, then to London, Atherstone, Nuneaton and St AlbansH. A. Silverman, Studies in Industrial Organization, pp.163, 167 One of the ASJFH's early campaigns was against the employment of women in the industry in the West Midlands. Having lost this dispute,Sallie Hellier Hogg, The Employment of Women in Great Britain, 1891-1921, p.118 in 1888 it formed the Amalgamated Felt Hat Trimmers, Woolformers and Allied Workers Union (AFHTW&AWF;) to represent women working in the industry. Despite being registered as separate unions, the two operated from the same office and had the same general secretary, invariably a man. However, their funds were kept separately, and the women's union offered fewer benefits.The Industrial History of Britain, \\"Jolly Hatters and its connection with the trade union movement\\" The women's union campaigned for women's suffrage, and co-sponsored the 1906 United Manifesto with organisations including the Women's Social and Political Union.Elizabeth Crawford, The Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide, 1866-1928, p.731 From 1893, the organisations began producing union labels for members to place inside hats they had made.Paul Martin, The Trade Union Badge: Material Culture in Action, p.36 The unions undertook a major strike in 1907, in an attempt to prevent the employment of youths on certain machines.H. A.

After his exclusion from the Bavarian Christian Social Union in 1949 he spent three decades as a right-wing political activist, on many occasions positioned beyond the frontiers of West Germany's consensual political mainstream. During the 1980s he remained politically active, but now as a somewhat unconventional member of the German Green party. He is sometimes identified by the pseudonym under which he occasionally wrote, as Karl Konstantin. Life=Before 1945= Relatively little is known for certain about Hau√üleiter's life before 1945. Much of what is known comes from what Hau√üleiter himself wrote, or from party publications emanating from Deutsche Gemeinschaft, the right-wing political movement with which he was associated in the 1950s, and not all of this can be agreed to more neutral sources. Hau√üleiter himself also managed to disseminate differing versions of his past.Richard St√∂ss: Parteien-Handbuch: die Parteien der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, 1945‚Äì1980. Band 1 AUD bis EFP. Westdeutscher Verlag, 1983, p. 878. August Hau√üleiter was the son of a Lutheran minister. He was born and grew up in Nuremberg. According to his own statements, he lost his parents at a young age and grew up as an orphan.Deutsche Gemeinschaft (Zt.), Nr. 39, 17 January 1963, p. 3 (‚ÄûWer ist August Hau√üleiter‚Äú) He became politically aware early on, and while still at secondary school joined \\"national defence organisations\\".Hans Frederik: Die Rechtsradikalen. Humboldt-Verlag, M√ºnchen 1965, p. 57. At the age of 15 he was arrested by police for the first time, while participating in a major political confrontation. Much later, in 1957, Hau√üleiter himself would write that during the quasi-civil war that persisted following the upheavals of 1918/1919 his own political focus remained unclear. He saw the so-called German Day mass marches of 1920‚Äì22 in North Bavaria as a manifestation of a wider evolving nationalist mood, and he would only slowly take to heart the lessons of the 9 November 1923 confrontation, remembered in history as the Hitler-Ludendorff Putsch. \\"You must retain a sober judgement and correctly evaluate the strengths of the enemy if you want to secure lasting results in the political struggle\\" (\\" Man muss n√ºchtern bleiben, und man muss die Feindst√§rke richtig beurteilen, wenn man dauernde Ergebnisse im politischen Kampfe erzielen will\\").√úber die Weimarer Zeit lie√ü Hau√üleiter 1957 folgendes √ºber sich ver√∂ffentlichen: \\"In den b√ºrgerkriegs√§hnlichen Zust√§nden jener Jahre hielt es ihn nicht zu Hause. Die gro√üen ‚ÄöDeutschen Tage‚Äò in Nordbayern sahen ihn als einen der jungen Vork√§mpfer der nationalen Bewegung jener Jahre, und der Zusammenbruch des 9. November 1923 [Hitler-Ludendorff-Putsch] trafen den damals Achtzehnj√§hrigen bis ins Herz. (...) Er hat damals eines gelernt: Man muss n√ºchtern bleiben, und man muss die Feindst√§rke richtig beurteilen, wenn man dauernde Ergebnisse im politischen Kampfe erzielen will.\\" The commentators Martin A. Lee and Richard St√∂ss appear both to assume that Hau√üleiter was a participant in the (failed) Hitler-Ludendorff Putsch. Others, including Silke Mende, are content to infer from sources including Hau√üleiter's own autobiographical writings of 1957, that in 1923 Hau√üleiter was still \\"looking for nationalistic groups to join\\" (...er schon fr√ºh \\"Anschluss an nationalistische Gruppen suchte\\"). After passing his school final exams (Abitur) he studied theology and philosophy locally at Erlangen University, while undertaking paid work to fund his studies. In 1924 he became a member of the Onoldia student fraternity. Various sources indicate that before 1933 Hau√üleiter was a member of the German People's Party (\\"Deutsche Volkspartei\\" / DVP), formerly the National Liberal party). From 1928 Hau√üleiter worked as an economics and politics editor with the Fr√§nkische Kurier (newspaper). The hitherto conservative newspaper had transformed itself since 1918 into an anti-republican, sometimes anti-Semitic \\"nationalist\\" publication, and thereby indirectly helped to prepare the way for National Socialism, even if before 1933 it found itself condemned by the Nazis as a mouthpiece for Chancellor von Papen (als \\"Papen-Blatt\\"). Hau√üleiter remained with the Kurier for another seven years following the savage regime change of 1933, a period during which Nazi criticism of the publication became infrequent, although as the Nazi government struggled to tame opposition from the churches they continued to criticise the Kurier's pro-church stance (\\"kirchenfreundliche Haltung\\"). Richard St√∂ss asserts that during his time with the Kurier, Hau√üleiter wrote a succession of articles justifying Nazi policies including those involving anti-Semitism. In 1940 August Hau√üleiter had a major altercation with the Julius Streicher. Streicher, who lived in Nuremberg, was both the local Gauleiter and a top Nazi. The result of the altercation was that in 1940 August Hau√üleiter was removed from the Fr√§nkische Kurier. There is a suggestion, which may have originated with Hau√üleiter himself, that it was a few years earlier that Hau√üleiter became the involuntary cause of a ban on art criticism imposed by the Nazi Propaganda Minister. War had broken out the previous year, and later in 1940 Hau√üleiter was conscripted into the army. He spent the rest of the war employed in the 13th Army Corps. In 1942 he was badly wounded on the Russian Front. Later the same year he published a book, entitled \\"\\"An der mittleren Ostfront\\"\\" about the war on the Russian Front. In the context of Hau√üleiter's post-war political career this book would attract far more critical attention than would have seemed likely at the time of its publication. Later he was switched to the western front, ending up in 1945 as a US prisoner of war. =After 1945= Hau√üleiter was released from the prisoner-of-war camp later in 1945 and took a teaching job at a school in Neudrossenfeld,Manfred Jenke: Verschw√∂rung von Rechts? Ein Bericht √ºber den Rechtsradikalismus in Deutschland nach 1945. Colloquium Verlag, Berlin 1961, p. 261. a small town between Nuremberg and Erfurt. In 1946, at nearby Kulmbach, he was one of the co-founders of the Bavarian Christian Social Union (Christlich-Soziale Union in Bayern) party. The Christian Social Union was a regional political party for Bavaria, an overwhelmingly Roman Catholic state within Germany. The district around Nuremberg was a protestant enclave within Bavaria, however, and Hau√üleiter's own protestant provenance was an important part of broadening the party's coverage beyond Bavaria's catholic majority, although his protestantism would also help to make Hau√üleiter in some respects an outsider.Munzinger, Internationales Biographisches Archiv Nr.35/1989, 21 August 1989 He nevertheless represented a long standing liberal conservative and federalist tradition as well as Bavaria's protestant minority within the Christian Social Union. In 1946 he became a Christian Social Union member of the Bavarian state parliament (Landtag) and of the important Landtag committee for drawing up the new Bavarian constitution, party positions which he retained till his forced resignation from the Christian Social Union in 1949. In 1947 Hau√üleiter was temporarily deprived of his party endorsement by means of a majority vote of Christian Social Union members in the Bavarian state legislature (Landtag). It was stated that this was because his writings, in particular his 1942 book \\"An der mittleren Ostfront\\" (1942), were excessively militaristic in tone, and implied support for Nazi ideology. Hau√üleiter appealed to the Bavarian Constitutional Court, and after winning his case before the arbitration board, he was successful in recovering the party mandate on 16 January 1948.Peter Jakob Kock: Der Bayerische Landtag 1946 bis 1986. Band 1. Bayerische Verlagsanstalt, 1986, S. 39. A few weeks later, on 29 February 1948, Hau√üleiter was elected a deputy chairman of the Christian Social Union. The suspicion was allowed to grow that the underlying cause of the problems Hau√üleiter faced within the Christian Social Union arose because he was a member of Bavaria's Protestant minority. The disclosure in 1980 of hitherto confidential documents indicate that a major additional issue was the inclusion of Hau√üleiter's name on a list of suspected Nazi sympathizers compiled by the intelligence services supporting the US occupation authorities. Following major internal differences between rival wings of the Christian Social Union in Bavaria, Hau√üleiter finally resigned from the party in September 1949. By that time, he had been able to prepare the way for an alternative political focus, having been a co-founder at Braunschweig in January 1949 of the Deutsche Gemeinschaft (German Union), not merely a Bavarian entity but a German one, defined as a cross party non-doctrinaire movementStefanie Waske: Nach Lekt√ºre vernichten. Der Geheime Nachrichtendienst von CDU/CSU im Kalten Krieg. p. 25 whose objectives included the preparation of a democratic revolution (\\"Vorbereitung einer demokratischen Revolution\\"). The programme of the German Union was compiled by Hau√üleiter with Gerhard Kr√ºger, a former Nazi party official who before the end of the year left the German Union in order to join the more overtly extremist Socialist Reich Party.Henning Hansen: Die Sozialistische Reichspartei (SRP): Aufstieg und Scheitern einer rechtsextremen Partei. Droste-Verlag, 2007, p. 40. With Ferdinand Zimmermann, another fellow journalist, whose backing for the Nazi regime before 1945 appears to have been less nuanced than his own, Hau√üleiter produced the German Union's weekly political journal, \\"Die deutsche Wirklichkeit\\" (\\"The German Reality\\"). At the end of 1949 the German Union evolved/merged into the German Community (Deutsche Gemeinschaft / DG), with Hau√üleiter a leading spokesman of what was had in effect become another German political party. As a leading DG figure in Bavaria, August Hau√üleiter advocated a merger for Bavarian political purposes with the League of expellees and dispossessed (\\"Bund der Heimatvertriebenen und Entrechteten\\" / BHE), a grouping representing the millions of victims of ethnic cleansing whose former homes had ended up on the wrong side of Germany's new eastern frontier, and many of whom had ended up as refugees in Bavaria. A merger and cooperation agreement between the DG and the BHE were duly completed for the Bavarian state election of 10 October 1950, following which the DG achieved six seats in the Bavarian state legislature (Landtag). Hau√üleiter was one of the six, and led the DG group in the Landtag between 1950 and 1952. During 1952 the little DG grouping in the Landtag splintered as members drifted off to other parties, while the alliance with the BHE also came to an end as refugees made new lives and moved on politically and, sometimes, geographically. The two remaining DG Landtag members were August Hau√üleiter and the doctor-pediatrician Renate Malluche, whom he would later marry. The two of them continued to sit in the Bavarian Landtag, now without any party affiliation, for more than another two years, from April 1952 till December 1954. Anticipating (correctly) the subsequent outlawing of the Socialist Reich Party (SRP), on 4 October 1952 Hau√üleiter instigated a meeting with Karl-Heinz Priester, a right-wing extremist who had recently established his own \\"Deutsch-Soziale Bewegung\\" (literally \\"German Social Movement\\"). Their purpose was to discuss how they might, along with Werner Boll of the Deutsche Reichspartei (German National Party) work together to pick up SRP activists after their own party had been banned (as indeed, in West Germany, it was, along with the Communist Party, in 1956).Oliver Sowinski: Die Deutsche Reichspartei 1950‚Äì1965: Organisation und Ideologie einer rechtsradikalen Partei. Peter Lang Verlag, 1998, p. 130. Hau√üleiter further burnished his credentials as a right-wing extremist during this period with his contributions to the right-wing newspaper, Nation Europa, frequently identified as a pro-Nazi publication. For the West German General Election of 1953 Hau√üleiter organised an electoral alliance of extreme right wing parties into a grouping named the Dachverband der Nationalen Sammlung (DNS) in which the principal players were himself, Karl-Heinz Priester and Karl Mei√üner (Deutscher Block). The grouping's message failed to resonate with electors, however, and it won just 0.3% of the popular vote. In 1965 Hau√üleiter was persuaded by to become a founder member of the Action Community for an independent Germany (\\"Aktionsgemeinschaft Unabh√§ngiger Deutscher\\"), a nationalist anti-war political grouping which in the next few years became increasingly focused on environmental issues, and in the end, in 1979, merged into the embryonic forerunner of the German Green party. After 1967 he also produced the AUD's party newspaper, \\"Die Unabh√§ngigen\\" (\\"The Independents\\"). The AUD failed to gain traction with he German electorate, and in preparation for the European Parliament election of 1979 it joined together with various other fringe political groupings, most of them recently emerged as part of the surge in environmental awareness and concern that was a feature of the 1970s in West Germany. They presented themselves initially as a \\"joint list\\" under the name \\"Sonstige politische Vereinigung Die Gr√ºnen\\". Hau√üleiter produced a newspaper for the political grouping which some suggested was simply a continuation of the party newspaper he had hitherto been producing for the AUD, but it came with a new name, \\"Die Gr√ºnen\\" (\\"The Greens\\"). He became a spokesman for the new grouping/party, which consciously refused to define itself in terms of \\"left-right\\" politics and also, possibly to avoid a public \\"left-right\\" split, resisted the idea of electing a single party leader. The German Green Party was formally inaugurated at a congress in Karlsruhe in January 1980, and two months later, at a follow-up party congress held at Saarbr√ºcken, he was elected as one of the spokespersons for the new party, and a member of its collective leadership team. At the age of 75 August Hau√üleiter was by now a forgotten albeit colourful figure from West Germany's political past. His unexpected appearance as a possible candidate for the job of Chancellor, campaigning on behalf of The Greens against Franz Josef Strauss and Helmut Schmidt in the forthcoming general election, attracted a surge in public interest, however. Press attention included a hitherto unfamiliar level of interest in Hau√üleiter's erratic political career to date, on his wartime writings, and on some of his more controversial political fellow travelers since 1945. On 24 April 1980 the political television magazine programme, Monitor transmitted a lengthy feature on Hau√üleiter, referring to his war diary and including footage from the 1957 party conference of the DG. Various Hau√üleiter quotations from the early 1950s were also included, and the programme concluded that Hau√üleiter was really a Nazi.

His successor was , a less flamboyant performer, who also came from the formerly AUD wing of the party, but was too young to have published anything during the war. 1980 did not mark the end of August Hau√üleiter's political career in The Green Party. He continued to produce the party's weekly newspaper. In 1986 he was back as a member of the Bavarian state parliament (Landtag), but he resigned in 1987 on health grounds.

After being wanted internationally since 2012, Dale was in 2014 listed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the United States Department of State, and blacklisted by the United Nations Security Council. Early life Born to Norwegian parents, Dale grew up in Nesodden. He was a member of the Green Party, and appeared as a low-level candidate on the party's election lists in Oslo for the 2007 municipal elections. He was reportedly a member of the left-wing radical Blitz movement in his youth, and described himself as an anarchist and marxist. Dale converted to Islam in 2008, and began attending the Rabita Mosque. The same year, he was interviewed in an NRK radio program as a Norwegian Muslim convert who criticised \\"media propaganda\\" portraying Muslims as being violent. His family contacted the police after he took part in the 2008‚Äì09 Oslo riots. Designated terrorist Dale first travelled to Yemen to join Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in 2008, and returned to Norway several times until December 2011. During his time in Yemen he is thought to have received bomb-making training by Ibrahim al-Asiri, specifically to make bomb-belts, improvised explosives and explosives used in car bombs. He broke off contacts with his pregnant wife, a Moroccan he married in 2010 following the last trip, and was reported missing by his family in April 2012. Dale became wanted by the intelligence services of several countries in 2012, suspected of having planned a terrorist attack against the London 2012 Summer Olympics. In July 2014, Dale was listed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the United States Department of State. He was also charged under Norway's anti-terror laws by the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST), after having been under investigation for several years. It was reported later the same month that Dale was the reason for increased security measures being introduced on direct flights to the United States. In September 2014, he was blacklisted by the United Nations Security Council as one of eleven wanted terrorists requested to be blacklisted by the United States. One of the perpetrators of the January 2015 Charlie Hebdo shooting, Sa√Ød Kouachi, is considered likely to have met Dale as he trained with AQAP in Yemen in 2011. According to Norwegian and American intelligence services there are clear indications that Dale is alive as of 2015.

More specifically, it can be framed in theme 1, \\"Climate Change\\", and within the line of action \\"Development of innovative practices for the management of smart grids in the context of highly decentralized production of renewable energy\\". Its main objective is to demonstrate, through the implementation of a full-scale industrial smartgrid that microgrids can become one of the most suitable solutions for energy generation and management in factories that want to minimize their environmental impact. At a national level it is one of the first experiences regarding the implementation of a smartgrid in an industrial plant with and integrated fleet of electric vehicles. Factory Microgrid will take place between July 2014 and June 2017 and it represents an investment of around 2 million euros. Approximately 50% of the total amount will be financed by the LIFE + programme. Project partners are the Jofemar Corporation and the National Renewable Energy Centre, CENER. Project Manager: Isabel Carrilero (Jofemar)  Introduction - Smartgrid  What is a microgrid or a smartgrid?https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/markets-and-consumers/smart- grids-and-meters Smart grids are energy networks that can automatically monitor energy flows and adjust to changes in energy supply and demand accordingly. When coupled with smart metering systems, smart grids reach consumers and suppliers by providing information on real-time consumption. Smart grids can also help to better integrate renewable energy.  Main environmental benefits  * Enhance the use of renewable energies, while reducing CO2 emissions. * Decrease power peak consumption and provide ancillary services, increasing grid reliability and reducing, at the same time, the need of reserve generation capacity in the electric system. * Minimize energy consumption due to the management of dispatchable loads, reducing CO2 emissions. * Reduce the use of land for electric generation. * Reduce transport and distribution losses. * Transport electrification, which is particularly advantageous when electricity mix comes from a low CO2 origin.

Goodall (Marland), was born May 24, 1875 in Sanford, Maine, the daughter of Goodall mills business mogul George Goodall and his wife Henrietta D. Goodall. Marion Goodall was a wife, mother, and philanthropist throughout her life, providing financial donations and her time to multiple projects until her passing on December 16, 1958.  Early life  Marion Goodall was born May 24, 1875 to Henrietta D. (Bennett) Goodall and George Goodall. She was the couple‚Äôs only child and began her life in their family home on School Street in Sanford, Maine. Fabric Mogul George Goodall allowed Marion to thrive in her early years. She was home schooled early on and was then sent to the Bellows School, in Portland, Maine. Marion Goodall was by her father‚Äôs side through most of her childhood and in later years after her marriage. Goodall engaged herself in many activities both in and out of the home. One Kennebunk, Maine newspaper of the time mentioned her competing with a group of other young women in various rowing and sailing events at their family home in Cape Porpoise, Maine (the home today still standing). During this time a man by the name of William Marland was visiting Sanford on business and the two were introduced; by 1903 they were wed. In 1907 the Marlands moved to Brookline, Massachusetts. William became the Boston-based representative for the Sanford Mills as the manager of the company's new artificial leather plant. In Massachusetts the couple began the construction of a new home. The couple hired architect Walter H. Killam to design their house in 1914 and Marion became in charge of choosing design elements for their new home.  Return to Maine  In 1923 Marion‚Äôs mother Henrietta Goodall visited the couple for Thanksgiving; she fell violently ill and contracted pneumonia. She later died that December. Her death ushered in the creation of the Henrietta D. Goodall Memorial Hospital. Marion's father George Goodall donated all the necessary funds to successfully create the first full service healthcare facility in Sanford. The facility opened its doors in August 1928 with George Goodall becoming the primary benefactor of the hospital. In the late 1920s, George Goodall fell ill on a trip to Hollywood, California, while visiting the west coast home of his brother Louis B. Goodall Upon George Goodall's passing William Marland became the President of the Sanford Mills. Marion Marland, the only child of George Goodall, received a total of $600,000 after the estate was divided amongst the family and community charities. Gender expectations of the time prevented Marion Goodall from assuming control of the Goodall Enterprises. However, upon the passing of George Goodall, the Marlands also became the sole benefactors of the newly established Goodall Hospital. William Marland was in charge of the financial status of the hospital and Marion was in charge of decorating and renovating the hospital rooms to create an experience that was pleasurable, with custom furniture and draperies and fabrics with \\"happy colors\\". Taking control of Goodall enterprises led to the couple to move from their home in Brookline, Massachusetts, to Marion's late father's home on School Street in Sanford, Maine. This was the home the two resided in for the duration of their lives.  Later life  The lives of Marion and her husband, William, were one of both work and play. The two were active philanthropists. William conducted all of the hospital's financial business and Marion provided her time and expertise in keeping the hospital staff in good morale and the building in good style. The two had no children of their own however, they adopted a girl by the name of Elfreida, the child of one of their servants. Elfrieda and her husband, Walter, provided the Marlands with three grandchildren. Marion and William in their later years provided multiple donations, and were known as gracious philanthropists to multiple organizations around the town. One noted gift, in particular, was a large donation to Nasson College in Springvale, Maine, in the form of a dormitory building known as Marland Hall. Marion Goodall died in Sanford, Maine, on December 16, 1958. She is buried in the family plot at Oakdale Cemetery in Sanford.

Horse archery  Original Kassai System Equestrian Archery Track √ñlyv (red) and Farkas II. (black) bows Kassai created the competitive rule system of horse archery in the late 1980s, and started to propagate this new sport, first in Hungary, and from the 1990s in the rest of Europe, the United States and Canada. He made himself familiar with Zen-archery in Kamakura, Japan, and travelled to Shao-lin in China to study. He summarized his experiences in his book \\"Horse archery\\", which since its issue has been translated into German, English and Russian.Lajos Kassai : Lovas√≠j√°szat, Dee-Sign Kiad√≥, Budapest, 2001, 2002, 2003 , P√ºski Kiad√≥, 2006 . He founded the center of Hungarian horse archery, Kassai-valley, near Kaposm√©r≈ë.A Kassai-v√∂lgy . Horse archery centers based on the Kassai-school are currently operating in fourteen countries, and organize world cups regularly. In 2011, the University of Physical Education accepted the education practice developed by Kassai and began horse archery training. Hungary is the first country in the world where one can get a teaching diploma in horse archery. His life and work was dramatized by G√©za Kasz√°s in the film A lovas√≠j√°sz (The horse archer), which premiered in January 2016.Kassai Lajos: A Lovas√≠j√°sz egy motiv√°ci√≥s film .  Achievements  To this day, he has won every single horse archery competition he entered. He set four Guinness world records: in 1998, by constantly riding on relay horses during a 12 hours competition, he rode through the 90 meter long horse archery range 286 times, and shot more than 1000 aimed arrows. In 2002, on a record run that lasted from 6 AM to 6 PM, he shot over 3000 shots collecting 7126.05 points in 323 rides, greatly surpassing his previous record. On 10 June 2006, he again surpassed his two previous 12-hour world records by competing in horse archery for 24 hours continuously. From Saturday 7 AM until Sunday 7 AM he rode 661 times shooting 5412 arrows and collecting 15,596.43 points overall, for an average of 212.35 points per ride. He set his last record with his disciples in the Budapest Sports Arena on 5 December 2009. He shot 12 thrown up discs with 30 cm diameter under 17.80 seconds from the back of a racing horse.

While the Los Angeles Kings awaited construction to be completed on their future home, The Forum in Inglewood, California, they played their first two games during their inaugural 1967‚Äì68 season at the Long Beach Arena. The first game in Kings history was played on Oct. 14, 1967 and the Kings defeated the fellow expansion Philadelphia Flyers 4‚Äì2 in front of 7,023. They also played 14 games at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena while awaiting the completion of the construction of the Forum. The Kings hosted their first game at the Forum on Dec. 30, 1967, a 2‚Äì0 loss to the Philadelphia Flyers. They went on to play their first 32 seasons at Forum before moving to the Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles in 1999. During the 1970s and early 1980s, the Kings had many years marked by impressive play in the regular season only to be washed out by early playoff exits. In 1988, the Kings traded with the Edmonton Oilers to get their captain Wayne Gretzky, leading to a successful phase of the franchise that raised hockey's popularity in Los Angeles. Gretzky, fellow Hall of Famer Luc Robitaille and defenseman Rob Blake led the Kings to the franchise's sole division title in 1990‚Äì91, and the Kings' first Stanley Cup Final in 1993, lost to the Montreal Canadiens. After the 1993 Finals, the Kings entered financial problems, with a bankruptcy in 1995 that was only solved with the acquisition by Philip Anschutz (owner of Anschutz Entertainment Group, operators of Staples Center) and Edward P. Roski. A period of mediocrity ensued, with the Kings only resurging as they broke a six-year playoff drought in the 2009‚Äì10 season, with a team that included goaltender Jonathan Quick, defenseman Drew Doughty, and forwards Dustin Brown, Anze Kopitar and Justin Williams. Under coach Darryl Sutter, who was hired early in the 2011‚Äì12 season, the Kings have won two Stanley Cups in three years: 2012, over the New Jersey Devils, and 2014, against the New York Rangers. Background and NHL expansion An exhibit at the Hockey Hall of Fame, showcasing the inaugural jerseys for the 1967 NHL expansion teams. The Kings used gold and purple colours on their jerseys until 1988. Prior to the Kings arrival in the Los Angeles area, both the Pacific Coast Hockey League (PCHL) and the Western Hockey League (WHL) had several teams in California, including the PCHL's Los Angeles Monarchs of the 1930s and the WHL's Los Angeles Blades of the 1960s. When the NHL decided to expand for the 1967‚Äì68 season amid rumblings that the WHL was proposing to turn itself into a major league and compete for the Stanley Cup, five separate Los Angeles groups bidded for a hockey franchise, including ones led by Buffalo Bills owner Ralph Wilson and Donna Reed's producer husband Tony Owen. Blades owner Dan Reeves, who was also proprietor of the National Football League's Los Angeles Rams, seemed the favorite for already having a team and a lease with the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. However, he would end up surpassed by Canadian entrepreneur Jack Kent Cooke, who owned the National Basketball Association's Los Angeles Lakers. As the Lakers played at the Memorial Sports Arena, Cooke applied for both a long-term NBA lease and the right to sign a lease for hockey in case he won the NHL franchise. But the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission, which managed the Sports Arena and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, had already entered into an agreement with the Blades, and only offered a two-year deal for the Lakers. Frustrated by his dealings with the Coliseum Commission, Cooke said, \\"I am going to build my own arena...I've had enough of this balderdash.\\" Thus he was the only Los Angeles applicant with plans for his own stadium, something that made the NHL favor his bid. In February 1966, Cooke was awarded one of the six new NHL expansion franchises, which also included the California Seals, Minnesota North Stars, Philadelphia Flyers, Pittsburgh Penguins and St. Louis Blues. Los Angeles has a large number of expatriates from both the Northeastern United States and Canada, which Cooke saw as a natural fan base. On July, Cooke purchased 29.4 acres of land in the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood to build his arena, The Forum. Combining the $2 million NHL expansion fee, a $1 million indemnity to the Blades for territorial rights, $4.02 million for the Forum terrain and $12.2 million for the building itself, Cooke spent $19 million to create the Kings, one of the most expensive expansion teams of the period. Following a contest to name the team, Cooke picked the name Kings, and chose the original team colors of purple (or \\"Forum Blue\\", as it was later officially called) and gold ‚Äì the same worn by the Lakers ‚Äì because they were colors traditionally associated with royalty. Prior to the 1967 NHL Expansion Draft, Cooke named Larry Regan the first general manager in franchise history, and struck a deal with Toronto Maple Leafs left winger Red Kelly, who was set for his retirement, to become the Kings' first head coach. Kelly's rights would be acquired during the expansion draft, but eventually Maple Leafs' general manager Punch Imlach decided to put him on the protected list and force Cooke to send one of his picks, Ken Block, in exchange for Kelly. Cooke also decided to improve the Kings' roster by purchasing the American Hockey League's Springfield Indians and promoting their best players. The \\"Forum Blue and Gold\\" years (1967‚Äì1975) The Forum in 1997. The venue served as the home arena for the Kings from 1967 to 1999. The Forum was not yet complete when the 1967‚Äì68 season began, so the Kings opened their first season at the Long Beach Arena in the neighboring city of Long Beach on October 14, 1967, defeating the Philadelphia Flyers 4‚Äì2. For the next two months, the Kings played their home games both at Long Beach and at the Sports Arena. The \\"Fabulous Forum\\" finally opened its doors on December 30, 1967, with the Kings being shut out by the Flyers, 2‚Äì0. The Kings made the Forum their home for the next 32 seasons. Players like Bill \\"Cowboy\\" Flett, Eddie \\"The Jet\\" Joyal, Eddie \\"The Entertainer\\" Shack and Real \\"Frenchy\\" Lemieux helped introduce the Los Angeles area to the NHL in the team's first few seasons. Such player nicknames were the brainchild of none other than Cooke himself. In their first season, the Kings finished in second place in the Western Division, just one point behind the Flyers. The Kings were the only expansion team that had a winning record at home, but were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Minnesota North Stars, losing the seventh game at The Forum on April 18, 1968, 9‚Äì4. In their second season behind Red Kelly, the Kings finished fourth in the West Division‚Äîthe final playoff berth. But after eliminating the Oakland Seals in the first round of the playoffs in seven games, the Kings were swept out of post-season play in the second round by the St. Louis Blues. After two fairly successful seasons, the Kings hit upon hard times, mostly due to poor management. Kings general managers established a history of trading away first-round draft picks, usually for veteran players (many of them NHL stars on the downside of their careers), a problem that would hinder the development of the franchise for years to come. The Kings' attendance also suffered during this time, leading Cooke to muse that the reason so many Northeasterners and Canadians moved to Southern California was that \\"they hated hockey.\\" In 1972, the Kings made two key acquisitions. First, the rise of rookie goaltender Ken Dryden in Montreal made goaltender Rogie Vachon expendable, and the Kings obtained him in a trade with the Canadiens on November 4, 1971. After years of a \\"revolving door\\" in goal, Vachon solidified the position, often in spectacular fashion. For the next five years, the Forum was often filled with chants of \\"Rogie!, Rogie!\\" as Vachon made many a great save. In addition, the Kings obtained former Toronto Maple Leafs winger Bob Pulford, first as a player and then as their head coach. Under Pulford's disciplined direction, the Kings went from being one of the worst defensive teams in the league to one of the best. It took him just two seasons to lead the Kings back to the playoffs and in 1974, they faced the Chicago Blackhawks, only to be eliminated in five games. Pulford eventually led the team to three of the most successful seasons in franchise history, including a 105-point season in 1974‚Äì75 that is still a franchise record. They finished second behind Montreal in the Norris Division, which was relatively strong compared to the other divisions. Also in 1975 that season, due to the growing number of teams, the NHL introduced a new playoff structure, including a best of three preliminary round to the playoffs for the bottom eight of the qualifying twelve teams (the winners of each division automatically receiving a berth into the next round). With the fourth-best record in the league, the Kings were heavy favorites against the Maple Leafs, who finished with 78 points. Despite winning game one at home in the Forum, the Kings lost game two in Toronto on April 10. Due to scheduling conflicts, and owner Jack Kent Cooke's refusal to play an afternoon game on April 12, game three was played at the Forum the next day, April 11, instead, giving each team less rest between the games. The Kings, having an older core of players that were jet-lagged from the cross country flight right before the game, simply did not have the energy due to lack of rest and recovery, and were upset in the deciding game at home 2‚Äì1 by the lowly but younger Maple Leafs. As Bob Miller said in his book, Tales from the Los Angeles Kings, \\"I'll never forget, with 10 seconds left, looking down from our broadcast location, seeing Toronto owner Harold Ballard and his sidekick King Clancy hugging and jumping up and down in the aisle as they eliminated the heavily favored Kings. It was such a disappointment after a tremendous season that Bob Pulford left the building in tears... because of Cooke's stubbornness the Kings' best season ever was wasted.\\" Marcel Dionne and the \\"Triple Crown Line\\" (1975‚Äì1988) After being eliminated in the first round of the playoffs in both 1973‚Äì74 and 1974‚Äì75, the Kings moved to significantly upgrade their offensive firepower when they acquired center Marcel Dionne on June 23, 1975, in a trade with the Detroit Red Wings. Dionne was already a superstar in the NHL and he made an immediate impact in the 1975‚Äì76 season, scoring 40 goals and adding 54 assists for 94 points in 80 regular season games. He led the Kings to a 38‚Äì33‚Äì9 record (85 points), earning them a second-place finish in the Norris Division. Behind Dionne's offensive prowess, the strong goaltending of Rogie Vachon, and the speed and scoring touch of forward Butch Goring, the Kings played two of their most thrilling seasons yet, with playoff match ups against the then-Atlanta Flames in the first round, and the Boston Bruins in the second round. In the 1976 playoffs, the Kings swept the Flames in two close games decided by one goal. When matched against the Bruins, the Kings were heavy underdogs against the big and powerful Bruins. Game one went just as predicted and Boston outmatched the Kings 4‚Äì0. Game two saw stellar goaltending by Vachon, who helped keep the game close until Goring shocked the Boston crowd with the overtime winner. The momentum stayed in game three on home ice with the Kings winning 6‚Äì4 thanks to Dionne's hat trick(three goals), which shocked the Bruins as they were now behind in a series they were predicted to sweep. Boston took control of games four and five by outscoring the Kings 10‚Äì1. When the Kings returned on home ice for game six, the Kings home crowd treated them to one of the loudest crowds ever heard at the Forum, a five-minute standing ovation that delayed the start of the game; players from both sides would later say they never saw anything like it. Boston would jump to a 3‚Äì1 lead into the final five minutes, but the Kings would come back thanks to two goals by Mike Corrigan, the tying goal scored after he was tripped by Boston goalie Gerry Cheevers, and still somehow swiped at the puck while lying on his stomach and put the puck into the net to tie the game. The comeback then was completed near the final minute of overtime thanks to Goring again, tying the series. However, Boston controlled game seven with a 3‚Äì0 shutout and won the series. In the first round of the 1977 playoffs, the Kings needed three games to defeat the Flames in the opening round, winning both games at home and losing on the road. In the second round, Boston controlled the first two games, and while the Kings put a better effort in game three, the Bruins still won 7‚Äì6 to go up three games to none. The Kings finally answered back in game four with a 7‚Äì4 win. Game five in Boston saw a game where the Kings were badly out-shot, but in the words of Boston goalie Gerry Cheevers, \\"Vachon did everything but stand on his head to make great save after great save.\\" The Kings ended up winning 3‚Äì1. Game six at home saw the Kings fall behind 3‚Äì0 only to tie the game in the third period, but the comeback would end on a sour note as Kings defenseman Dave Hutchison went to clear the puck on a Boston power play but broke his stick on the ice and turned the puck over; and Boston scored to win the game 4‚Äì3 and the series four games to two. Bob Pulford left the Kings after the 1976‚Äì77 season after constant feuding with then owner Jack Kent Cooke. Pulford wanted to become general manager as well as coach, or at least have a bigger role in player personnel decisions. Cooke however, often meddled in player personnel matters, which also caused another key component for the Kings, general manager Jake Milford, to leave as well and join the Vancouver Canucks. Now without Pulford and Milford, the Kings struggled in the 1977‚Äì78 season as they finished below .500 and were easily swept out of the first round by the Toronto Maple Leafs. Afterwards Vachon would become a free agent and sign with the Detroit Red Wings. On January 13, 1979, Kings coach Bob Berry tried juggling line combinations, and Dionne found himself on a new line with two young, mostly unknown players: second-year right winger Dave Taylor and left winger Charlie Simmer, who had been a career minor-leaguer. Each player benefited from each other, with Simmer being the gritty player who battled along the boards, Taylor being the play maker, and Dionne being the natural goal scorer. This line combination, known as the \\"Triple Crown Line\\", would go on to become one of the highest-scoring line combinations in NHL history. After the Triple Crown Line's first season together, Dr. Jerry Buss purchased the Kings, the Lakers, and the Forum for $67.5 million, but the Simmer-Dionne-Taylor combination remained intact. The next season, the Triple Crown Line dominated the NHL, scoring 146 goals and 182 assists, good for 328 points. But in the first round of the 1980 playoffs, they were eliminated in four games by upstart New York Islanders, who were on their way to winning their first of four straight Stanley Cups. Among the Islanders was Butch Goring, whom the Kings had traded late in the season for Billy Harris and Dave Lewis. In the 1980‚Äì81 season, the Triple Crown line did even better than the season before, scoring a total of 161 goals and 191 assists, good for 352 points. The entire line, along with goalie Mario Lessard, was selected to play in the 1981 NHL All-Star Game that season, which was played at the Forum. The Kings also had a remarkable regular season, finishing the 1980‚Äì81 season with an impressive 43 wins and 99 points, good for second in the Norris Division. But late in the season, setbacks came in as Charlie Simmer broke his leg, and was unable to play the rest of the season, and again, an impressive season was washed out by a first round upset, this time by the New York Rangers, who eliminated them in four games. The 1981‚Äì82 Kings saw the team slump to 17th overall and fourth in their division with 63 points, only making the playoffs due to being in the same division as the Colorado Rockies, who finished with 49 (in those days, the top four teams in each division were guaranteed a playoff berth). During that time, the team replaced head coach Bob Berry with assistant coach Parker MacDonald. After coaching 42 games, MacDonald resigned and retired, and was replaced by Don Perry, who just weeks into his tenure was suspended for six games for ordering enforcer Paul Mulvey to join a fight. The Kings opened the playoffs against the Edmonton Oilers, who were led by a young but fast-rising star by the name of Wayne Gretzky. Gretzky was only in his third year in the league, but he dominated the NHL like no other had before from the moment he stepped onto NHL ice in his rookie season. By the 1981‚Äì82 season, he was already the most dominant player in the league, and had made the Oilers one of the elite teams in the NHL, on their way to winning four Stanley Cup championships in the 1980s. The Oilers finished with 111 points. Few expected the Kings to stand a chance, but it was the Kings who won game one in Edmonton on April 7, 1982, 10‚Äì8, in the highest-scoring Stanley Cup Playoff game ever. The Oilers recovered to win in overtime in game two and the teams headed to Los Angeles for games three and four. Game three would be one of the most amazing in hockey history and was later dubbed the \\"Miracle on Manchester\\" (the Kings arena, the Forum, was on Manchester Boulevard). In that game, played on April 10, 1982, Gretzky led the Oilers to a commanding 5‚Äì0 lead after two periods and it seemed like the Kings were headed for a blowout loss. But the Kings began an unbelievable comeback in the third period, scoring four goals and finally tying the game on a goal by left winger Steve Bozek at 19:55 of the third period and sending the game into overtime. Bozek's goal set the stage for what was to come. At 2:35 of the overtime period, Kings left winger Daryl Evans fired a slap shot off a face-off in the right circle of the Edmonton zone, passing Oilers goaltender Grant Fuhr over his right shoulder to give the Kings an incredible come-from-behind, overtime victory, 6‚Äì5. The Miracle on Manchester, the greatest comeback in NHL playoff history, is also the greatest moment in Kings franchise history as of 2007. Not only did the Kings complete a miraculous comeback against the vaunted Oilers, but they also went on to eliminate them from the playoffs in five games, winning the decider in Edmonton, 7‚Äì4, however the Kings would lose in the next round to the Vancouver Canucks in five games. Despite Dionne's leadership, the Kings missed the playoffs in the next two seasons. On January 30, 1984, Rogie Vachon became general manager of the Kings. During the 1983‚Äì84 season, he coached the team for two games in 1984 after replacing Don Perry and Roger Neilson coached the team's final 28 games. After the season the team named Pat Quinn head coach. But the Kings were quickly swept out of the playoffs by the Oilers in 1984‚Äì85, when the Oilers won their second-straight Stanley Cup championship. Vachon also became the first player in team history to have his jersey retired on February 14, 1985. Dionne's time with the Kings ended on March 10, 1987, when he was traded to the New York Rangers. By this time, the Kings had new skaters to help lead them into the next decade, including star forwards Bernie Nicholls, Jimmy Carson, Luc Robitaille, and defenseman Steve Duchesne. Even before the Dionne trade, the Kings were sent reeling when coach Pat Quinn signed a contract to become coach and general manager of the Vancouver Canucks with just months left on his Kings contract. NHL President John Ziegler suspended Quinn for the rest of the season and barred him from taking over Vancouver's hockey operations until June. Ziegler also barred him from coaching anywhere in the NHL until the 1990‚Äì91 season. In Ziegler's view, Quinn's actions created a serious conflict of interest that could only be resolved by having him removed as coach. Despite these shocks, Mike Murphy who played thirteen season with the Kings and was their captain for seven years, replaced Quinn as coach. The Kings made the playoffs in the next two seasons, but they were unable to get out of the first round. After a slow start to the 1987‚Äì88 season, Murphy was fired and Vachon coached the team for one game until promoting AHL's New Haven Nighthawks coach Robbie Ftorek as new head coach. Part of the problem was that the way the playoffs were structured (teams were bracketed and seeded by division) made it very likely that they would have to get past either the powerful Oilers or Calgary Flames (or both) to reach the Conference Finals. In all, the Kings faced either the Oilers or the Flames in the playoffs four times during the 1980s. For most of the 1980s, the Kings struggled at the box office. The league's 1981 realignment and the departure of the Colorado Rockies in 1982 left the Kings not only as the only U.S. team west and south of St. Louis, but also as the only American team in its division. Frequent visits from teams hailing from relatively unknown cities on the Canadian Prairie Provinces made marketing the team extremely difficult, even when it was relatively competitive on the ice. By 1983, the Kings' off ice woes were so bad that the team was one of the few U.S. teams to seriously consider supporting the audacious bid of flamboyant Saskatchewan businessman Bill Hunter to move the St. Louis Blues to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, presumably on the assumption that the Kings would have switched divisions with Hunter's team and thus joined the mostly American Norris Division. Ultimately, once it became obvious Hunter's bid had no chance of gaining approval, the Kings voted with most of the league against that proposal. However, the 1988‚Äì89 season would be a big turning point for the franchise. McNall brings Gretzky to LA (1988‚Äì1996) Statue of Wayne Gretzky outside the Staples Center. Gretzky played with the Kings from 1988 to 1996. In 1987, coin collector Bruce McNall purchased the Kings from Buss and turned the team into a Stanley Cup contender almost overnight. On August 9, 1988, McNall acquired the league's best player, Wayne Gretzky, in a blockbuster trade with the Edmonton Oilers. The trade rocked the hockey world, especially north of the border where Canadians mourned the loss of a player they considered a national treasure. McNall changed the team colors to silver and black. In Gretzky's first season with the Kings, he led the team in scoring with 168 points on 54 goals and 114 assists, and won his ninth Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's Most Valuable Player. He led the Kings to a second- place finish in the Smythe Division with a 42‚Äì31‚Äì7 record (91 points), and they ranked fourth in the NHL overall. The Kings faced Gretzky's old team, the Oilers, in the first round of the 1989 playoffs. They fell behind three games to one, but rallied to take the series in seven games, helped in no small part by nine goals from Chris Kontos, a little-known player who had just recently been called up from the minor leagues. However, the Kings were quickly swept out of the playoffs in the second round by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Flames. Gretzky also had a clash and feuded with his first Kings head coach Robbie Ftorek. At season's end, Ftorek was fired and was replaced by Tom Webster. The next season saw Gretzky become the league's all-time leading scorer. On October 15, 1989, in Edmonton, he assisted on a Bernie Nicholls goal to tie Gordie Howe's career record of 1,850 points, then broke it late in the contest on a game-tying goal against Bill Ranford. The goal forced overtime, where Gretzky capped a spectacular night by scoring again to win the game for Los Angeles. At season's end, the Kings finished fourth and faced the defending champion Flames in the first round. This time, they defeated Calgary in six games, two of which had dramatic overtimes ‚Äî game three was won with a short-handed goal by Tony Granato and game six ended with a strange goal by Mike Krushelnyski while he was flat on his back. However, the Kings were swept in the second round by the eventual champion Oilers, who were seeking revenge for the loss of the previous year. Gretzky spearheaded the Kings to their first regular-season division title in franchise history in the 1990‚Äì91 season with a 46‚Äì24‚Äì10 record (102 points, the second-best point total in franchise history). Notably, it was the first time in ten years that a team from Alberta had not finished first in the Smythe. However, the heavily favored Kings struggled in the playoffs, winning the first round against the Vancouver Canucks in six games but losing a close series against Edmonton in the second round that saw four games go into overtime. The 1991‚Äì92 season, the Kings' 25th as a franchise, witnessed seven Kings players score over twenty goals; Gretzky, who missed the first month of the season due to a back injury suffered from the 1991 Canada Cup,had a then-career low in scoring yet had the most assists in the league and finished third in points behind Pittsburgh Penguins stars Mario Lemieux and Kevin Stevens; Gretzky was also reunited with his former Edmonton Oiler teammates Jari Kurri, Paul Coffey, and Charlie Huddy. Despite the reunion, Los Angeles again failed to thwart their Edmonton rivals in the post-season, losing to them in a six game upset. This marked the third-straight year that the Gretzky-led Kings were eliminated from the playoffs by Gretzky's former teammates, and at the end of the season, Tom Webster was relieved from head coach, and general manager Rogie Vachon was moved to a different position in the organization and named Nick Beverley as his successor. Beverley hired coach Barry Melrose, then at the Adirondack Red Wings. Gretzky and the Kings had generated excitement about hockey and the NHL that had never been seen before in Southern California. As soon as Gretzky donned a Kings jersey, the Forum was sold out for every game--virtually overnight, a Kings game became the hottest ticket in town. The popularity of Gretzky and the Kings also led to the NHL awarding an expansion team to Anaheim, California in 1993; the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim (later renamed to Anaheim Ducks in 2006) would become the Kings nearest rival, just 35 miles to the south. Gretzky's popularity in Southern California also led to the NHL expanding or moving into other Sun Belt cities such as Dallas, Phoenix, Tampa, Miami and Nashville. =First trip to the Stanley Cup Final (1992‚Äì1993)= The Kings would reach new heights in the 1992‚Äì93 season, but the season started badly when it was learned that Gretzky had suffered a career-threatening herniated thoracic disk before the season began. But even without their captain and leading scorer, the Kings got off to a 20‚Äì8‚Äì3 start, led by Luc Robitaille, who filled in as captain as Gretzky missed the Kings' first 39 games. Although Gretzky came back to score 16 goals and 49 assists, good for 65 points in just 45 games, Robitaille still lead the team's scoring with 63 goals and 62 assists (125 points) in 84 regular season games, setting new NHL all-time records for goals and points scored by a left winger in a single season. The Kings finished with a 39‚Äì35‚Äì10 record (88 points), clinching third place in the Smythe Division. The 1993 playoffs began with the Kings' offense in full force, scoring 33 goals as they beat the Flames 4‚Äì2.Sadowski (1993), p. 145 In the second round, the Kings faced the heavily favored Vancouver Canucks, a team that had beaten the Kings seven times in nine games during the regular season, and had not lost to the Kings in their four meetings in Vancouver. But the Kings would go on to eliminate the Canucks in six games, with the pivotal victory coming in Game 5 at Vancouver, where the Kings took the series lead as winger Gary Shuchuk scored at 6:31 of the second overtime period. In the Campbell Conference Finals, the Kings were even more of an underdog against the Doug Gilmour-led Toronto Maple Leafs. After winning Game 5 on overtime, the Leafs had a chance to eliminate the Kings at The Forum. Game 6 had the Kings open 4‚Äì2 before Leafs captain Wendel Clark scored twice in the third period to force overtime. During extra time, Robitaille assisted on Gretzky's goal to give his team a dramatic 5‚Äì4 victory and force a game 7 at Maple Leaf Gardens. The game was not without controversy, however. Just prior to the winning goal, Gretzky clipped Gilmour in the face with his stick, but referee Kerry Fraser did not call a penalty, allowing Gretzky to score the winning goal moments later. In the final contest, Gretzky scored a hat trick (three goals) and had an assist to lead the Kings to a 5‚Äì4 win and a berth in the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in franchise history. In the Stanley Cup Finals, the Kings faced the Montreal Canadiens. After winning the opening match 4‚Äì1, the Kings suffered a turnaround during Game 2. Late in the contest, with the Kings leading by a score of 2‚Äì1, Canadiens coach Jacques Demers requested a measurement of Kings defenseman Marty McSorley's stick blade. His suspicions proved to be correct, as the curve of blade was too great, and McSorley was penalized. The Canadiens pulled their goalie, Patrick Roy, giving them a two-man advantage, and Eric Desjardins scored on the resulting power play to tie the game. Montreal went on to win the game in overtime on another goal by Desjardins, and the Kings never recovered. They dropped the next two games in overtime, and lost Game 5, 4‚Äì1, giving the Canadiens the 24th Stanley Cup in franchise history. Bankruptcy and decline (1993‚Äì1997) The next chapter after the 1993 playoff run for the Kings was tough for Kings fans. Wayne Gretzky returned to his All-Star form for the 1993‚Äì94 season, and continued to lead the team with 38 goals and 92 assists for 130 points, winning his final Art Ross Trophy as the league's leader in points that season. On March 23, 1994, Gretzky surpassed Gordie Howe's NHL record for goals and became the all-time NHL leader in goals, assists and points. But despite Gretzky's leadership, and the individual efforts by Robitaille, Kurri and Blake, the Kings never recovered from a sluggish November and December and slumped to fifth place in the Pacific Division with only 66 points. They missed the playoffs for the first time since 1986. To add insult to injury, their newly established cross-freeway rivals, the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, finished ahead of them in their division, and their cross-state rivals the San Jose Sharks advanced to the second round in their first post-season appearance by upsetting the upstart Detroit Red Wings. By 1992, Bruce McNall was elected chairman of the NHL's board of governors, the second-most powerful post in the league. His support of Gary Bettman tipped the scales in favor of Bettman's election as the league's first commissioner. However, in December 1993, McNall defaulted on a loan from Bank of America, who threatened to force the Kings into bankruptcy unless he sold the team. McNall sold the team to IDB Communications founder Jeffrey Sudikoff and former Madison Square Garden president Joseph Cohen in the wake of a federal investigation into his financial practices. He also resigned from his position on the NHL board of governors. He ultimately pleaded guilty to five counts of conspiracy and fraud, and admitted to obtaining $236 million in fraudulent loans from six banks over ten years. It later emerged that McNall's free-spending ways put the Kings in serious financial trouble. At one point, Cohen and Sudikoff were even unable to meet player payroll, and were ultimately forced into bankruptcy in 1995. They were forced to trade many of their stronger players: Tomas Sandstrom would be traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins for the return of McSorley (who had been traded to Pittsburgh before the beginning of the 1993‚Äì94 season), and Luc Robitaille would be traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1994 for Rick Tocchet; in 1995, key defensemen Alexei Zhitnik and Charlie Huddy would be sent to Buffalo for several lowly players and an aging Grant Fuhr. While the Kings still had some talent on their roster in the forms of Gretzky, Blake, Kurri and McSorley, they had little else. Before the lockout- shortened 1994‚Äì95 season, general manager Nick Beverley left the Kings to work as a scout for the Toronto Maple Leafs and his replacement was Sam McMaster. However, the team continued to stumble, and a late season cold streak hindered their playoff chances, putting the Kings within one game of clinching the 8th playoff spot, but they lost their final game to the Blackhawks 5‚Äì1 to finish in ninth place with 41 points, one point under the eighth place Dallas Stars. During that time, the Kings fired Barry Melrose, leaving Rogie Vachon to coach the team's final seven games in the 1994‚Äì95 season. After the season, Larry Robinson who played three seasons for the Kings from 1989 to 1992, was named head coach after winning the 1995 Stanley Cup as an assistant coach with the New Jersey Devils. On October 6, 1995, one day before the 1995‚Äì96 season opener, the bankruptcy court approved the purchase of the Kings by Phillip Anschutz and Edward P. Roski for $113.5 million. Larry Robinson's first season as the Kings coach saw the Kings slump even further to sixth place in the Pacific Division with only 66 points. Marking the first step of a rebuilding phase, Gretzky requested a traded for legitimate Stanley Cup contender, for another chance to win a title before retirement. On February 27, 1996, Gretzky was traded to the St. Louis Blues, for forwards Craig Johnson, Patrice Tardif, Roman Vopat, a first-round pick in the 1997 draft (Matt Zultek) and a fifth- round choice in the 1996 draft (Peter Hogan). None became stars for the Kings. Shortly after Gretzky was traded, Rob Blake was named team captain, and the Kings then traded Marty McSorley, Jari Kurri and Shane Churla to the New York Rangers for Mattias Norstrom, Nathan LaFayette, Ian Laperriere, Ray Ferraro, and a draft pick. The oft-maligned general manager Sam McMaster was fired and replaced by former Kings winger Dave Taylor. But the rebuilding phase for Taylor was a tough one, as the Kings suffered one more forgettable season in 1996‚Äì97. Playoff contention years, and the move to Staples Center (1997‚Äì2002) In the 1997‚Äì98 season, the Kings finish second in the Pacific Division with 87 Points. They were led by strong players Jozef Stumpel and Glen Murray, and Blake also became the first (and, as of today, the only) Kings defensemen to win the James Norris Trophy as the NHL's best defenseman after recording a career-high 23 goals and 50 points. Luc Robitaille would also return, though he would be plagued by injuries throughout the season. The Kings were matched against the highly skilled St. Louis Blues, and after losing the first two games on the road, had a chance to bring life back to the Kings for game three. Leading 3‚Äì0 in the third with 11:28 left, Blues forward Geoff Courtnall charged into Kings goalie Jamie Storr while Storr was out playing the puck, in immediate response, Kings defenseman Sean O'Donnell viciously attacked Courtnall from behind, resulting in a five-minute major penalty for O'Donnell and power play for St. Louis. The Blues rallied and scored four goals in the next three minutes and seven seconds during the power play to win game three 4‚Äì3, and then won game four 2‚Äì1 to sweep the Kings. The Kings suffered though an 1998‚Äì99 injury-plagued season as they finished last in the Pacific Division and missed the playoffs with a 32-45-5 record. Despite this, Robitaille would return to his all-star form. This was their final season at the Great Western Forum, (Due to the fact that the Great Western Bank ceased to exist two seasons prior, the arena name was replaced by the team name on center ice). Head coach Larry Robinson was fired afterwards. Taylor turned to Andy Murray, who became the Kings' 19th head coach on June 14, 1999. Taylor's hiring of Murray was immediately criticized by media across North America because of Murray's perceived lack of experience ‚Äî up to that point, his only head coaching experience had been at the international level with the Canadian National Team and at the US high school level. Indeed, Taylor took a gamble on Murray, hoping it would pay off. But Taylor was not finished dealing that summer. Shortly after hiring Murray, Taylor acquired star right-wing Zigmund Palffy and veteran center Bryan Smolinski on June 20, 1999, in exchange for center prospect Olli Jokinen, winger prospect Josh Green, defenseman prospect Mathieu Biron and the Kings' first-round pick in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft. The Kings moved into the Staples Center in 1999. The Kings, along with the Los Angeles Lakers, made an even bigger move in 1999, as they left The Forum, after 32 seasons, and moved to the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles, which was built by Anschutz and Roski. Staples Center was a state-of-the-art arena, complete with luxury suites and all the modern amenities that fans and athletes would want in a brand-new facility. With a new home, a new coach, a potential 50-goal scorer in the fold and players such as Rob Blake, Luc Robitaille, Glen Murray, Jozef Stumpel, Donald Audette, Ian Laperriere and Mattias Norstrom, the Kings improved dramatically, finishing the season the 1999‚Äì2000 season with a 39‚Äì31‚Äì12‚Äì4 record (94 points), good for second place in the Pacific Division. But in the 2000 playoffs, the Kings were again eliminated in the first round, this time by the Detroit Red Wings in a four-game sweep. In the 2000 NHL Entry Draft, the Kings drafted in the first round Alexander Frolov with the 20th-overall pick and in the fourth round drafted Lubomir Visnovsky 118th overall. The 2000‚Äì01 season was a controversial one, as fans began to question AEG's commitment to the success of the Kings because they failed to significantly improve the team during the off-season. Adding fuel to the fire was the February 21, 2001, trade of star defenseman and fan favorite Rob Blake. In that deal, the Kings sent Blake and center Steven Reinprecht, to the Colorado Avalanche in exchange for right wing Adam Deadmarsh, defenseman Aaron Miller, center prospect Jared Aulin and a first-round pick in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft (Dave Steckel). After Blake's departure, Mattias Norstrom became the Kings' thirteenth captain, then the Kings acquired goaltender Felix Potvin from the Vancouver Canucks; Deadmarsh and Miller became impact players for the Kings, who finished the 2000‚Äì01 season with a 38‚Äì28‚Äì13‚Äì3 record (92 points), good for a third-place finish in the Pacific Division and another first-round playoff date with the Detroit Red Wings. The heavily favored Red Wings ‚Äî many predicted another four-game sweep ‚Äî made easy work of the Kings in games one and two at the Joe Louis Arena, but the Kings got back in the series with a 2‚Äì1 win in game three at Staples Center. In game four, the Red Wings took a commanding 3‚Äì0 lead after two periods. This set the stage for yet another unbelievable playoff comeback for the Kings, highly reminiscent of the \\"Miracle on Manchester\\", back in 1982. Seldom-used forward Scott Thomas, a career minor-leaguer, scored a power play goal at 13:53. The Red Wings were called for a penalty with just under three minutes to play and Kings' coach Andy Murray gambled and pulled his goalie to give his team a two-man advantage. The gamble paid off as Jozef Stumpel would follow with another power play goal at 17:33. Finally, Bryan Smolinski tied the game at the 19:07 mark. In the overtime, Deadmarsh stole the puck from Red Wings' star defenseman Chris Chelios in the right corner behind the Detroit net, and threw a centering pass to center √âric Belanger, who scored the game- winning goal at 2:36 to lift the Kings to a miraculous come-from-behind win, now known as the \\"Frenzy on Figueroa\\", or the \\"Stunner at Staples.\\"Miller (2006), pp. 169‚Äì172 That win would help the Kings eliminate the Red Wings in game six by winning four straight games after going down 2‚Äì0 in the series. It was the Kings' first playoff series win since 1993. In the second round, the Kings went up against another elite team, the Colorado Avalanche, led by superstars Joe Sakic, Peter Forsberg, Patrick Roy, Ray Bourque, playing in his last NHL season, and former teammate Rob Blake. The Kings won game one by a score of 4‚Äì3 in overtime, but then lost the next three games. Down three games to one and facing elimination, the Kings bounced back with two 1‚Äì0 shut-out victories, including the most memorable game of that series being game six where goalies Patrick Roy of Colorado and Felix Potvin of the Kings battled to a 0‚Äì0 tie after regulation and into the second overtime; finally after 64 shots on goal that were saved between both goalies, a slap shot by Kings Glen Murray found the back of the net for the win and thus tied the series. Game seven saw a 1‚Äì1 tie after two periods, however Colorado dominated the third period with four unanswered goals to win the game 5‚Äì1 and the series. Colorado would eventually win the Stanley Cup that year. Afterwards, during the off- season, Luc Robitaille turn down a one-year deal with a substantial pay cut and ended up signing with Detroit, as the Red Wings represented his best chance at winning the Stanley Cup, and like Tomas Sandstrom before him in 1997, Robitaille won the Stanley Cup with Detroit in 2002. The 2001‚Äì02 season started off with tragedy as team scouts Garnet \\"Ace\\" Bailey and Mark Bavis were both casualties of the September 11th attack. The team honored the two by wearing \\"AM\\" patches on their jerseys. The Kings drafted Michael Cammalleri 49th-overall in the second round of the 2001 NHL Draft. Earlier in the season, the team acquired Jason Allison who was involved in a contract dispute along with Mikko Eloranta from the Boston Bruins in return for Jozef Stumpel and Glen Murray. At mid-season they hosted the 2002 NHL All-Star Game, the last NHL All-Star game that used the North America vs. the World All-Star format, where the Kings were represented by Zigmund Pallfy and star defenseman Jaroslav Modry on the World team. Jason Allison, Palffy and Adam Deadmarsh would form another thrilling scoring line nicknamed the \\"L.A.P.D. Line\\" (combining the three initials of Allison, Palffy and Deadmarsh, with a reference to the Los Angeles Police Department), highly reminiscent of the Triple Crown Line of old. While not as successful scoring-wise, they still led the team with a combination of 80 goals, and 115 assists, a total of 195 points. The Kings started off the season with a sluggish October and November, and then found their game again to finish with 95 points. They in fact were tied in points with the second place Phoenix Coyotes, and only finished third in the Pacific Division and seventh in the West due to a goals-for differential‚Äîthe Coyotes having 228 and the Kings having 214 as a team. In the playoffs they met the Colorado Avalanche again, this time in the first round. The series would prove to be a carbon copy of their previous meeting, with the Kings behind three games to one and bouncing back to tie the series, only to be dominated in the seventh game and eliminated. Rebuilding (2002‚Äì2009) The next two seasons would be major disappointments as the Kings hit another major decline. While Zigmund Palffy led the team in scoring with 85 points in the 2002‚Äì03 season, his two L.A.P.D. linemates, Jason Allison and Adam Deadmarsh, both suffered concussions and missed the majority of the season. Despite being at 15‚Äì10‚Äì4‚Äì3 in mid-December, the Kings lost 14 of their next 19 games and never recovered. They eventually finished the season tenth in the West and missed the 2003 playoffs. During the subsequent off-season, Luc Robitaille returned to the Kings after two seasons with the Detroit Red Wings, and would go on to lead the team in scoring for the 2003‚Äì04 season. However, Palffy suffered shoulder injuries of his own and sat out the majority of the season, while his two L.A.P.D. linemates sat out the entire season, with Deadmarsh later retiring after the 2004‚Äì05 NHL lockout and Allison playing one last season with the Toronto Maple Leafs before ultimately retiring. With a record of 28‚Äì20‚Äì16‚Äì7 and 81 points and 11 games left in the season, the Kings looked to be in contention for the 2004 playoffs, and Head Coach Andy Murray was just one win away from becoming the most winningest coach in franchise history. Los Angeles, however, lost all 11 remaining games, squandering their playoff chances and Murray's opportunity at Kings history. Statistically, for the 2002‚Äì03 season, the Kings lost a franchise-record 536 man-games (number of games missed by individual players) due to injury; in comparison, for the 2003‚Äì04 season, they broke a previous NHL record with 629 man-games lost to injury. Pavol Demitra with the Kings, December 2005. The Kings signed Demitra as a free agent in the 2005. The team drafted Dustin Brown with the 13th overall pick in the first round of the 2003 NHL Entry Draft. Following the resumption of play after the 2004‚Äì05 NHL lockout, the Kings drafted Anze Kopitar with the 11th pick in 2005 and goaltender Jonathan Quick in the third round, 72nd overall. In free agency, the team acquired Valeri Bure, Craig Conroy, Jeremy Roenick and Pavol Demitra for the 2005‚Äì06 season. The Kings also had young talented forwards with Alexander Frolov, Michael Cammalleri and Dustin Brown, as well as strong offensive prowess from defenseman Lubomir Visnovsky, who led the team in points. The first game of the 2005‚Äì06 season, in which the Kings jumped to a 4‚Äì0 lead only to let it slip away in a 5‚Äì4 loss to the Dallas Stars, would ultimately forecast how the remainder of the season would progress; Los Angeles began the season strongly, but the campaign's second half saw the team stumble, free-falling from second place in the Western Conference in early January to seventh place by the Olympic break in the middle of February. While the Kings still looked to be in contention for the 2006 playoffs, injuries again played a factor during and after the 2006 Winter Olympics, of which the Kings had six players representing. Defensemen Mattias Norstrom and Aaron Miller suffering from a concussion and a back injury, respectively, prevented the two from even participating in the Games; Frolov separated his shoulder during a round robin game and missed ten games after, and the Kings' leading goal-scorer, Pavol Demitra, missed six games after being struck in the face with a puck in the tournament quarterfinals. Afterwards, the Kings lost 12 of their remaining 22 games left in the season, and eventually finished tenth in the West. On March 21, 2006, the team fired Head Coach Andy Murray, replacing him on an interim basis with John Torchetti. With three games left in the season, Luc Robitaille, the team's all-time leading scorer and the NHL's all-time highest-scoring left winger, announced that, at the end of the year, he would retire. Just one day after the end of the Kings' 2005‚Äì06 regular season, AEG decided to clean house. On April 18, 2006, President of Hockey Operations and General Manager Dave Taylor and Director of Player Personnel Bill O'Flaherty were relieved of their duties, and Vice President and Assistant General Manager Kevin Gilmore was reassigned to other duties within AEG. Interim Head Coach John Torchetti and assistant coaches Mark Hardy and Ray Bennett, along with Goaltending Consultant Andy Nowicki, were also fired. Tim Leiweke also announced that he would no longer serve in his role as chief executive officer (CEO). Marc Crawford in June 2006, a month after he was named the head coach for the Kings. On April 21, 2006, the Kings hired Philadelphia Flyers scout and former San Jose Sharks general manager Dean Lombardi as president and general manager, signing him to a five-year contract. Soon after he was hired, Lombardi quickly began to revamp the Kings' hockey operations and just barely over one month into his tenure, on May 22, 2006, he hired Marc Crawford to be the Kings' 21st head coach. In the 2006 off-season, Roenick signed with the Phoenix Coyotes; Bure, who didn't play the 2005‚Äì06 season due to injuries, retired; and Demitra was traded to the Minnesota Wild in exchange for Patrick O'Sullivan and Trevor Lewis. Additionally, Lombardi acquired the rights to Jack Johnson, along with Oleg Tverdovsky, from the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for Tim Gleason and Eric Belanger. Via free agency, Rob Blake returned to the Kings. There were few highlights during the 2006‚Äì07 season, where the Kings had their worst performance in a decade with 68 points and finishing as the second-to-last in the West by finishing the season beating the conference's worst, the Coyotes. On January 13, 2007, the Kings made hockey history by putting Yutaka Fukufuji in goal for the third period of a game with the St. Louis Blues. This marked the first time in hockey history that a Japanese-born player played in an NHL regular season game. On January 20, 2007, the Kings retired Luc Robitaille's jersey in an hour-long ceremony prior to a game with the Phoenix Coyotes. It was the fifth Kings jersey to be retired. Before the 2007‚Äì08 season, the Kings selected Wayne Simmonds 61st overall, Alec Martinez 95th overall and Dwight King 109th overall at the 2007 NHL Entry Draft, also signing six unrestricted free agents ‚Äî center Michal Handzus, left wingers Ladislav Nagy and Kyle Calder and defensemen Tom Preissing, Brad Stuart and Jon Klemm. Rob Blake was then named the team's 14th captain after longtime captain Mattias Norstrom was traded to the Dallas Stars in February 2007. However, despite opening the season with a win against the defending Stanley Cup champion Anaheim Ducks in the first NHL regular season game in Europe at the O2 Arena (also owned by AEG) in London, England, the new acquisitions did little to change the Kings' fortunes, as the team finished with the second-worst record in the league. On June 10, 2008, shortly after the end of the season, Los Angeles announced the firing of Head Coach Marc Crawford. Kings' centre, Anze Kopitar, prepares to take the face off at the 2007 NHL Premiere in London. During the 2008 NHL Entry Draft, the Kings had a busy day, starting with a three-way trade with the Calgary Flames and the Anaheim Ducks ‚Äî the Kings traded Michael Cammalleri to the Flames and their 28th overall pick to the Ducks. In return, the Kings received the 12th overall pick, which was then later traded to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for the 13th pick. During the Draft itself, Los Angeles used their second-overall pick to select defenseman Drew Doughty, the 13th pick to select Colten Teubert and the 32nd pick to select Slava Voynov. Later on during the 2008 off-season, the Kings traded Lubomir Visnovsky to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for Matt Greene and Jarret Stoll and, after Rob Blake left for the San Jose Sharks, the team brought back Sean O'Donnell via a trade with the Anaheim Ducks. Drew Doughty during his inaugural season with the Kings, April 2009. He was drafted by the Kings 13th overall in the 2008 Draft. On July 17, 2008, the Kings hired Terry Murray to become the 22nd head coach in franchise history. Shortly before the commencement of the 2008‚Äì09 season, on October 8, 2008, Dustin Brown was named the Kings' 15th captain in franchise history. Brown, at just 23 years of age, became both the youngest captain and the first American-born captain in Kings' history. Late into the season, in March 2009, Los Angeles acquired Justin Williams from the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for Patrick O'Sullivan. While the 2008‚Äì09 Kings still finished last in the Pacific Division and 14th overall in the Western Conference, the 79 points they finished with was seen as an improvement, compared to their two previous seasons of 68 and 71 points, respectively. Return to the playoffs (2009‚Äì2014) During the 2009 off-season, the Kings traded for forward Ryan Smyth, known for his prowess in front of opposing goaltenders. They also signed defenseman Rob Scuderi, who won the Stanley Cup the previous year with the Pittsburgh Penguins, and drafted Brayden Schenn in the first round, fifth overall; Kyle Clifford in the second round, 35th overall; and Jordan Nolan, the son of NHL coach Ted Nolan in the seventh round, 186th overall at the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. Kings score a goal against the Vancouver Canucks in the first round of the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs. The Kings were very successful during the 2009‚Äì10 season, finishing sixth overall in the West despite being in the midst of a rebuild. They established a franchise record with a nine-game unbeaten streak, and finished the season with 101 points, just the third 100-plus point season in franchise history. However, they lost to a highly skilled Vancouver Canucks team in six games in the Western Conference Quarterfinals. The Kings initially led the series two games to one, and were ahead 3‚Äì2 after the second period of Game 4 only to let the game slip away in part due to excellent goaltending by Roberto Luongo and late goals by Henrik and Daniel Sedin. The Canucks would then easily win the next two games to eliminate the Kings. Despite the series loss, many considered the season to be an outright success due to the age of the team and the setbacks from injuries to key players Ryan Smyth and Justin Williams. Forward Anze Kopitar spent most of the first half of the season in the top ten in the league in scoring, ultimately finishing 20th overall in points. Drew Doughty was one of three finalists for the James Norris Memorial Trophy as the league's top defenseman and also received the King's Best Defenseman award. The season marked the first time in eight years that the Kings made it to the playoffs. During the 2010 off-season, the Kings signed veteran and former Vancouver on-ice captain Willie Mitchell, as well as adding forward Alexei Ponikarovsky after losing out on the controversial free agent signing of Ilya Kovalchuk. Mitchell's signing created a top defensive pairing along with Norris Trophy favorite Drew Doughty and bolstered the chemistry of the locker room after the departure of veterans Sean O'Donnell and Alexander Frolov, in the trade deadline, the team acquired Dustin Penner from the Edmonton Oilers for Colten Teubert, a first-round pick in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft, and a conditional second-round pick in 2012. The Kings entered the 2011 playoffs as the seventh seed in the West and played San Jose in the first round. Unfortunately, there were more setbacks as the team's high scorer, Anze Kopitar, was injured and unavailable for the playoffs. On the road, the Sharks would win Game 1 in overtime, 3‚Äì2, whereupon the Kings responded with a 4‚Äì0 shut-out in Game 2. On home ice for Game 3, the momentum for the Kings appeared to continue as they jumped to an early 4‚Äì0 lead, only to let it slip away as the Sharks fought back and eventually won the game in overtime, 6‚Äì5. The Sharks then made easy work of the Kings in the next game, prevailing 6‚Äì3. Facing elimination, the Kings won Game 5 3‚Äì1 on the road, and kept the score a tie by the end of regulation in Game 6 at home, though failing capitalize on a five-minute power-play late in the game up to overtime would prove to be the fatal blow, as moments after the Sharks' penalty finished, Joe Thornton would win the game 4‚Äì3 for San Jose, thereby eliminating the Kings. =First Stanley Cup victory (2011‚Äì2012)= In the 2011 off-season, the Kings acquired Mike Richards and prospect Rob Bordson from the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for Wayne Simmonds, Brayden Schenn and a 2012 second-round pick. By personal request, the team also traded Ryan Smyth back to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for Colin Fraser and a seventh-round pick in 2012. The club then signed Simon Gagne from the Tampa Bay Lightning to play alongside former Philadelphia Flyer teammate Mike Richards. Darryl Sutter in 2014. Sutter was named as the Kings head coach in December 2011. The Kings began the 2011‚Äì12 season with a 5‚Äì1‚Äì1 record in their first seven games, but went 8‚Äì11‚Äì3 over the next 22, resulting in a 13‚Äì12‚Äì4 overall record after the first 29 games. This resulted in coach Terry Murray being fired. He was replaced on an interim basis by John Stevens for four games before on December 17, 2011, the team hired Darryl Sutter as their new head coach. Before the trade deadline, the Kings acquired another former Philadelphia Flyer in Richards' friend and former teammate Jeff Carter from the Columbus Blue Jackets for Jack Johnson and a conditional first-round draft pick. The Kings were much improved under Sutter, going 25‚Äì13‚Äì11. They also narrowly missed clinching their second divisional title in franchise history. The Kings lost both of their final two games to the San Jose Sharks in overtime, allowing San Jose to edge them out by one point for the seventh seed in the Western Conference, while a five-game winning streak gave the Phoenix Coyotes their first Pacific Division championship. The Kings settled for the eighth seed, having rounded out the season with a 40‚Äì27‚Äì15 record for 95 points. The Kings then headed into the 2012 playoffs against the Presidents' Trophy-winning Vancouver Canucks. After playing two games in Vancouver and one in Los Angeles, the Kings were up 3‚Äì0 in the series, a franchise first. By winning Game 5 in Vancouver, the Kings advanced to the Conference Semifinals for the first time since the 2000‚Äì01 season, whereupon they swept the second-seeded St. Louis Blues, advancing to the Western Conference Finals for only the second time in franchise history. In doing so, the Kings also became the first NHL team to enter the playoffs as the eighth seed and eliminate the first- and second-seeded teams in the Conference. They then defeated Phoenix in five games to reach the Finals, culminating in an overtime goal by Dustin Penner in Game 5, and thus becoming the second team in NHL history to beat the top three Conference seeds in the playoffs (the Calgary Flames achieved the same feat in 2004, ironically also under Darryl Sutter) and the first eighth seed to accomplish the feat. Kings' captain Dustin Brown receiving the Stanley Cup from NHL commissioner Gary Bettman after the Kings won the 2012 Stanley Cup. Los Angeles faced the New Jersey Devils in the Final, defeating them in six games to win their first Stanley Cup in franchise history. With the Game 6 victory occurring on home ice at Staples Center, the Kings became the first team since the 2007 Anaheim Ducks to win the Stanley Cup at home, as well as the second Californian NHL team to do so. The Kings were also the first eight seed champion in any of the North American major leagues, the first Stanley Cup champion that finished below fifth in its conference, and the third to finish below second in its division (after the 1993 Canadiens and the 1995 Devils). Goaltender Jonathan Quick was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player during the playoffs, and soon after signed a ten-year contract extension on June 28. =Defending champions (2012‚Äì2013)= Due to the 2012‚Äì13 NHL lockout, the 2012‚Äì13 Los Angeles Kings season began on January 19, 2013, and was shortened to 48 games. Due to the shortened season, teams only played teams within their own conference. Before the season began, the team traded Kevin Westgarth to the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for Anthony Stewart. They lost their home opener to the Chicago Blackhawks and lost the next two games, only securing a single point in overtime against the Edmonton Oilers. Their first victory came against their Pacific Division rival Phoenix Coyotes. The Kings face off against the Chicago Blackhawks in their first game of the 2012‚Äì13 season. The season was delayed until January due to the NHL lockout. With Willie Mitchell out for the season and Matt Greene injured after the season opener, the Kings made some moves to improve their defense and acquire draft picks. They traded Andrei Loktionov to New Jersey for a 2013 draft pick and traded Simon Gagne to the Philadelphia Flyers for a conditional 2013 fourth-round pick. Additionally, Davis Drewiske was traded to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for a 2013 fifth-round pick, then acquiring Keaton Ellerby from the Florida Panthers for a fifth-round pick in 2013 and acquiring Robyn Regehr from the Buffalo Sabres. Regehr would later sign a two-year contract extension with the Kings during the playoffs. The Kings finished the season as the fifth seed in the West and began the defense of the Cup on the road against the St. Louis Blues, who they swept in the 2012 playoffs. After losing the first two games, the Kings won four in a row to eliminate the Blues in six games. In the second round, they then played a very tough San Jose Sharks team, this time with home ice advantage. In the first game, Jarret Stoll suffered an injury from the Sharks' Raffi Torres, who ended up being suspended for the rest of the series. The Kings eventually won in seven games. In the Western Conference Finals, they faced the number one seed in the West and Presidents' Trophy winner, the Chicago Blackhawks. After dropping the first two games, the Kings won Game 3 with Jeff Carter suffering an injury from Blackhawks defenseman Duncan Keith, who was suspended for Game 4 as a result. After losing Game 4, the Kings battled the Blackhawks through two overtime periods in Game 5, with Patrick Kane eventually scoring the game-winning goal that won the game and the series, sending the Blackhawks to the 2013 Stanley Cup Finals and ending the Kings' season. =Second Stanley Cup victory (2013‚Äì2014)= During the 2013‚Äì14 season, the Kings acquired another Blue Jackets goal scorer in Marian Gaborik, and qualified for their fifth-straight playoffs. The season also had the Kings hosting the first NHL outdoor game in a warm weather city, receiving the Anaheim Ducks at Dodger Stadium as part of the 2014 NHL Stadium Series. The Kings hosted the Anaheim Ducks at Dodger Stadium as a part of the 2014 NHL Stadium Series. In the first round of the 2014 playoffs, the Kings played their in-state rivals, the San Jose Sharks. After losing the first three games to the Sharks, the Kings became the fourth team in NHL history to win the final four games in a row after initially being down three games to none, beating the Sharks in San Jose in the deciding Game 7. In the second round, the Kings played another in-state rival, Anaheim. After starting the series with two wins, the Kings lost three-straight games, trailing the series three games to two. For the second time in the first two rounds of the playoffs, however, the Kings were able to rally back after being down in the series and defeated the Ducks in Anaheim in Game 7. In the third round, the Kings jumped out to a three games to one lead against Stanley Cup-defending Chicago, but were unable to close out the series in the fifth and sixth games. On June 1, 2014, the Kings advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals for the second time in three years after winning Game 7 5‚Äì4 in overtime via a goal from Alec Martinez, clinching their third Western Conference title in franchise history. The Kings became the first team in NHL history to win three Game 7s en route to a Stanley Cup Finals berth. Not only were the Kings the first team in history to accomplish this feat, they also managed to win all game sevens on opposing ice. In the Final, the Kings faced the Eastern Conference-winning New York Rangers, who had defeated the Montreal Canadiens in six games in the Eastern Finals. Parade held for the 2014 Kings team, shortly after they won their second Second Cup, June 2014. The Kings won the Stanley Cup in five games, culminating with an Alec Martinez goal in the second overtime of Game 5 at Staples Center. The championship run had a record 26 playoff games, with the Kings facing elimination a record seven times. With their Game 7 victory in the Conference Finals and wins in the first two games of the Cup Finals, they became the first team to win three consecutive playoff games after trailing by more than one goal in each game. Justin Williams, who scored twice in the Finals and had points in all three Game 7s throughout the playoffs, won the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP. Playoff struggles (2014‚Äìpresent) Having won two Stanley Cup championships in the last three years, the Kings entered the 2014‚Äì15 season as the early favorites to retain their title. Again, however, Los Angeles' post-championship home opener was a defeat, this time a 4‚Äì0 blowout to cross-state rival San Jose Sharks. The following game was an overtime defeat to the Arizona Coyotes, followed by a home win against the Winnipeg Jets. During the season, the Kings took part in their second outdoor game, this time visiting the Sharks at Levi's Stadium for the 2015 NHL Stadium Series The Kings struggled often during the season, with scoring slumps, defensemen losing games to injury and suspensions and frequent road losses. A defeat to the Calgary Flames in the penultimate game of the season eliminated the Kings from playoff contention, while qualifying Calgary, which coincidentally missed the post-season during the Kings' five-season playoff streak. Despite finishing with a record of 40‚Äì27‚Äì15, the Kings became the first defending Stanley Cup champion to miss the post-season since the 2006‚Äì07 Carolina Hurricanes and only the fourth overall since the 1967 NHL expansion season. The Kings face off against the San Jose Sharks in the first round of the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs. At the start of the 2015‚Äì16 season. The Kings were expected to make the playoffs. They entered the playoffs as the fifth seeded in their conference and second seeded in their division. They faced the San Jose Sharks, but lost to them in five games. On June 16, 2016, the Kings named Anze Kopitar the 14th captain in team history, replacing Dustin Brown, who had led the team for the past eight seasons. The Kings celebrated their 50th anniversary during the 2016‚Äì17 season along with the other still active 1967 expansion teams (the St. Louis Blues, Philadelphia Flyers, and Pittsburgh Penguins), and for the first time since 2002, they hosted the NHL All-Star Game. Goaltender Jonathan Quick suffered an injury on opening night that sidelined him for most of the season, and the Kings struggled without him. Backup Peter Budaj filled the void, earning his first starting duties since his time with the Colorado Avalanche six years earlier, but near the trade deadline, the Kings traded him to Tampa Bay for another goalie, Ben Bishop who shared the crease with Jonathan Quick down the stretch, the superstar having returned from his injury. Despite the trade, the Kings ultimately missed the playoffs for the second time in three seasons and, in the offseason, fired general manager Dean Lombardi and head coach Darryl Sutter. Assistant general manager Rob Blake was promoted to be the new general manager, and John Stevens took over as head coach after serving as associate head coach for the Kings for several seasons. In the 2017 NHL Expansion Draft, the Vegas Golden Knights drafted defenseman Brayden McNabb, who had been left unprotected by the Kings. In the next season, the Kings clinched the playoffs as a wild card, but were swept by the expansion Golden Knights. On November 4, 2018, the Kings fired Stevens as head coach after the team started the 2018‚Äì19 season 4‚Äì8‚Äì1, and replaced him with Willie Desjardins. In Desjardins' debut on November 7, the Kings defeated the Ducks 4‚Äì1. The Kings finished last in the Pacific Division and Western Conference and they missed the playoffs for the third time in five seasons.

Early life and education Ramirez is of mixed- ethnicity. Her mother, Ana Tzintz√∫n, is from a rural agricultural community in Michoac√°n, Mexico, and her father, Thomas Costello, is a white American who came to live in Mexico in the 1960s and 1970s. Tzintz√∫n's original surname was Costello, which she changed to Tzintz√∫n as a teenager. She was born and raised in Ohio, where her parents operated a fair-trade Mexican jewelry business. The family business required that the Tzintz√∫n family live and travel to Mexico throughout her early life. Her parents, both progressive, encouraged their children to participate in various causes, especially those involving the Latino immigrant community. In high school, Tzintz√∫n began organizing and working with newly-arrived Mexican immigrants in Ohio.\\"Colonize This!\\" in: Colonize This!: Young Women of Color on Today‚Äôs Feminism, Edited by Daisy Hern√°ndez and Bushra Rehman.

Career Tzintz√∫n began organizing with Latino immigrant workers in 2000 in Columbus, Ohio, and then moved to Texas, where she helped establish the Workers Defense Project (WDP), serving as its Executive Director from 2006 until 2016. At the WDP, Tzintz√∫n and co-founder Emily Timm led the organization to focus its efforts on the construction industry, the largest employer of undocumented labor in Texas. She helped spearhead the organization's efforts to organize workers in one of the most- hostile political climates for worker and immigrant organizing in the country.

Tzintz√∫n helped lead the organization to pass over half a dozen local ordinances and state laws better protecting the rights of hundreds of thousands of workers by combining grassroots organizing, strategic research and smart communications strategies. She co-authored two reports on construction workers in Texas that resulted in a federal investigation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and led the agency to review 900 construction sites resulting in $2 million in fines. Tzintz√∫n created and developed the organization's Better Builder Program, which won construction workers living wages, higher safety standards, training and on- site enforcement by Better Builder monitors against some of the largest corporations in the world.

It is a series of runs for men and boys that take place around the UK in June. They can run, walk, wheel or jog around the courses and raise money for the charity via sponsorship. Jackson founded it after two of his uncles developed prostate cancer and although one responded to treatment the other was less fortunate and died. That prompted him to find out more information about the illness and he was shocked to discover that whilst 1 in 8 men in the UK will develop prostate cancer, that rises to 1 in 4 men from an African Caribbean background.

The narrative follows a triangle drama between the daughter of a landed proprietor, her cousin who she is engaged to, and her Gypsy adoptive sister who also is in love with the cousin. The drama culminates on a Saint John's Eve which is loaded with both Christian and pre- Christian symbols. The theme of the play is gratitude and dependence, and the bounds it can create. Adaptations The play was adapted for film in 1916 as The Flames of Johannis, directed by Edgar Lewis, in 1939 as Midsummer Night's Fire, directed by Arthur Maria Rabenalt, and in 1954 as Love is Forever, directed by Wolfgang Liebeneiner.

Early life Bormann was born in 1853 in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul. Her parents were Patr√≠cio de Fontoura Lima, a civil servant in the Brazilian middle class, and Lu√≠sa Bormann de Lima; she also had a sister, Julieta. In 1863, Bormann moved with her family to Rio de Janeiro, then the capital of the Brazilian Empire. In 1872, at the age of 19, Bormann married her maternal uncle, Jos√© Bernardino Bormann, a military marshal who had served in the Paraguayan War. He continued to be active in military work after their marriage, and was away for lengthy periods. (He was made Brazilian War Secretary in 1910, filling the post until 1914.) From her youth onward, Bormann both wrote and drew prolifically, but destroyed all work she did not wish to have published. Career In 1881, Bormann publicly joined the ongoing struggle for feminism in Brazil by publishing her first novel, Magdalena, in the newspaper O Sorriso. From then on until 1895, Bormann's writings were published in wide-circulation Rio de Janeiro newspapers, including Gazeta de Tarde, Gazeta de Not√≠cias, and O Paiz. Her published work included essays, short stories, and serialized novels. For writing, she took up the pseudonym D√©lia, a name suggesting the Greek goddess Artemis (whose birthplace was said to be the island of Delos) as well as the ancient Roman woman Delia mentioned in the love poems of Tibullus. Bormann's novels include Magdalena (1881), Uma V√≠tima (1883), Duas irm√£s (1884), Aur√©lia (1883), L√©sbia (1890), and Celeste (1894). Her works feature controversial themes that had not been seen before in Brazilian fiction, and which were seen as inappropriate for women to discuss, including female sexuality, female body imagery, and conflicts between mothers and daughters. Their protagonists are often intellectually active and sensually aware women attempting to overcome oppression from patriarchal social structures, especially those relating to families and domestic life. L√©sbia, a K√ºnstlerroman, tells the story of a creative woman who, in pursuit of both erotic and cerebral passions, breaks through her society's gender roles to explore androgyny. Celeste, a Bildungsroman, features a woman who decides to abandon her psychologically and physically abusive husband.  Works  * Magdalena (1881) * Aur√©lia (1883) * Uma V√≠tima (1883) * Duas irm√£s (1884) * L√©sbia (1890) * Celeste (1893) * Angelina (1894) Personal life According to a contemporary, the writer In√™s Sabino, Bormann was known as an elegant and sophisticated woman who often attended intellectual salons, sometimes singing mezzo-soprano while accompanying herself on the piano. In addition to Portuguese, she spoke English and French. Bormann died of a stomach ulcer in July 1895. Reception Because of their controversial treatment of female sexuality, Bormann's novels were criticized by at least two contemporary writers: Araripe J√∫nior dismissed Celestes protagonist as an insane erotomaniac, while In√™s Sabino referred to Bormann disparagingly as a female equivalent of √âmile Zola. After her death, Bormann's works were largely forgotten until the mid-1970s, when a new wave of interest in Brazilian women writers began. During this wave, Bormann's writings, as well those of as other neglected Brazilian women writers such as J√∫lia Lopes de Almeida, Maria Firmina dos Reis, Albertina Berta and Carmen Dolores, were brought back into print. The Cambridge History of Latin American Women's Literature describes Bormann as one of the most important writers of her era.

One significant aspect of the act is that it replaced anti-social behaviour orders, the primary civil order in the United Kingdom since 1998, with criminal behaviour orders.  Background  In 2012, the government produced a white paper titled Putting victims first: more effective responses to anti-social behaviour, that outlined its intentions about reforming anti-social behaviour legislation. The white paper stated that it wanted to challenge dangerous and yobbish behaviour of those who make victims‚Äô lives a misery. The 2013 government paper, Reform of Anti-Social Behaviour Powers: Groups ‚ÄòHanging Around‚Äô mentioned specifically targeting certain types of youths behaviour. It mentioned that the government acknowledged that youths ‚Äòhanging about‚Äô might cause people to feel intimidated and fear for their safety regardless if their behaviour was anti-social. Government publications also revealed it was eager to deal with concerns about the perceived anti-social behaviour of people who are drunks, beggars, and irresponsible dog owners.  Putting victims first  The focus for the act was on putting victims first, and the powers are designed to be quicker to implement so that victims get respite from anti-social behaviour faster. With the exception of the criminal behaviour order, the remainder can be processed through the civil courts which allows for a lower burden of proof and thus makes it easier for agencies to obtain. The act also set out an absolute possession enabling councils and housing associations to evict anti- social tenants already found guilty of anti-social behaviour. To put victims first, there were also two measures introduced in this act to enable victims to have their say: # Community remedy ‚Äì whereby victims can have a say in what type of punishment would be appropriate for the offender (e.g. clean up graffiti) # Anti-social behaviour case review ‚Äì also called 'community trigger'. A victim can insist on a multi-agency review of their case if they have reported the problem three times in the past six months and yet the problem has not yet been resolved.  Consolidation  The focus of the Act was to streamline the tools and powers available to front-line agencies in dealing with anti-social behaviour. Previously there had been nineteen different powers, but these were reduced to a base of six. The previous nineteen mechanisms were: * Anti-social behaviour injunctions * Anti-social behaviour orders (ASBOs) * Closure orders (known as S.161) * Crackhouse closure orders * Criminal anti-social behaviour orders (CrASBOs) * Designated public place orders * Direction to leave orders (known as S.27) * Disposal orders (known as S.30) * Dog control orders * Drinking banning orders * Drinking banning orders (on conviction) * Gating orders * Graffiti/defacement removal notices * Individual support orders * Intervention orders * Litter cleaning notices * Noisy premises closure orders * Premises closure orders * Street litter cleaning notices The Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 consolidated them to: * Civil injunctions * Criminal behaviour orders * Dispersal powers * Community protection notices and remedial orders * Public spaces protection orders * Closure notices and orders * Absolute grounds for possession The government produces statutory guidance about the use of the six new mechanisms. December 2017 is the latest revision of the guidance . = Civil injunctions = Part 1 of the Act empowers specified organisations to apply to the courts for a civil injunction against anyone aged 10 or over for actual or threatened anti-social behaviour. Suggested by the government is that civil injunctions might be used for aggressive begging, bullying, gangs, irresponsible dog ownership, noisy or abusive neighbours, public drunkenness, and vandalism. The injunction is a civil rather than a criminal order. A civil injunction can either prohibit or require a person to refrain from activities mentioned in the order. A court has the discretion if to include a power of arrest for breaches of the injunction. Breaches of an injunction are treated as contempt of court. Statutory government guidance provides four tests for using a civil injunction. On the balance of probabilities, the behaviour must be likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress (non-housing related anti- social behaviour); or conduct capable of causing nuisance or annoyance (housing-related anti-social behaviour); and just and convenient to grant the injunction to prevent anti-social behaviour. = Criminal behaviour orders  Dispersal powers = Part 3 of the Act covers police powers permitting the dispersal of people. The powers of dispersal require the authorisation of a police officer at least the rank of inspector. The act only allows authorising dispersal powers when members of the public in the locality are being harassed, alarmed or distressed, or when there is localised crime and disorder. The authorisation is limited to forty-eight hours. Authorising officers should consider the principles of the Human Rights Act. The statutory Government guidance requires consideration of the impact of vulnerable people, the displacement of the problems elsewhere, and if working in partnership with other agencies might provide a longer-term solution. When authorised to do so, police officers and police community support officers, if permitted by their chief constable, can, in writing when feasible, direct a person to leave a geographical area and not return for a defined time period. The exceptions are people under ten years old, in which case if they are under sixteen the Children Act 2004 allows taking them to their home. A direction should not be given that prevents a person from going to their home, their place of employment, where they are receiving education or training, places where they are receiving medical treatment or any place they are required to attend by a court. The power exists to seize any articles that are connected to the anti- social behaviour. Failing to disperse or preventing the seizure of articles related to the anti-social behaviour is a criminal offence. = Public spaces protection orders = PSPO warning sign in Knightsbridge, London A public spaces protection order (PSPO) is an order which bans specific acts in a designated geographical area in England and Wales as set out in the act. It replaces the earlier designated public place orders, gating orders and dog control orders. PSPOs are intended to prevent specific acts which would not otherwise be criminal offences. They have been criticised as restricting freedoms and having a disproportionately severe effect on people below the poverty line. As of December 2017, there were 388 active PSPOs in Wales alone. Research by The Manifesto Club found a 420% increase in PSPO fines from 2016 to 2018. In 2018 there were 9,930 fines issued, 60% of which were from four councils: Peterborough, Bedford, Hillingdon and Waltham Forest. These four councils use private contractors to issue the fines. Examples include: *Hackney Council attempted to introduce a PSPO which would have banned rough sleeping. A similar ban was proposed in Newport. *Salford City Council introduced a PSPO covering Salford Quays, which bans acts including using foul and abusive language. This has been interpreted as a response to football fans. *Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea introduced a PSPO \\"to address the excessive level of noise nuisance, annoyance, danger or risk or harm or injury caused by motor vehicles to members of the public\\" in Knightsbridge.Public Spaces Protection Order for Knightsbridge * Peterborough City Council introduced a PSPO to ban littering, spitting and cycling in specific roads in the centre of Peterborough. * Kettering Borough Council enacted a curfew banning individuals under 18 from going outside alone between 11pm and 6am. = Community protection notices and remedial orders = Part 4 of the Act introduced community protection notices and remedial orders. The aim of them was to challenge ongoing nuisance problems detrimental to a community‚Äôs quality of life. The use of community protection notices does not interfere with the obligation of local authorities to issue abatement notices for statutory nuisances. A person over the age of sixteen, an organisation or business can be issued a community protection notice. The statutory guidance states that the vulnerability of a person should additionally be considered before issuing a notice. Before a notice is issued they must receive written notice warning them about the problem they are causing, and issuing a notice is an option being considered. It is issued by either giving it to a person, organisation or business, leaving at their address, or posting it to them. Community protection notices have three potential purposes, to stop or make them do something, or take reasonable steps towards an outcome. What is expected of them is written on the notice. Failing to conform to a community protection notice is an offence. The liability of a person, organisation or business for the offence is negated by payment of a fixed penalty notice up to the value of ¬£100. If a community protection notice is breached, a remedial order can be applied for at court. = Closure notices and orders = Part 4 of the act empowers the issuing of closure notices and closure orders. Both notices and orders can be applied to residential and other premises. Issuing a closure notice is usually the first resort to dealing with a problem. Closure notices can be issued if either nuisance or disorder has, or may occur at the premises. The notice is in force for a maximum of forty-eight hours. A closure notice can bar any person from accessing the premises, except any residents. The penalty for breaching a notice upon conviction is a maximum of three months‚Äô imprisonment and an unlimited fine. Closure orders are usually issued in more serious instances. The criteria for issuing an order is that the premises must be connected to disorderly, offensive, or criminal behaviour, or disorderly behaviour in the near vicinity of it. It must be a serious nuisance to the public. An order can prohibit any person from entering the premises, including a resident. The maximum penalty for breaching a notice is up to six months imprisonment and an unlimited fine. The Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 created an offence of obstructing a person issuing an order or notice, officials entering the premises, or people securing it. The maximum penalty is three months imprisonment. The act did no consolidate all closure powers, for example, closure of licensed premises under the Licensing Act 2003, or closure of premises used for prostitution under the Sexual Offences Act 2003.  Additional offences  The Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 included several additional provisions: * Dangerous dogs * Firearms * Protection from sexual harm, including sexual risk orders * Child sexual exploitation in hotels * Violent offending * Forced marriages * Policing, including the National College of Policing, and complaints against the police * Extradition * Criminal justice and court fees = Sexual risk orders = The Act also created sexual risk orders, which can require suspects to give police advanced notification of intention to engage in sexual activities or face prison sentences. The SROs, requested by police, are issued by magistrates. = Forced marriage = The Act also created several new offences relating to forced marriage: * breaching a forced marriage protection order (amendment to the Family Law Act 1996) * causing a forced marriage, i.e. using threats, violence or other coercion (not necessarily against the victim) to cause a person to marry without their full and free consent (or any person who lacks capacity to consent even without coercion) * using deception to cause a person to leave the UK to enter into a forced marriage. The latter two offences are defined separately for England and Wales and for Scotland. They apply to any marriage ceremony even if not legally binding.  Amendments of the Extradition Act 2003  This bill also added a very important limitation to European Arrest Warrants, barring extradition in the \\"absence of prosecution decision\\" if there are reasonable grounds to believe, that the competent authorities in the country requesting the extradition have not made a decision to charge or have not made a decision to try the suspect. This amendment became famously known as \\"Lex Assange\\", because Julian Assange in fact never got charged in Sweden, but UK's highest courts still decided the extradition request to be legal.  Criticisms of the Act  A general criticism of the Act was it interfered with the rights of young people, made them feel unable to use public places as they wish, even if their behaviour and activities are lawful.

Life Overton was born at Monk Fryston in Yorkshire, where his father was a small landed proprietor. He attended the village school there, and went to Magdalene College, Cambridge, graduating B.A. in 1790. Magdalene was then beginning to be an evangelical stronghold; he took an ordinary degree. Having received holy orders, Overton became assistant curate to William Richardson of York, a leading evangelical. He remained with Richardson until 1802, when he was appointed, through the influence of William Wilberforce, to the chancellor's livings of St. Crux and St. Margaret's in the city of York. In politics Overton was a Tory and admirer of Pitt the younger. He took an active part in promoting the election of Wilberforce to parliament. He died at York on 17 July 1838, and was buried in the chancel of St. Crux, in a vault with his wife. Works Overton is best known as the author of The True Churchmen Ascertained (1801).The True Churchmen Ascertained; or an Apology for those of the regular clergy of the establishment who are sometimes called Evangelical Ministers, occasioned by the publications of Drs. Paley, Hey, and Croft, Messrs. Daubeny, Ludlam, Polwhele, the Reviewers, &c.; It was published at York in 1801, and reached a second edition in 1802. This work was a reply to The Anti-Calvinist (1800) of Robert Fellowes. The evangelicals, Overton contended, > \\"are the true churchmen; and, in a very fundamental and important sense of > the word, Mr. Daubeny and his associates are dissenters from the Church of > England.\\" In 1802 Edward Pearson at Cambridge, published Remarks on the Doctrine of Justification by Faith in a Letter to J. Overton, followed in the same year by Remarks in a Second Letter. Charles Daubeny defended his position in Vindici√¶ Ecclesi√¶ Anglican√¶ (1803), largely concerned with The True Churchmen. A negative review of Overton's book appeared in the Christian Observer, ‚Äô an evangelical periodical edited by Zachary Macaulay; Overton replied in Four Letters to the Editor of the \\"Christian Observer\\". The book was, however, welcomed by other evangelicals in correspondence: Richard Cecil, Thomas Dykes, William Hey, Professor Parish, and Charles Simeon. Overton published patriotic sermons: one in 1803 after the end of the Peace of Amiens that was praised in the British Critic; and another in 1814. Family In 1792 Overton married Elizabeth Stodart (died 1827) of Reeth, near Hawes, in the Yorkshire dales, whose father was agent to the lairds of Arkendale. They had a family of twelve children: eight sons and four daughters. The sons all grew up to manhood, and were six feet and upwards in height. Four of them‚ÄîJohn, William, Thomas, and Charles‚Äîtook holy orders; two were lawyers, and two were doctors. John, the eldest (B.A. 1820 and M.A. 1823, Trinity College, Cambridge), won the Seatonian prize at Cambridge, and was rector of Sessay.

Lower Moselle countryside near Hatzenport in October 2\\\\. Terraced vineyards on the steep hillsides of the Koberner Uhlen (behind) and Winninger Uhlen in March The Lower Moselle ( or Terrassenmosel) is the name given to the lower reaches of the Moselle river - just under 100 kilometres long - in Germany between P√ºnderich and the Moselle's confluence with the Rhine at Koblenz. The Lower Moselle landscape differs from that of the Middle and Upper Moselle, much of it forming a narrower valley with high and steep sides in places. On the cut banks of the river that are oriented towards the south and west, vineyards are managed, often on the tiniest, terraced strips of land on steep hillslopes. The upgrading of the Moselle into a waterway for big ships in the 1960s has permanently changed the appearance of the river and its banks. Five changes of level between Koblenz and ZellRheinisches Landesmuseum Trier, Ausstellungskatalog Mosel ‚Äì Fluss, Wasserstrasse und Lebensraum, Trier, 1989 in order to build locks for large ships have changed a riverbed that was narrow in places and wide in others with gently sloping banks into a canal- like waterway that is contained by artificial walls and rock embankments in the areas of the locks.  Geography and boundaries  The Lower Moselle begins in the wine village of P√ºnderich and ends at its confluence in the city of Koblenz where it empties into the Rhine at the Deutsches Eck (\\"German Corner\\"). It separates the Central Upland mountain ranges of the Eifel and Hunsr√ºck and flows through the two counties of Cochem-Zell and Mayen-Koblenz in the north of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The settlements in the valley are predominantly small villages that increased in area towards the end of the 20th century. Towns with central administrative functions are Zell (pop. in 2009 = 4,200) and Cochem (pop. in 2009 = 4,900). Tourism and winegrowing are important economic factors in this region. The first division of the river into the Lower and Middle/Upper Moselle may have been a consequence of the foundation of the Roman provinces of Germania superior (Upper Germania) and Gallia Belgica in the 1st century AD.Heinz C√ºppers (ed.): Die R√∂mer in Rheinland-Pfalz. Stuttgart, 1990, The border between the two administrations crossed the river between the present-day Moselle towns of Traben-Trarbach and Zell. In the Late Middle Ages this line divided the Upper (Obere) and Lower Archdiocese (Untere Erzstift) of the Electorate of Trier. From 1798 to 1814 it formed the boundary between the French departements of Saar and Rhine and Moselle, from 1824 to 1999 the provinces of Koblenz and Trier.Franz-Josef Heyen (ed.): Geschichte des Landes Rheinland-Pfalz. Freiburg / Wurzburg, 1981, It is also where the line of 50¬∞ latitude runs, which was often seen as a critical boundary for winegrowing in northern countries. Biologists see in the Mediterranean fauna of the microclimatically favourable southern hillsides of the Moselle valley the markings of a northern boundary of the Mediterranean region.

Photo Bernd Ternes The hillsides of the Lower Moselle, with their strikingly varied types of rock and rock formations, bear witness to the end of a development phase in the earth's history in the Moselle area, which began about 390 million years ago in the Lower Devonian. At that time there was a shallow sea in this region that was bounded in the north by the Old Red Continent and in the south by the island structures of the Central German Uplands. From these land masses sediments washed into the slowly sinking shallow sea over millions of years thus forming a thick bed of rock unit with a thickness of up to 14 kilometres, which geologists call the Moselle Trough (Moseltrog). Subsequently, these deposits were solidified through folding, pressure and heat into rock masses of varying stability (cleavage takes place at 250¬∞‚Äì400 ¬∞C, silicic acid, i.e.quartz, can be mobilised at 300 ¬∞C). Most of this development took place in the Carboniferous period, 350 million years ago, when the Rhenish Massif was uplifted and folded. The shaping of the present Moselle landscape began in the Tertiary period. The water of the later Moselle initially washed through a wide, flat valley in a still relatively gently rolling hill country. In the last 500,000 years the Rhenish Massif continued to be uplifted, so that the Moselle cut deeply into the rock masses.Geolog. Erl√§uterungen Bernd Ternes, Dienstleistungszentrum L√§ndlicher Raum Westerwald-Osteifel, Mayen Until the middle of the 20th century, the settlement of this cultural landscape of small, closely built villages surrounded by orchards and gardens and terraced vineyards, only changed slowly. Today many of the former orchard fields lie fallow or have fallen victim to development as villages have grown, to industrial estates and roads, but also large-scale, consolidated vineyards. On the hillsides many old terrace walls have been demolished and levelled in order to simplify farming and construct farm tracks. The impression of a historically evolved, terraced, cultural landscape is thus quite a rare sight in several sections of the valley. With the aid of predominantly publicly funded job creation schemes, overgrown terraces that had run wild have had their vegetation removed in several places in order to preserve the picture of a cultural landscape created by man as well as the biotope of very sunny terraces. The digging up and removal of vines from abandoned sites is also required in order to prevent the spread of plant diseases such as grape black rot or phylloxera. Abandoned vineyards are a consequence of the structural changes in viticulture, whereby small businesses, especially those which only marketed cask wine, are closed on economic grounds or as a result of a lack of successors or, where vineyards on steep slopes are abandoned in favour of only gently sloping and consolidated sites.Land Rheinland-Pfalz, Dienstleistungszentrum L√§ndlicher Raum Mosel, Terroir an Mosel, Saar und Ruwer, Bernkastel,o.D. From 1999 to 2009 the area of steep hillside being used for viticulture reduced from 998 ha to 764 ha.Office of Statistics, Rhineland-Palatinate. By contrast, the recultivation of older sites, that as early as the Napoleonic and royal Prussian eras were valued and mapped due to their above-average land prices. Many of these sites are stand out due to the unusual stock of vines and wider terraces; instead of the closely spaced individual stakes with the traditional curvature, new vines are increasingly trained using espalier wires and are spaced more widely apart. In the Moselweisser Hamm area, shortly before Koblenz, the recultivation and terracing of old vineyards was carried out using sloping, grassed embankments instead of stone walls. (Fig. 11). Villages with extensive vineyards are, in the county of Cochem-Zell: P√ºnderich, Briedel, Kaimt, Merl, St. Aldegund, Neef, Bremm, Eller, Ediger, Senheim, Bruttig-Fankel, Ellenz-Poltersdorf, Ernst, Valwig, Klotten, Pommern, Treis- Karden, M√ºden and Moselkern. In Mayen-Koblenz: Hatzenport, Alken, Lehmen, Niederfell, Kobern-Gondorf and Winningen. Lay, Moselweiss and G√ºls are within the municipal area of Koblenz. The geographical term, Lower Moselle, covers the areas known for tourism reasons as Zeller Land (region of the collective municipality of Zell between P√ºnderich and Neef including the villages on the Hunsr√ºck), and Ferienland Cochem (\\"Cochem Holiday Country\\"), the region of the collective municipality of Cochem) between Bremm and Klotten. The Calmont vineyard in Bremm and Eller (the steepest in Europe), the Valwiger Herrenberg and the Kobern-Winninger Uhlen etc. are among the steepest terraced vineyards on the Moselle. In 2003, the Association of German Fine and Quality Wines (Verband Deutscher Pr√§dikats- und Qualit√§tsweing√ºter, VDP), following the vineyard assessments of the Vineyard Map for the Province of Koblenz of 1897 (Weinbaukarte f√ºr den Regierungsbezirk Koblenz von 1897), assessed specific plots in the areas of Marienburg and Nonnenberg in P√ºnderich, Kirchberg and Stolzenberg in Hatzenport and Uhlen and R√∂ttgen in Winningen as \\"First Class\\". The classification is only carried out for those vineyards that are managed by members of the Vdp. Other sites are not assessed by the Vdp. The most popular grape variety grown in the Lower Moselle is the Riesling with 59.7% of the total.Office of Statistics, Rhineland-Palatinate, 2005) It is followed by the Pinot Blanc (12.6%) and the Pinot Noir (5.5%), some way behind, but on the increase. The landscape with the terraced vineyards on extremely steep slopes on the valley sides of the Moselle has been referred to since the end of the 20th century as the Terrassenmosel (lit.: \\"Terrace Moselle\\"), a wine industry and tourist label. It was introduced by the Winningen vintner, Winzer Reinhard L√∂wenstein. This description caught on due to the features of the countryside with its very steep vineyards, a unique element even when compared with other regions, e.g. the neighbouring Middle Moselle. Both tourist and wine marketing organisations use the term Terrassenmosel instead of Untermosel (\\"Lower Moselle\\") for their own identity and manufacturing purposes.

Reconstruction of an old terrace wall: l. to r. Gabions (rubblestone in wire baskets), mortared wall with new rubble stones, surviving section of dry stone wall from the rocks of the same hillside: Niederfeller Kahllay In the late 1970s, archaeologists discovered the first evidence of possible Roman terracing on the hillsides of the Moselle valley: Land consolidation and the laying out of new farm tracks in vineyards on the Middle Moselle and the upper Lower Moselle exposed the foundations of ancient Celtic houses at the foot of the hillsides. The archaeological sites on the steep hillsides still being managed today could therefore be viewed as evidence of Roman terracing on these slopes in the 3rd century AD.Karl-Josef Gilles (ed.): Neuere Forschungen zum r√∂mischen Weinbau an Mosel und Rhein, Gesellschaft f√ºr Geschichte des Weines Wiesbaden 1995, No such finds were made between Cochem and Koblenz. The reason for that could be ‚Äì despite much evidence of Gallo-Roman settlement ‚Äì a possibly lower level of population, but also the construction of railways and roads in the late 19th century meant that the many vineyards at the foot of old hillside sites in e. g. Hatzenport, Karden, Kobern or Winningen were swept away; possible clues for ancient Celtic sites could thus have been lost without anyone realising. For the late 6th century AD, however, there are written accounts of the early cultivation of steep hillsides for winegrowing in a record of a journey on the Moselle by the ancient writer, Venantius Fortunatus: ‚Ä¶ where leafy vineyards soar up to bare hill tops / and rich shady leaves cover the dry gravel / here the harvest collects the coloured grapes of the vintners / even on the rocky slope he picks the fruit. The demise of Roman civilisation and changes in population during the Migration Period probably left viticulture on the Lower Moselle largely undisturbed.Hermann Ament: Die Franken in den R√∂merst√§dten der Rheinzone. In: Reiss-Museum Mannheim (ed.): Die Franken ‚Äì Wegbereiter Europas. Mainz, 1996, , pp. 129 ff. Laws passed by the Frankish kings protected the old established winemakers. For example, there were islands of settlement here until the High Middle Ages in which Moselle Roman was spoken instead of a Frankish language.Rudolf Post, Zur Geschichte und Erforschung des Moselromanischen, Rhein. Vierteljahresbl√§tter No. 68, Bonn 2004 The still commonly used dialect word for a vineyard terrace - Chur or Kuur (plural: Chuer, Kuure), derived from cura (Latin for \\"care\\") or chorus (Latin for the raised altar area of a church). From the 9th century there is a rich record of viniculture for almost all villages on the Lower Moselle.Barbara Weiter- Matysiak: Weinbau im Mittelalter. Beiheft zum Geschichtl. Atlas d. Rheinlande VII/2, Cologne, 1985 (e. g. Ediger in the year 766, Kobern in 817, Bruttig in 898). Many vineyards were probably still on the level or lower hillsides. The High Middle Ages was the epoch when manual labourers began to build stable terrace walls - based on skills learned in constructing castles in challenging engineering situations on rocky ridges and above steep precipices. The terrace walls were probably mainly of dry stone construction because the amount of mortar required for the irregular rubble stone used would just have been too expensive. Around 30 per cent of the construction costs were estimated by Archbishop BalduinIngeborg Scholz: Erzbischof Balduin (1307‚Äì1354) als Bauherr von Landesburgen im Erzstift Trier. M√ºnster/W., 2004, pp. 164‚Äì166 (also Diss. Uni. Marburg 2003) to have been consumed by the firing and transport of the necessary lime for mortar and plaster of his castles in the Middle Rhine-Lower Moselle area. (figs. 16 and 17). 16\\\\.

Detail of the mortared shield wall of the lower ward from the 12th century. Behind: the Late Romanesque St. Matthias' Chapel The rise in population in the Middle Ages, the demand of the trading centres of Cologne, present-day Belgium and the Netherlands and the, compared with today, high per-capita consumption of wine must have led to an expansion of the winegrowing areas and associated terracing needed. In deeds of ownership and enfeoffment of the time there are even sites managed today that could have been terraced as early as the 12th century. Gepirg pringt edlern wein (\\"steep slopes produce better wine\\") was an adage recorded in a farming guide of the 14th century. Gebirge or Gepirg was the name given to steep locations on the valley sides until the 19th century. Phases of closure, abandonment and ruination of terraces followed plagues, war or climatic changes. In the late 19th century the terracing of valley sides along the Lower Moselle ‚Äì occasionally almost to the hilltops ‚Äì probably reached its greatest extent. The successive terracing uphill also occurred especially in the terroirs, which from the earliest times were known for highly sought after wines that commanded high prices. In order to produce greater quantities, terraces were also laid in the side valleys and on less favourable sites. Around 1880 the Province of Koblenz still named around 2,500 hectares of vineyard land, mainly on steep hillsides.Felix Meyer: Der Weinbau an Mosel, Saar und Ruwer. Koblenz, 1926 From the mid-20th century production on the terraced vineyards of the steep hillsides of the Lower Moselle stagnated. The sites that were difficult to access and could only be managed by hand became overgrown and scrubby; many walls collapsed. In the 1960s and 1970s the smaller, less steep areas began to be consolidated into larger vineyards. This enabled them to be farmed more economically using machines, thus reducing the manpower needed and the cost. However, it meant the levelling of many, formerly terraced slopes and the demolition of many vineyard walls that were important for the ecology and the appearance of the countryside (Figs.30-33). Aid from the public sector, funding from national and European budgets, and in particular the installation of monorack railways developed in Switzerland for steep slopes, that simplified the mechanical transport of men and materials, are now preventing some sites from falling into decay. (Figs. 13 and 13a). = Shape and significance of vineyard terraces = 18\\\\. Old terraced vineyard F√§chern in Niederfell, formerly called Grub. 19\\\\. Detail of an old dry stone wall, made of rubble stone from the F√§chern. The advantages of slope terracing to increase the area available for cultivation were mentioned in ancient Roman agricultural instruction books (e.g. Junius Moderatus Columella around 60 AD in De re rustica). A description of terrace building on the Moselle has been handed down by a Baden oenologist from the 19th century, describing a technique that was probably used even in Roman times: \\"Because all hillsides are rocky by nature and there is little space for building in the open areas between the rocks, the whole terrace has to be dug out to the specified depth. To do this, rocks are broken off and split; those pieces that are not left to weather and break up in the open air, become stones used for the terraces (Figs. 18 and 19). Thus one terrace is formed around another until the entire plot is created.\\" Jof. Ph Bronner: Der Weinbau in der Privinz Rheinhessen, im Nahethal und Moselthal. Heidelberg, 1834. High terrace walls are often mortared for better stability. Today, new walls are built for landscape conservation reasons of stone from local quarries. Wall depths and foundations are based on the planned height. Walls two metres high are - if not on bedrock \\\\- built on very large stones, or on a concrete foundation of 100 cm √ó 60 cm depth and height. An uphill oriented gradient to help stabilise the wall can be achieved by angled construction, or the stacking of stones that are repeatedly set back from the bottom upwards. The stones are set alternately 2 to 1 and 1 to 2 and each lies on at least 3 points of its surface. For one cubic metre of wall around two tons of stone has to be used. The terraces are, in addition to their agricultural engineering significance, examples of great cultural historical value, their organisation and often masterful architecture witnessing as far back as the Middle Ages. The small scale structure of the plots forms protective barriers against plant disease and provides habitats for a variety of warmth-loving flora and fauna. The Apollo butterfly, the green lizard, the wallflower and rock bunting are only the best known representatives of the ecosystem of the Terraced Moselle that have been recorded in the case studies of small animals and plants of the region.Annette and Bodo M√ºller: Modelluntersuchung √ºber die Bedeutung von Weinbergsmauern in Niederfell und Winningen f√ºr den Arten- und Biotopenschutz. Mannheim- Ehringshausen, 1985 = Terrace wall \\"images\\" = Strikingly carefully built and stable walls are referred to as a \\"beautiful mural\\" (sch√∂nen Mauerbild). The building of a vineyard wall is today, especially in the larger wineries, carried out by specialist stonemasons. Until the mid-20th century, when the Lower Moselle winegrowing holdings were mostly run by small family farms, each vintner had to be able to construct a wall himself and, in particular, to carry out the repair of collapsed sections of wall.

Until the middle of the 20th century the hillsides of the village were largely planted and farmed by a large number of vintners. At the end of the century the number of vintners in Hatzenport and the plots tended by them had dropped sharply. An amalgamation of the plots, new tracks across the hillside and the abandonment of small terraces in higher locations enabled planting based on economical methods of cultivation.

Bartlett was committed to promoting the work of fellow contemporary artists and was a founding member of the Arts Club of Chicago, a pioneering organization dedicated to the advancement of modern art. Bartlett's Early life Bartlett was born in Chicago to Mary Pitkin Bartlett and Adolphus Clay Bartlett, the president of the Hibbard Spencer Bartlett & Company, the company that originated the label True Value. He attended St. Paul's in Concord, New Hampshire, and the Harvard School for Boys in Chicago. However, at the age of nineteen, instead of pursuing a college degree, Bartlett traveled to Europe from Chicago to study art Frederic Clay and Helen Birch Bartlett: The Collectors by Courtney Graham Donnell, FortuneArchive.com Bartlett attributed the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 as his main source of inspiration regarding fine art. In 1894, Bartlett, along with fellow Chicagoan, Robert Allerton, would be admitted to the Royal Academy in Munich, an honor that very few Americans would earn. It was during his time in Germany that Bartlett would meet Dora Tripp from White Plains, New York, the woman that would eventually become his wife. In 1896, after completing their studies in Munich, Allerton and Bartlett would study under masters Aman-Jean and Collin during their enrollment at Ecole Collin. They would study drawing under Collin and Painting under Aman-Jean for two years while in Paris. His Marriages=Dora Tripp= On October 4, 1898, Bartlett and Tripp would get married in upstate New York and spend the next year in Paris, studying under American painter James Abbott McNeill Whistler's Acad√©mie Carmen. After Whistler's school closed, Bartlett enhanced his painting prowess by studying mural art with the direction of French master, Puvis de Chavannes. The following year, Bartlett and his wife would return to Munich to complete his art education. In 1900, at the age of twenty-seven, Bartlett moved to Chicago where he rented a studio in the Fine Arts Building on Michigan Avenue. It was here that he received his first commissioned piece of art, a portrait that he was paid $75 upon its completion. An active and successful painter, Bartlett was committed to promoting the work of fellow contemporary artists, beginning in 1905, as a member of the Art Institute's Art Committee, and later, in 1916, as a founding member of the Arts Club of Chicago, a pioneering organization dedicated to the advancement of modern art. Dorfred House In 1902, the Bartletts moved into their new home at 2901 Prairie Avenue, Chicago.Great Houses of Chicago (1871‚Äì1921) by Susan Benjamin and Stuart Cohen, Acanthus Press, 2008, p. 218 This home, designed by Frost & Granger, would be named \\"Dorfred House\\", a combination of the names Dora and Fred. Constructed just two blocks away from his boyhood home on historic Prairie Avenue, the home boasted a studio measuring forty feet by twenty-five feet with a twenty foot high ceiling. Beyond the studio, the home offered a reception room known as the Pompeian Room, an Italian music room and library on the first floor with the kitchen, a Louis XVI dining room, laundry and servants rooms in the basement along with the upstairs private chambers, including bedrooms and powder rooms.ChicagoTribune.com March 11, 1906 The Prairie Avenue home of Frederic Clay Bartlett 2901 Prairie Avenue, Chicago, Illinois Works of art During his marriage to Dora, Bartlett was more active with his creativity regarding art, especially the creation of murals. In 1900, he was commissioned to create a mural for the Second Presbyterian Church in Chicago. After a fire destroyed the church, Bartlett and his friend, Howard Van Doren Shaw, integrated frescoes depicting the Tree of Life and a Heavenly Choir painted in the Byzantine manner. Bartlett followed this mural with a more personal endeavor in 1904. He completed a frieze in stained-glass depicting a medieval tournament procession for the Frank Dickinson Bartlett Memorial Gymnasium on the campus of the University of Chicago. The gym was a memorial to Bartlett's younger brother, Frank, who died of an appendicitis in 1900. Bartlett's father, Adolphus funded the construction of the facility while being a trustee for the university. An additional work by Bartlett, completed in 1909, were individual paintings that covered over fifty ceiling panels of the Michigan Room in the University Club of Chicago. On March 3, 1917, Bartlett's wife, Dora, died after nineteen years of marriage. Prior to Dora's death, Bartlett's son, Frederic Clay Bartlett Jr., was born on November 20, 1907. Bartlett Jr., who would be known as \\"Clay\\", would grow-up and become a talented artist and musician, however; he would unfortunately die at the age of forty-eight in 1955, only two years after the death of his father. =Helen Louise Birch= On January 22, 1919, Bartlett would marry his second wife, Helen Louise Birch, a close friend of Dora. Birch, born February 27, 1883, was thirty-six years old, compared to her husband who was forty-five. Prior to her marriage, Helen Birch was both a published composer and poet. She studied music with the German expatriate Bernhard Ziehn, a music theorist and teacher of harmony and composition in Chicago. She was an avid supporter of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the Chicago-based Poetry magazine. Helen Birch was the daughter of Maria Root Birch and Hugh Taylor Birch. After the Great Chicago Fire, Hugh Birch became a named partner in the law firm of Galt, Birch and Galt. In 1872, he would become the first State's Attorney of Cook County, Illinois and eventually move to the area that currently is Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Bonnet House Between May 1, 1893, and March 1920, Hugh Birch and Helen Birch Bartlett purchased hundreds of acres of Floridian land that would eventually become Hugh Taylor Birch State Park as well as the Bonnet House.BonnetHouse.org Construction of the Bonnet House, a plantation-style home, began in 1920 on land that was given to the Bartletts as a wedding gift from her father. Currently on the National Register of Historic Places, the Bonnet House was intended to be the location for the Bartlett family to spend their winters. However, due to their constant travels in Europe, the family would spend summer days in Lake Geneva while maintaining their apartment in Manhattan near Columbus Circle. Bonnet House, Fort Lauderdale, Florida Art Inspiration Helen Birch and Frederic Bartlett were married in Boston at a private ceremony attended only by Senator and Mrs. Albert Beveridge and Mrs. Marshall Field Sr., both relatives of Birch. For their honeymoon, the couple traveled throughout Asia, traveling to Japan, China and the Philippines. It was during this trip that Bartlett would be inspired to create twenty-one paintings that would be exhibited in the Art Institute's American Exhibitions of 1919 and 1920, as well as in his one-man exhibition at the Montross Gallery in New York City in 1921. Collections The Bartletts were a dynamic couple. From like upbringings, they had similar interests and played off each other's strengths. They were fixtures of Chicago's civic-minded elite during the early 1900s. Prior to their marriage, Frederic's art collection focused on a variety of sources, including antique, Renaissance, and 19th-century fine and decorative arts. In the early 1920s, their collecting activities became more focused. Leading a cosmopolitan lifestyle, the couple traveled regularly to Europe, where they acquired a collection of modern art. Concentrating on the contemporary French avant-garde, they purchased works by Andr√© Derain, Andr√© Dunoyer de Segonzac, Andr√© Lh√¥te, and Amedeo Modigliani. In the spring of 1923, they acquired Henri Matisse's, Woman Before an Aquarium. The following year, less than one year after Frederic succeeded his father as a trustee of the Art Institute, they acquired Georges Seurat's, Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. This purchase was made specifically with the museum in mind, at a time when the artist was not yet represented in any American or French public collection. Over the next several years, with the intention of placing La Grande Jatte in an appropriate artistic context, the Bartletts purchased major paintings by key Post-Impressionist artists Paul C√©zanne, Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, as well as important works by other modern masters, such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Rousseau. Memorial collection After only six-and-one-half years of marriage, Helen Birch Bartlett died of cancer on October 24, 1925. To honor his wife, Frederic presented their unique art collection to the Art Institute of Chicago in May 1926. A portion of the Helen Birch Bartlett Memorial Collection has been permanently displayed in the museum continuously since the donation. During the 1920s and 30's, Bartlett would swap-out paintings in order to add pieces that would be a better representation or example of the work or artists displayed. The twenty-five paintings in the collection are still in the possession of the Art Institute as well as other works from the same historical time-frame.Art Institute of Chicago Private collection In addition to the paintings in the Helen Birch Bartlett Memorial Collection, the Bartletts' private collection contained paintings by other modern European artists, among them Vlaminck, Dufy, Herbin, Foujita, de la Fresnaye, Valadon, Marcoussis, Severini, and Pascin, which were not part of the final donation to the Art Institute. Still others were by artists whose names are no longer easily recognized, such as Lotiron, Beaudin, Waroquier, Pruna, and Marmorek. Among the few Americans represented in the collection were John Mann and Charles Demuth, whose watercolors The Brook and Flowers, respectively, the Bartletts acquired in 1924. (While the present whereabouts of most of these works is not known, the aforementioned watercolors are in the Art Institute.) The Bartletts' lack of interest in collecting modern American art occurred despite the fact that Frederic was a founding member of the Art Institute's Friends of American Art, established in 1910 as the first organization in any museum to purchase current work by American artists for the collection. This group, which lasted into the 1940s, provided the Art Institute with the substance of its collection of twentieth-century American painting and sculpture but it tended to overlook the work of the American avant-garde. =Evelyn Fortune Lilly= Bartlett married Evelyn Fortune Lilly (1887‚Äì1997) of Indianapolis, Indiana, in June 1931. Following Helen Bartlett's death, the one-time acquaintances reunited in Beverly, Massachusetts. Bartlett was 58 years old; Lilly was 44. Evelyn Fortune was the oldest daughter of May (Knubbe) and William Fortune. Her father was president of a group of independent telephone companies that included the Indianapolis Telephone Company; a member of the board of directors of the pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly and Company from 1919 to 1927; a founder of the Indianapolis chapter of the American Red Cross in 1916; and served as the first president of the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce. See also: Evelyn married her high school sweetheart, Eli Lilly Jr. (1885‚Äì1977), on August 29, 1907. Evelyn Fortune's father and Eli Lilly's grandfather, Colonel Eli Lilly, and father, Josiah K. Lilly Sr., were one-time friends. The Lillys had two sons, one born in 1908 and the other in 1910, both of whom died in infancy. Their only surviving child was a daughter, Evelyn \\"Evie\\" (Lilly) Lutz (1918‚Äì70). Eli and Evelyn Lilly divorced in 1926.. See also: Artwork During his marriage to Evelyn, Frederic Bartlett's eyesight began to fail based on cataracts he had contracted. This affected his ability to paint, however; it heightened Evelyn's desire to create works of art. The couple gave up their Chicago apartment on Astor Street and their studio in the Fine Arts Building and moved to Massachusetts while wintering at the Bonnet House in Florida. They opened a studio in Munich, Germany and, with her husband's encouragement, Evelyn took up painting. She moved quickly from watercolors to oils and developed her own style. Her interests included vividly colored portraits, still lifes and flower paintings. Her creations bore little resemblance to her husband's murals, landscapes and figurative works, executed in muted tones. Memorial collection addition In 1932, Toulouse-Lautrec's \\"Ballet Dancers\\" was the final addition to the Helen Birch Bartlett Memorial Collection as well as the last painting acquired by Frederic Bartlett. Bartlett would continue to gift institutions with artwork, although none was comparable to the collection given to the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1942, Bartlett presented the Indianapolis Museum of Art with a bust of Senator Beveridge created by Paul Manship. The Museum of Modern Art was given Amedeo Modigliani's Bride and Groom. These would be the final museum gifts Bartlett would produce. Later life, death, legacy In the last decade of his life, Bartlett focused his attention to the beautification of his Florida estate. He suffered a partially disabling stroke in 1949 and four years later on June 25, 1953, he died due to complications from his stroke. In May 1954, the Art Institute staged a memorial exhibition comprising nearly twenty of his paintings. In subsequent years, Evelyn Bartlett would donate many paintings and sculptures to the Art Institute. Her interest in Chicago's art scene continued even after her husband's death. In 1982, the Smithsonian Institution organized a retrospective exhibition of the Bartletts' work that also traveled to the Art Institute.

The game is a spin-off of the Pok√©mon franchise, in which the player works with a talking Pikachu to solve various mysteries. A shorter, downloadable version of the game called was released in Japan in February 2016, while the full version was released worldwide in March 2018. In contrast to previous Pok√©mon role-playing games, Detective Pikachu is an adventure game spin-off focusing on narrative storytelling, with a presentation comparable to the Pok√©mon anime series. A live-action film adaptation was released in May 2019. That same year, a sequel was announced for the Nintendo Switch. Plot The game begins with a peculiar talking Pikachu, who, despite not being as powerful and nimble as other Pikachu of his kind, is rather intelligent and claims to be a great detective. One day, Pikachu encounters a boy named Tim Goodman, who is able to understand what he is saying. They are immediately put to the test with retrieving a stolen necklace from thieving Aipom. Afterwards, they head to Baker Detective Agency and meet Mike Baker and secretary Amanda Blackstone, both of whom were close to Harry Goodman, Tim's father and Pikachu's owner. Harry had gone missing following a mysterious car crash that happened the same time Pikachu got amnesia. Tim and Pikachu deduce that Harry was last seen trying to investigate Litwick Cave, and arrive just in time to rescue GNN reporter Meiko Okamoto and her assistant Emilia Christie from a rampaging Glalie, who seems to not remember why it was attacking to begin with. After escaping, Tim and Pikachu trace a clue to the Pok√©mon Comprehensive Laboratory. Posing as interns, they are introduced to the staff and are reunited with Emilia and Meiko, who together end up having to solve another rampaging Pok√©mon incident. They learn that employee Carlos Hernando had created a drug called \\"R\\" and has been using it to induce the rampages. After his arrest following an attempt to use R to chase them off, they learn that R was actually created by Dr. Waals, who now lives on Cappucci Island, but upon arriving learn that he is under arrest by overzealous lieutenant Brad McMaster for a supposed dangerous Pok√©mon that has been attacking the native wildlife. With Tim and Pikachu's help, they catch the real culprit, a tourist director who just wanted to possess Dr. Waals' home, and clear Waals' name. Waals reveals that R was supposed to be a miracle drug using the DNA of Mew, but by mistake the DNA came from Mewtwo, who has a \\"berserk gene\\" that causes the rampaging Pok√©mon. At Waals' advice, Tim and Pikachu head to the abandoned Fine Park where the first rampage occurred with a Charizard. The native Pok√©mon bring forth a locket that belonged to Harry and learn from a Buneary that a Skorupi had attacked him, resulting in him crashing his car. Tim and Pikachu head to the GNN building to meet with Meiko about the Fine Park footage of Charizard's rampage. When she leaves to go get it, Tim and Pikachu get involved in another mystery involving a down on his luck comedian trying to steal a violin from a competitor from a show he's hosting. They finally get to see the footage and discover that GNN assistant director Keith Norman had used a Skorupi to release R on Charizard at the park. Found out, Keith makes his escape on a Noivern, but Pikachu discovers that the locket left by Harry is actually a hidden camera full of photos taken from Ryme Wharf. Upon arriving, Tim and Pikachu spot a couple of shifty wharf employees and realize that they are keeping Waals' former assistant Simon Yen prisoner, and have been forcing him to mass-produce R. Pikachu suddenly remembers that he made a promise to Mewtwo to stop the creation of R, and Yen sneaks Tim and Pikachu onto the S.S. Prime Treasure, where R is apparently being sent. By coincidence, they run into Emilia and get caught up in another side mystery involving a stolen mask. Afterwards, they learn that a secret black market auction is happening and take part in it, discovering that Keith is there trying to sell R. They manage to catch him. As Tim and Emilia have a moment, Pikachu speaks privately with Mewtwo, who reveals that his promise is not over and that he still needs him to get rid of his cells. After looking through Keith's things they learn he is working for someone at GNN, and that they plan to release R during the Pok√©mon carnival. Tim, Pikachu and Emilia race back to the Baker Agency to inform them about the clues they have gathered. Realizing that the culprit plans to release R at Central Square during a parade, the group split up to look for clues. They capture and arrest a mysterious man in a yellow hat, but realize that R will be distributed from the clock tower, and find a large machine that they are able to successfully disarm. At that point, they realize that the culprit is GNN boss Roger Clifford, due to him mentioning that Pikachu does not have powers (something that only Keith knew). Roger reveals himself with Emilia as his hostage. He explains that he wanted to use R as a way to report on its disaster in Ryme City, making GNN more powerful and leading to them having total control of information. Tim and Pikachu rescue Emilia and defeat Roger and his Noivern. As Roger is taken away, Pikachu meets with Mewtwo to return the last of his cells. Pikachu then \\"makes a decision\\" and is put to sleep by Mewtwo. The next morning, Tim and Pikachu set off to look for Harry. Gameplay Detective Pikachu is an adventure game in which players control Tim Goodman as he works together with Detective Pikachu to solve various mysteries. This is accomplished by walking around scenes, finding potential clues, and speaking with people and Pok√©mon to uncover new information. Development Development on Detective Pikachu began in mid-2013. The game was first revealed in October 2013 during an episode of the Japanese television show The Professionals as part of a profile on The Pok√©mon Company CEO Tsunekazu Ishihara. NHK, the show's television network, leaked some information about the game on its website in advance of the show's airing. Early shots of the game depict a Pikachu in blue. Later that year, Nintendo filed a trademark for the name Great Detective Pikachu. The developers released a debut trailer in late January 2016, a week before the game's launch. In a 2018 interview, the creators of Detective Pikachu, which features a talking Pikachu, revealed that the original intention for the anime was to have the Pok√©mon talk, but OLM, Inc. were unable to come up with a concept that Game Freak were accepting of. In the game, Pikachu wears a deerstalker, taking inspiration from popular depictions of Sherlock Holmes. Release The game's initial version, called , was released on the Nintendo 3DS eShop in Japan on February 3, 2016. On January 12, 2018, this version of the game was removed from the eShop in Japan, and later that day it was announced that an expanded version of the game, simply titled Detective Pikachu, was scheduled for a physical Nintendo 3DS release worldwide on March 23, 2018. This version of the game featured nine chapters of story, as opposed to the three of the original release. On March 9, 2018, a Special Demo Version of the full game was released for free on the Nintendo 3DS eShop in Japan. The demo featured the first half of the first chapter of the game and allowed players to transfer their progress to the full game. This demo was later released in the West on April 5, 2018. Similarly, Japanese players who had completed the original download version of the game were able to start playing the full version from where they left off upon release. The game was released alongside a giant Detective Pikachu amiibo figure, which unlocks hints and optional cutscenes in the game. Following the Japanese release of the game, dedicated fans started a petition requesting American actor Danny DeVito as the English voice actor for the titular character. The petition gained 40,000 signatures, but DeVito declined to audition for the role saying he'd never even heard of Pok√©mon. To promote the release of the full version of the game, The Pok√©mon Company released a free promotional eBook called Detective Pikachu Episode 0 - Eevee's Case, available until May 15, 2018 on Apple's iBooks and Amazon's Kindle stores. The short story acts as a prequel to the game, setting up its story. The book was originally released in physical form as a pre-order bonus for the game in Japan. Alongside this, a set of stickers was also released for free on iMessage and Line on the same day. Reception In Japan, the game sold 121,423 units, including 94,203 retail sales and 27,220 digital eShop sales. On North America's NPD charts, it was the top-selling 3DS game in March 2018, and one of the top ten 3DS games during JuneJuly 2018. On the UK's multi- platform charts, it debuted at number 23 in its first week during March 2018, before rising to number 15 the following week with a 76% sales increase. It was also number 12 on the UK's 3DS platform chart in November 2018. Detective Pikachu received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Critics praised the game's presentation, storytelling, witty writing, voice cast, puzzles, and the two main characters themselves, Detective Pikachu and Tim Goodman. However, it was criticized for having mediocre gameplay, simplistic game mechanics, lack of difficulty, and short length. IGN gave the game a \\"great\\" score of 8.2 out of 10, calling it \\"a bold take on the iconic Pokemon, which succeeds thanks to Pika Prompts that build Pikachu beyond detective stereotypes\\" and concluded that it \\"gives great insight into the world of Pokemon through its fun mysteries and wonderful coffee-loving lead.\\" Ryan Craddock of Nintendo Life also gave the game a \\"great\\" score of 8 out of 10, stating that while the game was quite easy with no real penalty for incorrect decisions, \\"the game's art, storytelling, and genuinely likeable cast [showed] the world of Pok√©mon in a great new light\\". There was also praise given to the game's \\"gorgeous\\" visuals and the character of Detective Pikachu himself. Several critics felt the story would work better as a film than as a game. Eurogamer noted the game is more similar to the Pok√©mon anime series than previous Pok√©mon video games, and compared it to the Ace Attorney series of adventure games. Nintendoros also compared it to the manga and anime series Detective Conan. The game was nominated for \\"Nintendo Game of the Year\\" at the Golden Joystick Awards, and for \\"Game, Franchise Family\\" at the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards. Film adaptation A live-action film based around the Detective Pikachu character by Warner Bros. Pictures was released on May 10, 2019 and grossed $433 million worldwide. It was directed by Rob Letterman, and stars Justice Smith, Kathryn Newton, Suki Waterhouse, Omar Chaparro, Chris Geere, Ken Watanabe and Bill Nighy, with Ryan Reynolds as the voice of Pikachu. The film began pre- production in 2017, and was filmed in London in 2018. The film version makes numerous changes. While the basic premise is still the same, the conditions were very different. Tim is a 21-year-old insurance salesman who leaves his grandmother to collect his father's assets as opposed to the game where he is an 18-year-old who leaves home to look for his father following his disappearance. The Hi-Hat Caf√©, Pok√©mon Comprehensive Laboratory, Ryme Wharf and GNN (renamed CNM) are present, but are not given as much focus as they do in the game. Roger Clifford is changed to being the CEO of Clifford Industries which is founded by his father Howard, who is the real villain, while Roger himself is innocent. Howard's plan involved using Mewtwo to fuse all Pok√©mon with humans in an effort to \\"help\\" humanity evolve rather than just making GNN powerful in an effort to control information. The film character of Lucy Stevens is an amalgam of Emilia Christie and Meiko Okamoto, neither of whom had a Pok√©mon partner in the game. The character of Keith Norman is replaced with Ms. Norman, who in turn is a Ditto taking on human form. Pikachu is in fact Harry who was fused with his Pok√©mon by Mewtwo. This seems to be only implied in the game where Harry's disappearance is left completely unresolved. The drug R still causes Pok√©mon to become erratic and violent, but its purpose went from being used as a super drug to it being used so that Mewtwo can more easily manipulate the affected Pok√©mon. Sequel Weeks after the film adaptation's release, The Pok√©mon Company announced in a press conference that a Detective Pikachu sequel is being developed for the Nintendo Switch. The sequel will reportedly feature a completely different resolution from what the film version portrayed.

It was discovered on 13 May 1971, by Dutch astronomer couple Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten at Leiden, on photographic plates taken by Dutch‚ÄìAmerican astronomer Tom Gehrels at the Palomar Observatory in California, United States.  Orbit and classification  Nemrut Dagi as a member of the Hungaria family, which form the innermost dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar System. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.7‚Äì2.0 AU once every 2 years and 6 months (922 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.10 and an inclination of 19¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. Due to its perihelion of less than 1.668 AU, Nemrut Dagi is classified as a Mars-crosser by the Lightcurve Data Base, while in JPL's data base, which requires a perihelion of less than 1.666 AU, the asteroid is simply an inner main-belt asteroid. The asteroid's observation arc begins 18 years prior to its official discovery observation, with its identification at Palomar Observatory in February 1953. = Survey designation = The survey designation \\"T-1\\" stands for the first Palomar‚ÄìLeiden Trojan survey, named after the fruitful collaboration of the Palomar and Leiden Observatory in the 1960s and 1970s. Gehrels used Palomar's Samuel Oschin telescope (also known as the 48-inch Schmidt Telescope), and shipped the photographic plates to Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten at Leiden Observatory where astrometry was carried out. The trio are credited with the discovery of several thousand asteroid discoveries.  Physical characteristics = Lightcurves = In December 2015, a rotational lightcurve of Nemrut Dagi was obtained by American astronomer Brian Warner at his CS3‚ÄìPalmer Divide Station () in California. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.08 magnitude (), indicating that the body has a rather spheroidal shape. The results supersede previous observations made by Warner and by Brian A. Skiff, which gave similar results (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid has an exceptionally high albedo of 0.46 and a diameter of 3.6 kilometers, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumed a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20, and correspondingly, calculates a much larger diameter of 5.3 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 13.8.  Naming  This minor planet was named after the a dormant volcano Nemrut (Nemrut Daƒüƒ±) in Turkey. It is the most western volcano of a group of volcanoes near Lake Van in Eastern Anatolia. The volcano is named after King Nimrod who is said to have ruled this area in about 2100 BC. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 6 April 2012 ().

The film is co-starred by Argentinian-Spanish actress Imperio Argentina. The script was written by the Brazilian Alfredo Le Pera. Gardel sings two songs with Le Pera, Memory malevo and Want to me, the latter was never recorded on film. It premiered on May 19, 1933 in the Cinema Suipacha of Buenos Aires. The originals of the film have been lost and only audio recordings have survived in Vitaphone disks.  Context  In 1931, Carlos Gardel was hired by the American company Paramount to make his first sound motion picture, Lights of Buenos Aires. The film was made in the studio that Paramount had in Joinville- him-Pont, 40 kilometers southwest of the French capital, devoted to produce films for the non-American markets. The following year, however, the French Paramount found itself in full crisis, in the context of the world-wide depression and a difficult political climate a few months before Hitler took power in Germany. In spite of this, after the first half of 1932 had gone by without news and Gardel went back to Buenos Aires, the company decided to make new films with the Argentinian singer. Within this larger project, the feature film Wait for Me was filmed in September 1932. The French director Louis Gasnier was assigned the project, with a script adapted from an American script. The film was scheduled to begin shooting in September 1932 with the title Wait for Me. Immediately after the filming of Wait for Me ended, Paramount summoned the French director Lucien Jaquelux and the consecrated Argentinian-Spanish actress Imperio Argentina to make the short film titled The House is Serious, filmed during the month of October 1932. Once the short film was finished, Paramount filmed Melody of suburb, Gardel's third French feature film. Brazilian Alfredo Le Pera begun to get along with Gardel in December of the previous year. Le Pera assumed the functions of screenwriter and songwriter, whose melody composed Gardel. All the copies of the film have been lost, including the originals that were destroyed in 1940, during the Second World War when the German troops bombed the studies of the Paramount in Joinville.

Early years and education Mike Egan was born to Elise (Robider) and Michael Joseph Egan on August 8, 1926, in Savannah, Georgia. The grandson of an Irish immigrant, the Egans had resided in Savannah for generations. Egan attended elementary school taught by the Marist Brothers. He left home to attended prep school in Portsmouth, Rhode Island at Portsmouth Priory School, and graduated from there in 1945. He never again resided in Savannah. That same year, Egan was drafted into the U.S. Army in the concluding year of World War II and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant, serving in the 86th Infantry Division. Egan was discharged in 1947, after the war's end, and enrolled in Yale University, graduating in 1950. With the advent of the Korean War, Egan was promoted to the rank of First Lieutenant and recalled to active duty, serving in the 2nd Infantry Division until his discharge in 1952. He then entered Harvard Law School, receiving his law degree in 1955. Returning to Georgia, Egan set up a law practice in Atlanta. Political career Prior to 1965, Georgia politics had been dominated by the Democratic party for nearly 100 years. However, after the 1965 legislative session, a mandated reapportionment took place which began Georgia's transition to two-party representation. A court decision struck down the County Unit System which had been disproportionately favorable to rural Democrats, requiring the General Assembly to re-draw legislative districts. It opened up opportunities for urban Republicans. Egan seized upon that opportunity and ran for political office in 1965 as a Republican in a Metropolitan Atlanta district. Egan was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives, where he served from 1966 to 1977. In 1977, Egan resigned from the Georgia House of Representatives and began service with the United States Department of Justice when he was appointed to the position of United States Associate Attorney General, by President Jimmy Carter. In 1979, after two years with Justice, Egan resumed his law practice. In 1988, he ran for a seat in the Georgia State Senate in a special election, to replace Senator Paul Coverdell who was appointed to the position of Director of the Peace Corps by President George H.W. Bush on May 2, 1989. Egan was elected to Coverdell's vacated Senate seat in June, 1989. He served in the Senate, representing District 40 in Metropolitan Atlanta from 1989 to 2001.New Georgia Encyclopedia Mike EganMichael Joseph Egan-obituaryGeorgia General Assembly- Michael J. Egan Egan's willingness to occasionally support an unpopular cause, driven to do so by his own set of ethics, won the respect of colleagues, Republicans and Democrats alike. He became known as \\"the conscience of the senate\\" by his Republican colleagues. Later years After his legislature career ended, Egan, who had retired from active practice with the Atlanta law firm of Sutherland Asbill and Brennan, continued his affiliation with the firm in \\"as counsel\\" capacity. In 2001 he was one of the first people appointed to the newly created Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District by Governor Roy Barnes.

Her artworks are usually signed St John Cadell, disguising her femininity. Life She was born in Cheltenham on 14 August 1877, the third of four daughters to Col George Cadell (1844‚Äì1909) and his wife Mary Amelia Morison McCrae (1844‚Äì1924). Her father was a colonel in the East India Company. Florence was named after aunt Florence Cadell who had adopted the name St John Cadell after marrying Berkeley Craven St John. She was a distant cousin of the Scottish artist Francis Cadell. Her elder sister, Agnes Morison Cadell (1873‚Äì1958) was also an artist. The family moved as a group to Scotland around 1896, following the death of the eldest sister, Mary Eliza Cadell, and only brother William Farquhar Cadell (1874‚Äì1894). Florence appears to have tried to distance herself from her overtly upper class English roots, and often alleged an Australian birth. Her personal viewpoint quickly awoke to a personal identification as ‚ÄúScottish‚Äù, and she was clearly a nationalist in her political views. Florence began exhibiting in the Royal Scottish Academy in 1900 and continued until 1965. Early work focussed on goats (which she kept at her house). In the 1920s Florence and Agnes jointly rebuilt Whinmill Brae House in Edinburgh as an artist‚Äôs studio. This still exists, in a hidden rural location on the Water of Leith between Donaldson's School and Dean Village. The pair spent some time in Crail in Fife and their work took on many of the picturesque themes of this fishing village. This period included short trips to other picturesque historic Fife villages, such as Culross. From 1956, Florence‚Äôs close artist friend Wendy Wood came to live with her and share her Edinburgh studio at Whinmill Brae. The house is now split in two and addressed as 17 and 18 Coltbridge Gardens. They had a joint exhibition of art in 1963.Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Women: Wendy Wood, by Ewan, Innes and Reynolds She died on 30 January 1966 and is buried very close to her home, in Dean Cemetery. The grave lies in the north section. She is buried with both her parents, Agnes and her youngest sister, Muriel McCrae Cadell (1887‚Äì1931). The grave faces south on the south path of the Victorian north extension. The grave describes her as Scottish Patriot and bears lines from verse 7 of Psalm 124 ‚Äúeven as a bird out of the fowler‚Äôs snare‚Äù: a reference to escaping the troubles of life.

The Christian Walls of Madrid, also known as Medieval Walls, were built in the Spanish city of Madrid between the 11th and 12th centuries, once the city passed to the Crown of Castile. They were built as an extension of the original walled enclosure (9th century), of Muslim origin, to accommodate the new districts which emerged after the Reconquista. With the establishment of the Court in 1561, it fell into disuse, demolished almost entirely. Still standing are some remains integrated into the structure of various buildings of El Madrid de los Austrias, a name designating the Habsburgs's historic center of the city. The most important are in the calles (streets) of los Mancebos, of Don Pedro, of del Almendro, of Escalinata, of del Espejo, of de Mes√≥n de Pa√±os and of the Cava Baja and as in Plaza de Isabel II and in the underground parking of the Plaza de Oriente. The remains that are still standing were declared a Historical and Artistic Monument in 1954.  History  Cloth of the Walls in the Calle Escalinata (near the Plaza de Isabel II). The tradition attributes to the King Alfonso VII of Le√≥n and Castile (1126‚Äì1157) its construction, although it is assumed that work began before his reign, in the years immediately following the Christian conquest of Madrid (1083), during the times of Alfonso VI of Le√≥n and Castile (1040‚Äì1109). At the beginning of the 13th century, the Walls were not yet completed, as stated in the Fuero de Madrid of 1202: \\"all the calo√±as of the Council invest in the works of the Walls until finished\\". Various municipal documents suggest that could be completed in the second decade of the 13th century. Pedro Teixeira (1656) some remains of the Christian Walls were noted, as in the case of this fortification located between the calles of Almendro and of Cava Baja. The defensive role the Walls played after the Reconquista, as consolidation of the places snatched by the Christians to the Muslims, and in the process of Christian repopulation was blurring in the 14th century and, especially in the 15th century. The remarkable urban growth experienced by Madrid, with the development of new suburbs beyond the city walls, led to their demolition, especially after the 16th century, with the designation of the city as the capital of Spain.  Features  Commemorative placard located at the confluence of the calles de la Uni√≥n and de Vergara, where it is remember that, around that place, was the Puerta de Valnad√∫.

The Christian Walls of Madrid protected an area of just over , as eight times larger than the space within the primitive Muslim Walls, of about . The total length was . Unlike the Arab walled enclosure, built in quadrangular towers, the Christian structure was articulated from semicircular keep towers on layers of flint. The properties of this stone (which, when struck, causes sparks) gave rise to one of the historic city slogans: \\"I was on water built, my walls are of fire.\\" It is estimated that there could have been between 130 and 140 towers, one every . The Walls were surrounded by an outer moat, along most of the perimeter, and as supports the toponymy of some Madrilenian routes. The calles of Cava Alta, of Cava Baja and of Cava de San Miguel were drawn on this pit or cava, after it was covered. It included four gates, constructed in turn, each protected by the proximity of one or more strong towers. There are not preserved any archaeological remains of them: * The Puerta de Guadalajara, was the main gate of the city and the most sumptuous, given its location in a place of great commercial transit, located at the height of the number 49 of current Calle Mayor. It consisted of two large towers, across which stretched the entrance arch. The emperor Carlos V, Holy Roman Emperor (1500‚Äì1558) directed, in 1535, the demolition of the original Medieval gate and replaced it with a new one, with three arches and more ornamental, which disappeared in a fire that occurred on September 2, 1582. * The Puerta de Valnad√∫ (in other fonts, Balnad√∫) was possibly located in the center of the block defined by the calles of Lepanto, Carlos III and Vergara, near the Teatro Real. * The Puerta de Moros, opened at south of the present Plaza del Humilladero, between the calles of Almendro and Cava Baja. It was destroyed in 1412 during an uprising. * The Puerta Cerrada, located in the Plaza de Puerta Cerrada, was initially called Puerta de la Culebra, for the relief of a dragon carved on it. The name has come down to us after being closed, given the frequent crimes and assaults that took place inside. It was flanked by the Tower del Vinagre and was demolished in 1569, on the occasion of the entry into the city of Elisabeth of Valois, wife of Philip II. At these accesses are added the three gates of the primitive Muslim Walls: the Arc de Santa Mar√≠a, the Puerta de la Vega, and Puerta de la Sagra. Along the Walls were built several albarrana towers and watchtowers, which had a strategic location. These included the Tower de Alzapierna or de Gaona, that had a mandate to monitor sources Ca√±os del Peral (in the current Plaza de Isabel II). The Tower de los Huesos, built in the 11th century by the Muslim population, was incorporated into the Christian Walls to protect the Puerta de Valnad√∫. The remains of the latter are exhibited in the underground car park of the Plaza de Oriente. = Most relevant remains = The most important remains of the Christian Walls of Madrid are integrated in various buildings and urban infrastructures.

Before the assault, government troops issued a deadline to the rebels to surrender, which was ignored. By the next day, the Army captured the village, and immediately started to shell the nearby rebel-held village of Harbinafsah, in preparation for an assault there as well. On 13 January, the Army temporarily seized Harbinafsah, but withdrew 24 hours later, positioning themselves on its northern outskirts. In the night between 14 and 15 January, following heavy fighting, an agreement was reached between government forces and the citizens of Deir al-Fardis, leading to the Army's capture of the village.

On 18 January, the military once again entered the northern part of Harbinafsah. The same day, Islamist rebels posted images on social media of beheaded soldiers in the contested village. The next day, the rebels reportedly seized the al-Bashakir factory checkpoint on the outskirts of Harbinfsah. On 20 January, the Army renewed its offensive and captured the al-Madajen area north of Harbinfsah, while also reportedly advancing into the southern part of the nearby village of Al-Zarrah.

In 2004, she was awarded the Lord Rhaburn Music Award as a dance ambassador and in 2009 she received the Chatoyer Recognition Award from the National Garifuna Council of Belize for her efforts at preserving Garifuna culture. Biography Baltazar was born on 16 August 1960 in Livingston, Guatemala to Enes and Merejilda Baltazar and was raised in Punta Gorda, Belize, attending St. Peter Claver Primary School. She continued her education at St. Peter Claver College, which is now the Toledo Community College. As a teenager, she moved to Belize City, Belize. From an early age she determined to become a dancer and at the beginning of the 1980s she started her professional career with the Leo Mar Dance Group. She was discovered by an American dance instructor and offered a scholarship to train at the Sarasota Ballet Arts School in Sarasota, Florida. The 6-month seminar was attended by four Belizean dancers and when they returned to Belize, they continued to practice together. This group would be the core of dancers who in 1990 co-founded the Belize National Dance Company, for which Baltazar served as assistant artistic director. In her various capacities with the National Dance Company, Baltazar not only appeared in hundreds of shows, but also choreographed routines, created concepts, and planned and organized performances. Baltazar later studied at the National Dance Theatre Company of Jamaica. Continuing her education, she trained at the Ballet Folkl√≥rico de M√©xico. Initially, her style focused on the Afro-Caribbean dances, such as punta, hungu hungu, gunjei, paranda, and punta, but her training gave her a basis in classical, folk and modern dance styles, which she was later able to incorporate into both her choreography and teaching. Baltazar served as the director and developer of the junior dance companies which operate as branches of the National Dance Company. In 1998, she established the San Pedro Dance Company followed two years later by The Caye Caulker Dance Company. The Caye Caulker school was founded by Baltazar and Cuban dancer Mariela Rodriguez to teach dance to island children. In addition to her work with the National Dance Company, Baltazar was a traveling teacher, providing dance instruction both privately and at public schools such as Grace Primary School, Holy Redeemer Primary School, St. Ignatius School, St. Joseph's School in Belize City and Pan Cotto School in Sandhill. In 2004, Baltazar, along with fellow founder of the National Dance Company, Althea Sealy, was awarded the Lord Rhaburn Music Award as dance ambassadors. In 1997, Baltazar choreographed the dance for Costa Maya Festival contestants of the Reina de la Costa Maya Pageant, which led to her continued involvement in choreographing the event. Baltazar was invited in 2001 to serve as a facilitator for a Garifuna Heritage Summer Camp held on St. Vincent as part of a heritage reclamation project. Becoming one of the founders of the Garifuna Heritage Foundation in St. Vincent, she taught both language and dance to Garinagu descendants on the island. She taught both modern and Garifuna folk dancing on St. Vincent for many years and in 2009 was awarded the Chatoyer Recognition Award by the National Garifuna Council of Belize for her endeavors to preserve and protect Garifuna culture. Throughout her career, Baltazar traveled abroad widely, including a trip with Andy Palacio to Malaysia in 2002; and performances throughout the Caribbean, in Costa Rica, Cuba, France, Mexico, Spain and the United States. While touring in Spain in September 2012, Baltazar was diagnosed with breast cancer and sought treatment in England. Members of the Company performed in benefits to assist in raising funds for Baltazar's treatment and her cancer went into remission. Refusing to stop working, Baltazar continued to perform and teach. Her last solo performance occurred on 6 April 2015 in a dance entitled ‚ÄúOur Father‚Äù and a few months prior to her death, she had opened a dance studio in Ladyville. Baltazar died on 6 July 2015 at her home in the Los Lagos neighborhood of Ladyville. Posthumously, she was honored with the Belizean Meritorious Service Award during the September Celebrations in 2015.

It hosts the annual Muscatine County Fair. The Muscatine County Historic Preservation Commission received a grant from the State of Iowa to study the fairgrounds in 2014. Most of it was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places as the West Liberty Fairgrounds Historic District in 2015. At the time of its nomination it consisted of 42 resources, which included 16 contributing buildings, two contributing sites, two contributing structures, 16 non-contributing buildings, and six non- contributing structures. Historic tax credits will be used to rehabilitate the historic buildings on the fairgrounds. History The Union District Agricultural Society began holding fairs in southwest Cedar County in 1863, and transferred them to West Liberty in 1871. The West Liberty Park Association was established three years later and bought the first for the society in 1875. Additional land, which makes up the historic district, was purchased in 1889 and 1963. The initial wood frame buildings were replaced by some of the present buildings beginning in 1915 with the Exhibition Hall. County fairs in rural areas were a showcase of livestock, agricultural products, home economics, and craftwork. Youth participation began to increase in the 1910s, the result of practical rural education. Structures geared to their activities were built beginning in the 1930s. As demand grew at about the same time for spectator space along the race track, a new grandstand was built in 1928. Because the size of the exhibitions grew in the mid-20th century, new and larger exhibition space was added in the 1960s, which included a new livestock judging pavilion in 1966. The race track initially sponsored horse racing throughout the summer months. The stalls and track were used for rental and training purposes. They were eventually replaced by auto races. In addition to the races and the fair, various other events are held at the fairgrounds. They include family reunions, picnics, holiday celebrations, and other community events.

Although noted to have some benefits in experimental models in animals, this is still an experimental procedure in humans and initial evidence from small studies have not been replicated in larger clinical trials. Successive clinical trials have failed to identify evidence supporting a protective role in humans.Remote Ischemic Preconditioning and Outcomes of Cardiac Surgery. NEJM. October 5, 2015. The procedure involves repeated, temporary cessation of blood flow to a limb to create ischemia (lack of oxygen and glucose) in the tissue. This \\"conditioning\\" activates the body's natural protective physiology against reperfusion injury and the tissue damage caused by low oxygen levels‚Äîa protection present in many mammals. RIC essentially mimics the cardio-protective effects of exercise; in fact, exercise can be considered a form of RIC in which the stimulus is distant from the organ being protected. RIC has been termed \\"exercise in a device\\", especially suited for patients who are unable or unwilling to work out. History The phenomenon of ischemic preconditioning (IPC) was discovered in 1986 by C. E. Murry and colleagues, who observed that repeated, temporary cross-clamping of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) in dogs protected the LAD territory of the heart against a subsequent prolonged ischemic event, reducing infarct size by 75%. This was thought to be a local effect and was termed local ischemic preconditioning. The phenomenon was confirmed by other researchers in dogs, pigs, mice, and rats. In 1993, Karin Przyklenk and colleagues began using the term \\"remote\\" when they observed that cross- clamping on the right side of the heart (right circumflex artery) protected the left side of the heart (LAD territory) from ischemia: that is, the protective trigger was remote from the observed effect. Other researchers confirmed this remote effect and found that performing the preconditioning protocol on kidney or gastrointestinal tissue also provided protection to the heart. In 2002, Raj Kharbanda and Andrew Redington, working at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, showed that non-invasively stopping and starting blood flow in the arm provided the same protection as invasive preconditioning of the heart. This adaptation of the RIC protocol significantly improved its safety and applicability, and resulted in a surge of clinical interest in the technique. Clinical trials More than 10,000 patients worldwide have completed clinical trials involving RIC, and another 20,000 are enrolled in ongoing trials. The first human clinical trial of RIC was conducted by Dr. Redington in pediatric patients undergoing heart surgery at the Hospital for Sick Children. The patients treated with RIC prior to surgery exhibited less heart damage, as measured by the biomarker troponin, as well as less need for supportive drugs. This trial was followed by others measuring the effects of RIC on rates and outcomes of heart attacks, heart failure, stroke, and cardiothoracic intervention. =Heart attacks= In multiple randomized controlled trials, remote ischemic conditioning reduced infarct size in ST- elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients when used in the ambulance or emergency department as an adjunct therapy to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or when used with thrombolytic drugs. In seven trials comprising 2,372 STEMI patients, infarct size‚Äîa measure of damage to the heart‚Äîwas reduced by 17‚Äì30% on average, and the reduction was greatest (~60%) in the largest infarcts. Further analysis of a Danish study (CONDI-1), in which patients were treated in the ambulance, showed that those who received RIC did not show a decline in myocardial salvage index (a measure of a healthy heart) when they experienced a delay in treatment, while the control group experienced a significant decline in salvage index. The RIC treatment therefore resulted, effectively, in an extension of the \\"golden hour\\", the period in which medical treatment for heart attacks is most effective. Infarct size is a predictor of future cardiovascular events as well as mortality, and researchers doing long-term follow-up on STEMI patients treated with RIC found that the reduction in heart damage at the time of the heart attack resulted in clinical improvement four years later: MACCE (major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular event) rates were reduced by 47% (13.5% vs. 25.6%, p=0.018). This improvement resulted in mean cumulative cardiovascular medical care costs that were ‚Ç¨2,763 lower in the RIC-treated group than in the control group (‚Ç¨12,065 vs. ‚Ç¨14,828)‚Äîsavings of approximately 20%. There are currently two large randomized controlled trials of RIC treatment in STEMI patients ongoing in Europe, both of which will examine the effects of RIC treatment on coronary death and hospitalization for heart failure after one year. =Percutaneous coronary intervention= Remote ischemic conditioning significantly reduced heart damage (as measured by troponin elevations) in four randomized controlled trials involving 816 elective (non-emergency) PCI patients. The myocardial damage and troponin elevations seen in elective PCI patients are less than that in emergency STEMI patient, because there is less acute reperfusion injury in elective PCI, and damage instead results from distal embolization and side-branch occlusion. Nevertheless, myocardial damage during elective PCI remains a significant predictor of morbidity and mortality, as patients exhibiting any increase in troponin are at a significantly increased risk of future cardiovascular events. Researchers at Papworth Hospital in Cambridge conducted the first large study of RIC in elective PCI patients (the CRISP study) and found that patients treated with RIC prior to stenting showed a 62% reduction in troponin levels, less chest discomfort, and reduced six- month hospitalization rates. Long-term follow-up of the CRISP study showed that this single RIC treatment resulted in a 35% reduction in six-year MACCE rates. =Cardiac and oncological imaging= RIC has been shown to reduce Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) and contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI), two serious complications that can occur when patients are given contrast media during imaging or invasive procedures such as angioplasty or percutaneous aortic valve replacement. The incidence of CIN is 13% in an unselected population and can be as much as 57% in patients with poor kidney function and congestive heart failure. The development of CIN after percutaneous coronary intervention is independently associated with an increased risk of short- and long-term ischemic and hemorrhagic events. RIC provided a statistically significant benefit in five randomized clinical trials comprising 480 patients. The first report was in an observational study of patients in the United States, and the first randomized clinical trial to show a benefit in patients at extremely high risk of injury (those with Stage 3 or 4 kidney disease, diabetes, or heart failure) was done in Germany. The German study showed a reduced incidence of CIN (a 70% reduction, from 40% to 12%, p=0.002), with no patients in the treated arm needing in-hospital dialysis (compared with 14% in the control group), and reduced six-week readmission rates (a 60% reduction, from 36% to 14%). Similar protection was seen in cancer patients undergoing contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT): Researchers found a 35% reduction in CIN across the population, and the patients at highest risk benefited the most, with a 60% reduction. These results, confirmed in subsequent clinical trials involving cardiac patients, show that RIC can protect the kidneys as well as the heart. =Coronary surgery= Yetgin and colleagues conducted a systematic review and analysis of RIC in cardiac surgery, examining thirteen trials involving 891 patients, and found that RIC treatment reduced troponin levels by 21% to 49%. In addition, they concluded that trials in which the primary measure was a validated biomarker (e.g., 72-hour cardiac troponin AUC) showed a benefit from RIC treatment, while trials in which a non-validated biomarker (e.g., 24-hour troponin AUC) was the primary measure did not show a benefit. In the first prospectively designed trial to examine the effect of RIC on clinical outcomes in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), Thielmann and colleagues showed that RIC treatment reduced troponin levels and improved long-term morbidity and mortality. However, while patients who received the anesthetic isoflurane benefited from the treatment, the anesthetic propofol blocked the effects of RIC. Investigations in Dr. Gerd Heusch's lab showed that propofol abolishes the phosphorylation of STAT5, a key survival molecule that is activated by RIC. Two other trials in CABG surgery (ERICCA and RIP-HEART) reported neutral results for the clinical benefit of RIC, but both of these trials used propofol as the initiating anesthetic. In a viewpoint letter that followed the publication of the ERICCA and RIP-HEART trials, Heusch and Dr. Bernard Gersh wrote that the use of propofol rather than volatile anesthesia appeared to be a common denominator in all studies that failed to find protection with RIC. A 2015 trial in high-risk CABG patients showed a reduced incidence of surgical acute kidney injury in RIC-treated patients (37.5% vs. 52.5%, p=0.02), a reduced need for dialysis, and shorter stays in the intensive care unit. This study did not use propofol, and a three-month follow-up found that RIC treatment improved clinical outcomes. Emerging applications Researchers are working to expand the clinical applications of RIC beyond cardiovascular indications. Because RIC modifies the expression of genes involved in inflammation, coagulation, and complement pathways, researchers believe repeated treatments (chronic conditioning) could aid recovery or prevent disease progression in a variety of chronic conditions. The areas of research that are most advanced are in heart failure and stroke recovery. =Heart failure= Despite advances in the treatment of heart attacks, survivors are at a significant risk of heart failure and death within five years because of adverse remodeling processes in the heart. The acute inflammatory process that occurs soon after a heart attack is necessary for healing and scar formation, but can be harmful if it continues for an extended period of time. Continued oxidative stress results in inflammation, death of heart cells, fibrosis of the ventricles, and hypertrophy (enlargement) of the heart, progressing to heart failure. Studies show that repeated daily RIC treatments lead to significant downregulation of neutrophil activation and proinflammatory responses in humans, and could reduce post-heart-attack inflammation. In rodent models of post-heart-attack heart failure, daily RIC treatment for 28 days resulted in reduced markers of inflammation (including TGF-b), improved ventricular function, and improved survival over 100 days, in a dose-dependent manner. This study provided the scientific rationale for the CRIC-RCT clinical trial (NCT01817114). There are two other ongoing randomized controlled trials of chronic conditioning in heart-failure patients: NCT01664611 and NCT02248441. =Neurological indications= In addition to its efficacy in cardiological settings, RIC is thought to remotely recruit neuroprotective pathways, and its safety, feasibility, and low cost give it high potential in a wide variety of neurological conditions. Like the heart, the brain has self- protective abilities and can adapt to stress and injury (e.g., hypoxia or ischemia) by activating cellular protective pathways. RIC not only confers protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury, but also increases cerebral blood flow, which may contribute to the neuroprotective effect.  Stroke  The first randomized trial of RIC in acute stroke patients was done by Hougaard and colleagues in Denmark. Compared with standard treatment, RIC increased tissue survival after one month and reduced the risk of infarction in high-risk tissue. Two randomized trials of RIC have also been conducted in patients with intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS), a significant risk factor for stroke with a high risk of recurrence. The first‚Äîwhich included 68 Chinese patients under the age of 80 who had intracranial arterial stenosis of 50‚Äì99% and had experienced a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the previous 30 days‚Äîevaluated the effects of 300 days of brief, repetitive, bilateral arm ischemic conditioning on stroke recurrence. It found that the conditioning reduced the incidence of recurrent stroke from 23.3% to 5% at 90 days, and from 26.7% to 7.9% at 300 days; it also improved the rate of recovery (measured with the modified Rankin scale) and cerebral perfusion. The second trial examined the effect of 180 days of RIC on symptomatic ICAS in Chinese people aged 80‚Äì95 years, as invasive stenting is not always suitable for elderly patients, and less-invasive methods are needed. RIC safely prevented stroke and TIA recurrence and reduced inflammation in these patients.  Cerebral infarction  Delayed cerebral infarction after subarachnoid hemorrhage is a major cause of morbidity. Two Phase I clinical trials have shown that RIC after subarachnoid hemorrhage is feasible, safe, and well tolerated, and can prevent delayed neurological deficits.  Traumatic brain injury  Traumatic brain injury (TBI) shares many pathophysiological pathways with acute stroke, and ischemic preconditioning increases the brain's resistance to injury. Animal models of stroke (both open-skull and closed-skull models) show that RIC improves cerebral blood flow; reduces ischemic injury, edema, and cell death; and improves functional outcomes. A small randomized clinical trial in severe TBI also showed that patients who received RIC had lower levels of brain injury biomarkers.  Vascular cognitive impairment  Reduced cerebral blood flow is an early finding in vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). Cardiovascular risk factor control is currently the only management option for VCI, but observational studies suggest that exercise slows down cognitive decline. In a mouse model that reproduced the damage seen in patients with VCI (white matter damage, cerebral hypoperfusion, inflammation, blood‚Äìbrain barrier damage, and cognitive deficits), daily RIC for two weeks increased cerebral blood flow, and this increase persisted for one week after cessation of conditioning. Moreover, mice that underwent RIC had less inflammation, less white and gray matter damage, less Œ≤‚Äëamyloid deposition, and improved cognition. Timing and protocol The RIC stimulus can be applied to different tissues in the body. Either the upper limb (arm) or the lower limb (leg) may be used; however, because it is easier and more comfortable, most clinical trials use the upper limb. Researchers investigating the optimal dosing for the RIC stimulus have concluded that the upper limb is superior to the lower limb, that RIC on one limb generates an equivalent response to RIC on two limbs, and that maximal benefit occurs at 4‚Äì6 cycles. =Timing= The non-invasiveness and ease of application of RIC have allowed it to be studied in more situations than the original, invasive ischemic preconditioning, which was only realistically applicable in elective surgery. Studies have examined the effects of RIC applied at different times: * Pre-conditioning: RIC is applied within the hour prior to an intervention (e.g., elective cardiothoracic and surgical procedures) * Per-conditioning: RIC is applied at the time of the ischemic event (e.g., evolving heart attack, acute stroke, or trauma) * Chronic conditioning: RIC is applied daily for a period of time after an ischemic event (e.g., after a heart attack or stroke, or in chronic conditions such as peripheral vascular disease or ulcerative colitis) The term \\"post- conditioning\\" is used to describe short, intermittent inflations of an intra- coronary balloon at the time of reperfusion, and does not refer to RIC on a limb. Delayed post-conditioning is synonymous with chronic conditioning. =Manual vs. automated conditioning= Remote ischemic conditioning on the limb is mostly done by healthcare professionals, using a manual blood-pressure cuff and a stopwatch. The standard RIC protocol, used in the majority of clinical trials, consists of four cycles of five minutes of inflation at 200mmHg, followed by five minutes of deflation. This is the original conditioning protocol described by Murry et al. based on examinations of energetic depletion of the cell. =Automated conditioning= One automated device is approved in Europe and Canada for the delivery of remote ischemic conditioning: the autoRIC Device, which delivers four cycles of five minutes of inflation at 200mm Hg followed by five minutes of deflation to the upper limb. In a comparative study of this device and manual conditioning, the autoRIC Device was shown to be much easier to use.

In 2015, he set a record for a worldwide Big year of birding, seeing 6,042 of the world's estimated 10,400 bird species in a continuous journey spanning all seven continents from January 1 to December 31, 2015. Background Born in Eugene, Oregon, he grew up on rural property in the forest outside the small town of Creswell, Oregon. There he watched and photographed birds, learned their habits and calls, and taught himself to find their nests. He is the son of Bob Keefer, an arts writer and photographer, and Lisa Strycker, a data analyst and former journalist.http://oregonprogress.oregonstate.edu/fall-2007/profile From 2005 to 2010, he wrote a column titled \\"Birdboy\\" for WildBird magazine. He has been Associate Editor of Birding magazine, the flagship publication of the American Birding Association, since 2006. He graduated magna cum laude in 2008 from Oregon State University with a degree in fisheries and wildlife and a minor in art. Since then, he has studied and observed birds around the world. In 2011, he solo hiked the entire 2,650-mile Pacific Crest Trail from Mexico to Canada. Research In 2019, Strycker joined the Lynch Lab for Quantitative Ecology at Stony Brook University in New York. His master's research focuses on population abundance and distribution of Ad√©lie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap Penguins, to better understand the dynamics of ecological change on the Antarctic Peninsula. The Lynch Lab is leading the analysis of data coming from the long-term Antarctic Site Inventory (ASI) biological monitoring program‚Äîthe only research program doing regular vessel-based biological census work on the Antarctic Peninsula. Books In 2011, Strycker's first book, \\"Among Penguins: A Bird Man in Antarctica,\\" was published by Oregon State University Press. It is a first-person account of a 10-week field job he worked in a remote field camp at Cape Crozier in Antarctica.http://www.oregonlive.com/environment/index.ssf/2009/01/addicted_to_birds_oregon_state.html His second book, \\"The Thing With Feathers: The Surprising Lives of Birds and What they Reveal about Being Human,\\" was published in 2014 by Riverhead Books. It explores the behaviors of different bird species, with connections to human behavior. Strycker's third book, \\"Birding Without Borders: An Obsession, a Quest and the Biggest Year in the World\\" is about his Big Year journey in 2015. It came out in October 2017 from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. \\"Birds of the Photo Ark,\\" a collaboration with photographer Joel Sartore, came out in March 2018 from National Geographic. It features essays by Strycker about birds photographed in captivity by Sartore as part of his Photo Ark project. In 2019 the \\"Backyard Guide to the Birds of North America\\" came out from National Geographic. Co-authored by Strycker and by Jonathan Alderfer, it's a completely revised second edition of a field guide to 150 of the most common and interesting birds in North America. The Big Year Strycker began his worldwide Big Year on January 1, 2015, in Antarctica, aboard the Akademik Ioffe, a former Soviet research vessel then leased by One Ocean Expeditions for adventure tourism. The first bird he saw of the year was a Cape petrel, near Spert Island. From there he traveled up the South and North American continents, across to Europe, throughout Africa, and into Asia and Australia. The trip took him to 42 countries and all seven continents, and was done entirely with a backpack. On September 16, 2015, near Thattekad, India, he saw a pair of Sri Lanka frogmouths, his 4,342nd bird species of the year, which topped the previous world Big Year record set in 2008 by British birders Alan Davies and Ruth Miller. His final species of the year was a group of Silver- breasted broadbills seen on a return to India, in Assam, putting him at the record breaking total of 6,042 species. This record was later broken in 2016 by Arjan Dwarshuis. Strycker wrote a book about the adventure for Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.https://www.audubon.org/features/birding-without-borders ReferencesExternal links * Official website * Strycker on Audubon.org * Lynch Lab at Stony Brook University Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:Writers from Eugene, Oregon Category:Oregon State University alumni Category:American ornithological writers Category:People from Creswell, Oregon ","title":"Noah Strycker"},{"id":"49230152","text":"David Boutin is a former member of the New Hampshire Senate.

Life and work  Godlewski was the son of a builder. Unbeknownst to his father he learned in high school the arts of horse-riding, trapeze arts and acrobatics. After the death of his father Godlewski decided to adopt a circus commitment in order to receive a monthly salary of 50 rubles. After years of traveling with a traveling circus, he was supported by Ernst Renz (1815-1892) to commit to Berlin, where he trained as a clown and teeterboard springer. He worked with elephants and companies of soldiers with fixed bayonets, he later became well known and won world prizes.. Godlewski has already established himself as a celebrity when Wilhelm Jahn (1835-1900) brought him in 1893 from Berlin to the Vienna Court Opera. In his first year of his commitment he was one of the busiest members of the Corps. Because of his reputation, he was appointed at the turn of the century as a dancing master to the court. He was dancing with Grete Wiesenthal, he was the first mime and solo dancer of the Vienna Hofopernballetts from 1918‚Äì19, just before the archducal lost its influence over the stage. In the spring of 1918, Godlewski looked back to 1770 performances on his 25 years anniversary. Godlewski choreographed numerous ballets at the Vienna Opera, among others, including the world premiere of Erich Wolfgang Korngold‚Äôs first work, the pantomime The Snowman (1910). He also designed large revues for the general public, such as the trip Around the world in 80 days (1905) in Vienna's Olympic Arena, which was over 4000 moorings and one of the largest theatres in Europe. Godlewski's career demonstrates the cultural policy with its educational hostility and sympathy for popular culture, and the declared tolerance during anti-Semitic currents in pre-First World War Vienna, at the time of the Viennese mayor Karl Lueger. Carl Godlewski married dancer Maria Ludmilla Klahs (1868-1934), with whom he celebrated their silver wedding anniversary in 1914 on his country estate in Tulln an der Donau..

Early life  Matthews was born in 1936. He hails from Kerala (Eraviperoor), Kumbanad, India and was popularly known as Toyota Sunny, owing to his work in Kuwait with the Toyota agency owned by the Al-Sayer Group.

Bathing pool to the east, fishing pool to the north. The asylum named St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics is to the south. The Perilous Pond, sometimes spelt Perelous, was an ancient pond fed by a spring in London located near the junction of modern-day Old Street and City Road. It gained its name from many tragic drownings there of people using it as a swimming hole. It was also used by fishermen and wildfowlers . In 1743 the pond was purchased by William Kemp, a jeweller, who developed it by enclosing it in stone edging and adding marble steps and a gravel bottom. He built a separate pond for fishing and renamed the site the more enticing Peerless Pool. The grounds were screened by trees and the pool was used as an ice rink in winter. Kemp imposed an annual admission charge of ¬£1 10s. (or 1s. for day visitors). The pool was 170 ft long x 108 ft wide and from 3‚Äì5 feet deep. It was London's first outdoor public swimming pool. From 1790 there was also a small library and a bowling green attached.Perilous Pond Brewers Dictionary Of Phrase and Fable, Edited by Russ Willey, Chambers Harrap Publishers (2009) DOI:10.1093/acref/9780199916214.001.0001 Around 1805, the lease was acquired by Joseph Watts, who drained the fish pond and constructed Baldwin Street on that part of the site. The business provided the family with a comfortable living. Richard Garnett mentions that his colleague Thomas Watts (1811-1869), \\"keeper of printed books at the British Museum\\" (i.e. what would now be a senior position at the British Library), had his education paid for by the profits from the family business. William Hone , the satirist, visited the pool in 1826 and described it thus:- > ‚ÄúTrees enough remain to shade the visitor from the heat of the sun on the > brink. On a summer evening it is amusing to survey the conduct of the > bathers; some boldly dive, others timorous stand and then descend step by > step, unwilling and slow; choice swimmers attract attention by divings and > somersets, and the whole sheet of water sometimes rings with merriment. > Every fine Thursday and Saturday afternoon in the summer columns of Bluecoat > boys, more than a score in each, headed by their respective beadles, arrive > and some half strip themselves ‚Äòere they reach their destination.

The game, as stated by the studio, is a mix of Burnout, Black, and NBA Jam, in which players attempt to cause the most destruction by playing miniature golf within a confined space, such as a china shop or a kitchen. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in June 2016. Gameplay Dangerous Golf features around one hundred different miniature golf holes situated in spaces with many destructible objects, including a china shop, a kitchen, a bathroom, a gas station, and a palace. Players take turns to try to hit their ball into the hole, but points (in the form of monetary value) are awarded for making trick shots, and for destroying as many of the objects in the room as possible. Further, players have the opportunity to turn their golf ball into a \\"SmashBreaker\\", a miniature bomb to cause even more damage, if they destroy enough objects with their shot. Other obstacles include courses that include multiple rooms, the use of teleporters, and special objectives that score more points if the player meets them. Failure to sink the ball into the hole's cup in the fixed number of shots will deduct a large monetary value from the player's score. The game supports a party mode for up to eight players online, as well as local multiplayer. Development The founders of Three Fields are Fiona Sperry and Alex Ward, the founders and developers at Criterion Games who worked on both the Burnout and Need for Speed series. Sperry considered Burnout as one of the more enjoyable and popular games they had developed, particular its Crash modes and the mini-game Burnout Crash!, where the goal was to drive a car into an area and cause as much destruction as possible. When Criterion, after its purchased by Electronic Arts, moved away from the Burnout series and dedicated more staff towards Need for Speed, Sperry and Ward opted to leave the company in late 2013. After waiting out the termination of their contracts, they then formed Three Fields, along with another Criterion developer Paul Ross. More former Criterion staff would follow: as of May 2016, nine of the eleven developers at Three Fields are former Criterion developers. The name Three Fields is based on the notion that all the founding employees had skills within all three fields of their business, design, art and engineering. Three Fields was formed with the intent to create a spiritual successor to the Burnout series on their own. Though this was their long-term goal, they did not anticipate that a game like Dangerous Golf would be their first title as a new studio, but found later that this would be a useful step towards their larger goals. Three Fields wanted to make a game that was similar to an arcade game, that was fast and fun. The idea of a golf game came from the documentary The Short Game, about 7- and 8-year old golfers, and from videos from the \\"Dude Perfect\\" YouTube channel that featured seemingly-impossible basketball trick shots. The three recognized that a golf game centered around trick shots alongside the destruction they wanted from Burnout was an ideal concept. The concept was \\"stupid\\" and \\"ridiculous\\" for a golf game in the same manner that Burnout had been for racing games, being a light-hearted scoring challenge with much destruction. Similar arcade-style sports video games like NBA Jam served as some inspiration for Dangerous Golf in how to present a sports game that wasn't focused on the sports aspect. Prototyping for the game started with the palace concept with all the fine china that would be present, however they also took inspiration from the movie Clerks to come up with the idea of a gas station/convenience store as a setting. Ward noted they wanted to make a level taking place in a bakery shop, inspired by the Magnolia Bakery chain in New York, but believed they would have difficulty in simulating the destruction of foodstuffs for their first development effort, and see its potential as a future goal for the company. The amount of destruction they envisioned also helped them to recognize the capabilities of modern hardware to model and render detailed destruction, physics, and liquid interactions, the central element that would be needed in a Burnout successor. While a mobile game would have potentially given them the same lessons while also being an easier target for their small team, they felt they needed to be on the computer and console platforms, enabled by the capabilities of new Application programming interfaces provided by Epic Games and Nvidia. The team had originally started development using the Unity engine, but about ten months in switched to Epic's Unreal 4 engine which had more powerful capabilities for the game. Though none of the developers had worked with that engine before, they had technical help from developers at Epic's Guildford office. Additional middleware includes Nvidia's PhysX and APEX systems, and they further reviewed SIGGRAPH papers to find methods to better simulate and render the destruction caused by the player in a realistic manner. Development of Dangerous Golf has been wholly supported by personal funds from the company's founders, and they have not sought any publisher to aid in finances. According to Three Fields, if the game is successful enough for the company, they will begin working on their next project: a racing game. The developers announced that they had started work on this next project in July 2016. Dangerous Golf was originally set to be released in May 2016, but subsequently delayed; the game was released on 3 June 2016 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. On release, the game had received criticism for some lacking features, such as a lack of keyboard and mouse controls. Three Fields has patched the game to addressed and add new features; a patch in July 2016 included adding an introductory tutorial video voiced by Ted Stryker, who had done similar narration for Burnout 3.  Reception  Dangerous Golf received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.

Sometimes it is closely associated with lower back pain. Causes Causes of pain around the hip joint may be intra-articular, extra-articular, or referred pain from neighboring structures, such as sacroiliac joint, spine, symphysis pubis, or the inguinal canal. Common etiologies include: *Trochanteric bursitis, caused by inflammation of the trochanteric bursa of the outer hip, often affecting both hips *Arthritis of the hip, degeneration of the hip joint from osteonecrosis, trauma, sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, or anatomic anomalies * Meralgia paresthetica, a chronic neurological disorder of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, most common among those who are pregnant or have diabetes * Hip avascular necrosis, cell death of bone tissue in the hip joint brought on by vascular occlusion or coagulation which is the result of old age, alcoholism, trauma, decompression sickness, or several other possible causes; the treatment is often total hip replacement * Occult hip fracture, a fine crack somewhere in the hip socket, common in elderly women and those with osteoporosis, usually only in one hip * Snapping hip, a condition caused by iliotibial band snap, iliopsoas tendon snap, and hip labral tear, usually only in one hip; may be accompanied by an audible \\"snap\\" when the hip joint is moved * Paget's disease, enlarged or deformed bones of the hip, a genetic disorder; pain is usually in both hips simultaneously * Malignancy, as cancer in the pelvis or proximal femur may cause pain; usually only one hip is affected * Primary septic arthritis caused by an infection within the synovial fluid of the hip, a condition rare in adults except for those who are already immunocompromised as well as those who have artificial hips; only one side of the pelvis is affected, onset of pain is rapid * Transient or accute synovitis or \\"irritable hip\\", a condition most common in children, more often in boys than girls, and clearing up on its own within 7‚Äì10 days; pain is only on one side * Sciatica, a condition most often brought on by damage to the L4 or L5 nerve roots but sometimes caused by inflammation or tension in the piriformis muscle of the pelvis (which rests on the sciatic nerve), in which case the condition is called piriformis syndrome; pain usually only occurs in one side but may occur in the other side at other times or (rarely) both sides simultaneously * Sacroiliac joint dysfunction, an uncommon neurological condition of the mostly-immobile sacroiliac joint of the hip brought on by previous trauma to the joint such as an automobile accident; pain will usually be in only one side * Radiculopathy, a nerve disorder brought on by pressure or irritation of a nerve at its root (i.e., near the spine) often resulting from degeneration of a spinal disc, joint degeneration, or osteoarthritis, among other causes Pain in the groin, called anterior hip pain, is most often the result of osteoarthritis, osteonecrosis, occult fracture, acute synovitis, and septic arthritis; pain on the sides of the hip, called lateral hip pain, is usually caused by bursitis; pain in the buttock, called posterior or gluteal hip pain, which is the least common type of hip pain, is most often caused by sacroiliac joint dysfunction as well as sciatica (whether from a hemorrhaged spinal disk or a tense piriformis muscle). Herpes zoster (shingles) may also cause posterior hip pain. Clinical examination Clinical tests are adapted to identify the source of pain as intra-articular or extra-articular. The flexion-abduction-external rotation (FABER), internal range of motion with overpressure (IROP), and scour tests show sensitivity values in identifying individuals with intra-articular pathology ranging from 0.62 to 0.91. Medical imaging Projectional radiography (\\"X-ray\\") is the first imaging technique of choice in hip pain, not only in older people with suspected osteoarthritis but also in young people without any such suspicion. In this case plain radiography allows categorization as normal hip or dysplastic hip, or with impingement signs, pincer, cam, or a combination of both.Initially largely copied from: Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license =Need for clinical correlation= Imaging of the hip needs to be complementary to the clinical history and physical examination because it is well known that imaging findings do not always correlate with the presence of pain and vice versa. =X-Ray= Projectional radiography (\\"X-ray\\") is currently useful not only in older people in whom osteoarthritis of the hip is suspected but also in younger people without osteoarthritis, who are being evaluated for femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) or hip dysplasia. Plain radiography allows us to categorize the hip as normal or dysplastic or with impingement signs (pincer, cam, or a combination of both). Besides these, pathologic processes like osteoarthritis, inflammatory diseases, infection, or tumors can also be identified (Figure 1). Figure 1.

The most useful lines and angles that can be drawn in the pediatric pelvis assessing DDH are as follows: File:X-ray of measurements on a normal hip.jpgFigure 2A. Normal hip. File:X-ray of measurements in hip dysplasia.jpgFigure 2B. Hip dysplasia. ;Joint effusion File:X-ray of left hip effusion secondary to trauma.jpgFigure 2C. AP view of a patient with left hip effusion secondary to trauma showing widening of the medial joint space. ;Legg-Calv√©-Perthes disease (LCPD) Most cases of Legg-Calv√©-Perthes disease (LCPD) develop between the ages of 4 and 10 years (Figure 3). Classification of its severity can be assessed by radiographs. Herring or lateral pillar classifications and the patient‚Äôs age strongly correlate with the outcome. File:Herring lateral pillar classification.jpgFigure 3A. Herring lateral pillar classification Figure 3B. AP radiograph (e), coronal T1 (f), and PD fat sat (g) weighted images showing loss of fat signal of the epiphysis, edema, and cyst formation in femoral metaphysis in a grade C Perthes disease. In Group A, which has a better prognosis, there are no loss of height in the lateral third of the femoral head and little density changes; in Group B, there is lucency and lateral height loss of less than 50%; and in Group C, the most severe form, there is more than 50% loss of lateral height. Group B/C is considered when the loss of lateral pillar height is at 50%. People who are over the age of 8 years at the time of onset and have a hip in the lateral pillar B group or B/C border group have a better outcome with surgical treatment than they do with conservative treatment. Group B hips in children who are less than 8 years at the time of onset have a very favorable outcome unrelated to the treatment, whereas Group C hips in children of all ages usually have poor outcome unrelated to the treatment. ;Slipped capital femoral epiphyses (SCFE) Slipped capital femoral epiphyses (SCFE) usually affect 11- to 14-year-old adolescents (Figure 4). Radiographs may show widening and irregularity of the physis and posterior inferior displacement of the capital femoral epiphysis. On the AP view Klein‚Äôs line, tangent to the lateral aspect of the femoral neck, does not intersect the femoral head indicating that it is displaced. SCFE may compromise the blood supply to the femoral head and cause avascular necrosis, mainly when there is instability between the fragments.

It was considered normal at emergency despite the widening of the left physis (arrow). Two weeks later epiphysiolysis was evident (b). Despite appropriate surgical reduction (c) osteonecrosis developed and femoral head collapsed 1 month later (d). X-ray in adults X-ray of the hips of a 40-year-old female, with dysplasia of her right hip. ;Hip dysplasia Measurements of hip dysplasia in adults are quite different from those in children. ;Osteoarthritis In adults, one of the main indications for radiographs is the detection of osteoarthritic changes (Figure 1(e)). Nevertheless, radiographs usually detect advanced osteoarthritis that can be graded according to the T√∂nnis classifications. The grading system ranges from 0 to 3, where 0 shows no sign of osteoarthritis. Intermediate grade 1 shows mild sclerosis of the head and acetabulum, slight joint space narrowing, and marginal osteophyte lipping. Grade 2 presents with small cysts in the femoral head or acetabulum, moderate joint space narrowing, and moderate loss of sphericity of the femoral head. Grade 3 is the severest form of osteoarthritis, which manifests as severe narrowing of the joint space, large subchondral cyst with productive bone changes that may lead to deformity of the bone components of the joint, while secondary osteoarthritis due to calcium pyrophosphate deposition can be diagnosed when calcification of hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage is detected. There are other pathological conditions that can affect the hip joint and radiographs help to make the appropriate diagnosis. Acute bacterial septic arthritis can be diagnosed by radiographs when a fast regional osteoporosis and destructive monoarticular process develops (Figure 1(f)). In case of tuberculous or brucella arthritis it is manifested as a slow progressive process, and diagnosis may be delayed. Synovial chondromatosis can be confidently diagnosed by X-ray when calcified cartilaginous chondromas are seen. However, other synovial proliferative processes, such as pigmented villonodular synovitis, require MRI for accurate diagnosis, although noncalcified synovitis can be suspected in radiographs by indirect signs, such as soft tissue swelling and/or erosions in the femoral head, femoral neck, or acetabulum (Figure 7). Figure 7: File:CT of pigmented villonodular synovitis.jpgAxial CT image of pigmented villonodular synovitis eroding the posterior cortex of the femoral neck.

Radiological signs of transient osteoporosis of the hip include localized osteoporosis of the femoral head and neck (Figure 8). Nevertheless, final diagnosis has to be made with MRI to differentiate it from avascular necrosis and from insufficiency or stress fractures of the femoral head or neck. In case of AVN, radiographs can only demonstrate delayed or advanced signs. Staging according to Ficat classification ranges between normal appearance (stage I), slight increased density in the femoral head (stage II), subchondral collapse of the femoral head with or without ‚Äúcrescent‚Äù sign (stage III), and advanced collapse with secondary osteoarthritis (stage IV). In the case of stress or insufficiency fractures X-ray sensitivity has been proven to be much lower than MRI, which is currently the gold standard.

File:T1 MRI of avascular necrosis of the femoral head.jpgCoronal T1 of a patient with avascular necrosis of the femoral head. =Magnetic resonance imaging= Many pathological conditions of the hip are detected early by MRI due to its high soft tissue resolution and sensitivity. Its accuracy in studying acute hip pain in children has proved to be superior to ultrasound and plan film radiography. However, MRI accessibility and the need of sedation relegate its use to selected cases in which diagnosis is not clear with less demanding techniques. These include differentiating transient synovitis from a septic arthritis or osteomyelitis, diagnosis of inflammatory joint disease or bone tumors, and early detection and follow-up of Perthes disease. MRI findings correlate with prognosis in LCPD. These include extent and distribution of epiphyseal necrosis, subchondral ossified nucleus fracture, involvement of the lateral pillar, and disturbance of physeal growth, including presence of transphyseal neovascularity or bridging. Recent studies have been focused on the role of diffusion weighted MRI because it does not need contrast medium administration. ADC ratio of the femoral metaphysis was positively correlated with the Herring classification. ADC ratio superior to 1.63 indicates bad prognosis with 89% sensitivity and 58% specificity. In adults, MRI is currently playing a definite role in the assessment of osteoarthritis. Although traditionally belonging to the arena of radiographs, the role of MRI has been stressed after the term femoral acetabular impingement was coined in 2003. Growing interest has been focused in accurate diagnosis of the acetabular and femoral morphological abnormalities that may lead to early osteoarthritis. MR imaging is considered paramount to these objectives, mainly when surgery is considered, due to the ability of MRI to portray the whole section of the femoral neck surface, as well as to image the labrum and articular cartilage. Diagnosis of impingement can only be achieved if, besides imaging findings, there are also clinical symptoms and positive impingement maneuvers. Most of the angles and measurements described in the plain radiograph section can be accurately reproduced on MRI. In addition, the superiority of MRI resolution with intra- articular contrast allows detection of labral and chondral abnormalities that may influence the choice of medical, percutaneous, or surgical management (Figure 9). Figure 9: File:Sagittal T1 MRI of labral tear.jpgSagittal T1 weighted image showing anterosuperior labral tear. File:Sagittal T1 MRI of chondral lesion.jpgSagittal T1 weighted image showing chondral lesion. File:Sagittal CT-arthrography of chondral injury.jpgSagittal CT-arthrography showing posteroinferior chondral injury. File:Coronal CT-arthrography of ligamentum teres tear.jpgCoronal CT-arthrography (d) showing ligamentum teres tear. MR arthrography has proven superior in accuracy when compared to native MR imaging. It is considered the best technique to assess the labrum. Knowledge of the normal variable morphology of the labrum helps to differentiate tears from normal variants. A triangular shape is most commonly seen in 66% of asymptomatic volunteers, but round, flattened, and absent labra can also be found in asymptomatic populations. MR arthrography has demonstrated sensitivity over 90% and specificity close to 100% in detecting labral tears. Loose bodies are demonstrated as filling defects surrounded by the hyperintense gadolinium. Association between labral tears and chondral damage has been demonstrated. This underscores the interaction between cartilage and labrum damage in the progression of osteoarthritis. Chondral damage to the posteroinferior part of the acetabulum as a contrecoup lesion occurs in approximately one-third of pincer cases secondary to persistent abutment on the anterior part of the joint leading to a slight posteroinferior subluxation. This is considered a bad prognosis sign. MR arthrography can also demonstrate ligamentum teres rupture or capsular laxity, which are debated causes of microinstability of the hip. Elongation of the capsule or injury to the iliofemoral ligament or labrum may be secondary to microtrauma in athletes. MR can demonstrate abnormalities in these cases, such as increased joint volume or a ligamentum teres tear (Figure 9). Intra-articular osseous causes of pain include several conditions: avascular necrosis (AVN), transient osteoporosis of the hip (TOH), tumors, and stress or insufficiency fractures. All these entities may present with a pattern of bone marrow edema characterized by decreased signal intensity on T1 weighted images and increased signal intensity on fluid sensitive sequences, such as fat saturated T2-weighted or STIR images. When there is no evidence of a focal lesion associated with the edema pattern, TOH is suspected. When a band of low intensity is seen inside the edematous area, the shape and length of this band become important. It is generally convex to the articular surface in the case of subchondral stress or insufficiency fractures, whereas it is concave, circumscribing all of the necrotic segment, in cases of AVN. When doubts do persist, gadolinium-enhanced MRI tends to show that the proximal portion beyond the band is enhanced in fractures but is not in AVN. MRI has been shown to have 100% sensitivity and specificity in prospective studies of occult hip fractures. These fractures were diagnosed by bone marrow edema and a low signal fracture line, mainly on T1 or T2 weighted images (Figure 10). Figure 10: File:X-ray of stress fracture of the hip.jpgStress femoral neck fracture in a young athlete barely visible in X-ray film as a sclerotic line (arrow) File:Tc 99 scintigraphy of a stress fracture.jpgIn this case, Tc 99 scintigraphy shows a band of uptake File:T1 and DP fat sat MRI of a stress fracture.jpgFurthermore, T1 (left) and DP fat saturated (right) weighted MR images showed the fracture line and a pattern of edema. In synovial proliferative disorders, MRI demonstrates synovial hypertrophy. In the case of PVNS, characteristic foci of low signal intensity related to hemosiderin deposition are better seen on gradient echo T2* images (Figure 7). In the case of synovial osteochondromatosis, the synovial hypertrophy is accompanied by intermediate signal cartilaginous loose bodies and/or low signal calcified loose bodies. =Computed Tomography= Due to radiation concerns, CT has been relegated after MRI in the study of intra-articular causes of hip pain. The only exception where CT is considered superior to MRI is in bone tumors, because of its ability in characterizing matrix calcifications, and in depicting the anatomy of acute traumatic fractures. Typical matrix calcifications include the following: (a) osteoid mineralization, like a dense cloud, (b) chondroid calcification, reproducing a punctate popcorn pattern, or (c) fibrous calcification, ground glass-like appearance. There are also tumors that typically do not show matrix calcification. CT is also used for accurate localization of the nidus in osteoid osteomas and this must be differentiated from Brodie‚Äôs abscess or a stress fracture. The current standard treatment of osteoid osteoma is percutaneous radiofrequency ablation and this is usually performed under CT guidance. Quite often, CT is widely available unlike MRI, especially in the acute setting. CT is performed in this setting when doubt about the existence of a fracture persists following plain radiograph. Modern multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) shows results comparable with MRI for detecting occult fractures. Due to the submillimeter resolution of MDCT arthrography, many authors consider this technique complementary to MR arthrography. It may even have superior sensitivity in detecting cartilage pathology, but lesser detecting labral tears. CT can also be used to obtain accurate measurement of the femoral version and torsion. The femoral version is measured by an angle formed between a line through the femoral head-neck axis and another horizontal line drawn between both ischial tuberosities. Normal values range between 5 and 25¬∞. Retroversion is considered abnormal. Femoral torsion is the angle between a line along the femoral head and neck axis and a second line that is touching the posterior border of both femoral condyles. The normal value at birth is approximately 32¬∞ and decreases gradually with age. In adults, the normal value ranges from 10¬∞ to 20¬∞. =Ultrasound= Ultrasound is the first-choice technique for diagnosis of newborns hip dysplasia. In experienced hands with appropriate technology, ultrasound can also be useful during the first year of life. Some European healthcare systems encourage universal ultrasound screening in neonates between the sixth and eighth weeks. Although it shows higher initial costs caused, it leads to significant reduction in the total number and overall costs of dysplastic hips undergoing operative and nonoperative treatment. Ultrasound allows categorizing pediatric hips, according to Graf‚Äôs criteria, in four main types: normal, immature, and dysplastic (subluxed and dislocated). This classification is based on measurements of the acetabular inclination angle (alpha), cartilage roof angle (beta), and infant age. The femoral head coverage can also be determined by dividing the length of the femoral head covered by the acetabular fossa and the diameter of the femoral head. Its lower normal limits are 47% for boys and 44% for girls (Figure 11). Figure 11: File:Alpha and beta angles on neonatal hip ultrasonography.jpgUseful ultrasound measures in neonatal hip sonography, alpha and beta angles. File:Femoral head coverage on neonatal hip ultrasonography.jpgMeasurement of femoral head coverage. In a recent study, including newborns with high clinical suspicion for DDH (Ortolani/Barlow test, asymmetry in abduction of 20¬∞ or greater, breech presentation, leg-length discrepancy, and first-degree relative treated for DDH), hip sonography led to a change in clinical diagnosis in 52% of hips and to a change in management plan in 32% of hips. It obviated further follow-up in 23%, strengthening its role as an important technique reassuring the clinical diagnosis. During childhood, ultrasound is a quick method to assess hip pain and quite often may be used to avoid use of irradiating techniques, such as radiography or CT. Ultrasound allows evaluation of joint effusion, synovial thickening and neovascularity, the bone/cartilage contour, and the femoral head-neck alignment. Although sonography is extremely sensitive in detecting increased synovial fluid, it is nonspecific and cannot be used with accuracy to determine the type of fluid. Transient synovitis of the hip, despite being the most frequent cause of pain in children between 3 and 10 years, remains a diagnosis of exclusion. It usually shows anechoic fluid, but echogenic fluid can also be found. The effusion is considered pathologic when it is measured at >2 mm in thickness. The differential diagnosis is wide, including osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, primary or metastatic lesions, LCPD, and SCFE. Discrimination from septic arthritis is challenging, often requiring joint aspiration. In septic arthritis, US is able to demonstrate a hip joint effusion, synovial thickening, and cartilage damage, although the appearances are nonspecific. A step between the head and the physis can be detected in children with SCFE, while abnormalities in the femoral head contour may suggest the presence of LCPD. In both cases, radiographs are mandatory to confirm diagnosis and severity (Figure 12).

In adults, the most common application for US is to detect tendon or muscle injuries, effusion or synovitis within the hip joint or its adjacent bursae. Joint effusions may be due to many intra-articular processes and this may need another imaging technique to achieve a specific diagnosis. =Nuclear Medicine= Bone scanning in people with hip pain can be complementary to other imaging studies, mainly in indeterminate bone lesions to clarify whether it is an active lesion with abnormal radiotracer accumulation. Nevertheless, MRI has replaced scintigraphy in the diagnosis of most of these conditions. An example is stress or insufficiency fractures: increased uptake is usually present in around 80% of fractures within 24 h, and 95% of fractures reveal activity by 72 h following trauma, showing an overall sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 95%. MRI is superior to bone scans in terms of sensitivity (99%-100%) and specificity (100%). Moreover, a bone scan does not provide detailed anatomical location of the fracture, and further imaging is usually required.

According to Diego Quiroga, Argentina's agriculture agency‚Äôs chief of vegetative protection, said that it is impossible to eradicate the swarm, so they are focusing on minimizing the damage caused by it by sending out fumigators equipped with backpack sprayers to exterminate small pockets of young locusts that are still unable to fly. This method of extermination, however, is unable to wipe out pocket of locusts hidden in Argentina's large, dry forests. The swarm covers an area the size of 5,000 sq. km in Northern Argentina. The locusts are expected to grow ten inches and mature into flying swarms by February fifth. The locusts first appeared in small areas in June 2015. The mild Winter aided their population growth, allowing it to reach its current size. This swarm is reported to be the largest within 60 years despite last year's swarm being reported four miles in length and two miles in height. A swarm of this size is worrisome to Argentinians because locusts, a relative of grasshoppers, attack farmers' crops and can cause famine and starvation. This behavior is more pronounced when the locust population density is higher due to a trait called locust phase polyphenism, so it stands to reason that a larger swarm will be more aggressive than a smaller one. Currently, there are over one hundred outbreaks of locusts that have affected over an area of 700,000 hectares (roughly 2700 square miles). The infestation is so bad that SENASA, the government agricultural inspection agency, has set up a hotline for people to call if they see any locusts.

Carson (13 April 1842 ‚Äì 31 October 1909), known as Colonel Carson, was a prominent African-American political leader in Washington, D.C. in the late 19th century. He was called the \\"silver haired giant,\\" and his reputation was to have rattled the whites and elite blacks of Washington. Known as the voice of the working black Washingtonians, Perry spoke out for his people, acted upon his beliefs, and represented low-income black residents at multiple Republican National Conventions.  Background In 1842, Perry H. Carson was born free in Princess Anne County, Maryland. As a teenager in Baltimore, Maryland, Carson assisted abolitionists as they aided fleeing slaves. He was arrested, but later released. Beginning in 1864, Carson supported the Union war effort by doing odd jobs for the army, and ultimately became a volunteer. After the Civil War, Carson moved to Washington and quickly became a leader in the District's African-American community. He worked as a bodyguard for Mayor Sayles Bowen and a trusted messenger to Alexander Shepherd, exposing him to important Washington area politicians. Carson drew the majority of his support from working-class black community. Carson gathered considerable political capital, as evidenced by his presidency of the District's Blaine Invincible Republican Club and extended tenure as the District's representative to the Republican National Convention. Carson was known as one of the foremost political 'boss[es]' of black Washington. Carson was particularly noticeable in the city for his unique physique. Standing over six feet tall, weighing around 235 pounds, and weighing his signature silver hair, Carson was known as the 'Tall Black Oak of the Potomac'.  Political life  With a desire to act and make a difference in the lives of the black Washingtonians, Carson organized the \\"Boys in Blue,\\" a regiment of local black men to defend the black residents from the nearby Irish men that saw the working class blacks as a threat to their own jobs and freedom. This regiment gave Perry Carson the name of \\"Colonel.\\" The local black regiment was once just an idea, however as the people heard of Carson's plan, they supported it and the plan was adopted. Calling on the local black people, Carson expressed his intention for 1,500 colored men filled with patriotism to come out and meet with the selection committee and Carson himself. Support for the black regiment was wide spread, even coming from Howard University with about fifty students willing to volunteer their time to the president in a fight for democracy. Carson kept D.C. \\"stirred up,\\" from uniting the local poor blacks to demand equality, to protesting the Jim Crow laws on his own. While Jim Crow laws on streetcars were initiated in Maryland, defining a \\"colored\\" section to black riders, no one in Washington thought this state law would affect them in the District region. While boarding a train in the District, the driver ordered Carson to the colored section, Carson argued that he was in DC and the Jim Crow laws don't apply. The streetcar operator countered, explaining that he didn't know, nor did he care, but the colored folks would have to use the Jim Crow car. Not wanting to argue on he headed to his race specified section. Although he did not make a fuss over the Jim Crow laws in that instance, he was well known as the \\"shrewd, big-lunged boss at Washington,\\" as he rattled politicians in his fight for a delegation spot at the Republican National Conventions. Along with the local black regiment, Colonel Carson created the Blaine Invincible Club, which was focused on the interest of the race, the Republican Party, as it was the first Republican club in Washington, and helping those in need. Carson was named the president the Blaine Invincible Republican Club. Carson used his influence as one of the city's foremost Republicans to become the District's representative to the Republican National Convention. Carson served as the city's delegate from 1880‚Äì1900. In one of the times of selecting a delegate to go to the convention, a tribute to Perry Carson was submitted to the Washington Post. The writer proclaimed that no other delegate could hold the same amount of influence as Perry who had attended the conventions many times and was regarded as \\"the most influential of his race,\\" and \\"a leader in every effort for the benefit and advancement of his people.\\" Perry Carson was known to be \\"deeply interested in the prosperity of our city and can be depended upon to advance its interest in every way,\\" therefore gaining a supportive backing from the black working class. Emancipation Day Celebrations in Washington, DC thrived under Carson's leadership. Carson's legacy in the District is a bit obscured. Due in large part to the disfranchisement of the District, Carson was never able to hold elected office that matched his political influence. As a delegate to the Republican National Convention, he won praise and acclaim, but was not able to directly effect policy. Carson was an important advocate for the black community, representing the most needy and least skilled members of the black working class. Although he faced contemporary criticism for some of his tactics, Carson dedication to the less fortunate members of the black community was evident by the time of his death. Carson faced political opposition from blacks like Calvin Chase, who claimed Carson made the political condition more difficult for black by reinforcing existing stereotypes. Chase and Carson battle for political control of Washington's black community for three decades. Carson and Chase not only competed to represent the District at national conventions, they also conflicted over the proper way to celebrate Emancipation Day. The Emancipation Day celebration grew under Carson's supervision. At the age of 65, Carson faced political pressure to resign his post in the commissioner government of the District. The sitting commissioners hoped to remove a potential political opponent by pushing Carson to resign. In response to demands to take a pay cut, Carson retired from the political arena. Just a year and a half later, the Colonel caught pneumonia and died in his house in the District. When he died in 1909, even his enemies called him an \\"intrepid fighter.\\" References Category:1842 births Category:1909 deaths Category:19th-century African-American activists Category:Activists for African-American civil rights Category:Washington, D.C.

Around 1837, he entered the Academy of Fine Arts and studied with the history painter, Fyodor Bruni. In 1838, Bruni went to Rome to complete some work there and he followed in 1839, at his father's expense. In 1840, when Bruni returned to Russia, he stayed in Italy, using up his money and lapsing into drunkenness.

In 1846, at his father's request, he returned to Saint Petersburg and was awarded the title of \\"Artist\\" by the Academy for his painting of Angels proclaiming the punishment of Sodom and Gomorrah. He continued to paint primarily Biblical and historical scenes, although he also did landscapes. Some of his works were among the first bought by Pavel Tretyakov but, overall, they were not financially successful and, by the late 1850s, he was once again on the verge of poverty.

Education and Teaching Career  Neval Hollen Thomas was born in 1874 in Springfield, Ohio. He attended public school in Ohio, then pursued a bachelor's degree at Howard University.\\"Chris Myers Asch and G. Derek Musgrove, Chocolate City: Race and Democracy in the Nation‚Äôs Capital. (Chapel Hill. University of North Carolina Press, forthcoming).\\" Receiving his B.A. in 1901, he then enrolled in Howard Law School. Despite attaining his law degree in 1904 with hopes to go after a legal career, Thomas pursued teaching as a career instead. Thomas taught American history for 19 years at M Street High School in Washington, D.C. At the time, M Street High School (later named Dunbar High School) was one of the most \\"prestigious and exceptional African American educational institutions to have ever existed in the United States.\\" Students were offered a comprehensive academic education. Thomas was interested in the subjects of race and democracy and often tied his teachings at M Street High School to these subjects. In order to expand his education, he traveled abroad and visited churches and literary social clubs. He worked well with the school boards and accomplished several projects to get a stadium and a greenhouse built for the student and faculty body. Later, he became Dunbar's vice principal.  Washington Riots  The summer of 1919, also known as the Red Summer, brought great attention to Thomas. There was rioting on the streets of Washington between blacks and whites, and blacks armed themselves with guns to fight back. Thomas met with city officials, such as chief executive, Louis Brownlow, to discuss the events of the riots and encouraged something to be done immediately. As the fighting raged on in D.C., he helped obtain lawyers for imprisoned blacks, distributed pamphlets, and roamed the streets to help aid the rioters. Denouncing the city commissioner and chief of police, he claimed, ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt protect us, we will arm and defend ourselves.‚Äù Using his position working for the Washington Afro-American newspaper, Thomas reached out to the press. Even though Thomas pushed to end the riots, the congregation of blacks defending their rights on the streets impressed him.  Role with NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People)  Due to Thomas's leadership during the 1919 riots, as well as his ability to reason with an open ear, he earned a position on the board of directors of the NAACP branch in Washington in 1919. He channeled his activism within the NAACP toward the racial inequalities present in public schools within Washington. Thomas published an article in 1923 titled \\"District of Columbia-A Paradise of Paradoxes,\\" where he addressed the racial issues he saw present in the public schools. In his article, he focused on the inequalities of teachers salaries. During his time in the NAACP, he \\"pushed for equal pay for black school employees‚Äù as well as ‚Äúequal salaries for officers in white and black schools.\\" His lifelong commitment to the injustices of racial inequality within Washington D.C landed him a higher position on the NAACP Washington branch as president of the branch in 1925. Thomas was known as one of the most aggressive branch presidents. He continued to take action against racial inequalities as president. Starting in 1926, Thomas received mixed feedback from NAACP members, especially after he cancelled a speech for the women‚Äôs campaign. He wrote numerous hate-filled letters to board members, which were used as evidence for his increasingly radical ideals. Thomas protested in 1927 after \\"several Negro examiners in the Interior Department were assigned together in a new work station\\" and forced the Secretaty of the Interior Department to \\"rescind the segregation.\\" He used his rhetorical capabilities to convince his audiences. One author deemed him an ‚Äúegocentric spirit‚Äù who ‚Äúdeveloped a clique that was loyal to him personally, and he disparaged work done by others.‚Äù  Role Outside the NAACP  Thomas wrote an essay for The Messenger: a magazine produced by African- Americans that challenged racial segregation. He mentioned the lack of black policeman and firefighters in the city as well as unequal school funding between white and black schools. In 1928, he wrote an article for the Afro- American and said, ‚Äúthe real Republican Party was the greatest political agency in the history of our government, but, IT IS DEAD.‚Äù In the article, he denigrated the new era of the Republican Party by claiming they promote class differences between races as well as Ku Klux Klan ideals. Death and legacy Neval Thomas died on April 13, 1930 at age 56 due to ongiong health issues. Emma Merritt replaced him as head of the NAACP as the first woman president. After his death, the NAACP adopted less radical ideas; they were more content with the economical, social, and political disparities they faced than they used to be, and lacked his radical push for action. He was known for his active engagement in D.C. for the push for racial equality in public schools and in the workplace and would even ‚Äújeopardize his own bread and butter for a high principle.\\" However, by voicing his opinions and maintaining his outspoken, candid manor, he often developed hostility among his adversaries. In his honor, Washington, D.C. established the Neval Thomas Elementary School on Anacostia Avenue, Washington, D.C.

Traditional lands of various Australian Aboriginal tribes around Gladstone. Country According to Norman Tindale's classification, the Yuibera lands, starting from Mackay, were calculated to encompass roughly , ran from St. Helens south to Cape Palmerston and inland reached as far as the Connors Range. The Gia were to their north; the Biri in the area northwest of them; Wiri lay on their western flank, and beyond them the Barna. To their south were the Barada and, along the coast, the Koinjmal. The Yuibera were restricted to the coastal end of the Pioneer Valley, and were one of four peoples within of Mackay. History=Before European contact= In Mackay and its surrounding areas, six peoples have been identified: other than the Yuwibara, these were the Wiri, Biria, Jangga, Barna and Barada, with each group estimated to have consisted of 500 members. The Yuwibara people are said to have been the most dominant group in the area, occupying what is now Mackay City, the coast from St. Helens to Cape Palmerston and further inland to the Connor's Range. Boundaries were marked by natural features and punishment for incurring on other groups' territories was severe. What is now known as Cape Hillsborough was and remains of particular significance for the Yuwibara people. Firstly, it was a hunting and gathering ground for food, which is still apparent in archeological remains today. For instance, shellfish were collected from the mangroves, roasted over fires and the shells discarded in piles over the course of many years, forming middens, the oldest of which are up to 500 years old. Other remains include a stone fish trap, stone fireplaces, pieces of ochre from other areas as well as stone axe heads. Secondly, Cape Hillsborough is significant because boys were trained and initiated into manhood at the stone fish trap. Thirdly, the ground adjacent to Cape Hillsborough Resort is a burial ground, not only for the Yuwibara, but also for South Sea Islanders, and is thus sacred ground. Other locations of significance to the Yuwibara people include, for instance, the Kommo Toera Trail; a Melaleuca forest located in wetlands where food was gathered. Special ceremonies are also said to have been performed on the ocean-side of Mount Blackwood, which would later be a vantage point for spotting the Native Police. Stone fish traps can also be found at Slade Point, Reliance Creek, Ball Bay, Woodwark Bay, Adelaide Point, Hay Point, Llewellyn Bay as well as on West Hill Island, Green Island, Rabbit Island, Sth Repulse Island and other places. Trade with the Ngaro people in the nearby islands has also been documented. Billy Moogerah, who was the last Aboriginal person to live in the Whitsunday Islands, used to canoe from the islands to Cape Palmerston, making stops along the way for trade in Cape Hillsborough and Freshwater Point. However, Moogerah was removed from the islands when Bowen township was first settled. =European contact= The Mackay area began to be occupied by the British around 1860. They failed to recognise the tribal boundaries and hunting rights of the local groups. Faced with starvation, the local Yuwibara started hunting the settlers' livestock, which resulted in deadly conflict. It was estimated by contemporary local observers, George Bridgman and Father Bucas, that in the decade from 1850 to 1860 roughly 50% percent of the original Aboriginal population of the Pioneer Valley had been killed. The Native Mounted Police were considered the major cause, shooting down the local population in the ongoing frontier wars, but introduced diseases from which the Indigneous people had no immunity, also played a key role. The general trend in the Mackay area was described lightheartedly by the aristocratic Harold Finch-Hatton: > Alas for the greediness of the savage ! alas for the cruelty of his white > brother ! The rations contained about as much strychnine as anything else, > and not one of the mob escaped. When they awoke in the morning they were all > dead corpses. More than a hundred Blacks were stretched out by this ruse of > the owner of the Long Lagoon. In a dry season, when the water sinks low, > their skulls are occasionally to be found half buried in the mud. As a rule, > however, few people are ambitious of indulging in such wholesale slaughter, > and, when the Blacks are troublesome, it is generally considered sufficient > punishment to go out and shoot one or two. Writing in 1908, the early ethnographer Henry Ling Roth stated that: \\"in the Mackay district at any rate, the aborigines, if not all exterminated, have at least, through European influence, lost all knowledge of their old laws and customs\\". Language The Yuwi language, probably a dialect of Biri or one of its dialects, Wiri, if it was distinct at all, was recorded as having no speakers left, but since the 2010s work has been done to revive knowledge of the language from what remains in the early records. Culture The spiritual connection of the Yuwibara people with Cape Hillsborough continues to the present, and men's ceremonies are still performed along the mangrove boardwalk. Mount Jukes, too, was home to a men's ceremonial site, which is still visited each year by Yuwibara elders, who speak of a large spirit walking around the camping grounds. Food While Yuwibara women specialized in hunting freshwater turtles in the wetlands and swamps, the men would hunt sea turtles and dugong in the sea grass of the shore of Cape Hillsborough. The fat of dugong was even mixed with wax to form glue for spears. Moreover, fish, mud crabs, snakes, wallabies and brush turkeys formed an important part of their diet. Many different fruits were also eaten, including those from the Randia fitzalanii (native gardenia) and Mimusops elengi (Tanjong tree). Utilisation of other natural products * The bark of the Melaleuca viridiflora (broad-leafed tea tree) was used to build huts while the leaves were bruised in water which was then ingested for medicinal purposes. * The wood of the Acacia aulacocarpa (hickory wattle) was used to make digging sticks and spears while its seeds were used to make flour. * The Xanthorrhoea semiplana (grass tree) was used to make spear shafts and to start fires while its flowers were used to sweeten drinks. * The wood of the Corymbia dallachiana (ghost gum) burns well in wet conditions and was thus often used as firewood while its sap was used for medicinal purposes. * While the fruit of the Exocarpos latifolius (native cherry) was eaten, the wood and bark was burnt to repel mosquitoes. * The wood of the Flindersia schottiana (silver ash) was used to manufacture tools. * While the fruit of the Elaeocarpus grandis (blue quandong) was eaten, its seeds were also used for decoration and its buttress roots were used to make shields and paddles. * The bark of the Alstonia scholaris (milky pine) was ground to a powder which was then used as a glue to attach feathers to skin for ceremonies. * The fruit of the Morinda citrifolia (cheese fruit) was used for medicinal purposes while its roots were used for weaving or as string and its leaves were used to wrap up food for cooking. * The fruit of the Terminalia sericocarpa (damson) was eaten while other parts of the plant were used as fish poison. * While the fruit of the Ficus racemosa (cluster fig) was edible, the sap was used to relieve diarrhoea. * The stems of the Flagellaria indica (supple jack) were split and used for sewing and fibre while other parts were used for medicinal purposes. Burial customs The Yuwibara and other Mackay area tribes are said by early ethnographers to have called a man's spirit meeglo, and to have used the term to describe the first whites they encountered, believing them to be embodiments of their forefathers. An informant of Robert Brough Smyth and resident in Mackay, George Bridgman, noted with regard to area's tribal burial customs that: > he heard a funeral oration delivered over the grave of a man who had been a > great warrior which lasted more than an hour. The corpse was borne on the > shoulders of two men, who stood at the edge of the grave. During the > discourse he observed that the orator spoke to the deceased as if he were > still living and could hear his words.

After lying in the ground for three months or more, the body is > disinterred, the bones are cleaned, and packed in a roll of pliable bark, > the outside of which is painted and ornamented with strings of beads and the > like. This, which is called Ngobera, is kept in the camp with the living. If > a stranger who has known the deceased comes to the camp, the Ngobera is > brought out towards evening, and he and some of the near relations of the > dead person sit down by it, and wail and cut themselves for half an hour. > Then it is handed to the stranger, who takes it with him and sleeps by the > side of it, returning it in the morning to its proper custodian. Women and > children who die, Mr. Bridgman says, are usually burnt.

Plot  Jerry and Marty have just bought a brand new house, and what better way to celebrate than by throwing a New Year's party. However, as the evening progresses, some threatening secrets surface that might jeopardize the course of their marriage and the lives of their closest friends. This universally significant evening unexpectedly alters the lives of twelve intertwining friends and evokes a provocative inspection into marriage, friendship and the bewildering possibilities of love. See how a seemingly conventional celebration can easily spiral out of control, making Surviving New Years a resolution in and of itself.  Cast  Gerry Katzman as Jerry Dyan McBride as Marty Katie Rubin as Sophie Aaron Ramzi (credited as Ammar Ramzi) as Tony Heather Williams as Veronica Dennis O'Brien as Max Nino Mancuso as Vincent Emily Brideau as Denise Albert Friedman Fox as Bernie Glen Hardy as David Sally Norton as Judith Michael Perl as Reverend Mike  Production Notes  The story was written out in great detail, however the lines of each scene were completely improvised by the actors. There was a period of only 5 in which the entire cast would be available to film. In addition to keeping a small budget, the decision to film using digital video was made. Beatty felt this also added a sense of intimacy that would draw the audience into the action as if they were party guests watching and observing from the sidelines.  Soundtrack  Original music created by Daniel Westiner  Release  The film premiered at the 2008 SoCal Independent Film Festival in Huntington Beach, CA. Awards and nominations Surviving New Year's was an \\"official selection\\" and won Best Ensemble Cast at the 2008 SoCal Film Festival in Huntington Beach California.

Background Tharshan's family resettled in Sampur in 2015 and he had enrolled at Sampur Maha Vidyalayam in the first grade in January 2016. Eyewitnesses had seen Sri Lanka Navy personnel from a nearby sentry point grooming Tharshan with chocolates and other food. Incident On 25 January 2016 Tharshan had been playing with his brother and another boy. Later Tharshan's father Selvaratnam Kugathas had seen him playing in front of their home. He then disappeared. Tharshan's mother Kugathas Jeyavani went to find him but could not locate him. He was reported missing at around 5:30 p.m. Locals started searching for him and discovered his body in an abandoned well, approximately 30 metres from his house, near the \\"Vidura\\" navy camp. Locals initially thought that Tharshan had slipped and fell into the well. Coroner A. J. A. Noorullah arrived at the scene after a while and instructed a person to retrieve the body. When the body was recovered from the well at around midnight it was discovered that Tharshan's body had been tied to a stone weighing more than 3 kg using shoe laces before being thrown into the well. According to locals there were signs that Tharshan had been sexually abused before being murdered. Tharshan's body was sent to Trincomalee Hospital for a post-mortem.

He studied civil engineering at Queen's University at Kingston, graduating in 1914. He was Chief Engineer of the Ontario Highways Department, and Acting Deputy Minister from February 1927, when he was appointed as Deputy Minister on 1 January 1928. In 1934, following provincial elections, the new Ontario Highways Minister Thomas McQuesten discussed with Smith the new concept of \\"dual-lane divided highways,\\" based on the German autobahns, and decided that the highway known as the Middle Road would be converted into the new form of highway. Smith modified the design for Ontario roads. When it opened at the end of 1937, it was the first intercity divided highway in North America, preceding the Pennsylvania Turnpike, the first U.S. intercity divided highway, by one year. Smith was also a consultant and contractor on projects such as the Grand River Conservation Commission and the Alaska Highway, through his company R. Melville Smith Co. Ltd, and the Canada Culvert Co. Ltd, Toronto, of which he was president. In 1942, Smith was awarded the Julian C. Smith Medal b they Engineering Institute of Canada \\"for achievement in the development of Canada.\\" The citation read, \\"The successful development of the admirable highway system of Ontario during the past twenty years has been in no small measure due to the supervisory work of Robert Melville Smith, first as chief engineer and then deputy minister of highways, and since 1935 as deputy minister of the combined Departments of Highways and Northern Development. In these capacities his administration has been far-sighted and economical... he has gained a well-earned reputation as one of the leading Canadian authorities on highway problems. He has indeed 'rendered outstanding service in furthering the development of Canada'.\\" Smith resigned as Deputy Minister in 1943 because of ill health, and died at his home in Toronto on 16 November 1950.

Early life and education Randy W. Berry was born in 1965 and grew up on his family cattle ranch in Custer County, Colorado. Berry graduated from Bethany College in Lindsborg, Kansas, receiving a Rotary Scholarship to attend the University of Adelaide in Australia. Besides English, he speaks Spanish and Arabic. Career Berry worked for America West Airlines in Phoenix, Arizona, where he was employed as an international training manager. He joined the United States Foreign Service in 1993, serving as a diplomat in Nepal, Bangladesh, Egypt, South Africa, and Uganda.

Two months later, Berry was appointed to that office. Some analysts suggested Berry should have been appointed to the higher rank of ambassador. At the start of his term, Berry idenfitied his broad goal as \\"in essence, to strengthen partnerships with countries that are like-minded on the issue, try to make progress in countries that are seemingly on the fence about gay rights, and do what's feasible in countries where there's overt hostility.\\" In his first year as Special Envoy, Berry traveled to 42 countries in an effort to ensure that LGBTI persons everywhere are afforded equal rights under the law. He has also identified combatting violence and discrimination against LGBTI persons as a key priority for his tenure. He began his term as Special Envoy by focusing on supporting LGBTI rights in South America. He also argued that police resources in repressive homophobic societies like Uganda, infamous for its Kill the Gays bill, should be redirected towards combatting terrorism, not harassing their LGBTI citizens. Berry's 2015 meeting with Vatican officials from the Holy See's Secretary of State office garnered significant media attention given that the Catholic Church's holds the position that gay and lesbian sexual behavior a sin and restricts marriage to unions of one man and one woman. Berry addressed questions about his engagement at the Vatican by clarifying that \\"We were not there to talk about issues of civil unions or same-sex marriage, for example, because that is not part of our policy.\\" Instead, Berry said he hoped his meeting with Church officials would highlight \\"issues of violence and extreme discrimination are of concern to us all.\\" At the conclusion of his first year in office, on April 20, 2016, Berry briefed reporters at the State Department's daily press briefing to outline his priorities for the second year of his term. During that briefing, he said that one of his major priorities for the coming year would be to combat anti-LBGTI violence around the world and that the State Department \\"will work\\" with other branches of the U.S. Government, including the Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as \\"other agencies to leverage opportunities to reduce and prevent violence, share best practices and challenges and provide technical resources where we can.\\" The Obama administration, on January 20, 2017, also named Berry Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. On February 13, the State Department announced that Berry would continue in that position as well as that of Special Envoy in the Trump administration. Tony Perkins, head of the Family Research Council, called the appointment \\"a disappointing development\\" and said that \\"Keeping Berry only signals to the world that the extreme agenda of the Obama years is still deeply entrenched in the State Department\\". The conservative Family Research Council had made removing such \\"activists\\" a priority and as recently as December called on the State Department to rid itself of employees who promote an \\"anti-family, anti-life agenda.\\" A spokesperson for the Trump transition team responded to media outlets saying that any suggestion \\"that discrimination of any kind will be condoned or tolerated in a Trump administration is simply absurd.\\" Berry vacated the Special Envoy role in November 2017. As of July 2018, the role is currently vacant and no recruitment appears to have been taken place for a successor. Personal life Berry is married to Pravesh Singh, and together they have a son and a daughter. They reside in Washington, D.C..

Life He was the eldest son of Abraham Chatterton (died 1776), of Cork City, and his wife Martha Roche, daughter of Edmund Roche of Trabolgan. The Chatterton family had settled in Ireland during the reign of Elizabeth I. Thomas Chatterton, the founder of the Irish branch of the family, was granted an estate at Ardee in County Louth in 1573; the family later acquired lands in County Cork. Chatterton entered the Middle Temple in 1770 and was called to the Bar in 1774. He sat in the Irish House of Commons, first for Baltimore in 1781, and then for Doneraile from 1783 to 1797. He was created a baronet in 1801, presumably as a reward for supporting the Act of Union 1800. He was appointed Third Irish Serjeant in 1791 and Second Serjeant in 1793; he held the latter office until his death. He was also Keeper of the State Papers in Ireland: this office was apparently a sinecure. Family In 1790 Chatterton married Rebecca Lane (died 17 February 1838), daughter of Abraham Lane of Cork.

A graduate of the Juilliard School of Music Pre-College Division and the Curtis Institute of Music who made his Carnegie Hall debut at age 16, Bayard has performed percussion and timpani under numerous conductors. As a percussion soloist, he served with the Sacramento Symphony as the principal percussionist for 17 years and has been featured with the Philadelphia Orchestra, Boston Pops Orchestra, New Jersey Symphony, Queens Symphony, Joffrey Ballet Orchestra, Jacksonville Symphony, Reno Philharmonic, Stockton Symphony, and Santa Rosa Symphony. Bayard currently performs with Grammy award-winning Mary Youngblood.  Early life and education  Bayard playing timpani at age 14 Michael Bayard was born in Manhattan, New York, and attended public school in Flushing, Queens. His father Leo Bayard was a professional actor who studied at the Max Reinhardt Theatre and is known for his work in the touring company of the Broadway play Detective Story (1949), and with Lux Video Theatre and the Philco-Goodyear Television Playhouse. His mother Betty Bayard (stage name Elizabeth George) was an actress who later operated a drama and dance school with his father in Queens, New York. Bayard's parents encouraged his talents as a performer from a young age. At age 12, he began practicing diligently on a rubber drum pad in his basement in Flushing, Queens, developing both discipline and musical ability. During these basement years, Bayard was fascinated by dramatist and science fiction writer Rod Serling, inspired in part by Serling's development of his passion for the arts in his own family's basement. Bayard with John de Lancie (Director of the Curtis Institute of Music), 1979 At age 15, Bayard attended the Juilliard School of Music Pre-College Division on full scholarship, in the field of percussion and timpani.

In 1975, at age 17, Bayard appeared as a musician in the notable Coca-Cola commercial \\"Look Up America.\\" In 1976, Bayard attended the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia on full scholarship. At Curtis, Bayard performed percussion and timpani under conductors Riccardo Muti, Claudio Abbado, Leonard Slatkin, Paul Paray, Klaus Tennstedt, Yuri Temirkanov, and Dmitri Kitayenko. At Curtis in 1977, Bayard was artifact consultant on the Leopold Stokowski Musical Instrument and Orchestral Score Collection, which included a collection of exotic and unusual musical instruments acquired by Stokowski during his world travels. There, he gained an appreciation of ancient instruments that would inform his later career. During his Curtis years, Bayard performed on percussion with the Queens Symphony Orchestra and the New Jersey Symphony. He also performed as part of duo with percussionist Andrew Power on a Philadelphia Orchestra program in Mallet Mania. In his final year with the Curtis Symphony Orchestra, Bayard played principal timpani in a performance of Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, conducted by Rafael Fr√ºhbeck de Burgos at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia. This particular performance is arguably considered one of the most intense and ferocious performances of this work in the last century. During the summers from 1976 through 1985, Bayard played drum set in the show bands and lounge bands at several legendary Catskill Mountain resorts in upstate New York, namely Grossinger's, Kutsher's, and the Pines Hotel in the \\"Borscht Belt\\", and the Pine Springs Resort in Freehold, New York.

This performance engages a blend of percussion instruments from all over the world and hands-on student participation to inspire and motivate young people. This program provides a valuable lesson in how teamwork can bring about confidence, purpose, direction and the development of self-esteem. Bayard with \\"Dream Walker\\", 1997 Among the varied instruments used in Bayard's performances is the \\"Aerobell,\\" a metallic part from a satellite that he both strikes and plays with a contrabass bow. In 1996, Bayard expanded the Rhythm Magic concept into a teambuilding and communication training program for corporations, companies, government departments, and boards of directors across the United States.

He was one of the best two-year-olds of his generation in Britain in 1975 when he was unbeaten in three races including the Group One Observer Gold Cup. He began the following year as a leading contender for The Derby but was beaten in all three of his starts. He later stood as a breeding stallion but had little success as a sire of winners. Background Take Your Place was a tall, lightly-made bay horse with a small white star bred in Kentucky by John R. Gaines, Skara Glen Stable, & Dan Lasater. His sire, Round Table was one of the most successful grass specialists in American racing history, winning forty-three races and being named American Horse of the Year in 1958. He became a highly successful breeding stallion, being the Leading sire in North America in 1972. Take Your Place's dam Zonah won two minor races in the United States before becoming a successful broodmare: her other offspring included the leading racemare Drumtop. Zonah was a granddaughter of the influential broodmare Rough Shod, whose descendants have included Ridan, Moccasin, Apalachee, Thatch, Nureyev and Sadler's Wells. As a yearling Take Your Place was auctioned at Keeneland in July 1974 and was sold for $125,000. He passed into the ownership of Carlo d'Alessio and was sent to Europe where he was trained by Henry Cecil at Warren Place in Newmarket. Racing career=1975: two-year-old season= Take Your Place began his racing career by winning a maiden race over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse and then won a minor event over the same distance at Great Yarmouth. On 25 October he was moved up sharply in class for the Group One Observer Gold Cup, Britain's most valuable race for juveniles, over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse. Ridden by Gianfranco Dettori he started at odds of 4/1 in a field headed by the French challenger Earth Spirit (winner of the Crit√©rium de Maisons-Laffitte). Take Your Place overtook his pacemaker St Joles a furlong and a half from the finish but was immediately challenged by Earth Spirit. The pair engaged in what Timeform described as \\"a tremendous duel\\" before Take Your Place gained the advantage in the final strides and won by a head. The other French contender Gallapiat took third ahead of Indus Warrior. =1976: three-year-old season= In 1976, Take Your Place began his season in the Sandown Classic Trial over ten furlongs in April in which he started odds-on favourite but finished second to the Dick Hern-trained Riboboy. In the Dante Stakes (a major trial race for the Derby Stakes) at York Racecourse in May he was strongly fancied to enhance his claims for the Epsom classic but ran disappointingly to finish fourth behind Trasi's Son. He was then dropped in distance for the St James's Palace Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot in June and finished fifth of the eight runners behind Radetzky. Later that year he was sent to the United States to be trained by Roger Laurin but never raced again and was retired to stud. Assessment There was no International Classification of European two-year-olds in 1975: the official handicappers of Britain, Ireland and France compiled separate rankings for horses which competed in those countries. In the British Free Handicap, Take Your Place was allotted a weight of 128 pounds, making him the second best juvenile colt, five pounds below the top-rated Wollow. The independent Timeform organisation rated him on 125, two pounds below Wollow and five behind the French-trained Manado. In 1976 he was rated 112 by Timeform. Stud record Take Your Place stood as a breeding stallion in the United States for several years before being exported to South Africa, but hd little success in either country. His last reported foals were born in 1994. Take Your Place died in 1995.

As of September 2016, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists 529 vulnerable mammalian species. 9.6% of all evaluated mammalian species are listed as vulnerable. The IUCN also lists 53 mammalian subspecies as vulnerable. Of the subpopulations of mammals evaluated by the IUCN, five species subpopulations and one subspecies subpopulation have been assessed as vulnerable. For a species to be assessed as vulnerable to extinction the best available evidence must meet quantitative criteria set by the IUCN designed to reflect \\"a high risk of extinction in the wild\\". Endangered and critically endangered species also meet the quantitative criteria of vulnerable species, and are listed separately. See: List of endangered mammals, List of critically endangered mammals. Vulnerable, endangered and critically endangered species are collectively referred to as threatened species by the IUCN. Additionally 783 mammalian species (14% of those evaluated) are listed as data deficient, meaning there is insufficient information for a full assessment of conservation status. As these species typically have small distributions and/or populations, they are intrinsically likely to be threatened, according to the IUCN. While the category of data deficient indicates that no assessment of extinction risk has been made for the taxa, the IUCN notes that it may be appropriate to give them \\"the same degree of attention as threatened taxa, at least until their status can be assessed.\\" This is a complete list of vulnerable mammalian species and subspecies evaluated by the IUCN.

Young (born 1979) is a behavioral psychologist and medical school professor with the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He serves as the Executive Director of the University of California, Institute for Prediction Technology (UCIPT) and the UCLA Center for Digital Behavior (CDB).  Background  Young received his undergraduate degree in Ethnomusicology from UCLA, and his master's degree in Health Services Research and PhD in Psychology from Stanford University. Prior to joining UCLA as a postdoctoral fellow, Young worked in technology and user behavior/human factors at the NASA Ames Research Center and Cisco Systems. Since 2011, he has been a professor with the UCLA Department of Family Medicine.  Research interests  Young‚Äôs research focuses on the science behind human behavioral change. He is known for work on a range of issues related to technology, including how to implement social media in behavioral change interventions, how social technologies can predict behavior, wearable sensors, and the relationship between online and offline behavior. He has received grants to study how social media and mobile technologies can be used to predict and change behaviors in the areas of health and medicine, consumer behavior, cybersecurity, and crime. Young has implemented social technologies to address issues related to HIV, drug use prevention, and how to get people to repeat healthy behaviors (e.g., adhere to a medication regimen or exercise routine). As of 2016, he has conducted studies in the United States, Peru, and South Africa, and among homeless youth, undergraduate students, and African American and Latino men who have sex with men. In addition to his research on social networks, Young has become known for studies of how real-time data can be used to monitor disease and substance use‚Äìrelated behaviors. His work in this area focuses on media-sharing websites designed to evaluate people‚Äôs activities, intentions, and social interactions. Insight from the resulting body of data (\\"social big data\\") is used to understand how people think and act in a variety of situations.  Scientific leadership  Young is the Founder and Executive Director of UCIPT and the UCLA CDB. These two interdisciplinary centers were formed to advance research on the use of digital and mobile technologies to understand, predict, and change human behavior. Findings from studies published by the centers have been cited by a wide range of media outlets. As Executive Director of UCIPT, Young is partnering with people from multiple academic fields and business sectors, with the goal of scaling software applications to a diverse range of potential uses. In 2015, Young received the UC President‚Äôs Research Catalyst Award for a multi-campus collaborative project focusing on social big data. Young created the Harnessing Online Peer Education (HOPE) online intervention, which combines behavior change science and social media. HOPE has been used to help change people‚Äôs behaviors in the following areas: HIV and sexual risk behaviors, general health and fitness, drug use, chronic pain management and opioid addiction, and consumer behavior in business. Studies have shown that people who join HOPE communities are two to three times more likely to change their behavior as people who do not join the communities. Young is also a speaker, teacher, and author of Stick with It: A Scientifically Proven Process for Changing Your Life-for Good, the #1 Wall Street Journal Best Selling book. He has presented his work at forums such as the European Parliament, mHealth Conference, and World Congress as well as to corporations and non-profit organizations.

The outside is covered with hairs, the inside surface of the petal lobes is glabrous and the inside of the tube is densely filled with woolly hairs. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed within the tube. Flowering occurs from March to December and is followed by fruits which are hairy, long with a pale yellow-brown papery covering.Leonora E. georgei flower side view Taxonomy and naming Eremophila georgei was first formally described by Ludwig Diels in 1905 and the description was published in Botanische Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr Systematik, Pflanzengeschichte und Pflanzengeographie. The specific epithet (georgei) honours William George, a mine manager on the Mount Margaret goldfields, who collected the type specimen in 1902. Distribution and habitat This eremophila is common in central areas of Western Australia growing in sand, clay and stony soils on flats and rocky ridges in the Avon Wheatbelt, Central Ranges, Coolgardie, Gascoyne, Gibson Desert, Great Victoria Desert, Murchison, Nullarbor and Yalgoo biogeographic regions Conservation status Eremophila georgei is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This eremophila is an attractive species due in part to its large, colourful flowers which are often present over a long period. It can be grown from cuttings or by grafting onto Myoporum rootstock and the latter method is preferable if the shrub is to be grown in heavy soils or in areas of high humidity. Cuttings may take months to strike, even in warm weather. The plant will grow in full sun or dappled shade, needs little watering and is frost tolerant when mature.

(It was not the first Russian research ship, that being the Imperial Russian ship Saint Andrew, which undertook expeditions under the direction of fisheries research pioneer Nikolai Knipovich (and later L. L. Breytfus) from 1899 to 1907.) Perseus was constructed as a sealer (seal hunting ship) by industrialist E. V. Moguƒçim at Onega, Russia on the White Sea in 1916. In 1919 (political conditions and thus ownership having changed) it was towed to Archangel where on January 10 of 1922 the Council of Labor and Defense transferred it to PINRO (), the Nikolai M. Knipovich Polar Research Institute of Marine Fisheries and Oceanography, which equipped it as a research vessel under supervision of the ship's master V. F. Gostev and the first director of the Institute, Ivan Illarionovich Mesjacev. The work was done by shipbuilders and future famous scientists Lev Zenkevich, Vasily Shuleikin, Maria Klenova, and Nikolay Zubov (who later became a Rear Admiral), all of whom later participated in voyages on Perseus. On November 7, 1922, the national flag of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic was raised at the stern of Perseus, and on February 1, 1923 the vessel's unique flag ‚Äì a blue pennant with the seven stars of the Perseus constellation ‚Äì was first flown from the mast. (Since then, this pennant has become the emblem of PINRO.) On 19 August 1923, Perseus began its first scientific voyage. Model of Perseus in the Murmansk Region Museum Over the years of its voyages, Perseus undertook many expeditions (between 80 and 99, according to various estimates) in the northern seas ‚Äì the Barents Sea, Greenland, the Kara Sea, and the coasts of Novaya Zemlya, Franz Josef Land, Jan Mayen, and Svalbard. It took part in the international search for the airship Italia of Umberto Nobile's ill-fated second North Pole expedition. The ship conducted hydrological, scientific, and commercial research, including programs of the second International Polar Year (1932-1933). Through its study of the arms of the Arctic Ocean, Perseus led the way for later Soviet expeditions to all the world's oceans. On July 10, 1941 (during the opening weeks of the Russian Campaign of World War II (called, in Russia, the Great Patriotic War)), the Luftwaffe sank Perseus in Motovsky Gulf, in shallow water just south of the Rybachy Peninsula, while she carried supplies to the garrisons there. Soviet scientist Sergei Obruchev (son of Vladimir Obruchev) wrote a hymn \\"Perseus\\" which contains this quatrain: A memorial stele was erected to Perseus in the town of Onega in 1979. Later vessels were named in Perseuss honor. Perseus 2 was a converted minesweeper (built in 1944) received as German war reparations. After 176 voyages (mainly in the Barents Sea), that introduced many new technologies and greatly advanced Soviet fishery science, it was retired in 1967. In 1969 a much larger purpose-built research ship, Perseus III, began service with PINRO. Perseus III was transferred from PINRO to Vega (an R&D; organization supporting Russian fisheries) in 1991 and decommissioned in 2007.

MacLeamy has served as an industry advocate for the need to leverage new technologies and collaboration tools to improve the practice of architecture. As a founder and chairman of buildingSMART International (formerly the International Alliance for Interoperability), MacLeamy has advanced the global implementation of building information modeling (BIM) to improve the quality and efficiency of the architectural design process. He also supports the establishment of nonproprietary and interoperable standards for the exchange of data in the design and construction industry. MacLeamy established a concept, commonly referenced in the design and construction industry as the MacLeamy Curve, to illustrate the escalating cost of design modifications as a project team progresses in the design process.

His oeuvre ranges from impressionist landscape paintings to detailed drawings and prints of life in the South Carolina Lowcountry. He was active in local arts organizations, helping to found both an art school and an etchers' club. Alfred Hutty, Magnolia Gardens, oil on canvas, 1920. Early years Alfred Heber Hutty was born on September 15, 1877 in Grand Haven, Michigan. His artistic talent won him a scholarship when he was just 15 to study stained glass design at the Kansas City School of Fine Arts. Because of his family's financial situation, he turned down the scholarship and instead went to work in a stained glass factory in Kansas City. He married Bessie Burris Crafton, with whom he had a child, and they moved to St. Louis, where he met the painter L. Birge Harrison. In 1907, he went to Woodstock, New York to study painting with Harrison. To earn money, he took a job with Tiffany Studios in New York City, staying until the outbreak of World War I. While in New York, he also studied with George Bridgman (life drawing) and Frank Vincent DuMond (painting). Hutty served in World War I as an artist working on camouflage of ships. Afterwards, in 1919, he visited Charleston, South Carolina. There is an oft-repeated story that he immediately cabled his wife: \\"Come quickly. Have found heaven.\\" For the remainder of his life, he split his time between Charleston, where he lived during the winters, and Woodstock, where he had a summer house named Broadview on an old farm property. He is considered a founder of the Woodstock Art Colony. Art career Hutty first established himself in Woodstock as a painter of evocative, impressionist landscapes in oil and watercolor. After moving to Charleston, he took up etching and drypoint and became nationally known for his quiet, detailed prints of local landscapes (especially trees), street scenes, historical buildings, farm life, and African-American residents. His prints of the South Carolina Lowcountry won a number of awards and medals, including the Scarab Club Medal of the Detroit Institute of Art and the Logan Prize of the Art Institute of Chicago. Along with Alice Ravenel Huger Smith, Anna Heyward Taylor, and Elizabeth O'Neill Verner, he is today considered one of the leading artists of the Charleston Renaissance. Hutty exhibited his work nationally at venues such as the Art Institute of Chicago, the National Academy of Design, and the American Watercolor Society. His work is held by the Gibbes Museum of Art (which has the single largest collection of his work), the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Greenville (SC) County Museum of Art, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the South Carolina State Museum in Columbia, and other museums and libraries. He also painted some murals in Charleston and took part in local historical preservation efforts. Hutty taught from 1920 to 1924 at the Carolina Art Association (whose gallery would later become the Gibbes Museum of Art). He became the first professional director of the then-new Carolina Art Association Art School. Hutty was active in arts organizations. In 1923, he helped to found the Charleston Etchers' Club. He was also a member of the Society of American Etchers, the Allied Artists of America, the National Arts Club, the American Watercolor Society, and other arts organizations. He was the first American artist ever elected to the British Society of the Graphic Arts. Hutty died in Woodstock on June 27, 1954. ReferencesFurther reading *Arnold, Sara C., and Stephen G.

After completing an undergraduate degree in English, he was trained in Biology at University of Michigan before being drafted into the Army. After the war, he joined the U.S. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health Cancer Institute before joining the Salk team responsible for polio vaccine. As a member of the Jonas Salk research team, Youngner contributed in the development of polio vaccine, including techniques for large scale production of poliovirus and the rapid color test measurement of polio virus in living tissue. He is considered \\"one of the seminal figures in contemporary virology and it's been that way for more than 50 years\\" by Arthur S. Levine, senior vice chancellor for the health sciences at University of Pittsburgh. Research by Youngner and colleague Samuel Salvin was also responsible for the discovery of gamma interferon. Youngner was an important early pioneer in vaccine development, testing, and government licensing of drugs before allowing them to market. He was critical of Cutter Laboratories virus manufacturing prior to deaths resulting from Cutter inactivated vaccine. He continued to promote research integrity and actions on misconduct until the end of his career.  Early life  Younger was born in 1920 in Manhattan, New York, where his father was a businessman. When he was seven-years-old Youngner was nearly killed by lobar pneumonia. Education and Manhattan Project Youngner graduated Evander Childs High School, when he was 15 years old, and received a B.A. in English from New York University in 1939. After completing a Sc.D. degree in microbiology at the University of Michigan, Youngner stayed on as a faculty member, and left in 1947 to join the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in Bethesda.Geoff Watts Julius Stuart Youngner Lancet, Volume 389, No. 10087, p2370,17 June 2017, DOI: 10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31574-X Youngner was drafted into basic U.S. Army infantry training. Upon completion he screened at Oak Ridge, Tennessee and assigned to classified research at University of Rochester School of Medicine on uranium salts. The effects of inhaled uranium salts on human tissue was important to the war effort, related to purification of uranium for nuclear research and weapons. Youngner never knew the research was related to weapons until the end of the war. He thought nuclear energy would be used for planes or submarines for transportation.  Career  In 1949, Youngner moved to the University of Pittsburgh to pursue virology at and, subsequently, to the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine for the rest of his career. In 1960 he was appointed Professor of Microbiology. Between 1985 and 1989, he was Chairman of the Department of Microbiology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Working on polio prevention, he was responsible for three key advancements in poliomyelitis vaccine development. 1. He proved a method for separation of monkey kidney cells, which led to techniques for large scale production. 2. He developed a process to prevent infection while retaining ability to vaccinate, and 3. safety testing for batches of vaccine and anti-polio antibodies in test subjects. or in the words of his colleague: \\"‚ÄúJuli figured out how to grow the virus, how to inactivate it, and then he figured how to test the immune response to see if it worked.‚Äù = Trypsinization = Poliovirus particles in cell culture. Youngner demonstrated the separation of monkey kidney cells using the pancreatic enzyme trypsin, a technique previously proven by the Rockefeller Institute could be applied to high titer virus stocks. Applying this method to a single kidney \\"could produce enough raw material for 6000 shots of polio vaccine.\\" This advance in production of virus raw material directly led to vaccine viability. = Titration = The measurement developed by Youngner for safely and quickly testing batches of vaccine and also antibodies to the virus after application were important advancements necessary for vaccine success. Youngner identified that a difference in pH, as indicated by metabolic activity by other researchers, could be used to identify cell cultures infected with virus and also cultures with antibodies to virus. This pH could be easily indicated by phenol red in a tissue-culture system. = Inactivated poliovirus = The Salk vaccine is based upon formalin inactivated wild type virus. The key to effective inactivation depended upon a color test developed by Youngner, which allowed formalin induced viral protein degradation to be accurately plotted. From Youngner's work, formalin application for six days was projected to produce only \\"one live virus particle in 100 million doses of vaccine.\\" By 1954, the first virus trials had immunized 800,000 children against polio. = Temperature-sensitive virus = Youngner studied the role of in-apparent infections in an effort to link a selection of wild type virus to chronic and persistent infections. His team studied the mechanisms of these infections, and also infections of vesicular stomatitis virus, sendai virus, and persistent newcastle disease virus. = First intranasal equine influenza vaccine = Youngner is responsible for the first equine influenza vaccine, based upon cold-adapted influenza virus. Previous methods of vaccination required treatment up to six times per year without adequate protection. In collaboration with Flu Avert I.N., approval was granted for the use of cold- adapted virus that only replicates at temperatures in the respiratory tract, offering \\"unprecedented level of protection in the prevention of equine flu\\" and offering protection for up to twelve months.  Patents  Youngner has contributed patents on Lipid purification and concentration of viruses and vaccines, an important contribution to the reduction of egg protein and associated vaccine induced complications, antitumor processes of Brucella, and numerous contributions to cold adapted influenza virus.Selected Patents   * * Personal life Youngner met and married his first wife, Tula Liakakis, in Michigan, in 1943. They had a son, Stuart, and a daughter, Lisa. Tula died of Hodgkin's Disease in 1963. He married Rina Balter in 1964. They had no children together but were active in the Jewish community in Pittsburgh, PA. He died there after a brief illness.Mark Roth, \\"Obituary: Julius Youngner, Last surviving member of Salk vaccine team,\\" Pittsburgh Post- Gazette (28 April 2017), http://www.post- gazette.com/news/obituaries/2017/04/28/Julius-Youngner-Salk- vaccine/stories/201704280215  See also  * * How A Pittsburgh-Made Polio Vaccine Helped Beat A Disease That Terrified A Nation on 90.5 WESA Pittsburgh's NPR News Station  References  Category:American inventors Category:American medical researchers Category:American virologists Category:American epidemiologists Category:Vaccinologists Category:Polio Category:University of Pittsburgh faculty Category:1920 births Category:2017 deaths Category:University of Michigan alumni Category:Pittsburgh Category:University of Pittsburgh ","title":"Julius Youngner"},{"id":"49233031","text":"Edward J. Garrett (1918‚Äì1982) was an American business executive. He was the Chairman of the Board, President, and CEO of Instrument Systems Corporation (ISC; today Griffon Corporation). Biography Garrett was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1918 and studied engineering at New York University, graduating in 1939. He began his career as a civilian engineer for the Army Corps of Engineers and joined the newly created Reeves Instrument Corporation in 1944. At Reeves, he helped develop EDVAC, one of the first electronic computers. Garrett later joined Loral Electronics Corporation, rising to Vice President by 1961. In 1964, Garrett was named Chairman of the Board and President of Instrument Systems Corporation (ISC), a small defense electronics company founded in College Point, Queens, in 1959. Although ISC was highly regarded for its products, it had struggled financially in its early years. ISC's major stakeholders, including Helmuth W. Waldorf and Lester Avnet, the President of Avnet Electronics Corporation, hired Garrett to reposition the company for future growth. Garrett brought on board his son-in-law, Harvey R. Blau, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, as General Counsel. Following a strategy that had proved successful at Loral, Garrett transformed ISC by closing deficit-ridden plants, seeking civilian markets as well as government research-and-development contracts, and acquiring a wide array of young growth-oriented companies, mainly in defense and commercial electronics and manufacturing. ISC's biggest contracts of the Garrett era exemplified the company's continued ability to leverage innovative technologies it had developed for military or government purposes and apply them to civilian use. For example, after successfully producing communications systems for the U.S. military, ISC's Telephonics subsidiary won multi-year contracts to produce multiplex passenger entertainment systems for the new Boeing 747 and Lockheed L-1011 wide-body airplanes. Garrett's aggressive strategy grew ISC at an astonishing rate, transforming it from a struggling small electronics company to a nationally recognized industrial conglomerate in less than a decade. In 1970, ISC was listed for the first time on the prestigious Fortune 500 list of America's largest companies. As the 1970s progressed, however, Garrett's strategy faced stiff headwinds. Conglomerates had fallen out of favor with investors, U.S. defense spending decreased as the Vietnam War winded down, and two oil crises and the recessions of 1973‚Äì1975 and the early 1980s further diminished ISC's prospects. ISC's revenues fell from $233.25 million in 1974 to $104.3 million in 1982. Garrett implemented divestiture and cost-cutting measures but died at New York University Medical Center from a severe illness on March 9, 1982, before his turnaround plan was fully implemented. He was succeeded by his son-in-law Harvey Blau as Chairman and CEO of ISC. In addition to his role at ISC, Garrett founded the Spencer Heart Fund, a non-profit corporation devoted to the research and development of heart surgery at New York University Medical Center, in 1977. Personal life In 1939, he married Sylvia Jampol; they had two children: Arlene J. Blau (married to Harvey R. Blau) and David B. Garrett. They remained married until his death; she died on November 15, 2015.

It is also known as Crater, the Crater cluster and PSO J174.0675-10.8774. At a distance of it is the most distant Milky Way globular cluster yet known, located in the galactic halo surrounding the Milky Way galaxy. With an age of only 7.5 Gyr, it is likely to have been incorporated into our galaxy long after the formation of the Milky Way, probably during an interaction with the Small Magellanic Cloud. Some analyses initially categorized it as a satellite galaxy, because of the presence of a handful of blue loop stars and a sparsely populated red clump; the existence of some of these types of stars in Laevens 1 would imply relatively recent star formation (within 400 Myr). Such recent formation would be very atypical for a globular cluster; more recent work suggests that some of these stars were erroneously assigned membership of the cluster, distorting the overall result. After removing these, the subsequent reanalysis concluded that Laevens 1 is a faint, intermediate-age globular cluster. Laevens 1 is orbiting the galaxy at approximately the same distance as the ultrafaint dwarf galaxies Leo IV and Leo V. This hints that all three satellites may once have been closely associated before falling together into the Milky Way halo.

He measures at 33.5 inches tall, and is registered with the American Miniature Horse Association (AMHA) and the American Miniature Horse Registry (AMHR) He was purchased by Byrd's End Farm on July 4, 1998, and has been located in Shepherdsville, Ky ever since. He now competes at sanctioned and non-sanctioned Miniature Horse shows, performs therapy work and exhibits at notable events across Kentucky.  Early life  GTR Patricks Vindicator was foaled on April 17, 1994 in South Carolina. His sire was Wrights Vindicator, and his dam was Dell Teras Lulu. He remained in South Carolina for 2‚Äì3 years, and was gelded at this time. In approximately 1997, he was sold to Roger Herald in Lagrange, Kentucky. Here, he received basic training, and was used in a petting zoo for a brief period. On July 4, 1998, Dr. Raymond and Jessica Schaaf purchased GTR Patricks Vindicator and KPM TopGun ( a pinto miniature horse) for their, then one-year- old daughter, Sarah. Between 1998 and 2002, he was trained by Jessica Schaaf to drive and be ridden. Sarah often rode him until she reached the age of seven. His driving career was cut short after he was injured in an accident- the Schaafs do not see it necessary to risk further injury. 250x250px  Show career  GTR Patricks Vindicator began competing in shows in 2002. Many of the County Fairs he and Sarah compete(d) at include the Bullitt County Fair, the Oldham County Fair, the Larue County Fair, The Lawrenceburg Fair, The Spencer County Fair and the Franklin County Fair.

It was based in Greenwich, Connecticut, with other offices in New York and London. FrontPoint was a registered investment adviser in the United States and was wholly owned subsidiary of investment bank Morgan Stanley. After Eisman left the firm, there was an investigation around insider trading. In August 2011 Frontpoint portfolio manager Chip Skowron pleaded guilty to insider trading and obstruction of justice. The remaining fund saw a significant decline in assets under management. It shut down most of its investments in 2011. Morgan Stanley filed a civil lawsuit against Skowron in 2012, calling Skowron a ‚Äúfaithless servant‚Äù. In 2013 Judge Shira Scheindlin of the U.S District Court of the Southern District of New York ruled on a motion for summary judgment that Skowron must forfeit $31 million‚Äî100% of the compensation he earned from the firm between 2007 and 2010‚Äîto his employer, Morgan Stanley. History Frontpoint was founded in November 2000 by three principals. Morgan Stanley purchased an equity position in the company in 2006, when Frontpoint had $5.5 billion in assets under management. Frontpoint became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley. Steve Eisman served as a fund manager for FrontPoint Partners from 2004 until 2011.\\"The Shocking Admission of This Shuttered Hedge Fund Manager\\", US News & World Report. In October 2010 it was announced that Morgan Stanley, while maintaining a minority position, had handed control back to the managers of the firm. In November 2010 the firm was managing $7 billion. In April 2011 the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint against Frontpoint portfolio manager Chip Skowron for trading on inside information and named six Frontpoint funds as relief defendants. In April 2011 Frontpoint agreed to pay the SEC more than $30 million in settlement of charges against Frontpoint. In August 2011, Skowron pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan to conspiracy to engage in insider trading and obstruction of justice. Skowron was sent to prison for five years. Morgan Stanley filed a separate civil lawsuit against Skowron in October 2012, seeking the $33 million it paid the SEC, as well as the entire $32 million it had paid Skowron in compensation from 2007 to 2010.Katz, Basil (9 November 2012). \\"Morgan Stanley sues Ex- FrontPoint manager over insider charges\\", Fox Business. In its lawsuit, Morgan Stanley called Skowron a ‚Äúfaithless servant‚Äù who lied repeatedly to continue being paid by Morgan Stanley and to avoid a blow to his reputation. A.

The judge applied the legal doctrine of \\"faithless servant\\" to require Skowron to return his ill-gotten gains from the use of inside information to his employer, because he had engaged in insider trading, in violation of the firm's code of ethics, and failed to report his insider trading to the company.

There are no remaining ruins of the Walls del Arrabal, leaving some debate as to their extent and the period of their construction. It is possible that the walls were built as early as the 12th century, however they were most likely constructed in 1438. The walls may have been intended to protect people against the plagues that ravaged the city at the time. The walls united the urbanized suburbs of the city and prevented entry of the infected. The Walls del Arrabal were an expansion of the Christian Walls of Madrid built between the 11th and 12th centuries. They were followed by the Walls of Philip II, 1566.  Historical context  Remains of the Muslim Walls of Madrid, in the Cuesta de la Vega, integrated within the Park of Mohamed I. The urban nucleus of Madrid formed around a Muslim fort, and was protected by the Muslim Walls of Madrid ( Arab Walls) built in the 9th century. Following the Reconquista, the fortifications were extended with the Christian Walls of Madrid (a.k.a. Medieval Walls) built between the 11th and 12th centuries to enclose new districts. The city continued to grow eastward, with the population increasing from 5,000 to 12,000 inhabitants from the mid-15th to early 16th century. Although Madrid was small, it was considered important among the Medieval Castilian cities, as it was one of seventeen voting places for courts, held there on occasion. The suburbs, or arrabales, took their names from convents, hermitages and churches constructed outside the Muslim Walls in the 12th century. The first of these, known from 1126, was the arrabel de San Mart√≠n corresponding to the Convent of San Mart√≠n, followed by that of San Gin√©s by the Church of San Gin√©s de Arl√©s. Some writers place the Walls del Arrabal's construction in the mid-12th century, under Henry IV of Castile. Fernando Urgorri dated it to the mid-12th century in Ensanche de Madrid en Tiempos de Juan II y Enrique IV. However, he left out the suburb of Santo Domingo and drew the walls as they existed in 1440, in times of John II of Castile. It may be that these constructions refer to some of the suburbs being fortified individually, as San Mart√≠n and Santo Domingo each had their own walls at some point. According to Le√≥n Pinelo, a new wall was built to accommodate the Castilian and Leon knights who came with Alfonso VIII (r.1158‚Äì1214), the only suburb at that time being San Mart√≠n. Others place the construction between the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries, starting around the space known as the \\"Ca√±os del Peral\\", now the Plaza de Isabel II. Professor Montero Vallejo said that the Walls del Arrabal were built in 1438, under John II. According to Vallejo, it was built mainly for administrative and sanitary purposes, due to a great plague, one of the many misfortunes that struck Madrid during the 15th century. This wall enclosed all the suburbs, including Santa Cruz and San Millan. A hospital, named Del Buen Suceso, was built for plague victims and stood outside the walls, facing the Puerta del Sol; the hospital was closed in 1854. The Walls started from the gate Puerta Cerrada. They surrounded Calle Concepci√≥n Jer√≥nima, Conde de Romanones, Plaza de Jacinto Benavente, Calle Carretas, Plaza de la Puerta del Sol, Calle Preciados or Carmen, Plaza de Santo Domingo, Cuesta de Santo Domingo and Plaza de Isabel II.\\"La Cerca del Arrabal. Un paseo por el siglo XV.\\" Arte de Madrid Later, around 1520, the southern part of the wall was extended to enclose more of the city, starting from the Puerta de Moros, following the present streets San Mill√°n, Duque de Alba, Plaza de Tirso de Molina, and Calle Conde Romanones, and continuing with the original course of the mid-15th century.  Gates and postigos  Tiled street-sign of Puerta del Sol with a historic depiction of the square In the early 16th century, the wall surrounded an area of and had the following 8 gates: *Puerta de la Vega ‚Äì a remnant of the Muslim Walls *Puerta de Moros ‚Äì a gate shared by the Christian Walls *Puerta de la Latina ‚Äì There was originally a gate marking the beginning of the road to Toledo (near the present Calle Toledo).

From here the road to Vallecas led through atochares, the crop fields of Esparto grass. *Puerta del Sol ‚Äì This gate was located in the present Plaza de la Puerta del Sol, and was demolished in 1539 or 1570. The name was a reference to its facade which faced east, toward the sunrise. *Postigo de San Mart√≠n ‚Äì This gate was originally located in the crossing of the current Calle San Mart√≠n and Calle Navas de Tolosa. It was later moved to what is now the Plaza del Callao. It took its name from a nearby convent. *Puerta de Santo Domingo ‚Äì This gate was located in the present Plaza de Santo Domingo, and was the way out to Hortaleza and the Sierra de Guadarrama.

Similar to punta, the paranda is a slower rhythm than punta and reflects Spanish influences. Traditionally, the guitar is played in paranda and not in punta. and its melodies are soulful lamentations. The music style originates from the 19th- century arrival of the Garifuna people to Honduras, where they blended their traditional music with Spanish music genres. The style has spread to places where the Garifuna migrated, but the highest concentration of population and use of the music/dance style persists in Belize, Guatemala and Honduras. The Latin-American influence of paranda is seen in its use of serenade and solemn social commentary accompanied by acoustic guitar. Usually performed by men, the music has a moderate tempo and is characterized by distinctive drum rhythms. The pattern begins with a quarter note and eighth note tapped in the drum center followed by an eighth note tapped on the drum rim. It is related to the parrandas of Venezuela and Puerto Rico, as well as the parang from Trinidad and Tobago, but unlike its counterparts is not derived from religious themes. Garifuna parandas speak of issues relating to men. Also unlike the Venezuelan genre, Garifuna parandas are not traditionally accompanied by string instruments and bands, but instead use a single guitar and voice with rhythm support. Supporting rhythm is typically provided by two drums, which is usual for secular music. The base drum, called the segunda, provides the beat and the smaller drum, called the primero, is used for flourishes to lead the dancers.

Labelled OIH has a significantly higher clearance than other radiopharmaceutical yet developed and is eminently suitable for renography. It is eliminated mainly by tubular secretion. In patients with normally functioning kidneys, 85% of the OIH may be found in the urine 30 minutes after intravenous injection. OIH was first labelled with 131I by Tubis and colleagues (Tubis, Posnick and Nordyke in 1960) and for many years this was the only radiopharmaceutical for renography. 131I has a half-life of 8 days and emits high-energy Œ≥ rays (364 keV) in addition to Œ≤ particles. These physical characteristics were acceptable for probe studies when quantities of the order 1-2 MBq (25-50 ŒºCi) were administered, but they are far from ideal for Œ≥-camera studies which demand a higher activity and a Œ≥ ray emission of lower energy. The introduction of OIH labelled with 123I, with its short physical half-life (13 hours) and its gamma emission of 159 keV has greatly improved the diagnostic potential of renal studies by combining the production of high-quality functional images with the ability to derive a renogram. The only factor limiting its widespread use is restricted availability and the expense involved in its cyclotron production.

There are currently more forcibly displaced individuals in the world than at any other time in history, including 22.5 million refugees, 40.3 million internally displaced peoples, and 2.8 million asylum-seekers in 2016. Forced migration has profound impacts on individuals and families as their lives change suddenly and dramatically. Experiences of modern migrants include the separation of families, dissolution of communities by conflict and disaster, exposure to exploitation, and violence. Migrants remain in prolonged periods of displacement with a median time of 4 years in exile. Migrants often face multiple forms of uniquely intense stressors, such as the death of loved ones, lack of jobs and social support, difficulties in the migratory process, and loss of status and identity. Because many migrants lack access to healthcare in the receiving country, they are often unable to receive appropriate care and continually re-experience the mental trauma of these losses. The cumulative effect may create stress levels so intense that they exceed individuals' adaptive capacities and lead to a failure of the acculturation process. This aggravates other symptoms, including depression, anxiety, headaches, and pain. Extreme stressors that put individuals at risk for Ulysses syndrome, called \\"Ulysses stressors\\", can broadly be characterized into four categories: * Forced loneliness: ** Separation from family and homeland, especially if the immigrant left his or her spouse and children behind ** Social and cultural isolation due to lack of language proficiency or familiar cultural and religious institutions ** Racial discrimination and prejudice in the receiving country * Failure of migratory goals: ** Sense of failure of original reasons for emigration ** Pressure to earn enough money to support family back in the home country ** Lack of opportunities to acquire appropriate legal documentation, obtain work permits, and secure non- exploitative quality jobs ** Poor access to housing and health services, * Dangers of the journey: ** Crowded rafts and boats without life jackets ** Fear of arrest and deportation ** Physical and sexual abuse * Struggle to survive: ** Difficulties procuring basic necessities such as food, water, and shelter Middle-aged and elderly adults are typically more strongly affected than younger people are because they experience a larger loss of status and social mobility, have fewer encounters with people outside of the community through school or work, and are less likely to be exposed to the receiving country's mainstream culture. Moreover, older immigrants typically have greater difficulty learning the receiving country's language, which may substantially impair their ability to understand and interact with the new culture.  Diagnosis  Ulysses syndrome is not a mental disorder, but rather a normal stress response by a healthy individual to an extreme situation that overwhelms the normal psychological mechanisms for coping. By definition, this syndrome cannot be diagnosed if another mental disorder is present. There is currently no DSM-5 criteria for this syndrome. Although often falsely recognized as acute stress disorder, depression, adjustment disorder, or other mental disorders, Ulysses syndrome differs from these pathologies in important ways: * Acute stress disorder: Ulysses syndrome is brought about by chronic exposure to toxic stress, whereas the symptoms of acute stress disorder by definition are limited to one month. * Depression: Although depressed mood is common, Ulysses syndrome does not include many other cardinal symptoms of depression such as apathy or thoughts of death. Immigrants, unlike people suffering from depression, have the motivation to go forward and struggle in order to reunite with their families and have a better life, despite their current difficulties, and do not lose their interests. Rather, they try to maintain their social and professional activities. * Adjustment disorder: One of the central diagnostic criteria for adjustment disorder is distress that is out of proportion to the severity or intensity of the stressor or stressors. On the other hand, Ulysses syndrome is an appropriate response that manifests as anxiety, insomnia, sadness, etc., precisely due to the extreme nature of the stressors. Moreover, deterioration of social and occupational functioning, which is often present in adjustment disorder, does not occur in Ulysses syndrome. * Post-traumatic stress disorder: Both PTSD and Ulysses syndrome stem from a response to fear. However, disturbing thoughts or feelings about traumatic events as well as distress and avoidance of trauma-related cues do not occur in Ulysses syndrome, but does in PTSD, whereas stressors such as social isolation, lack of opportunities, discrimination, and prejudice are common for Ulysses syndrome and not for PTSD. Although clinically distinct from mental health disorders, Ulysses syndrome exists on a spectrum between normal and disease. It can be understood as the extreme limit of normal mental functioning that can still be considered non-pathological. However, an individual with Ulysses syndrome is at greater risk of disease and indeed, at a certain point the stressors may become too intense such that a true clinical mental disorder such as depression or PTSD can develop.  Treatment  Because Ulysses syndrome is a stress response rather than a mental disorder, the natural response for an individual is to return to his or her normal state of health once the stressors are eliminated. Dr. Achotegui, who first described Ulysses Syndrome, makes the analogy to a stalk of bamboo that bends in the wind. Just like bamboo will bend but not break, those who are exposed to Ulysses stressors are brought to the brink of mental instability and are made more vulnerable to mental disorders, but do not have a disorder yet. When the wind subsides, the bamboo will spring back to its normal state, just as those who face these stressors will return to their normal selves if and when the stressors resolve. Preventive measures that may help reduce Ulysses syndrome generally revolve around building mental resilience, such as finding closure after losing loved ones, embracing changes in identity as an opportunity for growth, talking with others who have undergone similar experiences, re-evaluating expectations to be more realistic, and learning to live in the present rather than dwell too deeply in nostalgia. One proposed therapy leverages the ability of community health workers CHWs) to connect with hard to reach populations such as displaced migrants. CHWs better understand the local culture and traditions and may, with the appropriate training, be able to engage affected individuals more effectively. For instance, CHWs can often better advocate for migrant rights and connect migrant populations to the resources necessary to facilitate integration and build community, all of which helps reduce the extreme stressors that lead to Ulysses syndrome.  History  Dr. Joseba Achotegui from the Universitat de Barcelona coined the term \\"Ulysses Syndrome\\" in 2002. It was named after the ancient Greek hero, Odysseus (Ulysses in Latin), who suffered involuntary migration and travelled for 10 years through the Mediterranean to come back home from the decade-long Trojan War. The hardships of his journey are compared to the ones of contemporary migrants, who must struggle with intensely stressful, novel situations in isolation and with little help. Scarcity of their resources makes it impossible to cope with and successfully adapt to the unfamiliar environment of the receiving country, which in turn leads to experiencing a range of detrimental symptoms. There are accounts that cited the Canadian Mercer Rang as the originator of the term. However, Rang described a different condition in 1972, one that is characterized by ill or side effects of extensive diagnostic investigations because of a false- positive result of laboratory screening. Here, the patient is likened to Ulysses as he embarks on a journey that brings more suffering than he had to begin with.  Alternative use of \\"Ulysses Syndrome\\"  The term \\"Ulysses Syndrome\\" has alternatively been used to refer to the psychological and physical sequelae of misdiagnosis due to a false positive result. For instance, a patient who complains of low risk chest pain may be referred for further cardiac work-up by an overcautious physician. These tests in turn may give a positive result due to high sensitivity, which subjects the patient to further testing that ultimately proves to be unnecessary. Victims of this condition experience the stress of being diagnosed with a condition they do not have as well as the physical trauma of invasive testing. There is currently no consensus on the definitive use of the term ‚ÄúUlysses syndrome‚Äù. Nevertheless, Ulysses syndrome as it is used to describe the effects of chronic extreme stress in migrant populations is more in line with the definition of a syndrome as used in the medical field, i.e. a set of signs and symptoms that constitute a disease. Moreover, because migrants who experience chronic stress and fear are frequently incorrectly diagnosed with depression or anxiety, it encapsulates the alternative definition of this condition.

He was born on August 14, 1858 in Georgia, and died in January 1925. An avid believer in the potential and development of African Americans, he devoted his life to cultivating black business in D.C. His interests spanned a variety of activities, and although a lawyer by profession, he dabbled in many areas throughout his time in the capitol. Early life and education Andrew Hilyer was born enslaved in Georgia in the Summer of 1858. When he was still a child, he and his mother became Exodusters, a group of thousands of southern blacks who moved to High Plains states in search of a better life. They fled to Nebraska and he relocated again after the death of his mother, this time to Minneapolis, Minnesota as a freeman. There, he met and befriended several wealthy white families such as the Gale and Pillsbury families. These families helped him in his education, especially in pursuing higher education. He graduated from the Minneapolis High School in 1878. Then, he enrolled in the University of Minnesota, and was the first African American to graduate from there with a B.A. in 1882. In order to further his education and to fuel his interest in law, Hilyer moved to Washington D.C. where he attended Howard University, graduating with an LL.B (1884) and an LL.M (1885). Personal life Mamie Hilyer In 1886, he married Mamie Elizabeth Nichols (1863 - 1916), with whom he had three children: Gale, Franklin and Kathleen. Mamie Elizabeth was a D.C. native whose family had been free for several generations. She was a music enthusiast and a member of the well-known Booklovers Clubs. Seven years after his first wife died in 1916, he married Amanda Victoria Gray (1870-1957). She was a graduate of the Howard School of Pharmacy, the widow of Arthur Gray, who was involved with the Hilyer family in Washington's civic affairs. Professional life Hilyer's first job was as a correspondent for the Northwest Review while he was at Howard University. After his graduation, he took a job as a class II clerk at the Treasury Department and he later on became Secretary Treasurer. Hilyer's most notable impact and significance lie in his innovative organizational activities aimed at developing the black community in Washington, economically, politically, culturally and educationally. At a time when there was a very strong debate within the black community between the advantages of industrial versus liberal, political versus economic development, and the strategies of internal black development versus attempts for equality and assimilation into the mainstream of American life, Hilyer did not see the need to restrict the options for black development. His passion lay in organising opportunities for the betterment of Washington D.C.‚Äôs black business population, and he often worked with white citizens, convincing them to help develop the black economic community through employment and business education. Hilyer was one of the founders and the first president of the Union League of the District of Columbia which was organized in 1892 \\"to advance the moral, material and financial interests of the colored people\\". The Union League published directories of black businesspeople in 1892, 1894, and 1895 and in 1901 published A historical, Biographical and Statistical Study of Colored Washington which was directed and a coordinated by Hilyer. The document recorded 1000 black-owned business by 1901, an impressive leap from the 120 recorded in 1894. His business interests also led him to attend the Paris Exposition of 1900, representing the U.S. Commission, where he organised the ‚ÄúCollective Exhibit of Negroes in Merchandise, Factories and Allied Occupations.‚Äù Because he was a civil servant Hilyer was not able to participate in politics overtly. He was, however, the founder of the Correspondence Club which was designed to influence public opinion, media representation and public policy as they affected the black community. The membership of this club was limited to only twelve people and its existence was never publicized. In essence, the Correspondence Club was a secret lobbying organization for the black race. As a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Hilyer also lent his efforts to the struggle against racial injustices. He showed his support for other empowerment initiatives, and was present at the first meeting of Booker T. Washington‚Äôs National Negro Business League in 1900. He held a position on the Board of Trustees at Howard University and he advocated for liberal and professional education. He was also a supporter of industrial education, participated in Hampton institute conferences, and sent one of his sons, Franklin, to Armstrong, the industrial high school in Washington, D.C. He was also the chairman of the Committee of Business and Labor in D.C. Other Interests Alongside his federal employment, Hilyer also dabbled in real estate investment ‚Äì buying, developing and selling properties. He was also an acclaimed inventor, receiving patents in 1900 for his inventions of a hot-air register and a water evaporator for a hot-air register. He enjoyed literature and the arts, and was a member of the Bethel Literary and Historical Association as well as the Muso-Lit Club. The establishment of the S. Coleridge-Taylor Choral Society was as a result of Hilyer and his first wife. Mamie Elizabeth had a passion for music and through her dedication the pair even managed to organise concerts on two separate occasions at which the Samuel Coleridge-Taylor himself performed. Death Hilyer died at his home on January 13, 1925. Funeral services were held on Jan. 16 in Rankin Memorial Chapel, Howard University, and he was buried in Harmony Cemetery, Washington, D.C. His home is still part of the Howard University campus today and is used for administrative offices.

Plot Uprisings start in the western provinces of the Russian Empire. Peasants seize carts loaded with bread. Magnates and the gentry support them, seeking to get leadership and a union with Poland. Count Wielkopolski becomes leader of nobility. One of his units is commanded by his son, Stanislav (a.k.a. \\"Stas\\"). Russian landowner Count Orlov mercilessly exploits his serfs. Yas Rudenok sends his sister, Maryla, to Kastus Kalinovskiy, the leader of rebellious peasants, to ask for help. By order of the Military Governor-General Count Muravyov to \\"pacify the region\\" the Cossacks are sent. Stanislaw Wielkopolski's squad of Polish Confederates fight with them, but at the same time robs the peasants. Yasya tries to resist, but is beaten. Kalinovskiy shows up with a detachment and tells Stas, with whom he got acquainted when they studied at the St. Petersburg University: \\"It is not with them you are at war.\\" The sentinels report that the enemies are approaching. Stas is forced to ask for Kalinovskiy's help. Peasant groups helps break up the Cossacks and capture a fortified castle where Kalinovskiy bases his general headquarters. At the bazaar Maryla distributes leaflets and Kastus gives a speech, rousing the farmers to the cause. Both are cleverly hiding from the police. Meanwhile, Wielkopolski Sr. tries to win over the peasants on his side: he invites them to his estate, starts a conversation about land, freedom and national unity. Kalinovskiy who is present, warns them to not trust Wielkopolski Sr.; the slogan of the people is bread and land. Kalinovskiy faces attempted capture. Stanislaw who gives chase, is taken as a prisoner by the detachment of Kalinowski. Stas' sister Jadwiga, knowing Kastus from youth, helps her brother to escape. Interests of the nobles and peasants finally diverge. Avengers of Count Muravyov shoot the participants of the uprising, and the magnates and gentry go to the Governor-General of the delegation with a petition of loyalty to the king. Wielkopolski Sr. offers even to place a military unit in his estate in order to catch Kalinowski. At this time Kastus disguised as an officer and with knowledge of the password manages to rob the royal treasury. Muravyov declares Kalinovskiy as an outlaw. Peasant groups storm and capture Wielkopolski's castle. In a duel Kalinowski kills Stanislaw. But the invaders are approaching. The rebels are defeated. The uprising is suppressed.

It also covers Yoshiki's childhood with the X Japan's vocalist Toshi, the suicide of Yoshiki's father when Yoshiki was ten years old, the deaths of two members of the band (guitarist hide and former bassist Taiji), and Yoshiki's various health problems. The film contains interviews with all the current members of the band (Yoshiki, Toshi, guitarists Pata and Sugizo, and bassist Heath), plus interviews and contributions from Western musicians such as Gene Simmons (Kiss), Marilyn Manson, Wes Borland (Limp Bizkit), Richard Fortus (Guns N' Roses), Marc Benioff and George Martin (producer for The Beatles); famous fans such as comic book author Stan Lee; and Japanese musicians influenced by X Japan including Mucc, Ladies Room, Luna Sea, Dir En Grey and Glay. We Are X received praise from some critics for being uplifting and dealing with difficult topics such as role of pain in making music, while others criticized the film for focusing too much attention on Yoshiki rather than the band as a whole.

The film's soundtrack peaked at the UK Rock & Metal Albums Chart and became the first X Japan album to enter the main UK Albums Chart. Plot summary X Japan's story is told through the life of Yoshiki, the band's frontman, drummer, pianist and composer, leading up to their performance at Madison Square Garden on October 11, 2014. It follows his childhood friendship with vocalist Toshi, whom he first met at the age of four. As a child, Yoshiki was given musical instruments as presents, which resulted in him learning to play piano and developing an interest in classical music. When Yoshiki was 10 his father committed suicide. Following this, Yoshiki's mother gave him a drum kit that allowed him to channel his frustration musically, which in turn led him to pursue a path into rock music. As an adult he and Toshi moved to Tokyo and formed the band X Japan, which also resulted in the development of visual kei, a fashion and music movement featuring elaborate hair styles and flamboyant costumes. It then deals with the band's problems, such as the sacking of original bassist Taiji from the group, and Yoshiki's health problems including the requirement to wear a neck brace while drumming and asthma so severe that oxygen tanks were kept backstage for him. In 1997, Toshi was \\"brainwashed\\" by a cult called \\"Home of Heart\\", leading to the group's breakup that year; guitarist hide died five months later in a reported suicide, though the band believe he died accidentally, trying to do a neck-stretching exercise while drunk. The film then looks at Yoshiki following the band's split, where he returned to classical music and composed a piece in honour of the 10th anniversary of the reign of the Emperor Akihito, then the band's reunion in 2007, Taiji's suicide in 2011 eleven months after performing with the group for the first time in 18 years after being arrested in an air rage incident, and their continuing attempts to achieve worldwide success. Throughout the documentary are interviews with the current band members, family members such as Yoshiki's mother, people who worked closely with the band, and other figures from the world of music and entertainment. These include Stan Lee, who co-created a comic book with Yoshiki entitled Blood Red Dragon; western musicians such as Gene Simmons, Wes Borland, Richard Fortus, Marilyn Manson and George Martin; and Japanese bands influenced by X Japan including Mucc, Ladies Room, Luna Sea, Dir En Grey and Glay. Production X Japan at Madison Square Garden in 2014. This show served as the framework of the documentary The film's name comes from the call and response performed by X Japan with the audience during live performances of their self-titled song \\"X\\". Numerous times during a pause in the song a band member, usually Toshi, will yell \\"We are...\\" and the audience responds with \\"X!\\" before the musicians start the last leg of the song. Yoshiki was convinced to do the film by his agent, Marc Geiger of William Morris Endeavor, and according to director Stephen Kijak, had given the film crew a completely free hand. Kijak said he had never heard of X Japan before getting a call from his producer to make the documentary. But upon learning the band's slogan of \\"Psychedelic Violence Crime of Visual Shock\\" he wanted to be a part of it. Despite not having listened to heavy metal since age 13 or 14 in favor of new wave, Kijak was immediately drawn to the band's music, surprised he had never heard it before. He bonded with some of the band members; learning that Kiss' Love Gun was the first album he, Yoshiki and Toshi had ever bought and talking with Sugizo about the British new wave band Japan and its bassist Mick Karn, who was a friend of the guitarist. Principal photography began on October 11, 2014 at X Japan's concert at Madison Square Garden. The documentary was announced on July 5, 2015. The director said that because Yoshiki had been documenting his life and X Japan for decades, the team had a lot of archival footage to dig through and use. One such example is footage of David Lynch directing unreleased videos for the song \\"Longing\\", which Kijak included as Lynch is one of his biggest influences. Kijak revealed that upon thinking of Lynch's use of doppelg√§ngers he was reminded of an interview where Yoshiki said he has two personalities, his public persona and a man wounded by the tragedies in his life. He made this the subtext of the film to have something deeper than the average rockumentary. He said one of the hardest aspects was editorial, trying to balance all the characters, albums and drama with Yoshiki's life and work. Kijak, who is known for music documentaries such as Stones in Exile and Backstreet Boys: Show 'Em What You're Made Of, said in February 2015 that: \\"I might have to quit music films after this one. The story is so unreal, I don't know where else I could go after this.\\" =Title design= The titles were awarded Excellence in Title Design at South by Southwest. They were made by Allison and Anthony Brownmoore of Blue Spill production studio. Kijak's requirement was to \\"blow people off their seats\\". According to Anthony Brownmoore, the project was a challenge, since he \\"was very taken by their [the band's] look but that can also be quite daunting. To try to make something and be creative with something that's already so mad and so creative\\". They worked on the title design for months, syncing it to the song \\"Jade\\" the way that the images would pulsate to Yoshiki's drum beats. When creating the background sequences, they used the band's slogan, Psychedelic Violence Crime of Visual Shock as an inspiration. They used old photos of the band members, pairing them up with pulsating, moving, otherworldly backgrounds, for example they filmed floating fluorescent paint in a fish tank with a GoPro camera. The scene where Toshi appears to be standing on top of a waterfall, was filmed in the couple's own kitchen sink with running tap water, while the camera emerging from the water to show the waterfall was actually filmed in Greece. Adobe After Effects and Smoke was used during the production. Release=Theatrical run and box office= Yoshiki performs during the Q&A; panel in San Francisco We Are X premiered at the Prospector Square Theater on January 23, 2016 as part of the 2016 Sundance Film Festival. Yoshiki and the film team attended the red carpet beforehand and held a Q&A; panel after its screening. The film had several other screenings throughout Park City, Utah that week. It was also shown at the 2016 South by Southwest festival. The film was licensed for distribution in the United States by Drafthouse Films. It had its US premiere on October 21, 2016 at the Nuart Theatre in Los Angeles. Yoshiki and Kijak appeared for the screening and a Q&A.; At the box office, the film made $45,270 in the US and Canada, and $3,124,876 worldwide. The film was scheduled to have its world premiere at the Wembley Arena in London on March 12, 2016. X Japan was to perform at the venue that same day with the event being called \\"X Day.\\" However, due to Pata being diagnosed with life-threatening diverticulitis and a severe blood clot in his portal vein the concert was postponed for almost a year, taking place on March 4, 2017. The film instead made its UK premiere on February 28, 2017 at Picturehouse Cinemas in London, before being released nationwide on March 2. The film was later screened at the postponed Wembley Arena concert on March 4, 2017. Yoshiki toured Europe in October 2017, to promote theatrical releases in different countries. The events included screenings and a Q&A; session. =Critical reception= Stephen Kijak and Yoshiki at a 2016 Q&A; panel for the film in San Francisco. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 78% approval rating with an average score of 6.4/10, based on 23 reviews. Metacritic gave the film a rating of 64 out of 100 based on 10 reviews, describing the reviews as \\"generally favorable\\". Positive comments mentioned the movie's uplifting nature, with Paula Mejia of Newsweek writing that it \\"forces us to grapple with difficult questions of purpose, the inevitable role of pain in art, and how music acts as a force for salvation, as much for the fans as for the musicians who thrash these songs into existence\\". Andy Webster of The New York Times wrote that We Are X was, \\"fascinating and assured documentary\\", but also mentioned what he thought was an unfair R-rating saying: \\"We Are X is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for ‚Äî what? Shredding?\\" Criticism centered on the documentary's focus on Yoshiki rather than on the band as a whole. John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter said that while the film does cover the deaths of two X Japan members and the \\"brainwashing\\" of Toshi, it spends more time following the drummer at press and preparations for Madison Square Garden. Josiah Hughes of Exclaim! made similar comments and noted typos in the English subtitles. Hughes gave the film an 8 out of 10 and observed that these were small complaints against an otherwise \\"outstanding rock documentary.\\" The movie was given ratings of 3 stars out of 5 by reviews in The Guardian, the New York Daily News and Time Out London with views range from the film being: \\"A watchable and interesting ‚Äì if a tad worshipful\\", \\"an accessible ride, if not a particularly unique one\\", and that, \\"Kijak‚Äôs willingness to indulge the band‚Äôs rampant self-mythologising can get tiresome\\". The Village Voice was more critical saying it was, \\"a maddeningly vague primer. ... All director Stephen Kijak's frustrated attempts at getting into Yoshiki's head leave little time for viewers to hear much of what X Japan's music actually sounds like.\\" =Accolades and recognitions= We Are X was entered in Sundance's World Cinema Documentary Competition, winning the Special Jury Award for Best Editing. It also won the Audience Award for Excellence in Title Design at South by Southwest. We Are X was nominated for the Golden Goblet award for Best Documentary at the 2016 Shanghai International Film Festival. It was also nominated for the inaugural Best Music Documentary award at the 22nd Critics' Choice Awards. On December 13, 2016, it was announced that the film's ending theme song \\"La Venus\\" was one of 91 songs in contention for nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 89th Academy Awards. The January 2018 issue of Neo named We Are X the \\"Best Asian Movie\\" in their annual awards. In March 2018, the film won the \\"Best Music Film\\" award at the Space Shower Music Awards in Japan. Yahoo! Music named it number 4 on their list of the 10 Best Music Documentaries of 2016. When the film was released in the UK, We Are X reached number 2 in the Official Charts Company's Music Video chart, and the Blu-Ray Steelbook version of the film reached number 50 in the Blu-Ray chart in the first week of its release. =Home media= The film's home video rights were acquired by Magnolia Home Entertainment, who released it on Blu-ray, DVD and Digital HD in the US on April 25, 2017. In the UK, the rights to the film were picked up by Manga Entertainment, who released the film on Blu-Ray Steelbook with cover art by Becky Cloonan, and DVD on May 22, 2017. The release's extras are an eight- page booklet; deleted scenes featuring an interview with Yuko Yamaguchi the creator of a Yoshiki-themed Hello Kitty doll named \\"Yoshikitty\\", footage of Yoshiki attending Hello Kitty Con, Yoshiki appearing at the New Economy Summit, and Yoshiki revisiting his hometown of Tateyama, Chiba; extended interviews with X Japan's current band members; a series of promotional video interviews with Yoshiki discussing the film; video performances of the songs \\"Kurenai\\" and \\"Forever Love\\" from The Last Live concert; and a fan video of the song \\"Born to Be Free\\". Francis Rizzo III from DVD Talk commented on the quality of the release saying that visually it is of mixed quality, but he also added that: \\"Black levels are solid, and there are no issues with digital distractions (other than those inherent in the archival footage)\\", and praised the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track. Soundtrack The soundtrack to We Are X was released on March 3, 2017. In the first week of the release of the album it reached number 4 in Japan's Oricon Albums Chart.

The band have developed a cult following, with original members Gary Green and Malcolm Mortimore, joined in the current line- up by Neil Angilley, Charlotte Glasson, and Jonathan Noyce. Band history In 2008, a partial reunion of Gentle Giant involved the creation of a new band called Rentle Giant, in order to play Gentle Giant material. This band featured the former members: guitarist Gary Green and, drummer Malcolm Mortimore. They recruited three noted jazz-fusion musicians to complete the band, with Roger Carey on bass and vocals, Andy Williams on guitar, and John Donaldson on piano and keyboards. Green contributed lead vocals to some of the songs. In March 2009, Green and Mortimore were joined by a third Gentle Giant member in the form of Kerry Minnear and Rentle Giant consequently changed its name to Three Friends. Also at this time, the band vocalist Mick Wilson, as dedicated lead singer. After a short tour, it was announced that Minnear was leaving the band for personal reasons, and that Three Friends planned to continue as a six-piece. In due course, by 2011, Carey, Williams and Donaldson had left the band, to be replaced by Lee Pomeroy on bass and Gary Sanctuary on keyboards. Charlotte Glasson joined in 2012, adding violin, baritone sax, alto sax and recorder, enabling the band to create a live sound closer to the original recordings. This line-up toured Italy, Canada and the United States in 2012. The current line-up of the band was assembled to play at Cruise to the Edge 2014 (7-12 April 2014, Isla de Roatan, Honduras & Cozumel, Mexico) and subsequently appearing at Gouveia Art Rock Festival in Portugal on 26 April 2014. In the run up to a scheduled performance at Cruise to the Edge 2015, Gary Green suffered a mild heart attack and was found to be suffering from coronary heart disease. He underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which made his participation in the concerts impossible. Rather than withdraw from the concerts, the remaining members of the band performed without a lead guitarist, with Green's guitar lines shared between alto sax and keyboards. While a tour of Europe planned for Spring 2016 was delayed, Green was expected to make a full recovery.

Hanging scroll, ink and colour on silk. The Palace Museum, Beijing was a school of painting which flourished in Nagasaki during the Edo period.  Etymology  It takes its name from Chinese painter Shen Nanping or Shen Quan (; c. 1682‚Äì1760), an artist who painted in the Ming academic style.  History  He arrived in Nagasaki on the 37th ship on December 3, 1731, and left Japan two years later, on September 18, 1733.Kond≈ç Hidemi, 1989, \\"Shen Nanpin‚Äôs Japanese roots\\", in Ars Orientalis, Vol. 19, pp. 79‚Äì102. Shen Nanping specialised in bird-and-flower painting (Ch: huaniao hua, J: kach≈çga), one of the major artistic subjects, especially among professional Chinese painters. The painting style of Shen Nanping and his school would therefore be fruit of an artistic investigation. In their paintings, flora and fauna are not just \\"realistic\\", but are styled just as they appear in Chinese and European treatises. The commercial activity in the port of Nagasaki facilitated the spread of Western knowledge in Japan. Japanese people were particularly interested in the ancient Chinese culture. In the 18th century, Japanese people became very interested in Western natural sciences, even if that did not mean a break from Chinese tradition. Chinese and Western treatises on natural sciences could have played a key role in the spread of knowledge on subjects such as botany, zoology, and mineralogy, and that the images featured in these treatises might have inspired artists to choose and create new representations of bird-and-flower. That is why scholar Meccarelli has called the style of the Nanpin school \\"flora and fauna decorative painting'.Marco, Meccarelli. 2015. \\"Chinese Painters in Nagasaki: Style and Artistic Contaminatio during the Tokugawa Period (1603‚Äì1868)\\" in Ming Qing Studies 2015, pp. 175‚Äì236. In the Nanping painting school, the decorative aspect was even more emphasised, because paintings had to satisfy the taste of merchants.Charles D.

The latter was originally recorded by Conway Twitty on his 1993 album Final Touches, which, like Stuart's version, was produced by Don Cook. Reception Jana Pendragon of Allmusic rated the album 4.5 out of 5 stars, saying that \\"This is a hits package that shows off Marty Stuart's hard-earned success with tongue firmly planted in cheek.\\" Jay Orr of New Country rated the compilation 3 out of 5 stars. His review criticized the album as \\"more like a marketing concept than a career move\\" due to only six of the songs coming from Stuart's own albums.

Garvan's thesis, Generalizations of Dyson's rank, concerned the rank of a partition and formed the groundwork for several of his later papers. Garvan is well-known for his work in the fields of q-series and integer partitions. Most famously, in 1988, Garvan and Andrews discovered a definition of the crank of a partition. The crank of a partition is an elusive combinatorial statistic similar to the rank of a partition which provides a key to the study of Ramanujan congruences in partition theory. It was first described by Freeman Dyson in a paper on ranks for the journal Eureka in 1944.

El-Erian. Summary El-Erian argues that, forced to take on massive policy responsibilities with inevitably partial tools, central banks only managed to put a band-aid on the consequences of the Great Recession, and that a continued period of low-growth and financial repression is not sustainable for much longer. The global economy and markets are on what he calls a \\"T junction\\". The current path being our pursued ‚Äì or what he labeled back in 2009 as the \\"new normal\\" ‚Äì will likely end within the next three years; and to illustrate this, the book identifies the mounting tensions and inherent contradictions that are becoming more visible at the domestic, regional and global levels. But what comes thereafter is not as yet pre-destined. It depends on choices that are made by governments and other members of society. One road out of the T junction involves even lower growth, periodic recessions and financial instability; and it is a road that will fuel even greater political dysfunction, a worsening of what he calls the inequality trifecta (that of income, wealth and opportunity), and social tensions. The other road is one that unleashes the considerable productive capacity of the global economy, which is then turbocharged by the deployment of corporate cash sitting on the sidelines and exciting innovations. El-Erian then identifies the key drivers of each. Reviewing how they have ended up as the only game in town policy-wise, El- Erian argues that, by necessity rather than choice, central banks have ended carrying too many responsibilities for policy decisions in recent years, and that politicians need to, and must, play a more active role in shaping policy. Providing details, El-Erian suggests fixing the Great Recession for good will entail a four-pronged approach: fostering economic growth through structural reforms; encouraging greater balance in aggregate demand, including more inclusive access to consumption; implementing debt reduction in areas where crippling debt overhangs are destroying potential; and spearheading global coordination of economic policy.. Some policy measures include \\"revamping the education system, strengthening infrastructure, improving labour competitiveness and flexibility, while simultaneously closing tax loopholes and increasing marginal tax rates on the wealthy in order to reduce inequality.\\" Given the \\"unusual uncertainty\\" associated with the T junction, the book also discusses the challenges facing sound decision making by governments, households and companies. Using the insights of behavioral science, he points to the most common mistakes that are made in such circumstances, and provides guidance on what can be done to address blind spots, unconscious biases and other inherent challenges. Critical reception Financial Times What better moment could there be for a book subtitled \\"Central Banks, Instability, and Avoiding the Next Collapse\\"? And who better to write it than Mohamed El-Erian‚Äî the man who captured the essence of the present era of low growth, low inflation and low investment returns better than anyone else with his memorable concept of the \\"new normal\\"? It is refreshing to read a policy book with the confidence to say that it is pointless to dispense elevator- pitch solutions to epochal economic challenges. New York Times El-Erian expertly offers a balanced view, commending the central banks for their necessarily aggressive policy views while noting, for example, the failure of the Fed to recognize the pre-crisis housing bubble. But title aside, this is hardly just a book about central banks. Instead, El-Erian offers a grand tour of the challenges we face, along with ideal solutions and more likely outcomes. He even dips into subjects of questionable relevance, like cognitive diversity and cultural bias. name=nytimes Time Magazine If you want to understand this bifurcated world and where it's headed, there is no better interpreter than Mohamed El-Erian. El-Erian is the former CEO of PIMCO, the world's largest bond trading firm, and now the chief strategist for insurance giant Allianz. His new book, \\"The Only Game in Town: Central Banks, Instability and Avoiding the Next Collapse‚Äù (Random House), is an excellent primer on how we got here and what to expect as the world struggles to cope with slower, less equal growth and the resulting populism, nationalism and ugly partisan politics that we see in countries from the U.S. to France to China. The Economist Mohamed El-Erian, a former IMF economist and executive at the Pimco fund management group, is the latest to sound the alarm. While central banks \\"averted tremendous human suffering\\", he argues that they have failed to generate what the Western world really needs‚Äî\\"the combination of high, durable and inclusive growth together with genuine financial stability\\". Worse still, politicians have come to rely on central bankers to provide the main source of economic stimulus. As a result, Mr El-Erian asserts, they have failed to force through reforms that were badly needed. The long period of easy monetary policy has pushed up asset prices and thus wealth inequality. It has also meant that the appetite for financial risks (market speculation, in other words) is greater than the willingness of businesses to take economic risks by increasing investment. Publishers Weekly It is suggested the main thesis of the book was \\"well-informed, if sometimes overstretched,\\" but they criticized its forays into \\"trendy but less relevant territory with references to \\"cognitive diversity\\" and quotes from Sheryl Sandberg.\\" However, they praised its \\"prescient warning against our current overreliance on central banks.\\" References Category:2016 non-fiction books Category:Non-fiction books about the Great Recession ","title":"The Only Game in Town (El-Erian book)"},{"id":"49234325","text":"Alfonso Carrillo de Albornoz (also Alonso Carrillo de Albornoz) (died 14 June 1514) was a Roman Catholic prelate who served as Bishop of √Åvila (1496‚Äì1498) (in Latin) and Bishop of Catania (1486‚Äì1496).

His father, Zafar Ali Ahmed, was a lawyer at Tufanganj court. His early education was from schools and a college of North Bengal. He came closer to music through the cultural programme at schools and colleges. He was largely a self-taught song composer and singer. For a brief period he learned music from Ustad Jamiruddin Khan in Kolkata.  Career  Ahmed (left) with Allauddin Khan and Qazi Motahar Hossain (1955) Ahmed started his career by singing modern Bangla songs for the HMV studios, followed by modern songs of poet Kazi Nazrul Islam, the national poet of Bangladesh. He then proposed to Nazrul Islam to write and tune Islamic songs, which he sang in numerous numbers and recorded for the HMV studios. He has a pioneering role in bringing the music to the home of the Indian Muslims and arousing them from a state of backwardness. He was the first Muslim in erstwhile India who used his own name in the record labels. Before Abbassddin Ahmed, Muslim singers would use pseudo names, so that their Muslim identity would be anonymous. He later recorded Bhawaiya, Khirol and Chatka which were famous in Cooch Behar and Rangpur. Later he started to sing other folk songs like jaari, sari, bhatiyali, murshidi, bichchhedi (songs of estrangement), marsiya, dehatattwa, and musical plays.

Situated in Emdrup, just north of Emdrup station, it was created when the Danish University of Education (Danmarks P√¶dagogosike Universitet, DPU) was merged with Aarhus University in 2007. An expansion of the campus is planned and it will in the future also host activities within the areas of biosciences, energy and environmental studies. History The large auditorium before Hacring's redesign in 1947-50 The campus traces its history back to 1872 when the teacher training college Blaagaard Seminarium moved to the site. It had been founded by the educator Jeppe Tang at Bl√•g√•rdsgade (No. 14) and already moved several times. The school was destroyed by fire but rebuilt in 1879. It closed in 1913 and the buildings were then left empty until they were purchased by Copenhagen Municipality in 1917. The site was taken over by Die Deutsche Schule shortly after the German Occupation of Denmark in 1940. The German architect Werner March was charged with the design of a \\"Reichdeutsche Schulen, Sportanlagen under Kinderg√§rten\\" for children of the occupying German forces. The first part of the complex, two wings and a watch tower was largely completed in 1942 but construction then went on hold due to the shortage of building materials and it was never completed. After the war the buildings were initially used for housing refugees and various military activities. The guardtower was seen as a symbol of the German occupation and its spire was pulled down just a few months after the liberation in May 1945. In 1947, royal building inspector Thomas Havning was tasked with completing the buildings for the Royal Danish School of Educational Studies (Danmarks L√¶rerh√∏jskole), Statsseminariet and K√∏benhavns Kommunale Fors√∏gsskole. He changed the fa√ßade, shortened the tower and redesigned the interior with use of wood instead of artificial stone. C.Th. S√∏rensen created a new garden plan in 1949. In 1957, Havning designed the Emdrupborgkollegiet dormitory. A laboratory building designed by Sven Eske- Kristensen was built in the southwestern corner of the campus area in 1979. The Danish University of Education was established on 1 July 2000 through the merger of the Royal Danish School of Educational Studies, the Danish National Institute for Educational Research, the Danish School of Advanced Pedagogy and the Danish National Centre for Technology-Supported Learning. Its status changed from independent university to a university school at the University of Aarhus when DPU merged with Aarhus University on 1 June 2007. Dormitory A new Emdrupborg Kollegium dormitory was built in 2009. It is located at Emdrupborgvej 54 A-C, across the street from Institut for Uddannelse og P√¶dagogik (IUP/DPU) and consists of three four-storey buildings with 111 rooms in total. Each floor has a common kitchen and all rooms are equipped with a kitchenette, a small refrigerator, and a bathroom. Other facilities include an assembly room, fitness room, and laundry room. Expansion Aarhus University is planning an expansion of their Emdrup Campus with a new 13,000 square metre building. The building will house National Center for Environment and Energy (DVI), Institute for Environmental Sciences, Institute for Biosciences as well as administrative functions.

Trained in chemistry at Northwestern University, she became a leader in collaborative science aimed at discovering and developing bioactive molecules as therapeutic agents, with her contributions proceeding from application of methods to understand how descriptors of molecular shapes and physicochemical properties relate to their biological activity. She is the author of a seminal volume in cheminformatics, Quantitative Drug Design (2nd Ed., 2010), and has been the recipient of numerous awards in her field, including being named as a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1985) and of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (2000), and receiving the Herman Skolnik Award (2009) and the Award for Computers in Chemical and Pharmaceutical Research (2017) from the American Chemical Society.  Early life and education  Yvonne Connolly was born to Irene and Elvert Connolly in 1936. Martin received a bachelor's degree in 1958 from Carleton College, Northfield, Minnesota. She was the only woman to be a chemistry/zoology major in her year. From 1958 to 1960 she worked as a pharmacology assistant at Abbott Labs. She was awarded a predoctoral fellowship from the National Science Foundation for the years 1960-1963, attending Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois. She received her Ph.D. in physical biochemistry from Northwestern University in 1964.  Career  Martin's career has been almost exclusively with the division of Abbott Laboratories that was involved with preclinical drug discovery initiatives, a division that was spun off from that biomedical conglomerate to become the standalone pharmaceutical company, AbbVie. Martin's career at Abbott and AbbVie extended over forty years, interrupted only a sabbatical year, 1967 to 1968, that she spent working with QSAR pioneer Corwin Hansch at Pomona College, after which she returned to Abbott Laboratories. Martin formally retired as a senior research fellow in 2006, but has continued to be associated with Abbott Laboratories on a contract basis, working on topics in which she is interested. She has also taught as a visiting professor at the University of Virginia.  Research interests  Martin's work with Corwin Hansch led to her ongoing work in QSAR, using computers to develop both 2D and 3D models capturing the chemical and biological properties of molecules. As an early proponent of computational chemistry and its use in drug design, she developed combinatorial chemistry and molecular graphics techniques and was involved in the development of software packages for pharmacophore analysis such as DISCO and ALADDIN. Her work has directly affected modern day drug discovery and supported the computer design of novel compounds. Martin has particularly focused on identifying properties of molecules relevant to biological activity, including their potency, binding affinity, and ADME properties. Her methods have been applied to the study of diseases including hypertension, Parkinson‚Äôs disease, ulcers, bacterial infections, arthritis, and angina. She has also significantly contributed to the development of compound collections and combinatorial libraries which investigators can use to develop and compare measures of molecular similarity and diversity. Her collection of MAO (monoamine oxidase) inhibitors has been widely used by researchers.  Other activities  In 1989 Martin helped to found the International Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship & Modeling Society (now called the Cheminformatics and QSAR Society). She served as a board member and was chair of the organization from 2001 to 2005.  Published works  In addition to more than a hundred scholarly publications, she has written or edited six books. These include her textbook on Quantitative Drug Design. Editorially, she has worked on Perspectives in Drug Design and Discovery, QSAR: Annual Reports in Computational Chemistry, Journal of Computer-Aided Drug Design and QSAR & Combinatorial Science. She has registered eight patents. She is listed in the World directory of crystallographers : and of other scientists employing crystallographic methods.

Composed in Sanskrit, the text is classified as a Shakta Upanishad and attached to the Rigveda. It is, as an Upanishad, a part of the corpus of Vedanta literature collection that present the philosophical concepts of Hinduism. The Tripura Upanishad places the goddess Tripura Sundari as the ultimate Shakti (energy, power) of the universe. She is described as the supreme consciousness, above Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. The text is one of the important texts of the Shakta tradition and notable for its theory of Tripura (literally \\"three cities\\") symbolizing the three roads of work, worship and wisdom. Douglas Brooks states the text is historically notable as being \\"as close to an introduction to Shakta Tantrism as we may find\\", distilling into its 16 verses almost every important topic in Shakta Tantra tradition. The text presents the Srividya yantra as a means of meditation. The text links the Shakti Tantra tradition as a Vedic attribute, however this link has been contested by scholars. The philosophical premises in this text as in many Shakta Upanishads, states June McDaniel, is syncretism of Samkhya and Advaita Vedanta schools of Hindu philosophy, called Shaktadavaitavada (literally, the path of nondualistic Shakti). History The author and the date when Tripura Upanishad was composed are unknown. The text was likely composed, in the same period as other Shakta Upanishads, between the 12th- and 15th-century CE. Buhnemann suggests the Tripura Upanishad was probably composed after the 15th-century CE.Gudrun Buhnemann (1996), Review: The Secret of the Three Cities: An Introduction to Hindu ≈öakta Tantrism, Journal of the American Oriental Society, Volume 116, Number 3, page 606 While this text is a relatively late composition in the Upanishadic collection, literary evidence confirms that Shakta Tantrism has roots in ancient times and the interaction between Vedic and Tantric traditions trace back to at least the sixth century, and the surge in Tantra tradition developments during the late medieval period, states Geoffrey Samuel, were a means to confront and cope with Islamic invasions and political instability in and after 14th-century CE in parts of India and Tibet.Geoffrey Samuel (2010), Tantric Revisionings, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 60‚Äì61, 87‚Äì88, 351‚Äì356 The text was translated by AG Krishna Warrier in 1967. However, scholarly reviews such as those by Brooks have questioned the translation and its conservative modern interpretation that is inconsistent with how the text was interpreted by 15th- to 18th- century Indian scholars such as Bhaskararaya in their bhasya (review and commentary). The Upanishad has survived into the modern times in two recensions, one attached to the Rigveda and other to the Atharvaveda. Manuscripts of this text are also found titled as Tripuropanisad.Vedic Literature, Volume 1, , Government of Tamil Nadu, Madras, India, pages 267, 270, 413‚Äì415 In the Telugu language anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, it is listed at number 82. The Tripura Upanishad is complemented by Bhavana Upanishad, and the text accompanies the tantra rituals text Parasurama Kalpasutra in Shakta traditions. =Name= The title Tripura means \\"three cities\\". It refers to the Tantric idea that everything including the transcendental reality is of triadic form and function, manifesting from one unity. The triads occur, for example, as \\"creator, creation, and the process of creativity\\", \\"will, action and knowledge\\", \\"knower, object of knowledge, and the process of knowing\\", three Devas, three Shaktis (energies), three svaras (musical notes), and others. These all devolve into and are symbolized as Tripura. She is epistemologically envisioned, states Brooks, as \\"the measurer, the measuring and the thing measured\\"; she has the nature of Shiva, Shakti and Atman (soul, self); she is all creation in latent and manifested forms; and she establishes the nondualistic identity of the Absolute Brahman with the individual soul (Atman), states Brooks. The term Upanishad means it is knowledge or \\"hidden doctrine\\" text that belongs to the corpus of Vedanta literature collection presenting the philosophical concepts of Hinduism and considered the highest purpose of its scripture, the Vedas.Max Muller, The Upanishads, Part 1, Oxford University Press, page LXXXVI footnote 1, 22, verse 13.4 Contents Srichakra above. Some recensions of the manuscripts include a prelude and an epilogue in the form of a prayer asserting that the Vedas must be imbibed in one‚Äôs mind, thoughts and speech, and through truth only is peace assured. The main text consists of 16 verses. This number 16 is significant in the Tantra tradition, and constitutes the sixteen syllabic structure of the Mula-Mantra, or root manta of its Srividya's school. The main message is contained in its 15 verses, to which a sixteenth verse is appended, exactly like the way the yantra is designed wherein the sixteenth syllable is appended to its core fifteen elements. Thus the architectural elements of the Upanishad mirror the architecture of the Srividya mantra. The Srividya presented in the Tripura Upanishad, has been described by the medieval Tantra scholar Bhaskararaya to one of realizing that \\"Devi within each human being is a means to know and attain one's own real nature\\", that personal liberation and freedom (moksha) is a \\"process of reintegration\\", a journey of knowing one's inner roots and returning to it. It is a path to become one with Ultimate Reality, the Brahman. Genuine religious freedom, asserts Bhaskararaya in his commentary on Tripura Upanishad, is achievable only with autonomy and realization of one's nature. The text is considered, in Shakta tradition, to be rooted in Rigveda hymns, with Rig hymn 5.47.4 considered as a form of Srividya, the most important mantra in many Shakti traditions. However, this claim of Rig Vedic roots has been controversial, and is disputed as an esoteric interpretation, by mainstream orthodox traditions of Hindu philosophy, states Brooks.Hugh Urban (1997), Elitism and Esotericism: Strategies of Secrecy and Power in South Indian Tantra and French Freemasonry, Journal: Numen, Volume 44, Issue 1, pages 1 ‚Äì 38 The text introduces goddess Tripura in verses 1 through 5 as supreme Shakti. The triadic theology permeates the construction of the verses as well as the message. Thus, states Brooks, she is presented as the Sthularupa (literally, physical anthropomorphic icon), Suksmarupa (subtle sound, mantra icon), and Pararupa (transcendent diagrammatic, yantra icon). The Upasana (contemplative worship) is similarly presented as the triad of Bahiryaga (outer devotion), Japa (silent repetition), and Antaryaga (inner devotion). Verses 2 and 3 also states that goddess Tripura is symbolized in nine ways, nine yogas, nine gods, nine healing deities, nine communicative forms representing all the three energies, and controlling the numerals, nine nineteen, twenty-nine, and ever radiant. Her worship through various methods of meditation is asserted by the text to lead to liberation. The verse 6 of the Upanishad succinctly presents her relationship with Shiva, and introduces the names of fifteen goddesses, each an aspect of her as the sixteenth. The verses 8 and 9 of the text, states Brooks, present the syllables of its mantras in a technical, encoded vocabulary, whose details and meaning in the Tantra tradition is passed verbally from one generation to another, through a Guru. The text presents the encrypted code, but unlike other Upanishads in the Hindu tradition, does not explain or provide an outline of the code's esoteric meanings. These mantras of the Tripura Upanishad are also referred to as Kadi vidya and Hadi vidya. The verses 10 through 12 state the upasana rituals and Srichakra worship, in verbal and diagrammatic images of Tripura, Shiva and self. The verse 13 is dedicated to meditation practice. Verses 14‚Äì15 assert ontological oneness between Shakti, Shiva and Atman, with the statement that through \\"knowledge that the self becomes one with Cosmic being\\".

History In 1993, the park area was actually designed to be Park No. 18 by Tainan City Government in which the city government should carry out the construction project within the same year. However, due to land ownership disputes between Tainan City and Tainan County, the land failed to be developed which caused the park to remain idle since then. After a decade without proper management, the park was flooded with wild plants and trashes, which eventually turned out to be a landfill. In 2001, the chief of Chongming Village had an idea of rejuvenate the park area and turn it into a beautiful park. Thus soon afterwards, cleanup efforts was initiated by him and his friends, gradually expanded to 57 volunteers. Eventually, more and more people helped to rebuild the park. Vehicles coming in and out to dispose the rubbish. They built the slopes of the creek course, repaved the walking paths, trimmed the plants and repopulated the park with fireflies.

Biography  Mageean was born in Gosforth. The eldest of four children having two brothers, Patrick and Peter, and a sister, Sheila. His father Charlie Mageean was part of a riveting gang in the Tyne shipyards at that time but soon after became a coal miner: \\"I asked my dad once if he was present at my birth and he said that Newcastle United were playing at home to Stoke City that day so, of course, he was at the match!\\" Mageean spent his early years in a mining village, Coxlodge, where he attended a small village school. He started singing as a very young child, learning songs from his grandmother, Elsie, but did not know they were folk songs until much later. His parents, Peggy and Charlie Mageean, were both good singers and often had late night singing parties in the house, particularly at New Year. Mageean soon found out that if you could sing then you could stay up late at the party so he learned several Geordie songs. In 1963 he went to his first folk club as a teenager at The Bridge, Newcastle upon Tyne. Then in 1964 he went to his first folk festival in Scarborough, North Yorkshire. There he met Stan Hugill who was singing with The Spinners at the time. He started writing to Stan and invited him to Newcastle where he did a short tour. They became good friends and remained so until Hugill's death in 1992. He was educated at Newcastle Polytechnic (now Northumbria University) where he obtained a degree in Physics and became a Chartered Engineer. He later studied for a P.G.C.E to allow him to teach. He spent ten years of his life in London singing as a resident in several of the folk clubs including ‚ÄòHerga‚Äô, ‚ÄòDingles‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Cellar‚Äô in Cecil Sharp House and working in Engineering and Education but later returned to his native North East as a Senior Lecturer in Engineering at Newcastle College. In 1983 he and Johnny Collins, performing as a duo, won the Intervision Song Contest in Rostock, in East Germany. Later, in 1987, they were invited by the East German government to perform at a sea shanty festival in Berlin commemorating the city's founding. Mageean and Collins performed together until 2009 when Johnny Collins died on tour in Gda≈Ñsk, Poland. For 35 years Mageean and Collins sang at festivals and concerts throughout Europe, and North America and performed in France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Scandinavia, Poland, United States and Canada. In 1986 the Cutty Sark Tall Ships Race came to Newcastle for the first time and he was asked to form a shanty group to perform there. He formed The Keelers who are still performing 3 decades and 5 albums later. He has also been involved in duos with both Graeme Knights from London and Pat Sheridan from Cork. He also sings in a trio with Barrie and Ingrid Temple called ‚ÄòJIB‚Äô (Jim, Ingrid & Barrie). In 2010 Mageean appeared on BBC Four's Shanties and Sea Songs with Gareth Malone to discuss North East sea songs and Grace Darling. In 2013 BBC Radio 2 Mageean was interviewed about shanties by Richard Hawley as part of his 'The Drunken Sailor' program. The show was well received and was featured in BBC Radio 4's 'Pick of the week.' He tutored for a while on the Folk Music Degree course at Newcastle University and passed some of his songs on to the students there as well as to other young groups, in particular The Unthanks and The Young'uns, the latter of which personally thanked him when they won 'Best Group' in the 2015 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. He now resides in Cullercoats, Newcastle Upon Tyne He has three children, Tam, Joby and Rose. =Master and Commander= Mageean's arrangement of the song \\"Don't Forget Your Old Shipmates\\" was used in the 2003 historical epic Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World. The movie's director Peter Weir was looking for an authentic British Navy song from 1805 when he discovered Mageean's version of the song from his 1978 album Of Ships... and Men.
