In its heyday, it was one of the best known benefit societies.Alvin J. Schmidt Fraternal Orders (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press), 1980, p.35  History  The organization was founded on December 18, 1878, in Boston, Massachusetts, by Dr. Darius Wilson and nine others.Stevens, Albert Clark, 1854- The Cyclop√¶dia of Fraternities: A Compilation of Existing Authentic Information and the Results of Original Investigation as to More than Six Hundred Secret Societies in the United States (New York: Hamilton Printing and Publishing Company), 1899, p.123 Some of the founders had participated in the founding of the Royal Arcanum and Dr. Wilson was also connected with the Knights of HonorStevens p.123 and was reportedly a members of the Ancient Order of United Workmen.Schmidt p.35  Membership and benefits  Membership was open to white men and women eighteen to fifty years of age. Originally the upper age limit was sixty four, but this was reduced in 1885. There were initiation ceremonies but, if the candidate objected, these could be dispensed with and a formal obligation could be taken at any time and place. The order had a three tier structure: local units were called \\"Subordinate Councils\\"; above them were the \\"Grand\\" or \\"State Councils\\"; representatives of the latter and all living Past Supreme Commanders made up the \\"Supreme Council\\".Stevens p.123 The order issued certificates of $1000, $2000 or $3000 each, at their option, and those certificates carried a \\"graduate weekly benefit.\\"Stevens p.123 The Legion reached its membership high point at the end of 1889 with 62,457. Like many fraternal organizations, the Legion ran into financial difficulties in 1895 and 1896. These were caused by a number of factors, including the Panic of 1896, an increased death rate, increased expenses and debts, \\"unusually high\\" assessments in 1896 and a lack of new members. The total membership on December 31, 1895, was 53,210o; a year later it was 36,028.Stevens p.124 Like many fraternal orders of its time the American Legion of Honor was based on inadequate rates that eventually led to bankruptcy. While the organization was successful in the early years, as the mortality of its membership increased, the order could no longer pay promised benefits as fewer people joined and others withdrew. (This phenomenon is known in insurance jargon as \\"adverse selection\\", as sicker persons retain their memberships and younger, healthier persons fail to join in adequate numbers to offset the claims paid out.) In 1903, for instance, only 51 members joined, bringing in $755,000, however 2,004 members either died or withdrew taking over $3 million with them. The order went into receivership in August 1904.The Review Aug. 25, 1904 Vol. XI #32 pp.504-6  Other \\"Legions of Honor\\"  There were two groups related to the ALH, though their precise relationship with each other is unclear. = Iowa Legion of Honor = The Iowa Legion of Honor was founded in 1878 and, as the name implied, was designed for the residents of the state of Iowa (though members who left the state could keep their membership). This group was open to men and women, though in separate divisions, and members lives could be insured for $1000 or $2000. There were only two levels of organizations, the \\"Subordinate Lodges\\" and the \\"Grand Lodge\\", which met biennially. The founders of the Iowa Legion of Honor stated that they \\"were not members of any particular organization of like nature\\". There were 7,500 members in 1896.Stevens pp.124, 141 By 1905 membership was down to 4,300 and the group went out of existence some time after 1910.Schmidt p.168 = Northwest Legion of Honor = The Northwest Legion of Honor was incorporated in the state of Iowa on March 12, 1884. Unlike the Iowa Legion of Honor, this order extended its jurisdiction to the Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas and Minnesota, as well as Iowa. Membership was open to acceptable white persons eighteen to fifty years of age, who were not engaged in an extra-hazardous profession. Like the ILH it had only Subordinate Councils and a Grand Council. It had a ritual that taught benevolence and its motto was \\"We Work Together\\". Its total membership in 1896 was 2,500. The NLH \\"frankly admit[ed]\\" to being an \\"offspring\\" of the American Legion of Honor Stevens pp.170-1 The Northwest Legion of Honor offered insurance certificates of $500, $1000, $2000 and $3,000. Assessments were graded by age, and one fifth was set aside for a fund to be used in the case of an epidemic or other increase in the death rate.Stevens p.171  References   See also  *List of North American fraternal benefit orders Category:Fraternal orders Category:Organizations established in 1878 Category:Organizations disestablished in 1904 Category:1878 establishments in Massachusetts ","title":"American Legion of Honor"},{"id":"40236231","text":"PirateBrowser is an Internet browser by The Pirate Bay used to circumvent Internet censorship.

The Parish of St. Vincent de Paul was a national parish of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. Founded in 1841, it was dedicated to serve the needs of the French-speaking population of the city. The parish church was located at 123 West 23rd Street, New York, New York. The parish was closed in January 2013. History =Origins= Abb√© Jean-Baptiste Rauzan, the founder of the Fathers of Mercy The Roman Catholic Church in France had been devastated by the social upheavals of the French Revolution. Much of the population was in deep economic misery, and the level of religious knowledge, after the destruction of church institutions which had been built up over centuries, was dismal. A strong need was felt for a re- evangelization of the nation. In 1808 the Society of the Fathers of Mercy were founded by the Abb√© Jean-Baptiste Rauzan in Lyons in response to this need. They formed bands of Catholic priests who would go from door to door, if needed, to invite people to the parish missions which they would preach. Through these, they worked to give the French people knowledge and help them commit to their traditional Catholic faith. Given their experience in working with populations who had lost touch with the institutions of the Catholic faith, several Catholic bishops in the United States invited the members of the society to come as missionaries to the nation, then a vast mission territory. In October 1839, one of the founders of the Society, Charles Auguste Marie Joseph, Count of Forbin-Janson, the exiled Bishop of Nancy in France, arrived in New York City to start a nationwide preaching tour for which he had been authorized by Pope Gregory XVI. Finding no place of worship for the French-speaking people of the city, he learned that the French- speaking population was starting to attend services in the Protestant Huguenot churches, as they were conducted in French. In his sermon in French in a Mass he celebrated at St. Peter's Church, he challenged the French Catholic community of the city to establish a French-speaking church. (Prior to 1964 all Western rite Catholic masses were said exclusively in Latin, only the sermon and announcements were in a vernacular language, for example French or English) To help in the endeavor, he contributed $6,500 from his own vast wealth to start the construction of the church. Property was acquired on the northwest corner of Canal Street and Broadway. Forbin-Janson returned to the city on various occasions during his mission to check on the progress of the building. Meanwhile, with the help of another significant donation from his personal funds, the Fathers of Mercy acquired the newly founded Spring Hill College from the Diocese of Mobile in Alabama. With this, the Society established itself in the United States. =The parish= Two years later, John Hughes, the Archbishop of New York, invited these priests to come from Alabama to his diocese to serve the French-speaking immigrants who were flocking to the city, in the church built by the French bishop. The parish was opened in 1841, with the church being dedicated by Forbin-Janson before he sailed back to France on December 8 of that year. The first pastor appointed by Hughes was the Rev. Annet Lafont, S.P.M. Lafont was an energetic and dedicated pastor. In addition to his parochial duties, he founded the Orphanage of St. Vincent de Paul, with sites in both New York City and Tarrytown, as well as homes for the elderly and residences for the young single women who came to the city seeking work. What is now known as Manhattan College developed from his parish school, through his bringing the first Brothers of the Christian Schools from France to teach in the United States/ Lafont was also a strong supporter of the rights of the African-American community of the city, who suffered discrimination even from the few Catholic churches then open. Services at the Church of St. Vincent de Paul were integrated from the start, as was the parish school, the first in the Northern States to teach students regardless of race. When the European families threatened to withdraw their children from the school as a result of his policies, Lafont brought the black children into his own residence to teach them himself. In this he had the financial support of Pierre Toussaint. He was a native of Haiti who had been brought to the United States as a slave and had amassed great wealth as a hairdresser. He used his wealth for education and philanthropy, and he is now being considered for canonization by the Catholic Church. Lafont also organized the St. Ann Society, the first mission to African Americans in New York. Through the society, the families were given weekly religious instruction classes in the basement of the church. =Chelsea= Around 1856 the parish made the decision to move to the Chelsea neighborhood of the city, where many French residents had settled, drawn there by the developing industrialization in the area. Property was acquired and Henry Engelbert was commissioned to build a new church. The construction was interrupted by the Civil War, but the new church was completed and dedicated in 1869. The presence of the church helped to establish the neighborhood as a hub of French presence in the city, drawing a number of institutions to the area, such as the former French Hospital. In 1910 a large bequest was left to the parish to build the Church of Notre Dame, located in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of the borough, in order to promote devotion to Our Lady of Lourdes. The new church was a mission church of the parish. After World War I, the Memorial to French and American Veterans was built in the church in memory of the members of the Lafayette Squadron and other Americans who had died fighting for France. On June 6, 1944 more than one thousand French exiles and French soldiers attended the noon mass at St. Vincent de Paul Church NYC to pray for victory as Allied troops began the liberation of France from Nazi occupation. Photographs of the D-Day noon mass at St. Vincent de Paul and the many French exiles and French soldiers who attended the mass may be viewed at Flashbak.com Photos Of New Yorkers After Learning About The D-Day Invasion ‚Äì June 6, 1944 https://flashbak.com/photos-of-new-yorkers-after-learning-about- the-d-day-invasion-june-6-1944-381282/ The church was re-dedicated after World War II, with President Charles de Gaulle of France present. =Later years and closure= The boarded-up church in 2017 The Fathers of Mercy withdrew from the parish in 1960, transferring administration to the Archdiocese of New York. The parish has maintained a weekly Mass in French since its founding, serving an array of immigrants to the city from various French-speaking countries of the world, representing some 65 nations. Since the late 20th century, most of these immigrants have been from Western African nations. In 2007, however, the Archdiocese of New York began to express an interest in closing the parish. In 2006, preservationists and others who wished to preserve the church applied for landmark status for the church, seeking to protect it from redevelopment. The group organized as a nonprofit group, Save St. Vincent de Paul. The effort received the support of President Nicolas Sarkozy of France wrote directly to both Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, the Archbishop of New York and to Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York City, to express the French's government's interest in preserving the church. Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, publicly supported the application.Letter Re: St. Vincent de Paul Church from Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried to Robert Tierney, Chair, Landmarks Preservation Commission (September 23, 2009). However, by 2012 the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission determined that the application did not merit a formal public hearing, with a spokeswoman saying: \\"Our decision not to recommend its designation to the full commission was based on a careful review of the building's architectural and historical qualities. We found that the existing facade, a neo-Classical facade that replaced the original Romanesque Revival facade in 1939, was designed by a little-known architect and lacked architectural distinction.\\" In August 2011, stormwater from Tropical Storm Irene breached the church's roof; because of the planned closure, the Archdiocese of New York did not repair the damage to the church, prompting a renewed preservationist push. The church closed in 2013, although former parishioners, many Francophone, retain an attachment to the church building.Samantha Schmidt, After Explosion, Chelsea's 23rd Street Slowly Comes Back to Life, New York Times (September 20, 2016). Parishioners unsuccessfully challenged the Archdiocese of New York's decision to close the church through the Catholic Church's canon law system. In January 2016, the Apostolic Signatura in Rome, the highest Vatican court, issued its final decision declining to consider the parishioners' appeal.Melanie Grayce West, Battle to Save New York's St. Vincent de Paul Ends in Rome, Wall Street Journal (February 7, 2016). The church sustained damage in a bombing on 23rd Street in September 2016; \\"its center rose-shaped, stained-glass window was blown out and two other stained-glass panels were damaged\\" in the explosion. Notable events St. Vincent de Paul Parish has served as a center of French culture since its founding. In addition to providing social services to immigrants from both Europe and Africa, it has been a notable cultural center for the French-speaking. Examples are: *The Funeral Mass of the famed French opera singer, Armand Castelmary (1834-1897), who had died onstage at the Metropolitan Opera House on February 10, 1897; *The funeral of Louis Keller, the publisher of the New York Social Register, in February 1922; *The wedding of Edith Piaf, with Marlene Dietrich as her maid of honor, on September 20, 1952.

Distribution and habitat Viburnum australe is native to the Sierra Madre Oriental in the Mexican states of Coahuila and Nuevo L√©on. It also occurs in the United States in the Davis Mountains of Texas. V. australe inhabits mesic pine-oak forests above .Muller, C. H. (1939). Relations of the vegetation and climatic types in Nuevo Leon, Mexico. American Midland Naturalist, 687-729., accessed 08.13.2013. Taxonomy and evolution The generic name originated in Latin, where it referred to V. lantana. The specific epithet australe is derived from Latin australis, meaning \\"southern\\" (c.f. Australia). Viburnum australe was described as a separate species by Conrad Vernon Morton in 1933, from a specimen collected in 1906 by Cyrus Guernsey Pringle. Subsequent taxonomists subsumed V. australe into Viburnum affine C.K.Schneid., which is itself considered a midwestern variety of Viburnum rafinesqueanum Schult.Estes, D. (2010). Viburnum bracteatum (Adoxaceae) expanded to include Viburnum ozarkense. Castanea, 75(2), 277-293., doi:10.2179/08-062.1. However, recent molecular phylogenetic work has revealed that V. australe is actually more closely related to V. ellipticum, from the Pacific Coast Ranges of the western United States, than it is to V. rafinesqueanum.Clement, W. L., & Donoghue, M. J. (2012). Barcoding success as a function of phylogenetic relatedness in Viburnum, a clade of woody angiosperms. BMC Evolutionary Biology, 12(1), 73., doi:10.1186/1471-2148-12-73. V. australe would therefore be considered a distinct species under the phylogenetic species concept. Viburnum australe and V. ellipticum are closely related to three species from eastern North America: V. rafinesqueanum, V. molle, and the endangered V. bracteatum. These species, known as clade Mollodontotinus, are in turn more distantly related to the arrowwood species complex and its Neotropical relatives in clade Oreinodontotinus.Clement, W. L., & Donoghue, M. J. (2011). Dissolution of Viburnum section Megalotinus (Adoxaceae) of Southeast Asia and its implications for morphological evolution and biogeography. International Journal of Plant Sciences, 172(4), 559-573., doi:. Conservation Viburnum australe is considered to be a rare species in the United States, where it is known from a single locality near the town of Madera Springs, Texas.Powell, A. M. (1998). Trees and shrubs of the Trans-Pecos and adjacent areas. University of Texas Press., page 386. Like other species in clades Mollodontotinus and Oreinodontotinus, Viburnum australe is vulnerable to Pyrrhalta viburni, an invasive Eurasian leaf beetle. North American Viburnum, which did not coevolve with P. viburni, lack the physiological defenses that allow its Eurasian relatives to fend off beetle infestations, and have therefore been decimated in areas where P. viburni has become established.Desurmont, G. A., Donoghue, M. J., Clement, W. L., & Agrawal, A. A. (2011). Evolutionary history predicts plant defense against an invasive pest.

The film is produced by Illuminati Films‚ÄòHappy Ending‚Äô for Kareena Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan? The Times of India. 12 August 2013 and stars Saif Ali Khan, Ileana D'Cruz and Govinda in the lead roles. The theatrical trailer launched on 10 October 2014. Plot Writer Yudi (Saif Ali Khan) wrote a hit book five and a half years ago but he is still living life king- size in Los Angeles, enjoying fame and affairs, avoiding commitment, doing no work, partying with his miserably married friend Montu (Ranvir Shorey) or having conversations with his fat, bearded inner voice brother Yogi (also Saif). Suddenly, Yudi's money runs out and his publishers dump him for hit romance novelist Aanchal (Ileana D'Cruz), visiting from Mumbai. The only work Yudi now gets is from Bollywood single-screen superstar Armaan (Govinda) who insists he copies Hollywood movies and writes a multiplex-style romedy (romance & comedy). Meanwhile, Yudi's dentist and once-girlfriend Vishakha (Kalki Koechlin) is pursuing him obsessively, even loading videos of him singing in the shower on her laptop, forcing Yudi and Montu to break into her home when she's away. On top of this, Yudi's got severe writer's block, stopping him from finishing any work. Running away from it all, Yudi tries to charm Aanchal but she's commitment-averse too. However, she gradually warms up to him, escorting him to Armaan's party, trying to help Yudi write, even agreeing to take a road trip with him to her book reading in San Francisco. The duo has fun singing classic Bollywood numbers on the way until doziness overtakes them and their car skids. While they wait for the repair van, Yudi and Aanchal have a ball posing in provocative ways on the highway in search of lifts. Eventually reaching San Francisco, the couple is forced to share a hotel room ‚Äì and agreeing to keep it simple and commitment-free, they end up making love. Their relationship grows funnier ‚Äì on Aanchal's last night in LA, they argue over dinner, Yudi throws her phone into a vase while she douses him with water ‚Äì but neither expresses anything more than a sense of light fun. It's only when Yudi's ex Divya (Priety Zinta in a cameo), having argued with her husband and visiting Yudi with her kids, tells him he loves Aanchal that he admits it to himself. Yudi then races Aanchal's taxi to the airport in a hilarious scene and tells her his feelings, but she expresses her wish to remain friends with him. As she leaves, Yudi is sunk in depression, and then starts to write. Along the way, Vishakha gets engaged to a panic-stricken Yudi by falsely claiming she's pregnant ‚Äì but then breaks it up, saying she doesn't want him to marry her out of pity. Armaan, who has meanwhile got himself cosmetic surgery and six-pack abs in LA, is impressed with the 'kick-ass' script Yudi presents him. However, for the script's ending, Yudi goes to Mumbai and sees Aanchal where he tells her they can take it one day at a time ‚Äì and perhaps live their whole lives together like that. Aanchal smiles and the Happy Ending begins.

This group, a number of whom were Freemasons and Oddfellows launched the OCF in Indianapolis, Indiana on May 28, 1879. Like most fraternal societies of the day, the original Order had a secret ritual and was organized in the typical three tiered structure of local \\"Councils\\", statewide \\"Grand Councils\\" and a national \\"Supreme Council\\". Before the schisms occurred it had 12,000 members.Alvin J. Schmidt Fraternal Orders (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press), 1930, pp.71-72 In 1881 the Order of United Friends split from the OCF in New York State over disagreements in insurance practices. The United Friends of Michigan left in 1889 and the Canadian Order of Chosen Friends was formed in Ontario in 1891. Lastly, German speaking members left to form the United League of America in 1895. In spite of all this the group was able to rebound and had 32,255 members in 1899. However, adverse publicity about the organizations financial difficulties finally spelled the end of the Order in the early twentieth century.Schmidt p.72 = Order of United Friends = Incorporated in the state of New York in 1881, the O.U.F. was open to men and women and paid death and disability benefits.

It had approximately 20,000 members in the late 1890s.Stevens p.184 = Independent Order of Chosen Friends = The Independent Order of Chosen Friends was founded in early 1882 when leaders of the O.C.F. in California petitioned the Supreme Council for the creation of a Pacific Jurisdiction. When this was refused there was a secession and the Independent Order of Chosen Friends was created.

The Canadian affiliates left the OCF when many members became dissatisfied with the parent order. For several years there was considerable litigation between the two over the use of the name \\"Chosen Friends\\" and because of financial matters. The Order established a sickness department in 1890 and a child insurance department in 1917. It made \\"very necessary actuarial adjustments\\" in 1915, which, nevertheless, resulted in a significant decrease in membership. However, by the early 1920s the Order had rebounded again and had 32,000 members. In 1943 the Order became the Reliable Life Insurance Society.

History In the first half of the 18th century, the folwark of Mereczowszczyzna belonged to the Sapieha family, and until the Partitions of Poland, was part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania‚Äôs Brest Litovsk Voivodeship. In 1733, the village became property of Ludwik Tadeusz Kosciuszko, who lived here until 1764. On February 4, 1746, Tadeusz Kosciuszko was born here, in a manor house. After the third partition of Poland (1795), the village came under control of the Russian Empire, where it remained until 1916. From 1918 to 1939, it belonged to the Second Polish Republic. In September 1939, it was occupied by the Soviet Union during the Soviet invasion of Poland in World War II, and annexed to Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1941, it was occupied by Nazi Germany. In 1942, the house in which Kosciuszko was born and spent the first 12 years of his life was burned down by Soviet partisans. After the war, the village remained in the Soviet Union. Ko≈õciuszko museum In 2003, with financial support of the U.S. Embassy in Minsk, reconstruction of the house was started. Since several photos and drawings of the complex were preserved, the work was completed in a year. The house, based on the 18th century foundations, was opened for the public in 2004.

Resultantly, many New Zealand women who might otherwise have been sentenced to penal servitude or capital punishment in New Zealand had their sentences commuted to the lesser charge of \\"concealment of birth\\" under the Offences Against the Person Act 1867. However, this relative leniency only extended to mothers of concealed or hidden infants who subsequently died. Fathers, grandparents and \\"baby farmers\\" like Minnie Dean, the only woman to be executed in New Zealand history and Daniel Cooper in the 1920s, were viewed as more culpable for the death of such infants. Background: Infant Mortality in late 19th-century New Zealand In a recent volume on childbirth, pregnancy, infant mortality and infanticide in 19th-century New Zealand, Alison Clarke \\"She has no Baby Now to Call Her Mother: Infant Death\\" in A.Clarke: Born to a Changing World: Childbirth in Nineteenth Century New Zealand: Wellington: Bridget Williams Books: 2012 places the deaths of newborn infants in colonial era 19th-century New Zealand in historical context. Over the four decades (1861-1899) for which statistical evidence is available, an estimated cumulative 53,000 such infants perished in New Zealand. Early New Zealand colonial statistics show that from 1872 onwards, more than 1,000 infants or small toddlers died each year from maladies and environmental factors summarised below, peaking at 1,995 such fatalities in 1883, although in 1872 (1,941 deaths), 1875 (1,816 deaths), 1886 (1,889 deaths), and 1899 (1,806 deaths), more than 1,800 infants died.Statistics of the Colony of New Zealand: 1861-1899: Wellington: Government Printing Office: 1899 If the afflicted child was less than one month old at their time of death, there may have been premature birth. Without the complex life support technology available in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, this would often prove fatal due to the lack of sufficient infant respiratory development.Alison Clarke: Born to a Changing World: Childbirth in Nineteenth Century New Zealand: Wellington: Bridget Williams Books: 2012 Other than that, newborn infants might also perish from sharing beds with their parents, who might roll over and smother them inadvertently during sleep; negligent parental alcohol abuse and impaired standards of care; administration of alcohol to prevent infant cries; and the associated use of soporific drugs such as laudanum and chlorodyne. In the case of prostitutes and single pregnant women, sexually transmitted diseases might be passed on to their newborn infants during prenatal development, while inadequately warm clothing might affect mortality for the newborn infants of the poor. Infant malnutrition might occur due to lack of awareness of the benefits of breastfeeding for infants, as well as the absence of medical treatment for conditions such as bronchitis, pneumonia, influenza, whooping cough, diphtheria, diarrhoea, enteritis, gastritis, ileus, inherited syphilis and tuberculosis. Maori Infanticide? Cautionary notes In the case of Maori infants, detailed statistics about infant health and mortality are not as readily available, due to their presence in remote and isolated rural dwellings inaccessible through roading and civic transport. Furthermore, there are social policy considerations that need to be considered, as British colonialism distorted social relationships that may have either hampered or facilitated infanticide in the Maori context.Ian Pool: Te Iwi Maori: A New Zealand Population: Past, Present and Projected: Auckland: Auckland University Press: 1991: 47, 100 Given the ravages of higher incidence of poor housing, sanitation, malnutrition and infectious diseases, overall 19th-century Maori infant mortality was probably higher than those of European counterparts, however. Against infanticide, however, large family (whanau) structures were often available to care for any such child. While there are accounts of apparent infanticide, they often seem to be second-hand information from pakeha Church of England missionaries. These noted that female infanticide seemed to be prevalent in the context of slavery, cross-cultural relationships and other such inhospitable grounds. Intertribal warfare was also a factor that militated against female infant survival, given the prospect that surviving male children could then become warriors for the defence of a particular iwi (tribal community and social network). However, it is highly probable that the advent of colonialism and introduction of European transport and weapons technology affected the severity and scale of prior tribal conflicts, so this may not reflect an accurate prognosis of Maori infanticide. As time went on, many Maori adopted Christian religious beliefs due to missionary efforts and this reduced the incidence of slavery, cannibalism and homicide amongst such Maori communities, although it also returned even during the early 20th century during times of economic hardship. In short, it is hard to assess the frequency and prevalence of Maori infanticide and its permissibility during the 19th century. Legal context Altogether, Clarke identifies 98 cases of deliberate or intentional infant death that resulted in legal proceedings. Of these, 94 were undertaken against the mother of the deceased infant, while fourteen of these were also undertaken against the baby's father, grandparents or friends of the mother who had assisted in the birth and its concealment. Four involved the father of the deceased infant and another individual, often a grandparent. Usually, if the birth had been concealed, the maximum penalty was two years imprisonment, and as Bronwyn Dalley notes, women could often plead mitigating circumstances through male sexual coercion (a \\"seduction\\" narrative), although this was not always successful. Some women were convicted of infanticide or manslaughter in this context, although many others were acquitted. Men could not similarly plead \\"seduction\\" or the trauma of unassisted childbirth in this context; as witnessed by the case of William Henry Woodgate, who committed incest with his niece that subsequently resulted in her pregnancy and childbirth, leading to the killing of the newborn and his subsequent execution for murder in 1877. Originally, concealment arose in 17th century Anglo-Scottish law and sought to punish secret illegitimate pregnancies and childbirths in which mothers hid the bodies of the infants after birth or stillbirth. As noted above, not all mothers were successful in pleading concealment- the cases of Phoebe Veitch and Sarah-Jane and Anna Flannagan stand out as exceptions to this general rule, although the defense was usually effective when it came to mitigated imprisonment or even acquittal, in some circumstances. Throughout the British Empire in the 1890s, concern arose over the negligent standards of \\"care\\" offered by baby farmers. Minnie Dean and others may have been viewed as equivalents to John and Sarah Makin and Frances Lydia Alice Knorr in adjacent New South Wales in Australia, or Amelia Dyer in the United Kingdom, who were her historical contemporaries. Such trials also built up a volume of relevant case law within imperial jurisdictions. History In 1869, Annie Bates had been domestic servant for a Greymouth merchant and his family on the South Island's West Coast. Her employer, William Coates, spotted the body of a newborn infant in the lavatory, with the subsequent revelation of the decomposed body of a female infant. Bates confessed to the apparent concealment of the infant when she was apprehended, but held that it had been stillborn when she gave birth alongside the Grey River adjacent to the town. Mary Ann Swift, a dancer at the Greenstone Pub, argued that had not been the case when she appeared as witness for the prosecution in this case, but her opinion was dismissed. She was found not guilty of either murder, manslaughter or concealment by the subsequent jury when the case came to trial.West Coast Times: 14.01.1870 In the case of Mary Ann Spendlove, concealment was judged to have occurred and she was acquitted of murder in 1866, and subsequently sentenced to two years imprisonment on the lesser charge. Spendlove had cast her baby's body adrift in Nelson Harbour in 1865. The infant had been conceived during an extramarital affair while her husband was absent. She claimed that the infant was premature, but medical examination demonstrated that it was, in fact, a fully developed infant, had been born alive and died of suffocation. Alison Clark argues that one of the reasons that she was not treated as leniently as some of the other women cited in this section was that as a married woman, Spendlove \\"should have known better.\\"Nelson Examiner: 07.02.1872 From Galway in Ireland, Bridget Gee (1845-?) was initially described as a \\"good industrious girl and of a kind disposition\\" by her employer, Mrs Elizabeth Aikman, while employed as a maidservant at Dunedin's Glasgow Hotel. However, in June 1871, she gave birth and then concealed the body of her newborn infant beneath her mattress. Although she claimed that the death of the infant was accidental, the infant had suffered concussion to the head, fractures and lost blood through laceration, possibly caused by scissors or a stay. Although Gee was not found guilty of manslaughter or murder, she was found guilty of concealment. Her lawyer, Robert Stout, claimed that the injuries to the dead infant were likely to have been accidental, and the Crown Prosecutor, Bryan Haggit, concurred. Gee was suspected of brutally killing her child and was not acquitted of concealment, however.Otago Witness: 23.09.1871 Similarly, Margaret Collins (1854-?) was illiterate and had no family available in New Zealand to assist her covert pregnancy and childbirth, thus leading to her slashing her newborn baby's throat and hiding the body under her mattress in Milton in 1875. However, she was found guilty of manslaughter, given the nature of her infant's fatal injuries, although only sentenced to two months imprisonment.Evening Star: 15.04.1875 In 1884, Auckland mother Rosina Smith initially fostered out her newborn infant, but then absconded with the two-month-old baby, before burying him in a market garden in Parnell, an Auckland suburb. The presiding judge in that case, Chief Justice James Prendergast, suggested three options to the jurors- they could either find Smith guilty of murder, manslaughter or insanity. The jury found the latter verdict was the case, although this was an unusual outcome, as courts usually did not find that mothers were mentally ill when they killed their newborn babies in this context New Zealand Herald: 08.10.1884 However, at least three other women may have had diagnosable mental health concerns by current medical standards, given Clarke's assessment of newspaper accounts and court documents. In 1878, Margaret Wilson gave birth to a daughter at Timaru's Benevolent Society, an emergency housing facility for indigent women, their infants and children, but the baby only survived for three months before it was strangled. When Wilson appeared before the New Zealand Supreme Court, it was apparent that she was unfit to face charges of murder in the context of her daughter's death. She was admitted to the Sunnyside Hospital in Christchurch and custodial staff testified that she was unable to comprehend what was said to her, was violent and had to be restrained.Timaru Herald: 15.06.1878 Fanny Bonnington (1868-?) was a Blenheim domestic servant who gave birth at sixteen in secret in 1884, and threw the dead body of her infant down an ablutionary facility. Postmortem medical investigation revealed that it had been alive at its birth and had several superficial scratch wounds on its trunk, and cause of death was determined to be haemorrhaging from the umbilical cord. Doctor Thomas Porter noted that Bonnington appeared to be experiencing what might be defined today as post-partum depression, as had one of the defendant's sisters after her pregnancy and childbirth. Her grandfather also experienced what might be diagnosed as Alzheimer's disease in contemporary medical practise. Bonnington was found not guilty of concealment through reason of insanity at the time of birth and although held for three months doing kitchen work at the Wellington Lunatic Asylum, she was subsequently released and returned to Blenheim. Justice William Richmond commented that in such instances, judges and juries were often swayed by the 'seduction narrative' and held the man who had impregnated such women more culpable than the \\"abandoned\\" and isolated single women who gave often traumatic birth without the attendance of family or doctors in the new colony, so they would not convict a young woman of infanticide, murder or manslaughter in this context.Marlborough Express: 21.10.1884 Margaret Heads/Edwards was servant to a Dunedin bank clerk and his family. In 1889, while boarding with a labourer's wife, this young woman gave birth and concealed the body of the infant in that woman's wardrobe. It was unclear whether the infant had been born alive or not in this instance and she was acquitted of concealment of birth. She had been \\"seduced\\" and then had been left indigent. As with Bonnington's case, a Tuapeka Times journalist referred to Heads/Edward's 'seduction\\" and argued that the man who had abandoned her was \\"truly\\" responsible for this tragedy.Tuapeka Times: 31.08.1889 Sometimes, however, the balance of evidence pointed otherwise. In 1881, Dunedin coroner Thomas Morland Hocken advised against keeping an infant in bed with its parents, as there could be problems with respiratory distress if the sleeping parents rolled over and inadvertently suffocated the baby in question. However, in the case of Mary Ann Weston, there were grounds to suspect that the death of the infant may have been deliberate, as Dunedin's Industrial School orphanage had taken her two earlier children into custodial care, and Weston was drinking heavily. The coronial inquest jury found Weston had a manslaughter case to answer, but Weston was later acquitted of manslaughter in the Dunedin Supreme Court.Otago Witness: 31 December 1881: 10 January 1882 Popular perceptions In 1895, Edward Tregear, a civil servant and local intellectual, suggested to Wellington's Evening Post newspaper that New Zealand society was responsible for the spate of infanticides in recent years of colonial history. He was referring to the contemporary case of Mary Davis (1889), in which that Wellington domestic servant had given birth secretly, and as with Margaret Heads/Edwards had concealed the baby's body in her wardrobe. Davis had tied but not cut the infant's umbilical cord, and was acquitted of both murder and concealment of birth in the local Magistrate's Court. Tregear advocated for parenting education in this contextE.Tregear: Letters to the Editor: Evening Post: 29.10.1895; 13.11.1895; 18.11.1895; 19.11.1895 See also *Minnie Dean *Phoebe Veitch *Caroline Whitting *Lillian Fanny Jane Hobbs *Winifred Carrick *Sarah-Jane and Anna Flannagan *Capital punishment in New Zealand *John and Sarah Makin *Frances Lydia Alice Knorr *Amelia Dyer References Further reading *Alison Clarke: Born to A Changing World: Childbirth in Nineteenth Century New Zealand: Wellington: Bridget Williams Books: 2012. *Bronwyn Dalley: \\"Criminal Conversations: Infanticide, Gender and Sexuality in Nineteenth Century New Zealand\\" in Caroline Daley and Deborah Montgomerie (eds) The Gendered Kiwi: Auckland: Auckland University Press: 2000. *Lynley Hood: Minnie Dean: Her Life and Crimes: Penguin: Auckland: 1994. *Mark Jackson (ed) Infanticide: Historical Perspectives on Child Murder and Concealment: 1550-2000: Ashgate: Aldershot: 2002. *Jan Kociumbas: \\"Azaria's Antecedents: Stereotyping Infanticide in Nineteenth Century Australia:\\" Gender and History: 13: 2001: 138-160. *Hilary Marland: Dangerous Motherhood?

Other villages in Tiruppuvanam Taluk are Tiruppuvanam, Achangulam, Allinagaram, Chellapanendal, Ilandaikulam, K.Pethanendal Reason for the Name Piramanoor: Lord Bramha came here to worship the Linga brought by him from the Kailasa Mountain. As per his request, the place is called as Piramanoor(Brahman+Oor). This Shiva temple is near Tiruppuvanam in Sivaganga district, Tamil Nadu, India. This shrine is in the Pandya region of Tamil Nadu.  Mythology  The lingam worshiped here was brought by the Lord Bramha from Mount Kailash. Festivals Thiru Karthikai: In the Tamil month of Karthikai, on Thirukarthikai day the Thalam tree is planted and put in to fire (Chokkappan). Special Pooja is done on every Pradosam day. Temple structure The Temple spans an area of about 78 Cents. There are several shrines within this temple complex. The Shiva and Ambal shrines both face the East. The presiding deity Lord Shiva is called as Kailasha Nathar and the Parvathy is called as Kamatchi Ambiga. Other Deities - Lord Ganapathy, Lord Subramani, Lord Vishnu, Navagraham, Lord Suriyan (Sun), Lord Chandran (Moon) and Lord Viaravan. Location Near by Towns - Tiruppuvanam (5 km), Madurai (23 km), Sivaganga (24.3 km), Manamadurai(25.2 km), Kalaiyarkoil (41.4 km), Singampunari (43.6 km).90 km from Madurai. The nearest town Aruppukottai is about 15 km away from this temple. History Lord Bramha and Lord Vishnu had a cross fire between them regarding who is most powerful among them. At that time Lord Shiva appears as fire of mountain. Suddenly an oracle is heard \\"Who is doing quick darshan of Patham (foot) or Sirasu (head) will be the powerful.\\" Immediately God Vishnu takes Varaha (Pig) Avathar and started piercing the earth to see the foot of Lord Shiva. Lord Brahma takes Anna (Swan) avatar and started to fly in the sky to view the head of Lord Shiva. Both could not succeed. Meanwhile, Brahma meets Talampu flower (Screw Pine Flower)which is on the way down from the head of Lord Shiva . Brahma insists Talampu to say a lie, that he (Lord Bramha) has seen the head of Lord Shiva. After much effort, Lord Vishnu realizes and accepts his failure to see Lord Shiva's foot and surrenders to Lord Shiva. But Lord Bramha says that he has seen Lord Shiva's head and brings Talampu (Screw Pine Flower) as witness. Lord Shiva gets angry and curses Bramha and Talampu. So, there is no idol worshiping of Bramha in temples. And Talampu is not used for Shiva poojas. Salvation (Saba Vimosanam) Lord Bramha asked Lord Shiva for Salvation - Lord Shiva asks Lord Bramha to go to Pulokam (Earth) and worship him and also says that Talampu (Screw pine flower) should not be used in Shiva Pooja. Lord Bramha goes to Mount Kailas, meets Lord Shiva and Parvathy, brings Linga from Mount Kailas to Pulokam (Earth) and worships. The place of worship of Linga by Brahma is called as PIRAMANOOR (Bramhan+Oor). Temple's Speciality Poojas are done twice daily and special poojas on Pradhosam days. During Karthikai month on Thirukarthikai day, Tala tree is planted in the middle and burned - Chokkappanai.

The episode aired on August 19, 2013. Commentators gave the episode mixed reviews, though most applauded Natalie Zea's role as Maxine. Upon airing, the episode was watched by 10.64 million viewers, and received an 18-49 rating of 2.4 Plot Julia (Rachelle Lefevre) takes Barbie (Mike Vogel) to see the mini-dome and the egg, but they have both disappeared. Barbie then leaves to help Linda (Natalie Martinez) break up some fights, where they find a highly strung out drug addict who is undergoing withdrawal symptoms from Rapture, a drug that he had purchased from Reverend Coggins (Ned Bellamy). A thorough search by Linda and Barbie uncovers drug making equipment in one of Reverend Coggin's coffins. Big Jim receives an unexpected visitor ‚Äì Maxine (Natalie Zea), a business partner who created Rapture. She was trapped under the dome because she had decided to pay Big Jim a visit on the day the dome fell over Chester's Mill. Big Jim suggests to Linda that they encourage the town's residents to voluntarily hand in their weapons, so as to protect everybody's safety. Linda and Barbie are skeptical of Big Jim's intentions, but decide to go along with his idea to keep everybody safe. While the guns are getting collected, a local named Ted (Raheen Babalola) begins to concern Big Jim. He and Barbie follow him to his house, with Barbie waiting outside with a sniper rifle while Big Jim goes in the house. Big Jim finds Ted in his room, where he reveals a grenade, saying that he can't live after the dome killed his family. Big Jim then grabs the grenade and puts the pin back into it. He takes Ted away from the house, and tells Barbie he knows that he was aiming for him with the sniper. Big Jim and Maxine later meet up with the guns, with Barbie walking in and Maxine kissing him. Maxine then reveals that she knows all about both their secrets and will expose them if they try to stop her from doing what she wants. It is then revealed that she requested having the guns gathered. Later that night, Junior (Alexander Koch) finds the shelter at the house open, and sees Big Jim organizing a number of guns and the grenade from earlier in one of the rooms. Angie (Britt Robertson) takes over the diner, and asks Big Jim to put her name on the diner's deed. Big Jim promises to think about it. Junior pays a visit to Angie at the diner and she goes into a seizure, repeating the phrase, \\"The pink stars are falling.\\" Junior brings Angie back home, where she finds out that she had the same seizure as Joe (Colin Ford) and Norrie (Mackenzie Lintz). Norrie notices Angie's butterfly tattoo and wonders if she is the \\"monarch who will be crowned.\\" Norrie suggests using the yagee, an invention by Dodee (Jolene Purdy) to find the missing mini-dome. Julia tries to borrow it from Dodee but she says that the yagee isn't working anymore because Joe and Norrie touched the dome together. Joe, Norrie, and Angie later find the dome in the barn, with Angie saying that she saw Joe sleepwalking, and they assume that he brought it to the barn. The three of them then touch the dome at the same time. Once doing so, the egg in the middle of the dome lights up, revealing a fourth handprint, indicating that the dome needs a fourth hand. Reception =Ratings= The episode was watched by 10.64 million American viewers, and received an 18-49 rating/share of 2.4/7, placing first in its timeslot and the night. =Critical reception= In regards to the episode's plot, Ashley Knierim of The Huffington Post said \\"The season is winding down, but CBS is still throwing every possible scenario our way. It's been a very busy eight days in Chester's Mill, and Monday's episode just adds to the crazy.\\" Andrea Reiher of Zap2it commented on Natalie Zea's portrayal as Maxine, saying \\"We'll confess that we had guessed Maxine was the person to whom Barbie was speaking on the phone from the pilot, but we did not expect her to be so bold as to kiss him in front of Big Jim. It's nice to be surprised...Maxine's vision for Chester's Mill is certainly an interesting left turn from the book. We love the idea of a wild frontier town-type thing happening, but we wonder how long that can carry on inside the dome? Is it a temporary thing? Or is Maxine a big bad who is here to stay a while?\\" Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly also commented positively on Natalie Zea's character, saying \\"Max immediately added a whole lot of plot momentum to the show. She convinced Big Jim to round up all the guns so that they/she could be in control. She also revealed that she knew Barbie by giving him a very memorable smooch, and promised to tell Julia about the whole whoops-I-killed-your-husband thing...So basically, Max has only been on the show for an episode, and already she‚Äôs A) the most powerful enemy for Big Jim we‚Äôve ever met B) the third corner of a Barbie/Julia romantic triangle, and C) established that she knows all the secrets of everyone in town. More of her, please!\\" Ted Kindig of BuddyTV gave the episode a positive review, saying \\"It's a relatively interesting evening under the dome this week, particularly as the show alternately explores Big Jim's sketchy past in illegal drug manufacturing and his present effort to reduce gun violence -- the former is a bit obvious at this point, but at least the story's moving now; the latter is most interesting on a meta level for its obliviously apolitical take on a hot-button issue, like an abortion-themed episode that politely acknowledges Roe vs. Wade but never engages with it. Quibbles aside, I'll take a plot line that's interesting either in spite of or because of its faults over the silly pink star monarch gobbledygook any day.\\" Tim Surette of TV.com wrote negatively about the episode, saying \\"Since \\"The Fourth Hand\\" had such a huge to-do list, it sped along at lightning speed, hitting so many different micro-plots that it never spent enough time with any of them. A month ago Under the Dome would have devoted an entire episode to the arrival of a new drug in town, or tearing up the Second Amendment, or the search for the mini-dome, but in \\"The Fourth Hand\\" these stories were all crushed together into visual bullet points and we were the bloody mess left behind.\\" References Category:2013 American television episodes Category:Under the Dome episodes ","title":"The Fourth Hand (Under the Dome)"},{"id":"40237017","text":"Borealis is a Canadian power/progressive metal band from Orangeville, Ontario, Canada. Their music features soaring vocals, a focus on guitar riffs, as well as a bass-heavy backing rhythm. Their sound is likened to the more melodic realms of power metal, however, with each album they have introduced progressive elements to the mix. They are known for performing in an outstanding manner live; their first album was recorded in light of a well received opening performance for Sonata Arctica. In an interview, the band explained the origin of their name: \\"we were all hanging out one night and the northern lights (Aurora Borealis) could be seen above. We thought it would be a cool name, but with Aurora Borealis already being a successful band, we shortened it to Borealis\\". When the band began in 2005, they originally employed a female opera style vocalist Siobhan O'Brian as their lead vocals frontrunner. In 2006 they recorded a demo Eyes of a Dream. Siobhan left the band between 2006-2007. Matt Marinelli became Vocalist in September 2007, and 2008 marked the year Borealis released their first full-length album, World of Silence. In order to play this album live, they needed another guitarist, thus hiring Ken Fobert. In 2011 they recorded their second album, Fall from Grace, including Ken Fobert as a member of the band. Michael Briguglio replaced Ken between 2011-2013 and is a current guitarist for the band. They were signed by AFM Records in 2015 and released their third album, Purgatory. Biography =Formation, demo (2005‚Äì2006)= Borealis featured a female vocalist in their initial years, geared more towards a symphonic metal sound. With this lineup they recorded their first demo Eyes of a Dream. In September 2006, they opened for power metal bands Kamelot and Epica. The crowd's response was very positive; the band's promoter claimed it was \\"the best reaction to an opener he had ever heard\\". The band didn't like this setup though, claiming it to be limiting to the style of music they wished to produce. Before September 2007 they parted ways with Siobhan O'Brian. The band subsequently had a show opening for Sonata Arctica with Matt Marinelli in Siobhan's stead. After this performance, Matt became the lead singer for the band. =World of Silence (2008‚Äì2011)= 2008 marked the year Borealis released their first full-length album, World of Silence. They were not signed to any label at this point and the album was released on their own terms independently. It was recorded in The Recording House studio, courtesy of Sean Gregory of Emerald Rain. Gregory helped Borealis achieve the type of sound they wanted, and the album exceeded their expectations. In order to play this album live while staying faithful to the rhythm and lead guitar tracks, Borealis needed an additional guitarist. They looked towards a friend, Ken Fobert, to join them on their tour. After a jam session with Fobert, they confirmed his sound suited the band and hired him. =Fall from Grace (2011‚Äì2014)= After many shows, including shows where they opened for other famous acts like Edguy, they recorded a second album released internationally under Lion Music. Released in 2011, Fall from Grace featured a harder-edged sound in comparison to their first album. The album was released in Japan as well, aided by Japanese label Hydrant Music. The album was once again positively received. One review attributed that the band had adopted a \\"mature\\" song writing style that typically did not come so quickly to new bands. =Purgatory (2015-2017)= Since the release of Fall from Grace, the band went on a semi-hiatus. During this period they toured with Saxon, and played some venues in Europe. In 2013, Borealis released a teaser video promoting a new album they planned to release in 2014. In March 2014 on their Facebook page they indicated they were tracking for the new album. Then, in January 2015, they announced that their album was largely complete, and released portions of finished tracks. On May 7, 2015, AFM Records announced they had signed Borealis, and their new album, Purgatory was revealed. The release date was set for June 19, 2015 for Europe and July 21, 2015 for North America respectively. Regarding Purgatory, Matt Marinelli said: Purgatory is a serious concept album, with darker themes than their previous works. On August 12, 2016, the band announced that a founding member and the band's bassist Jamie Smith would be leaving Borealis due to him moving across Canada with his family. However, Jamie indicated that the band had a replacement who had been friends with members of the band for years. He also cited that the band was well into recording their next album. = The Offering (2018-present) = After a successful tour with Evergrey, Oceans of Slumber and Voyager during their previous album cycle, the band went back to the drawing board to come up with a new concept for the next album. After Purgatory's largely positive reception, they decided once again to continue with another concept album. Inspired by Matt Marinelli's love for horror movies, the band created a heart-wrenching album centred around the concept of a cult that sacrifices children in the name of their deity. Matt Marinelli explains the inspiration behind the concept in an interview with CROM Magazine: > I think with the story, the whole thing kind of started when I watched this > indie horror movie called ‚ÄúThe Devil‚Äôs Hand‚Äù and after I watched it, I > thought it was an interesting idea. So we took that idea of the cult and of > the children sacrificed and we put like a fictional twist on it [...] It‚Äôs > nothing that we would ever want to actually happen, but we find in the story > telling point of view, it really has a lot stronger impact.\\" The Offering has also come with some new beginnings. After taking some time to regroup after the departure of founding bass player Jamie Smith, the band welcomed the return of rhythm guitarist Ken Fobert, as well as their new bass player Trevor McBride. This is the second record produced by band's drummer and orchestrator Sean Dowell, and The Offering features bold orchestration, heavy guitars, emotive keys and gripping lyrics from start to finish. The album was released with AFM Records on March 23, 2018. Style and influences Borealis cites in interviews that when they formed they initially wished to emulate bands such as Nightwish or Sonata Arctica. They have modified their sound a bit since their debut, claiming to be influenced by bands such as Symphony X and Stratovarius when playing as openers for these famous acts. In an interview an anonymous Borealis member stated: Borealis's style consists of a rhythm guitar with a heavy bass end, double bass drums, baritone clean vocals similar to Russell Allen of Symphony X, and keys to expand options for their sound. Occasional virtuosic guitar riffs complement the rhythm, as well as guitar solos for both guitarists, and occasional keyboard solos. Matt Marinelli was asked which three albums of any band had changed his life, to which he listed Mercy Falls by Seventh Wonder, The Inner Circle by Evergrey, and Century Child by Nightwish.

After a three-year hiatus, the Blazers returned to the playoffs, facing the Houston Rockets, in the first round, their first meeting since 2009. The Blazers defeated the Rockets in six games, thanks to Damian Lillard's series-clinching three pointer in Game 6 at home, winning their first playoff series since 2000.

The season opened on 27 March 1982 and concluded on 18 September 1982 with the 1982 WAFL Grand Final contested between and . Under the coaching of John Todd, Swans won the 1982, 1983 and 1984 premierships before the financial lure of the VFL deprived it one by one of the stars of this period.Devaney, John; Full Points Footy‚Äôs WA Football Companion; pp. 297-298.

The WAFL also showed concern from the start of the season about declining attendances ‚Äì a problem that was to lead to radical changes to the structure of Australian Rules in subsequent years. Employment opportunities created by the mining boom in the Pilbara had caused several WAFL players to play in the De Grey league without a clearance during 1981, and the league announced players who did this would be suspended from the WAFL for two full seasons, though none actually were despite Ian Williams playing a practice match on 3 April for Port Hedland Panthers.Young, Doug; ‚ÄòWilliams Faces Suspension‚Äô; The West Australian, 5 April 1982, p. 99 Subiaco, depleted by their inability to afford to retain star State of Origin on-baller Gary Buckenara and the absence of league- quality key forwards,Spillman, Ken; Diehards: the Story of the Subiaco Football Club 1946-2000; pp. 205-209 set an unwanted record of losing their first sixteen matches, beating by one game their own record from 1902 and that of West Perth in 1939 for the worst start to a season in Western Australian League football. The Lions ultimately became the first one-win WAFL team since Swan Districts in 1968 ‚Äì their only win was like the 1968 Swans against East Fremantle. Under new president Rod Brown and coach Dennis Cometti West Perth, despite considerable injury problems early in the season, were the one major improver, rising to third and kicking a record finals score in their first major round match for four seasons, in the process becoming the most-watched team in the league and stimulating crowds in a tough season financially.Christian, Geoff; ‚ÄòWest Perth Have Reason to Smile‚Äô; The West Australian, 13 September 1982, p. 59 Season =Round 1= =Round 2= =Round 3 (Easter Weekend)= =Round 4= =Round 5= =Round 6= =Round 7= =Round 8= =Round 9= =Round 10= =Round 11 (Foundation Day)= =Round 12= =Round 13= =Round 14= =Round 15= =Round 16= =Round 17= =Round 18= =Round 19= =Round 20= =Round 21= Ladder Finals series =First Semi Final= =Second Semi Final= =Preliminary Final= =Grand Final= Notes The match was originally scheduled to be played on 1 June, but was postponed to 16 June and then 23 June, despite a request from Swan Districts to play in Perth on the afternoon (prime television time in Melbourne) of Monday, 21 June.

They considered their initial collaborations unimpressive, so Jenkins suggested collaborating with Murs, who provided lyrics. Their first album, The Ghetto Is Tryna Kill Me was released in June 2013, and followed with a short tour of the eastern United States, including gigs in New York's New Museum, Boston and Washington DC. The album is a concept album around Tyrone White, a young black man from a New York City housing project, who subsequently obtains a recording contract and gets a white girlfriend. Jenifer and Jenkins have described the album Tommy by The Who as an important influence. Reviewing the album, Baltimore City Paper 's Baynard Woods thought the group \\"actually manage to do service to punk and hip hop\\" and praised the band's sense of humour, particularly the music video for their first single, \\"My First White Girl\\". Washington City Paper's Marcus J Moore described the video for the group's \\"Warn A Brotha\\" as \\"a cool ode to skateboarding\\".  Music style and influences  They have described their influences as hip-hop, West Coast rap, The Isley Brothers, Led Zeppelin and reggae. While the band's music has been described by some critics as \\"rap-rock\\", Jenkins rejects that term, stating \\"I don't like 'rap rock' at all. Like I hate it. I think it's ‚Äî it's terrible!\\" and has explained that \\"what we've come together to do is just an extension of all of our experiences as black men, but we're not just limited to being black\\". Murs has complained that black music hasn't evolved since the 1980s, and that the music industry places no expectations on black rock groups being successful. Unlike many new bands, Jenkins places little importance on social media, though he did praise Wikipedia, saying \\"Wikipedia is nice. It‚Äôs a lot of nice people coming together sharing information ‚Äì no one‚Äôs making money.

The castle is part of the Medieval Town of Toru≈Ñ, one of the World Heritage Sites in Poland. History The Toru≈Ñ Castle was one of the first castles built by the order in the lands ceded to them by Duke Conrad of Masovia. The construction started in the mid 13th century, and continued for about a hundred years. It was the first Teutonic castle in the Che≈Çmno Land. The new town of Toru≈Ñ grew together with the Teutonic fortifications protecting it. The palace's historic value comes from the fact that it was the base for the Teutonic Knights when they began their first mission to colonize pagan Old Prussians, and subsequently the formation of the Teutonic state. The castle's first known function was as the residence of a Teutonic commander. Little of the castle survives to the present day, as it has been demolished in centuries since, with much destruction occurring during a town rebellion in 1454. The city rebelled on 4 February, and a few days later the small Teutonic garrison negotiated a surrender; they were allowed to leave the castle and the city. Shortly afterward, on 8 February, the castle was plundered, and then the Toru≈Ñ city council decided that it would be demolished to prevent the Teutonic Knights from reoccupying it. This event marked the beginning of the Thirteen Years' War (1454‚Äì66). The castle was partially excavated, rebuilt and turned into an historical monument in 1966 during the time of the People's Republic of Poland for the 500th anniversary of the Second Peace of Thorn. Architecture Unlike most later Teutonic castles, it was not a four-winged, rectangular conventional castle; instead it had only two wings, laid out in a pattern similar to that of a horseshoe. The largest section of the castle to survive to present day is the sewage tower (dansker). The tower is located over a stream that joins the nearby Vistula river. The other section of the former castle remaining today are the cellars. Other sections of the former castle now function as permanent exhibits. The permanent exhibits, which are mostly in the palace's vaults, are displayed in settings such as the armoury, kitchen, dormitory, scriptorium, and the mint.

The oldest parts of the church is the Romanesque nave, while the large choir is Gothic and richly decorated in the style of the time. Inside, the church has an altarpiece from the 15th century and a Gothic choir stall, among other things. History and architecture Altarpiece (15th century) The church in Burs derives its unusual shape from the fact that it was built in stages. It is constructed of plastered limestone. The nave is the oldest part of the church, dating from the early 13th century. The large tower was built in the middle of the same century, while the dis-proportionally large Gothic choir was built a century later, replacing an earlier Romanesque choir and apse. The choir portal of the church is richly decorated. The doorway displays Gothic sculptures depicting a blessing Christ, apostles and saints, as well as a large frieze spanning the whole of the portal, depicting the Parable of the Ten Virgins. The choir, and hence the choir portal, was probably built by a stonemasons' workshop sometimes referred to as Egypticus, which was active on Gotland during 1330-1380. The same workshop probably made an unusual, elaborate carved limestone choir bench inside the church, on which traces of original paint are still visible.Roosval, Johnny (1911) Die Kirchen Gotlands, ein Beitrag zur mittelalterlichen Kunstgeschichte Schwedens (Leipzig : E.A. Seeman) The interior is spacious and airy. Of furnishings, the altarpiece has been described as an unusually accomplished work of art made in L√ºbeck or northern Germany during the first half of the 15th century. The church also has a triumphal cross from the 13th century, traces of medieval stained glass paintings and several pieces if furnishings which are later, dating from the 18th century. The church was thoroughly renovated in 1960-1964. Burs Church belongs to the Diocese of Visby of the Church of Sweden.

In the Mathematics Subject Classification scheme (MSC2010), the field of \\"Set-valued and variational analysis\\" is coded by \\"49J53\\". History While this area of mathematics has a long history, the first use of the term \\"Variational analysis\\" in this sense was in an eponymous book by R. Tyrrell Rockafellar and Roger J-B Wets. R. Tyrrell Rockafellar, Roger J-B Wets, Variational Analysis, Springer-Verlag, 2005, , Existence of Minima A classical result is that a lower semicontinuous function on a compact set attains its minimum. Results from variational analysis such as Ekeland's variational principle allow us to extend this result of lower semicontinuous functions on non-compact sets provided that the function has a lower bound and at the cost of adding a small perturbation to the function. Generalized derivatives The classical Fermat's theorem says that if a differentiable function attains its minimum at a point, and that point is an interior point of its domain, then its derivative must be zero at that point. For problems where a smooth function must be minimized subject to constraints which can be expressed in the form of other smooth functions being equal to zero, the method of Lagrange multipliers, another classical result, gives necessary conditions in terms of the derivatives of the function. The ideas of these classical results can be extended to nondifferentiable convex functions by generalizing the notion of derivative to that of subderivative. Further generalization of the notion of the derivative such as the Clarke generalized gradient allow the results to be extended to nonsmooth locally Lipschitz functions. Frank H.

The find sent ripples of excitement through neighbouring villages and many residents collected what fossilised eggs they could find., brought them home and worshipped them.http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/south-asia/indias- jurassic-park-hopes-princely-lizards-will-attract-tourists Since then, excavations have thrown up a veritable trove of dinosaur remains - eggs, bones, and a skeleton which is now kept in a Kolkata museum - bringing hordes of scientists and tourists to the place. Piecing together the evidence in Balasinor, researchers now believe that Gujarat is home to one of the largest clutch of dinosaur hatcheries in the world. At least 13 species of dinosaurs lived here, possibly for more than 100 million years until their extinction some 66 million years ago. The soft soil made hatching and protecting eggs easier for the animals. So well-protected are the fossilised eggs found here that many researchers call them the best-preserved eggs in the world after the ones found in Aix-en-Provence in France. These fossilized dinosaur remains triggered off what tourism officials in Gujarat referred to as \\"dinosaur tourism\\".

Published by Department of Railways History Originally ordered in 1879 but the order was stopped.Forsyth, J.H. (1974) \\"Steam Locomotive Data\\" A follow-up order in 1882 was made, the specification originally for 2-4-0 tank locomotives with 5'0\\" diameter driving wheels made by the acting locomotive engineer Mr Scott. During his absence in England on official business this was changed by Mr T. Middelton to an 0-6-0 type with 4'0\\" diameter driving wheels, claiming that such locomotives would be capable of 30-33 mph in service. Despite Scott's protests, Commissioner Goodchap approved the changes and six locomotives were designed and built by Vulcan Foundry. The subsequent 0-6-0 locomotives became the R(285) class, later the Z18 class.Grunbach, A (1989) \\"A Compendium of New South Wales Steam Locomotives\\" p. 74-75 In August 1884 Mr Scott informed the commissioner that more locomotives were required with the opening of the Illawarra extension. Mr Middelton wanted more of the R(285 class), but Mr Scott recommended his original proposed design from 1881. After much hesitation by the government, Beyer, Peacock and Company were asked to design and build the locomotives. These became the F(351) class and went into service on the Sydney suburban network in 1885-86, being numbered 351 to 362. In 1887 six more locomotives of this design (numbered 363 to 3680) were delivered by Henry Vale of Sydney. No. 366 featured in the Redfern collision of 1894. The design was extremely similar to a number of 2-4-0 tank locomotives supplied to the Isle of Wight Central Railway from 1864. A similar locomotive was delivered to the South Australian Railways from 1884 as their P-class.Grunbach, A (1989) \\"A Compendium of New South Wales Steam Locomotives\\" p. 85-86 Their running life came to an end in 1901 as a result of the findings on the Sydenham derailment involving No. 363 and the whole class was taken out of passenger work. The F351 class were known to oscillate and rock at high speeds and were officially limited to 30 mph. A factor in the Sydenham derailment was the driver exceeding the official speed limit. The locomotive was believed to be doing 51 mph when the accident occurred. The entire class was subsequently withdrawn from passenger work and allocated to various shunting, yard and depot duties. A number of the class were modified with a heavy cast iron front buffer beam in an attempt to stabilise the front of the locomotive after 1901.http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=4807205 Between 1906 and 1929 ten of the class were sold to various private railway operators. All members of the class had been withdrawn from passenger work by 1914. Eleven were still on the books at this stage and were renumbered Lo.19-Lo.26 (Lo. Indicated that they were no longer in revenue-earning service). In 1924 they were renumbered in the X10 class, bearing numbers 1031-1033, 1035-1037 and 1039-1043.http://www.australiansteam.com/1076.htm From 1914, members of the class still in NSWGR service were rebuilt with the same domed boilers that replaced the dome-less type originally supplied on the R285 class. A number of other modifications were made to the class such as replacing the leaf spring on the front axle with twin coil springs. For reasons unknown 1033 at some stage had the original parallel buffers on the rear replaced with longer bottle-shaped Turton buffers. In 1966, 1036 with withdrawn and scrapped, but during an overhaul the boiler was given to 1076, previously numbered R288 then 1804.

Born in Caherdavin, Limerick, Collins first played competitive hurling whilst at school in St. Caimin's C.S., Shannon. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of eighteen when he first linked up with the Clare minor team, before later lining out with the under-21 side. He made his senior debut in the 2012 championship. Collins has since gone on to play a key role for Clare, and has won one All-Ireland medal. At club level Collins is a dual senior championship medallist with Cratloe. Playing career =Minor and under-21= Collins first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Clare minor team in 2010. He won his first Munster medal that year following a 1-16 to 1-11 defeat of Waterford. Clare subsequently qualified for the All-Ireland decider against Kilkenny, however, Collins's side faced a narrow 2-10 to 0-14 defeat. By 2012 Collins had joined the Clare under-21 team. He won a Munster medal in that grade as Clare defeated Tipperary by 1-16 to 1-14. Clare subsequently faced Kilkenny in the All-Ireland decider. After trailing at half-time, Clare outscored their opponents by 1-10 to 0-4 in the second period of play to secure a 2-17 to 2-11 victory. It was Collins's first All-Ireland medal in the grade. Clare dominated the under-21 series once again in 2013. A 1-17 to 2-10 defeat of Tipperary in the provincial decider gave Collins a second Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland saw Clare face first-time finalists Antrim. In a complete mismatch, Clare powered to a 2-28 to 0-12 victory, with Collins collecting a second consecutive All-Ireland medal. =Senior= Collins made his senior championship debut at right wing-forward in a 2-17 to 1-18 defeat by Waterford on 17 June 2012. On 8 September 2013, Collins lined out against Cork in his first All-Ireland final. Three second- half goals through Conor Lehane, Anthony Nash and Pa Cronin, and a tenth point of the game from Patrick Horgan gave Cork a one-point lead as injury time came to an end. A last-gasp point from corner-back Domhnall O'Donovan earned Clare a 0-25 to 3-16 draw. The replay on 28 September was regarded as one of the best in recent years. Clare's Shane O'Donnell was a late addition to the team, and went on to score a hat-trick of goals in the first nineteen minutes of the game. Horgan top scored for Cork, however, further goals from Conor McGrath and Darach Honan secured a 5-16 to 3-16 victory for Clare. It was Collins's first All-Ireland medal. He rounded off the season by collecting his first All-Star award, while he was also a nominee for Hurler of the Year. In 2014 along with his brother Sean he joined up with the Clare senior football team who were managed by his father Colm. He played during their HFL Div 4 campaign, but missed out on the final. He then lined out in the Munster Senior Football Championship game with Waterford, he missed out on the replay due to hurling. He returned to the side for the Munster semi final where Clare went down by 4 points to Kerry. Clare then entered round 2 of the qualifiers where they faced Carlow. Collins scored a goal as his side ran out 4-26 to 2-13 winners. In the next round despite leading for long stages of the game Clare fell short by a point to Kildare. At the end of the 2014 Collins along with his brother reported they would be committing to football only for the 2015 season. In October 2015, it was reported that Collins would again play with the Clare footballers and hurlers in 2016.

History In 1999, the Oregon Legislature passed an electric industry restructuring law, SB 1149, with the intent of establishing a stable, consistent funding source for residential, commercial and industrial electric efficiency, renewable energy and market transformation programs. The legislation requires the state‚Äôs largest investor-owned electric utilities to collect a 3 percent public purpose charge and authorized the Oregon Public Utility Commission, OPUC, to direct a portion of those funds to an independent, non-government entity. In 2000 and 2001, the OPUC and interested parties helped form the nonprofit Energy Trust of Oregon. The nonprofit has an independent board of directors and operates consistent with a grant agreement with the OPUC. In 2001, Energy Trust articles of incorporation and bylaws were adopted and the first executive director hired. Energy Trust also has three advisory councils‚Äîthe Conservation Advisory Council, Renewable Energy Advisory Council and Diversity Advisory Council‚Äîto provide stakeholder perspectives on its programs, budgets and action plans. Energy Trust began operation in March 2002, charged with investing in cost- effective electric energy efficiency, helping to pay the above-market costs of renewable energy resources, implementing market transformation programs, delivering services with low administrative and program support costs and maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction.  Funding  Energy Trust is funded by customers of Portland General Electric, Pacific Power, NW Natural, Cascade Natural Gas and Avista. Customers of these five utilities pay a dedicated percentage of their utility bills to support a variety of energy efficiency and renewable energy services and programs. As a result of SB 1149, which applies to electric energy, PGE and Pacific Power collect a 3 percent public purpose charge from their customers to support: # Energy conservation in K-12 schools delivered through school districts # Low-income housing energy assistance delivered through Oregon Housing and Community Services # Energy efficiency, renewable energy and market transformation programs for residential and business customers delivered through Energy Trust, an independent, third-party Funding for natural gas efficiency comes from public purpose charges paid by Oregon customers of NW Natural, Cascade Natural Gas and Avista. This funding is provided pursuant to settlement agreements in OPUC proceedings. Energy Trust administers the funds through contracts established with NW Natural in 2003, Cascade Natural Gas in 2006 and Avista in 2017. In 2009, through an agreement with NW Natural and the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission, Energy Trust also began serving NW Natural's customers in Washington. In 2007, the Oregon Legislature passed the Oregon Renewable Energy Act, SB 838. Through the legislation, the collection of the 3 percent public purpose charge was extended from 2012 to 2026, and PGE and Pacific Power were allowed to seek additional electric efficiency funding above the 3 percent public purpose charge with the goal of avoiding the need to purchase more expensive electricity. Energy Trust receives supplemental funds authorized by the legislation.  Goals  As part of its oversight of Energy Trust, the OPUC adopted performance measures against which to benchmark Energy Trust's performance. OPUC performance measures are typically updated annually. Energy Trust provides the OPUC with quarterly and annual reports measuring actual performance against the target metrics. Energy Trust also maintains operational goals to maximize investments in its 2020-2024 Strategic Plan.  Programs  In general, Energy Trust operates its programs through contracts with service providers. A volunteer, non-stakeholder board of directors oversees Energy Trust management, provides strategic and policy direction and approves the organization‚Äôs budget and major expenditures. The board carries out its oversight with guidance from three advisory councils: Conservation Advisory Council, Diversity Advisory Council and Renewable Energy Advisory Council. Energy Trust offers cash incentives for a variety of energy-efficiency improvements and renewable energy systems for homes, businesses, industrial facilities, agricultural operations and public and nonprofit buildings. Other assistance provided includes information, services and technical assistance to help ratepayers identify and prioritize projects that fit their budget and goals.

Many have cited this film as one of the worst films ever made. Once thought lost, it was rediscovered decades later by the cult film enthusiasts at Grindhouse Releasing who have digitally restored the film and presented it in Blu-ray and DVD. Grindhouse Releasing original poster art Plot Young American hippie and war veteran Mike (Asher Tzarfati) travels to Israel shortly after his involvement in Vietnam. Hitchhiking and \\"bumming around\\" hippie Mike meets up with three Israelis along his journey; stage actress Elizabeth (Lily Avidan), another female hippie friend (Tzila Karney), and her Hebrew-speaking boyfriend Komo (Shmuel Wolf). They join a larger group of hippies and decide to form an isolated community on a deserted island, where they can live in peace \\"without clothes, without government, and without borders.\\"Blu-ray.com ‚ÄúAn American Hippie in Israel‚Äù Blu-ray Review by Brian Orndorf, September 13, 2013 The hippies are not without their problems, and find them in two gun-toting, top hat-clad, mime-like enforcers (who regularly appear out of nowhere) and who are out to make Mike's life miserable. Reviewer Brian Orndorf notes; ‚ÄúSefer doesn't explain who these guys are or what they're ultimately after, hinting that the duo might be the personification of \\"the Man\\" out to silence the hippie uproar.‚Äù Led by American Mike, the quartet of hippies manages to survive a gun attack by the mad mimes and the group flees to the uninhabited island. On the road trip to the island, the hippies quickly forget their worries, tossing their clothes in the wind and enjoying the ride in Elizabeth‚Äôs chic convertible car. As they drive down the Israeli coast, they stop along the way to make love and to pick up the supplies they will need on their island - including the purchase of groceries and a live lamb. They finally arrive at their intended destination and park their car on shore, using a small dinghy boat to row their way out to the island. Upon reaching the tiny isolated land mass, the elated hippies do a free form dance, skinny dip and, when dusk hits, settle in for some canned food by the fireside. That night, the hippies pronounce their love for freedom and for each other as well as proclaiming how ‚Äúfull of shit‚Äù the world is. They wake up the following morning, however, to discover that both their boat and lamb have mysteriously vanished overnight. Although Mike makes a valiant effort, shark-infested waters make it impossible to swim back to the mainland where the car sits on shore. As the women get hungry and tempers begin to flare, the men forage for food, winding up with little more than a handful of barnacles Mike managed to scrub off some rocks. The discovery of the still very much alive lamb leads to the final apocalyptic scene. The idyllic situation quickly descends into paradise lost as the dark true nature of unregenerate man, hippie rhetoric notwithstanding, is laid bare. Cast * Asher Tzarfati as Mike * Lily Avidan as Elizabeth * Shmuel Wolf as Komo * Tzila Karney as Fran√ßoise Development and production An American Hippie in Israel was written and directed by Amos Sefer, with principal photography having commenced around 1971. It was director Sefer's second film. Release An American Hippie in Israel had its original limited theatrical release in 1972, but initially failed to find a distributor willing to take on the film. Four decades later, it was rediscovered by film editor/distributor Bob Murawski of cult film distribution company, Grindhouse Releasing.DVD Talk \\"An American Hippie in Israel\\" Blu-ray review, by Jesse Skeen, September 14, 2013 Grindhouse Releasing posted a trailer for the film on YouTube that Murawski had edited, which was then picked up and seen by cult fans all over the world, including in Israel, the country of origin. Suddenly the film was receiving renewed attention and quickly became a hot ticket on the Tel Aviv midnight movie circuit, where it became so popular that it is now screened monthly. In Tel Aviv, led on by uber fan Yaniv Edelstein, the film's enthusiasts have acted out scenes from the film and talked back to the screen, interacting with the film much in the same way as fans do with the American midnight staple The Rocky Horror Picture Show.DVD Verdict Blu-ray review \\"An American Hippie in Israel\\" by Tom Becker Hippie was released for the first time on Blu-ray and DVD on September 10, 2013, by Grindhouse Releasing. The film had also previously screened theatrically in the United States and at the Grindhouse Film Festival on August 27, 2013. =Reception= An American Hippie in Israel has been called a ‚Äúcinematic oddity‚Äù with a ‚Äúcreepy sincerity.‚Äù Gil Shefler of The Jewish Daily Forward described the film as \\"perfectly awful,\\" offering that it \\"[p]robably [is] the worst Israeli movie ever made, and a serious candidate for the worst movie of all time, which, surprisingly, is enjoying an unexpected revival 38 years after it was made.\\" Alexandra Oliver of Partisan Magazine agreed, titling her review, \\"Is This the Worst Israeli Film Ever Made?\\" Reviewer Brian Orndorf of Blu-ray.com remarked, ‚Äúfor all the nonsense and pull-your-hair-out padding that's included in the feature, Sefer has a weird vision for \\"Hippie\\" that almost works if one squints hard enough, attempting to make an anti-war picture that's soaked in oddity and nudity. It's an admirable effort, with periods of floppy B-movie shenanigans that are surprisingly entertaining. Orndorf gave Grindhouse Releasing's Blu-ray release a rating of 4 stars out of 5, and 4-1/2 stars alone for the generous bonus materials on the release, commenting that ‚ÄúAs a punchline, An American Hippie in Israel is easily digestible and consistently amusing‚Äîa perfect addition to any cult movie collection.‚Äù See also * List of cult films * List of films related to the hippie subculture * List of films considered the worst References External links  *An American Hippie in Israel at Trailers from Hell Category:1972 films Category:1970s science fiction action films Category:Hippie films Category:Israeli films Category:1970s science fiction comedy films Category:1970s rediscovered films Category:1972 comedy films Category:Israeli science fiction films Category:Israeli action films Category:Rediscovered Israeli films ","title":"An American Hippie in Israel"},{"id":"40238024","text":"The Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party was a political party in Australia from 2013 to 2017. Ricky Muir held a seat for the party in the Australian Senate from 2013 to 2016. The party voluntarily de-registered with the AEC on 8 February 2017. History The Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party (AMEP) was formed on 11 May 2013 in Queensland at a public meeting of motoring enthusiasts. The formation of the party followed moves by state governments, particularly in Queensland, to toughen anti-hooning and vehicle impoundment legislation. The Australian Electoral Commission registered the party on 9 July 2013. Formation and structure The AMEP's structure included State Councils and a Central Executive. The Queensland State Council and the Central Executive were formed when the party was established on 11 May 2013. At that point the Central Executive was made up of the Queensland State Council's office bearers. The first Annual General Meeting of the AMEP was held on 11 July 2013. The Queensland State Council office bearers were returned as the Central Executive's office bearers. The Victorian State Council was formed on 17 July 2013. The Western Australian State Council was formed on 23 July 2013. The New South Wales State Council was formed on 7 August 2013. The Victorian State Council was suspended by the party's executive in October 2013 over claims that it had set up a Facebook page without permission and had engaged in what ABC News reported as being labelled \\"illegal and unauthorised use of AMEP identification, confidential information, incorrect policy announcements, and the misuse of the party brand\\". The former chairman of the Victorian State Council, Scott McDonald, told the ABC that it was unclear why the action had been taken. 2013 Federal election The party endorsed Senate candidates in the 2013 Federal Election in New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia. The party has been involved in Glenn Druery's Minor Party Alliance. Ricky Muir represented AMEP in Victoria and won a seat in the senate after preference distribution from a record-low primary vote of 0.51 percent or 17,122 first preferences he assumed his seat on 1 July 2014. Larger parties including the incoming government are looking at changes to the group voting ticket system. On 10 October 2013 Muir announced he would enter into an alliance with the Palmer United Party. Muir's senior adviser was electoral consultant Glenn Druery, but he was sacked by Muir less than a month later and was escorted out of Parliament. Muir stated that Druery did not \\"get along with the staff\\". Muir also hired former New South Wales state politician Peter Breen to advise him on legislation. Muir lost his seat at the federal election held on 2 July 2016, leaving the AMEP without any representation in the federal parliament.

Since 2014,the tagline for this tournament is \\"Premiering Talent and Sportsmanship\\".http://mcoba.org/mckk-p7-rugby-tournament-press- conference-21-jan-2014/ History MCKK has always been passionate about rugby. It has been a major game for the school since it was first introduced by then Headmaster Mr. N.J. Ryan (later Dato') back in 1956. Naming the team the MCKK All-Blacks, taking after the legendary New Zealand national team, their fortunes have both waxed and waned over the years, yet they remain one of the most formidable rugby teams in the country. The Tournament is the brainchild of the All Blacks Revival Committee (ABR), a group of the school rugby playing alumni who came together to revive and infuse new life into the proud tradition of rugby excellence at MCKK. Joint Organizing Committee Chairman Zain Yusoff said, Our participation in the sport during our school days played a key role in our development and growth as people, and we wanted the current students at the school to have the same experiences we did. We invited schools which had the same commitment to rugby as we did, and a history of excellence in the game to compete at what we hope will become the most prestigious tournament for 7-a-side rugby in the country. Zain Yusoff added, ¬Ä¬úTeam sports like rugby fostered school spirit and respect for rivals, sportsmanship and fairplay. These values cannot be taught from textbooks but have to be lived to be understood. And we are delighted by the support we have been given by the Ministry of Education who bought into our point of view and have given us their whole-hearted support to raise the game under their \\"One Student, One Sport program\\"¬Ä¬ù. Zain Yusoff concluded, \\"¬Ä¬úThis Tournament is more than just about playing a game. All of us from MCKK are looking forward to sharing our culture and hospitality with the participating schools. For many of us, it a way of giving back something to the younger generation. It about sharing values, learning through experience, and of course, enjoying the game we all love so much.¬Ä\\" After six tournaments, the NJ Ryan Cup have traveled to three countries (Malaysia, New Zealand and Hong Kong).

Early life David Patterson Muzzey was born on 8 November 1838 in Cambridgeport, Massachusetts, to Reverend Artemas B. Muzzey and Hepsibeth Patterson Muzzey. His ancestors fought during the American Revolutionary War on the American side; Isaac Muzzey was killed during Battle of Lexington and was buried under the Lexington monument. The ground whereupon the battle took place was property of Niebur Muzzey, who later donated it to the town of Lexington. Muzzey was educated in Cambridge public schools, attended the Harvard University as well as Hopkins Classical School. In March 1854 he moved to Concord, New Hampshire and lived there until September 1857 when he moved with his parents to Newburyport, Massachusetts. Later he studied law in the office of his brother Henry W. Muzzey in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1860 he was admitted to Suffolk bar in Boston and started his practice settled in the building that once belonged to Judge Samuel Livermore. He was part of the Wide Awakes in Fall of 1860. Civil War On 23 May 1861, he enlisted as a private in Company A, 1st Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry and camped with the men at Fresh Pond in ice houses. A minor unrest broke out among the troops due to the condition of food they were served ‚Äì to rein in the tempers Col. Robert Cowdin was called. Inadequate lodging resulted in the camp being moved away and designated as \\"Camp Cameron\\". On 15 June the regiment was ordered to proceed to Boston. Later it marched to Washington, D. C., then Georgetown where it established \\"Camp Banks\\". The regiment remained there until it was called to fight during First Battle of Bull Run. After retreating, it returned to Washington. In Bladensburg Muzzey was promoted to second lieutenant and mustered with 23rd Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry with which he fought at Roanoke Island and New Bern as part of Burnside's North Carolina Expedition. In New Bern he was tasked with provost duty. On 17 July he resigned commission and returned to Massachusetts. On 16 September he was again commissioned as 2nd lieutenant in Company G, 41st Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry commanded by Col. Thomas Edward Chickering (later reorganized as 3rd Massachusetts Volunteer Cavalry). On 1 November he was promoted to first lieutenant. The regiment acted as bodyguard to Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks on board of the steamer North Star bound for New Orleans where Banks was to relieve Gen. Benjamin Butler. Upon arriving Muzzey's regiment was sent to Baton Rouge for provost duty.

The to-be \\"Forlorn Hope\\" never stormed the fort as it surrendered first; no medals were awarded on the ground that the unit failed to assault the earthworks. Following the surrender the regiment was moved to New Orleans to become part of 4th Cavalry Brigade under Gen. U. A. M. Dudley, inhabitant of Roxbury. Regiment took part in Red River Campaign and later, after returning to New Orleans, it ventured to fight in the Shenandoah Valley where Muzzey served for several months in the staff of Gen.

Francis Donald Klingender (1907 Klingender, F[rancis D[onald] ] Dictionary of Art Historians, 2013. Retrieved 14 August 2013. Archived here. - 9 July 1955\\"Editors' Foreword and Acknowledgments\\" in Animals in Art and Thought to the End of the Middle Ages. Edited by Evelyn Antal and John Harthan. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1971, pp. xxiii-xxiv. ) was a Marxist art historian and exponent of Kunstsoziologie whose uncompromising views meant that he never quite fitted into the British art history establishment. Klingender was born in Goslar, Germany, to British parents. At the start of the first World War, his father, Louis Henry Weston Klingender (1861-1950), was interned near Berlin on suspicion of spying for the British. The family moved back to England in the 1920s and Klingender supported them while attending night classes at the London School of Economics. He subsequently embarked on an academic career in sociology, becoming a lecturer in that subject at the University of Hull, which position he retained until his death. His magnum opus was Animals in Art and Thought to the End of the Middle Ages, published posthumously, and edited by Evelyn Antal, wife of Frederick Antal, and John Harthan. Klingender inherited an interest in this subject from his father who had been a painter of animals, and he added to that his own sociological, Marxist and Freudian interpretations. His thesis was that as well as being the companions and servants of man, the depiction of animals in art was symbolic of the hidden or secret urges of society. He was encouraged in his work by Julian Huxley, whose suggestions were incorporated into the final work. Klingender had intended to complete the work up to the nineteenth century, and possibly later, however, on his death the manuscript was only substantially complete up to the end of the Middle Ages and the editors took the decision to publish only up to that point, hence the chosen title. Later periods were added as an Epilogue from the available notes. Selected publications * Money Behind the Screen. A report prepared on behalf of the Film Council by F. D.

Covering an area of , the course was closed to racing in 1848 and is now an area of common land for recreation. It is a well travelled walking route because Offa's Dyke Path passes through the site.  Location and facilities  The common is located west of Oswestry, by the B4580 road. A limited amount of parking is available at South Common, and Tanat Valley Coaches route No 78 from Oswestry also stops by the site.Shropshire Council \\"Oswestry Old Racecourse Course\\".

History  This site is located on a hilltop called 'Cyrn y Bwch', which translates as ‚ÄòHorns of the Buck‚Äô and was historically seen as a barrier between England and Wales. Racing is thought to have begun here in the early 17th century and the figure- of-eight track extended to . Race meets lasted up to three days and, in the town of Oswestry, signalled the beginning of drinking and social events. The infamous Jack Mytton was among the local characters closely involved in these events, at one time owning a stable of 40 horses. By the early 19th century, the racing was big business and it also brought large crowds, drinking, gambling and pickpockets and many people started to avoid the event. The arrival of the railways is thought to have contributed to the cessation of race meets as this enabled both horses and racegoers to travel further afield to the larger racecourses. The final meeting was held in September 1848, the same year that the Shrewsbury to Chester railway line opened. Today, significant evidence of the old racecourse remains, including the remains of the figure-of-eight course and grandstand.Greyhound Derby \\"Oswestry racecourse\\".

In August 2019 the company became the 13th energy supplier to collapse since 2018, affecting around 7,500 domestic and 500 business customers. History LoCO2 Energy was established in 2009 as the retail arm of a vertically integrated group of energy companies known as TradeLink Solutions. Solarplicity began in 2012 as a provider of solar panel systems. It acquired and rebranded LoCO2 Energy in spring 2017. An initiative to install solar panels on Stoke-on-Trent council homes, marketed as Community Energy Scheme, commenced in 2018. Energy tariffs Solarplicity offered several green energy plans to domestic accounts including fixed, variable and smart meter tariffs. Businesses were offered a gas and renewable electricity tariff with no standing charge. Fuel mix Solarplicity's overall fuel mix for 2017/2018 saw 100% of electricity generated from renewables. Customer service Solarplicity was ranked lowest for customer service of 30 energy suppliers in a 2019 survey published by consumer group Which?, citing issues with its online and phone customer service, and poor handling of complaints. Citizens Advice quarterly assessment of energy suppliers has consistently rated Solarplicity poorly. For the period January‚ÄìMarch 2019 it was placed 32nd out of 39 suppliers with an overall score of 2.3/5, a slight improvement on the previous quarter. Review website Trustpilot lists the company as \\"poor\\". Recurring comments involve billing issues and overdue refunds. The Energy Ombudsman stated there were 3,324 complaints against Solarplicity in 2019, including 583 in July. Regulator action Industry regulator Ofgem can issue enforcement action against energy companies it believes may breach its licence conditions. A provisional order signals an investigation of an apparent breach. A final order can be issued when Ofgem is satisfied a breach has occurred. An operator may face fines or have its licence to operate revoked. =First Provisional Order= The Energy Ombudsman investigated over 1,000 complaints against the supplier in 2018. Highlighting customer service and account switching issues, on 22 February 2019 Ofgem issued a provisional order banning Solarplicity from taking on new customers for three months and also prohibiting increases of vulnerable customers' direct debit payments. Citizens Advice supported this move. Channel 4 programme Supershoppers broadcast in May claimed Solarplicity staff were \\"very sneaky\\", repeatedly stating they were unable accept new customers because the company was \\"changing tariffs\\", not due to a banning order. In only one of five calls made by Supershoppers did staff admit they were \\"taking time to rectify issues with current customers.\\" In a statement for the show, the energy supplier claimed it had \\"made significant improvements to its customer service performance.\\" Three months after issuing the provisional order, Ofgem determined Solarplicity had taken sufficient steps to address its concerns and allowed the order to lapse. Amongst agreed undertakings, the company would not acquire new domestic customers until 5 August 2019, except for a limited number under its community energy scheme. Utility Week, an industry journal, revealed that despite Ofgem's relaxation, complaints to the Energy Ombudsman had actually surged, with over 2,000 complaints during January‚ÄìMay 2019 and 478 in April alone. The ombudsman indicated there were problems with timely remediation including goodwill payments and refunds. Solarplicity suggested customers were bypassing its complaints process and contacting the ombudsman first. The company repeated claims of service improvements. =Second Provisional Order= In May 2019, Ofgem demanded Solarplicity settle outstanding feed-in tariff (FIT) payments due to several energy generators and meet ongoing obligations. The company had failed to pay some generators on time despite receiving FIT levelisation payments itself. Solarplicity missed further payments in June. Following fresh complaints Ofgem was satisfied that the company had breached its rules and confirmed the order in August. The order lapsed when Solarplicity Supply ceased trading and its licence was revoked. Partial sale to Toto Energy and collapse of Solarplicity Supply In late July 2019, 43,000 of Solarplicity's 60,000 domestic accounts were acquired by Toto Energy. Transfer of affected customers occurred early August. The agreement included Toto supplying all Community Energy Scheme customers. Solarplicity continued to serve business customers and the remaining domestic accounts. Shortly after the Toto deal, Solarplicity Supply ceased trading. Solarplicity denied speculation in The Guardian that it sold off its \\"valuable\\" accounts to Toto, leaving Ofgem to cover debts. The newspaper believed Solarplicity owed over ¬£3.5m in outstanding credit balances when it ceased trading. The week prior to the collapse, some customers, including those transferred to Toto Energy, reported erroneous direct debit payments taken from their accounts. Ofgem appointed EDF Energy as the supplier of last resort (SoLR) for impacted residential customers, ensuring there was no disruption to energy supply. Customers transferred to Toto Energy faced further disruption when it failed in October, just three months after the Solarplicity transaction. Financial reporting and administrations Administrators were appointed to Solarplicity Supply and Solarplicity Energy on 19 August 2019, shortly before Companies Court winding up hearings petitioned by HM Revenue & Customs and smart meter infrastructure company Smart DCC. Accounts to 31 March 2018 for both companies were seven months overdue. Ofgem stated Solarplicity Supply owed National Grid Gas over ¬£140,000 and Smart DCC over ¬£280,000. For the year ended 31 March 2017, Solarplicity Energy Limited's profit was ¬£26,177 on a turnover of ¬£13.1m; this compares to a profit for the previous year of ¬£81,582 on a turnover of ¬£12.1m.https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/06895776/filing- history/MzIxMDAyMzIxM2FkaXF6a2N4/document?format=pdf&download;=0 In July 2019, four other companies were placed in administration. Winding-up petitions against several Solarplicity businesses had also been instigated by HM Revenue & Customs. At the time Solarplicity stated the petitions were settled, dismissed by or adjourned. In 2018, Solarplicity Ltd, the energy generation arm, was put into liquidation on 14 May following a winding up petition from HM Revenue & Customs. Documents filed at Companies House indicate a total of ¬£3.96 million in outstanding and overdue taxes owed by this entity.https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/09749982/filing-history =Peerglow Group= Solarplicity Group which formerly owned Solarplicity Energy Limited was renamed Peerglow Group in 2019 and performs head office activities.

Passed in 2004, it allows Canadians who had been convicted of a crime in another nation to apply to serve their sentence, or a portion thereof, in a Canadian prison. The Act gives the Minister of Public Safety the authority to approve or decline prisoners' applications for transfer. The Act was passed shortly before Conservative Stephen Harper was elected Prime Minister of Canada in 2005. Legal journalists and legal scholars criticized the Harper government for arbitrarily declining to approve transfers without adequate reasons. According to The Globe and Mail on January 19, 2012, Justice Robert Barnes ruled that Vic Toews had failed to provide adequate reasons when he declined to approve the transfer of Richard Goulet. Barnes called decisions like this \\"pro forma\\" decisions, which were usually approved because it was in Canada's interest to know when felons were scheduled for release, and because it was in Canada's interest to enrol prisoners in the Canadian parole system, so their transition from prison could be monitored. Barnes's ruling noted twelve other cases where Toews and his predecessors had declined to approve prisoner transfers without supplying an adequate explanation. In 2009 the Canadian Civil Liberties Association criticized amendments the Conservatives were proposing to the law‚Äîamendments that relaxed the obligations the Minister of Public Safety had to explain his or her decisions.

International career Great talent who possessed then 18-year-old Igor, brought him the call in Croatia U18 national football team. Debut in the national U18 team he had on 22 May 2007. against Bosnia and Herzegovina in Ora≈°je.

On August 14, 2013, the Airbus A300 flying the route crashed and burst into flames short of the runway on approach to Birmingham‚ÄìShuttlesworth International Airport. Both pilots were pronounced dead at the scene of the crash. They were the only people aboard the aircraft. Aircraft and crew N155UP, the aircraft involved in the accidentThe aircraft involved in the accident was a 10-year-old Airbus A300F4-622R, registered as N155UP. It was built in 2003; UPS took delivery of it in February 2004. It was powered by Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines. At the time of the accident, it had accumulated approximately 11,000 flight hours in 6,800 flight cycles (a flight cycle is one takeoff and landing). The captain of Flight 1354 was 58-year old Cerea Beal, Jr. Prior to being hired by UPS, Beal was employed by TWA as a flight engineer and then first officer on the Boeing 727. He was hired by UPS in October 1990 as a 727 flight engineer and became a 727 first officer in August 1994. Twice, in 2000 and again in 2002, Beal began and then withdrew from training to upgrade to captain on the 727. He transitioned to the A300 as a first officer in 2004 and then as a captain in 2009. At the time of the accident, he had accumulated 6,406 flight hours at UPS, 3,265 of which were on the A300. The first officer was 37-year-old Shanda Fanning. Fanning was hired by UPS in 2006 as a 727 flight engineer. She became a first officer on the Boeing 757 in 2007, then transitioned to the Boeing 747 in 2009. She began flying the A300 in June 2012. At the time of the accident, she had accumulated 4,721 total flight hours, including 403 hours on the A300. Accident The aircraft crashed at about 04:47 local time (CDT, 09:47 UTC) while making a localizer non-precision approach to runway 18 at Birmingham‚ÄìShuttlesworth International Airport. It clipped trees and struck ground three times uphill. The fuselage broke apart, with the nose coming to rest about away from the initial point of impact, and the rest of it about farther down towards the runway and about from its edge and catching fire. Both pilots were killed. Investigation NTSB investigators examine the wreckage at the crash site The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) launched an investigation and sent a 26-member \\"go team\\" to the crash site to \\"collect perishable evidence\\". At a press conference held later on the same day, the NTSB said they had been unable to recover the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and the flight data recorder (FDR) as the tail section (where the recorders are housed) was still on fire. Both recorders were recovered on the following day, and were sent for analysis. At their third media briefing on August 16, 2013, the NTSB reported that the crew had briefed the approach to runway 18 and were cleared to land by air traffic control two minutes prior to the end of the recording. 16 seconds before the end of the recording, the aircraft's ground proximity warning system (GPWS) sounded two \\"sink rate\\" alerts, meaning that the aircraft was descending too rapidly. Three seconds later, Captain Beal reported having the runway in sight, which was confirmed by First Officer Fanning. The CVR recorded the sound of the first impact with trees 3 seconds after the pilots reported seeing the runway. A final \\"too low terrain\\" alert by the GPWS was then recorded, followed by the final sounds of impact. To represent the country of manufacture, the French aviation accident investigation agency BEA, assisted by Airbus technical advisors, participated in the investigation. Members of the FBI Evidence Response Team also assisted the NTSB. The NTSB stated in late August that no mechanical anomalies had yet been uncovered, but that the complete investigation would take several months. On February 20, 2014, the NTSB held a public hearing in connection with its investigation. Excerpts from the cockpit voice recorder were presented, in which both the captain and first officer discussed their lack of sufficient sleep prior to the flight. The same day, the entire CVR transcript was released. On September 9, 2014 the National Transportation Safety Board announced that the probable cause of the accident was that the aircrew had made an unstabilized approach into Birmingham‚ÄìShuttlesworth International Airport during which they failed to adequately monitor their altitude. The aircraft descended below the minimum descent altitude when the runway was not yet in sight, resulting in controlled flight into terrain approximately short of the runway threshold. The NTSB also found that contributing factors in the accident were: > #the flight crew's failure to properly configure and verify the flight > management computer for the profile approach; #the captain's failure to > communicate his intentions to the first officer once it became apparent the > vertical profile was not captured; #the flight crew's expectation that they > would break out of cloud at above ground level [due to incomplete weather > information]; #the first officer's failure to make the required minimums > callouts; #the captain's performance deficiencies, likely due to factors > including, but not limited to, fatigue, distraction, or confusion, > consistent with performance deficiencies exhibited during training, and; > #the first officer's fatigue due to acute sleep loss resulting from her > ineffective off-duty time management.  Aftermath  NTSB hearing, September 2014 In 2014, the Independent Pilots Association filed suit against the FAA to end the cargo airplane exemption from the flight crew minimum rest requirements. In 2016 the lawsuit was dismissed by a Washington, DC court, which determined the FAA had acted reasonably by excluding cargo airlines from the rest requirement based on a cost vs benefits analysis. Bret Fanning, husband of first officer Shanda Fanning, filed a lawsuit against Honeywell Aerospace in 2014, alleging that its ground proximity warning system installed on the A300 failed to alert the pilots that their aircraft was dangerously close to the ground. Fanning claimed that the GPWS did not sound an alarm until one second after the aircraft began to clip the tops of trees; however, the NTSB determined from the aircraft's flight data recorder that the GPWS sounded a \\"sink rate\\" warning when the aircraft was above the ground, 8 seconds before the first impact with trees.

Born in Glounthaune, County Cork, Murphy first played competitive hurling in his younger days. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Cork minor team, before later lining out with the under-21 side. He joined the senior panel and made his debut during the 2013 championship. At club level Murphy plays with Erin's Own and has won two championship medals. Playing career =Club= Murphy plays his club hurling with Erin's Own and has enjoyed some success. In 2006 Murphy was just seventeen years-old when he joined the club's senior team as a substitute. It was a successful year as Erin's Own reached the championship decider and faced Cloyne. Two vital scores from Kieran \\"Hero\\" Murphy and Brian Corcoran inspired the team after man of the match Eoghan Murphy kept them in touch throughout the first half with superb free-taking and popped up again with a vital goal in the second half. Murphy was introduced as a substitute in the second half and collected a Cork Senior Hurling Championship medal following a 2-19 to 3-14 victory. =University= During his tenure at University College Cork, Murphy played a key role for the university's various hurling teams. In 2012 he was a key member of the team when UCC reached the final of the Fitzgibbon Cup. Fierce local rivals Cork Institute of Technology provided the opposition, however, UCC claimed a thrilling extra-time success as they celebrated the centenary of the competition in style on home soil with a narrow 2-15 to 2-14 victory. It was Murphy's first Fitzgibbon Cup medal. In 2012-13 UCC reached the Fitzgibbon decider once again. Mary Immaculate College were the surprise opponents, however, tradition prevailed and UCC retained their title with a 2-17 to 2-12 victory. It was Murphy's second Fitzgibbon Cup medal. =Inter-county= Murphy first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Cork minor hurling team. He made his debut on 26 June 2007 in a Munster semi- final defeat of Clare. Cork lost the subsequent Munster decider to Tipperary, however, both sides faced each other in the subsequent All-Ireland decider. Cork took a four-point lead after the first eleven minutes, however, Tipp took control for the rest of the game and secured a 3-14 to 2-11 victory. In 2013 Murphy joined the Cork senior hurling panel. He was an unused substitute for Cork's championship campaign until the All-Ireland final replay on 28 September, when he was introduced as a substitute. The game itself was regarded as one of the best deciders in recent years. Clare's Shane O'Donnell was a late addition to the team, and went on to score a hat-trick of goals in the first nineteen minutes of the game. Horgan top scored for Cork, however, further goals from Conor McGrath and Darach Honan secured a 5-16 to 3-16 victory for Clare. On 3 April 2014 it was announced that Murphy had been dropped from Cork's championship panel.

He was the first president of the State Normal College for Colored Students, which eventually became Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University. Biography Tucker was born in Victoria in the Sherbro territory of British Sierra Leone. His mother was the daughter of Sherbro chief Harry Tucker while his father was said to be an Englishman or a French explorer. He attended the Mende Mission of the American Missionary Association, a school founded by American missionaries who accompanied the captives from the Amistad back to Africa. Missionary George Thompson brought 12-year-old Tucker to the United States. Two years later, Tucker enrolled in the preparatory program at Oberlin College. He graduated with his A.B. in 1865. During his time at Oberlin, he took a leave in 1862 to teach at the AMA's school for emancipated slaves at Fortress Monroe. Following his graduation he taught at schools in Georgetown, Kentucky and New Orleans, Louisiana. Tucker studied law at Straight University in New Orleans and graduated with his LL.B. in 1882. The following year he was admitted to the bar in Florida and opened a law partnership with J.D. Thompson in Pensacola, Florida. Tucker left his law practice and was appointed the first president of the State Normal College for Colored Students in 1887. The school opened for classes on October 3 in DeFuniak Springs, Florida. Thomas Van Renssalaer Gibbs, an African-American member of the Florida House of Representatives, became vice president of the school and essentially served as co-president with Tucker until his death in October 1898. Tucker presided over the school's relocation to Tallahassee, Florida, on property that was once the Highwood Plantation of Governor William Pope Duval and an infusion of funds thanks to the Second Morrill Act. Tucker's presidency came to an end as a result of conflicts with William N. Sheats, who became Superintendent of Public Instruction in 1893. Sheats was a racist and white supremacist and opponent of miscegenation and black political participation who was the namesake of the notorious 1895 Sheats Law enforcing strict racial segregation in schools, later ruled unconstitutional by the Fourth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida. But Sheats also supported black schools and was an admirer of Booker T. Washington's advocacy of agricultural and industrial education. Tucker, however, favored a liberal arts approach to education designed for public school teachers and, despite changing the name of the school to the State Normal and Industrial College for Colored Students, did not sufficiently emphasize the agricultural and industrial approach favored by Sheats. Gradually, Tucker's authority was reduced, expenditures and personnel decisions were disputed and investigated, and finally, he was ousted and replaced by Nathan B. Young in 1901.

Incumbent Democratic Governor Bill Clinton stood for re-election. He had been elected in 1982 and re-elected in 1984, and sought a third consecutive term and fourth overall (Clinton had been first elected in 1978). His opponent was former Republican Governor Frank D. White, who was seeking to return to the office he had defeated Clinton for in the 1980 election. After Amendment 63 to the Arkansas state constitution took effect, the term for all Arkansas governors was extended from two years to four. The 1986 election was the first to take place since then, meaning whoever managed to win would become the first elected to a four-year term as Governor of Arkansas. As of 2020, this is the last gubernatorial election in Arkansas in which the winner was not from the same party as the candidate who would win the presidential election 2 years later.

It is named after the country of Spain, whose government helped fund the project through the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation. The library is noted for its architecture. Its three buildings are meant to resemble black stones that are illuminated at night. In 2008, the library park won an award for best architecture of the year in the Ibero-American Architecture and Urban Design Biennial (IAUB) in Lisbon. The library was designed by Giancarlo Mazzanti, a Colombian architect who had previously designed another library park in the La Ladera neighborhood of Medell√≠n. Situated on a hillside above Medellin, the library can be reached by the Medell√≠n Metrocable at the Santo Domingo stop on Line K. Design commune of Medell√≠n. The library was designed by Giancarlo Mazzanti, an architect from Barranquilla who also designed the Le√≥n de Greiff Library in Colombia. It was completed in 2007 after the plans were approved in 2005. The construction area was 5,500 sqm with a final floor area of 3,727 sqm. The library construction cost approximately $4 million. The library consists of three interconnected buildings decorated on the outside with dark stone tiles. The three buildings each house different programs: the library, the training rooms, and the auditorium, which was donated by the Spanish government. The three buildings are connected by a platform. New footpaths and roads were also built nearby to connect the library to the neighborhood. The library was intentionally created with small windows, so that visitors could disconnect from the surrounding conditions of the neighborhood. History At the end of the 20th century, the northwest barrio of Santo Domingo, located in the 1st commune, was considered one of the most dangerous places in Latin America. As late as 2003, the people were not allowed to stay on the streets after 5 p.m. and the area was controlled at night by urban militias. The Northeast Integral Urban Project () was a city initiative to improve infrastructure in the poorest two zones in the north- west. A scheme for five Library parks was planned, the fourth one built and the most famous of which today is the Spain Library. The other libraries added as part of the city's education development program and redevelopment efforts included the Le√≥n de Greiff Library, San Javier Library, Bel√©n Library, and La Quintana Library. After the initial 2009 program another five libraries were added to the plan for 2011, for a total of ten library parks. The library was inaugurated on 24 March 2007 with a visit from the King and Queen of Spain, Juan Carlos I of Spain and Queen Sof√≠a of Spain. In 2013, the city government hired the National University of Colombia to conduct a study of the problems of the facade. In 2014, the study by the university was completed. The results said that damage corresponded to failures in the facade but not in structural core. This repair will cost around 11,000 million pesos.

The stone built hotel was originally constructed in 1887 before the 1893 Kalgoorlie gold rush for George Alfred Davies, a vintner, local councillor and Mayor of Fremantle. For most of its life it was known as the Oddfellows Hotel; it was renamed when it was substantially renovated in 1985. History The Oddfellows Hotel was constructed by 1877 for George Alfred Davies, who was a well known wine and spirit dealer. Davies had been born in Fremantle in 1846 to a family who had settled in Western Australia only five years after Captain Fremantle first claimed the area for Britain. After working for a number of years with his father, Albert, he established Grosvenor Cellars, selling alcoholic beverages and making his own wine. Davies was also active in public life, serving, in time, as a local councillor and in 1895 as the Mayor of Fremantle. The land where the hotel stands was where Davies was renting out cottages in 1880. Davies applied and received a title deed to all the land in 1884 and in 1887 the first record is seen of the stone-built hotel. The hotel was a successful business that survived George Davies' death in 1897. The hotel was put into a trust that was operated by his widow, Letty Davies, and brothers, George Davies and Arthur Elvin Davies. Derby Day in the Oddfellows Hotel garden in 1953 The building was internally redesigned around 1920 when the emphasis of the business changed from offering overnight accommodation to offering alcoholic drinks and hospitality. Shortly afterwards in 1922, the local brewery of Castlemaine Brewery purchased the building from the trustees. Within five years, the Oddfellows Hotel was being operated by the Swan Brewery as they \\"merged\\" with Castlemaine. The Swan brewery operated the hotel for over fifty years and a photo from the 1950s shows the building supporting tram lines on the corner of South Terrace and Norfolk Street.Oddfellows Hotel, South Terrace Fremantle, 3 April 1950, State Library of Western Australia, accessed 14 August 2013 The brewery sold the hotel in 1952 to the first of a long line of private owners and another picture shows the beer garden packed with revellers on Derby Day on 26 December 1953.Beer garden of Oddfellows Hotel, Fremantle on Derby Day, 26 December 1953, State Library of Western Australia, accessed 13 August 2013 Norfolk Hotel The hotel in 2009 Dame Dorothy Tangney DBE The Oddfellows Hotel was subject to major alterations just two years before its centenary, in preparation for the 1987 America's Cup Defence. In 1985 $500,000 was invested in renovating the building. A considerable part of the hotel was demolished and a small courtyard was created. The building still has two floors, a galvanised steel roof with a central feature chimney and a basement with its entrance from Norfolk Street. A retained feature are the wooden doors on the first floor through which loads could be hoisted. The building was sold for a reported one million Australian dollars to a micro brewery business, Brewtech Pty Ltd, who were the owners of the nearby Sail and Anchor Hotel. In 1987 Brewtech changed its name to the Matilda Bay Brewing Company, and in 1990 Matilda Bay was purchased by the Foster's Group. In 1989 the hotel lease was purchased by Garry Gosatti, one of the original partners behind the Matilda Bay Brewing Company. In 1992 the building was purchased by the Prendiville Group, whose portfolio includes Sandalford Winery, Karratha International Hotel, Cottesloe Beach Hotel and the Grand Hotel Townsville.Sister properties, sandalford.com, accessed 14 August 2013 In 2001 Gosatti renovated the basement of the hotel, converting it into a music venue; since early 2002 it has been used as an original music venue called \\"The Basement\\" and is now known as \\"Odd Fellows Bar\\". During the 2013 Fremantle Street Arts Festival the Norfolk Hotel was decorated with a wall sculpture of the first female Australian senator. The image of Dame Dorothy Tangney, DBE, was carved by the Portuguese artist Vhils (aka Alexander Farko) and his assistants.Vhils New Mural In Fremantle, Australia, Street Art News, 3 March 2013, accessed 15 August 2013 Vhils is known for digging into the surface to create his sculptures.Street Artist Vhils carves wall sculptures, khaleejesque.com, accessed 15 August 2013 Heritage value The building is listed on the City of Fremantle's municipal heritage list in September 2000. The basis for the listing is the building's association with George Davies and because this is an unusual stone built structure that dates from before the 1893 Kalgoorlie Gold Rush.

The name originates from watching goldfish in a bowl and using it as an analogy for channeling frustration and limitation. =Music= The first release on the new label was on 1 March 2007 and EP entitled Watching Clocks. This featured The Stranglers' drum technician Ian Barnard on drums and 300 copies were sold in limited edition CD format. Watching Clocks EP was the precursor to Foster's debut album, Media Ghost, which was released on 8 September 2008 in CD and digital download. Foster toured the UK promoting his album selling over 1000 CDs. The release did not chart as sales were not counted for that period. On 21 January 2010 The News Portsmouth published an article about Foster and a gig he was due to play at The Square Brewery, Petersfield. The article quoted Foster's review from Acoustic Magazine and outlined his plans for his second studio album. Foster's second album, The Garden, was released on 11 May 2010. In early 2013, the title track was remixed by Kassassin Street's Rowan Bastable, featuring Nathan Hill on percussion. This remix was mastered by Pete Maher, a producer for Beady Eye and U2. Foster was supported by Seahorses' Chris Helme at the launch of The Garden at the Half Moon, Putney. The art work for the album was created by American artist Helen Janow. On 6 March 2011, the album Panic Moon was released; along with an unofficial video for track 7 \\"Dark Astronaut\\". This homemade video was made by Foster himself and was based on the adventures of Morph and Doctor Who. On 8 March 2011, Foster featured in a studio session live on Pure FM playing tracks \\"Zombie Dance\\" and \\"Amy Watches the Stars\\" from Panic Moon. Foster and the Watchman played songs from Media Ghost, Panic Moon, The Garden and EP Watching Clocks in a show at The New Theatre Royal in Portsmouth on 4 December 2011. The show started with Neil Armstrong's Apollo 11 transmission playing and finished with a cover of the song \\"The Great Pretender\\" by The Platters. This was reviewed in the Portsmouth News. The show was recorded and sold on digital download format. To date this remains the only live album in Foster's catalogue. In 2012, the EP Russell's Teapot was released. The EP name is said to be inspired by Bertrand Russell and his analogy using the idea of a cosmic teapot. Russell wrote that the philosophic burden of proof lies upon a person making scientifically unfalsifiable claims rather than shifting the burden of proof to others, specifically in the case of religion. The first track of the EP, \\"Memory Maze\\", was played on BBC Radio 6 music on the BBC Introducing show. The second song, \\"I, Alone\\", includes vocals from Leonie Tremain, who sang the backing vocals on the Eva Cassidy album Somewhere. The EP New Criterion was released in September 2012. The cover art for this photograph, also entitled New Criterion, was taken by Aaron Bennett Photography and won an award from the National Photographic Society in 2013. In an article published by The News Portsmouth entitled \\"A Weekend with: Andrew Foster\\", Foster revealed a friendship with comedian Shappi Khorsandi and his love of Karl Pilkington, Downton Abbey, Doctor Who and Sherlock. The article also outlined Foster's favourite food to be Spaghetti Bolognese and favourite local day out to be at Kingley Vale in West Stoke Hampshire. Present Foster spent 2013 working with Beady Eye mastering engineer Pete Maher on his album Science and Magic, which is due for release in 2014. A limited edition EP sampler from Science and Magic was sold at Foster's gigs in early 2013.

Then Helmanis relocated to the capital of Russian Empire St Petersburg, where he started to work as a veterinary of the guard cavalry regiment. There he organised a laboratory by the dispensary and started to study clinical symptoms of glanders in horses and laboratory animals. When Louis Pasteur created a vaccine against rabies in 1886, Kristaps Helmanis devoted himself to research of rabies in St Petersburg and reported his results to the Duke Alexander Petrovich of Oldenburg, who supported his studies. Kristaps Helmanis himself paid a visit to Paris. Louis Pasteur sent two collaborators to St Petersburg in order to create a station, and the second Pasteur station in the Russian Empire administered by Helmanis was founded. At the Pasteur station he not only vaccinated bitten patients, but also tried to create diagnostic serums for tuberculosis, syphilis, smallpox and anthrax. He obtained diagnostic test for tuberculosis and informed Louis Pasteur about his discovery. On the same time Robert Koch at the Tenth International Medical Congress held 1890 in Berlin unexpectedly introduced a cure for tuberculosis, which he called tuberculin. In 1890 Kristaps Helmanis left the army service and joined newly founded Institute of Experimental Medicine in St Petersburg as the head of the division of epizootology.

Order to send men to the Philippines from Mexico, 14th June 1583 This event is a recorded battle between European regular soldiers against Japanese pirates. This unique event pitted musketeers, pikemen, rodeleros and sailors against mostly Japanese and Chinese pirates, mostly formed by r≈çnin, soldiers, fishermen, and merchants (both legitimate and smugglers).Contemporary Maritime Piracy: International Law, Strategy, and Diplomacy at Sea By James Kraska The pirates had a junk, and 18 sampans which are flat bottomed Chinese fishing wooden boat. The word \\"sampan\\" comes from the original Hokkien term for the boats, ‰∏âÊùø (sam pan), literally meaning \\"three planks\\".Merriam Webster online dictionary Prelude R≈çnin, or masterless samurai. Around 1573, the Japanese began to exchange gold for silver on the Philippine island of Luzon, especially in the provinces of Cagayan, Metro Manila, and Pangasinan, specifically the Lingayen area. In 1580, however, a ragtag group of pirates forced the natives of Cagayan into submission. These raiders were called Wokou. In response, the Governor-General of the Philippines Gonzalo Ronquillo commissioned Juan Pablo de Carri√≥n, hidalgo and a captain of the Spanish navy, to deal with the piracy. Ronquillo wrote to King Philip II on 16 June 1582:General Archive of the Indies, Philippines, file 6, bunch 2, number 56. Letter from Gonzalo Ronquillo, Governor of the Philippines to the King of Spain, 16th of June 1582Borao, Jos√© Eugenio (2005), p.2 Carri√≥n took the initiative and shelled a Wokou ship, possibly of Chinese manufacture, in the South China Sea, removing it from action. A retaliation came from Tay Fusa, who sailed toward the Philippine archipelago with a fleet. Opposing forces The Wokou fleet was composed of one junk and 18 sampans. Although their numbers were composed of Japanese, Chinese, and Philippine raiders, the name of their leader suggests the Japanese led their fleet. Spanish sources record it as Tay Fusa, which does not correspond to a Japanese name but could be a transliteration of Taifu- sama, with taifu (Â§ßÂ§´) being a word for a Japanese medieval chieftain, also pronounced as tƒÅi-hu in Hokkien Chinese, or d√†f≈´ in Mandarin Standard Chinese. They carried not only bladed weapons, but also muskets, which had been provided by the Portuguese. To counter this, Carri√≥n gathered forty soldiers and seven boats: five small support vessels, a light ship (San Yusepe), and a galley (La Capitana), with their respective crews.Borao, Jos√© Eugenio (2005), p.2 Though lesser in numbers, the Spanish were advantaged by their greater experience with firearms than the pirates, as well as the superior quality of their armor and weaponry.Del Rey, Canales, 2012 Some Chinese sources claim that the Japanese pirates were not very good at firing their muskets, which is believed to be due to a shortage of good powder. However, during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592‚Äì98), the Japanese musketeers had significant superiority in accuracy and range against Korean archers.A Korean minister who was there at many of the battles, Ryu Seong-ryong, wrote a book about the invasion known as the \\"Book of Corrections\\". After a short while a number of enemy soldiers suddenly emerged and started attacking us with ten or more muskets. The ones hit by the bullets were killed instantly. Yi immediately ordered the archers to counterattack using their bows, but their arrows fell far short of their target. Today, the Japanese exclusively use muskets to attack fortifications. They can reach [the target] from several hundred paces away. Our country‚Äôs bows and arrows cannot reach them. Battle Japanese sampan-like river boat. Dating from before 1886 are relatively flat bottomed Chinese wooden boat. As they passed the Bogueador cape, the Spanish flotilla encountered a heavy Wokou sampan. It had recently arrived at the coast and its sailors were abusing the native population. Carri√≥n, although outnumbered by the Wokou, engaged in naval battle with the sampan, eventually boarding it. The Spanish rodeleros then encountered armored Japanese Wokou wielding swords. Though initially successful, the Spanish soldiers were repelled back to their own ship, whose deck became a battlefield. Eventually the Spanish turned the battle again in their favor by improvising a parapet with Spanish pikemen at front and arquebusiers and musketeers at the rear, thanks to the well-timed reinforcement of the rest of the fleet. The Wokou abandoned the ships and swam away, with some of them drowning due to the weight of their armor. The Spanish had suffered their first casualties, among them the galley's captain Pero Lucas. The flotilla continued down the Cagay√°n River, finding a fleet of eighteen sampans and a Wokou fort erected inland. The Spanish fleet forced their way through using artillery and disembarked onshore. They dug in, assembling the artillery unloaded from the galley in the trenches, and continually bombarded the pirates. The Wokou decided to negotiate a surrender and Carri√≥n ordered them to leave Luzon. The pirates asked for gold in compensation for the losses they would suffer if they left, which was denied outright by Carri√≥n. After this, the Wokou decided to attack by land with a force of some six hundred strong. The Spanish trenches, manned by both soldiers and sailors, endured a first assault, then another. In response to their pikes being seized by the Wokou soldiers, the Spanish oiled the shafts of their pikes in order to make them difficult to grasp. The Spanish were running low on gun powder by the third attack, which became a close-quarters fight that almost breached the trenches. Finally, with the Wokou assaults diminishing, the Spanish emerged from the trenches and attacked, routing the remaining Wokou. They then plundered the Wokou weapons left on the battlefield, which included katanas and armor, and kept them as trophies. Aftermath With the region pacified, and the arrival of reinforcements, Carri√≥n founded the city of Nueva Segovia (now Lal-lo). Pirate activity was sparse afterwards, although the impression left by the fierceness of the battle led the local Spanish viceroy to request more troops. The commercial activity near Cagayan was focused in Lingayen Bay, in Pangasinan, on the port of Agoo and consisted principally of deerskin trade.General Archive of the Indies, Philippines, file 6, bunch 6, number 154.

English Heritage has listed the building at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance. History The Chequer Inn is timber-framed. The western half is a Crown post cross wing. The heavy sooting, seen on a plastered division within the roof is often an indication of a mediaeval open hall. Some decorative, combed plasterwork can also be seen. This part of the building was probably built in the 15th century, or possibly a little earlier. Over the years, apart from supplying accommodation and a change of horses for passenger or mail coaches, the Chequer Inn also acted as a court house, gaol, auction room, post office, coroner's inquest office, trading post and an important local meeting place. In the 19th Century, the Inn had eight bedchambers, ranging from gentlemen's rooms with curtained four-post beds to the drovers' quarters containing straw beds or palliasses. About six servants also lived in the inn. There was a 25-foot mahogany dining table in the first floor dining room where meals of mutton, beef, pigeon, and pheasant were served. Architecture The Chequer Inn has a white painted frontage comprising two splayed bays, which are timber framed and faced with mathematical tiles. The timbered, flat roofed main entrance canopy is supported by circular timber columns, built off a large Horsham stone step. Evenly spaced sash windows and a parapet complete the main frontage. Behind the parapet is a wide back gutter serving the large hipped roof of plain tiles, and two brick chimneys. To the rear there are three pitched roof wings, connected at their bases by wide valley boards. The building is an example of a triple bay oak timber-framed building having ‚Äúdaub and wattle‚Äù interior walling fitted within the oak timber frame. Only the North wing (Saloon Bar and Dining Room) of the building still retains the oak framing and original features on the ground floor. Many of the older timber-framed walls are visible upstairs. A carriage entrance was created, probably in the 17th century, by removing the north-west ground floor of room 39 and raising the first floor. This was needed because the Chequer Inn was a coaching inn and posting house with stabling for about a dozen horses, and there would have been a busy traffic in and out of this entrance. A separate Ostlers Cottage and a horse stable block stand at the back of the Inn. The Inn's timber-framed street frontage was destroyed when the Inn was enlarged in 1799. The addition provided extra rooms, and a brick front in keeping with 18th century fashion. The then tenant, John Stoveld the Younger, a Steyning brewer, was presented at the Manor Court of Charlton for contravention of local planning laws, in that he \\"made an encroachment on the High Street‚Ä¶ Causing the Checker Inn, which hath in a great measure been rebuilt, to be brought considerably forward into the High Street.\\"West Sussex Record Office, Wiston MS. 5200 He was fined six shillings and eight pence (6s 8d) for this misdemeanor, but got away with the rebuilding. By the end of the 18th century a Saloon was added; this was a room where for an admission fee or a higher price of drinks, singing, dancing, drama or comedy was performed and drinks would be served at the table. The stable yard is now a car park; at one time the town fire engine was housed there. =Checker sign and light= In 1393 King Richard II created a law stating that \\"Whosoever shall brew ale in the town with intention of selling it must hang out a sign, otherwise he shall forfeit his ale.\\" This was to make alehouses easily visible to passing inspectors, borough ale tasters, who would decide the quality of the ale they provided. The signs were illustrated so as to be identifiable to the mostly illiterate population. The name \\"The Checkers\\" or \\"The Chequers\\" originated from the design on the pub's sign; the design originated in ancient Rome, where a chequer board indicated that a bar also provided banking services. The checked board was used as an aid to counting and is the origin of the word exchequer. In the 17th-century, ale houses and inns were required to hang out lanterns to help illuminate the street. In Steyning the hook at the end of the Chequer sign bracket was used to support the town lamp. The lamp was missing for many years but was found & restored by the then landlord, Colin Garlic. A few years ago, before the Steyning bypass was built, the lamp was smashed by an over-laden timber lorry passing through the High Street. Local resident Alan Rogerson refurbished the lamp and it was restored to its rightful place. Historic references In 1653 the poet, John Taylor, who had travelled from Petworth to Steyning, wrote: > :August the 18, twelve long miles to Steyning :I rode, and nothing saw there > worth the Kenning. :But that mine host there was a jovial Wight. :My Hostess > fat and fair, a goodly sight: :The sign, the Chequer, eighteen pence to pay. > :My mare eat mortal meat, good Oats and Hay.Caldecott, J.B.

Curtis Dohan, Jr. Francis Curtis Dohan (March 24, 1907‚ÄîNovember 9, 1991) was an American research physician and endocrinologist. F. Curtis Dohan, M.D. in 1945 F. Curtis Dohan, M.D. in 1959 Life and education Dohan was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His father was William Henry Dohan. His mother was Elizabeth Rees (Repplier) Dohan. Dohan attended Haverford College before matriculating into the School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) in Philadelphia. Upon graduation in 1932 he began a rotating internship at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, after which he completed fellowship training in endocrinology with Fuller Albright at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Medical career In 1935 Dohan returned to Penn to work at the Cox Medical Research Institute (Cox), where he collaborated with Francis D.W. Lukens, MD. During World War II Dohan joined the US Army Air Corps and served as a flight surgeon in Africa. In 1946 he returned to Cox, and he served on the faculty at Penn for many years. Concurrently he held the position of Medical Director at Radio Corporation of America (RCA), through which he supervised the medical care of employees at RCA plants all over the United States. This position allowed him to collect medical data over decades and analyze it epidemiologically. Medical research As a medical researcher Dohan published many scientific articles, and he made significant contributions in the areas of whiplash injuries following car crashes, respiratory illness following exposure to air pollutants, and the appropriate duration of in-hospital convalescence following surgery. Some of his most interesting and challenging research involved the occasional association of schizophrenia with celiac disease. His work enticed many of his contemporaries to follow the genetic and metabolic nuances of this association in hope that a better understanding might lead to the prevention of many cases of schizophrenia. Definitive answers remained elusive, yet in the 21st century this association has continued to fascinate and motivate medical researchers. References 1\\\\. Dr. F.

It is found on Cyprus and in Greece and the Near East. It is an important pest in cereal grain fields in some areas. Taxonomy It was first described in 1855 by Julius Lederer as Oecophora temperatella, from two males collected by Franz Zach in Beirut in Lebanon. These are the syntypes. The first female was collected in Palestine as a single specimen and described as a different species, O. fuscofasciata, by Henry Tibbats Stainton in his Tineina of Syria and Asia Minor of 1867. Stainton also mentions examining and coming across specimens of O. temperatella from Palestine, and that he was \\"strongly disposed to think that this is the female of O. temperatella\\". A rather damaged female specimen collected in \\"Smyrna\\" (Izmir), Turkey, was described as the synonym Butalis ochrolitella by Otto Staudinger in 1871. Staudinger also mentions that the specimen might be the female counterpart to Lederer's Oecophora temperatella. The species was moved to the monotypic genus Syringopais by Erich Martin Hering in 1919. Hering synonymised Butalis ochrolitella and Oecophora fuscofasciata with Syringopais temperatella in the same paper. Edward Meyrick then re-described the same species as the synonym Nochelodes xenicopa in 1920 from a single male specimen collected in Nazareth, Palestine, by Barraud in April. It has been classified in the genus Scythris as S. temperatella before the 1920s, at least in German sources. In the early 1920s it was also known as Nochelodes temperatella in Cyprus, at least in British sources. =Etymology= Lederer does not state why he chose the specific epithet \\"temperatella\\". =Intergeneric classification= Meyrick included it in the Oecophoridae in 1920 (as Nochelodes xenicopa). In 1999 Ronald W. Hodges was the first to classify this moth in its own monotypic subfamily, the Syringopainae, which he classified in the family Deoclonidae. In Zhi-Qiang Zhang's 2011 attempt to number all the known animal species of Earth, van Nieukerken et al., the authors of the section on Lepidoptera, recognised the Syringopaidae as an independent, monotypic family within the Gelechioidea superfamily. It has also been placed in the Gelechiidae (in 2013), as well as the subfamily Deocloninae of the family Autostichidae. In 2014 the moth was placed in the subfamily Syringopainae of the family Pterolonchidae following a cladistics analysis by Heikkil√§ et al. Description The species is sexually dimorphic. The male is decidedly larger than the female, especially regarding wingspan. The length of the body is 12-15mm. The fore-wings are shiny greenish-yellow and the hind-wings are ash-grey. The head and back of the abdomen are brownish-yellow. There are appressed scales on the head. The tongue is developed. The labial palpi are long, curved upwards, slender, with smooth scales on the second joint, and the last segment almost as long as the second, and ending in an acute point, while the maxillary palpi are very short, thread-like and appressed to the tongue. The larvae, or caterpillars, are pale or yellow-pink with a dark brown head, and covered with many tubercles. They grow to 10mm. =Similar species= In his original description, Lederer compares it to Crassa tinctella, of which it is about the same size. In his re-analysis Hering compares it to Scythris cuspidella, considering the genus Scythris the most closely resembling group to this odd moth, but remarks on the very different wing venation, the fore-wings having more and more pronounced veins, the hind-wings somewhat less but more pronounced veins, as well as differences in the genitalia. Meyrick mentions a resemblance to the genus Promalactis. The adults can be found with similar moths in the genus Pleurota in May in Turkey, but are said to be easily distinguished by the \\"naked and curved palpus labialis\\". Distribution It is found in the European Union on Cyprus and in Greece, and it is also found in Asia in the Near East in southern Turkey, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Lorestan in Iran, Iraq (both in lowlands as well as highlands), Jordan and perhaps elsewhere. Ecology The larvae feed on Hordeum, barley, and Triticum, wheat, species. It has also been found more rarely on oats, Avena sativa. They are thought to likely be native to grassy places in degraded oak woodland habitat, and mountain steppe in rocky places, but to have adapted to human grain fields over the ages. The caterpillars mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine starts at the leaf-tip, and may occupy the entire width of the blade. Most frass is deposited in the lower part of the mine. After hatching in the early summer, the young larvae feed for a while before entering the soil, spinning a special cocoon called a \\"cyst\\", and entering summer diapause. Mining larvae can be found in winter and early spring. Pupation and overwintering takes place in the soil. The imagoes, the adults, have a very weak flight ability, and flutter low among the grasses. They are active day and night in May in southern Turkey. Adult moths are active from late spring to early summer in Cyprus. The males have been observed feeding diurnally on the nectar of clover, Trifolium, flowers. Both males and females have been observed on clover in Israel, with four times as many females appearing than males. There is a single annual generation. The eggs are laid in the soil before the heat of summer, with females laying 50-120 eggs each on or in the soil. =Parasitoids= A number of parasitoids have recently been recorded from this species, from southeast Turkey Habrobracon stabilis and a species of Apanteles, and the eulophid wasps Diglyphus chabrias, Necremnus tidius and Sympiesis euspilapterygis from Lorestan in Iran. In Israel caterpillars collected in a field of durum wheat were reared in the laboratory and the following parasitoids were all raised from them: Eulophidae (Cirrospilus vittatus, Diglyphus chabrias, D. isaea, D. sensilis, D. pusztensis, Necremnus tidius, Neochrysocharis formosus, Pnigalio gyamiensis, P. pectinicornis), Pteromalidae (Norbanus sp.), Braconidae (Habrobracon stabilis, Apanteles sp.); and Ichneumonidae (Campoplex sp.). In all of these species the parasitoids emerged significantly earlier than the moths. Most species of ectoparasitoids hatched ahead of the endoparasitoids. Male moths emerge slightly earlier from their cocoons than the females, and are significantly more often infected, with a higher mortality. Parasitoids may cause up to 50% mortality in the moth population. Uses These moths are important pests of cereals in Cyprus, Turkey, Jordan and elsewhere. In 2013 in Jordan, Al-Zyoud states that the \\"pest has been recognized since 2001 as the most destructive insect pest limiting the production of wheat and barley\\". It was a major agricultural pest in Cyprus in the mid-1920s, when \\"sometimes whole areas of wheat are virtually destroyed\\". It remained a pest in Cyrus in the 1970s. In Turkey crop losses of up to 60% have been reported, and higher in Jordan. It is also reported as a pest in Lorestan in Iran, and in Iraq in the 1950s. Drought years cause worse damage from this pest. Insecticides were considered the most effective control method (in Cyprus in 1977) provided the timing of the spraying was carried out at the right times in the development of the insect. Organophosphates are the most effective to date, destroying 90-100% of the pest when applied early. In some countries the moth has begun to develop a resistance to some pesticides. Mechanical methods of control are deep ploughing to 40 cm to expose the cocoons, crop rotation with legumes, burning crop stubble and leaving the soil fallow for at least two years. Some research has gone into biological control. Trials with formulations containing the insecticidal bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis have shown up to 80% reduction of the infestation in wheat in Jordan. Several strains of barley appear resistant, and there is some breeding being done in various countries to explore this trait.

The episode was written by series co-creator Brad Falchuk and directed by Bradley Buecker, and first aired on September 26, 2013 on Fox in the United States. The episode was the first of two tribute episodes to the Beatles. It features the marriage proposal by Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss) to Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), the revelation of Rachel Berry's (Lea Michele) future on Broadway, the official dating of Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) and Kitty Wilde (Becca Tobin), and the return of Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) to Mckinley High School as the new principal. Two special guest stars debut on the show: Peter Facinelli as Rupert Campion, the Funny Girl director and Ioan Gruffudd as Paolo San Pablo, the Funny Girl lead actor. The episode received mixed to positive reviews, with many critics highlighting Blaine and Kurt's storyline and the episode's ending scene. Upon its initial airing, this episode was viewed by 5.06 million American viewers and garnered a 2.0/5 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 age group. The total viewership and ratings for this episode were down slightly from the previous episode, \\"All or Nothing\\". An album was released on September 24, 2013 to coincide with the premiere of the episode, which features music from this episode and the episode \\"Tina in the Sky with Diamonds\\". The album, Glee Sings the Beatles, has received generally positive reviews from critics. Plot In New York City, Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) attends a chemistry reading for Funny Girl, but it is brief and she later hears the director and leading man worry that she's too young, and sings \\"Yesterday\\" in frustration. She begins working as a waitress in a singing Broadway diner with Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) in order to make ends meet and gain life experience. The Funny Girl director and actor show up one day, and Rachel seizes a second chance to impress them by singing \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" with Santana. Glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) gives New Directions a two-week assignment covering the Beatles, with the first week focusing on their early years. Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) serenades Kitty Wilde (Becca Tobin) with \\"Drive My Car\\" and invites her to a carnival. They are seen together by a new cheerleader, Bree (Erinn Westbrook), who Kitty realizes is trying to sabotage her. She then asks Artie to keep their relationship a secret to preserve her popularity, which he reluctantly agrees to. Their relationship blossoms, though there are problems, as revealed in a further performance, this of \\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\\". When Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) finds out about Artie and Kitty's relationship, she attempts to convince Artie to go public with the relationship, but he refuses. She later reveals to the glee club that the two are dating, and Kitty agrees that she and Artie should now publicly be a couple. Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) is free to return to McKinley High, as Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter) has confessed that she had brought the gun to school that went off accidentally, and Sue lied to protect her. Sue frames Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) by planting pornography and other unsuitable material in his office, where it is discovered by the authorities. Figgins is then demoted to janitor, while Sue is brought in to replace him as interim principal, and schemes to be given the job permanently. She informs Will and Roz Washington (NeNe Leakes), Sue's replacement as coach of the Cheerios, that they must win Nationals competitions in show choir and cheerleading, respectively, or be fired. Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) and Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss) rekindle their relationship with a performance of \\"Got to Get You into My Life\\", and Blaine decides to move forward with his plan to propose to Kurt. He and Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) rally New Directions, Vocal Adrenaline, the Dalton Academy Warblers and the Haverbrook Deaf Choir to participate in Blaine's proposal through a performance of \\"Help!\\". Blaine becomes concerned by Tina's bitterness and recruits Sam, Jake Puckerman (Jacob Artist) and Ryder Lynn (Blake Jenner) to cheer her up through a performance of \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\". Tina is then given the opportunity to choose Blaine, Sam or Ryder as her date for prom, and selects Sam. Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley) is supposedly driving Kurt to the airport, but Kurt reveals he knows he's really being driven to hear Blaine's proposal and doesn't know what to do. Burt tells him to balance the pros and the cons, and always remember that life is short. They arrive at Dalton Academy, where Blaine serenades Kurt with \\"All You Need Is Love\\", accompanied by the four glee clubs, and with Rachel, Santana, Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) and Burt in attendance. Blaine then proposes in the spot where the two first met, and Kurt says yes. Production The season's production was set to begin in mid-July, with shooting commencing July 29, 2013. After actor Cory Monteith's death, it was announced the show would be going on a short hiatus while its writers and producers figured out how to proceed, and how to adjust the season's planned storylines given the absence of Finn Hudson, Monteith's role. On July 19, 2013, Glee announced through their official Facebook fan page that the season premiere would air on September 26, one week after the original date, and filming would begin in early August. The season ultimately began shooting on August 5, 2013, a week later than originally planned, though studio recording and costume fittings for the cast began four days earlier. Location shooting for the episode took place in New York City on September 9 and 10, 2013; both Ryan Murphy and Lea Michele tweeted photos from the shoot. According to co-creator Murphy, the first two episodes of the fifth season had been written in May 2013, and would be tribute episodes to the Beatles. The Beatles tribute had been in the works for four years. This first episode was written by co-creator Brad Falchuk, and directed by executive producer Bradley Buecker. This is the first episode that the actors playing the roles of Jake Puckerman (Jacob Artist), Marley Rose (Melissa Benoist), Kitty Wilde (Becca Tobin), Wade \\"Unique\\" Adams (Alex Newell) and Ryder Lynn (Blake Jenner) have been given main cast credits. All five were first reported as being promoted to the main cast at the end of June 2013. Two new special guest stars appeared in the episode in New York sequences. Peter Facinelli played the Funny Girl director, Rupert Campion, and Ioan Gruffudd the lead male actor in the show, Paolo San Pablo. Erinn Westbrook debuts as a new recurring McKinley cheerleader, Bree, who is said to be a \\"mean girl\\". Other recurring characters in this episode include former glee club member Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), Kurt's father Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley), cheerleading coach Roz Washington (NeNe Leakes), Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba), Haverbrook School for the Deaf choir director Dalton Rumba (Michael Hitchcock), and Dalton Academy Warbler Sebastian Smythe (Grant Gustin). Eight of the Beatles songs appear on this episode: \\"Yesterday\\", sung by Michele; \\"Drive My Car\\", sung by McHale and Tobin; \\"Got to Get You into My Life\\", performed by Criss and Colfer; \\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\\", also performed by Tobin and McHale; \\"Help!\\", sung by Criss and Overstreet; \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", performed by Michele and Rivera; \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\", performed by Criss, Overstreet, Artist and Jenner; and \\"All You Need Is Love\\", performed by Criss. The songs from this episode and the next one have been released on the album Glee Sings the Beatles, which contains fourteen songs by the Glee cast originally written and performed by the Beatles. The album was made available for pre-order on iTunes on September 10, 2013, and was released on September 24, 2013, two days before the season premiere. Reception =Ratings= \\"Love, Love, Love\\" was first broadcast on September 26, 2013 in the United States. It garnered a 2.0/5 Nielsen rating/share and received 5.06 million American viewers during its initial airing. Viewership and ratings were down slightly from those of the previous episode, \\"All or Nothing\\", which was watched by 5.92 million American viewers and acquired a 2.0/6 rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic upon first airing. In Canada, the episode was watched by 1.025 million viewers. =Critical response= \\"Love, Love, Love\\" was given mixed to positive reviews by critics. Miranda Wicker of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 3.5 out of 5, saying the episode \\"was a technicolor return for the series, full of fun music for the audience to keep the audience singing along. But Finn Hudson's absence is evident.\\" She commented negatively on the season's time-jump, saying \\"[it] robbed the audience of some good moments,\\" but commented positively on Blaine's proposal speech, calling it \\"beautiful.\\" Lauren Hoffman of Vulture gave the episode a 4 out of 5, saying \\" it was a strong hour of Glee: fun, vibrant, and (against all odds) aware of continuity and character development. And if some of the vocal arrangements felt too derivative, well, then, at least they were derivative of the Beatles, and everyone likes the Beatles.\\" Also, in regards to Finn's absence, she said \\"it was surreal (and maybe even the tiniest bit morbid) to watch the New Directions kids ride around on bumper cars and dance through confetti and jump on tabletops knowing that Finn is never coming back. The show didn‚Äôt reference him at all last night, and likely won‚Äôt mention him again until the October 10th episode, which will be an hour- long tribute to both Finn and Cory Monteith. I understand the practical and emotional concerns that kept Glee from addressing his death at the outset of the season, but it was jarring to get absorbed in last night‚Äôs episode and then suddenly remember why Finn wasn‚Äôt there.\\" The Associated Press noted how the premiere offered \\"a subtle, sad reminder of the late Glee star Cory Monteith\\" in the scene where Rachel \\"gaze[s] at a photo on her cellphone: It's a group shot of her old high school glee club pals, among them Monteith's Finn Hudson.\\" Katy Kroll of Rolling Stone also made note of Cory's absence, saying \\"Try as the show might, the July 13th death of Cory Monteith at age 31 of a drug overdose left a dark cloud hanging over the Season Five premiere ‚Äì no matter what the show's stars and producers were hoping we'd see;\\" she then reacted positively to Blaine and Kurt's storyline, calling it \\"cuter than cute.\\" Laurel Brown of Zap2it said for the engagement scene, the writers \\"went all-out on this one, didn't they? One should not be touched by the beautiful proposal of a teenaged boy. But oh, is it touching! We'll allow it.\\" Beth Douglass of Wetpaint gave the episode a more mixed review, specifically about the episode's theme, saying \\"the New Directions do a lot of really cool stuff‚Äîlike dress up as the Beatles, run around a carnival, etc.‚Äîall of which we meet with only moderate interest. Don‚Äôt get us wrong. We love them. It‚Äôs just that all of this pales in comparison to the mind-blowing romantic epicness that is about to go down,\\" referring to Blaine and Kurt's storyline, which she commented positively on, saying \\"it's the most wonderful, beautiful, perfect proposal we‚Äôve ever seen in our entire lives.\\" Finally, she noted \\"though this season will no doubt have its painful and emotional moments, there is plenty of hope and happiness in store this season.\\" Brandon Nowalk of The A.V. Club also gave the episode a mixed review, grading it a C+. He commented that the episode \\"isn‚Äôt much of an episode, much less a premiere, but it‚Äôs one hell of an antacid.\\" Rae Votta of Billboard also gave the episode a mixed review, and wrote that > Glee is now a completely different show from whatever creator Ryan Murphy > intended, for better or for worse. It had to come back sometime, and instead > of pulling off the bandage of grief upfront, Glee gave themselves a soft > landing with a two-part season opener focused on the music of The Fab Four. > While Glee has dabbled in the Beatles before, the hyper-focus special > episode format keeps us feeling familiar, safe and generally upbeat as we > transition into the brand new Glee world. Music An album was released on September 24, 2013 to coincide with the premiere of the episode, which features music from this episode and the episode \\"Tina in the Sky with Diamonds.\\" =Commentary= The album, Glee Sings the Beatles, has received generally positive reviews from critics. Heather Phares of Allmusic wrote: \\"The July 2013 death of Cory Monteith, cast a pall on the beginning of Glee's fifth season\\", then she added that two of the album's songs, concretely \\"Yesterday\\" and \\"Let It Be (song)\\" were \\"bookended versions of the Fab Four's cheerier fare with subdued renditions of two of the band's most poignant songs\\". Phares also commented positively on how \\"[the album] could have left the cast's women stuck on the sidelines as screaming Beatlemaniacs, [but instead] it had the ladies front and center [on songs] like the sweet rendition of \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and the playful take on \\"A Hard Day's Night\\". She then calls the album as \\"a promising start to season five's music\\".

Ataga Khan was murdered by Adham Khan, the jealous son of Maham Anga, also one of Akbar's wet-nurses in 1562. Thereafter, Aziz Koka built his father's tomb next to Nizamuddin Auliya in Delhi in 1566-67. Adham Khan on the other hand, was executed by the orders of Akbar. After Akbar conquered Gujarat, he made Aziz Koka the governor of the new province. In 1573, the Gujaratis rebelled and besieged Aziz Koka in Ahmedabad. But he defended the city until Akbar's army came to his relieve. In 1579, he was made governor of Bihar and ordered to quell a rebellion in Bengal. however, he did not take action until the next year, when the rebels began to take Bihar as well. He was similarly reluctant when ordered to conquests in the Deccan in 1586. Akbar was very lenient to Aziz Koka, his foster-brother and childhood playmate. Nevertheless, Aziz Koka did not obey Akbar, his emperor, readily. He was especially opposed to Akbar's law to brand all horses, and could not accept prostration in Akbar's new court ritual. When Aziz Koka was summoned to court in 1592, he went on pilgrimage to Mecca instead. There he spent much money to pious causes for a year and a half, until Akbar forgave him, and restored him in his positions.NawwƒÅb ·π¢am·π£ƒÅmuddaula ShƒÅh NawƒÅz KhƒÅn and ‚ÄòAbdul ·∏§ayy: The MaƒÅthir ul-UmarƒÅ, translated into English by H.

Khusrau's rebellion was crushed in 1606. He was first blinded and later executed. Though Jahangir never found any directed evidence against Man Singh and Aziz Koka to have them executed, he however took away much of their powers, and chided them in the Jahangirnama. Later in life, Aziz Koka regained his position, but his clan could never regain the royal patronage, as they enjoyed during his father's lifetime.Faruqui, p. 227 His daughter, Habiba Banu Begum was married to the fourth son of Akbar, Mughal prince Sultan Murad Mirza in 1587; and had two sons, Rustam Mirza (b. 1588) and Alam Mirza (b. 1590).

Work on the foundation began in 1617 and the structure was built on a series of arches which overtopped and closed off the old Gorge of Zanguna (Quebrada de Sangu√±a or Zangu√±a). The fa√ßade was completed in 1706 and the remainder of the building in 1715. Between 1731 and 1747 the altarpieces of the interior were emplaced.

The Delta made its first flight after eight years of development. The Delta has a standard pod and boom layout, the latter high set, slender and braced with a narrow angle V-form strut pair to its halfway point from bottom of the pod. It has a short span tailplane with small endplate fins raised above the boom on a swept, high aspect ratio fin, forming a T-tail.

The pod seats two side-by-side behind a full clear forward transparency. Its skin is carbon fibre over a titanium alloy tube frame. Tandem controls are fitted, with two sets of anti-torque pedals and a T-shaped cyclic control centrally mounted on a console; the single collective pitch lever is placed between the seats. A governor sets the throttle in the absence of pilot input and trim is applied electrically. Small baggage can be stored in under seat lockers.

The incident attracted national and international media attention and brought increased scrutiny to the status of LGBT rights in Jamaica. Perceived as effeminate, Jones was bullied in school and, at the age of 14, was forced out of his family home by his father. He moved into a derelict house in Montego Bay with transgender friends. On the evening of 21 July 2013, they went to the Irwin area of the city and attended a dance party. When some men at the party discovered that the cross-dressing Jones was not a woman, they confronted and attacked him. Jones was beaten, stabbed, shot, and run over with a car; he died in the early hours of the morning. Police investigated the murder but did not arrest or charge anyone for the crime, which remains unsolved. The event made newspaper headlines in Jamaica and was also the subject of reporting in both the United Kingdom and the United States. While voices on social media accused Jones of provoking his killers by cross-dressing in public, the murder was condemned by Jamaican educators and the country's Justice Minister. In the wake of the attack, both domestic and international organisations devoted to LGBT rights and human rights ‚Äì among them Human Rights Watch, Jamaicans for Justice, and the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals & Gays ‚Äì asked the Jamaican authorities for a proper investigation and legal recognition of LGBT rights on the island. Background =Jones' biography= View of Montego Bay from the hillside, where Jones was squatting Raised in an impoverished slum in Montego Bay, a city in northwest Jamaica, Jones faced bullying at high school from students who perceived his behaviour as effeminate. When Jones was 14, his father ejected him from the family home and encouraged neighbours to chase him out of the neighbourhood. After a period sleeping in bushes and on beaches, he began squatting in a derelict house in the hills above Montego Bay with two transgender friends, Keke and Khloe, both 23 at the time of Jones' death. Jones was known among friends as \\"Gully Queen\\", a reference to the storm drainage systems in which many homeless LGBT Jamaicans live. Friends noted that Jones desired to become a teacher or to work in the tourist industry. He also wanted to become a performer like the American pop star Lady Gaga, and had won a local dancing competition. Khloe described him as \\"a diva\\" who was \\"always very feisty and joking around\\". =Anti-LGBT sentiment in Jamaica= In 2006, Time magazine said that Jamaica may be the most homophobic country in the world. The country's laws criminalising same-sex activity between males were introduced in 1864, during the British colonial administration. According to the Sexual Offences Act of 2009, any man convicted under these laws must register as a sex offender. These laws have been cited as contributing to wider homophobic attitudes among the Jamaican populace, including the view that gay people are criminals regardless of whether or not they have committed any criminal act. Anti-LGBT perspectives have been furthered by the island's conservative Christian churches. Many reggae and dancehall songs, among them Buju Banton's \\"Boom Bye Bye\\", call for the killing of gays. Writing for the International Business Times in the summer of 2013, the journalist Palash Gosh noted that while Jamaica was \\"awash in crime and violence, gays and lesbians are particularly prominent targets of wanton brutality.\\" In the mid-2000s, two of Jamaica's best-known LGBT rights activists, Brian Williamson and Steve Harvey, were murdered. In the summer of 2013, Human Rights Watch carried out five weeks of fieldwork among Jamaica's LGBT community, reporting that over half of those interviewed had experienced violence as a result of their sexual orientation or gender identity, sometimes on more than one occasion. Murder On the evening of 21 July 2013 ‚Äì when Jones was 16 ‚Äì he dressed in female clothing and attended a dance party with Keke and Khloe called Henessey Sundays, held at a bar in the Irwin area. They arrived by taxi at around 2 am. Jones passed as a girl at the party, and several males danced with him. Although he initially kept his biological sex a secret from others at the party, fearing homophobic persecution, he revealed his identity to a girl with whom he had previously been to church. The girl informed her male friends, who accosted him outside the venue, demanding to know, \\"Are you a woman or a man?\\" One of the men used a lantern to examine Jones' feet, claiming that they were too large to be those of a biological woman. Discovering his sex, they started calling him \\"batty boy\\" and other homophobic epithets. Khloe tried to get him to avoid confrontation, whispering in his ear, \\"Walk with me, walk with me\\", but Jones refused, instead insisting to those assembled that he was female. When someone pulled on Jones' bra strap, he ran away, and the crowd pursued and attacked him further down the road. He was beaten, stabbed, shot and run over by a car. He slipped in and out of consciousness for two hours before another attack finally killed him. There were no reports of anyone trying to help him during the altercation. Khloe was also attacked and almost raped, but escaped by hiding first in a church and then in neighbouring woods. Khloe commented, \\"When I saw Dwayne's body, I started shaking and crying. It was horrible.\\" Police arrived at the scene at 5 am to find the body dumped in bushes along Orange Main Road. They launched an investigation into the homicide, inviting friends and family of the victim to contact them. Jones' family declined to claim the body, and his father refused to talk to the press about the incident. On 14 August, Deputy Superintendent of Police Steve Brown announced that fourteen statements had been collected and that the investigation was progressing. In October 2013, a group of men set fire to the place in which Jones had lived as a squatter, forcing its four occupants to flee, in what was also believed to be an anti-LGBT hate crime. Everald Morgan, an officer at the St James Public Health Department, requested that police provide protection for the four youths made homeless by the arson attack, but they declined to do so. Meanwhile, a charity named Dwayne's House was set up in Jones' memory to aid homeless LGBT youth in Jamaica. , however, no one had been arrested or charged, and in August 2015 the crime was still considered unsolved. Reaction =In Jamaica= Jones' murder made headline news across Jamaica. Jamaica's Justice Minister, Senator Mark Golding, condemned the killing and called for an end to \\"depraved acts of violence\\" in Jamaica. He added that \\"all well-thinking Jamaicans\\" should embrace \\"the principle of respect for the basic human rights of all persons\\" and express tolerance towards minority groups such as the LGBT community. Annie Paul, the publications officer of the Jamaican campus of the University of the West Indies (UWI), stated that on the basis of comments provided on social media, she thought that most Jamaicans believed that Jones provoked his own murder by cross-dressing within a society that did not tolerate such behaviour. Newton D. Duncan, the UWI Professor of Paediatric Surgery, similarly noted that the \\"overwhelming majority\\" of Jamaicans believed that cross-dressers are homosexuals and deserve punishment. He added that this was a common misconception, because the majority of cross-dressers were heterosexual. He condemned the attack and compared it to the lynching of an African-American man in Harper Lee's novel To Kill a Mockingbird, drawing links between the anti-LGBT violence of Jamaica and the anti-black violence of the mid-20th century United States. Domestic and foreign human rights organisations called on then Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller to improve LGBT rights in Jamaica, as she had promised during her election campaign. Writing in the Jamaican broadsheet The Gleaner, Carolyn Cooper, Professor of Literary and Cultural Studies at UWI, condemned the group who committed Jones' murder. She blamed their behaviour on the selective use of the Bible, noting that while many Jamaicans embrace those Biblical passages which condemn same-sex sexual activity and cross-dressing, they are themselves typically guilty of many other Biblical sins, such as adultery and murder. She commented that Jones had been killed just for being himself and expressed the hope that his killers face legal prosecution for their crime. The following week she published a follow-up article in which she responded to several emails that she had received which claimed that the real victims of the scenario were the men whom Jones deceived when he was dancing with them. She reiterated her condemnation of Jones' killers, remarking that rather than retaliating violently, they should have brushed it off with a humorous comment. Jaevion Nelson, an HIV/AIDS campaigner and human rights advocate, also published an article on the subject in The Gleaner. He noted that his initial reaction was to question why Jones had gone to the dance party and why he was not satisfied in attending Jamaica's underground gay parties. He added that he had subsequently realised that adopting this viewpoint was rooted in \\"the culture of violence\\" by which a victim is blamed for what happened to them. He called on Jamaicans to be tolerant of LGBT individuals, and to focus on \\"rebuilding this great nation on the principles of inclusivity, love, equality and respect with no distinctions whatsoever\\". Also in The Gleaner, Sheila Vel√©z Mart√≠nez, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh, condemned the murder as \\"alarming evidence\\" of the high rates of homophobia in Jamaican society. On 25 July, the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals & Gays (J-FLAG), an LGBT rights organisation, issued a public statement expressing their \\"deep concern\\" regarding the case, and offering their condolences to Jones' friends and family. They encouraged local people to aid the police in locating the perpetrators of the attack, which they asserted was an affront to Jamaica's democracy. J-FLAG's director Dane Lewis later commented that despite an increase in homophobic violence, Jamaican society was becoming more tolerant toward LGBT people; he attributed this to the actions of individuals like Jones, who have helped improve the public visibility of LGBT people in Jamaican society. Another LGBT rights organisation, Quality of Citizenship Jamaica, issued a press release calling for the government and churches to engage with LGBT organisations to establish common ground which could be undergirded by the principle of \\"true respect for all,\\" found in the nation's National Anthem. Human rights organisation Jamaicans for Justice called on Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller and religious leaders to condemn the murder, also commenting on what they saw as a lack of media coverage and public outrage about the incident, adding that \\"we must ask ourselves what this says about us as a people.\\" =Internationally= News of Jones' murder attracted international media attention, resulting in condemnation of the killing by human rights groups. Graeme Reid, the LGBT Rights Program director at Human Rights Watch in New York, issued a statement that the Jamaican government should send an \\"unequivocal message\\" that there would be \\"zero tolerance\\" of anti-LGBT violence. Reid noted that Jamaica's Prime Minister had vowed to decriminalise same-sex sexual activity in her 2011 election campaign but had yet to implement that promise. He encouraged the Jamaican authorities to take action to investigate Jones' murder and to promote respect for the country's LGBT citizens. In a February 2014 briefing, the U.S. Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, Uzra Zeya, cited Jones' case as well as the torture and murder of Cameroonian HIV/AIDS activist Eric Ohena Lembembe as examples of the \\"troubling acts of violence\\" against LGBT individuals that had happened across the globe in the previous year. In the United Kingdom, a black LGBT organisation, the Out and Proud Diamond Group (OPDG), in association with the Peter Tatchell Foundation, organised a protest outside Jamaica's London embassy on 28 August. Talking to press, the OPDG's Marvin Kibuuka condemned Jones' murder and called for supporters to actively oppose the persecution of LGBT people in both Jamaica and elsewhere. Peter Tatchell later asserted that the lack of action by Simpson-Miller and the police was tantamount to colluding with those guilty of an anti-LGBT hate crime. In her introduction to an academic study of \\"queerness and children's literature\\", Laura Robinson, an Associate Professor of English at the Royal Military College of Canada, cited Jones' murder alongside the 2013 Russian LGBT propaganda law as an example in which youth issues intersected with LGBT issues. She added that Jones was a \\"child who did not end up having what Judith Butler calls a 'livable life'.\\" See also *List of unsolved murders Notes References External links *GLBTQ Report on Jones, including footage of his dancing *Official website of the Dwayne's House charity Category:2013 crimes in Jamaica Category:2013 in LGBT history Category:Hate crimes Category:Incidents of violence against boys Category:July 2013 events in North America Category:Male murder victims Category:Murder in 2013 Category:People murdered in Jamaica Category:Unsolved murders Category:Violence against children Category:Violence against LGBT people Category:Violence against men in North America ","title":"Murder of Dwayne Jones"},{"id":"40239799","text":"NBBL may refer to: *National Bank of Belize *Nepal Bangladesh Bank ","title":"NBBL"},{"id":"40239810","text":"√âdouard Filhol Jean Pierre Bernard √âdouard Filhol (7 October 1814 ‚Äì 25 June 1883) was a French scientist.

It is part of the Pan-European corridor V branch B, which runs from Rijeka to Budapest. It is electrified and single-tracked.2014 H≈Ω network statement There are several short branch lines connected to the M202 railway, including the M602 railway ≈†krljevo‚ÄìBakar, M603 railway Su≈°ak-Peƒáine‚ÄìBrajdica area of the Port of Rijeka, and the L214 railway between Rijeka and Brajdica ‚Äî all in the area of the city of Rijeka or its immediate surroundings. History The line was first opened in 1865 between Zagreb and Karlovac, a branch of the Zidani most to Sisak line. The section to Rijeka was opened on 6 September 1873, and is notable for its steep descent towards the port city. Subsequently, in 1880, the line went from ownership of the Austrian Southern Railway Company to the Hungarian Government. After the First World War, the line entered ownership of the railways of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (from 1929, known as Yugoslavia). Rijeka stayed as a border station with the Ferrovie delle Stato up to 1945, when the whole line became part of the Yugoslav Railways. Since 1991, it is owned by the Croatian Railways. =Electrification= As early as 1936, the Italians electrified the Pivka-Rijeka line (not part of the current M202 railway) at the standard 3 kV DC voltage. After World War Two, the Yugoslav Railways considered the 3 kV DC electrification system to become the standard electrification system of the Yugoslav Railways, as it was already present in some parts of Croatia and Slovenia. As such, it became favoured in the 1950s and early 1960s, and electrification of the Zagreb-Rijeka line began: *1953: Rijeka-Fu≈æine *1960: Fu≈æine-Moravice *1963: Moravice-Karlovac *1970: Karlovac-Zagreb GK However, in the later half of the 1960s, the Yugoslav Railways considered the 25 kV AC at 50 Hz system instead, which later became the national standard (the project was initially experimented in Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1967 and 1969). At the same time when the electrification of the Zagreb-Rijeka line was completed, the Zagreb to Belgrade line was electrified too, at 25 kV AC. Thus, Zagreb became a multisystem station, for trains heading towards Rijeka and Ljubljana. In the first half of the 1980s, the Yugoslav Railways considered the full conversion of the remaining 3 kV DC network (by then present in all of Slovenia and parts of West Croatia) into the national standard. Work began in 1984 and the following segments were converted: *1985: Zagreb GK-Hrvatski Leskovac (alongside with line towards Dobova, Slovenia) *1987: Hrvatski Leskovac- Moravice *2012: Moravice-Rijeka But by 1991, the Yugoslav Railways had ran out of funds, and later on, with the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the line entered ownership of the newly-created Croatian Railways. For a long while, Moravice was a multisystem station, where former J≈Ω Class 362 locomotives would take over trains towards Rijeka, after being pulled by former J≈Ω Class 441 locomotives. Along the years, various proposals for the conversion of the network were done, including conversion of the Class 1061 locomotives to Class 1161 locomotives (these were 1061s with 25 kV AC systems, rebuilt at T≈ΩV Janko Gredelj) but eventually, the plans didnt really materialize, as Slovenia insisted on keeping the 3 kV DC electrification, and lack of funds in early 1990s Yugoslavia and Croatia led to the 1161 project to be abandoned. Finally, in December 2012, the rest of the line, from Moravice to Rijeka (and further onwards to the border with Slovenia) was fully converted to 25 kV AC. Now all electrified lines in Croatia use 25 kV AC electrification, although in some stations the Italian-style catenary is still visible. The last Class 1061 locomotives, along with Class 315 EMUs (a variant similar to the PKP EN57 multiple units) were withdrawn.

This phenomenon is particularly strong in people who do not use such words on a regular basis.Stephens, Richard, and Claudia Umland. \\"Swearing as a response to pain ‚Äì Effect of daily swearing frequency.\\" The Journal of Pain. Bish 12.12 (2011): 1274‚Äì1281. Effect The effect has been described as being a form of stress- induced analgesia, with swearing due to a painful stimulus being a form of emotional response. However, it is as yet unclear how swearing achieves the physical effects that have been described in the research. Swearing in response to pain may activate the amygdala which in turn triggers a fight-or- flight response. This then leads to a surge in adrenaline, a natural form of pain relief. Research Researchers from Keele University conducted a number of initial experiments in 2009 to examine the analgesic properties of swearing. Richard Stephens, John Atkins, and Andrew Kingston published \\"Swearing as a Response to Pain\\" in NeuroReport, finding that some people could hold their hands in ice water for twice as long as usual if they swore compared to if they used neutral words. They also reported feeling less pain. Stephens therefore says \\"I would advise people, if they hurt themselves, to swear\\". Further research by Stephens and colleague Claudia Umland was published under the title \\"Swearing as a Response to Pain ‚Äì Effect of Daily Swearing Frequency\\" in The Journal of Pain on 1 December 2011. They showed that subjects who indicated that they swore regularly each day did not demonstrate any or as much improvement in tolerance. Stephens theorises that the emotional attachment that a person has to a swearword affects the results. People who rarely use such words place a higher emotional value on them. In addition to their research Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker wrote in The Stuff of Thought that \\"humans are hardwired to swear cathartically... Swearing probably comes from a very primitive reflex that evolved in animals.\\" The experiments were repeated on television in episodes of MythBusters and Fry's Planet Word, both seeming to confirm the findings. The original research team of Stephens, Atkins, and Kingston were awarded the Ig Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 for their study. In 2017 researchers from Massey University examined whether verbal swearing would similarly reduce psychological pain. Using a similar method as Stephens and colleagues, Philipp and Lombardo found that people reported an emotionally distressing memory as less painful after swearing.

He tries to get together with Sara again but it doesn't work. He turns his focus back to his writing, gaining success while still troubled by the effect of the tragedy on his life. He maintains fleeting contact with Kate, mother of Nicholas and Christopher, who struggles with her own guilt and loss. Tomas later marries Ann, an employee of his publishing house, adopting her daughter Mina. Eleven years after the accident, a winner of the Giller Prize for his latest novel, Tomas receives a letter from now 16-year-old Christopher. Christopher is a self-proclaimed \\"problem child\\", whose school psychologist has suggested reaching out to Tomas. Their contacts are troubling, but end with Tomas and Christopher eventually helping each other get a calmer handle on their lives.

His attempt to seize the throne of Kakheti after Levan's death in 1574 was defeated by his half-brother, Alexander II. El-Mirza appears to have died during this fighting.  Biography  El-Mirza was born of Levan of Kakheti's second marriage to a daughter of Kamal Kara-Musel, the shamkhal of Tarki in Dagestan. After the death of Levan in 1574, El-Mirza put forward claims to the throne of Kakheti. His eldest brother and Levan's heir apparent, Prince Giorgi, had been killed in 1561 and his older half-brother, Alexander, had been disowned by Levan. On his father's death, El-Mirza and his brothers, Khosro and Vakhtang, seized control of Kakheti. Alexander quickly countermoved by having himself crowned as king at Bodbe with the help of the Upper Kakhetians. He further enlisted support of his in-laws from the neighboring kingdom of Kartli, whose ruler, Daud-Khan, sent in an army under the command of Prince Bardzim Amilakhori, Alexander's father-in-law, and Elizbar, Duke of Ksani. Facing the intervention, El-Mirza and his brothers saw their troops defecting to Alexander and had to rely on the support of the shamkhal and the Lesgians, but were beaten at the battle of Torga. According to the 18th- century Georgian historian, Prince Vakhushti, the three brothers were killed in this confrontation, but El-Mirza appears to have died in 1580. El-Mirza was married to the certain Ketevan, by whom he had a son, Iovel ( 1580).

She is married to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and has been described as de Blasio's \\"closest advisor.\\" She chairs the Mayor's Fund to Advance New York City and leads ThriveNYC. She has also published poetry and worked in politics as a speechwriter. Early life and education McCray was born in Springfield, Massachusetts and spent her early years there. Her mother, Katharine Clarissa Eileen (n√©e Edwards), was an assembly worker at an electronics factory, and her father, Robert Hooper McCray, was an inventory clerk at a military base. She is of Barbadian and St. Lucian descent, but traces her grandmother's last name (Quashie) to Ghana. When she was ten years old, her family moved to Longmeadow, Massachusetts, becoming only the second black family in the area. Other families in the neighborhood circulated petitions demanding they leave. During a portion of her high school years, McCray was the only black student in her school. McCray cites her early experience with racism and bullying as part of the reason she began to write, using her poetry as an outlet for her anger. She wrote a column for her school newspaper in which she denounced classmates for their racism. McCray enrolled at Wellesley College in 1972. While studying there, she became a member of a black feminist organization known as the Combahee River Collective. Career After graduating from college, McCray moved to New York City to work for Redbook. She published an essay in Essence in 1979 entitled \\"I Am a Lesbian\\". Essence later described the essay as \\"groundbreaking\\", asserting that it was \\"perhaps the first time a Black gay woman had spoken so openly and honestly about her sexuality in a Black magazine\\". The purpose of the essay was to \\"dispel the myth that there are no gay black people\\". Some of her poetry is included in Home Girls: A Black Feminist Anthology. In 1991, McCray entered politics. She worked as a speechwriter for New York City Mayor David Dinkins. During the Clinton administration, she worked for the New York Foreign Press Center as a public affairs specialist. She also worked as a speechwriter for the New York State Comptroller Carl McCall and for New York City Comptroller Bill Thompson. McCray with spouse, Bill de Blasio, and their two children. In 2004, McCray left Thompson's office to work in the private sector. She worked for five years at Maimonides Medical Center. She also worked for Citigroup in its public relations department for six months before deciding it was \\"not a good fit\\". During her husband's campaign for mayor of New York City in the 2013 election, she edited his speeches and helped interview candidates for staff positions. = Involvement in de Blasio administration = When de Blasio became mayor, he hired publicist Rachel Noerdlinger to be McCray's chief of staff. Noerdlinger later resigned her post following a series of controversies surrounding her behavior and the behavior of persons close to her. In his second month in office, de Blasio named McCray chair of the Mayor‚Äôs Fund to Advance New York City. Since then, the Fund has focused on mental health, immigration, and youth workforce projects. In May 2018, The New York Times reported that McCray had last visited the offices of the Mayor's Fund in May 2017. The Times further reported that according to McCray's public schedule, she had spent 19.5 hours in 2017 on work for the Mayor's Fund; however, her spokeswoman estimated that McCray spent 10% of her work schedule on Mayor's Fund business.  ThriveNYC  In November 2015, McCray led the launch of ThriveNYC, a plan to overhaul the city's mental health and substance abuse services. ThriveNYC promotes a shift from a traditionally more reactive model, which can strain police, prisons, hospitals, and schools, to an integrated public health approach focusing on awareness and early identification. In February 2019, Politico criticized ThriveNYC for having an \\"opaque budget\\" and \\"elusive metrics\\". In a March 2019 article on ThriveNYC, The New York Times reported: \\"Public health officials credit the plan for drawing attention to mental health‚Ä¶ At the same time, some initiatives failed to get started, while others placed unrealistic demands on already strained mental health services\\". The Times added: \\"A spreadsheet of nearly 500 data points tracked by City Hall included almost none related to patient outcomes\\". ThriveNYC drew harsh criticism over allegations of mismanagement and accusations that it had failed to produce records of tangible results. As of March 2019, nearly $850 million in funding for McCray‚Äôs mental health program was unaccounted for; furthermore, the program was on track to spend $1 billion over five years. Bronx Councilman Ritchie Torres criticized ThriveNYC, stating that there was \\"no evidence it‚Äôs working\\". = Political ambitions = In March 2018, McCray stated that she was \\"seriously considering\\" running for office in 2021 (the year that de Blasio's second and final term as New York City mayor is scheduled to end). McCray added that she would not run for mayor of New York City. Personal life McCray published an essay in Essence in 1979 entitled \\"I Am a Lesbian\\". In that essay, McCray \\"frankly discussed her sexuality and expressed gratitude that she came to terms with her preference for women before marrying a man\\". McCray met Bill de Blasio in 1991, when they both worked at New York City Hall for then Mayor David Dinkins. At the time, de Blasio was an aide to a deputy mayor and McCray was a speechwriter. McCray and de Blasio were married in 1994 in Prospect Park, Brooklyn. Asked about her sexuality, McCray has stated that she hates \\"labels\\". In 2012, when asked about her 1979 essay, she commented: \\"In the 1970s, I identified as a lesbian and wrote about it. In 1991, I met the love of my life, married him.\\" McCray and de Blasio have a daughter, Chiara, and a son, Dante. The family lived in Park Slope, Brooklyn until their 2014 move into Gracie Mansion.

It won the David Silver Award at the 2011 Jewish Film Festival in Warsaw, and was also nominated for Best Documentary at the Jerusalem Film Festival and at the Cinema South Festival in Israel. 5 Broken Cameras At the end of 2011, Davidi released his second feature-length film, 5 Broken Cameras, a joint Israeli-Palestinian-French production in cooperation with Israel's Channel 8 as well as TV channels in France and the Netherlands. The film is based on six years of video footage taken by photographer Emad Burnat, a resident of Bil'in. The film chronicles the village‚Äôs struggle against the construction of the separation barrier as seen through the eyes of Burnat, as well as the effects of the village‚Äôs struggle on Burnat's family and personal life. The film was met with international acclaim, winning the World Cinema Directing Award at the Sundance Film Festival in 2012, the Special Broadcaster IDFA Audience Award and the Special Jury Award at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam in 2011, the 2012 Audience Award at the Sheffield Doc/Fest, the 2013 international Emmy Award as well as more than ten other awards from around the world. The film was also sold to dozens of TV stations and was released in movie theaters across the world including the United States, Canada, England, France, and Japan. The film was screened at the 2012 Jerusalem Film Festival and the 2012 Israeli Cinema South Festival, where it won the Juliano Mer Prize. The film was nominated in the category of Best Documentary at the Academy Awards, where it ran against another Israeli production, The Gatekeepers. Davidi sparked controversy when he stated in an interview with Israeli TV that \\"he does not represent Israel, only himself\\" at the Oscars. Current projects In addition to his work as a filmmaker, Davidi also teaches cinema and video skills for the project, Video Act. The project works with artists to help them independently produce films that promote critical thinking and social change.

It was also referred to as the \\"Independent IGY (International Geophysical Year) Tracking Coordination Program\\". Use of volunteers Supported by the Society of Photographic Scientists and Engineers (later the Society for Imaging Science and Technology), Phototrack enlisted volunteers who had wide-angle optical instruments with film-recording capability. Volunteers were recruited with announcements in various magazines and newspapers.\\"Sky and Telescope\\", Vol. XVII, No. 8, June 1958, in sidebar titled \\"Operation Phototrack\\" on p. 387 (Table of Contents page)\\"The Rotarian\\", Aug 1958, p. 34 Like its contemporary volunteer visual-tracking program called Moonwatch, it continued for some years as a supplement to the Baker-Nunn operation, since its results could fill in for the main system's losses due to, for example, weather problems. Also like Moonwatch, some of its volunteers were located in countries outside the U. S,\\"List of Coordinates of Stations Engaged in the Observation of Artificial Earth Satellites\\", D.V. Mechau, Smithsonian Astrophysical Society, 1960 such as Canada,\\"Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada\\", 1961, p 236 Australia and Japan. Time exposure photographs The photographs produced were time exposures in which a satellite's track appeared as a long, usually slightly curved, line seen against a background of stars. If the camera were stationary, the tracks of the much more slowly moving stars appeared as much shorter lines, which were portions of arcs about the pole. If the volunteer had a motor-driven polar- axis camera mount that countered the earth's rotation, the stars were represented by dots whose sizes depended on the resolution of the camera lens and the magnitude of the star. Example of some typical contents of images submitted to Operation Phototrack by participating volunteers. With knowledge of the camera's latitude/longitude position and its elevation above sea level, both obtainable from USGS (U. S. Geological Survey) 7¬Ω-minute quadrangle maps (before the days of Global Positioning System devices), comparison of the track with the star background could define the satellite's successive positions. To correlate those positions with times, breaks in the lines were created by interrupting the exposures at times known by their relationship with radio time signals broadcast by the U. S. National Bureau of Standards. Suitable times for making photos were when the observer's sky was dark enough to show stars but the very high altitude satellite was directly illuminated by the sun. Most such times were during the two hours before dawn or after sunset at the observer's location, but vehicles reaching sufficiently southerly or northerly latitudes were sometimes illuminated by sunlight coming over the polar regions. Film requirements The program required negatives submitted for measurement to be at least 4 by 5 inches (over 100 by 125 mm) in size and the lens to have a focal length of at least 5 inches. The film was to be as light-sensitive a type as could be obtained on the non-professional market and strongly developed to further increase that sensitivity. Measurement of such negatives could determine the locations of multiple points along the satellite's path within 150 feet, or about 50 meters Project management Phototrack was directed by Norton Goodwin, who was also an author, along with L. N. Cormier and R. K. Squires, of a manual\\"Simplified Satellite Prediction from modified orbital elements\\", Leonard N. Cormier, Norton Goodwin, and Reginald K. Squires, National Academy of Sciences - National Research Council, Washington 25, D.C. Limited Draft Edition, 29 August 1958. Reprinted 1 January 1959 as \\"IGY Satellite Report Series, Number 7 for prediction of satellite observing times from modified orbital elements, in which \\"modified\\" meant earth-centered orbital elements using longitude and latitude as coordinates rather than astronomers‚Äô declination and right ascension. Procedures described in that document were to be used by program participants for making calculations to determine times and aiming directions for using their instruments. =Computation handbook= Goodwin was also the listed author of another program booklet containing tables of trigonometric functions.\\"Seven Place Cosines, Sines, and Tangents For Every Tenth Microturn\\", Norton Goodwin, Director, Independent Tracking Coordination Program. Reprinted 1964 for the Society of Photographic Scientists and Engineers by H. B. Roebuck and Son, Inc., Baltimore, MD An unusual feature of these tables was the specification of angles in \\"turns\\", one turn being 360 degrees, or 2pi radians. They were calculated for \\"every tenth microturn\\", which referred to the ordinal tenths, not the fractional tenths. Those values, calculated on early digital computers, were made available to be used by Phototrack participants for making decimal calculations. Besides a \\"limited draft edition\\" of the computation handbook, published in August 1958, a later version was published by the National Academy of Sciences ‚Äì National Research Council in January 1959 as Number 7 in its \\"IGY Satellite Report Series\\". The book of tables was also re-published by the Society of Photographic Scientists and Engineers in 1964. =Observer updates= Observers were provided with sufficiently frequent updates of the orbital parameters of known objects, based on past observations, to permit each to work out his own predictions of suitable looking times and directions for his own location. Updates were sent primarily by postal mail in the form of about weekly postcards, but some information was available by radio.\\"Annual Report of the Civil Air Patrol -- Looking Spaceward\\", 1958 The data provided on the cards were the modified orbital elements used in the handbook calculations. That being before either home computers or even electronic calculators existed, most program participants had to do their calculations, including long divisions, either manually or with mechanical calculating devices. =Final analysis= Exposed negatives containing good tracks and star backgrounds and clear time markers were sent to the program, which forwarded them to trained analysts for measurement. Although little evidence of a satellite's distance from the observing station was available from any single negative, and exposures at different stations did not occur simultaneously, combining of the results from several stations, plus accurately measurable items such as the orbital period, allowed parameters of credible smooth orbital paths to be derived.

Discrete time Discrete sampled signal Discrete time views values of variables as occurring at distinct, separate \\"points in time\\", or equivalently as being unchanged throughout each non-zero region of time (\\"time period\\")--that is, time is viewed as a discrete variable. Thus a non-time variable jumps from one value to another as time moves from one time period to the next. This view of time corresponds to a digital clock that gives a fixed reading of 10:37 for a while, and then jumps to a new fixed reading of 10:38, etc. In this framework, each variable of interest is measured once at each time period. The number of measurements between any two time periods is finite. Measurements are typically made at sequential integer values of the variable \\"time\\". A discrete signal or discrete-time signal is a time series consisting of a sequence of quantities. Unlike a continuous-time signal, a discrete-time signal is not a function of a continuous argument; however, it may have been obtained by sampling from a continuous-time signal. When a discrete-time signal is obtained by sampling a sequence at uniformly spaced times, it has an associated sampling rate. Discrete-time signals may have several origins, but can usually be classified into one of two groups:\\"Digital Signal Processing\\" Prentice Hall - Pages 11-12 * By acquiring values of an analog signal at constant or variable rate. This process is called sampling.\\"Digital Signal Processing: Instant access.\\" Butterworth-Heinemann - Page 8 * By observing an inherently discrete-time process, such as the weekly peak value of a particular economic indicator. Continuous time In contrast, continuous time views variables as having a particular value for potentially only an infinitesimally short amount of time. Between any two points in time there are an infinite number of other points in time. The variable \\"time\\" ranges over the entire real number line, or depending on the context, over some subset of it such as the non-negative reals. Thus time is viewed as a continuous variable. A continuous signal or a continuous-time signal is a varying quantity (a signal) whose domain, which is often time, is a continuum (e.g., a connected interval of the reals). That is, the function's domain is an uncountable set. The function itself need not be continuous. To contrast, a discrete time signal has a countable domain, like the natural numbers. A signal of continuous amplitude and time is known as a continuous- time signal or an analog signal. This (a signal) will have some value at every instant of time. The electrical signals derived in proportion with the physical quantities such as temperature, pressure, sound etc. are generally continuous signals. Other examples of continuous signals are sine wave, cosine wave, triangular wave etc. The signal is defined over a domain, which may or may not be finite, and there is a functional mapping from the domain to the value of the signal. The continuity of the time variable, in connection with the law of density of real numbers, means that the signal value can be found at any arbitrary point in time. A typical example of an infinite duration signal is: f(t) = \\\\sin(t), \\\\quad t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} A finite duration counterpart of the above signal could be: f(t) = \\\\sin(t), \\\\quad t \\\\in [-\\\\pi,\\\\pi] and f(t) = 0 otherwise. The value of a finite (or infinite) duration signal may or may not be finite. For example, f(t) = \\\\frac{1}{t}, \\\\quad t \\\\in [0,1] and f(t) = 0 otherwise, is a finite duration signal but it takes an infinite value for t = 0\\\\,. In many disciplines, the convention is that a continuous signal must always have a finite value, which makes more sense in the case of physical signals. For some purposes, infinite singularities are acceptable as long as the signal is integrable over any finite interval (for example, the t^{-1} signal is not integrable at infinity, but t^{-2} is). Any analog signal is continuous by nature. Discrete-time signals, used in digital signal processing, can be obtained by sampling and quantization of continuous signals. Continuous signal may also be defined over an independent variable other than time. Another very common independent variable is space and is particularly useful in image processing, where two space dimensions are used. Relevant contexts Discrete time is often employed when empirical measurements are involved, because normally it is only possible to measure variables sequentially. For example, while economic activity actually occurs continuously, there being no moment when the economy is totally in a pause, it is only possible to measure economic activity discretely. For this reason, published data on, for example, gross domestic product will show a sequence of quarterly values. When one attempts to empirically explain such variables in terms of other variables and/or their own prior values, one uses time series or regression methods in which variables are indexed with a subscript indicating the time period in which the observation occurred. For example, yt might refer to the value of income observed in unspecified time period t, y3 to the value of income observed in the third time period, etc. Moreover, when a researcher attempts to develop a theory to explain what is observed in discrete time, often the theory itself is expressed in discrete time in order to facilitate the development of a time series or regression model. On the other hand, it is often more mathematically tractable to construct theoretical models in continuous time, and often in areas such as physics an exact description requires the use of continuous time. In a continuous time context, the value of a variable y at an unspecified point in time is denoted as y(t) or, when the meaning is clear, simply as y. Types of equations =Discrete time= Discrete time makes use of difference equations, also known as recurrence relations. An example, known as the logistic map or logistic equation, is : x_{t+1} = rx_t(1-x_t), in which r is a parameter in the range from 2 to 4 inclusive, and x is a variable in the range from 0 to 1 inclusive whose value in period t nonlinearly affects its value in the next period, t+1. For example, if r=4 and x_1 = 1/3, then for t=1 we have x_2=4(1/3)(2/3)=8/9, and for t=2 we have x_3=4(8/9)(1/9)=32/81. Another example models the adjustment of a price P in response to non-zero excess demand for a product as :P_{t+1} = P_t + \\\\delta \\\\cdot f(P_t,...) where \\\\delta is the positive speed-of-adjustment parameter which is less than or equal to 1, and where f is the excess demand function. =Continuous time= Continuous time makes use of differential equations. For example, the adjustment of a price P in response to non-zero excess demand for a product can be modeled in continuous time as :\\\\frac{dP}{dt}=\\\\lambda \\\\cdot f(P,...) where the left side is the first derivative of the price with respect to time (that is, the rate of change of the price), \\\\lambda is the speed-of-adjustment parameter which can be any positive finite number, and f is again the excess demand function. Graphical depiction A variable measured in discrete time can be plotted as a step function, in which each time period is given a region on the horizontal axis of the same length as every other time period, and the measured variable is plotted as a height that stays constant throughout the region of the time period. In this graphical technique, the graph appears as a sequence of horizontal steps. Alternatively, each time period can be viewed as a detached point in time, usually at an integer value on the horizontal axis, and the measured variable is plotted as a height above that time-axis point. In this technique, the graph appears as a set of dots. The values of a variable measured in continuous time are plotted as a continuous function, since the domain of time is considered to be the entire real axis or at least some connected portion of it.

It is a sequel of the Tamil film Jai Hind. and was simultaneously made in Kannada, Tamil, and Telugu, with the former version titled as Abhimanyu. The film focuses on India becoming a superpower, as it appeared in A. P. J. Abdul Kalam's dreams, and tries to tackle the issues in the education system. The film released on 7 November 2014. This film won the Karnataka State Film Award for Second Best Film. This film was a blockbuster at the Sandalwood box office, but did not perform well in Tamil and Telugu. Plot Jaihind tells the story of the journey of five people, linked by one man, who fights for children's rights to education. Parvathi (Yuvina Parthavi), from a very poor family background, gets an admission into one of the most affluent schools in the city. However, the man of the house is forced to sell one of his kidneys in order to pay the exorbitant school fees. They still are unable to raise nearly enough money for the school, and they finally give up and commit suicide. This disturbs Abhimanyu (Arjun Sarja) deeply, and the computer service engineer becomes a hero overnight, by propagandizing a solution for education costing so much. Abhimanyu suggests that all private schools be nationalised, which will compel them to offer services at very little fees compared to that being collected now, while still ensuring that the quality of education is not compromised. This is bad news for the private school owners, who make a business out of educating children. Abhimanyu is targeted and pushed to extremes for his ideas. He is put behind bars and has people conspiring to murder him. How he succeeds in his mission, despite all this, forms the crux of the movie.

Soundtrack Release The satellite rights of the film's Tamil version were sold to Zee Thamizh and Kannada version were sold to Colors Kannada. =Tax Exemption Issue= The Tamil version did not get tax exemption, due to the claim that \\"Jai Hind\\" is not a Tamil word. Actor Arjun argued to the committee members but was unsuccessful in the attempt. Critical reception The movie opened with moderate to mixed reviews from critics. The Hindu stated \\"Arjunin Jai Hind 2 is the kind of film about which you shrug and say, ‚ÄúWell, if you liked Jai Hind‚Ä¶‚Äù. If you have to watch a film about a one-man army, you could do worse than watch one with Arjun in it. He totally pulls it off\\". The Times of India gave 3 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"For most parts, Arjunin Jai Hind 2 plays like a collage of various Arjun films...What's interesting, however, is that instead of telling his story as a straightforward narrative, Arjun presents it as events from the lives of different individuals who come into Abhimanyu's life...The problem with the film is that it tells a predictable story and in a rather longwinded manner\\". The New Indian Express wrote, \\"The film conveys a relevant message, but one that could have been better executed. The saving grace is Arjun who has penned the plot and screenplay, directed and produced the film. The actor tackles his role with cool intensity. His physique well toned, the action king is a delight to watch in the fights-stunt scenes as he packs a powerful punch at his tormentors. If only his screenplay had matched the lofty message\\". Rediff gave 2 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"Unfortunately, Arjun fails as a director. Despite the good storyline, he struggles to keep the audience involved. The real issue seems lost in all the unnecessary twists and drama surrounding the characters. Patriotic action dramas have been his forte, but Jai Hind 2 neither creates empathy for the characters and their situation, nor has entertainment value\\". Behindwoods.com gave 1.75 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"Jai Hind 2 travels on a very predictable path and the writing is quite disjointed. There is plenty of melodrama which gives the film a tonality of 80s...The theme of education for all is quite relevant at the time of ‚ÄòRight to Education', but had it been executed well, Jai Hind 2 would have worked well\\". Indiaglitz.com gave 2 out of 5 and wrote, \\"Keeping himself up with the pace, Arjun has delivered movies of social concern and importance, from time to time.

Indiaglitz.com gave 8 out of 10 and wrote, \\"Terrific action, tolerable narration, appealing in contents ‚Äì Arjun Sarja in his first direction in Kannada has given a ‚ÄòPaisa Vasool‚Äô cinema Abhimanyu\\". The New Indian Express wrote, \\"Abhimanyu is a taut action film with a strong social message. The subject would not have lost its grip if he was a little focussed on what exactly he wanted to say.

The bridge, at , is the longest covered bridge in Virginia and one of the last that supports regular traffic. Near the town of Mount Jackson, the Meems Bottom Covered Bridge features a 200-foot single-span wooden Burr arch structure. Built in 1892 by Franklin Hiser Wissler, the wooden bridge over the North Fork of the Shenandoah River provided access to his apple orchards at Strathmore Farms. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 10, 1975. History It's believed that there were at least two prior bridges near Meem's Bottom that were lost by flood and fire. The first bridge was likely burned in 1862 by Stonewall Jackson's Rebels, and the second, washed away by floodwaters in 1870. There were likely also other bridges called Meems Bottom Bridge from Meem's bottomland, an alluvial plain formed by the North Fork of the Shenandoah, across the river to Mt. Jackson. In a predawn raid on 3 October 1864, Confederate Captain John McNeill led anwywhere from 30 to 60 Confederate rangers (sources vary as to the number) against roughly 100 Union troopers of the 8th Ohio Cavalry Regiment guarding Meems Bottom, the bridge to Mt. Jackson, a strategic crossing on the Valley Turnpike. The attack lasted just fifteen minutes with most of the Union cavalry captured but McNeill, one the best-known Confederate partisan raiders, was mortally wounded. He was taken to the house on Rude's Hill, where his identity was discovered by Union General Sheridan. He was then moved to Harrisonburg where he died. The current Meems Bottom Covered Bridge is the fourth formally recorded bridge across the North Fork of the Shenandoah River at the location.Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission Staff 1975, 2008, p. 3.Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission Staff 1975, 2008, p. 5. The first bridge was constructed between 1867 and 1868, and was subsequently destroyed by a flood in March 1870. The bridge was replaced by 1871; however, this bridge was destroyed by floodwaters in November 1877. The third bridge was constructed in 1878 and was replaced by the current structure in 1894. Another, earlier bridge at a nearby location was destroyed by General Stonewall Jackson's troops in 1862 during the American Civil War. The name of the bridge derives from the locally prominent Meem family, which held large tracts of land in the area.Virginia Department of Transportation 2012 The timbers that were used to build the bridge of 1894 were cut from Confederate General Gilbert S. Meem's former farm, Strathmoor, located nearby. The farm was bought by F. H. Whisler in 1891; he contracted John Woods to construct the 1894 bridge. Some of timber were cut locally by J. L. Olinger.Miller 1975-1982, p. 124. The current bridge is of the Burr Truss design, which was patented by Theodore Burr, brother of U.S. Vice President Aaron Burr, in 1817.Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission Staff 1975, 2008, p. 4. The bridge spans a length of across the river, making the bridge the longest still-standing covered bridge in Virginia. Two stone abutments, which extend ten feet below the riverbed, support the bridge on the sides of the river. The rock used in the abutments was gathered from local quarries. The bridge consists of two arches on each side spanning the length of the bridge and joining the abutments below the top of the abutments' stone construction. The arches are constructed of three sections each of by timbers bolted together. The vertical truss supports and horizontal roof supports are composed of by lumber. The diagonal truss supports are by timbers. Originally, the floor supports consisted of two by beams along the length of the bridge and by beams supporting the roadway running from side to side. The bridge was strengthened in 1937 with the addition of steel I-beams running along the length of the bridge and parallel to the roadway supports. A new road surface was also added at this time. The bridge continued to serve traffic until it was destroyed by fire when vandals burned the bridge on October 31, 1976. The original timbers of the bridge were salvaged, however, and the bridge was reconstructed and put back into service by September 1979. The restoration included new concrete piers and steel beams. Meems Bottom Covered Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 10, 1975. An updated listing was added on April 23, 2008. The bridge is also on the Virginia Landmarks Register and was listed on April 15, 1975. The updated listing was added March 10, 2008.

The magazine ran from May 1900 to November 1909. It was initially published out of Boston by the Colored Co-Operative Publishing Company, and from 1904, forward, by Moore Publishing and Printing Company of New York. Pauline Hopkins, its most prolific writer from the beginning, sat on the board as a shareholder, was editor from 1902 to 1904, though her name was not on the masthead until 1903. Hopkins was a journalist, playwright, historian, and literary. In 1904, Booker T. Washington, in a hostile takeover, purchased the magazine and replaced Hopkins with Fred Randolph Moore (1857‚Äì1943) as editor.  History  The Colored American Magazine was founded by Walter Wallace, Jesse W. Watkins, Harper S. Fortune, and Walter Alexander Johnson. The holding company was named The Colored Co- Operative Publishing Company. On May 13, 1903, William H. Dupree (1839‚Äì1934), and Jesse W. Watkins purchased the magazine from the Colored Co-operative Publishing Company and renamed the holding company The Colored American Publishing Company. Their aim was to redeem the magazine, financially, and to secure its location in Boston with Hopkins as editor. = Post-1996 findings relating to Pauline Hopkins = John C. Freund (1848‚Äì1924), London-born and Oxford educated co-founder and influential editor of two New York magazines, The Music Trades and Musical America, became an outside investor in the magazine in 1903. Recently, beginning around 1996, after the rediscovery of 20 letters in the Pauline Hopkins Collection at the Fisk University Library, scholars show that Hopkins sensed that Freund had conspired with Booker T. Washington to replace her as editor ‚Äî to quell her outspokenness on racial matters, which in that era, was a prevailing taboo in the minds of many whites. Freund, a white man, and Washington, an African American man, prevailed against Hopkins, an African American woman. The letters reveal that Hopkins, a well-articulated and influential editor, was a victim of sexism and nuanced racism that was masked by the enlisted cooperation of Washington. Freund apparently believed, and perhaps Washington believed, that directness, about race issues, and racial activism by the magazine would do more harm than good ‚Äî it would generate greater racial discord in society, harm the economic viability of the magazine, drive away white readership, marginalize the potential for the magazine to win support of whites who otherwise harbored cynical views towards racial equality. Freund felt that the goal of the magazine was to \\"first‚Äîrecord the work the colored people are doing; second‚Äîto make the whites acquainted with it.\\" Freund opposed writers who felt that advancing bravely required historic retrospection. In other instances, Freund had rallied support towards helping African Americans succeed and he patronized those who had attained success, which included financial support and published critical acclaim for the People's Chorus, directed by Emma Azalia Hackley (1867‚Äì1922). The upshot was that Hopkins believed, as documented in her letters, that Freund's altruistic gestures towards helping her and the magazine were actually a ploy to oust her and take control of the magazine's political content. There are differing views on Freund and Washington's motives, and differing views on who led the charge, but there is little debate on how Hopkins perceived it..

It is located just off Amagerbrogade, next to Eberts Villaby. The church is closely affiliated with the nearby St. Ann's School. History The church traces its history back to 1897 when a house on Christian II's Vej in Eberts Villaby, which had recently been completed by a local developer, came into use as the first Catholic place of worship on Amager in modern times. Known as St. Anne's Chapel (Danish: Sankt Ann√¶ Kapel), it was used for church service on Sundays and as a Catholic school on weekdays. The chapel was in 1903 replaced by a proper church building, St. Anne's Church. It was built in connection with the Grey Nun's establishment of St. Elizabeth's Hospital which opened on the other side of the street two years later. The architect of the church was Emil J√∏rgensen who also designed the hospital and S√∏nderbro Pharmacy which opened next to hospital in 1904. When St. Anne's Church became too small for the growing population on Amager, it was decided to replace it with a larger one. The old building was demolished in 1935 and the foundation stone for its replacement, which was designed by Sven Risom, was set by Bishop Josef Brems on 19 November 1936. The church was consecrated on 26 March 1938. Architecture The church is built in red brick in a National Romantic style. It is 29 metres long ( 95 feet ) and 18 metres wide ( 59 feet ). Its twin towers stand at 24.5 metres ( 80 feet ). It seats 400. Interior and fittings The altarpiece consists of four paintings, depicting four key events in Jesus's life on earth: The Birth of Christ, the Last Supper, at the Foot of the Cross and Christ's Ascension. The paintings as well as the large crucifix were created by the artist Wilhelm Wils and installed in 1954. Dating from 1946, Our Lady of Perpetual Help's altar was created by the sculptor Axel Theilmann. The icon was created by Birgitte West as an exact copy of the original icon in Church of St. Alphonsus Liguori in Rome. The central image is surrounded by six reliefs representing the Annunciation, Jesus' birth, the Marriage at Cana, the Pieta and the Assumption. They are executed by the sculptor Wedel-Schmidt and were inaugurated on 1 May 1947. An inscription reads: \\"In 1944/45, as the war came closer to Denmark, leaving everybody frightened, St. Anne's congregation promised to raise this altar in honor of God and his holy Mother, the perpetual Help.\\" In connection with the 300-year commemoration of the scientist Nicolas Steno's birth in 1938, two silver candlesticks with the scientist's coat of arms were donated to the church. The font was originally installed in the first St. Anne's church in 1903. It is carved in Bremers sandstone to a design by the architect Emil Jorgensen. Service Services are held at different times of the day in Danish, English and Polish. St. Ann's School St. Ann's School is now located at Otto Ruds Vej 7. The bilingual school has about 500 students (Grade 0-10) and a staff of about 40 teachers. The school logo features a Viking ship carrying an image of the church on its sail.

Early life He was born in Griffithstown, Monmouthshire, Wales. He was educated at West Monmouth School in Pontypool and then attended Aberystwyth University College, University College London and then Trinity College, Cambridge. Career He became warden of Merthyr Settlement and then a tutor in Worcester for the University of Birmingham from 1934 to 1937. From 1937 to 1941 he was a lecturer in English at the University College, Cardiff. He was a temporary principal at the Board of Trade in 1941. From 1942 to 1952 he was Winterstoke Professor of English at the University of Bristol. In 1952 he was appointed Vice Chancellor of the University of Southampton. The university had been the Hartley University College awarding external degrees of the University of London. It had been founded 50 years earlier in 1902, and its origin was as the Hartley Institution formed in 1862. The university college had been granted full university status on 29 April 1952 when Queen Elizabeth II granted it a Royal Charter. Student numbers in 1952 were about 1,000 with a staff of around 100. By 1963 student numbers had grown to 2,094. During James' tenure, in 1963 the Nuffield Theatre was opened on the main Highfield campus for both visiting and university performers. Also in James' tenure, the Robbins Report was published in 1963. This proposed that the number of students at English universities should rise from 150,000 to 170,000. Southampton set about increasing its students to 4,000, not by 1980 as planned, but by 1967 and James‚Äô last two years as vice-chancellor set about reaching that target. After Southampton he was a visiting lecturer at several institutions including Yale University from 1965 to 1966.

Su√°rez often told him to lead off topics with the sentence: \\"No te comas la cabeza, hombre, que son cuatro d√≠as\\" (in English: Don't bother yourself, man, we live for four days). He wrote the songs \\"Historia triste\\" (Sad Story), \\"Cerebros Destruidos\\" (Destroyed Brains) and \\"M√°s all√° del cementerio\\" (Far Away from the Graveyard). Juanma was a sexually active person, but was negligent with his health, he smoked, drank alcohol and took amphetamines. As early as the 1980s was said to be \\"un kamikaze del pastilleo\\" (kamikaze of drugs). Suffered from a case of endocarditis that nearly killed him in 1985, when he chose to treat himself with analgesics instead of seeking the advice of a doctor. Another serious hospitalization was at the early 1985. In 1988 his addiction to drugs became more complicated. He was frequently spotted on his white mobylette, working temporally to get money for heroin. His relationship with Iosu broke down during that period, although among them were never held distances.  Death  On 9 October 1992, Juanma Su√°rez died in Santurce, of heart attack and resulting complications. He was 30. He was buried a short distance from his long-time friend Iosu Exp√≥sito.  Equipment  Juanma mainly played a Westone Thunder 1A Bass to the late 1980s, he occasionally used a Fender Jazz Bass to the early 1990s. His playing style utilises both pick and fingers, although he played mostly with picks.

A Library Park () is a term first used in Colombia for an urban complex formed by a combination of a library building with ample surrounding green space for public use.

According to the Mayor of Medell√≠n, \\"The library parks are cultural centers for social development that encourage citizen encounters, educational and recreational activities, building groups, the approach to the new challenges in digital culture.

It is part of the Market Drayton Churches Together group of churches and Market Drayton Food Bank. History Market Drayton's first Methodists held their meetings in private houses in 1799, in places then called Tinkers Lane and Ranters Gullet. A visiting Archdeacon of Salop at that time wrote \\"there are many church-going Methodists here, probably some hundreds\\". In 1807, a Wesleyan Methodist Chapel was built on land between Keelings Lane and Street Lane, now called Salisbury Road and Shrewsbury Road respectively. Ten years later it was enlarged and more seating was added in 1842 by building a gallery. The building had served many purposes during the 172 years, as a chapel, Sunday school, and Wesleyan day-school, continuing as Sunday school and ancillary to the new Chapel which was situated on the other side of the road from 1866. The 1866 Chapel was a more elaborate building and much more ornate than the first chapel. Memorial stones were laid on 25 August 1864, and the building was completed in 1866. It was set back in its own grounds, and a flourishing cedar-tree dominated the front area of lawn and shrubs. One main alteration was made in 1888 when a two-storey block replaced the original single-storey vestry. In 1974 this block was demolished to make way for the new building comprising entrance porch, foyer, classroom/minister‚Äôs vestry, kitchen, lounge and large hall. The Sunday School and Church were united on the one site in 1975 when a new annexe was opened. On Monday 25 November 1981 a violent wind caused irreparable damage to the church. The building was demolished in 1982. The current building opened on 28 September 1985. This also marked the amalgamation of the Primitive congregation and Wesleyan congregations into one group. This allowed the Primitive Methodist property on Frogmore Road, Market Drayton to be sold. The building today is of a modern design split over two levels inside.

He is most well known for his contributions to American Surrealism, but his work also encompassed styles such as Cubism, Social Realism, and Abstraction. Reclusive by nature, a character trait that became more exaggerated in the 1940s and later, Kelly's work reflects his determination not to be limited by the trends of his time. His large output of paintings is complemented by a prolific number of drawings that span his career of 50 years. Some of the collections where his work is represented are: The Metropolitan Museum in New York, The Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and Boston Public Library.  Biography  Kelly was born in 1901 at home at 1533 Newkirk Street, Philadelphia, PA. He was the only child of Elizabeth (n√©e Stevenson) and Pantaleon L. Kelly. The family resided in Philadelphia where Pantaleon and two of his cousins owned Kelly Brothers, a successful tailoring business. The prosperity of the firm enabled his father to purchase a 144-acre farm in Bucks County PA in 1902, which he named \\"Rural Retreat\\"Muller, Norman. \\"Leon Kelly: The Early Years to 1930\\", unpublished manuscript, Princeton University. 1999, p. 4 It was here that Pantaleon took Leon to spend every weekend away from the pressures of business and from the disappointments in his failing marriage. Idyllic and peaceful memories of the farm stayed with Leon and embued his work with a love of nature that emerged later in the Lunar Series, in Return and Departure, and in the insect imagery of his Surrealist work. \\"If anything,\\" he once said,\\"I am a Pantheist and see a spirit in everything, the grass, the rocks, everything.\\" At thirteen, Leon left school and began private painting lessons with Albert Jean Adolphe, a teacher at the School of Industrial Art (now the University of the Arts) in Philadelphia. He learned technique by copying the works of the old masters and visiting the Philadelphia Zoo, where he would draw animals. Drawings done in 1916 and 1917 of elephants, snakes and antelope, as well as copies of old master paintings by Holbein and Michelangelo, heralded an impressive emerging talent. In 1917, he studied sculpture with Alexander Portnoff but his studies came to an abrupt halt with the start of World War I. Being too young to enlist, he joined the Quartermaster Corp at the Army Depot in Philadelphia, where he served for more than a year loading ships with supplies and, along with other artists, working on drawings for camouflage.Muller, p. 8 By 1920, the family's fortunes drastically changed. His father's business had failed due to the introduction of ready made clothing and his marriage, unhappy from the beginning, dissolved. Broken by circumstance Pantaleon left Philadelphia to begin a wandering existence looking for work leaving Leon to support his mother and grandmother. He found a job in 1920 at the Freihofer Baking Company where he worked nights for the next four years. Under these circumstances Leon continued to develop his skills in drawing and painting and learned of the revolutionary developments in art that were taking place in Paris. During the day he was granted permission to study anatomy at the Philadelphia School of Osteopathy where he dissected a cadaver and perfected his knowledge of the human figure. He also met and studied etching with Earl Horter, a well known illustrator, who had amassed a significant collection of modern art which included work by Brancusi, Matisse, and Cubist works by Picasso and Braque.Sawan, Martica Leon Kelly: An American Surrealist. p. 2) Among the artists around Horter was Arthur Carles, a charismatic and controversial painter who taught at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. Leon enrolled in the Academy in 1922, becoming what Carles described as, \\"his best student\\". In the next three years Leon work ranged from academic studies of plaster casts, to pointillism, to landscapes of Fairmount Park in Philadelphia, as well as a series of pastels showing influences from Matisse to Picasso. Clearly influenced by Earl Horter's collection and Arthur Carles he mastered analytical cubism in works such as The Three Pears, 1923 and 1925 experimented with Purism in Moon Behind the Italian House. In 1925 Kelly was awarded a Cresson Scholarship and on June 14 he left for Europe. = Paris = The first trip to Europe lasted for approximately three and a half months and introduced Kelly to a culture and place where he felt he belonged. Though he returned to the Academy in the Fall, he left for Europe again a few months later to begin a four-year stay in Paris. He moved into an apartment at 19 rue Daguerre in Paris and began an existence intellectually rich but in creature comforts, very poor. \\"I kept a cinderblock over the drain in the kitchen sink to keep the rats out of the apartment\\" he once explained. He frequented the cafes making acquaintances with Henry Miller, James Joyce and the critic Felix Feneon as well as others. His days were split between copying old master paintings in the Louvre and pursuing modernist ideas that were swirling through the work of all the artists around him. The Lake, 1926 and Interior of the Studio, 1927, now in the Newark Museum. Patrons during this time were the police official Leon Zamaran, a collector of Courbets, Lautrecs and others, who began collecting Kelly's work. Another was Alfred Barnes of the Barnes Collection in Philadelphia.Sawan, Martica Leon Kelly: An American Surrealist. p. 5 In 1929 Kelly married a young French woman, Henriette D'Erfurth. She appears frequently in paintings and drawings done between 1928 and the early 1930s. = Philadelphia = The stock market crash of 1929 made it impossible to continue living in Paris and Kelly and Henriette returned to Philadelphia in 1930. He rented a studio on Thompson Street and began working and participating in shows in the city's galleries. Work from 1930 to 1940 showed continuing influences and experimentation with the themes and techniques acquired in Paris as well as a brief foray into Social Realism. The Little Gallery of Contemporary Art purchased the Absinthe Drinker in 1931 and in 1932 exhibited Judgement of Paris, 1932, an ambitious painting with a classical theme. In October 1934, \\"Interior of a Slaughter House\\" and several other works were included in \\"Second Regional Exhibition of Painting and Prints by Philadelphia Artists\\" at the Whitney Museum in New York,Sawan, Martica Leon Kelly: An American Surrealist. p. 87 Kelly joined the Philadelphia Public Works of Art Project and worked on sketches for a mural destined for the School Administration Building. While some sketches survived, one is in the Metropolitan, the mural is lost. The harsh financial conditions of Kelly's life continued and by the late 1930s, Henriette, who spoke no English and whose only companionship outside the home was Helen Lloyd Horter (who spoke French), returned to France permanently When his divorce was finalized, Kelly began seeing Helen Lloyd Horter, a Philadelphia painter and a fellow student at the Academy and who was now the ex-wife of Earl Horter. In 1941 they married. Kelly continued to work in his studio on Brandywine Street in Philadelphia teaching small classes to gain some income. Kelly's study of the masters in the Louvre collection resulted in great admiration for the Renaissance painter Leonardo Da Vinci. His influence is evident in Kelly's notebooks of this time which are full of drawings for World War II battlements and weaponry which echo DaVinci's drawings for the mechanisms of war. He also shared Leonardo's fascination with science and the underlying dynamics of how things work. His interest of the nervous system and sensory aspects of human anatomy would later come important components of his abstract figures of the 1950s and '60s. = Surrealism = In 1942, Kelly moved out of Philadelphia to Helen's summer home in Harvey Cedars on Long Beach Island, New Jersey. In the '40s, Harvey Cedars was a sparsely inhabited outpost. A small artists colony existed during summers in the town but in the winter it was reclaimed by the year round population of clammers, dredgers and fishermen. With its wind swept beaches, open expanses of sky, and undisturbed stretches of marsh, Long Beach Island was the perfect place for Kelly to reconnect with the natural environment he had loved as a child on his father's farm. In the stillness of this place his observations of dragonflies, birds and insects in the garden began to translate into a delicacy of line and a language of shapes that would come to characterize his paintings and especially his drawings. In 1940, Helen Horter had contacted Julien Levy, a Harvard classmate of her brother-in-law Paul Vanderbilt, to propose an exhibition of drawings by Kelly. Levy's gallery, The Julien Levy Gallery on 57th street in New York, was at the forefront of innovation and Surrealism. His stable included: Salvador Dali, Arshile Gorky, Yves Tanguy, Roberto Matta, Max Ernst, Joseph Cornell and Marcel Duchamp.Sawan, Martica Leon Kelly: An American Surrealist. p. 10 Levy was impressed by Kelly's work and began representing him. His first show was an exhibition that travelled to the Art Alliance in Philadelphia in 1941. A one-man show followed in March 1942 in New York. In 1943, the magazine View printed nudes by Kelly and Picasso that resulted in the banning the issue in the US. In 1944, there was a second one-man show at the Julien Levy Gallery.Sawan, Martica Leon Kelly: An American Surrealist. p. 91 One of the hallmarks of Kelly's surrealist work are the enormous mosquitos that stalked the canvases. These gigantic insects and their surroundings are meticulously rendered, giving plausibility to the idea that they may, in fact, exist in some undiscovered landscape. One had only to spend a summer evening outdoors in Southern New Jersey to appreciate that the size of these creatures was in part an allegory for their relentless savagery. While mosquitos dominated Kelly's Surrealist work, other creatures began to appear such as beetles, birds and, later, a horses in a series of drawings made for his daughter Paula, (‚ÄúThe Butterfly Horse, Birth of Pegasus‚Äù, 1952) In 1944 Kelly painted The Plateau of Chess for Julien Levy's exhibit entitled \\"Imagery of Chess\\" which opened December 12, 1944. The concept for the show was formulated by Marcel Duchamp and Levy and they invited 32 artists (the number of chess pieces in a set) to participate.List, Larry. \\" The Imagery of Chess Revisited\\". The Imagery of Chess Revisted. The Isamu Noguchi Foundation and Garden Museum. N.Y. 2005, p.15 The show included new designs for chessmen as well as surreal dreamscapes incorporating chess imagery. On the night of January 6, 1945, a blindfolded chess match was begun with chess master George Koltanowski pitted against several of the artists and Julien Levy himself.List, Larry. \\" The Imagery of Chess Revisited\\". The Imagery of Chess Revisted. The Isamu Noguchi Foundation and Garden Museum. N.Y. 2005, p.17 Kelly, who did not play chess, confined his participation to a painting of a double landscape, the dominant larger one depicting a receding plane marked out as a chessboard surrounded by dark spindly leafless trees and cliffs. Below it was a broader view of the same landscape but on a much smaller scale. As Kelly settled into life on the island his work continued to evolve. His relationship with nature intensified and the impressions from it were woven into the several series of paintings: Return and Departure, and the Lunar series. The Return and Departure series was done in the mid 1940s as a reaction to the seasonal ebb and flow of life on the barrier island, the flow of tides, the migration of birds and butterflies and the influx of summer visitors who retreated again in the Fall. Birds in particular begin to appear in his work as symbolic of the fugitive and ephemeral. \\"Birds and their mystic and silent relationship to the elements. They come and go like the spiritual counterparts of human beings. Down out of infinite space to stand for a moment like the apparition of the soul.\\" He further wrote \\"People who come to me from a thin thread and then leave and in their departure diminish to a fine thread. These paintings were made on the seaboard and relate to a feeling of people coming and going away from a little platform in eternity and infinite space.\\" See \\"Atlantic Pastorale\\", 1944, which is a preliminary sketch for a painting of the same name done in 1945. Abstract representations of figures vary in size and are scattered across the page to denote the appearance of their approach and departure. In 1946 The Whitney purchased two paintings from this period: \\"Departure Under the Umbrellas\\" and \\"Magic Bird\\".Sawan, Martica Leon Kelly: An American Surrealist. p. 95 Though Levy closed his gallery in 1949 and left New York to take up residence in Connecticut, he and Kelly continued a friendship and working relationship through the 1950s. = Peruvian Series = In the Spring of 1946, Kelly took a teaching job at the Brooklyn Museum School. Here he came in contact with their collection of Peruvian textilesand its impact changed his direction for the next several years. Kelly had concluded that American artists had been under the influence of Europe for too long and was looking for another visual tradition that would be closer to the American experience. He found it in the textiles and began studying Peruvian civilization and art. In 1947 he moved west to teach art at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, Wyoming where he stayed for two years. On a Christmas vacation from teaching he traveled to New Mexico to visit family friend Edith Warner and the San Ildefonso Indians. From these influences Kelly merged colors and shapes with cultural references from Indian cultures to come up with his own iconography. Of these paintings he wrote: \\" ...in developing my work from the pre-incaic themes I did not wish to lose or sacrifice in any way contemporary methods or concepts of painting.\\" One of the main characteristics of this phase was the use of flat shadowless shapes similar to those seen in the textiles. He wrote \\"this provided for me an unusual feeling of detachment of the figures and objects from a positive earthly connection.\\" Titles of some of the work done under this influence are: \\"The Priest with Apparition of a Virgin\\", 1949, \\"The Solitary Prince\\", and \\"Priest and the Virgin Weaver of Cuzco\\", 1947. Several works of this period were exhibited at a one-man show at the Hugo Gallery in a New York in 1950. = 1950s and beyond = George Balanchine attended the opening of the show at the Hugo Gallery. Accompanying him was George Volodine, a fellow dancer who had immigrated with him to the United States. Volodine operated a dance school in Westport CT where he prepared students for auditions with the New York City Ballet. Kelly and Volodine struck up a friendship that lasted for over a decade and resulted in collaboration on costume and set designs. Notebooks full of drawings trace the progress for the ballet \\"Flame\\", as well as proposals for other productions. \\"Flame\\" was produced in Westport in 1950. In the 1950s Kelly was often living alone in Harvey Cedars. Strains in his marriage had resulted in the periodic separations from Helen and his daughter Paula. In the 1950s the island was sparsely inhabited, especially during the winter, so the months alone must have seemed very long. The Lunar series was born out of the experience of the quiet nights when Kelly and his dog Rusty would walk down the street to the bay before bed. The moon, as it rose over the flat landscape and cycled through its phases, suggested the shape of the figures that began to populate his canvases. Combined with the delicate line inspired by insects physiology, the lunar figures described an emotional response to the moon's pale nocturnal presence. Kelly's work had come into its own and the various influences of the forties jelled into a distinctive style. In subsequent years his work is distinguished by a quality of drawing that bore out Alfred Barr's opinion in 1944 that \\"Kelly was one of the best American draftsmen\\". The environment of the island provided Kelly with abundant subject matter from still life to bathers who were transformed into abstract frolicking designs reminiscent of the Lunar figures. In 1960 Kelly was awarded the William and Noma Copley Foundation grant and lived for a year in Mallorca, Spain. A trip to North Africa during this time resulted in themes of veiled figures such as those seen in a large drawing \\"The Harem in Generalife\\", 1963, currently in a New York City collection. After leaving the Julien Levy Gallery, Kelly was represented by the Alexander Iolas Gallery in New York and had an exhibition of drawings in Milan in 1952. In 1956 he exhibited with the Edwin Hewitt Gallery in New York. Other gallery affiliations include: Zabriski, The Washburn Gallery, Berry Hill Gallery and currently Francis Naumann Gallery and Betty Krulick Gallery in New York City. In 1981 the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York bought \\"Vista at the Edge of the Sea\\", 1940. Leon died in 1982 at his home on Long Beach Island. Kelly is survived by his daughter Paula Muller and two grandchildren, Pete Muller and Irene Homan.

He is represented by Lori Bookstein Fine Art, New York.  Biography  Hiroyuki Hamada grew up in Japan until the age of eighteen, then moved with his family to Wheeling, West Virginia where his father held a temporary post in the steel industry; the culture shock Hamada experienced was underscored by the linguistic gap, and it was through the study of drawing while in college that Hamada found an outlet to bridge the gap. He changed his major from psychology to studio art, then went on to earn a Masters in Fine Art from the University of Maryland. Hamada has been awarded residencies at the Provincetown Fine Arts Work Center, the Edward F. Albee Foundation/William Flanagan Memorial Creative Person's Center, the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, the MacDowell Colony, Studios Midwest in Illinois, and the Virginia Center of the Creative Arts. In 1998, Hamada was the recipient of a Pollock-Krasner Foundation grant, and in 2009 he was awarded a New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship. The artist lives and works in East Hampton, New York.  Techniques and aesthetics  #63, 2006‚Äì10, 45 x 40 x 24 inches, burlap, enamel, oil, plaster, resin, tar, wax and wood Hiroyuki Hamada is distinguished for achieving extraordinary effects of spatial depth through a time consuming, meticulous process. In his 2007 foreword to an exhibition catalog (Hiroyuki Hamada; Pierre Menard gallery), Edward Albee points out \\"the tough power and the 'here I am, as I am' quality of the work.\\" Hamada transforms non-art materials, enamel, tar, wax, burlap, plastic, into powerful artistic forms, and arranges those industrial and even brutal materials in gentle, smooth shapes. Surfaces are \\"richly textured\\",Tristan Manco, Hiroyuki Hamada in \\"Raw + Material = Found, Scavenged and Upcycled\\", Publisher Thames & Hudson Ltd (UK), April 2012 often marked by sectioning. Cited in Art: A Brief History for his contribution to \\"new ideas in traditional materials,\\" Stokstad notes, \\"There is an archetypal quality to his elemental sculptural forms.They seem strange but at the same time hauntingly familier, remaining open to a variety of viewer associations.\\" The output is a series of non-representational artworks, named by numbers in a sequence. \\"As an artist he tries to ignore outside references, preferring instead for his work to come from a truly interior space. His artwork is a product of the mind, unburdened by the need to think in real world images\\". By objectivizing the idea through two different techniques, painting and sculpture, two opposite fields, Hamada comes to a sort of hegelian synthesis, where the \\"stream of time\\" is itself objectivized within a universal form. Hamada refuses labels, but it seems to be unavoidable not to catch in his figures his Japanese background. The black and white chromatism of some of his works is reminiscent of Japanese calligraphy, and the smoothed dark texture of other pieces recalls an inkstone. Some others that take the shape of a holed circle call to mind the ens≈ç, and all the more so because of the semantics characterizing Hamada's output, which lie in a pre-linguistic world. An inspiration to the designer Damir Doma for his fall/winter 2011 collection, Hamada's works were shown at the opening of L'Atelier Damir Doma Boutique √âph√©m√®re. Referring to Hamada's #55 the designer said, \\"I adore this piece of art for its timelessness. It's hard to define the time and the place it's coming from. There is no clear reference to the piece but I believe it explains my work.

The two sites had been occupied by supporters of President Mohamed Morsi, who had been removed from office by the military a month earlier in the 2013 Egyptian coup d'√©tat. The camps were raided after initiatives to end the six-week sit-ins by peaceful means failed and as a result of the raids the camps were cleared out within hours. The raids were described by Human Rights Watch as crimes against humanity and \\"one of the world's largest killings of demonstrators in a single day in recent history\\". According to Human Rights Watch, a minimum of 904 people were killed (at least 817 in Rabaa Square and at least 87 in al-Nahda Square) with strong evidence to suggest more likely at least 1,000 died during the dispersal. However, according to the Egyptian Health Ministry, 595 civilians and 43 police officers were killed and at least 3,994 were injured. Later, the official Forensic Medical Authority stated only 8 police officers were killed and Egypt's National Council for Human Rights stated at least 624 civilians were killed. The Muslim Brotherhood and the National Coalition for Supporting Legitimacy stated the number of deaths from the Rabaa al-Adawiya Mosque sit-in alone was about 2,600. The total casualty count made 14 August the deadliest day in Egypt since the 2011 Egyptian revolution which had toppled former President Hosni Mubarak. Several world leaders denounced the violence during the sit-in dispersals. Violent retaliation followed in several cities across the country. The military appointed interim government declared a three-month-long state of emergency in response and curfews were instituted in many areas. Background Following the 2011 Egyptian revolution and subsequent instability, millions of Egyptians took to the streets calling for the resignation of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood president, which culminated in the ousting of President Mohamed Morsi. Prior to the anti-Morsi uprising, supporters of the deposed president occupied two squares ‚Äì Rabaa al-Adawiya in Nasr City, Cairo and al-Nahda in Giza ‚Äì originally to celebrate the one-year anniversary of his presidency, but from 3 July onwards to protest his ouster, vowing to remain until Morsi was reinstated. Authorities delayed clearing the two protest camps as internal and external reconciliation process was established to resolve the crisis peacefully. According to the military, the sit-ins were flash points for outbreaks of violence and bloody confrontations amongst pro-Morsi, anti-Morsi demonstrators and security forces. The encampments became a potent symbol of Egypt's impasse as they grew more permanent with stores, barbers and their own television station. Authorities saw the camps as destabilising and disruptive and representing \\"a threat to the Egyptian national security and an unacceptable terrorizing of citizens,\\" accusing the pro-Morsi side of provoking bloodshed to win sympathy and considered the standoff as hindering their view of putting Egypt on a \\"roadmap\\" to restoring civilian democracy, with a new constitution and new elections. The government threatened a raid on the protest camps on multiple occasions. Allegedly, an ultimatum was issued prior to 14 August, although Al- Azhar, Egypt's official Islamic authority, denied that such a warning had been given. The area around the Rabaa al-Adaweya mosque has been packed with Muslim Brotherhood supporters sleeping in tents for over a month before the sit-in was cleared. =Warning= Initiatives that tried to resolve the tension, including foreign-backed efforts by Gulf Arab countries, the E.U. and the U.S.A., failed to yield any positive outcomes before state authorities decreed these a failure and issued the ultimatum. Prime Minister Hazem el-Beblawi warned just ahead of the Muslim Eid al-Fitr holiday that the government's decision to clear the sit-ins was \\"irreversible\\". According to the Interior Ministry, the plan was originally to disperse the six-week-old sit-ins gradually by forming cordons around the two sites as early as dawn Monday, 12 August, allowing protesters to leave but preventing others from getting in, to minimize casualties before using water cannons and tear gas. However, leaked news of the plan prompted thousands of protesters to defiantly flood into two protest camps, prompting police to postpone the move. The protesters had been fortifying the sit-in camps. In Rabaa, men with helmets, sticks and what appeared to be protective sports equipment guarded barricades made of sandbags, truck tires and brick. They also built three concrete waist-high barriers against armored vehicles. Dispersal On 14 August 2013, shortly after 07:00, Egyptian police moved to disperse the camps. According to the Interior Ministry, the plan was originally to stop the protests gradually by cutting off supply lines while providing a safe exit for those who elected to leave. By 8:00 the smaller camp ‚Äì near Cairo University in Giza ‚Äî was cleared of protesters, but it took about 12 hours for police to take control of the main sit-in site near the Rabaa al-Adawiya Mosque that served as the epicenter of the pro-Morsi campaign. Police in riot gear opened fire with tear gas and birdshot. They were supported by bulldozers (to clear barricades), armored vehicles, and rooftop snipers who fired on those trying to flee. Military helicopters swooped low over the encampment and, using loudspeakers, warned the thousands of demonstrators to leave the area along designated routes to safety. For much of the afternoon, thousands of Morsi supporters chanting \\"Allahu Akbar\\" tried to join those besieged by the security forces inside the Nasr City camp. They were driven away when police fired tear gas. All entrances to Rabaa were later blocked by security forces. Brotherhood spokesman Gehad El-Haddad accused police snipers of firing at Rabaa protesters from the rooftop of surrounding buildings and protesters also said that snipers fired down on those trying to flee or reach safety. In the afternoon, the protesters managed to push the police back to the point where they could get into a makeshift hospital. Shortly before dusk, soldiers and police officers renewed their push and protestors were forced to flee. Government forces then seized control, destroying what remained of the protest camp. Immediately after the morning raids, the National Coalition for Supporting Legitimacy, a pro-Morsi group, reiterated its rejection of violence and called on its members to continue to protest \\"to stop the massacre\\". The attacks set off retaliatory clashes and protest marches. Protesters blocked important roads, including the Ring Road, a key route that connects many of Cairo's major districts. Crowds of Morsi supporters marched toward eastern Cairo in the late morning, running into a barrage of gunfire as they confronted police lines. Separately, a number of attacks on police stations occurred around the country. Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim put the number of stations attacked at 21. Angry mobs reportedly also attacked dozens of Christian properties. By nightfall, the military-backed interim government had declared a state of emergency and instituted a curfew. However, protesters established new sit-ins outside Mustafa Mahmoud Mosque in Mohandeseen, Giza and others in cities around the country, defying the new curfew and the interior minister's vows to break up any such assemblies. Initial reports by the Egyptian Health Ministry said 235 protesters, three journalists and 43 policemen died in the violence and more than 2,000 were injured, with the death toll expected to rise. Many protesters or rioters were shot and at least one person appeared to have been burned alive. Egyptian state television aired images showing what appears to be weapons confiscated from the sit-in protesters' camps, including automatic rifles and thousands of rounds of ammunition. An Egyptian free-to-air satellite news television channel aired infrared footage appearing to show pro-Brotherhood rioters firing automatic weapons against security forces. According to some political analysts and historians, the force with which the police attacked the protesters appeared designed to provoke a violent response from supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood. Aftermath The violence then spread across the country as people learned what had happened in Cairo and took to the streets in anger. In the Giza Governorate, an angry mob attacked a police station, one of 21 such attacks according to the interior ministry. In southern Egypt, between two and seven Coptic Christian churches were burned to the ground, according to The New York Times, while the interior ministry said that at least seven Coptic Christian churches had been vandalised or torched by suspected Islamists. One Coptic rights group, Maspero Youth Union (MYU), estimated that as many as 36 churches were \\"completely\\" devastated by fire across nine Egyptian governorates including in Minya, Sohag and Assiut, and many other churches were looted or stormed in ensuing street violence. Christian activists accused Morsi supporters of waging \\"a war of retaliation against Copts in Egypt.\\" According to the government, Muslim Brotherhood supporters attacked government headquarters in several governorates. Supporters of Morsi staged solidarity protests against the crackdown, with clashes reported in Ismailia, Alexandria, Suez, Upper Egypt's Assiyut and Aswan and other places. In defiance of the curfew, Morsi supporters vowed to return to the streets to continue protesting against the crackdown and coup. Egyptian banks and its stock market were closed through 15 August. Rail travel into and out of Cairo was also suspended. In Giza, hundreds of Morsi supporters also set fire to local government offices; the government then authorised the use of live ammunition on anyone attacking state buildings. Tamarod called on its supporters to protest on 16 August and to form neighbourhood watch groups to guard against Morsi supporters; in like measure, Morsi supporters vowed to keep up their campaign to get the deposed president reinstated. The next day, hundreds of Morsi supporters barricaded themselves at the Fateh Mosque in Cairo. After a day, security forces again cleared the demonstrators. The Muslim Brotherhood then reiterated its call to hold continued protests. The Muslim Brotherhood called for a \\"Day of Rage\\" after Friday prayers on 16 August with Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Gehad el-Haddad writing on Twitter: \\"Anti-coup rallies tomorrow will depart from all mosques of Cairo and head towards Ramsis square after Jumaa prayer in 'Friday of Anger'.\\" The party also released a statement that read: \\"Despite the pain and sorrow over the loss of our martyrs, the latest coup makers' crime has increased our determination to end them.\\" By 20 August, the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Mohammed Badie, who had been in hiding, was arrested after being found in a residential flat in Nasr City. Pro-Morsi supporters continued to rally and on 30 August six protesters died. =State of emergency and curfew= Map showing extent of the curfew issued by the interim Egyptian government on 14 August 2013. The interim government declared a month-long state of emergency, commencing at 16:00. By doing so, the right to a trial and due process of the law was suspended. A 19:00 curfew was also declared in 14 of the 27 governorates (Cairo, Giza, Alexandria, Suez, Qena, Ismailia, Asyut, Sohag, Beni Suef, Minya, Beheira, South Sinai, North Sinai and Faiyum). The army promised to enforce the curfew with the \\"utmost firmness.\\" The curfew would be enforced from 19:00‚Äì06:00 for a month, along with the state of emergency. The following day, Egypt's interim cabinet lifted the curfew in the cities of Sharm el-Sheikh, Taba and Dahab in South Sinai to avoid harming tourism. The curfew had started to hurt the Cairo economy after less than a week in place. Starting on 24 August, the interim cabinet decided to shorten the curfew by two hours to 21:00-06:00 excluding Fridays. On 31 August, the curfew was again shortened by another two hours to 23:00-06:00 excluding Fridays where the curfew remained from 19:00-06:00. On 12 September, Egypt's interim government decided to extend the state of emergency for 2 months, until 14 November, along with the curfew which remained unchanged. Starting 21 September, the curfew was again shortened by two hours to 00:00-05:00 excluding Fridays where the curfew was shortened by one hour to 19:00-05:00. On 24 October, the curfew was again shortened by one hour to 01:00-05:00 excluding Fridays where the curfew remained from 19:00-05:00. The state of emergency and curfew was lifted at 16:00 on 12 November, two days earlier than expected, following a ruling by the administrative court. Casualties The bodies of protesters who died during the violent clashes during sit-in dispersal On 14 August, the Egyptian Health Ministry said that at least 600 protesters died and more than 2,000 injured. An additional 43 police officers were killed in the violence, according to the Interior Ministry. The Muslim Brotherhood estimated the death toll at 2,000. Of the dead, 37 were from the town of Fayoum. Many of the dead appeared to be young adults. On 15 August, the Egyptian Health Ministry then raised the death toll to 638 and number of injured to 3,994 from the clashes that broke out the previous day. Of those killed, 595 were protesters, including 377 at Rabaa Al-Adawiya and 90 in al- Nahda Square. It is unclear whether at least a dozen of charred corpses and others that remain unidentified, have been included in the official death toll. However, the Muslim Brotherhood and NCSL put the number of deaths from the Rabaa sit-in alone at a much higher count of 2,600 people. On 12 August 2014, Human Rights Watch stated in a report based on a year-long investigation that in 14 August dispersal of the Rabaa al-Adawiya sit-in alone, security forces, following a plan that envisioned several thousand deaths, killed a minimum of 817 people and more likely at least 1,000. Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, said that \\"in Rab'a [sic] Square, Egyptian security forces carried out one of the world's largest killings of demonstrators in a single day in recent history\\" and that \\"this wasn't merely a case of excessive force or poor training. It was a violent crackdown planned at the highest levels of the Egyptian government\\". Many deaths were also reported in Giza. Workers of al-Iman mosque state the ministry \\"won't acknowledge\\" in their official death toll tally over 200 charred bodies that had been moved to the mosque from a protest camp nearby. At al-Iman mosque in Nasr City the next day, hundreds of bodies were still on the floor of a makeshift morgue and wrapped in shrouds and kept cool with blocks of ice, some bodies also bore gunshot wounds and many were charred beyond recognition. Among the dead was the daughter of Mohamed el-Beltagy, a prominent Muslim Brotherhood member. =Attack on journalists= During the dispersal, journalists covering the event were trapped. Four of them were killed, while others were injured or detained. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, it was the deadliest day for journalists in Egypt since the organization began keeping records in 1992. Veteran Sky News camera operator Michael \\"Mick\\" Deane, 61, was killed. Deane was an experienced journalist who had previously worked for CNN before working for Sky News for 15 years. Photos of Deane's body showed that he was wearing a helmet that clearly identified him as a journalist. The CPJ said Deane was the 1000th journalist it had confirmed killed worldwide. Egyptian journalist Habiba Ahmed Abd Elaziz, 26, worked for Gulf News publication XPRESS newspaper, was shot and killed. Egyptian reporter Ahmed Abdel Gawad, who was with the Al-Akhbar state-run newspaper and was an editorial manager for the Muslim Brotherhood television satellite channel Misr 25, was shot in the back and killed. Rassd News Network (RNN) photojournalist Mosab El-Shami was also killed. Among the journalists most seriously injured were Al-Watan editor Tariq Abbas, who was shot in the face, and Al-Masry Al-Youm photojournalist Alaa al-Qamhawy, who was shot in the foot. Among the detained journalists were Al-Jazeera journalist Abdullah al-Shami and Al Jazeera Media Network's Mubasher Misr photographers Emad Eddin Al-Sayed and Abdulrahman Al-Mowahhed-Bellah, and Freedom and Justice Party (Egypt) (Al-Hurrya wa Al-Adala) / Misr 25 journalist Radwa Al-Selawi. Previously during the 2013 political violence in Egypt, photojournalist Ahmed Assem el-Senousy was killed on 8 July 2013 as a result of sniper fire, while covering a protest. In total, five journalists were killed since political violence erupted after July 2013. Egypt's State Information Service released a statement on 17 August critical of news coverage from foreign journalists: \\"Media coverage has steered away from objectivity and neutrality which has led to a distorted image that is very far from the facts... Egypt is feeling severe bitterness towards some western media coverage that is biased to the Muslim Brotherhood and ignores shedding light on violent and terror acts that are perpetrated by this group.\\" The United Nations said about the sit-in dispersal that there had been \\"serious violations of human rights law\\", including the killing of journalists, after UNESCO's Director-General Irina Bokova had already condemned the killing earlier of journalist el-Senousy in July. The International Press Institute demanded that Egypt be held responsible for violations of journalists' rights and the Egyptian military's targeting of the press corps. NCHR investigation The Egyptian National Council for Human Rights's investigation blamed both the police and protestors for the incident. The investigation mainly blamed the police for using excessive force, and protestors for being armed. The NCHR blamed security forces for using excessive gunfire and failing to protect peaceful protestors during the crackdown on the sit-in killing hundreds. According to the report, gunmen inside the sit-in shot fire at police officers, provoking a violent response from police and escalating the violence. Reactions =Domestic= Mostafa Hegazy, a spokesperson for Egypt's interim government, said: \\"We're not into the effort of dissolving anyone ‚Äì or preventing anyone from being active in the public domain, but we're trying to make sure that everyone is legalised according to what the Egyptian law says...\\" He added that the country was facing a war waged by \\"terrorist forces.\\" Interim Vice President Mohamed ElBaradei resigned in protest at the crackdown saying his conscience was troubled over the loss of life \\"particularly as I believe it could have been avoided. It has become too difficult to continue bearing responsibility for decisions I do not agree with and whose consequences I fear.\\" He added that the \\"state of polarisation and grave division... the social fabric is threatened as violence breeds violence.\\" He was then charged by a Cairo court with \\"breaching national trust;\\" the charge of treason could carry a 25,910EGP (US$1,430) fine if convicted. It followed a complaint that his resignation gives the international community a false impression of unity of the state as it \\"contradicts reality.\\" However, after his resignation he left the country for Vienna. Interim Prime Minister Hazem el-Beblawi defended the state's reactions and praised the security forces saying that \\"we found that matters had reached a point that no self respecting state could accept...the spread of anarchy and attacks on hospitals and police stations.\\" He also recommended the dissolution of the Muslim Brotherhood. He further noted that Egypt was headed in the \\"right direction\\" and that he did \\"not fear civil war.\\" In reaction to consideration of cutting aid funds from the U.S. and the EU, he defiantly said that it would be \\"a bad sign\\" in cutting of aid, but that while that would \\"badly affect the military for some time,\\" Egypt would survive as \\"let's not forget that Egypt went with the Russian military for support and we survived. So, there is no end to life. You can live with different circumstances.\\" It also follows Saudi Arabia's promise to fill in the aid vacuum. On 17 August, presidential advisor Mostafa Hegazy said: \\"We are facing a war launched by extremist forces escalating every day to a terrorist war. Forces of extremism intend to cripple our journey towards pure bright future, aiming and willing to bring to the whole state into total failure.\\" Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy condemned suggestion of cutting aid to Egypt and added that the government would not abandon its efforts to restore order \\"\\"We keep hearing if Egypt doesn‚Äôt do this or doesn‚Äôt do that, then aid will be stopped here or will be stopped there. If one side is revising aid they are giving, we are revising aid we receive as well.\\" He also said in light of international criticism of the move: \\"The attempts to internationalize the discussions about this event is something that Egypt rejects. I ask the foreign ministry to review the foreign aid of the past and to see if those aids are used in an optimal way.\\" In the wake of continued protests and violence, army chief Abdel Fattah el- Sisi said that he would no longer restrain his forces from confronting \\"attackers who want to destroy Egypt.\\" He added: > Our self-restraint will not continue. We will not accept any more attacks. > We will meet with full force. Attackers want to destroy Egypt. Whoever > imagines violence will make the state and Egyptians kneel must reconsider; > we will never be silent in the face of the destruction of the country. > [There is] room for everyone [and the security services would not] conspire > [to take power]. The will of the Egyptian people is free, their will is > free, they can choose whoever they want to rule them, and we are the > guardians of this will. The army and the police right now are the guardians > of the will of the people with regard to choosing who their leaders will be. > I said previously that Egyptians if they want to change the world, they are > capable of that, and I tell the Egyptian people now that if you want to > build Egypt and its future, you will and you can, and you can make it 'Egypt > the mother of all nations' Egypt will be as big as the world itself, with > God's will. Egyptian state television stated that the protest camps had been cleared \\"in a highly civilised way,\\" while the interim government released a statement praising the \\"brave\\" security forces and blaming armed protesters present in the sit-in for the loss of life. The government also called the raids necessary and said police had confiscated guns and other weapons from the camps. The government renewed its promise to pursue an army-backed political transition plan in \\"a way that strives not to exclude any party\\". Egyptian Ambassador to the UK Ashraf el-Kholy defended the dispersal and blamed the Muslim Brotherhood for causing the difficulties, saying: \\"Of course they did nothing but return fire. If you have somebody firing at you then you have to respond.\\" Party spokesman Mona al-Qazzaz said: > This is not a government, this is not a regime, this is a mafia...They > failed at every single democratic process, and they came on the back of the > tanks as leaders...This is an illegitimate mafia that has hijacked the power > of Egypt...They would have to pay the price of their crimes against > humanity. They are the illegal people, we have won at every single > democratic process and they have lost, and the only way for them to be back > in the political arena is through the power of the bullets and tanks. Grand Imam Ahmed el-Tayeb called for \\"restraint\\", saying Al-Azhar is committed to seeking a political solution to the situation. He also urged all political factions to respond to the national reconciliation efforts and said that he had no prior knowledge of the crackdown efforts. The Coptic Church condemned the attacks on its churches and called on the army to restore order. El-Tayeb and el-Baradei were among other advocated of the ouster of Morsi who later were seen to express at least a modicum of sympathy for the protesters due to the heavy-handed nature of the dispersal. The al-Nour Party called on protestors to exhibit restraint, but said the dispersals would further complicate the political process. The April 6 Youth Movement blamed \\"the army, interior ministry and the Muslim Brotherhood\\" for the violence. There were also reactions on social media. The New Wafd Party said it was the government's duty to the sit-ins since the mandate to fight violence and terrorism on 26 July. It added that while the right of peaceful protest and freedom of expression is guaranteed, the protesters at both squares were not peaceful protesters and were hiding weapons; it further accused the Muslim Brotherhood of being responsible for the unrest in the country with its allegedly inciting speeches, defiance of the state and disrespect of the will of what they suggested was a majority of the people and of the army that deepened the polarisation. Former presidential candidate Amr Moussa said that \\"the whole Egyptian society should stand against any attempt to raise strife on the current incidents.\\" The founder of the Free Egyptians Party Naguib Sawiris said: \\"Decision to disperse MB sit-ins was crucial\\" and that no one accepts sit-ins that block the roads and hinder economic development. Popular Current leader and former presidential candidate Hamdeen Sabahi said: \\"We support people, army, police against terrorism\\" and wrote on Twitter, \\"We will support our people, army and police against the terrorism of those who monopolized the people's will.\\" Former presidential candidate Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh added that was in touch with senior state officials and had asked them to take the necessary decision to stop the bloodshed immediately as it could drag the country into a wave of violence and chaos. The Dawaa Salafya called on the cabinet to resign and issued a statement that condemned the violent clashes and warned against dragging the country into mobilisation of both sides, which would negatively affect social cohesion. The foreign ministry also formed a working group of senior officials to follow up on foreign reactions to the crisis and would supply Egyptian embassies with the requisite details and follow up on foreign media coverage of the events, according to the interior ministry. The Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies condemned the apparent use of excessive force and lethal violence by Egyptian security forces when dispersing the sit-in of protestors at Rabaa al- Adawiya and Nahda squares. In a statement, the institute said \\"The action left hundreds dead and thousands seriously injured, as well as dozens of bodies torched in still unexplained circumstances. We believe the security apparatus could have avoided this human tragedy if it had complied with international rules and standards for the dispersal of assemblies. Moreover, in the past weeks, the security authorities have failed to do their duty to take the necessary legal measures to protect public security and citizens, particularly residents and passersby in the aforementioned two areas\\" In October 2013, Egyptian Kung-Fu gold medalist Mohamed Youssef was recalled from Russia and given a one-year suspension from all national and international competitions for wearing a T-shirt containing the Rabia sign. In November 2013, Al-Ahly's Ahmed Abd El-Zaher was deprived of his Champions League win bonus, suspended and put up for sale in the January transfer window for a gesture in support of Morsi. On 5 December 2013, the Egyptian Football Association took sanctions a step further, announcing that Abd El-Zaher has been banned from representing Egypt for one year in addition to a 3-month local ban. =International= ;Rights groups On 10 December, thirteen Egyptian and international human rights organizations urged Cairo's interim authorities to probe the violence during the sit-in dispersal in the capital on 14 August. The joint call issued by organizations that included Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, said an investigation must be launched into the killing of \\"up to 1,000 people by security forces\\" almost four months ago when they dispersed sit-ins by supporters of deposed president Mohamed Morsi. \\"There can be no hope for the rule of law and political stability in Egypt, much less some modicum of justice for victims, without accountability for what may be the single biggest incident of mass killing in Egypt's recent history,\\" said Gasser Abdel-Razak, associate director at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. \\"As a first step toward accountability, the government should establish an effective independent fact- finding committee to investigate responsibility throughout the chain of command for the unlawful killings,\\" the rights groups said. They said that on 14 August a \\"small minority of protesters used firearms... but the police responded excessively by shooting recklessly, going far beyond what is permitted under international law.\\" \\"After the unprecedented levels of violence and casualties seen since the ousting of Mohamed Morsi, investigations must provide real answers and cannot be another whitewash of the security forces' record,\\" Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui of Amnesty International said in the statement. \\"Egypt's authorities cannot deal with the carnage through PR in world's capitals, rewriting events and locking up Morsi's supporters.\\" The groups also said the probe should determine whether there is any evidence of a policy to kill protesters or commit other serious crimes. ;Supranational bodies *African Union ‚Äì The AU was to send a panel consisting of former Malian president Alpha Oumar Konare, former Botswana President Festus Mogae and former Djibouti Prime Minister Dileita Mohamed Dileita, amongst others, to help find a resolution to the conflict. The panel was in Egypt from the end of July to early August. AU spokesman El Ghassim Wane said: \\"We have formally written to the Egyptian interim authorities to inform them of the intention of the panel to come back to Egypt, and we look forward to the cooperation of both the interim authorities and all Egyptians. The plans are for the panel to go back to Egypt as early as [this] week. The Peace and Security Council has urged that preparations be expedited for the panel to go back to Egypt. Further polariSation of the situation in Egypt or escalation of violence will have far-reaching implications both for Egypt, the region and the African continent as a whole. And this is why the AU is making sustained efforts to contribute to the ongoing efforts, based of course, on the ownership by the Egyptian stakeholders themselves.\\" * ‚Äì President Herman van Rompuy and European Commission President Jose Barroso said in a joint statement: \\"Together with its member states, the EU will urgently review in the coming days its relations with Egypt and adopt measures aimed at pursuing [the goals of promoting an] end to violence, resumption of political dialogue and return to a democratic process. Further escalation must be prevented. It could have unpredictable consequences for Egypt and for its broader neighborhood.\\" Just before EU foreign ministers were scheduled to meet, they also warned Egypt's army and interim government that it was ready to \\"review\\" ties failing an end to violence and return to dialogue. They two issued statements that read further escalation could have \\"unpredictable consequences\\" for Egypt and the region. \\"The calls for democracy and fundamental freedoms from the Egyptian population cannot be disregarded, much less washed away in blood. In co-operation with its international and regional partners, the EU will remain firmly engaged in efforts to promote an end to violence, resumption of political dialogue and return to a democratic process. To this effect, together with its member states, the EU will urgently review in the coming days its relations with Egypt and adopt measures aimed at pursuing these goals.\\" High Representative for Foreign Policy Catherine Ashton released a statement that read: \\"Confrontation and violence is not the way forward to resolve key political issues. I deplore the loss of lives, injuries and destruction in Cairo and other places in Egypt. I call on the security forces to exercise utmost restraint and on all Egyptian citizens to avoid further provocations and escalation.\\" Her spokesman, Michael Mann, said that \\"the reports of deaths and injuries are extremely worrying. We reiterate that violence won't lead to any solution and we urge the Egyptian authorities to proceed with utmost restraint.\\" Envoy Bernardino Le√≥n said: \\"No options are being ruled out today. We are discussing responses to the current discussion in a very open-minded way.\\" Foreign Ministers of the bloc were expected to meet on 21 August to discuss how to get the Egyptian junta to resort to find a peaceful compromise to the impasse. He suggested option that could include cutbacks in Europe's 5 billion euro package of grants and loans promised last year, as well as a possible arms embargo The European Union restricted exports of security equipment and arms to Egypt, while Ashton said that aid would remain in place to the most \\"vulnerable\\" groups and to civil society. She also said that the member states were reassessing their export licenses. * ‚Äì Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's spokesman Martin Nesirky said: \\"In the aftermath of today's violence, the secretary-general urges all Egyptians to concentrate their efforts on promoting genuinely inclusive reconciliation. [While the United Nations was still gathering information,] it appears that hundreds of people were killed or wounded in clashes between security forces and demonstrators.\\" He added that \\"the secretary-general is alarmed by ongoing developments in Egypt and the widespread outbreak of violent protests and excessive use of force in handling them,\\" and that attacks against churches, hospitals and other public facilities were condemned \\"which he finds unacceptable.\\" :The U.K., with France and Australia, called for an emergency closed-door meeting of the UN Security Council. :The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights leader Navi Pillay demanded an \\"independent, impartial and credible\\" probe into the dispersals and said that anyone found guilty of wrongdoing should be held to account. Spokeswoman Liz Throssell followed up the comments in saying that the office sought to human rights observers to Egypt after government approval. \\"We're calling to have human-rights officers allowed on the ground in Egypt so they can gather information, they can talk to NGOs, national human-rights institutions, draw up reports.\\" ;States * ‚Äì An unnamed government agency condemned the \\"killing of civilian protesters\\" and expressed hope that \\"our brothers and sisters in Egypt to find a peaceful political solution soon.\\" **The Taliban condemned the violence and called for the restoration of Morsi as president. It issued a statement signed by the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan that called on international organisations to take practical steps to stop the violence and \\"not be satisfied with only condemning this barbaric incident.\\" * ‚Äì An unknown government agency in the country that held the rotating presidency of the UN Security Council at the time of the incident condemned it. A statement read: \\"The brutal repression against popular protests that won the streets of the main cities of Egypt...[the authorities should] totally and immediately cease the spiral of violence loosed in recent days against unarmed citizens.\\" * ‚Äì Facing its own uprising, an unnamed government agency called the dispersals necessary to \\"restore security, stability and public order.\\" The state-owned Bahrain News Agency added that Bahraini authorities urged dialogue and reconciliation. * ‚Äì The Itamaraty issued a press release condemning the alleged repressive brutality shown by Egyptian authorities. The ministry further stated that \\"Brazil associates itself with the statements made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in the sense that violence and incitement are not answers to the challenges Egypt faces.\\" It also \\"calls for dialogue and conciliation,\\" while saying that the dispersal is a \\"serious degradation of the security situation in a key country for the stability in the region.\\" * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Kristian Vigenin condemned the \\"excessive use of force, leading to casualties on both sides\\". He said that violence \\"cannot solve the political and social problems accumulated throughout the years\\". * ‚Äì Foreign Minister John Baird issued a statement calling for calm and said that he was deeply concerned by the situation, while calling on Egypt to implement reforms to ease tensions. He also said that Canada's stance is that Egypt should have a transparent democratic system and encourages and respects civil society and all the segments of Egyptian society. \\"We urge both parties to avoid violence, and engage in a meaningful political dialogue for the good of all Egyptians. All Egyptians should show restraint and resolve in the coming days.\\" * ‚Äì The Chancellery issued a press release that read, \\"the Government of the Republic of Colombia deplores the loss of human life and expresses solidarity with the families of the victims of the violent acts that occurred, in the Arab Republic of Egypt, in the past few days.\\" It also \\"calls for all political actors and the Egyptian society to build a political dialog for the benefit of stability and prosperity of the country and the region\\" and \\"orders a cease to the violent acts committed by the public force that deters the safety of citizens and foreigners in Egypt.\\" It added that it was ready to assist its citizens in Egypt through the embassy in Cairo and would seek to move its citizens from Egypt to Istanbul. * ‚Äì An unnamed government agency said that it has suspended 30 million kroner worth of aid, which was channelled via agencies like the World Bank and the International Labour Organization. * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said that all options would be considered at an EU foreign ministers' meeting, including a possible suspension of aid. He also said that France had increased its alert level for Egypt on 16 August which would be \\"formally discouraging\\" French people from traveling to the country.

I was hoping that the squares where the sit-ins took place would empty out once the parties had reached an agreement, and not through the intervention of the police, which doesn't make it any easier to find a solution to the political crisis. I appeal to all the Egyptian forces to do everything in their power to halt the violence that has erupted there, and to avoid a blood bath. All forces of order must exert the maximum self-control, and everyone must likewise avoid any form of incitement to violence.\\" * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh said: \\"Jordan stands by Egypt in its serious efforts to impose the rule of law and restore security and stability\\". **The Muslim Brotherhood's political arm, the Islamic Action Front, called for renewed protests in support of Morsi and warned Egypt's military that it had fallen into a \\"conspiracy\\" hatched by the U.S. and Israel to weaken Muslims and that the military was a \\"tool for corrupt and tyrant military regimes.\\" It also called on its local supporters to protest outside the Egyptian embassy in Amman. * ‚Äì A member of the General National Congress' Foreign Affairs Committee, Amna Amtair, said that the committee would meet the next day to take important measures regarding the Egyptian situation, but were postponed from meeting on the day itself due to damage done by a renegade group of young Amazigh who broke into the GNC following a demonstration.

It also called for dialogue between all parties so as to prevent Egypt from \\"slipping into violence, division and chaos.\\" * ‚Äì President Abdullah Gul said: \\"An armed intervention against civilian people who stage protests is unacceptable, regardless of its justification.\\" He also compared the incident to the first salvos of the Syrian civil war. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's office issued a statement that read: \\"It is clear that the international community, by supporting the military coup and remaining silent over previous massacres instead of protecting democracy and constitutional legitimacy in Egypt, has encouraged the current administration to carry out today's intervention. The international community, especially the UN Security Council and the Arab League, must act immediately to stop this massacre.\\" It also announced that Erdogan had spoken to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and the permanent representatives of the UN Security Council in regards to the Egyptian issue. Egypt then withdrew its ambassador to Turkey for \\"consultations.\\" * ‚Äì An unnamed government agency issued a statement that read: \\"What is regretful is that political extremist groups have insisted on the rhetoric of violence, incitement, disruption of public interests and undermining of the Egyptian economy, which has led to the regretful events today.\\" * ‚Äì Foreign Secretary William Hague issued a statement that read: \\"I am deeply concerned at the escalating violence and unrest in Egypt. I condemn the use of force in clearing protests and call on the security forces to act with restraint.\\" It was also announced that the country had advised its citizens in the country not to partake in demonstrations and avoid large gatherings. He later said that aid to Egypt should be reviewed without precluding future assistance. \\"We have to stick to those principles ... of supporting institutions, not taking sides, of promoting dialogue and of keeping faith with the majority of people.\\" * ‚Äì President Barack Obama \\"strongly condemned\\" the dispersal of pro- Morsi sit-ins. He also said: \\"We sustain our commitment to Egypt and its people... but our traditional cooperation cannot continue as usual,\\" while he also announced the cancellation of the Bright Star military exercises between the U.S. and other Arab states. Despite his condemnation, aid to Egypt remained in place. A spokesperson said the US$1.5billion of aid the United States gives to Egypt annually was under review. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said: \\"The world is watching what is happening in Cairo. We urge the government of Egypt ‚Äì and all parties in Egypt ‚Äì to refrain from violence and resolve their differences peacefully. We have repeatedly called on the Egyptian military and security forces to show restraint and for the government to respect the universal rights of its citizens, just as we have urged protesters to demonstrate peacefully.\\" He added that the United States strongly opposed the state of emergency. Secretary of State John Kerry called the events \\"deplorable\\" and a \\"serious blow\\" to reconciliation efforts. On 15 August, President Obama canceled joint military training exercises with the Egyptian military. * ‚Äì President Nicolas Maduro condemned the violence two days later and announced his decision to recall the ambassador to Egypt and leave the commercial attache in charge of the embassy. He added that despite political differences with the Muslim Brotherhood, \\"we alerted very early on that the coup against president Morsi was unconstitutional and illegal. President Morsi is kidnapped and is the constitutional president of Egypt...The imperialist hands that are reaching into Egypt are responsible for the bloodbath.\\" * ‚Äì An unnamed government agency said on 22 August that it had deep concern over the escalation of violence and called on all related parties to exercise restraint. The Nordic countries also advised against travel to Egypt as tour operators began cancelling trips to the country and bringing back those already in the country. ;Outside protests Hundreds of people protested in favor of the Brotherhood and Morsi in Kuwait and chanted slogans against then-general Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, while an unnamed cleric called on Kuwaitis to protest after Friday prayers outside of the U.S. embassy. Other protests were held in Tel Aviv and Gaza, as well as Turkey, Tunisia and Jordan. In Ankara, about 300 protesters gathered outside the Egyptian embassy, then went to the U.S. embassy and chanted anti-U.S. slogans and held up pictures of Morsi. In Vienna, about 500 demonstrators, most of them Egyptians, gathered in St. Stephens Square, chanting Morsi's name. Organiser Ali Ibrahim of the Egyptian Community in Austria said that the protest was not in support of Morsi but \\"for democracy and the protection of freedom.\\" After Friday prayers, thousands of protesters gathered in several cities across Indonesia, calling for an end to any violence in Egypt. At a sit-in near the Egyptian embassy in Algiers, dozens of Egyptians, mostly students, protested against violence and denounced the events as \\"against the Egyptian people.\\" ;Media The New York Times called the dispersal the \\"clearest sign yet that the old Egyptian police state was re-emerging\\" and added that its reporters saw no evidence of weapon stockpiles in the protest camps. Al Jazeera featured an article entitled \\"The Egyptian coup and the lessons of Turkey\\" with the sub- heading that military was backtracking on the democracy that Egyptians had fought for. International commentators asked if this could lead Egypt into a civil war or even make the country a failed state. Al Jazeera suggested that the Egypt conflict divided the U.S. and its other \\"longtime\\" regional partners over their stance on the issue. Qatari-owned Al Jazeera also singled out Qatar as an exception to Gulf Arab reactions in a supportive stance to the ones who ousted Morsi. It also highlighted the Gulf Arab reversion for the Muslim Brotherhood as a potential destabiliser to its own regimes. Bloomberg suggested the U.S. was in bind as its regional allies were supporting different sides in Egypt. It also drew parallels for foreign support for Syrian rebels amongst its allies, yet different sides in the Egyptian conflict. It quoted Brian Katulis, a foreign policy analyst at the Center for American Progress, who said: \\"What we‚Äôre seeing in the Middle East is a competition for power and influence among the key states that are wealthier and have more resources. What Qatar and Turkey say is almost a 180-degree opposite of what the Emirates and the Saudis are saying publicly.\\" ;Financial markets Egyptian shares fell the most in two months. The benchmark EGX 30 Index slumped 3.9 percent, the most since 12 June to 5,334.55 at the 1:30 p.m. close in Cairo. About 332 million Egyptian pounds ($48 million) of shares traded, compared with a one-year daily average of 391 million pounds. Commercial International Bank Egypt SAE, the country‚Äôs biggest publicly traded lender, led a list of 29 decliners with a 5.4 percent dive. ;Other *The Muslim Brotherhood's media office in London issued a statement that read the world \\"cannot sit back and watch while innocent men, women and children are being indiscriminately slaughtered. The world must stand up to the military junta's crime before it is too late.\\" Rabia sign alt=A black hand on yellow background, with four upright fingers, thumb is folded toward the palm as if one were showing the number four. \\"R4BIA\\" is written across underside of wrist in yellow. As a result of the dispersal of the sit-ins, the Rabia sign (or R4BIA as some supporters call it) emerged widely among the pro-Morsi and pro- Brotherhood masses as a part of a protest campaign against the post-Morsi governmental authorities. The origin of the sign is unclear. Raba'a means \\"fourth\\" in Arabic and the symbol was named after the Rabaa al-Adawiya square. Some credit its invention to Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, then Prime Minister of Turkey.

Eucacopines differ from the other main group of dissorophids, the Dissorophinae, in having more lightly built skeletons and more knobby skulls. The subfamily was originally named Cacopinae, but since the name was already established for a group of living microhylid frogs in 1931, the name was changed to Eucacopinae in 2013. Eucacopinae is a stem-based taxon defined as the most inclusive clade containing the species Cacops apsidephorus but not Dissorophus multicinctus, which belongs to Dissorophinae. According to the most recent phylogenetic analyses of Dissorophidae, Eucacopinae includes the basal (\\"primitive\\") species Conjunctio multidens and Scapanops neglecta from the southwestern United States and a more derived (\\"advanced\\") group including several species of Cacops (also from the southwestern United States) and the Russian genera Kamacops and Zygosaurus. Derived eucacopines have two rows of bony plates called osteoderms running down their backs, while the more basal eucacopines have only a single row. Dissorophines also have a double row of osteoderms but probably evolved them independently because the most recent common ancestor of the two groups had a single row of osteoderms.

Although the decision for them to leave their ancestral home and relocate to a land where they will be secluded from the rest of the people weren't accepted by them, but knowing what is at stake, they had to embark on the journey to protect their territory.

Biography  Ziaja was educated in the faculty of painting and graphic arts at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, and graduated with an honours degree in 1979. Her unique vision of contemporary art comes from her love of Italian art from Trecento to Cinquecento,from Masaccio to Vittore Carpaccio fused with her Polish heritage and paintings of Zygmunt Waliszewski and Eugeniusz Zak. Her concepts are an expression of poetry and personal contemplation, from the melancholic to sometimes bitter reflection. Ziaja's paintings present a psychological abstract of human fate; a depiction of multifaceted personalities inexorable linked in everyday complexities, portraying the individualism of the world.

It was built between 1964 and 1967 and was commissioned into the Soviet navy on 5 November 1967.Podvodnye Lodki, Yu.V. Apalkov, Sankt Peterburg, 2002, It later served as INS Chakra in the Indian Navy from 1988 to 1991. It was leased to India on 1 September 1987 and reached its base in Visakhapatnam on 3 February 1988 after a long journey. The Soviets said that the submarine was transferred for helping train the Indian Navy in operating nuclear submarines. During its service with India, it was partially manned by a Soviet crew, who reportedly did not allow Indians into the missile room and into the reactor compartment and this is believed to be a reason for the termination of the contract after 3 years. The lease of Chakra reportedly helped India gain first-hand experience in handling a nuclear submarine that helped them build the of nuclear submarines.  Description  K-43 had a length of overall, a beam of and a draft of . It displaced surfaced and while submerged. The complement of the submarine was about 100. The boat had one five-blade propeller powered by a VM-5 pressurised water reactor. It can achieve a maximum speed of when surfaced and when submerged. The K-43 could carry up to 8 SS-N-7 Starbright nuclear capable anti-ship cruise missiles. It had six torpedo tubes which could carry 12 torpedoes or 12 SS-N-15 Starfish anti-submarine missiles.  History  In October 1986, the Soviet Politburo declared that they intend to transfer a Charlie-class submarine to India for training purposes. It was the first time a nuclear submarine was ever transferred to any other country. It was decided so as to prove Soviet Union's commitment to strengthening India. But some politicians expressed serious negative consequences due to the transfer. However, the politburo headed by Gorbachev decided that the political benefits outweighs the concerns. The Soviets, during the lease to India, would regularly inspect the submarine and handle the nuclear fuel. The Soviet media stated that the submarine would not carry any nuclear weapons. = Transfer to India = A new naval base was constructed at Visakhapatnam with the help of the Soviet Union for handling the submarine. An Indian crew reached a training centre at Kirova for a two- year training course. The Indian Ambassador, Nurul Hasan, visited the Indian crew during this time.  Operational history  The submarine was built between 1964 and 1967 and was commissioned into the Soviet navy on 5 November 1967. After returning to the Soviet Union after its lease to India, it continued to be in service with the Soviet Navy and was finally decommissioned on 30 July 1992 and sold for scrap. = Service in the Indian Navy = The submarine left for India on 5 January 1988 from Vladivostok and was commissioned into the Indian Navy on the same day. It passed through the South China Sea and Malacca Strait where it was escorted by an Indian frigate, . It was constantly tracked by American and Australian P-3 Orion aircraft throughout the journey. It arrived at Visakhapatnam on 2 February 1988. The submarine was welcomed by the Indian Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, the Defence Minister, K. C. Pant, the Chief of Naval Staff, G. J. Nadkami, and the commander of Eastern Naval Command, Vice Admiral S. C. Chopra, who sailed in the submarine into the sea. Chakra took part in the Presidential Fleet Review of 15 February 1989 at Mumbai when it was watched by millions of Indians on television. Transfer of the submarine gained widespread coverage in the international media with Time Magazine calling India an \\"Awakening Power\\", while the Washington Post called it an \\"Oriental Bully\\". Contrary to popular perception, the Chakra was partially manned and control by the Soviet crew, who reportedly did not allow Indians into the missile room and into the reactor compartment despite repeated Indian requests and efforts, and this is believed to be a reason for the termination of the contract after 3 years by India. The Chakra served in both the eastern and western fronts during her service. As the lease agreement ended, Chakra departed to the Soviet Union from Visakhapatnam on 16 December 1990 and was escorted by throughout its journey. It was decommissioned in January 1991. For the longer term, the lease of Chakra reportedly helped India gain first-hand experience in handling a nuclear submarine that helped them build the of nuclear submarines in 2010s.

She is the first ship ever built with an asymmetric hull that allows her to operate not only ahead and astern, but also obliquely (sideways) with a large angle of attack. In this way, the relatively small oblique icebreaker is capable of opening a wide channel in ice for large merchant ships. The vessel was initially scheduled for delivery to FGI Gosmorspassluzhba, the Russian Marine Emergency Rescue Service, in early 2014. However, she remained moored at Kaliningrad until late 2014, when the vessel was towed to St. Petersburg, and was finally accepted to service in December 2014.Rosmorrechflot accepts into service oblique icebreaker Baltika. PortNews, 30 December 2014.  Development and construction  The development of the oblique icebreaker concept dates back to 1997, when the engineers at Kv√¶rner Masa-Yards Arctic Technology Centre (MARC) came up with a new way of assisting large tankers in ice-infested waters. Traditionally, escorting large ships up to wide required two conventional icebreakers with a beam of , a practice that was not very efficient and economical. The solution was a triangle-shaped vessel with three azimuth thrusters in the \\"corners\\" pushing the asymmetric hull with a 50-degree angle of attack‚Äîalmost sideways‚Äîin ice to open a channel behind the vessel. Model tests in an ice tank showed that the proposed concept was feasibleThe Oblique Icebreaker. ABS Surveyor Summer 2005, page 15. and the concept was patented.Arpiainen, M. et al.

With Furst joined by Paul A. Birkett and Eric Forsberg for screenwriting, the film premiered on Syfy on August 22, 2013. Despite being panned critically, the movie had some success attracting attention from social media due to its fantastical premise, with websites such as Vulture.com commenting on moments from the film. A supposed sequel, Ghost Shark 2: Urban Jaws, was released on 1 July 2015, but the two movies are unrelated in terms of narrative other than both being films featuring killer sharks. Plot When a great white shark eats the potential catch of a sport fisherman, the man and his daughter violently retaliate by sadistically torturing and killing the shark, whose corpse then sinks to the bottom of an underwater cave and is subsequently resurrected as a ghost shark due to the cave's mysterious paranormal properties. Now hungry for revenge, the ghost shark eats his redneck killers along with the captain of their boat, eventually setting its sights on the rest of the local community in the seaside town of Smallport, Florida. Due to the great white's new spectral form, it can attack and kill anyone as long as there is even the smallest amount of water nearby, including coming out of a swimming pool, a bathtub, a bucket, a metal pipe, and even a drinking cup, killing many people in several locations. Though the terror is seemingly out of control, a group of young people trying to find answers end up having their pleas ignored. With the local mayor in the midst of his re-election campaign and other authorities unwilling to believe in such a state of events, teenager Ava Conte (Mackenzie Rosman), who vows to put an end to the specter after it devours her father and several friends, teams up with a local lighthouse keeper named Finch (Richard Moll), a drunken figure who claims to know the secrets to the shark's new- found form. After being arrested, harassed, threatened, and otherwise impeded in their struggles, the group then finally manages to lay the creature to rest once and for all. Cast * Mackenzie Rosman as Ava Reid * Dave Randolph- Mayhem Davis as Blaise Parker * Sloane Coe as Cicely Reid * Jaren Mitchell as Cameron Stahl * Richard Moll as Finch * Lucky Johnson as Mayor Frank Stahl * Tim Taylor as Deputy Hendricks * Shawn C. Phillips as Mick * Thomas Francis Murphy as Chief Martin Reception Critical reception for Ghost Shark has been predominantly negative. The film holds a rating of 29% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on seven reviews. For example, critic Jim Vorel wrote for Paste blasting the film as \\"a mind-numbing movie\\" featuring severe problems \\"[f]rom its performances to its horrendous execution in the editing room\\". He concluded, \\"the film violates the most crucial rule of trashy filmmaking‚Äî you can be stupid, but don‚Äôt be boring.\\" Vorel particularly criticized the fact that the character of Cicily, played by Sloane Coe, is filmed in a sexually suggestive manner in several scenes despite the fact that she's identified as being too young to have a driver‚Äôs license (and is presumably under the age of consent). One of the rare mixed to positive reviews for Ghost Shark came from Horrornews.net, with the film given a five out of ten score and labeled as featuring both \\"[s]pecial effects that would make a film student cringe\\" but also a \\"well experienced cast mixed with fresh faced and eager newcomers.\\" The film was compared, both positively and negatively, to an episode of one of the Scooby-Doo cartoons. Also, in spite of being panned critically, the movie had some success attracting social media attention, with websites such as Vulture.com commenting on moments from the film.

Its motto is United to assist. History The creation in 1833 of the United Ancient Order of Druids was the result of a split in the Ancient Order of Druids, a significant part of the members decided to create a druidic order more open to different social classes, structured as a benefit society and registered by governmentRonald Hutton, Blood and Mistletoe: The History of the Druids in Britain, New Haven, Yale University Press, 2009.. During the first decades, the UAOD kept the same emblem as the AOD (a shield with three oaks surrounded by a Celtic warrior and a druid), changing the motto to united to assist. Very soon, the UAOD proved to be a great success and many of its members travelling abroad created new lodges in United States of America (1839), Australia (1851), New Zealand, German empire (1872)... In 1858, the UAOD separated itself in two parts, and a new fraternal society, the Order of Druids was createdVictoria Solt Dennis, Friendly and Fraternal Societies: their badges and regalia, London, 2008, p. 107..

The town is known for its natural habitat, including serene hills, caves, large rocks and stones, rivers, forests, wild animals, and fertile lands. Ugbo is the ancestral home to many towns in Igboland. Ogulugu (which later split into Ugbo and the neighboring Obeagu community) is the oldest son of Ewa, the original progenitor of nearby communities, including Amoli, Agbudu, Isu-Awaa (Ewa), Ituku, and Ogbaku. The Ewa (Awaa) kindred, together with Ntuegbe, make up what is known as Mbanabor clan in Awgu LGA of Enugu State. Based on 2006 census, the population of Ugbo is projected to be about 32,000. Ugbo comprises three large villages, namely, Ugbo-Okpala, Ugbonabor, and Ngene Ugbo.  Location  Ugbo is located in a hill-top, northwest part of Awgu Local Government Area, Enugu State. The town occupies a vast area of land bounded by other communities, such as Obeagu to the southwest, Achi to the west, Amoli to the northwest, Owelli to the north, Ogugu to the east, and Mmaku to the south.  Traditional government  Ugbo features traditional rulers and chiefs.  Religion  There are two main types of religion in Ugbo, namely, Native Religion and Christianity. Native Religion: Many deities and oracles exist in the town but most notable is the Anu Ogulugu. The Anu Ogulugu is the supreme deity and sits at a hilltop, Umu- Ewa, the ancestral home of the different Ewa communities, from where he is worshiped and oversees the welfare of Ugbo and the entire Ewa people. Christianity: After a stern resistance and a fierce battle that lasted for years, the White Christian Missionaries finally gained entrance to Ugbo in the year 1917. Since then, Christianity has grown in the town with many denominations but most common has been the Anglicans and the Catholics. Notable churches are the Emmanuel Anglican Church, Ugbo-Okpala (1918); St. Anthony's Catholic Church Ugbonabor (1933); St. Bridget's Catholic Church, Ngene Ugbo (1935; and the Christ Apostolic Church, Ugbo-Okpala.  Festivals  Ugbo celebrates Native as well as Christian festivals. Prominent native feasts include Iriji ohu (new yam festival) which is observed yearly; the famous Aju (Iwa ekwa-age grade celebration) which comes every three years in the month of August; and Olili Anu Ogulugu, which is also commemorated at three-year intervals. It is worthy of note that the Olili Anu Ogulugu has lost steam in recent years due to the growing popularity of Christian religion in the town. The common Christian celebrations are the Christmas and Easter, marked every year for the birth of Jesus Christ and his ascension to heaven, respectively.  Education  The town has two secondary schools: Community Secondary School Ugbo-Okpala, and Community Secondary School, Ugbo, in addition to Police Secondary School, Ugbo currently under construction by the Federal Government of Nigeria. It also has a Computer centre, three primary schools in the three main villages, and other private schools.  Healthcare  The entire Ugbo community is served by the Community Health Centers at Ugbonabor and Ngene Ugbo constructed by community age grades.  Water  Primary source of water is the famous Oji-River, which originates at Ishi Oji in Agu Ewa in Ugbo. The river traverses through the entire town before flowing to the neighboring communities. Ugbo also enjoys modern developments in water resources through the construction of Ugbo Dam and borehole water projects.  Road  Ugbo boasts of two major roads: the 5 km Ugbo-Achi and 4 km Ugbo-Mmaku roads. The town also boasts of a network of inter and intra-village asphalt roads.  Economics  Ugbo has a diversified economic base. The town is blessed with highly qualified manpower as evidenced by individual successes in the fields of agriculture, education, politics, trade and industry. Ugbo is also endowed with abundant but untapped natural resources, including stones, clay, iron, fertile land, and traces of coal and gas deposits. The agricultural mainstay of the town is cocoyam and cassava cultivation. The Ugbo cocoyam (Ede ndi Ugbo) is the choice of buyers who travel from all parts of Southern Nigeria to the central market, Nkwo Ugbo, where sellers from the three main villages converge after four market days.  Culture  Ugbo has diverse native cultures which have eroded in recent times due to the influence of Christianity in the community. See Religion. Yet, the town still boasts of cultural masquerade and dance groups, most notably, Ogba Agu Cultural Dance, Ugbo-Okpala; Okobolo, Ugbonabor; and women dance groups, among others, which typically feature during traditional ceremonies.

Not much is known about his personal details, but he is known to have studied with Utagawa Kunisada in Edo.Doesburg 2012 He was not a professional artist, but instead a moneyed landownerRoberts 1990, 96 who used his wealth to support other Osaka print-makers directly and by opening a school of print design.Doesburg 2012 Sadamasu is more commonly referred to as , the name he officially adopted in 1848. = Publisher = Both panels bear publisher's marks associated with Tenki. The seal is a stylized version of the character Â§© (ten) contained within a circle. This appears directly above the full characters for .Newland 2005, 561 Operating under the firm name , Tenki, or as it was also known, was an active publishing house from 1816 into the 1850s.Keyes and Mizushima 1973, 311 Ukiyo-e scholar Andreas Marks notes that the seal version appearing in View of Temp≈çzan Park in Naniwa was used by Tenki on prints from 1826 to 1838.Vegder = Medium = As Sadamasu was born and for the most part based in Osaka, his works belong to the genre known as . This term was used to distinguish prints produced in Kyoto and Osaka‚Äî a region then known as Kamigata‚Äî from those originating in Edo.JAANUS, \\"Kamigata-e\\" Having come to prominence approximately a century after the emergence of ukiyo-e in Edo,Kitagawa 2005, 229 the kamigata-e genre was predominantly devoted to kabuki-e, images of kabuki actors on and off stage. Another differentiating characteristic of kamigata-e is the fact that they were produced in the main not by professional studio artists, but by amateur ‚Äútalented kabuki fans‚Äù seeking to memorialize and promote their dramatic heroes.Kitagawa 2005, 230 = Genre = The red rectangular cartouche occupying the upper right corner of the first panel reads: Naniwa/ Temp≈çzan f≈´kei. This title clearly identifies the tetraptych series as belonging to the landscape genre of ukiyo-e prints, known as f≈´keiga. In the early years of ukiyo-e, landscapes were not a popular subject, being a ‚Äúfar less dominant‚Äù genre than images of actors, beauties or everyday life scenes.Yonemura 2002, 286 In early prints, landscape was ‚Äúa prop‚ÄùCalza 2005, 196 or backdrop to the human content of the picture.Newland 2005, 433 As art historian Tadashi Kobayashi notes, ‚ÄúLandscape ukiyo-e prints by their very nature usually reflect the artist‚Äôs conception of natural settings as a stage upon which human scenes are enacted.‚ÄùKobayashi 1992, 44 This is evident in these two prints by Sadamasu, where the landscape provides the impetus and scene for the human action dominating the image. By the end of the first half of the nineteenth century, landscapes had ‚Äúeclipsed‚Äù bijinga, shunga and kabuki-e as the major strain of ukiyo-e.Newland 2005, 433 Partly as a result of the increasing influence of western art,Newland 2005, 433 landscape became a pictorial theme in and of itself, such that Hiroshige had established himself by the mid-1830s as a producer of landscape prints.Yonemura 2002, 290 = Format = The prints are vertical tate-e sheet-prints, and comprise the first and second panels of a tetraptych. As Japanese prints of the Edo period were read from right to left, they represent the two right-hand panels of the four- panel set. They are numbered with the kanji characters ‰∏Ä (1) and Ë≤≥ (2) in black ink within yellow squares at the top of the left-side column of the rectangular seal and signature cartouches. = Size = Each of the two sheets is cut to the size, which typically measures approximately 39 cm by 27 cm. This was the most prevalent format for colour ukiyo-e prints after 1780, particularly among Edo print-makers.JAANUS \\"ooban\\" This size was supplanted in kamigata-e by the smaller format‚Äîapproximately 18 cm by 25 cm‚Äîfrom 1847 on,Kitagawa 2005, 231 due in large part to Sadamasu's promotion of the smaller size among local artists.Doesburg 2012 = Subject = The prints depict a scene of crowds visiting Temp≈çzan Park in Naniwa, the former name for present- day Osaka. Temp≈çzan‚Äîliterally Temp≈ç (era) mountain‚Äîwas an approximately 20-meter high man-made hill created in 1831 (year 2 of the Temp≈ç era) through the dredging of the adjacent Ajigawa River.Kawamoto 2008 It was intended to improve ship access to the port and help prevent flooding. The mound also served as a marker for ships, earning it the nickname \\"Landmark Mountain\\" among local sailors.The British Museum After pine and cherry trees were planted on its slopes, Temp≈çzan drew increasing numbers of visitors, particularly in spring when it was customary to participate in cherry blossom viewing.City of Osaka As it developed into a popular leisure spot, tea houses and cafes sprang up to service the crowds.This information is detailed on a sign placed next to the mural in Temp≈çzan Park. View the sign at http://nohzoh.up.n.seesaa.net/nohzoh/komainu/tpzn173442.jpg?d=a0 Sadamasu's print offers a panoramic view of Temp≈çzan crowded with visitors partaking in o-hanami. The mountain is encircled by a stone wall and bounded on the other side by the bay and port. The scene is lively, packed with figures whom Sadamasu depicts in considerable detail. Those depicted fall into various social ranks and classes including courtesans and geisha, samurai, servants, hawkers and ch≈çnin townspeople.

Early life Lyman Brooks was born on May 27, 1910, to John Robert Brooks, a former slave and Union Navy veteran, who made a living as a farmer, waterman, and private music teacher, and Mary Anna Burrell, a school teacher and graduate of Hartshorne Memorial College, now Virginia Union University. Education Lyman Brooks went on to receive his undergraduate degree from Virginia Union University, and after serving many years as a teacher and principal, earned his master's degree and doctoral degree from the University of Michigan. Profession In 1938, Lyman Beecher Brooks became Director of the Norfolk Unit of Virginia Union University (now Norfolk State University). During his thirty-seven year career as the director, provost and president of the College from 1938-1975, he helped built the school from a three-classroom junior college with five teachers to an eighteen building campus with a faculty and staff of 375 and 6,300 students. Dr. Brooks leadership helped the college achieve numerous milestones. Under Dr. Brook's leadership a faculty committee and student government developed regulations for university fraternities and sororities. In 1942, the college became Norfolk Polytechnic College. Two years later in 1944, the school was renamed by the Virginia General Assembly's vote to make the school's name the Norfolk Division of Virginia State College, mandating it to become a part of Virginia State College. In 1952, the college's athletic teams adopted the \\"Spartans\\" name and identity. In September 1955, the school was relocated to a 55-acre campus on Corprew Avenue, formerly the Memorial Park Golf Course. The first degree which was a Bachelor's degree was presented by the institution in 1958. The college was separated from Virginia State College in 1969; therefore, Norfolk State College became an independent, four-year degree-granting institution with its own Board of Visitors and its own President. Personal life Lyman Brooks served as a devoted trustee and Sunday school teacher at Bank Street Memorial Baptist Church in Norfolk and was a faithful member of the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity. Legacy In 1972 a new library was completed and named the Lyman Beecher Brooks Library in honor of his many accomplishments. In 2012 the new Lyman Beecher Brooks Library, a LEED silver certified building was completed and rededicated in his honor.

Albright and released by Troma Entertainment. It stars Edward Terry in the titular role, with Stacy Haiduk and Joan Roth playing supporting roles. Plot A young Luther Watts has a fascination with carnival geeks. When he loses his teeth while at a geek show and has them replaced with a pair of sharp metallic dentures, he acquires a liking for human blood. He begins murdering people by biting their heads off, but is captured and placed in prison. After being in prison for over twenty years, Luther is paroled and released. He begins roaming around his hometown, killing people by eating off their heads. Luther invades a farm, where he holds a mother and her daughter captive. Eventually, he is shot dead by the mother while inside the farm's chicken coop. Cast * Edward Terry as The Freak * Joan Roth as Hilary * Stacy Haiduk as Beth * Thomas Mills as Rob * Jerry Clarke as Trooper * Tom Brittingham as Geek * Carlton Williams as Little Luther Production Luther the Geek was filmed in Tampico, Illinois and Sterling, Illinois. Edward Terry, who portrayed Luther, only stood five feet tall and weighed 160 pounds, so cameras were strategically placed to give the illusion that Luther was larger than Terry was. In addition, the elderly woman that Luther murders outside of the grocery store was, in actuality, a young woman in a wig and makeup. However, Luther the Geeks makeup artist requested to not be credited on the film. Release =Home media= Luther the Geek was released on DVD by Troma Entertainment, as a special Director's Cut on February 22, 2005. It was later released on DVD and Blu-ray by Vinegar Syndrome on January 19, 2016. Critical reception Luther the Geek received mostly negative reviews from critics. Richard Sopko of HorrorNews.net stated that the film was \\"aimed at only those looking to view the complete Troma repertoire\\", calling it \\"a strange mix of sadism and comedy with a low budget and little talent\\". VideoHound's Cult Flicks & Trash Pics called the film \\"[a] pointless, sadistic, stupid horror sleaze\\". Dennis Schwartz of Ozus' World Movie Reviews rated the film a grade C, calling it \\"a thoroughly awful film that just might have an appeal to those who find the freak (Edward Terry) intriguing and don't care about the sloppy plot, terrible acting, or of how dumb it is even for the usual exploitation film.\\". The film was not without its supporters. In his book Slimetime: A Guide to Sleazy, Mindless Movies, Steven Puchalski praised Luther the Geek, saying: \\"Good title. Good film. And it managed to avoid being your basic slasherama with its wonderful title character.\\" It was later included in Adam Lukeman's 101 Best Horror Movies You've Never Seen.

(Begrijpt U Nu Waarom Ik Huil?). The documentary is about the impact of post-traumatic stress syndrome on the family of a Nazi concentration camp survivor named Joop. Joop cannot forget his experiences in a concentration camp during World War II and these emotions are transferred to his wife Dina and their three children. The eldest son and daughter have long since lost contact with their parents and respond in the documentary only by letter. The youngest son Reinier, together with his wife Hadelinde, stayed in contact with his parents. Joop died in 2000, yet the camp experiences are seemingly 'inherited,' as Joop's descendants continue to pay the emotional price of his survival.

Owen motor retailing group. John Donald \\"Jack\\" Barclay, 1900-1968 Jack Barclay's name is indelibly associated with Bentley, whose powerful grand tourers dominated endurance racing at Brooklands and Le Mans throughout the 1920s. Barclay recorded a number of impressive victories at Brooklands, and logged eight world records in the International 3 Litre class in 1925. His racing prowess brought him to the attention of Woolf Barnato, the millionaire playboy who would go on to be both the chairman of Bentley and one of its works team's most successful racers. Unlike the moneyed Bentley Boys, Jack Barclay had no inherited wealth to finance his racing lifestyle. In 1922 he became a partner in motor retailer Barclay and Wyse, selling Rolls-Royce and Vauxhall cars. After he ran up massive gambling debts at the casino in Le Touquet his mother, fearful for her son's safety, paid the debts on condition that he gave up racing and focused on his motor dealership business. Accordingly, in 1927 he opened Jack Barclay in George Street, Hanover Square as a Rolls-Royce and Bentley dealership, which soon became the pre-eminent Bentley dealership worldwide. But he couldn't resist another tilt at motorsport, winning the inaugural Brooklands 500 in 1929 at the wheel of a 4 ¬Ω Litre with works driver Frank Clement, setting an average speed of 107.32 mph. With his charismatic manner and wide contacts throughout the world of motorsport and luxury cars, Jack Barclay was an outstanding salesman. He coined the phrase ‚Äòservice after sale‚Äô to describe his business ethos and much of his commercial success was based upon maintaining close and friendly relationships with his customers, a philosophy still practiced today in the company. Company history Jack Barclay Bentley, Berkeley Square The company was founded by its eponymous chairman in 1927 as Jack Barclay Ltd with two London showrooms (the chief one being in George Street) and a service centre. The company acquired the coach building firm James Young in 1937. Although motor retailing was suspended in the UK during World War II, Barclay bought coachbuilders Gurney Nutting in 1945 with the aim of restoring to roadworthy condition the Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars that had been stored during the hostilities, thus generating much-needed stock of used vehicles for the business. In 1953 the company moved into showrooms in Mayfair's Berkeley Square, where it remains as of 2019. In 1958, Jack Barclay's son Victor joined the company at the age of 20. In 1961 Lord Kindersley, then Chairman of Rolls- Royce and Bentley Motor Cars officially opened the Jack Barclay service centre at 100 York Road, Battersea. Following Jack Barclay's retirement in 1967, the business was sold to the Dutton-Forshaw group. In 1977 the group was acquired by Lonhro, then headed by chief executive Tiny Rowland. In 1979 Victor Barclay became the managing director of Jack Barclay Ltd. He was Executive Chairman at the time of his death in 1993. As the world's largest dealer in Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars the company forged strong links with the factory at Crewe. In 1993 the company was appointed the world's sole authorised distributor of parts for pre-1955 Rolls-Royce and Bentley Cars, and in the same year Peter Ward, then Chairman of Rolls-Royce and Bentley Motor Cars, officially opened 2-4 Ponton Road, Nine Elms, the largest Rolls-Royce and Bentley service and repair operation in the world. The company also commissioned a number of limited edition ‚ÄòJack Barclay specials‚Äô during the 1990s, including ten Jack Barclay Platinum Bentley Azures in 1997 to mark the company's 70th anniversary. In 1998 Rolls-Royce and Bentley parted ownership after which Jack Barclay Ltd became a solus Bentley dealership. Jack Barclay Service Center In September 2000 Jack Barclay was acquired by the H.R. Owen group, the world's largest retailer in Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Lamborghini and Bugatti brands. In 2011 the Jack Barclay Service Centre was relocated to Burr Road in Wandsworth with a dedicated 16,000 square foot combined service and bodyshop facility providing the largest and most technically advanced Bentley Aftersales business in the world.

Kemper rose to prominence in the tennis scene, eventually heading the women's tennis team at Georgetown University, where she earned the nickname \\"Coach\\". Kemper has spent more than 30 years coaching movie stars, professional athletes, monarchs, Supreme Court Justices, Ambassadors, members of Congress, intelligence agency directors, and individuals from seven White House administrations. In 1992, Kemper founded the Institute For Education (IFE), a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C. that recognizes and promotes leadership, civility, and the search for common ground locally, nationally, and in the world community. The Institute has come to host many famous guests, including Hillary Rodham Clinton, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Arianna Huffington. Kemper is also an op-ed writer and columnist, and has a regular Huffington Post blog. Her work has been featured in The Globalist, The Hill, USA Today, Roll Call, The Washington Examiner, Newsday, Bangkok Post and The Washington Diplomat. Background Kathy Kemper was born in Northfield, Illinois to Joan Sealy and James Kemper. She attended Marillac High School, where she captained the basketball team and graduated in 1971. Soon after, Kemper enrolled in Marymount College near Boca Raton, Florida on a tennis scholarship. During her time there, she was denied entry into a collegiate tennis tournament due to her athletic scholarship. Kemper's coach, Peachy Kellmeyer, among others, challenged the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women on their anti-scholarship policy. The resulting court case helped bring about essential reform in women's athletics in the form of Title IX legislation. Kemper was the head women's tennis coach at Georgetown University from 1978 to 1990, coaching Georgetown's No.1 player to a four-year undefeated match play streak and to the Big East and NCAA National Women's Division II title in 1983. During her time as Georgetown's head women's tennis coach, Kemper helped launch Women at the Net: a celebrity benefit tournament where participants would play against Georgetown's current team. In 1986 alone, the New York Times reported that seven U.S. senators, the Secretary of the Treasury, four Ambassadors, and the Republican National Chairman would be in attendance. After Georgetown, Kemper began to focus on private tennis lessons, entrepreneurship, and the development of her nonprofit, the Institute for Education. Kemper is currently an AI Ambassador for AIGrrls, a trustee emeritus for Learn Serve International, and an investor focusing on biotech and healthcare with Family Futures LLC. Institute For Education Kathy Kemper founded the nonprofit Institute for Education (IFE) in 1992 when her husband, James Valentine, suggested she organize a breakfast to introduce her political contacts with his business colleagues. In her position as CEO, Kemper helped IFE establish its reputation for diplomacy after facilitating what was the first-ever regional summit between the Governors of Maryland, Virginia and the Mayor of DC (Bob Ehrlich, Mark Warner, and Anthony A. Williams respectively.) The Institute regularly holds \\"INFO Roundtables,\\" which have been hosted by over 280 speakers, including a Vice President, various Supreme Court justices, governors, Cabinet secretaries, CIA and FBI directors, Nobel laureates, and professional athletes. Since 2012, the Institute for Education has shown a greater focus on the power of data, innovation, and soft diplomacy, often praising collaboration between the federal government and private sector, such as the Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) program. The founders of the PIF program are former U.S. Chief Technology Officer Todd Park and former White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Senior Advisor for Innovation, John Paul Farmer, both of whom are part of IFE leadership. In 2015, IFE partnered with USC's Viterbi School of Engineering to offer a free coding summer camp for underrepresented populations in grades K-12 around the Los Angeles area. In 2016, the Institute for Education celebrated its 25th season anniversary. In 2019, Kemper was recognized by Washington Life as one of their \\"Tech 25\\", an annual award spotlighting DC's 25 top technological innovators. Personal life Kemper married James Healy in the mid-seventies after the two met at Princeton University. Later, they moved to Washington, DC and eventually separated. In 1990, Kathy Kemper married James Valentine, gaining a son, Travis E. Valentine. The couple had their first daughter, Kelsey Kemper Valentine, in 1991. Their second daughter, Christina Kemper Valentine, was born in 1993.

The highway runs from its southern terminus at its junction with SR 189 and SR 190 in Fort Jennings to its northern terminus at the intersection of SR 15 nearly north of Continental. SR 634 runs entirely within Putnam County and is entirely a two-lane highway. SR 634 was commissioned in the late 1930s, the northern terminus was in Defiance County. Some of the highway was paved when it was commissioned. The last section to be paved was in the early 1950s. The northern terminus was moved to its current location in the late 1960s. Route description SR 634 begins at an T-intersection in Fort Jennings, SR 189 enters from the northwest and SR 190 enters from the southwest. SR 190 and SR 634 leave the T-intersection concurrent, heading northeast. The road passes through residential properties, as a two-lane highway. Before leaving Fort Jennings, SR 634 leaves SR 190, heading due north. SR 634 heads north, leaving Fort Jennings and entering rural Putnam County. In rural Putnam County the road passes through farmland, as a two-lane highway. The road has an intersection with U.S. Route 224 (US 224), in rural Jackson Township. Here, SR 634 has its lowest traffic counts; within the 2011 ODOT survey, the road is listed with an average annual daily traffic (AADT) of 450 vehicles on a section of highway that is between US 224 and SR 114. At Township Road M (T‚ÄìM), SR 634 makes a sharp turn, heading due west. That turn is followed by another sharp turn due north. The highway has a T-intersection with SR 114 in Cloverdale. SR 634 heads due east, concurrent with SR 114, before SR 634 turns northwest bound and SR 114 continues southeasterly. The road heads northwest, leaving Cloverdale and begins to parallel the Auglaize River. SR 634 parallels the river, until the highway crosses the river just south of Dupont. The road enters the village of Dupont, after the bridge over the Auglaize River ends. SR 634 passes through mostly residential properties in Dupont. The route leaves Dupont, heading north passing through farmland. SR 634 turns east concurrent with SR 613\\\\. The two routes head concurrently into Continental, passing through commercial and residential properties. SR 634 turns due north leaving SR 613\\\\. The highway heads through downtown Continental, passing through commercial properties. In downtown the route crosses two Norfolk Southern Railroad tracks. The road crosses over a railroad branch line. Here, SR 634 has its highest traffic counts with 2,690 vehicles on a section of highway that is in downtown Continental. The highway passes through residential properties, before leaving Continental. North of Continental, the route passes through farmland, before coming to its northern terminus at an intersection with SR 15\\\\. Continuing north after SR 634 ends is County Road 21. There are no segments of SR 634 that are included as a part of the National Highway System (NHS). History The SR 634 designation was applied in 1937 commissioned from Fort Jennings to SR 18 east of Defiance. The highways was paved between Fort Jennings and Cloverdale, then again from Continental to the Defiance County line. In 1951 the last section of the route was paved, that was a section of road in Defiance County, just south of the then northern terminus. Between 1967 and 1969, the section of SR 634 north of SR 15 was decommissioned.

It started in relation to early-stage startups who need massive growth in a short time on small budgets, but has since then also reached bigger corporate companies. The goal of growth hacking strategies is generally to acquire as many users or customers as possible while spending as little as possible. A growth hacking team is made up of marketers, developers, engineers and product managers that specifically focus on building and engaging the user base of a business. The typical growth hacker often focuses on finding smarter, low-cost alternatives to traditional marketing, e.g. using social media, viral marketing or targeted advertising instead of buying advertising through more traditional media such as radio, newspaper, and television. Growth hacking is particularly prevalent with startups, when the goal is finding product/market- fit or achieving rapid growth in the early-stages of launching a new product or service to market. Growth hacking may focus on lowering cost per customer acquisition, or it may focus on long-term sustainability. \\"The goal of any marketing should be long-term sustainable growth, not just a short-term gain. Growth hacking is about optimization as well as lead generation. Imagine your business is a bucket and your leads are water. You do not want to pour water into a leaky bucket; it is a waste of money. That is why a true growth hacker would care about customer retention.\\" Those who specialize in growth hacking use various types of marketing and product iterations to rapidly test persuasive copy, email marketing, SEO and viral strategies, among other tools and techniques, with a goal of increasing conversion rates and achieving rapid growth of the user base. Some consider growth hackinghttps://neilpatel.com/what-is-growth-hacking/ a part of the online marketing ecosystem, as in many cases growth hackers are using techniques such as search engine optimization, website analytics, content marketing and A/B testing. On the other hand, not all marketers have all the data and technical skills required by a growth hacker, therefore a separate name for this field is applicable. Product development is also heavily influenced by the growth hacker mindset. Instead of long development cycles followed by user testing. Growth hackers start user testing with wireframes and sketches; validating ideas at every stage. A growth hacker in a product development role would start user testing in a coffee shop instead of a corporate usability lab. History Sean Ellis coined the term \\"growth hacker\\" in 2010. In the blog post, he defined a growth hacker as \\"a person whose true north is growth. Everything they do is scrutinized by its potential impact on scalable growth.\\" Andrew Chen introduced the term to a wider audience in a blog post titled, \\"Growth Hacker is the new VP Marketing\\" in which he defined the term and used the short term vacation rental platform Airbnb's integration of Craigslist as an example. He wrote that growth hackers \\"are a hybrid of marketer and coder, one who looks at the traditional question of 'How do I get customers for my product?' and answers with A/B tests, landing pages, viral factor, email deliverability, and Open Graph.\\" In the book \\"Growth Hacking\\", Chad Riddersen and Raymond Fong define a Growth Hacker as \\"a highly resourceful and creative marketer singularly focused on high leverage growth\\" The second annual (2013) \\"Growth Hackers Conference\\" was held in San Francisco set up by Gagan Biyani. It featured growth hackers from LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube among others. In 2015, Sean Ellis and Everette Taylor created GrowthHackers - the largest website community dedicated to growth hacking and now host the annual GrowthHackers Conference. Methods To combat this lack of money and experience, growth hackers approach marketing with a focus on innovation, scalability, and user connectivity. Growth hacking does not, however, separate product design and product effectiveness from marketing. Growth hackers build the product's potential growth, including user acquisition, on-boarding, monetization, retention, and virality, into the product itself. Fast Company used Twitter's \\"Suggested Users List\\" as example: \\"This was Twitter's real secret: It built marketing into the product rather than building infrastructure to do a lot of marketing.\\" However growth hacking isn't always free. TechCrunch shared several nearly free growth hacks explaining that growth hacking is effective marketing and not mythical marketing pixie dust. As new tools(SaaS) come out specifically that focus on more advanced forms of Growth Hacking, more and more tools are being offered as free. The heart of growth hacking is the relentless focus on growth as the only metric that truly matters. Mark Zuckerberg had this mindset while growing Facebook. While the exact methods vary from company to company and from one industry to the next, the common denominator is always growth. Companies that have successfully \\"growth hacked\\" usually have a viral loop naturally built into their onboarding process. New customers typically hear about the product or service through their network and by using the product or service, share it with their connections in turn. This loop of awareness, use, and sharing can result in exponential growth for the company. Growth hacking frames the user acquisition process through the \\"Pirate Funnel\\" metaphor (in short, new users flow through a 6-stage funnel - awareness, acquisition, activation, retention, revenue, referral), which got its name from the abbreviation of the first six letters spelling AAARRR. Rapidly optimizing this process is a core goal of growth hacking, since making each stage of the funnel more efficient will increase the number of users in the most advantageous stages of the funnel. Twitter, Facebook, Dropbox, Pinterest, YouTube, Groupon, Udemy, Instagram and Google are all companies that used and still use growth hacking techniques to build brands and improve profits. =Examples of \\"Growth Hacks\\"= The examples below are called growth hacks and are the most well-known acts of growth hacking. Often people see growth hacking as merely repeating these growth hacks, but one should know that the 'hacks' are only the result of a repeatable growth hacking process, which all growth hackers use a way of working. Below are some of the most famous growth hacking examples: * An early example of \\"growth hacking\\" was Hotmail's inclusion of \\"PS I Love You\\" with a link for others to get the free online mail service. Another example was the offer of more storage by Dropbox to users who referred their friends. * Online worldwide independent lodging company Airbnb is an example of growth hacking by coupling technology and ingenuity. Airbnb realized they could essentially hack the Craiglist.org scale and tap both into their user base as well as their website by adding automated listing generators from Airbnb with the feature called \\"Post to Craigslist\\".
