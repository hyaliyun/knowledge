Their naval roots trace back to Commodore Arthur Sinclair. Probably the most famous member was Henry Croskey Mustin, a pioneering naval aviator who was designated Navy Air Pilot No. 3 and later Naval Aviator No. 11. Two U.S. Navy destroyers have borne the name Mustin in honor of members of the family, U.S. Navy destroyer and the U.S. Navy guided-missile destroyer . Family Often referred to as \\"The Father of Naval Aviation,\\" Captain Henry C. Mustin (1874‚Äì1923), an 1896 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, was the principal architect for the concept of the catapult launch. He married Corinne DeForest Montague, great-granddaughter of Commodore Arthur Sinclair, and a first cousin and close confidante of Wallis Simpson who became involved in a controversial relationship with King Edward VIII of Great Britain who abdicated to marry her in 1936. The Mustins had three children: Lloyd M., Henry A. and Gordon S. As a Lieutenant Commander in January 1914, Mustin established Naval Aeronautic Station Pensacola, the Navy's first permanent air station together with a flight school, and became its first Commanding Officer. The first flight was made from the station on February 2 by LT J. H. Towers and ENS G. de Chevalier. On November 5, 1915, while underway, LCDR Mustin successfully flew an AB-2 flying boat off the stern of the USS North Carolina (ACR-12) in Pensacola Bay, FL, making the first ever recorded catapult launching from a ship underway. In 1899, he earned a commendation for distinguished service in the capture of Vigan, Philippines. The first operational missions of naval aircraft were flown under his command during the Veracruz operation in 1914 and he was the first to hold the title: Commander, Aircraft Squadrons, Pacific Fleet. Designated Naval Aviator Number Eleven, Captain Mustin was instrumental in the design of the Naval Aviator Insignia. His eldest son, Vice Admiral Lloyd M. Mustin, (1911‚Äì1999), a 1932 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, took part in developing the Navy's first lead-computing anti-aircraft gun sight, which proved of major importance in the air-sea actions of World War II, and served on the cruiser USS Atlanta (CL-51) during the naval battle of Guadalcanal. His ship was lost during that action; with other survivors he landed on Guadalcanal and served ashore with a naval unit attached to the 1st Marine Division. His post-war service included commands at sea and development and evaluation of weapon systems. He later served as director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Vice Admiral Mustin's two sons, retired Navy Vice Admiral Henry C. Mustin and Lieutenant Commander Thomas M. Mustin continued their family's tradition of military service. Vice Admiral Mustin, a 1955 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, was a decorated Vietnam veteran who served in the 1980s as the Naval Inspector General, Commander, Second Fleet and Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Plans and Policy. Lieutenant Commander Mustin, also a Naval Academy graduate (1962) earned a Bronze Star during the Vietnam War for river patrol combat action. Additionally, two of Vice Admiral Henry C. Mustin's sons and one daughter-in-law served in the Navy. Captain Lloyd M. Mustin II and his wife, Captain Tracy Mustin, retired in 2015. Rear Admiral John B. Mustin, a 1990 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, continues to serve in the Naval Reserves. He briefly returned to active duty service as the Commanding Officer of Inshore Boat Unit 22, deployed to Kuwait, from 2004‚Äì2005 and was selected for promotion to rear admiral (lower half) in March 2016. In May 2020, RADM John Mustin was nominated for promotion to vice admiral and assignment as Chief of Navy Reserve. VADM Hank Mustin's third son, Tom Mustin, worked as an actor before becoming a TV news reporter. He is known for his appearances in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home as a medical intern (1986), Death Dreams as the security guard (1991), Mad at the Moon as the town mayor (1992) and The Young and the Restless as the ski shop salesman (1992).https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0615996/ He was previously a news anchor on CBS4 in Denver. VADM Hank Mustin's grandson, Lieutenant Commander Lloyd ‚ÄúLink‚Äù Mustin, is currently serving in the U.S. Navy. https://blog.usni.org/posts/tag/lloyd-mustin Several facilities have borne the name Mustin in honor of the Mustin family. These include two destroyers of the United States Navy named USS Mustin, as well as Mustin Beach, the Mustin Beach Officers' Club, and Mustin Hall (the Bachelor Officers' Quarters) aboard Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida.

By completing the design and manufacturing stages at the same time, products are produced in less time while lowering cost. Although concurrent design and manufacturing requires extensive communication and coordination between disciplines, the benefits can increase the profit of a business and lead to a sustainable environment for product development. Concurrent design and manufacturing can lead to a competitive advantage over other businesses as the product maybe produced and marketed in less time.thumb  Introduction  The success behind concurrent design and manufacturing lies within completing processes at the same time while involving all disciplines. As product development has become more cost and time efficient over the years, elements of concurrent engineering have been present in product development approaches. The elements of concurrent engineering that were utilized were cross-functional teams as well as fast time-to-market and considering manufacturing processes when designing. By involving multiple disciplines in decision making and planning, concurrent engineering has made product development more cost and time efficient. The fact that concurrent engineering could result in faster time-to-market is already an important advantage in terms of a competitive edge over other producers. Concurrent engineering has provided a structure and concept for product development that can be implemented for future success.  Concurrent vs sequential engineering  Concurrent and Sequential engineering cover the same stages of design and manufacturing, however, the two approaches vary widely in terms of productivity, cost, development and efficiency. The 'Sequential Engineering vs Concurrent Design and Manufacturing' figure shows sequential engineering on the left and concurrent design and manufacturing on the right. As seen in the figure, sequential engineering begins with customer requirements and then progresses to design, implementation, verification and maintenance. The approach for sequential engineering results in large amounts of time devoted to product development. Due to large amounts of time allocated towards all stages of product development, sequential engineering is associated with high cost and is less efficient as products can not be made quickly. Concurrent engineering, on the other hand, allows for all stages of product development to occur essentially at the same time. As seen in the 'Sequential Engineering vs Concurrent Design and Manufacturing' figure, initial planning is the only requirement before the process can occur including planning design, implementation, testing and evaluation. The concurrent design and manufacturing approach allows for shortening of product development time, higher efficiency in developing and producing parts earlier and lower production costs. Concurrent and Sequential Engineering may also be compared using a relay race analogy. Sequential engineering is compared to the standard approach of running a relay race, where each runner must run a set distance and then pass the baton to the next runner and so on until the race is completed. Concurrent engineering is compared to running a relay race where two runners will run at the same time during certain points of the race. In the analogy, each runner will cover the same set distance as the sequential approach but the time to complete the race using the concurrent approach is significantly less. When thinking of the various runners in the relay race as stages in product development, the correlation between the two approaches in the relay race to the same approaches in engineering is vastly similar. Although there are more complex and numerous processes involved in product development, the concept that the analogy provides is enough to understand the benefits that come with concurrent design and manufacturing.  Business benefits  Using concurrent engineering, businesses can cut down on the time it takes to go from idea to product. The time savings come from designing with all the steps of the process in mind, eliminating any potential changes that have to be made to a design after a part has gone all the way to production before realizing that it is difficult or impossible to machine. Reducing or eliminating these extra steps means the product will be completed sooner and with less wasted material in the process. During the design and prototyping process, potential issues in the design can be corrected earlier in the product development stages to further reduce the production time frame. The benefits of concurrent design and manufacturing can be sorted in to short term and long term. = Short term benefits = * Competitive advantage with implementing part into market quickly * Large amounts of same part produced in a shorter amount of time * Allows for early correction of part * Less material wasted * Less time spent on multiple iterations of essentially the same part = Long term benefits = * More cost efficient over several parts produced and several years * Large amounts of different parts produced in a shorter total amount of time * Better communication between disciplines in company * Ability to leverage teamwork and make informed decisions  See also  * Traditional engineering * Iterative design * New product development  References  Category:Manufacturing ","title":"Concurrent design and manufacturing"},{"id":"49257202","text":"Bastard, Go and Kill () is a 1971 Italian Spaghetti Western film written and directed by Gino Mangini and starring George Eastman.

The building is situated in the central Indre By neighborhood on J√¶gerg√•rdsgade adjacent to the Aarhus Central Workshops.  History  The building was constructed as the administrative offices of the Danish National Railroad's central rail workshops in Aarhus. The workshops had been the primary repair facility for trains and trams in Jutland and Fuenen from 1880 and the workforce had grown steadily to some 750 people by 1910. The constant expansion of the national railroads and the growing rolling stock meant the workshops were constantly expanding necessitating an administrative unit to oversee the work. The office building was completed in 1911. The workforce peaked with some 1850 people in the post-war years but in the 1950s repair work was gradually centralized in Copenhagen and the workforce gradually started shrinking in the following decades. in 1990 DSB decided to close the facility and reassign the remaining 140 workers. The buildings were listed in 1995 after which they were sold off. In 2007 the two bottom floors were used for fitness and spinning.  Architecture  The building was designed by Povl Baumann from whom the building gets its name. The building has powerful proportions and contrary to other buildings in the area it stands freely, separated from other structures. It is situated on the highest point in the area, on a hill overlooking the workshops below. The building material is red brick like most other structures in the area.

His early work was in the inorganic chemistry of transition metal ions and ligand field theory. During the 1960s, Griffith and radiation biologist Tikvah Alper developed the hypothesis that some transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are caused by an infectious agent consisting solely of proteins. This idea was eventually developed by Prusiner and others into the so-called prion hypothesis. In 1951, when he was just 23, at Francis Crick's suggestion, Griffith performed quantum mechanical calculations on what later became known as complementary base pairing.

Career Born in Adelaide, Australia, de Rohan graduated from the University of Adelaide in 1960 with a degree in civil engineering. Aged 23 he jointly founded Kinnaird Hill de Rohan and Young (later Kinhill Engineers Pty Ltd) as a partner and then Director. The Company expanded to all other States of Australia and grew to become one of the Australia‚Äôs biggest engineering and planning consulting groups. In 1976, after the firm‚Äôs joint venture with Llewellyn-Davies Weeks International, de Rohan became deputy chairman and managing director of the London-based firm. He became a founding member of Australian Business in Europe, a director in 1978, and president in 1982-83. He also became a Fellow of the British Institute of Management. The loss of his daughter, Alison, and son-in-law, Francis Gaillard, in the 1987 Zeebrugge ferry disaster was a turning point in his life. He, along with other families, established the Herald Families‚Äô Association, which aimed to achieve greater justice and awareness of the need for higher standards of ferry safely. He was awarded an OBE in the 1992 Birthday Honours List for his role in founding it. In turn, this led to the founding of the charity Disaster Action in 1991. In 1998 he was appointed Agent-General for South Australia, based in the High Commission of Australia, London. At Lord's Cricket Ground, he was chairman of the estates committee for seven years, having become a Marylebone Cricket Club member in 1986. He was closely involved in a continuing program of development that transformed facilities for players, spectators and officials, completed on time and within budget, thanks largely to his supervision. At Lord's his most significant achievement was the widely praised ¬£8 million (A$20) refurbishment of the Victorian Pavilion, completed as the 2006 season opened. de Rohan also supervised renewal of the Mound Stand's distinctive tented roof. Just before he died on 5 October 2006, he was nominated by the Premier of South Australia, Hon Mike Rann MP to succeed Marjorie Jackson-Nelson as Governor of South Australia, a post he was to take up on his return to Adelaide. However, soon after learning of the honour, knowing he was suffering from cancer, his condition worsened. Hours before his death, he was made an Officer of the Order of Australia at a special presentation conducted by the Australian High Commissioner Hon Richard Alston AO witnessed by family and close friends. He was an avid supporter and member of the Port Adelaide Football Club, and in the days before his death was planning the club's international match at The Oval against archrivals the Geelong Football Club in October 2006. Since his death his home city of Adelaide has created a number of memorials, including the Maurice de Rohan International Scholarship at the University of South Australia.

He has previously played for the London Broncos in the Championship and the Super League, and spent time on loan from the Broncos at the London Skolars and the Hemel Stags in League 1. Background Walker was born in Harlow, Essex, England. Walker is a product of the London Broncos academy system and made his first team debut on 13 September 2014. He has now established himself in the starting line up of the London Broncos first team. Playing career Walker made his d√©but for the London Broncos in the Super League against the Bradford Bulls in 2014. Walker made his representative d√©but for Scotland in 2015. Walker has received widespread praise both from within the club and more recently, pundits from across the game. Playing in the fullback position, he is noted for his positional awareness and operating well under pressure. Walker played a pivotal role in the Broncos' successful 2018 season, the culmination of which was their promotion to Super League in 2019. In particular, he was instrumental in the Broncos' 4-2 win over the Toronto Wolfpack in the Million Pound Game, the winner of which would be promoted to Super League. This was despite breaking one, and dislocating three, fingers in the first minute of the match. In the 70th minute, Walker made a one-on-one try saving tackle that would later be described as the 'Million Pound Tackle' on Toronto player Blake Wallace, holding Wallace up and preventing an otherwise certain try. After this match, which has been dubbed the biggest in the club's history, Championship Coach of the Year Danny Ward said of Walker, ‚ÄòIt was an unbelievable effort from the kid,‚Äô. ‚ÄòHe was outstanding all game. It was brave but it was a Grand Final, you just have to stay out there. I couldn‚Äôt take him off, I didn‚Äôt have another full-back. He is one of a few good young London kids coming through and he‚Äôs made the full-back spot his own.'

Its headquarters is located in Rivne.  History  When Ukraine gained independence from the Soviet Union, there were three Military Districts on its territory. These were the Kyiv, Odessa and Carpathian Military Districts. In 1998, the Western Operational Command was created from the Carpathian Military District. By 1 July 2006, the Western Operational Command consisted of units directly subordinated to the command and to the 13th Army Corps. These units were: * 7th Separate Army Aviation Regiment * 11th Separate Artillery Brigade * 15th Rocket Artillery Regiment * 14th Separate Mechanized Brigade * 24th Separate Mechanized Brigade * 55th Separate Communications Regiment * 80th Airmobile Regiment * 146th Reconnaissance and Command Center * 59th Artillery Regiment * 128th Separate Mountain Infantry Brigade * 703rd Engineering Regiment * 704th Separate Chemical Defense Regiment In October 2013, Operational Command North was created in Rivne. The Western Operational Command's headquarters was moved to Lviv and disbanded in August 2015. In November 2013, the 80th Airmobile Regiment was upgraded to brigade strength. From the beginning of 2015, Operational Command North was moved to Chernihiv. Operational Command West headquarters remained in Rivne. Major General Ihor Dovhan led the command from 2015. In October 2015, the 10th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade was formed in the command. During late January and early February 2016, units of Operational Command West participated in joint training exercises with British instructors in Rivne. On 5 February, the command was assigned responsibility for Ground Forces troops in Volyn, Zakarpattia, Ivano-Frankivsk, Lviv, Rivne, Ternopil, Khmelnytskyi, and Chernivtsi Oblasts.

It is the second part of a trilogy of films (the first being 2012's The Golden Temple) documenting the impact of mega events on marginalised communities in large cities. The film was produced by the Caucaso Factory production company and directed by Enrico Masi. The film mainly follows two individuals and their experiences in the run up to the World Cup and then the Olympics, which culminate in the eviction and demolition of the Vila Aut√≥dromo social community and the dispossession of the Universidade Indigena, or Indigenous University, based in the Aldeia Maracan√£. The film is narrated in French by Marie Christine Elekes but is otherwise in Portuguese with English subtitles.  Title  The film's title is taken from a 17th- century millenarianist book of the same name written by Portuguese Jesuit Antonio Vieria (1608‚Äì1697) who dedicated his life to the evangelisation of the indigenous peoples of Brazil. His book prophesied the rise of the Brazilian Empire to be the world's fifth great civilisation, after the Assyrian, Persian, Greek and Roman empires. The film references the book and its historical context to highlight the ongoing forced assimilation of Brazil indigenous communities and the marginalisation of indigenous culture. Synopsis The film mainly follows two individuals, Inalva Mendes Brito and Urutau Guajajara, placed at the heart of the negative impacts that resulted from the policies of the Brazilian government, FIFA and the IOC in the run up to Rio de Janeiro's World Cup and Olympic Games. Inalva Mendes Brito is a teacher who lived in the Vila Aut√≥dromo, a semi-autonomous community that emerged in the 1970s as a result of a fishermen's colony on Rio de Janeiro's periphery merging with various groups of syndicalists who had been persecuted by the military dictatorship. The Vila Aut√≥dromo, which won the Urban Age Award for best conciliation project in 2013, was demolished in June 2015 to make way for the Olympic Park. In the film, Mendes Brito stresses the insignificance of financial compensation and the audience witness the emotional moment when she revisits the pile of rubble that used to be her home for the first time since her eviction. Urutau Guajajara is an indigenous Brazilian linguist and figurehead of the Universidade Indigena, which is dedicated to the protection of native culture. The film follows his struggle to hold on to his indigenous identity and his eventual eviction from the Aldeia Maracan√£, or Maracan√£ Village, home of the Indigenous University inside the former Museo do Indio (a derelict colonial palace just beside the Maracan√£ Stadium), prior to the World Cup. The film also makes use of interviews with several other Brazilians, both indigenous and European, as well as footage of the Brazilian educator and philosopher, Paulo Freire, at the University of Bologna in 1989, who explores the significance of language in identity and the role of violence in the relationship between oppressed and oppressor. Themes Hist√≥ria do Futuro stresses the concept of ‚Äòneutralisation' i.e. the Brazilian government's attempts to disempower indigenous and impoverished communities via oppression and/or assimilation. As the film's title suggests, the film makes use of colonial motifs to contextualise this process, as well as juxtaposing the promised benefits of the two mega events extolled by the Brazilian authorities (most often in the form of posters), with the reality of poverty, violence and assimilation revealed by the citizens themselves. The film also explores the role of Brazil's indigenous population in maintaining the natural environment, and the possible consequences for the Amazon if their culture were to die out.

After overcoming the Japanese defences around Shaggy Ridge, the Australian forces descended the steep slopes of the Finisterre Range and pursued the withdrawing Japanese towards Bogadjim and then Madang on the north coast of New Guinea. There they linked up with US and Australian forces that had advanced along the coast from the Huon Peninsula, while the remnants of three Japanese divisions withdrew towards Wewak, where further fighting would take place throughout late 1944 and into 1945. Background alt=Area map of New Guinea and surrounds =Geography= Situated on the north-eastern coast of Papua New Guinea on the Schering Peninsula, which juts out into the northern part of Astrolabe Bay, Madang offers a protected deep- water port open to communication through the Vitiaz Strait and the Bismarck Sea. Established as the capital of German New Guinea prior to World War I, during the German administration of the area, the town of Madang had been known as Friedrich-Wilhelmshafen. Following the war, the area had been placed under Australian administration in 1920 and had subsequently been renamed. The pre-war population of the area was estimated at around 25,000 to 30,000 indigenous inhabitants within the greater Madang area, with under 100 Asians and around 200 Europeans. The European population was largely evacuated from the town in late 1941 and early 1942. The harbour is landlocked and set in a lagoon that runs between Cape Barschtsch and the Schering Peninsula. Seawards, it is protected by Kranket Island. Bounded by the Adelbert Range to the east and Cape Barschtsch to the north, the town sits on a flat coastal strip that consists of some swampy areas, plantations and grassed areas. Further inland, the vegetation grows more dense, although at the time of the battle it was passable, particularly on foot. The terrain is less rugged than the Finisterre Range to the south and there are no especially high features, although it is more difficult north of the Gogol River, which flows into Astrolabe Bay about halfway along the coast between Bogadjim and Madang. This river, along with several others including the Gori and Palpa, form significant obstacles along the southern approaches to the town. =Strategic situation= Madang was captured by the Japanese in early March 1942, along with Lae and Salamaua as part of operations to establish a key base at Rabaul. After this, the Japanese had worked to improve various means of communication around the area including roads, port facilities and airfields to utilise Madang's deep-water harbour as part of a forward base, which was established around Madang and Alexishafen, north, to support forces in the Salamaua‚ÄìLae area. In 1943‚Äì1944, Australian and US forces began offensive actions in New Guinea, having stemmed the tide of the Japanese advance during the fighting in 1942. In September 1943, the Allies had secured Lae and Nadzab. Shortly afterwards, the 9th Division had landed on the Huon Peninsula and had subsequently secured Finschhafen and began clearing inland. By October 1943, the next objective for the Australians was Shaggy Ridge, a series of high positions on the inland route from Dumpu to Madang, which was held by Japanese infantry, supported by artillery and engineers. After the defeat of the Japanese in the Battle of Shaggy Ridge in late January 1944, the remnants of the Japanese 78th Infantry Regiment, assigned to Lieutenant General Shigeru Katagiri's 20th Division, part of Lieutenant General Hataz≈ç Adachi's 18th Army, began a withdrawal from the Finisterre Range and was tasked with reorganising itself around Madang and carrying out delaying actions. Around the same time, Hidemitsu Nakano's 51st Division, began withdrawing west along the coast from the Finschaffen area, undertaking a difficult march to bypass Saidor following the landing there by US troops. These moves were part of a general withdrawal that would see the Japanese move beyond the Sepik River towards Aitape and Wewak, with one division ultimately being sent to Hollandia. The withdrawal of Japanese troops towards Madang enabled the Australian Army forces to break through the Japanese positions in the Finisterre Mountains, which had been holding up their drive north. After a brief pause to bring up supplies, and to rotate troops as the Australian 11th Division under Major General Allan Boase replaced George Vasey's 7th Division, the Australians slowly advanced down the rugged, densely forested slopes of the Finisterres, pursuing the withdrawing Japanese towards Bogadjim on the northern coast, about away. For the advance, two infantry battalions from the Australian 15th Infantry Brigade ‚Äì the 57th/60th and 58th/59th ‚Äì were given the task of pushing forward from Kankiryo towards Madang via the Mindjim River, Astrolabe Bay and Bogadjim. The brigade's third infantry battalion, the 24th, was held back in reserve maintaining a defensive posture around Shaggy Ridge, while also pushing forward on the Australians' western flank along the Ramu River towards Kesawai and Koropa. At the same time, US troops would advance east from their base around Saidor about . In the final stages of the battle, Australian troops from the 8th Infantry Brigade would be moved up the coast by sea from Saidor. Battle In the early stages of the pursuit, the Australians sent long-range patrols forward from the Finisterres, while two battalions from the US 32nd Infantry Division landed around the Yalau Plantation as US forces advanced east from Saidor. They began patrolling operations around the coast to the east and west, fighting minor skirmishes, and pushed towards Bau Plantation and Yangalum, on the eastern side of the Australian advance with the intention of linking up. Throughout February and March, the Japanese 20th Division withdrew towards Madang, fighting a series of rearguard actions against the Australians that were advancing from Kankiryo. The going was tough for the troops of the Australian 15th Infantry Brigade who advanced slowly towards Bogadjim, using aggressive patrols to advance their position forwards. The Japanese began strengthening their defences around Bogadjim at this time, constructing a series of outposts in a radius to the south of the town; nevertheless, Australian patrols were able to bypass these and penetrate towards Erima Plantation where intelligence received from locals indicated large concentrations of Japanese forces. After taking over the western drive up the Ramu River from the 24th Infantry Battalion, the 2/2nd Commando Squadron advanced from Kesawai and then to Orgoruna, linking up with the 57th/60th Infantry Battalion around Yaula on 4 April. Advancing along a motor road that had been laid by the Japanese, the Australians moved along an axis bounded by the Nuru River and Kabenau River. The withdrawing Japanese offered stiff resistance, but continued to withdraw, allowing the Australians to link up with US forces around Rimba. Bogadjim was eventually reached on 13 April. Meanwhile, part of the 11th Division's divisional carrier company was flown into Wantoat in response to intelligence of Japanese patrols in the area. The dismounted troops fought a brief engagement with about 20 Japanese soldiers on 14 April during which four Japanese were killed and one Australian wounded. The Australians subsequently expanded their patrols towards the confluence of the Wantoat and Ikwap Rivers. Detecting a small group withdrawing to the north, they returned to Wantoat. A later patrol resulted in four Japanese being taken prisoner. alt=A troop laden landing craft moors in a damaged harbour The 57th/60th and 58th/59th Infantry Battalions continued to patrol heavily across a wide area around the Bogadjim Road, and they subsequently joined up with US troops around Sungum. The Japanese had re-orientated themselves into positions at various locations including Alibu, Rereo, Wenga, Redu and Kaliko. During this time, a number of small unit actions were undertaken as the Japanese attempted to ambush the Australians while the Australians in turn sought to infiltrate the Japanese positions. On 22 April, large amounts of Japanese supplies were found abandoned by a patrol from the 57th/60th as it became clear that the Japanese were withdrawing from the area in a hasty fashion. At this point, the Australian command determined the need for a rotation of forces. When the commander of the 15th Infantry Brigade, Brigadier Heathcote Hammer learnt that his brigade was to be relieved by Brigadier Claude Cameron's 8th Infantry Brigade, he endeavoured to push towards Madang with all haste, in an effort to secure it before the prize went to Major General Alan Ramsay's 5th Division. On 24 April, the 57th/60th Infantry Battalion was ordered to cross the treacherous Gogol River, a fast- flowing torrent of water teeming with crocodiles. The 57th/60th attempted to outflank the Gogol River, sending a patrol to link up with two US Navy patrol boats. However, they were thwarted in their attempt to reach Madang first when troops from the 8th Infantry Brigade, operating from US landing craft, came ashore around Ort, about south of Madang, effecting a link up between the 11th and 5th Divisions. With the help of the 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment, the 5th Division had earlier cleared the Rai Coast from Sio to Saidor, which had been secured in January ‚Äì February 1944 by US forces, who were attempting to cut off the Japanese forces withdrawing from the Huon Peninsula. Madang was subsequently taken on 24‚Äì25 April by troops from the 8th and 15th Infantry Brigades, with the 30th Infantry Battalion leading the way towards the airfield, advancing along the northern part of Astrolabe Bay to secure Madang, which offered the Allies the use of a deep-water harbour, while a platoon from the 57th/60th entered the town. Resistance in the town was almost non existent. Several artillery rounds were fired by the Japanese defenders at the advancing Australians, but the rounds landed well awry of their intended target. They were followed by a short burst of inaccurate machine-gun fire. A small group of Japanese stragglers scattered on sighting the Australian platoon. Shortly afterwards, the 8th Infantry Brigade's headquarters entered Madang Harbour aboard several landing craft, escorted by the destroyer Vendetta and the corvette Bundaberg. The following day was Anzac Day, which saw the Australians consolidate their position around Madang. A follow up landing was made by the 37th/52nd Infantry Battalion on Karkar Island. Meanwhile, the 35th Infantry Battalion secured a large quantity of abandoned Japanese stores at Hansa Bay, and pushed patrols towards the Sepik River. The Bundaberg also landed a party of sailors on Sek Island, firing a heavy bombardment which wiped out the small group of defending Japanese. The 30th pushed on to the deep-water port of Alexishafen the following day, suffering several casualties from improvised explosive devices that were planted along the road by the withdrawing Japanese. In addition, large quantities of Japanese supplies were also discovered. Aftermath alt=An aerial view of a harbour With the capture of Madang, the Allies finally effectively secured the Huon Peninsula, bringing both the Huon Peninsula and Markham Valley campaigns to a close. For the Australians, the advance through the Markham, Ramu and Faria Valleys proved to be a hard slog. Casualties for the 7th Division between 18 September 1943 and 8 April 1944 amounted to 204 killed and 464 wounded. Disease took an even greater toll with 13,576 personnel being evacuated. Despite these losses, the campaign was, in the words of historian Eustace Keogh, \\"an impressive performance, characterised by energy, determination and sound planning\\". Fought with limited resources, it nevertheless demonstrated the advances that the Australian Army had made tactically and operationally since the fighting around Kokoda and Buna‚ÄìGona in 1942 and early 1943. Japanese estimates of their own casualties indicate losses of 800 killed, 400 wounded and 800 dead from disease. In the aftermath of the campaign the Australian 5th Division was tasked with providing a garrison force for the north-east coast of New Guinea, patrolling the area around Madang, which would be built up as a base with the intention of being able to supply 35,000 troops for subsequent operations. Meanwhile, the bulk of the Australian first line combat troops were withdrawn to Australia for rest and re-organisation. The commitment of US troops from the 32nd Division to the fighting around Saidor ‚Äì coupled with the dispatch of the US 41st Division to the Salamaua campaign earlier in 1943 ‚Äì represented a shift in the Allied strategy of giving the Australians autonomy of operations in New Guinea and from early 1944 until the end of the war, the US Army would assume primary responsibility for offensive operations in the Pacific. The Japanese 18th Army was subsequently ordered to withdraw to Wewak in late March; as the 51st Division withdrew to the Wewak area, the 20th Division held Hansa Bay, and the 41st Division carried out rearguard operations around Madang throughout April. Severely depleted, in all, the three divisions only fielded about 20,000 troops. In late 1944, US troops carried out a landing at Aitape and began operations to isolate the Japanese garrison there as part of the Western New Guinea campaign, later clashing around the Driniumor River. They were subsequently relieved in late 1944 by Australian troops from the 6th Division, which launched the Aitape‚ÄìWewak campaign, fighting to secure the airfield and then clear the Japanese from the inland areas, patrolling through the Torricelli and Prince Alexander mountain ranges until the end of the war in August 1945. Meanwhile, troops from the 8th Infantry Brigade remained in the Madang area until the end of the war. After the war, the Australian Army issued a battle honour for \\"Madang\\" to the 30th Infantry Battalion for its advance along the northern part of Astrolabe Bay and its subsequent capture of Madang. It was the only unit to receive that honour.

As Sergey Kudryavtsev wrote, ¬´I feel both ashamed and sorry for the aged classic of the national cinema; blaming him for his artistic impotence would be the same as making fun of an old man because of his poor health... The final scene where the author (by the way, he (Ryazanov) personally plays the fair judge) bids farewell to his heroes is automatically seen as his personal epitaph that may bring tears of regret to the eyes, like when you are standing in front of a dead man's tomb¬ª.Old Hags review, 3.5/10 by Sergey Kudryavtsev at KinoPoisk, 2000 (in Russian) Mikhail Brashinskiy from the Afisha magazine concluded: ¬´Ryazanov completely lost his sensibility, together with the USSR, Emil Braginsky and his ear for music. Today he has no idea what makes us laugh or grief, who we are and why we eat our bread. At least I felt that we are living in two different countries after finishing the film.

Born in Castenaso, Bologna, Vacchi abandoned his studies in law to pursue his passion for painting. A self-taught artist, in 1951 he held his first solo exhibition in Milan at the prestigious Galleria del Milione. After a period close to post-cubism, between 1956 and 1962 he embraced the informalism. In the early 1960s, Vacchi moved to Rome, and there he started a cycle of gouaches and paintings collectively known as Il Concilio (i.e. \\"The Council\\"), which raised large controversities with the Roman Catholic Church because of their grotesque and sometimes blasphemous representation of the church. When in 1964 Vacchi was invited to the Venice Biennale, the patriarch of Venice forbade Catholics to visit his room. Following some cues present in Il Concilio, Vacchi embraced a new art movement, known as Nuova Figurazione (\\"New Figuration\\"), of which the first significant example was Morte di Federico II di Hohenstaufen. In the following years the painting cycles Galileo Galilei semper... and Pianeta followed. In the 1990s Vacchi devoted himself to cycles of portraits and self-portraits, and particularly to Greta Garbo's portraits. In 1997 he moved to Siena, where he founded the foundation Fondazione Vacchi. He stopped painting in the late 2000s, because of the Parkinson's disease that had affected him.

The house was built in 1629 and was listed on the national Danish registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency on 1 April 1984. The building is one of the oldest in the city and it is situated in the historical Latin Quarter on Mejlgade. It has been a paint shop since 1842 and it is the oldest paint shop in the country.  History  The building was previously two houses from the years around 1600 that were joined together around 1629. It is situated on Mejlgade, a street close to the harbor and at the time home to the wealthiest merchants in the city. It functioned as a store and home for the first 200 years of its existence but not many specifics are known. In 1830 the Jewish merchant Abraham Lewis bought the house and opened a store but in 1837 he went bankrupt. Lewis could not pay his debts and wound up in debtors prison and disappeared from public records. In 1842 I.C. Juul bought the house and opened a new store selling, among other things, paint. The first years Juul sold a variety of items; herring from Trondheim, cigars, lemons, leather and aged cognac. Eventually the focus shifted to paint which was imported and then mixed in the store. In 1892 Juul had his 50th anniversary which was celebrated in Mejlgade and adjacent streets. The house has functioned as a paint shop until this day and still bears the Juul name. The long history of the house can be witnessed by entering the store. There's a paint bucket signed by most employees since 1880 and paint samples from a century.  Architecture  Juul's House in Mejlgade no. 19 is a well-preserved example of an old half-timbered Renaissance house. The house has 4 wings in a square with an internal courtyard, constructed at different periods. The storefront facing Mejlgade is two former houses joined into one around 1629. The wing along the neighboring house in no. 23 was constructed some time around 1600 but the main building is a few decades younger. In the late 1700s the back building added and in 1851 the low, narrow wing along Graven was added, creating a 4 winged estate with an internal courtyard. The front building is constructed over a foundation of tarred boulders and granite. Between the floors there's storey projections with carved beams. The slightly crooked street has made room for a short staircase of granite ashlar at the front entrance. The facade facing the street Graven was rebuilt in brick in 1864 and contains two gates. The back house to the west is half-timbered and the long side wing is half-timbered as well.

The mango is known for its bright orange colored pulp and was given the geographical indication status in 2011. History The mango was grown in 1931 by Junagadh Wazir Sale Bhai in Vanthali. About 75 grafts were then planted in the foothills of Girnar at the Junagadh Laal Dori farm. The mango is said to have been known as \\"Kesar\\" since 1934 when the Nawab of Junagadh Muhammad Mahabat Khan III said \\"This is Kesar\\" looking at the orange pulp of the fruit‚Äîkesar being Hindi for saffron. Production A mango plantation near Gir sanctuary (Sasan Gir). The Kesar mango is grown in an approximate area of 20,000 hectare in the districts of Junagadh and Amreli in the Saurashtra region of Gujarat, with an estimated annual production of two lakh tonnes. However, only the mango grown around the Gir sanctuary area is officially known as \\"Gir Kesar mango\\". This variety of mango is usually produced to the market in April, with the cultivation beginning around October after the monsoon season. Kesar variety is among the most expensive varieties of the fruit. Geographical Indication Gujarat Agro Industries Corporation (GAIC) Ltd proposed the geographical indication (GI) registration of Gir Kesar mango. After the Junagadh Agricultural University filed the application in 2010, the fruit was granted the GI tag in 2011 by the Geographical Indication Registry in Chennai, making the name \\"Gir Kesar\\" exclusive to the mangoes grown in the region. It thus became the first agricultural product from Gujarat and the second mango variety in India (after Uttar Pradesh's Dasheri mango) to earn the GI tag.

In a statement, the author described the album as a \\"cinematographic emotion of a soundtrack to a film that actually does not exist in reality.\\" It was inspired by childhood memories of the '70s films Solaris, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky in 1972, and La isla misteriosa y el capit√°n Nemo, directed by Juan Antonio Bardem and Henri Colpi in 1973. Reception Paul Simpson of AllMusic commented \\"Alva Noto's Xerrox series of albums take a break from the overwhelming glitchcore of some of his other releases (particularly ones that begin with Uni- or Trans-), instead opting to explore more ambient pastures. The series is particularly themed around copying and data manipulation, and previous volumes had a hazy, corroded edge to them. Xerrox, Vol. 3, however, focuses on dreams and childhood memories, and is much more serene than the previous volumes, coming closer to Alva Noto's work with Ryuichi Sakamoto\\".

Craig (1853 - May 27, 1929) was an educator and politician in Ontario, Canada. He represented Wellington East in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1905 to 1911 as a Conservative member. The son of James Craig and Flora McLeod, he was born in Glengarry County and was educated in Williamstown, at Upper Canada College and at Queen's University. Craig taught school in Arnprior and Orangeville. At this point, he took up the study of law for two years but then decided to return to teaching, going on to teach in Arthur, Goderich and Mount Forest. In 1881, he was named public school inspector for Wellington County. He moved to Fergus in 1882. Craig served on the village council, also serving four years as reeve. He served as chair of the Fergus Public Utilities Commission from 1913 to 1929. In 1891, he married Margaret Argo. The couple had three children. Craig also served in the county militia, reaching the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In 1916, he was given command of a battalion and tasked with preparing them for combat in World War I. This appears to have brought him into conflict with his superiors and resulted in the end of his militia career. While teaching school, Craig encouraged his students to play lacrosse and organized local lacrosse teams. When he moved to Fergus, he helped revitalize the local team. In 1898, he was named president of the Canadian Lacrosse Association. He was a member of the local Masonic lodge, reaching the rank of District Deputy Grand Master, and of the Orange Order. He also served as secretary-treasurer of the Centre Wellington Agricultural Society. Craig was first elected to the Ontario assembly in 1905 and was reelected in 1908. He was defeated by Udney Richardson when he ran for reelection in 1911. He ran again in 1923 but lost to William Raney. Following his defeat in 1923, his health began to deteriorate and Craig underwent a number of operations. He died at home in Fergus. His funeral was the largest in the history of the town.

It has been claimed that his style of writing influenced authors like Edward Hamilton Aitken (Eha). Phil was born at Chunar in India and was one of six children of Julian Robinson, an army chaplain and editor of the newspaper The Pioneer. His mother was Harriet Woodcocke, daughter of Thomas Sharpe, Vicar of Doncaster. Phil was educated at Marlborough College and after graduating in 1865, worked as a librarian at Cardiff. In 1869 he returned to India to assist his father at The Pioneer. He edited several other publications and in 1873 he joined Allahabad College as a professor of literature. Robinson was also appointed a Supreme Governor of Censor to the vernacular press in India. Retiring in 1877 he returned to England to work for The Daily Telegraph, serving as a reporter during the second Afghan campaign and the Zulu war. He was dismissed from the Sunday Times in May 1891 after he published a piece on the Prince of Wales' finances. He also worked with the Daily Chronicle and then The Pall Mall Gazette. He was a member of the Savage Club and appointed fourteen of its members into The Sunday Times after becoming its editor. Robinson married Sarah Elizabeth King in December 1876 and they had a son and a daughter. This marriage ended in a scandalous divorce that was covered extensively by the press. His wife claimed cruelty, adultery and desertion and was granted a judicial separation. In 1882 he served as a war correspondent for the Daily Chronicle in Egypt and in Sudan from 1885. He was declared bankrupt in 1889. From 1898 he served in Cuba as a correspondent for the Pall Mall Gazette and later the Associated Press during which time he suffered imprisonment.

The genus contains two species dating to the Late Aptian, Makarkinia adamsi and Makarkinia kerneri.  History and classification  When first described, Makarkinia was known from a single fossil wing which is a compression-impression fossil preserved in layers of soft sedimentary rock. Along with other well-preserved insect fossils, the Makarkinia specimens were collected from layers of the Upper Aptian Crato Formation. The formation is composed of unweathered grey and oxidized yellow limestones, which preserved numerous insects, fish, birds and reptiles as a notable lagerst√§tten. The area is a preserved inland lake or one of a series of lakes, though the nature as a fresh or salt-water body is uncertain. The depth of the basin has been suggested as either shallow or fairly deep. The basin formed near the center of the supercontinent Gondwana during the early part of the diversification of flowering plants. The M. adamsi holotype specimen was preserved in the National Museum of Brazil paleontological collection when first studied. The fossil was described by R. G. Martins-Neto in a 1992 paper on the neuropterans of the Crato Formation, with the species named in it. At the time of description the species was placed into the extinct family Panfiloviidae as Panfilovia adamsi. This placement was changed in a 1997 by Martins-Neto who moved the species to a new genus, Makarkinia and new subfamily \\"Makarkiniinae\\" in Panfiloviidae. Three years later Martins-Neto elevated the subfamily to a full family as Makarkiniidae, though this change was not widely used. It was suggested by Makarkin and Archibald in 2003 and subsequent authors that the genus was closely related to Kalligrammatidae, and moved into the family in 2016 by G√ºnter Bechly and Vladimir Makarkin. The second species described, M. kerneri, is known from the single holotype specimen residing in the Staatliches Museum f√ºr Naturkunde collections at the time of description. The fossil was first studied by G√ºnter Bechly and Vladimir Makarkin who erected the species in a Cretaceous Research paper published in 2016. They coined the specific epithet kerneri to honor Andreas Kerner, who owned the fossil until its donation to the Staatliches Museum f√ºr Naturkunde. When M. kerneri was described, Makarkinia was the only Kalligrammatidae genus known from the Americas, the other members of the family having been described from Asian and European fossils. Like other kalligrammatids, the environment of Makarkinia was subtropical to tropical in temperature, and color patterning of the fossils indicates they were daytime fliers. To lessen predation by other animals, large eye spots are found on the hindwings. The genus is the youngest member of the family to be described, living slightly after the last Eurasian genera from the early Aptian of China. Makarkinia also had the largest wing size of any living or fossil lacewing (indeed of any member of the order Neuroptera) and had an estimated maximum wing length of approximately .  Description  Makarkinia species are distinguished from other genera by the subcostal veinlets which notably curve towards the wing tip. The veinlets are forked with one to four small branches. The hindwings have a large distinct eye spot centered in the wing and surrounded by three concentric circles. =M. adamsi= The holotype wing is partially preserved and thought to be a possible forewing, though it is not whole enough to confirm. The estimated wing length is approximately . =M. kerneri= The overall size of the M. kerneri hindwing is smaller than M. adamsi, being and estimated between in full length. The costal vein starts fairly thick in the basal section of the wing and tapers down as it progresses towards the wing tip. The subcostal veinlets below the costa curve towards the wing tip and are fairly widely spaced. Between the major veins on most of the wing are many densely spaced crossveins, with the exception of between the veins at the wings tip end. The wing is covered in a coating of setae, very thick on the outer margins and major veins. On the thin veins running lengthwise along the wing and the crossveins the setae are thinner, arranged into three rows on the veins. The wing membrane has a coating of setae that thins out approaching the wing tip.

Restrictions were placed on new construction due to the presence of a pumping station near the village in a grove of pines. The soil in the area is sandy, and there are tilled fields extending from the settlement to the north and south. As the land approaches the Sava River it becomes wooded, primarily with hornbeam and oak. Name Kleƒçe was attested in historical sources as Cletschach in 1359 and 1444 (and as Cleczach in 1363 and Kletsch in 1458). It is one of several settlements that share this name, all of which lie along rivers. The name is ultimately derived from the common noun kleƒç 'gravel deposit covered with shallow soil', referring to the local geography. The feminine plural form is a result of reanalysis of a demonym derived from the common noun. History Construction of the pumping station for the Ljubljana water system began in Kleƒçe in 1888 and was completed in 1890. During the Second World War, the Italian‚ÄìGerman border ran along the main road, separating Kleƒçe from neighboring Savlje. Later, the border was shifted to fields to the north.

History  Emak was incorporated in 1992 by the merger of Oleo-Mac and Efco, two companies specialised in the production of gardening and forestry machines, both of which had been active since the 1970s in the province of Reggio Emilia (Italy). The combination of the manufacturing and managerial resources of the two companies soon allowed the new industrial complex to achieve a competitive position on the international market. In 1996 Emak secured ISO 9001 certification and from June 1998 it has been listed on the Milan Stock Exchange, forming an international group thanks to the acquisition of 9 companies. In 2008, following the acquisition of Bertolini S.p.A., Emak extended its product range to include the agricultural and gardening machines distributed under the Bertolini and Nibbi brand names. In the same year, newer models of petrol engineering replaced the old models. For example, gasoline- powered saws, such as the Efco 137S, Efco 143 and MT 442 have become more powerful and productive. Their weight was significantly reduced, for the possibility of long hard work. Also, the concern has released a new line of gasoline brushcutters, this is Efco Stark 30 TR, Efco Stark 35 IC and Efco Stark 40 TWIN. Between 2005 and 2006, the group expanded its international presence by purchasing a Polish distributor and the creation of its US subsidiary.

It was the first eyewitness painting and the first accurate view of the falls. History Thomas Davies was a British Army officer in the Royal Artillery and received training in topographic drawing at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. During the French and Indian War, he served under General Jeffery Amherst. After the attack against Montreal, he surveyed the surrounding region from 1760 to 1766 and painted six waterfalls, including this one of Niagara Falls. Niagara Falls was first described in the journals of Samuel de Champlain in 1604. The first published eyewitness description was by Louis Hennepin in Description of Louisiana (1683). His later work, A New Discovery of a Vast Country (1697), included the first image of the falls based on his description and not done on site. Davies later painted two additional views of the falls . His work was not well known until after a 1953 auction from the Earl of Derby's library. These paintings were then shown as part of a major exhibition devoted to Davies, 2 July ‚Äì 4 September 1972, at the National Gallery of Canada. On 1 April 2015, it was sold for ¬£146,500 ($217,260) at Christie's in London from the Winkworth Collection. A print of the engraving of this painting by Fougeron was sold for ¬£3,750 ($5,561). On 19 August 2015, a temporary export bar was placed on the painting in an effort to keep it in the United Kingdom. Description The view is of Horseshoe Falls from the Canadian bank. The painting shows a rainbow emerging from the mist, while two Iroquois watch on the right. The landscape has red and orange colours as the forest leaves change from green in the fall. Inscription Davies inscribed scientific notes about the falls and the landscape at the bottom of the work: Other versions J. Fougeron produced a handcoloured engraving of this work, published in Davies's Six Views of North American Waterfalls (‚Äì68). Davies later painted Niagara Falls from Above () and Niagara Falls from Below () showing the falls from different perspectives. These two are now in the collection of the New-York Historical Society.

Their third studio album Build A Tower was a UK Top 20 hit album reaching number 18.  Omerta  The Slow Readers Club evolved from earlier band Omerta. They formed in 2003 and signed to fashionable Manchester label Northern Ambition in 2005 when they released three singles, each of which sold out on the day of release and became collector's editions. Their double A-side debut Everything Is Frozen / Learn To Love The System was followed by One More Chance and their final single One More Minute. Despite strong career prospects with support from Steve Lamacq and others, the band dispersed around 2007 with no apparent prospect of further collaboration.  The Slow Readers Club  Despite the disbanding of Omerta, James Ryan and Aaron Starkie continued to jam together and eventually formed The Slow Readers Club. The band released their self- titled debut album towards the end of 2011, featuring various former Omerta songs, but also three new singles \\"Feet On Fire\\", \\"Sirens\\" and \\"Block Out The Sun\\". The band underwent a number of line up changes before settling on the current four-piece line-up of Aaron Starkie on vocals, Kurtis Starkie on guitar and backing vocals, James Ryan on bass and David Whitworth on drums, at which point their career progressed. In 2013, they released a one-off single \\"Forever In Your Debt\\", featuring a more radio-friendly sound. The B-side was \\"Days Like This Will Break Your Heart\\". Gradually, the band regained the old momentum that Omerta once had, as their live following around Manchester started to grow through a combination of word of mouth and support slots for such bands as Catfish and the Bottlemen. Various eventual tracks from their second album, Cavalcade, were introduced to the live set during this time.  Cavalcade  Prior to the release of Cavalcade in April 2015, the band released a series of singles - \\"Start Again\\", \\"Don't Mind\\" and \\"I Saw a Ghost\\" - that gained considerable airplay from such DJs as Steve Lamacq (who played and discussed the track \\"Don't Mind\\" on his BBC Radio 6 Music show Roundtable in September 2014) and Chris Hawkins on 6 Music as well as Hattie Pearson on XFM. They played XFM's First Friday club night at the Band on the Wall in Manchester and were filmed performing \\"I Saw a Ghost\\" acoustically in Manchester Central Library, months after they had become the first band to play the newly revamped library. The show was recorded for release as Live At The Library, a digital only album featuring songs from both albums to date. The band were playing bigger Manchester shows and also playing gigs further afield such as in Italy and Ireland. By the time Cavalcade was released in April 2015, a Manchester Academy show had sold out three weeks in advance. This was to herald a summer of festival headline slots at Far Out Festival, Headlander and the Manchester Food And Drink Festival as well as well-received sets at the Isle Of Wight Festival, Sheffield's Tramlines festival and a set at Ramsbottom Festival, which saw queues of festival attendees for the tent in which they were playing. The band finished the year with a sold out concert at Gorilla in Manchester as part of a successful national tour. Cavalcade took first place in Manchester blog's Even The Stars' albums of the year 2015 poll. There was another sold-out Manchester show at St Philips Church followed by a bigger national tour and dates in Montpellier and Dublin, While writing songs for their third album, they performed at a sold-out David Bowie tribute event at Sound Control in Manchester where they performed an acoustic version of \\"Life On Mars\\" to the audience of Bowie fans. Around this time that Jim Glennie of James tweeted a video of the Starkies performing an acoustic version of \\"I Saw a Ghost\\" in Manchester Central Library for video blog Matter Of Sound produced by Radio X's Hattie Pearson. Following on from this, The Slow Readers Club supported James on their Girl At The End Of The World tour in May 2016 personal invitation of Glennie and Saul Davies. The tour encompassed venues such as Bristol Colston Hall, Southend Cliffs Pavilion, London Kentish Town Forum and Brixton Academy, Llandudno Venue Cymru, Manchester Arena, Hull City Hall and Newcastle City Hall. One special night was at Bournemouth O2 Academy where the Starkies performed an acoustic set as Whitworth was absent to be at the birth of his children. The remaining band were joined on stage by Saul Davies who played violin on \\"Forever In Your Debt\\". Prior to the tour, the band made their first visit to Ireland and sold out The Workman's Club solely on the basis of word of mouth and the support of local radio station TXFM. In the wake of the success of the tour, the band played at several major festivals, filling out a tent at Kendal Calling, playing two sets at Victorious Festival in Portsmouth as well as appearing at Yorfest, Tramlines in Sheffield and Castlepolooza in Ireland and finally headlining the second stage at Ramsbottom Festival. Despite still being unsigned and maintaining day jobs, a show at Manchester's Ritz on 18 November 2016 sold out two months in advance. The show was streamed online live and featured seventeen songs from the first two albums plus two new songs \\"Lunatic\\" and \\"Through The Shadows\\" from the upcoming third album. The Manchester Evening News stated of the show \\"It would be wrong to call them Manchester's best kept secret, because any band who can sell out the Manchester's Ritz is clearly not a secret. But alongside the likes of Cabbage and Blossoms, The Slow Readers Club are currently one of the most exciting sounds coming out of our fair city.\\" Further gigs at the 500-capacity Whelan's venue in Dublin and the 600-capacity Hackney Oslo in London also sold out. The band played three further dates with James at Nottingham Royal Concert Hall, Sheffield Academy and Wolverhampton Wulfrun Hall in December.  Build a Tower  Released in May 2018, Build a Tower is the band's third album. It stayed briefly in the Top 20 of the UK Albums Chart. The band went on tour to support the album. According to the Lancashire Post, The Slow Readers Club are the band you probably have never heard of, and yet they manage to sell out venues like The Apollo and the Ritz in Manchester..

It stars Pierce Brosnan, James Frecheville, Anna Friel, Stefanie Scott, and Michael Nyqvist and was produced by David T. Friendly and Beau St. Clair, who was Brosnan's producing partner at the production company Irish DreamTime before her death. The film was released on September 23, 2016, with a limited release and on video on demand. Plot Mike Regan is a self- made aviation tycoon who lives in a state-of-the-art smart house full of modern technology with his wife Rose and 17-year-old daughter Kaitlyn. Mike's company is developing an app called \\"Omni Jet\\" which will increase business while the company raises much-needed financial capital with a stock offering. However, it requires U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval. At the company, Mike meets Ed Porter, a 28-year-old information technology (I.T.) consultant and calls him to fix his home's Wi-Fi signal, which his daughter complains is slow. Porter also upgrades the Global Positioning System (GPS) in Mike's car and claims that he also worked at the National Security Agency (NSA) and had taken part in a military exercise in Kandahar. Porter meets Kaitlyn and starts a relationship with her through social media, but Mike fires him after Kaitlyn invites Porter into the house; this ends his promising career at the company. Devastated, Porter begins to remotely access Mike's private data and his house as he covertly monitors them through the security cameras and devices all over the smart house. He also spies on Kaitlyn and secretly records her masturbating in the shower. Porter sends fake emails to Mike's clients and the SEC, threatening the company's survival. He also takes full control of the house's technology, which leaves the family terrified. He uses a spoof email to send Rose fake mammogram results, saying that she tested positive for breast cancer. Rose is extremely distressed, but her test results were actually negative according to her attending physician. After Mike becomes aware that Porter has done this, he attacks Porter and threatens to kill him if he does not stay away from his family. Porter then uploads the video of Kaitlyn masturbating online, immediately catching the attention of her schoolmates; she is mortified and blames her father for installing the technology in their house. Angered, Mike drives to see Porter but he is also being monitored by Porter, who mockingly telephones him through the car navigation system and sends him the video. Porter then remotely activates the car's brake system, hitting a nearby stalled truck and destroying the car. Mike requests help from Henrik, an I.T. expert, who says that Mike must destroy all the smart technology in the house and delete his emails, bank accounts and computer files. Henrik explains that Porter's real name is Richard Edward Portman and that his father committed suicide when he was six years old. He also reveals that he never worked for the NSA, as he claimed, and the photograph of him with soldiers in Kandahar was fake. To allow Mike to obtain evidence from Porter's apartment, Henrik creates a diversion by stealing the phone of a waitress at a coffee shop with whom Porter's obsessed and texting Porter, telling him to come to the coffee shop. While Porter is gone, Mike manages to get in his apartment and steal several thumb drives containing evidence, escaping just as Porter returns his apartment after realising it was a diversion. Porter realises the masked man that he saw in his apartment was Mike, so he frames him for assault, prompting the police to arrest Mike when trying to provide the evidence from the thumb drives to the police. After being released, Mike returns home to find Kaitlyn and Rose tied and gagged by Porter, who holds them at gunpoint. Shortly afterwards a struggle ensues; Porter shoots a window and Mike punches Porter, who hits his head and lays dying as Mike holds the gun to his chest, but Rose begs Mike not to kill him. Some time later, the company's employees applaud Mike and his family for successfully developing the app and their house is restored.

Lane entered Harvard University as a student in 1877, moving with his mother to Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and graduated in 1881. Upon his retirement in 1928, Lane was awarded an honorary A.M. by Harvard. In 1903, Lane married Bertha Palmer, and they had two daughters, Margaret Lane and Rosamond Lane. Margaret became a librarian in the public schools in Poughkeepsie, New York, and Rosamond married Milton E. Lord, a Harvard University graduate of 1919, Director of the Boston Public Library, and President of the American Library Association.Harvard University. Lane died of a heart attack at his home in Cambridge on March 18, 1931. Harvard College Library Upon graduation from Harvard University in 1881, Lane began working in the Ordering Department at the Harvard College Library, located in Gore Hall. In 1882, he was made Superintendent of the Cataloging Department, in 1884 he was named Assistant in charge of the Harvard College Library's catalog, and in 1887 he was appointed Assistant Librarian under Librarian Justin Winsor. In 1893 Lane left the Harvard College Library to serve as Librarian of the Boston Athenaeum, but he was called back to Harvard after Justin Winsor's death in 1897, and named Librarian at Harvard in 1898.Harvard College Library. As Librarian at Harvard, Lane grew the number of volumes in the Library from 200,000 to nearly 2,500,000, and refined Harvard's cataloging and classification systems. Lane also oversaw the physical transfer of the entire Library from Gore Hall to the Harry Elkins Widener Memorial Library, opened in 1915, and assisted in the planning and furnishing of the building. Lane retired in 1928 and was named Librarian Emeritus. Upon his death in 1931, Harvard President Lowell said of him, \\"[Lane] was a librarian of Harvard for 30 years, to whom scholars are grateful for the accessibility of its vast collections.\\"Harvard College Library. Professional activities In his professional life, Lane served as President of the American Library Association from 1898 to 1899. Prior to his term as President, Lane served as secretary and treasurer for fourteen years and also served as chairman of its publishing board. He was also a charter member of the Massachusetts Library Club, and served as President for the term 1891-92. He was president of the Bibliographical Society of America from 1904 to 1909. Lane was also a charter member of the Cambridge Historical Society, and a member of the New England College Librarians, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Massachusetts Historical Society, and the Dante Society, among others. Lane was also active on a number of committees at Harvard, and was especially instrumental in promoting the Memorial Society for Harvard men in World War I. He was active in the Union and the Alumni Signet Society, and was a respected scholar of Harvard history. From 1887 to 1891, he was also a lecturer at the Columbia University Library School. Librarian of Congress campaign Lane used his sphere of influence as Harvard librarian and American Library Association president when, in 1899, he spearheaded a campaign to appoint the first professional librarian, Herbert Putnam, to the position of Librarian of Congress. The position had previously been filled by politicians and journalists. In early January 1899, Librarian of Congress John Russell Young died unexpectedly, and President William McKinley sought a new candidate for the position. Massachusetts Representative Samuel J. Barrows was the leading candidate, though he had no experience as a librarian. Lane wrote to a number of congressional contacts urging the importance of appointing a librarian to the position, and in his capacity as President of ALA, collected signatures from the ALA Council (twenty members elected to an advisory board) to send to President McKinley. From a number of recommendations of suitable candidates for the job submitted by ALA members, Lane and the Council settled on Herbert Putnam, then Librarian at the Boston Public Library. Through letters to and meetings with members of Congress and the President himself, editorials in local papers, and rallying the support of librarians throughout the country, Lane pressed Putnam's somewhat reluctant candidacy. Barrows initially said he would not stand in opposition to a professional librarian backed by ALA, but matters became complicated when, in an error of manners, Barrows felt Putnam had at one point declined the nomination and made it clear he felt it dishonorable for Putnam to enter the \\"race\\" at a later stage. Putnam was embarrassed by this and formally declined President McKinley's nomination, but perhaps due to Lane's relentless campaigning and the attention brought to the issue, the Senate failed to confirm Barrows on the basis of his not being a librarian. Putnam subsequently felt able to renew his candidacy, and was appointed to the position of Librarian of Congress in March 1899. He took office that December, and held the position for forty years.Harvard College Library.

The charity aims to highlight the needs of what it considers to be the most excluded women and girls: those who have experienced extensive violence, abuse, Psychological trauma, and economic inequality, including problems such as homelessness, incarceration, addiction, serious mental health issues, engagement in prostitution, and other forms of disadvantage. The organisation has 53 members, a mix of charities working with women across the various issues Agenda seeks to address. History Agenda was brought together by a group of trusts, foundations and voluntary sector organisations building on work started with Baroness Corston‚Äôs 2007 report into women in the criminal justice system. From 2008, a group of funders collaborated through the Corston Independent Funders Commission (CIFC) to improve the response to women in contact with the criminal justice system. Primarily focused on community alternatives to custody, the CIFC became interested in broadening its scope away from women already in the criminal justice system to look at a wider group of women and girls facing disadvantage. In partnership with Clinks, CIFC carried out a consultation with organisations working with vulnerable women and girls in 2013. This consultation claimed that going into custody is just one of a range of negative outcomes for vulnerable women and girls. It found that many women and girls end up with other poor life trajectories including severe mental health problems, substance misuse issues, homelessness and involvement in prostitution. The consultation showed that there was support to develop an alliance of those with an interest in these issues: Agenda was set up as a result. A Steering Group was set up to guide Agenda's priorities, chaired by Baroness Young of Hornsey. Research In January 2016, Agenda published research claiming that one in 20 women in England have experienced extensive physical and sexual violence as both a child and an adult. The research also claims that women with the most extensive experiences of abuse also had very high rates of mental ill-health, disability, substance misuse, homelessness and poverty.

Wright was a professional right-arm fast- medium bowler and a right-handed lower-order batsman who frequently contributed useful runs. After a few matches in 1921 and 1922, he became a regular member of the Kent team in 1923 and remained a regular choice until the middle of the 1931 season, when he lost form and was dropped, not regaining his place in the side. Wright and George Collins provided the seam bowling alternative to the spin of Tich Freeman and Frank Woolley which dominated Kent's bowling across the 1920s. Both his best batting and bowling performances came in the 1924 season, relatively early in his first-class career. Against Essex in June 1924 in the second innings he scored 81, putting on 157 in about 75 minutes for the eighth wicket with the debutant Alan Hilder, which stood as the Kent record for that wicket until 2007. In August of the same year, he took five Somerset wickets for 33 runs in the first innings and followed that with seven for 31 in the second innings, providing both his best innings and match figures. In 1925, in the match against Warwickshire, Wright was the first victim in a sequence of four wickets in five balls by the Warwickshire player Robert Cooke; in Warwickshire's second innings, Wright returned the favour with a hat-trick in which Cooke was one of his victims. Wright's best seasons as a bowler were 1926 and 1927 and in both of these years he took more than 100 wickets at an average below 21 runs per wicket. His aggregates fell away from 1928 as Freeman came to dominate Kent's bowling almost single-handedly, and he was also more expensive from 1928 onwards. He remained a useful lower-order batsman, and passed 50 nine times in all, scoring more than 500 runs in both 1924 and 1929.

Other goals sometimes include fast changes in production levels based on demand,SMLC 2011 optimization of the supply chain, efficient production and recyclability. In this concept, as smart factory has interoperable systems, multi-scale dynamic modelling and simulation, intelligent automation, strong cyber security, and networked sensors. The broad definition of smart manufacturing covers many different technologies. Some of the key technologies in the smart manufacturing movement include big data processing capabilities, industrial connectivity devices and services, and advanced robotics. Graphic of a sample manufacturing control system showing the interconnectivity of data analysis, computing and automation. 463x463px  Big data processing  Smart manufacturing utilizes big data analytics, to refine complicated processes and manage supply chains. Big data analytics refers to a method for gathering and understanding large data sets in terms of what are known as the three V's, velocity, variety and volume. Velocity informs the frequency of data acquisition, which can be concurrent with the application of previous data. Variety describes the different types of data that may be handled. Volume represents the amount of data. Big data analytics allows an enterprise to use smart manufacturing to predict demand and the need for design changes rather than reacting to orders placed. Some products have embedded sensors, which produce large amounts of data that can be used to understand consumer behavior and improve future versions of the product.  Advanced robotics  Advanced industrial robots, also known as smart machines operate autonomously and can communicate directly with manufacturing systems. In some advanced manufacturing contexts, they can work with humans for co-assembly tasks. By evaluating sensory input and distinguishing between different product configurations, these machines are able to solve problems and make decisions independent of people. These robots are able to complete work beyond what they were initially programmed to do and have artificial intelligence that allows them to learn from experience. These machines have the flexibility to be reconfigured and re-purposed. This gives them the ability to respond rapidly to design changes and innovation, which is a competitive advantage over more traditional manufacturing processes. An area of concern surrounding advanced robotics is the safety and well-being of the human workers who interact with robotic systems. Traditionally, measures have been taken to segregate robots from the human workforce, but advances in robotic cognitive ability have opened up opportunities, such as cobots, for robots to work collaboratively with people.  Industrial connectivity devices and services  Leveraging the capabilities of the Internet, manufacturers are able to increase integration and data storage. Employing cloud software allows companies access to highly configurable computing resources. This allows for servers, networks and other storage applications to be created and released at a rapid pace. Enterprise integration platforms allow the manufacturer to collect data broadcast from its machines, which can track metrics such as work flow and machine history. Open communication between manufacturing devices and networks can also be achieved through Internet connectivity. This encompasses everything from tablets to machine automation sensors and allows for machines to adjust their processes based on input from external devices.  3D printing  As of 2019, 3D printing is mainly used in rapid prototyping, design iteration, and small-scale production. Improvements in speed, quality, and materials could make it useful in mass production and mass customization.  Eliminating workplace inefficiencies and hazards  Smart manufacturing can also be attributed to surveying workplace inefficiencies and assisting in worker safety. Efficiency optimization is a huge focus for adopters of \\"smart\\" systems, which is done through data research and intelligent learning automation. For instance operators can be given personal access cards with inbuilt Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, which can connect to the machines and a Cloud platform to determine which operator is working on which machine in real time. An intelligent, interconnected 'smart' system can be established to set a performance target, determine if the target is obtainable, and identify inefficiencies through failed or delayed performance targets. In general, automation may alleviate inefficiencies due to human error. And in general, evolving AI eliminates the inefficiencies of its predecessors. Worker safety can be augmented by safe, innovative design and increasing integrated networks of automation. This is under the notion that Technicians are exposed less to hazardous environments as automation matures. If successful, less human supervision and user instruction for automation will devitalize workplace safety concerns.  Impact of Industry 4.0  Industrial revolutions and future view Industry 4.0 is a project in the high-tech strategy of the German government that promotes the computerization of traditional industries such as manufacturing. The goal is the intelligent factory (Smart Factory) that is characterized by adaptability, resource efficiency, and ergonomics, as well as the integration of customers and business partners in business and value processes. Its technological foundation consists of cyber-physical systems and the Internet of Things. This kind of \\"intelligent manufacturing\\" makes a great use of: * Wireless connections, both during product assembly and long-distance interactions with them; * Last generation sensors, distributed along the supply chain and the same products (Internet of things) * Elaboration of a great amount of data to control all phases of construction, distribution and usage of a good. European Roadmap \\"Factories of the Future\\" and German one \\"Industrie 4.0‚Ä≥ illustrate several of the action lines to undertake and the related benefits. Some examples are: * Advanced manufacturing processes and rapid prototyping will make possible for each customer to order one-of-a-kind product without significant cost increase. * Collaborative Virtual Factory (VF) platforms will drastically reduce cost and time associated to new product design and engineering of the production process, by exploiting complete simulation and virtual testing throughout the Product Lifecycle. * Advanced Human-Machine interaction (HMI) and augmented reality (AR) devices will help increasing safety in production plants and reducing physical demand to workers (whose age has an increasing trend). * Machine learning will be fundamental to optimize the production processes, both for reducing lead times and reducing the energy consumption. * Cyber-physical systems and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication will allow to gather and share real-time data from the shop floor in order to reduce down and idle times by conducting extremely effective predictive maintenance. Smart Manufacturing Paradigms In this section, the leading visions for the future of smart manufacturing are discussed and for each one, different examples from leading industry and research organizations are presented. =Cyber Physical Systems in Smart Manufacturing= As one of the main elements of Industry 4.0, cyber-physical systems play a significant role in the future of smart manufacturing systems. * Connection Layer Systems, comments, machines, and humans are essential parts of manufacturing systems and their contributions highly depend on their connection with the rest of the manufacturing elements. For instance, an operator may require advanced intelligence from the production system in order to make the most efficient decisions for scheduling maintenance or production orders. Advanced communication technologies such as 5G technology would significantly enhance connectivity across manufacturing systems. * Cyber Layer This layer is a central hub for data storage where big data analytic tools are utilized for a better and more efficient decision making. A digital twin can be realized in this layer by integrating cyberspace to the physical components through tactile internet. Moreover, similarity-based methods can be used to perform peer to peer comparison across machines and help in better fault diagnosis and enhancing their efficiency. * Cognition layer In this layer, infographic tools are utilized to present the results of analytic studies to the users. Simple radar charts and degradation trends can be used for a simple representation of the component's health condition. Then operators can easily make a decision based on the presented data. * Configuration layer In this layer, the decisions made in the Cognition layer are applied to the physical system to make the systems self-adapt, self-configure, and self resilient. Statistics The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in South Korea announced on 10 March 2016 that it had aided the construction of smart factories in 1,240 small and medium enterprises, which it said resulted in an average 27.6% decrease in defective products, 7.1% faster production of prototypes, and 29.2% lower cost.  Action and effects  From Siemens' perspective, there are three core elements to this evolution: # Manufacturing execution. Manufacturing execution will play an even more important role. The degree of connectivity between the automation level and the manufacturing execution system (MES) will increase significantly, also across the borders of companies and locations. The integration of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and MES levels will also advance to achieve complete transparency as well as connectivity to business data. That means that all necessary information is available in real time. # The merging of the product and production life cycle. The second core element is the merging of product and production life cycle based on a common data model. This will allow manufacturers to meet the challenges that result through ever-shorter product life cycles, both technically and in business. # Cyber-physical systems. Cyber-physical systems are a basis for the increase in manufacturing flexibility that results in shorter time to market. These production units can be flexibly integrated into existing production processes. Cyber physical systems combine communications, IT, data, and physical elements using core technologies, including sensor networks; Internet communication infrastructure; intelligent, real-time processing and event management; big data and data provisioning; embedded software for logic; and automated operations and management of systemic activities across enterprises.

Politically, Frankfurt was a Free Imperial City of the Holy Roman Empire. Preliminary situation In the summer of 1554, the English exile community in Frankfurt was sharing a church with the congregation of Val√©rand Poullain, and was led by the expatriate William Whittingham. They adopted liturgical practices, under some pressure from the local magistrates, that differed from what was laid down in the Second Prayer Book of Edward VI, of 1552. When Whittingham sent a declaration of unity to other exile groups, in August, Strasburg prepared to send one of more its leaders, to take matters in hand. The Frankfurt group responded by making known its intention to elect three ministers. T According to A Brief Discourse, the major source for these events, John Knox was sent as a minister to Frankfurt from Geneva by John Calvin. He led the opposition to the \\"prayerbook faction\\", the supporters of the 1552 Prayer Book. Edmund Grindal came with a group from Strasburg, and had dealings with Knox. Grindal then wrote about the situation to Nicholas Ridley in England; who found the local compromise, in line with what happened for other exile groups, quite reasonable, but had some criticism of Knox's approach. Knox and Whittingham at this point pushed for a definition of essentials in the Prayer Book, causing Grindal to depart rather than be seen to negotiate. Compromise attempts The initial conflict centered on the order of the communion service. Knox would not use the Genevan order since it would offend others, but neither would he allow the use of the English prayerbook form. Thomas Lever led an attempt to construct a compromise order. The prayerbook faction was led by Richard Cox, who had left Strasburg to correct the situation in Frankfurt. However, others in Strasbourg and some who had moved from there to Frankfurt, opposed the prayerbook, so both congregations were divided from within. Some people may have remained out of the fight, and others, like Lever, changed sides over time. (In Knox's own account, Lever‚Äîwho was his co-preacher‚Äîfailed to support him and thereby exacerbated the division.) Knox found supporters in Whittingham (Cox's former student), Richard Chambers, Anthony Gilby, Thomas Cole, Edward Sutton, Thomas Wood, William Williams, John Staunton, William Hammon, Michael Gill, and others. Knox and Whittingham wrote a Latin summary of the English prayerbook and sent it to Calvin for his opinion which was that it contained \\"many tolerable foolish things.\\" Knox, Whittingham, Foxe, and Thomas Cole drafted what they thought would be an ideal order, but it was rejected by the prayerbook faction. It was later used at Geneva by the English congregation under Knox.Peter Hume Brown (1895) John Knox: a biography, A. and C. Black, London (Digitized by Google) Adiaphora In the process of the prayerbook dispute, Calvin weighed in when consulted to promote unity and compromise, although he agreed with those who took a low view of the prayerbook. As during the earlier Vestments controversy under Edward VI, the concept of adiaphora or \\"things indifferent\\" was once more a crux of debate, rather than helping to build consensus. The result was that adiaphora was eventually abandoned as an arguing point on each side.Christina Hallowell Garrett (1938) Marian Exiles: A Study in the Origins of Elizabethan Puritanism, Cambridge University Press Exacerbation of the dispute A compromise order, really a version of the prayerbook service that retained much of it, was nearly accepted by 13 March 1555, just as a new group of English refugees, including John Jewel, was brought in by Cox. The newcomers strongly objected to the compromise liturgy, which omitted the litany with the congregations' spoken responses. Tensions increased since it was known that some of the new arrivals, like Jewel, had subscribed to Roman Catholic doctrines under Mary before they left England. Jewel preached a sermon in which he confessed his fault; but the more zealous exiles who were also prone to dislike Cox, a considerable pluralist, while the holding of multiple benefices was something \\"hot gospellers\\" under Edward VI had preached against. In May 1555 Knox preached on precisely this topic in Cox's presence, attacking the prayerbook and the scandal of pluralities. Knox nevertheless defied his own supporters in pleading that Cox's group be admitted as members of the congregation, which gave the prayerbook faction a majority. Another settlement was in sight, when Knox's staunchest antagonists notified the local magistrates about Knox's An Admonition to Christians (1554). It disparaged Phillip II, Mary I, and Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, whom Knox compared to Nero. Some of Knox's detractors felt that such radical language offended even sympathetic rulers and encouraged Roman Catholic persecution of Protestants in England and elsewhere. Notably John Hooper had just been burned at the stake in February, and his wife and children were among the Frankfurt exile community. The prayerbook faction, also availed itself of a divisive argument, that it was presumptuous to attempt to be liturgically purer than those who had accepted the prayerbook and were martyred back in England. Departure of Knox Knox was asked to leave Frankfurt, and he did so on March 26. Sympathisers led by William Whittingham (Thomas Cole and John Foxe among them) left for Basel and Geneva. Conflict, which had preceded Knox's presence, continued. Historiography The criticism Ridley had of Knox was suppressed in published versions of his letter during the 1560, by Miles Coverdale and John Foxe. The extended conflicts are documented in a single printed source: the narrative and reprinted correspondence that comprise A Brieff discours off the troubles begonne at Franckford ... A.D. 1554. This book was printed anonymously in 1575 (though one extant copy is dated 1574) and reprinted in 1642, 1707‚Äì08, 1846, and 1907. It may have been issued in response to a sermon delivered at St. Paul's Cross on the subject of the Genevan form of church discipline then advocated by John Field. Though it remains uncertain, the book's editor is commonly identified as William Whittingham. Patrick Collinson has made a case for Thomas Wood as the editor, and M. A. Simpson has questioned the assumption that there was a single author behind A Brief Discourse who was part of the debates it concerns. Much of its material must have come to its compiler(s) from other hands, the letters it contains vary in apparent authenticity, and the documentary sources behind it are no longer extant except, in adapted form, parts of John Knox's account of his time in Frankfurt. Noting these things, Simpson conjectures that A Brief Discourse was the product of several editors, the last of whom he believes to have been John Field. The title page advertises A Brief Discourse as an explanation of the nature and origins of the conflicts in the Church of England then taking place and the emergence of separatism and Presbyterianism. It is partisan history.

Issa has participated in numerous solo and group exhibitions. Her most notable shows include the solo exhibition, Iman Issa: Heritage Studies at MACBA, Barcelona, Iman Issa: Heritage Studiesat the P√©rez Art Museum Miami (PAMM), and Material at Rodeo, Istanbul. Her videography has been featured at the Transmediale, Berlin, Institute of Contemporary Art, London, Tate Modern, London, Spacex, Exeter, Open Eye Gallery, Liverpool, and Bidoun Artists' Cinema. She lectures at the New School and is currently a part-time professor at the Cooper Union's School of Arts. Issa lives and works between Cairo and New York City.  Early life and education  Iman Issa was born in Cairo, Egypt in 1979. In 2001, she completed her bachelor's degree at the American University in Cairo. She initially studied philosophy and political science, and then continued to pursue photography when the university launched a visual arts program. Issa moved to New York in 2005, and completed her MFA at Columbia University two years later.  Artistic practice  Iman Issa has been producing art since 2001 in various mediums including sculpture, text, video, and photography. Memory and familiarity permeate Issa's work as she navigates through history, language, and political and civic duty. She incorporates three major themes in her art: specificity, site, and movement. Curator Ryan Inoyue of Sharjah Biennial 12 writes that Issa has \\"developed an aesthetic that mines the latent meaning and transformational potential of objects, ideas, and figures that appear out of sync with our times.\\" Many of her artworks have been inspired by existing monuments or objects but these initial sources of inspiration remain unknown. Hints are provided in subjective titles which describe something about the original work, but in subverting titular restrictions, Issa opens up her works for reinterpretation and communication. Her artwork is aesthetically minimalist and at times, incorporates various mediums to culminate in one artwork she calls a \\"display.\\"Inouye, Ryan. ‚ÄúSeeing Yourself Seeing.‚Äù Iman Issa: Heritage Studies. Miami: Perez Art Museum Miami, 2015. 13‚Äì21. Print. = Notable artworks = Heritage Studies (2015‚ÄîOngoing)  Heritage Studies is an ongoing series of paired sculptures and texts that explores the void between object and history, unsettling the stability of form and meaning as cultural objects navigating through time and space. Unlike her previous series, Heritage Studies focuses on artifacts from ethnographic and anthropological museums whose meanings are constructed by their designations which she feels have a \\"particular resonance and communicative ability in the present.\\" Issa engages these objects with history as an existent to designate relationships between sites and artifacts that are contemporarily relevant. Each artwork is presented as a museological display with predetermined didactic labels by the artist. These labels and texts are ambiguous; for example, Heritage Studies #10's copper cylindrical shape evokes an existing monument with only the suggestions of a plaque which reads \\"Column from the Great Colonnade of the Newly Founded Capital Samarra.\\" This sculpture has been acquired by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York and will be featured in the upcoming show, But a Storm is Blowing from Paradise: Contemporary Art of the Middle East and North Africa. This body of works has been displayed in solo exhibitions at MACBA and PAMM.  Lexicon (2012‚ÄîOngoing)  This series pairs objects and texts to reevaluate and reinterpret visual art from the 20th century. Issa aims to unpack the possibilities of the original works' titles in order to offer new physical expression of their meanings. Issa remakes historical artworks‚Äî including drawings, oil paintings, and lithographs‚Äîby presenting framed texts that detail the original work with a new reinterpreted artwork, never disclosing the original art. The display's title is only a hint. The viewer's role is to then reconsider the relationship between object and language; he or she reads the accompanying text that describes the initial artwork and must reconcile Issa's new object. Lexicon was first shown in 2014 at the 8th Berlin Biennial and shown again in 2015 at Rodeo Gallery, London.  Common Elements (2013)  This installation was first revealed in the Abraaj Group Art Prize exhibition, \\"extra  ordinary\\" in 2013. It consists of 54 framed text panels, 14 framed chromogenic prints, five wooden sculptures, five painted white plinths, and a caption. The text panels feature quotes from the famous Arab writers: Edward Said, Mourid Barghouti, Taha Hussein, and Nawal Al-Saadawi. Issa picked five autobiographies from the aforementioned writers and lifted excerpts that communicated snippets of their lives tied to broader socio-political context. Functioning as one comprehensive installation, each component contributing to the overall narrative Issa wished to communicate.  Material (2010‚Äî2012)  In this body of work, Issa considers sculpture studies as proposals to replace existing monuments she has known since she was a child. Issa understands the language of monuments and memorials to be limiting and simplistic but used the constraints to probe for deeper context. Once again, the titles of displays are vaguely reminiscent of existing monuments, yet she named them subjectively. One example title is Material for a sculpture commemorating an economist whose name now marks the streets and squares he once frequented; these titles draw on memory and experience to engage populism and political expediency of the original statues.Wilson-Goldie, Kaelen. ‚ÄúIman Issa: Radical Subtraction.‚Äù Bidoun Magazine Spring 2012: 18‚Äì21. Print.  The Revolutionary (2010)  This is an audio piece written by Issa and narrated by text-to-speech software which creates an image of a potentially revolutionary character.  Triptychs (2009)  Each display in Triptychs has three parts: on the left is a small shot of an urban space, a larger photograph with a neutral background displaying disparate subjects, and a three-dimensional element on a shelf or stand. Issa initiated her series by taking images of alluring spaces she frequented that triggered memories and associations for her.  Awards  Belvedere 21er Haus Artist in Residence (2015) Abraaj Group Art Prize (2013) Issa is one of five Middle Eastern artists to receive the Abraaj Group Art Prize at Art Dubai where the winning works were revealed in an exhibition titled 'extra  ordinary'. The show focused on projects which explored the boundaries of artistic medium and geographic borders. Issa featured an installation titled Common Elements, and is the third Egyptian artist to win the prize. Fellow awardees include Hrair Sarkissian, Vartan Avakian, Rayyane Tabet, and Huma Mulji. Han Nefkens Foundation-MACBA Contemporary Art Award (2012) Issa unanimously won the inaugural Han Nefkens Foundation- MACBA Contemporary Art Award and the jury cited the following reasons for this decision: # \\"Iman Issa has achieved a level of visual and critical maturity that is rare in artists of her generation. # She has a complex, prolific body of work and a highly developed formal sense expressed through the skilled use of various media. # Her artistic and intellectual trajectory testifies to a constantly developing artistic practice and critical vision, a fertile imagination, and a capacity to engage, question, and challenge the viewer.\\" Platform Garanti Contemporary Art Center, Accented Residency (2010) Young Arab Theatre Fund Production Grant (2010) The Arab Fund for Arts and Culture Grant (2009)  Exhibitions = Solo exhibitions = *Lights, Gezira Arts Center, Cairo, 2002 *Proposal For A Crystal Building, Gezira Arts Center, Cairo, 2003 *Making Places, Townhouse Gallery of Contemporary Art, Cairo, 2008 *Subjective Projections, Bielefelder Kunstverein, Bielefeld, 2010 *Triptychs, Present Future, Artissima 17, Turin, 2010 *MaterialRodeo, Istanbul, 2011 *MaterialMercer Union, Toronto, 2012 *Iman Issa, Tensta Konsthall, Stockholm, 2013 *Post: Iman Issa, Kunsthal Charlottenborg, Copenhagen, 2013 *Lexicon, Rodeo, London, 2015 *Iman Issa, Perez Art Museum, Miami, 20 *Iman Issa, Glasgow Sculpture Studios Glasgow, 2015 *Heritage Studies, MACBA, Barcelona, 2015 *Iman Issa,, 21er Haus Vienna, 2015 *Reasonable Characters in Familiar Place., Kunsthalle Lissabon, Lisbon, 2015 = Group exhibitions = This is a selective list - a more comprehensive accounting of group exhibitions including Issa may be found on her artist's page at Rodeo Gallery: *Memorial To The Iraq War, ICA, London, 2007 *‚ÄúShe Doesn‚Äôt Know It But She‚Äôs Dressed For The H-Bomb,‚Äù Tank.TV, London, 2008 *7th Gwangju Biennale, Gwangju, 2008 *CAIROSCAPE, Cultural Center of the City of Athens, Athens, 2008 *Look Around, Galleria Artericambi, Verona, 2008 *Self Storage, The Hardware Store Gallery, San Francisco, 2008 *Totale Erinnerung, 3 Fotofestival Manneheim Ludwigshafen Heidelberg, Heidelberg, 2009 *Trapped In Amber, UKS, Oslo, 2009 *Dwelling In Travel, Center for Contemporary Art ‚Äì The Ancient Bath, Plovdiv, 2010 *The Night Of Future Past, Scotiabank Nuit Blanche, Toronto, 2010 *Why Not, Palace of Arts, Cairo, 2010 *Propaganda By Monuments, CIC, Cairo, 2011 *Seeing Is Believing, KW Institute of Contemporary Art, Berlin, 2011 *Short Stories: Iman Issa and Ben Schumacher, SculptureCenter, New York, 2011 *5th Bucharest Biennale, Alert Studio, Bucharest, 2012 *Abstract Possible: The Stockholm Synergies, Tensta Konsthall, Stockholm, 2012 *Material Information, Permanenten West Norway Museum of Decorative Art, Bergen, 2012 *PhotoCairo 5, CIC, Cairo, 2012 *Ruptures.

The game was released worldwide on 13 January 2016 for iOS and Android devices. The game is based on Rick and Morty and the mechanics serve as a parody of the Pok√©mon franchise. Description Pocket Mortys is based on the multiple timeline concept as described in episode 10 of season 1, \\"Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind\\". The game uses a style and concept similar to the Pok√©mon games, with catching various 'wild' Mortys, battling them with a variety of 'Trainers' in the form of aliens, Ricks and several supporting characters. The game features voice acting from Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon. =Gameplay= Pocket Mortys is in a third- person view, overhead perspective and consists of three basic screens: an overworld, in which the player navigates the main character; a side-view battle screen; and a menu interface, in which the player configures their Mortys, items, or gameplay settings. The player can use their Mortys to battle other Mortys. Supposedly the strongest Morty so far is The One True Morty later revealed in the game. Wild Mortys are visible on the overworld and can be battled. \\"Trainer\\" fights are also visible and entail fighting against their party of up to five Mortys. When the player encounters a Morty or a trainer, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen that displays the engaged Mortys. During battle, the player may select a maneuver for their Morty to use in the fight, use an item, switch their active Morty, or (against the wild Mortys) attempt to flee. Mortys have hit points (HP); when a Morty's HP is reduced to zero, it gets dazed and can no longer battle until it is revived. Once an enemy Morty faints, the player's Morty involved in the battle receive a certain number of experience points (EXP). After accumulating enough EXP, a Morty will level up. A Morty's level controls its physical properties, such as the battle statistics acquired, and the moves learned. The player may combine two Mortys of the same type to evolve them; these evolutions affect the statistics and which moves are learned. Catching wild Mortys is another essential element of the gameplay. During battle with a wild Morty, the player may throw a Manipulation Chip at it. If the Morty is successfully caught, it will come under the ownership of the player. The ultimate goal of the game is to collect and level-up a team of Mortys to battle against the Council of Ricks, who have taken Rick's portal gun until he proves himself to be worthy of getting it back. Reception The game received \\"generally favorable\\" reception, according to review aggregator Metacritic. PC Magazine gave the game a rating of 3.5/5, and Patricia Hernandez of Kotaku stated that the game was \\"brilliant\\". IGN was not as favourable in its review, giving the game a \\"mediocre\\" 5.5 rating, stating that the game \\"lacks cohesion\\" and that it was \\"little more than a diluted Pok√©mon imitator\\". HardcoreGamer mirrored this opinion by giving the game a score of 2.5/5. With the commercial success of the game, it prompted Adult Swim Games to acquire Big Pixel Studios two years and four months later on May 21, 2018.https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/21/adult-swim-acquires-pocket-mortys- developer-big-pixel-studios/ References Category:2016 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Free-to-play video games Category:IOS games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Video games based on Rick and Morty Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Pocket mortys Cheats and Crafting Recipes,top 30 crafting recipe ","title":"Pocket Mortys"},{"id":"49260741","text":"The Pravara Rural Education Society (PRES) was established in July 1964 at Pravara, Loni, a large village in Maharashtra state in India.

She is the founder of Kaladiksha, an institution promoting Bharatanatyam and striving to preserve the Pandanallur tradition. A disciple of the father-son duo of Chokkalingam Pillai and Subbaraya Pillai, she is a recipient of several honours including Kalaimamani Award of the Government of Tamil Nadu and the Natya Kala Sarathi of Sri Parthasarathy Swami Sabha. The Government of India awarded her the fourth highest civilian honour of the Padma Shri, in 2008, for her contributions to classical dance.  Biography  Meenakshi Chitharanjan was born in Chennai, in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu to Sabanagayam, a government official, as the youngest and only girl child among his five children. Her mother, Savithri, sent the girl to Pandanallur Chockalingam Pillai, a renowned Bharatanatyam guru, when the child was four, and after training under the Pillai and his son, Subbaraya Pillai, she staged her arangetram (debut) in 1966 at the age of nine. Soon, she moved to Delhi when her father was transferred to the Indian capital, but continued her dance studies under Subbaraya Pillai by visiting Chennai during holidays. She did her college studies at Ethiraj College for Women and married Arun Chitharanjan, an orthodontist and the grandson of M. Bhaktavatsalam, the then chief minister of Tamil Nadu, after which her dance career halted for a while. She returned to dancing after a chance meeting with Srinivasa Pillai, a percussionist who had played mridangam as an accompaniment to her in her younger days. She also trained abhinaya under Kalanidhi Narayanan, a Padma Bhushan awardee, and has been performing on stage since then. Srinivasa Pillai, S. Pandian and Padma Subrahmanyam have also trained her at various points of time. In 1991, she started Kaladiksha, a dance school for teaching Bharatanatyam which has since grown to hold around 100 students at a time and is known to be striving to preserve the Pandanallur bani.

It has been recognized as a Geographical indication by the Government of India in 2008‚Äì09. History During the reign of Chola empire, Raja Raja I commissioned a group of sculptors for the construction of the Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur. The sculptors helped cast statues for Airavatesvara Temple and later settled at Swamimalai. Production The icons range from to in height. The production is closely controlled and limited in number to maintain quality. The statues made mainly include that of Hindu deities. Other icons of animals, figures of males and females are also cast based on requirements. The statues are made using the technique of wax casting and the cast can be of two types - solid and hollow cast. Solid wax casts are traditionally used and the model of the required image is cast as a mould filled with wax, made by mixing pure bee wax with resin from the Platanus orientalis and ground nut oil in the ratio 4:4:1. The wax pattern is coated with three layers of clay known as investment with each layer made from different clay. The first coat about 3 mm thick is made when fine loam or alluvial soil collected from the Kaveri river bed finely ground with charred paddy husk mixed with cow dung, the second layer by mixing clay from paddy fields with sand and the third layer being a mix of coarse sand with clay. For large statues, the clay coating is reinforced using metal rods. The mould is heated to remove the wax and the molten metal is poured into the mould. During historic times, the molten metal was an alloy of five metals: gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead, known as Panchaloha. As gold and silver are expensive, they are replaced by tin and iron. Once the metal cools, the mould is broken and the metal statue is polished further to produce the icon. Measurements The sculptor takes measurements using units of measurement laid down in Shilpa Shastras for icon making. The basic unit of measurement is tala, which is the distance between the hairline and the end of the lower jaw. The tala is divided into 12 equal parts called angula (roughly equivalent to the breadth of a finger) which is further divided into eight yava (the size of a barley grain) and so on until the smallest unit, a paramu (smaller than the end of a single hair). The measurements are noted using a narrow ribbon of coconut tree leaf cut to the icon length requirement and folded at different lengths in proportion to the length of various parts of the icon. Artisans About 1200 people in Swamimalai are involved in metal sculpting. The artisans are known as sthapathis, who are traditionally from the Vishwakarma community and have practiced metal casting for several generations. Export The bronze icons made in Swamimalai are in high demand and are exported to number of countries including United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Switzerland, Malaysia and Thailand. About 60 percent of the total production is exported and the statues are installed in Hindu temples built in various countries by NRIs.

Fueled by wood pellets, they can smoke as well as grill and bake using an electronic control panel to automatically feed fuel pellets to the fire, regulate the grill‚Äôs airflow, and maintain consistent cooking temperatures.  History = Early history and development = Pellet grills have their beginnings in pellet stoves. During the 1973 oil crisis, an increased demand for affordable home heating spearheaded a push toward alternative heat sources, which would later include wood pellets. Wood pellets were invented in the United States in the late 1970s, they are small eraser-sized capsules made of compressed sawdust. By the early 1980s Jerry Whitfield, a Boeing aviation engineer from Washington, and Joe Traeger, who ran a family-owned heating company in Oregon, were each experimenting with pellet-burning stoves. Although the stoves looked like traditional wood stoves, they worked much differently. Run by electricity, the pellet stoves utilized a motor-driven auger to deliver a specific amount of pellets from the storage hopper to a fire pot, where a fan aided combustion and blew the warm air from the stove. =Traeger grills= A Traeger Grill c. 1994. Note the side-mounted hopper where the pellets are stored. Joe Traeger developed the Traeger pellet grill in 1985 and patented it in 1986. Early Traeger Grills, as well as many of the pellet grills first introduced after the expiration of the Traeger patent, used a three-position controller, called an LMH controller indicating settings for low, medium and high heat. Each setting approximates a temperature range, and those temperatures were achieved by means of a fixed, predetermined duty cycle. Furthermore, because the duty cycles are fixed, they don't account for weather conditions or the amount of food being cooked, both of which affect temperature. As a result of its patent, Traeger was the only manufacturer of pellet grills for twenty years. During that time, the company remained a small family-run business that distributed its pellet grills to a limited network of stores. After Traeger's patent expired in 2006, the company experienced competition from other manufacturers using the same design principles.  Function  Wood Pellets Although pellet stoves and pellet grills both run on wood pellets, there are differences in the pellets they burn. In addition to hardwood, pellets used for home heating often contain softwood and biomass scrap (such as bark), both of which can produce a bad taste and could be harmful if ingested. Pellet grills, on the other hand, use food-grade pellets that are made entirely from hardwood and contain no additives, although some manufacturers use soybean oil or vegetable oil as a lubricant during production. Because of their small size and composition, food-grade pellets burn cleanly, producing a light smoky flavor. Wood pellet varieties include oak, maple, apple, alder, mesquite, cherry, maple, hickory, and pecan. This method of cooking, known as indirect (or convection) cooking is also used by traditional charcoal and wood smokers. That similarity, and the fact that wood pellets produce smoke that flavors food, resulted in many early adopters turning to pellet grills as an easy-to-use alternative to traditional smokers. Some pellet grill manufacturers have implemented Wi-Fi-enabled controls that allow for remote monitoring of the grill. Pellet grill technology is being integrated into other cooking devices, such as traditional ceramic Kamado style grills, and pizza ovens. = Temperature control = Pellet grill operation Pellet grill temperatures are largely determined by the amount of fuel consumed by the fire and airflow regulation. However, unlike grills, pellet grills use automated fuel and air delivery, and can maintain a user- selected temperature. Although this reduces user workload, the process that makes it possible is more complex than traditional grills. First, the desired temperature is programmed into the electronic control panel. A motor-driven auger then feeds a small amount of pellets from the hopper to the fire pot. Igniter rods light the pellets and prime the fire, raising the grill to an initial starting temperature of to , depending on the manufacturer. Once the fire is ready, the desired temperature is achieved via a repeated duty cycle, which represents a segment of time when the auger is active and idle. A single duty cycle starts when the auger turns on and begins feeding pellets then continues through the period when it shuts off and remains idle. The duty cycle ends when the auger turns on again. For example, a pellet grill set to might have an auger-on period of 10 seconds followed by an auger-off period of 50 seconds. Duty cycles are typically stated as a percentage that represents the amount of time the auger is running‚Äîan auger that's always on has a 100% duty cycle, while one that is on half the time has a 50% duty cycle. Each temperature setting has a different duty cycle. However, regardless of that temperature setting, the auger-on portion of the duty cycle remains constant. The auger-off period is the variable. Lower temperatures have longer auger-off periods, while high temperatures have shorter. Multi-position and digital controllers A Multi-Position Controller Rather than use multi-position controllers, some brands have switched to fully digital control panels that, in addition to a LED display, use a one-touch interface similar to a kitchen oven. Digital controllers utilize simple microprocessors that work in conjunction with the sensors to create a feedback loop, allowing the pellet grill to make small adjustments to auger activity. The sensor measures the grill temperature and sends the information to the controller, which initiates or halts the auger when the grill exceeds or falls below a specified threshold. In addition to providing more temperature options, multi-position and digital controllers developed more refined auger duty cycles. The shorter auger-on period allows the pellet grill to achieve and maintain a wider range of temperatures. It also keeps large amounts of pellets from pilling up in the fire pot, helping to prevent sudden, sharp temperature swings. =PID controllers (adjustable duty cycle)= Similar to other controllers, when the desired temperature is programmed into a PID controller, the pellet grill ignites the pellets and begins an initial warm-up to a predetermined temperature. Once that has been reached, the pellet grill begins climbing toward the programmed temperature. As it does, the PID controller undergoes a process of trial and error, fine tuning the rate at which pellets are fed by learning how long and how much fuel it takes to raise the pellet grill's temperature under the current conditions. Using an advanced algorithm, the PID controller applies this data to calculate a duty cycle that will achieve the desired temperature. As the pellet grill rises toward the programmed temperature, it will continuously take readings and adjust the duty cycle as necessary. Even after the target temperature has been met, these adjustments continue throughout the duration of the cook. The constant monitoring of temperatures and recalculation of the duty cycle enables pellet grills that use PID controllers to hit the target temperature and maintain it for hours. =Induction fans= A significant factor in pellet grill temperature control is the ability to regulate airflow to the fire. The improvement in induction fans has paralleled the advancement in controllers. Early pellet grills had fans that ran continuously once the power was turned on. That meant oxygen was constantly being fed to the fire, making it harder to control temperatures. Eventually, continuous fans were replaced by ones that ran in conjunction with the auger-on cycle. However, that still meant that every time pellets were being fed to the fire, so was oxygen. As a result, some manufacturers have incorporated intermittent fans into pellet grills. These fans work independent of the auger and can turn on and off to feed oxygen to the fire only when necessary.

It is located at the end of Cantick Head, a long peninsula on the south-eastern coast of South Walls that overlooks the Pentland Firth and the Sound of Hoxa, which forms the southern entry to the natural harbour of Scapa Flow. South Walls is joined to the larger island of Hoy by a narrow causeway, allowing road access to the village of Longhope, Hackness and then the lighthouse further to the south- east. History The lighthouse by night The need for the lighthouse was first raised by the Northern Lights Commissioners in 1854 and was quickly approved, but delays in agreeing the details for the light and that of the buildings meant that construction did not start until two years later in 1856. The design and construction was overseen by the notable lighthouse engineers Thomas and David Stevenson. The light first entered service in 1858, and consists of a high cylinder-shaped tower, which is painted white. It supports a single gallery and a lantern with a black cupola. Adjacent to the tower are a set of keeper's cottages and subsidiary buildings, bounded by a walled compound containing a sundial. A principal keeper's house was a later addition. In 1913, a foghorn was installed at the station, which continued in use until 1987. In 1991 the light was converted to automatic operation, and the keeper's houses were sold and converted to holiday accommodation. In 2017, the accommodation including the first assistant, second assistant and principal keeper's houses were offered for sale at a price of ¬£300,000. With a focal height of above sea level, the light can be seen for . Its light characteristic is made up of a flash of white light every twenty seconds. The lighthouse is maintained by the Northern Lighthouse Board, and is registered under the international Admiralty number A3602 and has the NGA identifier of 114-3088.

He is described in the book The Tiffanys of America by Nelson Otis Tiffany: \\"in addition to making his living as a storekeeper and a farmer, was a brave soldier, good churchman, a writer of prose and poetry, and astronomer.\\" To date, his journal is the only firsthand account written of Nathan Hale's capture during the American Revolution. Tiffany was one of the first settlers of West Hartland, Connecticut. One of his manuscripts was donated to the Library of Congress by his patrilineal descendant, G. Bradford Tiffany. It is viewed by historians as an important primary source document for understanding the American Revolution and Nathan Hale. Tiffany wrote a broadside in a thirty four-stanza verse, called \\"Of the Melancholy Death of Six Young Persons Who Were Killed by Lightning in the Month of June, 1767\\", noting the deaths of Martin Wilcox, James Rice, Sarah Larkim, Joseph Young, Curtis Chuet, and William Burt. Another edition, with slight textual variations and eight additional stanzas also exists. The Tiffany Elm Tiffany planted an elm tree in 1775, which became known as the \\"Tiffany Elm.\\" It was the second largest tree in the state (circumference 21 feet, branch spread 100 feet), though some sources say it was the fourth largest tree in Connecticut at the time. In full bloom, the Tiffany Elm was known for its beauty and symmetry and its image became the seal for the Town of Hartland. Tiffany family history In 1901, Charles Lewis Tiffany, founder of Tiffany and Co., commissioned a family genealogy documenting the Tiffany family history back to Squire Humphrey Tiffany. Much is written of the \\"Consider Tiffany Line.\\" Consider Tiffany was the son of Consider Tiffany Sr. and Naomi Niles, who married in November 1731. His great- grandfather, Squire Humphrey Tiffany, is the forefather of the Tiffany family in the United States, arriving in America from Yorkshire, England in 1660. Squire Tiffany was killed by a lightning strike on July 15, 1685 while en route to Boston. Scholars have surmised that this death had an important impact on Consider Tiffany's writing, particularly his broadsides. Tiffany's wife Sarah Wilder was a descendant of Deacon Edmund Rice, founder of Sudbury, Massachusetts, and Thomasine Frost.

The name 'Mether' is said to be derived from 'meth' that is the old name for mead as in the Welsh for mead that is 'medd', and the word 'metheglin' derived from the compound word 'meddyglyn', 'healing liquor'. Examples of wooden methers have been recovered from Irish peat bogs. Another possibility is that the name may come from the Irish Gaelic ‚ÄúMehill‚Äù meaning a 'gathering'.Mullingar Pewter Methers The best known ancient Mether in Scotland is the Dunvegan Cup, which is a 10th-century wooden example provided with silver ornamentation in the 15th century. Probably Irish in origin but Belonging to the Clan MacLeod, the Dunvegan mether is held in the clan collection of artifacts at Dunvegan Castle. Characteristics Usually made of woods such as crab apple, alder, willow, sycamore, etc. with a four side top and oval or circular bottom. Methers have a number of handles, placed at the foot of the vessel and sometimes extending below the handle bottom to form feet as well as serving as handles.Gayre, Page 150. The actual number of these handles varies from one to four and the vessel itself varies from 6 to 12 inches (15 cm to 30 cm) in height with a capacity of from one to three pints. The multiple handles would make it easier to pass from one person to the next. Use Visitors were formally welcomed in 'peace and friendship' with a mether and the guest would pass the cup only to his right (sun-wise) for luck. The cup would be held in both hands. Intended also for the communal drinking and drinking bouts by the common people the mether is designed to be used by drinking from one of the four broad corners and if a drink is taken in haste the mead will flow onto the person concerned with humorous consequences adding to the festive air on the occasions of rural tasks such as funerals, weddings, fairs, sowing, haymaking, reaping, threshing, thatching, etc. Methers were also used for drinking other fluids such as milk, buttermilk, etc. =Methers= File:Mether - side view.JPG File:Mether with wine.JPG File:Mether - four lips and sides.JPG File:Sigerson Cup.jpg Small typical mether cups made from silver, not exceeding 3\\" in height (7.5 cm) and often with three to four handles were produced by silversmiths in the 18th and 20th centuries as presentation, such as the Sigerson Cup for Gaelic Football; the Liam MacCarthy Cup for Hurling; and christening cups. Pottery examples exist, such as examples of Hedingham-ware with four feet around 6 inches high. Mention in legend A 19th century engraving of the Dunvegan Cup. King Tuathal in the 2nd Century A.D. had seen a Roman drinking vessels with handles and decided to introduce this style to Ireland. The King instructed his smith as to what he wanted. Upon completing his task the smith held the cup by the handle so the king could not grasp the cup except by cupping it as he would normally. The smith was asked to add a second handle to overcome this but he now held the cup by both handles and the king was still left with no handle by which to take hold of the cup. A third handle was the solution but the smith now presented the vessel to Tuathal by holding the cup by two handles, the third pointing towards himself. A fourth handle was duly added, the final solution found and the mether born. The mether is mentioned in The Fate of the Children of Lir (14th century), when Fionnuala laments \\"There is our food and our wine, they are The white sand and bitter brine; ‚Äî [Yet] often drank we hazel mead. From round cups with four lips.\\" (original Middle Irish: chuach√°n cruinn cheithre g-cearn) Micro-history The library of the Royal Irish Academy holds a translation of The Hospitality of the House of Two Methers an Irish tale said to have been a favourite of St Patrick and part of the oral folklore of his day.

He was known for his prolific career in the museum world, most notably as the founding director of the Cleveland Museum of Art (1913-30) and later the president of the American Federation of Arts (1930-36). Early life On January 26, 1873, Frederic Allen Whiting was born in Oakdale, Tennessee to Frederic and Catherine Allen Whiting. The Whiting family originally hailed from Massachusetts, but the patriarch's work as the president of an iron company led the Whitings first to Tennessee and, later, to New Jersey, throughout the young Frederic's childhood. Apart from a few years in grammar school, Whiting had no formal education; he received his schooling primarily through tutoring at home. Whiting Family Portrait When Frederic was seventeen, the Whiting family moved to Lowell, Massachusetts, a town primarily fueled by its industry in textile manufacturing. Active in both his local church and community, Whiting initially planned to enter the ministry. Ultimately, however, his poor eyesight dissuaded him from pursuing this career.Bruce Robertson, \\"Frederic A. Whiting: Founding the Museum with Art and Craft,\\" in Object Lessons: Cleveland Creates an Art Museum, ed. Evan H. Turner (Cleveland: The Cleveland Museum of Art, 1991), 32. Soon after, Frederic entered into business, following the lead of his father and brothers. Although the Whitings remained in Lowell for just five years before moving closer to Boston in 1895, the blue-collar mill town had a lasting impact on Frederic, who remained there until 1897. The textile mills in Lowell attracted both migrant workers and European immigrants who were largely exploited as unskilled laborers. Whiting's early exposure to the harsh realities of industrial America developed his strong sense of civic duty and commitment to education. Demonstrating an early interest in community service, he began serving as treasurer of a charitable organization connected to his church, the Unity Congregational Church of Lowell. Whiting would later comment,\\"I think the most important factor was the social work in the mill town of Lowell, where I‚Ä¶spent a good deal of time in club work with mill boys.\\" His charitable work in Lowell continued to influence his conception of community and commitment to service throughout his life. Furthermore, these principles informed his later beliefs about the role that museums should play in their local communities, as evidenced by his tenure at The Cleveland Museum of Art. Career=Arts and Crafts Movement= Whiting's passions for education and art, namely the Arts and Crafts and handiwork, came together while he worked to establish himself as a leader in the arts community. With a career that started in business, he made an early transition into the world of art after meeting C. Howard Walker (1857-1936) of the Society for Arts and Crafts, Boston on a ship bound for England in 1898. A friendship was struck, and two years later Walker offered Whiting the paid position as secretary to the Society of Arts and Crafts, Boston.The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, \\"Frederic Allen Whiting,\\" Case Western Reserve University, last modified July 23, 1997, accessed September 1, 2015, http://ech.case.edu/cgi/article.pl?id=WFA. The society was an outgrowth of European societies much like the one founded by William Morris to encourage craftsmanship despite the industrial age. Whiting remained in this position for 12 years, establishing himself as a national advocate for industrial and decorative art objects, craftworks, and public education. Whiting's personal interest in handiwork was prioritized in both of his professional careers in arts institutions and in his personal life as well. Whiting organized the literary journal \\"Handicraft\\", published for the first time by The Society of Arts and Crafts, Boston in 1902.Barbara D. Aikens and Wendy Bruton, \\"A Finding Aid to the American Federation of Arts Records, 1895-1993 (bulk 1909-1969), in the Archives of American Art\\" The Smithsonian Institution Archives of American Art, 2000, Accessed September 1, 2015, http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/american-federation-arts-records-5411/more. He served as the original editor for the publication, which had a clear focus on educating its audience and connecting its community by distributing essays by artists and craftsmen, advertising craft shows, and listing local lecture and demonstration opportunities.Arthur Carey, Frederic Allen Whiting, Huger Elliott, Carl Purington Rollins, Handicraft IV (Montague, Mass.: The Dyke Mill). Whiting also founded the National League of Handicraft Societies in 1907. =Indianapolis Museum of Art= Following his resignation as secretary of the Society of Arts and Crafts, Boston, Whiting officially entered the museum profession in 1912, when he accepted a position as Director of the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis (now the Indianapolis Museum of Art). By this time, he was well known within the American arts community as a vocal supporter of the Arts and Crafts movement. Although Whiting remained in Indianapolis for less than one year, many of his efforts here prefigured the innovative programs he would later institute at the Cleveland Museum of Art, including establishing a training program for museum docents and gearing public education at younger audiences. Whiting was recommended to be Director of the Cleveland Museum of Art, through a personal connection, Lockwood de Forest, brother to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's President, Robert W. DeForest.Bruce Robertson, \\"Frederic A. Whiting: Founding the Museum with Art and Craft,\\" in Object Lessons: Cleveland Creates an Art Museum, ed. Evan H. Turner (Cleveland: The Cleveland Museum of Art, 1991), 35. =Cleveland Museum of Art= Cleveland Museum of Art under construction The earliest years of the Cleveland Museum of Art (known colloquially as \\"CMA\\") involved a very intimate group of people, mostly executors named by the wills of Horace Kelley and John Huntington. Having garnered both favor and respect among his colleagues while serving as Secretary of the Society of Arts and Crafts, Boston and as Director in Indianapolis, Whiting was positioned as a leading candidate for the directorship of the newly established Cleveland Museum of Art.Bruce Robertson, \\"Frederic A. Whiting: Founding the Museum with Art and Craft,\\" in Object Lessons: Cleveland Creates an Art Museum, ed. Evan H. Turner (Cleveland: The Cleveland Museum of Art, 1991), 37. Dictionary of Art Historians, \\"Whiting, Frederic Allen,\\" Art History Webmasters Association (AHWA), accessed September 5, 2015, http://arthistorians.info/whitingf. At a meeting on December 15, 1913, after serving only a few short months as the president of the Board of Trustees to the CMA, the board hired its first salaried staff member, unanimously appointing Whiting as the museum's first director. With Whiting's position secured, the museum could solidify its goals and mission. Twelve members of the Board of Trustees were acknowledged in the first museum bulletin, issued in April 1914. By July of the same year, this number had already begun to swell in order to accommodate the rapidly growing project.Five officers: President, two Vice Presidents, Treasurer, Secretary, seven other trustees, and the director. The Cleveland Museum of Art, The Bulletin of the Cleveland Museum of Art, vol 1 (Cleveland: Cleveland Museum of Art, 1914). Frederic Allen Whiting opening of the Cleveland Museum of Art Whiting's plans for the Cleveland Museum of Art centered on his life's mission: education.Dictionary of Art Historians, \\"Whiting, Frederic Allen,\\" Art History Webmasters Association (AHWA), accessed September 1, 2015, http://arthistorians.info/whitingf. The collection that developed in the earliest stages of the CMA's founding included art that was considered to be accessible, relevant, and useful to its community. According to Whiting, \\"Cleveland was an industrial town ‚Ä¶ [the museum] should at least reflect that if not somehow promote it.\\"Bruce Robertson, \\"Frederic A. Whiting: Founding the Museum with Art and Craft,\\" in Cleveland Creates an Art Museum (Cleveland: Cleveland Museum of Art, 1991), 38. Its purpose, in the words of the first director, \\"called for immediate, concrete objects.\\"Robertson, \\"Frederic A. Whiting: Founding the Museum with Art and Craft,\\" 35. Reflecting later on these early decisions in collecting and public programing, in an address to the Cleveland Conference for Educational Cooperation on April 20, 1925, Whiting explained how he believed such objects could benefit communities not only in Cleveland, but across the globe: > In considering what meaning should be given to the term \\"education\\" [we > look] at the question from the standpoint of the interest of the community > as a whole. It is of vital importance to the community that the members of > emerging generations should be properly oriented with respect to the society > of which they become a part, with respect to the natural environment in > which they find themselves, with respect to themselves, their abilities and > needs. It is important that these individuals be qualified for productive > life. It is important that they should be enabled to draw personal joy and > satisfaction from the wealth of experience which the life of the community > affords. And finally, it is important that the individual as a result of his > educational experience shall consciously contribute to the general welfare > and betterment of his community.Donald E. Simpson, \\"Cultural Visionary,\\" > Cleveland Art: The Cleveland Museum of Art Members Magazine 52, no. 4 > (Summer 2012): 23. While covering geographically diverse regions, Whiting managed to comprise a museum of mostly objects. In fact, he specifically sought \\"objects of domestic use,\\" as they were materials that the Cleveland people could relate to and appreciate.Robertson, 36. The 1916 inaugural collection had hundreds of vases, bowls, plates, pottery, and other objects which, during this period, were not traditionally found in major museums.The Cleveland Museum of Art, Catalogue of the Inaugural Exhibition June 6-September 20, 1916 (Cleveland: The Cleveland Museum of Art, 1916). Their similarities provided a constant variable that allowed for daily-life comparisons, while their differences in design intrigued the museum goers. It is possible that Whiting sought to acquire such artifacts as he probably saw the obvious element of the handicraft in them. In many ways, the handcrafted vases of antiquity were much like the handmade goods produced in the Arts and Crafts movement. Further insisting on the relevance of the museum to the local community, Whiting also took part in establishing the annual Cleveland May Show for craftsmen and women.The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, \\"Frederic Allen Whiting.\\" In 1914, he brought his idea to the CMA Board of Trustees, recommending the creation of \\"an annual exhibition of Ohio born or trained artists, to be managed by a jury and hanging committee chosen by the exhibiting artists.\\"http://library.clevelandart.org/museum_archives/finding_aids/may_show/fa_mayshow_02_background.php While the museum was initially hesitant to assume responsibility for the time and expenses involved with organizing a local arts show, Whiting convinced the Cleveland Art Association to include works by local Cleveland artists in their Fifth Spring Exhibition, and it was agreed that the event would be hosted by the Cleveland Museum of Art. Impressed with the event's success, the CMA took over the project in 1919 and organized the First Annual Exhibition of Artists, later referred to as \\"The May Show.\\" The May Show continued to be a Cleveland tradition until 1993. During his seventeen-year tenure as Director of the CMA, Whiting established an object-based collection of fine art and artifacts, as well as decorative and industrial arts that directly related to the Cleveland community. He pioneered the CMA's early collections policies, and encouraged the museum to further its collections in Egyptian and Asian art after receiving substantial donations of each in 1914.Bruce Robertson, \\"Frederic A. Whiting: Founding the Museum with Art and Craft,\\" in Object Lessons: Cleveland Creates an Art Museum, ed. Evan H. Turner (Cleveland: The Cleveland Museum of Art, 1991), 38. Whiting oversaw the original construction of the CMA, ensuring that a state-of-the-art facility would house the museum's already growing collections, anticipating concerns for preservation and conservation throughout the building process. He built the museum's framework for staff and volunteer employees, hiring the first curator, registrar, education specialist, superintendent of building and grounds, registrar, and librarian.Evan Turner, \\"Prologue: To 1917,\\" in Object Lessons: Cleveland Creates an Art Museum, ed. Evan H. Turner (Cleveland: The Cleveland Museum of Art, 1991), 4. Additionally, Whiting hired a staff of professional docents to provide tours to visitors, and was the first museum director in the US to allow visitors to draw among the artworks in the galleries.Bruce Robertson, \\"Frederic A. Whiting: Founding the Museum with Art and Craft,\\" in Object Lessons: Cleveland Creates an Art Museum, ed. Evan H. Turner (Cleveland: The Cleveland Museum of Art, 1991), 40. He experimented with new display techniques and educational programming, allowing the whole second floor of the museum to be dedicated to galleries for children. To Whiting's dismay, the CMA Board of Trustees chose to broaden the focus of the museum in order to include the accession of master artworks to become competitive with institutions such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. When offered the position as president of the American Federation of Arts in 1930, he decided to pursue his commitment to education there. =American Federation of Arts= Whiting resigned from his position at the Cleveland Museum of Art in 1930 to become the president of the American Federation of Arts in Washington, DC. Unfortunately, the experience for Whiting was not a good one. In addition, financial problems arose for the organization which ultimately catalyzed his decision to leave.Whiting to Harold T. Clark, December 30, 1949, Clark\\\\Whiting Correspondence, Director Whiting (II), CMA Archives. He retired from the AFA in 1936 at the age of 63. In a letter to Harold Clark, he said of the experience: > The fact is, Harold, that something very essential to my success in any > undertaking died out of me during the disappointing struggle against an > uncooperative board in Washington. My enthusiasm and confidence in the value > of the work I was doing was an essential part of my success and this was > slowly drained out of me. Regardless, in his six years of employment at the AFA, there was a shift in focus as Whiting brought his educational priorities to the institution. He set forth a number of initiatives regarding this topic. Under his wing, the AFA began to publish reference and teaching guides, student workbooks, slides, and films that were distributed to educational programs across the country. Whiting's overall international footprint was established through his collaborative initiatives with the Met to \\"organize circulating exhibitions and to 'bring them to the people.'\\" Finally his work could be directly appreciated by an international crowd. Retirement Frederic and Olive Whiting Whether it was the slow pace of retirement or its financial limitations that ultimately drew Whiting back to the museum field, a few years after his initial retirement, he began searching for opportunities in the museum field. Despite his efforts, he was not successful in regaining the career he had given up.Robertson, Bruce. \\"Frederic A. Whiting: Founding the Museum with Art and Craft.\\" In Cleveland Creates an Art Museum. Whiting applied for the position of Director at the new museums in Sioux City and Colorado Springs, and almost became the Director of the new Delaware Art Museum, Wilmington. See correspondence in the Whiting papers, Archives of American Art, microfilm roll 142. Undeterred, Whiting entertained the idea of establishing a handicraft shop for local artisans' handicrafts in Maine, but ultimately, this idea never came to fruition.Robertson, Bruce. \\"Frederic A. Whiting: Founding the Museum with Art and Craft.\\" In Cleveland Creates an Art Museum. 55. He was, however, able to help found two museums in Orlando, and one in Ogunquit.Bruce Robertson, \\"Frederic A. Whiting: Founding the Museum with Art and Craft,\\" in Object Lessons: Cleveland Creates an Art Museum, ed. Evan H. Turner (Cleveland: The Cleveland Museum of Art, 1991), 56. His past commitments to education and serving the community were exercised in the development of these museums. About the Orlando effort he wrote: \\"It is an expansion of the plan I worked out with Miss Eastman for the use of distant branch libraries as local cultural centers.\\"Robertson citing Whiting to Marie Clark, February 20, 1950, Whiting Papers, Archives of American Art, microfilm roll 142, 173. Legacy Under Whiting's leadership, the Cleveland Museum of art spearheaded innovations in collections policies, display technology, conservation, education and outreach programs, and interdisciplinary collaboration.Bruce Robertson, \\"Frederic A. Whiting: Founding the Museum with Art and Craft,\\" in Object Lessons: Cleveland Creates an Art Museum, ed. Evan H. Turner (Cleveland: The Cleveland Museum of Art, 1991), 38-41. See also: Frederic Allen Whiting, \\"Isolation of Museum Objects for Emphasis,\\" Museum Work: Including the Proceedings of the American Association of Museums 1, no. 3 (Dec. 1918): 85-87. In many ways, Whiting played an important role in setting the standards for what many twenty-first century Americans now hold in regard to their experiences at an art museum. In its earliest days, the astounding relationship between the CMA and the Cleveland community gave cause for other well-established museums to stop and take recognition. Even if only for a while, museums were looking to the Cleveland Museum of Art as a model of success.Bruce Robertson, \\"Frederic A. Whiting: Founding the Museum with Art and Craft,\\" in Object Lessons: Cleveland Creates an Art Museum, ed. Evan H. Turner (Cleveland: The Cleveland Museum of Art, 1991), 33-34. Whiting's public outreach programming helped to establish the principle functions of early American museums as both educational and aesthetic institutions. He was a driving force behind the early twentieth-century push to decentralize the museum as a mundane repository for valuable objects. His conviction of art's primarily educational function, paired with his empathetic approach in relating the museum's collection to the Cleveland public, made art both physically and rationally more accessible to the Cleveland audience with unprecedented success.Albert Ryder, \\"The New Cleveland Museum of Art,\\" The American Magazine of Art 7, no. 10 (Aug. 1916): 392-397. The academic value of museums was further ingrained when, under Whiting's leadership, the Cleveland Museum of Art pioneered and implemented a systematic evaluation of their educational programming, demonstrating an active interest in both public education and the efficacy of the museum's role for visitors.Bruce Robertson, \\"Frederic A. Whiting: Founding the Museum with Art and Craft,\\" in Object Lessons: Cleveland Creates an Art Museum, ed. Evan H. Turner (Cleveland: The Cleveland Museum of Art, 1991), 41. Whiting established a clear place for the celebration of handcrafted materials in museum collections, and in turn, secured their position within the greater hierarchy of art and artifacts. He has left it to modern scholars, however, to establish the distinction between the two (where Whiting ultimately saw none), and to determine and interpret their value in today's world. His acute understanding of art, artists, and their respective positions within the larger context of cultural studies contributed to the conception and development of a state-of-the-art cultural center in which universities, museums, schools of music and design, and other institutions could initiate collaborative and cooperative projects for public education. This project was realized by what is now Cleveland's University Circle.Donald E. Simpson, \\"Cultural Visionary: Frederic A. Whiting, the Cleveland Conference for Educational Cooperation, and the Planning of University Circle,\\" Cleveland Art: The Cleveland Museum of Art Members Magazine (July 2012): 20-23. = Celebrity = Whiting's celebrity status is documented in newspapers from the time, glorifying even the way he wore his glasses. Raymond O'Neil wrote of him: \\"No man who has come to Cleveland in recent years had been half so expert in wearing glasses as Mr. Whiting is.\\"Raymond O'Neil, \\"New Director of Museum Tells Plans,\\" Cleveland Leader (Cleveland, OH), October 26, 1913. Less superficially, the same article went on to \\"compliment\\" him, saying: \\"to Allen Whiting's gray eyes there is a calmness that is almost Egyptian.\\"O'Neil, \\"New Director of Museum Tells Plans.\\" A strange comment to make, however, it does provide the reader with perhaps a bit of surprising information regarding Whiting's disposition. It seems no wonder that some in Cleveland consider Whiting to be a founding father. The ultimate success of Whiting's career resounds in the fact that nearly every institution and publication he originally shaped exists and thrives in some capacity to this day. Though he left Cleveland in 1930, the city harbored no ill will. The Cleveland Museum of Art had been established and would continue to flourish, thanks to the solid foundation he had laid. Whiting's departure for the AFA was simply the 'next step' in his journey to bring to the nation what he had already brought to Cleveland: a solid arts institution that prioritized education initiatives. =Personal life= Olive Elizabeth Cook Whiting Frederic Whiting married Olive Elizabeth Cook (1872-1954), a singer from Boston, Massachusetts, on June 4, 1903. The two were appointed to organize the Division of Applied Arts at the Louisiana Purchase Exhibition of 1904 in St. Louis, and were awarded a gold medal for their participation.Beverly K. Brandt, \\"'Worthy and Carefully Selected': American Arts and Crafts at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, 1904,\\" Archives of American Art Journal 28, no. 1 (1988): 6-9. Frederic and Olive had one son together, Frederic Allen Whiting, Jr., in 1906. When the family moved to Cleveland in 1913, Mrs. Whiting maintained a prominent role in the Cleveland Museum's social activities, and maintained the role of Assistant to the Director for some time. Upon retirement, the couple spent their time between homes in Ogunquit, Maine, and Mount Dora, Florida.

It was formed by a group of landowners and businessmen in the south of Manchester, England, with the purpose of building a new railway line through the city's southern suburbs. After some commercial difficulties, the MSDR line was eventually built by the Midland Railway and opened in 1880. A section of the line became part of the Cheshire Lines Committee and it was later absorbed into British Rail in 1948. The line was closed in the 1960s as part of the Beeching cuts. In the 21st century the line was partially reopened as part of the Manchester Metrolink network, and today forms the South Manchester Line. History Postcard of c.1905 Services from Manchester to the Peak District were possible via the MSDR, as shown by this 1966 ticket from Manchester Central to The mid-19th century was a time of rapid expansion of Britain's railway network and new lines were being planned around major cities such as Manchester. A group of landowners in South Manchester formed the Manchester South District Railway to develop a line through the local area. By creating a new rapid link to the economic centre of Manchester they hoped to attract prosperity to the growing outer districts. Their intended route would run from a planned junction at Cornbrook in central Manchester to Alderley, Cheshire, passing through the southern Lancashire villages of Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Withington and Didsbury, and on into Cheshire through Gatley and Styal. The MSDR company was sanctioned by Act of Parliament on 5 August 1873, but progress on the new line stalled for years. Development of the delayed MSDR line was eventually made possible as a result of the fierce competition between two railway companies on the lucrative long- distance Manchester-London route. The first line between the two cities had been opened in 1840 by the Manchester and Birmingham Railway, and the company was absorbed six years later into the LNWR. The LNWR's competitor, the Midland Railway (MR) sought to capture the profitable Manchester-London market by opening up its own railway line. Its route through the Peak District proved difficult to construct, and lacking its own line into central Manchester, the MR was forced to share the congested Manchester London Road railway station with the LNWR for several years. In 1876, the Midland was served notice on its access to London Road, and faced with eviction, the company was compelled to develop a new route into the city. In its quest for its own independent line into the city, the MR considered an 1864 scheme of the Manchester and Cheadle Railway to build a railway line from Old Trafford to Heaton Mersey, passing through the suburbs of Old Trafford, Hough End and longside the River Mersey via Church of St James, Didsbury to a junction with the Stockport, Timperley and Altrincham Junction Railway. This proposal was eventually aborted, but the Manchester South District Railway's 1873 scheme emerged as a viable plan. To build the line, the Midland tried to set up a joint venture with the Great Northern and the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railways, but disagreements over funding delayed the project. The Midland eventually took the decision to take over the entire MSDR scheme alone. Powers to build the line were transferred to the Manchester & Stockport Railway in 1876, and an Act of Parliament vested the MSDR in a joint railway, the Sheffield and Midland Railway Companies' Committee on 11 August 1877. The Midland was also a partner in another joint railway, the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) which was building its own railway terminus, . A new junction was constructed at Throstle Nest near Cornrook, connecting the new MSDR to the CLC's Liverpool‚ÄìManchester lines; this would enable trains from the MSDR line to run into central Manchester and terminate at Central Station. The Manchester South District Line opened on 1 January 1880. More importantly for the Midland, this development opened up a new long-distance route to the south, and the Midland Railway closed its operation at London Road station on 1 August 1880, moving all its services to Central Station. Initially, trains terminated at a temporary Free Trade Hall Station until the main station opened in July 1880. The new route proved successful, and the Midland ran express trains from Manchester Central to calling at . The Great Northern commenced a passenger express from Manchester Central to in 1899. A British Rail Midland Pullman at Cheadle Heath in 1960 On 1 October 1901 a new line was opened enabling the Midland to run trains along the MSDR via , Hazel Grove, and , and opening a new southern route for its London express trains. By 1910, the Midland was also operating additional services to and . From 1923, the MR was absorbed into the LMS, and after 1948 the line became part of British Rail. In the postwar period, suburban services on the South District Line declined in frequency. In the late 1950s, British Rail introduced the new Blue Pullmans Manchester-London express train which called at . =Closure= When the former LNWR line from became the principal route for London express trains, the South District Line lost its importance; the route and its stations were listed for closure in the Beeching cuts. Passenger services on the Manchester South District Line ceased on 2 January 1967, although it continued to be used for freight trains and as a relief line for passenger express trains until the line was fully closed in 1969. After closure, the suburban stations fell derelict and were eventually demolished. Manchester Central was mothballed and eventually repurposed as an exhibition centre, the G-Mex in 1986. =Metrolink re-opening= The Manchester South District Line lay derelict for several decades. In 1984, Greater Manchester Council and GMPTE announced the Project Light Rail scheme to develop a new light rail/tram system by re-opening a number of disused railway lines in the region, including part of the former MSDR line as far as East Didsbury. The first phase of the Manchester Metrolink system opened in 1992, but conversion of the MSDR line to light rail did not begin until the early 2010s. Tram tracks were laid along the former trackbed, and new trams stops were constructed, mostly at new locations, as the former Midland Railway stations had been demolished. The new Metrolink South Manchester Line opened as far as on 7 July 2011, and the extension to on 23 May 2013.

Product overview Citrix Virtual Apps is application virtualization software that delivers centrally-hosted Windows applications to local devices without the necessity of installing them. It is the flagship product for Citrix and was formerly known under the names WinFrame, MetaFrame, and Presentation Server. Citrix Virtual Apps software uses FlexCast Management Architecture (FMA), a proprietary architecture for Citrix virtualization products. It delivers individual applications, as opposed to entire desktops, to devices. It is also used with Citrix Workspace to deliver apps as part of a complete virtual desktop environment. With Citrix Virtual Apps, Windows applications can be used on devices that typically could not run them, including Macintosh computers, mobile devices, Google Chromebooks, and Linux computers. Conversely, it enables otherwise incompatible apps to run on Windows desktops. Citrix Virtual Apps is accessed on all devices via Citrix Receiver. The software can be delivered from on- premises data centers or public, private, or hybrid clouds. History The precursor to Virtual Apps was called WinFrame, a multi-user operating system based on Windows NT 3.51. Released in 1995, WinFrame was one of the first products distributed by Citrix. At this stage of the product development Citrix Systems licensed the Windows NT 3.51 base operating system from Microsoft. The core development that Citrix delivered was the MultiWin engine. This allowed multiple users to logon and execute applications on a WinFrame server. Citrix was to later license the MultiWin technology to Microsoft, forming the basis of Microsoft's Terminal Services. Repackaged versions of Windows 95, with Citrix WinFrame Client included, were also available from Citrix. MetaFrame superseded WinFrame in 1998. The product was renamed several times: it became MetaFrame XP in 2002, MetaFrame XP Presentation Server in 2003, and then was rebranded as Presentation Server in 2005. Each of these products focused on remote access of applications and server-based computing. In 2008, the product was renamed XenApp. The \\"Xen\\" was taken from the company's acquisition of XenSource in 2007. Between 2010 and 2012, Citrix issued two updates of XenApp. XenApp 6 launched in 2010 and included a new central management console called AppCenter. In 2012, XenApp 6.5 was released and this update included a new feature called Instant App Access, which aimed to reduce application launch time. In 2013, version 7.0 was released. This update combined XenDesktop and XenApp into one application called XenDesktop under the Flex Management Architecture (FMA). Prior to this, all versions of XenApp used the company's Independent Management Architecture (IMA). In 2014, version 7.5 was released as XenApp, separate from XenDesktop, but it was also built on FMA. In 2018, XenApp was rebranded Citrix Virtual Apps.

Self-assembled monolayers on solid substrates  Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are made of a layer of organic molecules which forms naturally as an ordered lattice on the surface of a desired substrate. Their molecules in the lattice have connections chemically at one end (head group), while the other end (end group) creates the exposed surface of the SAM. Many types of SAMs can be formed. For example: thiols form SAMs on gold, silver, copper, or on some compound semiconductors such as InP and GaAs. By changing the tail group of the molecules, different surface properties can be obtained; therefore SAMs can be used to render surfaces hydrophobic or hydrophilic as well as change surface states of semiconductor. With self-assembly, positioning of SAMs is used to define chemical system precisely to find the target location in a molecular-inorganic device. With this characteristic, SAMs is a good candidates for molecular electronic devices such as use SAMs to build electronic devices and maybe the circuits is an intriguing prospect.

These waves are able to then manipulate droplets of liquid and move them together, in order to form a packed assembly. Moreover, the frequency and amplitude of the waves can be modified in order to achieve a more accurate control of the particular behavior of the droplet or cell.F. Xu, T. D. Finley, M. Turkaydin, Y.

Normal approach such as critical dimension- scanning electron microscopy (CD-SEM) to obtain data for pattern quality inspection takes too much time and is also labor-intensive. On the other hand, the optical scatterometer-based metrology is a non-invasive technique and has very high throughput due to its larger spot size. These results in the collection of more statistical data than by using SEM, and that data processing is also automated with the optical technique making it more feasible than traditional CD-SEM.Van Look, L., Rincon Delgadillo, P., Yu-tsung Lee, Pollentier, I., Gronheid, R., Yi Cao, Guanyang Lin, Nealey, P.F. ‚ÄúHigh Throughput Grating Qualification of Directed Self-Assembly Patterns using Optical Metrology.‚Äù Microelectronic Engineering 123 (2014): 175-179.

In a 1072 record concerning the foundation of Michaelbeuern Abbey, Kazelin is described as a \\"Miles\\" (knight, fief, agent) of the patriarch Sieghard of Aquileia. =Monastery at Mosach= In 1084/85 Kazelin gifted to his overlord, the patriarch Frederick of Aquileia, his lands at Mosach (Moggio) with the request that a Benedictine Monastery be built there. By the time the act had been communicated to Aquileia the patriarch was dying or dead (probably in February 1086) but his successor as patriarch, Ulrich of Eppenstein, received and accepted both the gift and the accompanying request. By 1119 the Benedictine monastery had been built, generously endowed with surrounding territories also gifted by Kazelin.Le origini dell'Abbazia di Moggio e i suoi rapporti con l'Abbazia svizzera di San Gallo, atti del convegno internazionale di Moggio 5 December 1992, Deputazione di storia patria per il Friuli, Udine 1994 The abbey church was consecrated by Bishop Andreas of Cividale in 1119. =Monastery at Eberndorf= It was also an endowment by Count Kazelin that provided for the creation of Eberndorf Abbey. In a record dated 1106, by when it is apparent that Kazelin had died, the Patriarch Ulrich confirms that Count Kazelin has bequeathed his entire lands, their rights and appurtenances, to the Aquileia patriarchate, and Ulrich directs that these matters should be recorded in the benefactor's tomb stone. The record also instructs that Kazelin's body should be disinterred from its existing location at G√∂thelich/G√∂sseling, then in the Archdiocese of Salzburg, and transported to the lands at Eberndorf to be buried there in a new, larger Abbey Church of Our Lady, funded and maintained using the bequest. The three lay witnesses to this document were the Counts Werigand and Vogt of Gurk, along with William of Heunburg.

Although he was never canonized by the roman catholic church, he has been venerated by local practitioners even after the reformation. Life According to legend, while on a pilgrimage to the holy land Anders received a vision of a man on a white horse who miraculously transported him home so that he could celebrate Easter with his parishioners. The rider then transported him to shrine of Santiago de Campostella in Spain, and then to the shrine of Saint Olaf in Norway. Upon his return to Slagelse, Anders was able to heal the lame and blind through prayer. Anders was also reportedly a good friend of King Valdemar II, and on one occasion the king is said to have offered him as much land for his parish as he could ride around on a nine-day-old foal in the time it took the king to take a bath. Taking a bath was a tedious and time consuming task at the time, but the king doubted that Anders would be able to ride very far on the foal. Anders took up the kings offer, and he covered enough ground that a squire had to warn the king to finish his bath quickly before he lost too much land. In his haste, Anders dropped a glove near the town of Landsgrav. A spring later emerged from where his glove had fallen which was visited well into the 18th century for its alleged healing properties. After his death in 1205, Anders was buried at Saint Peter's Church.

Queens of Camo features and includes women that refer to themselves as \\"Queens\\" and \\"huntresses\\" from over 40 countries around the globe.

Criticisms  Various anti-hunting and animal-rights activists have been strong critics of the movement, arguing that hunting is an unethical practice. Show director Nicholas Barton, has been quite vocal about how he feels, \\"Hunting is an ethical alternative to conventional large-scale livestock farms, where the majority of the United States get their meat.

The Search as a service framework is intended to provide developers with complex search capabilities for mobile and web development while hiding infrastructure requirements and search algorithm complexities. Azure Search is a recent addition to Microsoft's Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) approach.  History  In 2008 Microsoft released the Azure platform with a cloud based component code-named project Red Dog. The years leading up to 2013 were spent developing the Azure framework within the scope of a Microsoft environment. In 2013 Microsoft issued a general announcement announcing IaaS and detailing new features of Azure, including the new Azure Search.  Azure Search as a Service  Azure Search is an API based service that provides REST APIs via protocols such as OData or integrated libraries such as the .NET SDK. Primarily the service consists of the creation of data indexes and search requests within the index. Data to be searched is uploaded into logical containers called indexes. An interface schema is created as part of the logical index container that provides the API hooks used to return search results with additional features integrated into Azure Search. Azure Search provides two different indexing engines: Microsofts own proprietary natural language processing technology or Apache Lucene analyzers.https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn879793.aspx The Microsoft search engine is ostensibly built on Elasticsearch. = IaaS and PaaS = Azure offers both the platform via web interface (Platform as a Service) and the hardware via virtual servers allocated to Azure accounts for data storage and processing (Infrastructure as a Service). Azure Search resides within the Microsoft IaaS and PaaS suite as a service, I.E. Search as a Service (SaaS). = Features = Queries  A search string can be specified as one of the query parameters to retrieve matching documents. Azure Search supports search strings using simple query syntax. Supported features include logical operators, the suffix operator, and query with Lucene query syntax. (currently in preview) As an example, white+house will search for documents containing both \\"white\\" and \\"house\\". Lucene query syntax provides features similar to simple query syntax for logical operators and wildcard searches while also supporting more complicated functions such as proximity search and fuzzy search,  Language Support  Azure Search currently supports 56 different languages. Each supported language extension is equipped with a text analyzer to account for differing characteristics pertaining to the specific language. Both analyzers backed by Lucene and analyzers backed by Microsofts natural language processing technology are supported. These analyzers provide features such as text segmentation, word normalization, and entity recognition when processing text documents. The list of supported languages can be found in the Microsoft Azure Documentation.  Search Suggestions  Type-ahead queries or auto-complete search bars provide potential search terms while a user types. The suggestions capability is provided as an optional component specified within an index called a suggester construction. The suggester construction provides information about the list of fields to be considered as content sources for suggestions.  Hit Highlighting  The snippet of text in the search results matching the search query can be highlighted by specifying a set of field names as one of the query parameters for hit highlighting.  Faceted Navigation  Faceted Navigation allows users to specify a field to facet in the query parameters passed to Azure Search. Users can drill down or filter search results by using criteria such as categories, prices and brand. There are several parameters providing customization of faceting capabilities such as sort and intervals. For example, if you specify facet=rating, sort:-value The returning results will contains all groups with a rating in descending order by value. Faceted navigation is common in most e-commerce sites such as Amazon.  Geo-spatial Support  Azure Search supports geo-spatial information. This allows users to explore data based on a specified geographic location. An overview of Geo-spatial support can be found in Azure Search and Geo-spatial Data.

Born around 1830 in Koshare, a village in-between Shtime and Ferizaj in Kosovo. He was recruited around 1860 in the Ottoman army where he served for 5 years. After his service and due to graduated merits, he was sent to a formation of reserves which were obliged to respond if needed. He served 2 years in Istanbul. About 1867 he returned home, got married and created a family. Ottoman Army In 1876, together with other Albanians who were called to serve in Istanbul for Osman Pasha, he was ordered to the front in Bulgaria, Plevne, where a battle had developed, turning it to one of the most fierce battles in Europe at that time. He led a battery of men granted to him by Osman Pasha. During the fierce fighting against the Russians, Bulgarians, Moldovans, and Romanians at the battle of Plevna, Sefe was injured and lost one eye. After that he was nicknamed Sefe Qorri meaning \\"Sefe the blind\\". After the fighting, he was granted passage home in Koshare, close to Ferizaj is modern day Kosovo. As a veteran of war, Sefe enjoyed the respect of Osman Pasha who had used Sefe's courage as an inspiring figure. Battle of Slivova Sefe fought alongside Mic Sokoli, Sulejman Vokshi, Smajl Hyseni, Ali Bira, Januz Qupi and others fighters from the League of Prizren. While serving in the Turkish army, he was a gunner and had managed to seize Turkish cannons which he had placed in front of the village on the hill of Kosher. Along with several other gunners Sefe build two catapults which hit Dervish Pashas army from behind, enabling fighters like Mic Sokoli to penetrate the batteries of the cannons. After Mic Sokoli sacrificed himself by pressing his body towards a Turkish cannon, Sefe Qorri was seriously wounded in the leg and in one hand. He was captured alive by the Turks and a military trial quickly sentenced him to death by hanging. The Turks warned Sefes family that there would be consequences if they tried to take his body down before 7 days. After his hanging, 3 days later, his nephews Aslan, Shaban, and Emin Hysiqi released the rope and buried his body in a secret location. Afterwards they contacted their uncles and showed them where they had buried him. He was given the title of Sefe Kosova for his bravery during his lifetime. Hero Sefe Qorri is remembered today as an Albanian National Hero.

Shope Robert Ellis Shope (February 21, 1929 ‚Äì January 19, 2004) was an American virologist, epidemiologist and public health expert, particularly known for his work on arthropod-borne viruses and emerging infectious diseases. He discovered more novel viruses than any person previously, including members of the Arenavirus, Hantavirus, Lyssavirus and Orbivirus genera of RNA viruses. He researched significant human diseases, including dengue, Lassa fever, Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, viral hemorrhagic fevers and Lyme disease. He had an encyclopedic knowledge of viruses, and curated a global reference collection of over 5,000 viral strains. He was the lead author of a groundbreaking report on the threat posed by emerging infectious diseases, and also advised on climate change and bioterrorism. Biography Born in 1929 in Princeton, New Jersey, Shope was the son of Richard E. Shope, also a prominent virologist. His brothers, Richard E. Shope, Jr and Thomas C. Shope, were also virologists. Shope attended Cornell University, where he gained a BA in zoology (1951) and an MD (1954). After an internship at Yale School of Medicine, Shope joined the U.S. Army Medical Corps and served for a total of three years at Camp Detrick in Frederick, Maryland and then at the U.S. Army Medical Research Unit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. He subsequently joined the Rockefeller Foundation and ‚Äì after a year studying with Max Theiler in New York ‚Äì he was posted to Bel√©m, Brazil, at the foundation's International Virus Program, where he spent six years, rising to direct the institute. Returning to the US in 1965, Shope joined the recently established Yale Arbovirus Research Unit (YARU) at Yale School of Medicine with other virologists from the Rockefeller Foundation. Initially an associate professor, he rose to direct the unit for 24 years. Shope also headed the university's Division of Infectious Disease Epidemiology. After his retirement from Yale in 1995, Shope and his colleague Robert B. Tesh moved to the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Texas, where they founded a new arbovirus centre. Shope subsequently held the university's John S. Dunn Distinguished Chair in Biodefense. Research Transmission electron micrograph showing dengue virions, one of many arboviruses Shope researched The virologist Charles H. Calisher described Shope as a \\"walking encyclopaedia on the arbovirus catalogue,\\" and during his career Shope contributed to the discovery of hundreds of novel viruses ‚Äì more than any person previously. His research encompassed not only the areas of virology, tropical and emerging infectious diseases, but also epidemiology, vector biology and public health. Calisher and emerging infectious disease specialist C. J. Peters highlighted his multidisciplinary approach, stating that \\"He brought the virus community together and served as a bridge between classical arbovirology and many other disciplines\\" including ecology, genetics and structural biology. Epidemiologist and emerging infectious disease specialist Stephen S. Morse considered Shope to exemplify the approach of \\"integrating the laboratory and the epidemiological and being able to think broadly about the evolutionary issues as well as the specifics.\\" Shope initially studied the Australian disease then known as \\"epidemic polyarthritis\\" with S. G. Anderson, showing that it was caused by an alphavirus, later characterised as Ross River virus. His interest in infectious diseases was stimulated by his military service in Malaysia, where he investigated fevers among army personnel and locals. During his time in Brazil in the early 1960s, he characterised over fifty different arboviruses (viruses transmitted by arthropods) including Guama and Oropouche viruses, many previously unknown. He also studied the viruses' vertebrate reservoirs, including birds, marsupials and rodents. Later that decade while at YARU, he characterised novel arboviruses from birds in Egypt. In 1969, his research turned to outbreaks of Lassa and yellow fever in Nigeria. The following year, with Frederick A. Murphy, he discovered Duvenhage, Lagos bat and Mokola viruses, which were the first viruses shown to be related to rabies. He characterised Thottapalayam virus, later shown to be the first hantavirus, from an Indian shrew in 1971. With Murphy and others, he discovered multiple viruses related to bluetongue, including bluetongue 20 virus, the first bluetongue-like virus from Australia. In the late 1970s, with Jim Meegan, he showed that Rift Valley fever virus ‚Äì previously believed to be restricted to sub-Saharan Africa, and mainly to infect livestock ‚Äì was the cause of an epidemic in Egypt in which around 200,000 people were infected. With Allan Steer, he was the first to describe Lyme disease, a tick-borne bacterial disease, in the US. He subsequently worked on viral hemorrhagic fevers, discovering Sabi√° and Guanarito viruses, the causative agents of Brazilian and Venezuelan hemorrhagic fevers. He also researched dengue and its vaccines. During Shope's time at Yale, YARU became the global repository for arboviruses. When he and Tesh moved to University of Texas Medical Branch in 1995, they brought the arbovirus collection ‚Äì consisting of more than 4,000 strains of arbovirus and more than 1,000 other viral strains, as well as reagents such as antibodies ‚Äì with them. The collection is used by scientists internationally to identify virus strains. At Galveston, Shope widened his focus to include bioterrorism, winning $3.7 million in funding to develop measures to counter the threat. His group identified alphavirus, arenavirus and flavivirus as potential bioterrorist risks, and Shope worked with structural biologist David Gorenstein to develop new small-molecule antivirals targeted against these viruses. Public health and advisory work Shope led a high-profile investigation, with Joshua Lederberg and Stanley Oaks, into the risks posed by emerging infectious diseases and the measures necessary to respond to them for the Institute of Medicine. The findings were published in 1992 as Emerging Infections: Microbial Threats to Health in the United States, with Shope as the principal author, and the publication was swiftly recognised as groundbreaking. It suggested that the success of vaccines and antibiotics had led to the threat of infectious diseases being underestimated. Shope stated at the press conference announcing the report's publication: \\"The medical community and society at large have tended to view acute infectious diseases as a problem of the past. But that assumption is wrong. We claimed victory too soon.\\" The report was important in improving the detection of infectious diseases in the US, and has been credited with stimulating renewed global interest in the area. Shope continued to advise the US government on the topic later in the 1990s, and contributed to the establishment of American and international surveillance programs for infectious diseases including ProMED. Shope was one of seven scientists to brief Bill Clinton and Al Gore in 1997 on the effects of climate change, warning that the range of mosquitoes and other arthropod vectors would increase, affecting the prevalence of dengue, malaria and other infectious diseases. He also served on the WHO Expert Panel on Virus Diseases and the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, as well as numerous committees and expert panels for US national bodies including the Institute of Medicine, National Institutes of Health and National Research Council. He was one of the co-editors of Fields Virology, the \\"definitive\\" virology text. Personal life Shope was married to Virginia; the couple had two sons (Peter and Steven) and two daughters (Deborah and Bonnie). He had idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, for which he received a lung transplant in December 2003. He died the following month in Galveston, from complications from the operation, at the age of 74. Societies, awards and honours Shope served as president of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) in 1980. He was awarded the society's Bailey K. Ashford Medal (1974), Richard M. Taylor Award (1987) and Walter Reed Medal (1993). In 2005, ASTMH established the Robert E. Shope International Fellowship in Infectious Diseases in his memory. The University of Texas Medical Branch named its biosafety level 4 laboratory, completed just before his death, The Robert E. Shope, M.D. Laboratory, and also set up a fellowship in his memory. A symposium was held in his honour on March 18‚Äì21, 2004.

In the Netherlands, there are 3.6 million people who care for another. Around 1.1 million caregivers provide more than 8 hours per week and for more than three months for another. 450 000 carers feel burdened or overburdened.Mantelzorg uit de doeken, Sociaal en Cultureel Planbureau, 2010.

By 1953 Union was the leading Hong Kong Insurance company, with assets of ¬£14.4m, over five times that of the nearest local rival, Canton Insurance. In 1967 the Union was acquired by the Guardian Assurance Company which was itself acquired by Axa in 1999. Notable employees and directors of the Union included William Keswick, William Shenton, Arthur William Hughes, A. O. Lang, Stanley Hudson Dodwell, Percy Hobson Holyoak and John Owen Hughes.  History  The Union was founded in 1835 by Dent & Co to provide insurance for commercial cargoes in Canton following expiry of the East India Company monopoly over trade. Original subscribers are believed to have also included Jardine, Matheson & Co., Turner & Co. and Russell & Co. although early records did not survive the collapse of Dent in 1866. When the ports of Hong Kong opened in 1841, the Union moved its business operations from Macau to become the first insurer to be headquartered in the new colony. Until 1874 the company operated under a succession of limited terms of up to three years, each followed by a liquidation of assets to its members, a practice routed in its origins as a mutual assurance society. The leadership of Nathaniel J. Ede as Secretary from 1871 to 1897 had a far reaching impact on the development of the Union. N. J. Ede led the introduction of new articles in 1873 which abandoned the requirement for a limited life and also its subsequent re-registration as a limited liability company under the Hong Kong Corporation Act of 1865‚Äì1881. Chalkley comments \\"The change from a short-term society of partners to a permanent corporation denoted not merely a change in legal form, it also betokened a change in the style of management.\\" \\" We see in the society an early example of the \\"managerial revolution\\" which was to affect corporate establishments from that time to the present day. A merchant's mutual had become a corporation with a life of its own.\\" The changes to the Society between 1873 and its re- registration in 1882 are an early example of demutualization. The entity registered on 24 October 1882 remains live with CR No. 0000011 and is one of the oldest limited liability entities in Hong Kong. In its new legal form the Union expanded rapidly. It opened branch offices in London in 1874 and Melbourne in 1883, N.J. Ede's nephew Charles Montague Ede became the general manager of the company in 1908 in succession to W. J. Saunders. Under his leadership, the Union Insurance Society of Canton expanded as a global insurance company, opened up new branches at Tokyo, Hankow, Tientsin, Scurabaya, Bombay, Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane, Perth, Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, Vancouver, Tornto, Buenos Ayres, Cario and Johannesburg and numerous other agencies.The company's assets expanded to $2m in 1892 and $17m in 1914. and over ¬£5m by 1924. The Union acquired China Traders Insurance Co. in 1906, the China Fire Insurance co. in 1916 and the Yangtze Insurance Association in 1925. By 1920 the Union was the largest marine insurance company in the world. The Union's former headquarters \\"Union House\\" occupied the site of the present day Chater House in Hong Kong. Notable employees and directors of the Union included William Keswick, William Shenton, Arthur William Hughes, A. O.

Robinson in 1918. They were a mixed traffic class. All three examples were withdrawn in November and December 1947. Design The first member of the class (No. 416) was built 1918, in the middle of a batch of GCR Class 8A 2-8-0 locomotives and the design had an identical boiler, cylinders and motion to this class. For three years this remained the only example of the class, but in 1921 Robinson built two further examples, with the intention of comparing their performance with his four-cylinder GCR Class 9P design and later decided to produce more of the 9Ps. The 8N was intended as an improved version of the 1A (LNER B8 class) of 1913, which had large inside cylinders and relatively small axleboxes on the driving axles. Although 8N was an improvement of the 1A design, .The 9P design of 1917 had four cylinders, resulting in a more balanced locomotive with smaller cylinders. Allocation and work Although very competent locomotives, the three examples of this class were non-standard and used on a variety of secondary freight and passenger duties over the former Great Central Railway system. They were eventually replaced in 1947 by members of the B1 class. No examples survived.

It is worn inside the vagina during menstruation to catch menstrual fluid (blood). About every 4‚Äì12 hours (depending on the amount of flow), the menstruating woman removes the Silky cup from her vagina, empties the collected menstrual blood into a toilet or sink, washes the cup under running water and inserts it again. At the end of the monthly period, the cup can be sterilized, usually by boiling in water. Unlike tampons and pads, the cup collects menstrual fluid rather than absorbing it. Silky Cup is the Indian market leader in the reusable menstrual cup market and largest menstrual cup manufacturer in India. Silky Cup has biggest manufacturing production line of the menstrual cup in India.India.http://www.silkycup.com/aboutus-1  Safety, Quality and Standards  The Silky Cup is \\"Clinically Tested\\" within International standards. ISO 10993 is a Quality Standard governed by the International Organization of Standardization in Geneva, Switzerland, and is recognized and practiced in over 160 countries around the world. ISO 10993 is the quality standard for medical devices. Silky Cup is safe; Silky Cup is developed especially for menstrual hygiene management. Silky Cup has been tested as per United States pharmacopeia (USP) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) International standards. Silky Cup has passed the all necessary ISO 10993 tests with great success. ‚ÄúSilky Cup is tested according to ISO 10993-5 (Cytotoxicity), ISO 10993-10 (Mucosal Irritation), ISO 10993-10 (Sensitization), Directive 2011/65/EU Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (ROHS), USP <88> ‚ÄúCLASS VI‚Äù Tests Acute Systemic Injection, Intracutaneous Injection and Implantation.  Objectives  In many countries across the world, menstruation can be a problem, as women and girls may have no access to hygiene products, or simply cannot afford them. These women often experience exclusion from society, and school, college or work can be disrupted or restricted due to lack of available solutions. Investigative studies identify one of the main causes of early school leaving as the lack of hygiene products available for menstruating women and girls. As a result, menstruation has a direct economic and educational impact. Silky cups are a solution that can help girls and women to be integrated back into their social lives. Silky Cup is a product and a social strategy that offers women in developing countries a lifelong solution and support.

He is best known for commanding a mixed force of approximately 600 (some sources say 1750) regulars, Loyalists, and Indians in a raid into upstate New York on October 24, 1781 that culminated in the Battle of Johnstown, one of the last battles in the northern theater of the American Revolution. After the war, Ross was instrumental in settling Loyalist refugees in what is now the Kingston area of eastern Ontario. Early career and the French and Indian War Ross was born in Scotland in 1744. He was commissioned lieutenant in the 34th Regiment of Foot in July, 1762, and was present for the capture of Havana that year and then went on to garrison West Florida. In 1764, following the conclusion of the French and Indian War he was sent to the Illinois Country as an emissary to the French Commander at Fort de Chartres. On this trip he mapped the Mississippi Valley from New Orleans to de Chartres. He was promoted to captain in March, 1772. American Revolutionary War In 1780 Ross was given the temporary rank of major to organize the second battalion of the King's Royal Regiment of New York (Royal Yorkers) at Lachine, Quebec. Later that year the second battalion was sent to occupy and fortify Carleton Island in New York's Thousand Islands. In October 1781 Ross led a force of troops from his garrison and from Fort Niagara in a raid on the Mohawk Valley by way of Oswego and Oneida Lake. The American forces repelled the British; during the retreat the famed commander of Butler's Rangers, Walter Butler, was killed. On his return to Carleton Island Ross built Fort Haldimand. In 1782 he led a force which occupied Oswego and rebuilt Fort Ontario. Cataraqui settlement In 1783 Ross, was assigned to Cataraqui, now Kingston, Ontario to arrange the resettlement of Loyalist refugees in the Cataraqui area. To help with this assignment Ross brought with him 25 officers and 422 men, most of whom belonged to the Royal Yorkers.The Yorker Courant, Issue 2010-1. pg 4 Retrieved February 22, 2016 He rebuilt and repaired the old French fort (Fort Frontenac) to enable the establishment of a garrison, built grist and saw mills, established a navy yard, and assisted with the allotment of land and supplies. Ross also recommended that the land on which the Loyalists were settling should be purchased from the Mississaugas. Since local concerns were administered by the military, Ross was appointed Justice of the Peace in 1784 to better enable him to deal with civilian problems among the settlers. Because of Ross's significance in establishing the Cataraqui settlement, It has been said that \\"He, rather than Michael Grass ... should be called the 'founder of Kingston.'\\" Later years It is believed he married a sister of Captain John McDonell of Butler‚Äôs Rangers. In 1785 Ross returned to England to care for his aged father. He was promoted major in the 34th Foot on May 20, 1785. He returned to Canada in 1786 and was arrested based on accusations by his second in command at Cataraqui. Ross was exonerated and put in command of the 34th Foot in Montreal in August, 1786. The regiment returned to England in 1787. Ross retired from the army in 1789 and sold his commission. He re-entered service during the Napoleonic wars and at some point was promoted to lieutenant-colonel. Ross transferred to the Coldstream Guards and was killed at the Battle of Talavera in Spain in July 1809 during the Peninsular War. References ;Notes ;Bibliography * Mika, Nick and Helma et al.

He served as Minister of Culture in the Cabinet of Tihomir Ore≈°koviƒá from 22 January to 19 October 2016. Hasanbegoviƒá is also a member of the Zagreb Assembly and one of the founders of the Independents for Croatia party. As a historian, Hasanbegoviƒá's interests are relations between the modern Croatian ideologies, especially prava≈°tvo (Croatian nationalist ideology) and its relations towards Islam in Croatia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 19th and 20th centuries. He researches Muslim elements of the Croatian bourgeois culture until 1945 and relations of political parties as well as religious and national relations in Bosnia and Herzegovina since the Austrian-Hungarian occupation until the communist takeover. He was an associate of the Institute of Humanities Ivo Pilar. Since 2019, he is the president of the Bloc for Croatia political party. Early life and education Zlatko Hasanbegoviƒá was born on 14 June 1973 in Zagreb to Bosniak parents Zumreta Hasanbegoviƒá (n√©e Prohiƒá) from Graƒçanica and Ibrahim Hasanbegoviƒá from Bosanska Gradi≈°ka. His mother's side of the family moved from Graƒçanica (modern day Bosnia and Herzegovina) to the Croatian capital of Zagreb in 1941. His maternal grandfather, Sabrija Prohiƒá, was a rich industrialist with properties across the former Kingdom of Yugoslavia. During World War II, the Prohiƒá family helped hide a Jewish girl from Graƒçanica in their house in Zagreb. Hasanbegoviƒá's grandparents Sabrija and Safeta Prohiƒá, along with his aunt and uncle Esma and Avdo Prohiƒá, were posthumously named \\"Righteous among the Nations\\" by Israel in 2018. Hasanbegoviƒá was forbidden from attending the award ceremony.https://www.total-croatia-news.com/politics/28294-israeli- embassy-and-jewish-community-rescind-invitation-to-hasanbegovic After the war, they were accused for smuggling foreign currency and arrested by the Communists. Sabrija Prohiƒá tried to escape to Argentina, but was caught and later killed as a \\"class enemy\\", while their entire property was confiscated. In 1998 he took part in Fascist demonstrations.https://medium.com/@balkaninsight/croatian-minister- joined-1990s-fascist-backed-protests-d39cd1b6f9be Hasanbegoviƒá finished elementary and high school in Zagreb, after which he enrolled in Zagreb Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences where he graduated in history. He gained his doctorate on the same Faculty in 2009 in the field of history under the supervision of Ivo Goldstein. Career Hasanbegoviƒá is working as a research associate at the Ivo Pilar Institute of Social Sciences. He is the editor of Pilar journal, member of executive committee of the Majlis of Zagreb's Muslim community, He is president of the Supervisory Board of the Honorary Bleiburg Platoon, an organisation which is the main organizer of the commemoration for Bleiburg repatriations, and associate of various initiatives for the determination of victims of communist terror. The subject of his interest is the relation of modern Croatian national ideology, in particular the Party of Rights and its present-day offshoots, Islam in Croatia and Islam in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the 19th and 20th centuries. Hasanbegoviƒá researched the Muslim component of Croatian bourgeois culture until 1945 and the political and religious-ethnic relations in Bosnia and Herzegovina since the 1878 Austro-Hungarian rule until the communist takeover in the 1940s. Hasanbegoviƒá has published Croatian translations of several essays: Against Democracy and Equality: The European New Right by Tomislav Suniƒá, The Holocaust Industry by Norman Finkelstein, Intellectual Terrorism by Jure Vujiƒá, Communism and Nazism by Alain de Benoist, and Wahhabism by Hamid Algar. He entered politics in his youth when he was a member of the Croatian Pure Party of Rights (HƒåSP). In 2015 he joined the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). On 8 May 2015 during the \\"Otvoreno\\" show on Croatian Radiotelevision Hasanbegoviƒá stated that anti-fascism is not in the foundations of the Croatian Constitution; \\"Croatian War of Independence is the only war in the 20th century from which Croats came out as true winners and the only basis on which Croatia should be built. Ghosts and goblins of the past will cause a permanent rift and endless debate. Anti-fascism is not the foundation of Croatia, but a platitude that has no basis in the constitutional text, not being mentioned anywhere.\\" Deputy Parliament Speaker and professor of constitutional law Robert Podolnjak from the governing Bridge of Independent Lists party, among many others, posited that anti-fascism is founded in the Croatian Constitution. Hasanbegoviƒá said that his remarks about anti-fascism were related to the Yugoslav totalitarian legacy and Titoism: \\"All who abuse the notion of anti-fascism, which can be fluid, as is well-known to historians, know that various meanings can be attributed to that notion. Stalin, Tito, Pol Pot and also U.S. General Patton were anti-fascists. Everyone knows that those were different persons. We are not talking about abstract anti-fascism but about the particular Yugoslav Communist totalitarian legacy.\\" His political positions have been described in media as right wing or far-right. =Culture Minister= On 22 January 2016, Hasanbegoviƒá was appointed as Minister of Culture by Prime Minister Tihomir Ore≈°koviƒá. A part of the cultural workers expressed their dissatisfaction mainly due to his comments about anti-fascism and his lack of experience in management of culture. Civic initiative Platform 112, which brings together 70 NGOs, held a protest in front of the Parliament on the day when the new Government was approved, urging MPs to vote against the Cabinet of Tihomir Ore≈°koviƒá because of Hasanbegoviƒá. The Croatian Journalists' Association issued a statement in which they strongly opposed the nomination of Hasanbegovic as Minister of Culture. The Israel-based Simon Wiesenthal Center urged the Croatian government to dismiss Hasanbegoviƒá, saying he took a disdainful attitude towards Croatian resistance to fascism during World War Two. The Croatian Helsinki Committee (HHO) and the Initiative EU 1481 of Matica hrvatska dismissed the accusations against Hasanbegoviƒá as unfounded. Hasanbegoviƒá stated that the protests against him were not supported by any facts but based on a selective use of his different statements. During this period a video from 2012 appeared in which he openly refers to the ousting of the Nazi Independent State of Croatia, NDH, as the \\"biggest national tragedy and defeat\\" for Croatia.https://balkaninsight.com/2016/02/24/croatian-government- burdened-by-culture-minister-hasanbegovic-02-24-2016/ Hasanbegoviƒá said about the video that he would not apologize for his words. As one of his first moves as minister, Hasanbegoviƒá announced that there is no need for the continuation of government funding of any non-profit media. The International and European Federations of Journalists joined their affiliates in Croatia, the HND and the Trade Union of Croatian Journalists (Sinoh) in condemning this decision, as well as the Hasanbegoviƒá's dissolution of the Expert Committee for non-profit media before the end of its mandate. Under the new budget for 2016, the Croatian government stopped funding certain cultural projects and non-profit media, which Hasanbegoviƒá described as \\"racket money\\", adding that tax-payers' money will no longer be distributed in a non-transparent way for neither the left-wing nor right-wing media. In May, he signed a cooperation deal with Hungary's Minister Zolt√°n Balog. At the 17th electoral convention of the HDZ, Hasanbegoviƒá was elected to the HDZ Presidency and received most votes. After Croatian Parliament supported motion of no confidence against Prime Minister Ore≈°koviƒá, his whole Cabinet resigned while the Parliament dismissed itself which led to new election. On 2016 parliamentary election, Hasanbegoviƒá was elected to the Parliament as HDZ's candidate. In the aftermath, newly elected president of HDZ Andrej Plenkoviƒá formed a new government with new culture minister being Nina Obuljen Kor≈æinek and not Hasanbegoviƒá for which he expressed his dissatisfaction. =Later political career= In May 2017, Hasanbegoviƒá decided to participate in the Zagreb local elections on the independent list of Bruna Esih, who ran against the official HDZ candidate. Hasanbegoviƒá also criticized the HDZ leader Andrej Plenkoviƒá, saying that his path \\"is wrong and leads to moral quagmire\\". The HDZ soon announced that Hasanbegoviƒá was evicted from the party. The independent list won 8,23% of the vote in the local election and Hasanbegoviƒá became a member of the Zagreb Assembly. Following the elections, Hasanbegoviƒá and Esih formed a new political party, the Independents for Croatia. The new party formed a majority in the assembly with the incumbent mayor Milan Bandiƒá, on condition that the name of Zagreb‚Äôs Marshal Tito Square was changed to Republic of Croatia Square. In 2019, following a split with Esih, he became the president of the newly founded Bloc for Croatia political party. =Controversy= In 1996, Hasanbegoviƒá wrote at least two articles in the magazine \\"The Independent State of Croatia\\", named after the fascist Independent State of Croatia (NDH), in which he glorified the Ustashe as heroes and martyrs. The magazine was edited by the far-right Croatian Liberation Movement (HOP) and Hasanbegoviƒá was described as a young HOP member in it. Commenting on his texts from 1996 twenty years later, Hasanbegoviƒá said that the crimes of the Ustashe were \\"the biggest moral lapse\\" of the Croatian people in their history, adding: \\"Using totally peripheral statements I made as a student more than 20 years ago and taking them out of context is nothing but political manipulation\\". He also denied that he was ever a member of the Croatian Liberation Movement. In 1993, Hasanbegoviƒá posed for a photo in Split at an event of the 9th Battalion of the Croatian Defence Forces (HOS), the Croatian Party of Rights' paramilitary (1991-1992), wearing a cap with what is allegedly an Ustashe Militia badge.Hockenos, Paul, \\"Croatia‚Äôs Far Right Weaponizes the Past\\", Foreign Policy, 6 May 2016. The photograph's resurfacing in 2016 and its circulation in the Croatian media caused major backlash. Hasanbegoviƒá denied he was wearing an Ustashe cap, claiming the photo had been manipulated and that he wore a black cap of the HOS. A similar or identical cap, with an Ustashe badge, was worn by some members of the 9th HOS Battalion during their gatherings in the 1990s. Publications * Muslims in Zagreb, 1878-1945.

G.L. Long was an engineer who was contracted in 1914 to design a steam-powered electrical light plant. It first distributed energy on March 14, 1915, at 6:00 p.m. The steam engines were replaced by a 75-horsepower, two-cylinder, semi- diesel engine and generating equipment manufactured by Fairbanks-Morse in 1922. A 125-horsepower diesel engine manufactured by Worthington Pump and Machinery Corporation was added in 1936. At that time the plant started to supply power to a newly formed rural electric cooperative that was funded by the Rural Electrification Act of 1936. A Faribanks-Morse 300-horsepower, four- cylinder diesel was added in 1939, and the 75-horsepower and 40-horsepower engines were replaced in 1942 by another 300-horsepower diesel. An addition was added onto the north side of the building the same year. It housed the local fire department and city hall. The facility was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. The plant is a single-story, rectangular building that was built of concrete block manufactured in Renwick. It is a contributing building in the historic district.

Built in the 1870s, the building has been called The Last Tenement, as it is the only building that was not demolished during the West End's redevelopment phase or subsequent construction periods. History Construction of the Causeway Street Elevated, with 42 Lowell Street on the left Located on nine hundred square feet of land to the west of TD Garden, the building was constructed in the 1870s at 42 Lowell Street. During the 1880 Census, four families were recorded as living there, which added up to twenty residents. When originally built, the building was constructed alongside thirty similar brownstones, none of which survive to this day. Over the years, the building was recorded as having upwards of fifty residents, including immigrants from Ireland, China, and Russia. In 1892, the building survived a stove flare up on the second floor, and survived a fire on the first floor in 1905. In 1911, the Causeway Street Elevated was constructed right in front of the building. During the 1950s, the West End was considered blighted, and proposals were drawn up to redevelop the neighborhood. Already, multiple buildings along the row had been demolished, either to put in a road or a parking lot. Multiple stories exist as to why the building was not demolished, including strings being pulled with city officials, or protests by residents of the building. Following the redevelopment of the West End, the building was occupied for some time by an associate of the Angiulo Brothers, which was a leading gang in the North End until the Winter Hill Gang decided to run rackets in the area. Since then, the building has been purchased and redeveloped by a private owner. The City of Boston estimates the property's value at roughly $700,000 as of 2015.

Peggy Carter realizes that Whitney Frost is now the only source of Zero Matter, but is still too injured to get it herself. Instead, she breaks Dottie Underwood out of custody and sends her with Jarvis to one of Calvin Chadwick's campaign events. The event is also cover for a Council meeting, Chadwick having convinced them to see Frost (they usually never speak with outsiders, let alone women). Vernon Masters and Jack Thompson are also at the event; Edwin Jarvis distracts Thompson while Underwood collects a Zero Matter sample from Frost using a device designed by Wilkes.

It was built from 1874 to 1875 in the Gothic Revival style. It is situated on the corner of Burgate and Canterbury Lane, west of Lower Bridge Street, opposite the grounds of Canterbury Cathedral in the centre of the city. It is the only Roman Catholic church in Canterbury, built on the site of a medieval church (demolished in 1870); the old St Mary Magdalen‚Äôs Tower was retained. The church contains relics of Thomas Becket.Canterbury - St Thomas of Canterbury from English Heritage, retrieved 29 January 2016 History St Mary Magdalene chapel, demolished in 1871 to make space for the church =Origin= After the English Reformation, the Catholic community in Canterbury survived through the Hales baronets. Sir Thomas Hales, 2nd Baronet helped Catholics after the 1688 Revolution. They had Masses said for them at their chapel in Hales Place. Masses were said at the chapel until 1923. It was then sold by the Jesuits in 1928. StThomasofCanterbury.com, retrieved 02 September 2020 =Foundation= In 1859, a mission was started in the city. It was founded when a Mary Ann Wood gave 59 Burgate Street, the current presbytery, for the use of a Catholic priest. The land around the house was later purchased for the construction of a church and school. The land included a medieval chapel dedicated to St Mary Magdalene. In 1871, the chapel was demolished, but its tower remains standing. =Construction= St. Thomas of Canterbury church, interior In 1874, building work on the Gothic architecture style church started. It was designed by John Green Hall, a local architect. The design of the church was influenced by E. W. Pugin who died in 1875 and worked at Hales Place in the 1860s. The high altar and Lady Chapel altar were designed by A. E. Purdie. On 13 April 1875, the church was opened. The preaching at the Mass was done by the Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Henry Manning. Significant structural changes to the interior were made in 1962/63. In the current era, a double rose stained-glass window under a Gothic arch is located above the altar. Major modifications to the interior were completed in the 1980s, including the installation of a new octagonal altar of limestone with marble pillars. (The high altar remains in place.) A Baptismal font made in 1865 by George Horan was added in the sanctuary. Beside the sanctuary is the Lady Chapel with pieta, a sculpture of St. Constance and of St George, and an altar donated in 1905. The Martyrs‚Äô Chapel contains the shrine with the relics of St Thomas of Canterbury. According to the church's web site, the \\"pedigree of the relics is well authenticated\\". An extension to the church added in 1963 contains the Canterbury Saints Chapel with a mural, The Canterbury Saints created by Helen Grunwald. The organ loft at the west end contains a two manual and pedal organ, rebuilt in 1990. =Developments= In June 1942, the buildings around church were damaged in The Blitz. In 1953, relics and the Stations of the Cross were donated to the church. They had previously come from Westminster Cathedral. They were donated by Cardinal Bernard Griffin after the Eric Gill stations of the cross were installed in the cathedral. In the early 1960s, when the parish priest was Canon de Laubenque, extensions and reordering were done to the church. The north side of the church was extended with a modern flat-roofed two storeys high, structure. A Martyrs Chapel was built on the south side. It contains the relics of St Thomas of Canterbury. In 1989, the sanctuary was re-ordered. The architect was Richard Fulbrook. In 1997, a mosaic was installed in the north aisle. It depicts St Augustine of Canterbury. =Relics= In the Martyrs Chapel in the church there is a reliquary over the altar. It contains a piece of Becket‚Äôs vestment and a piece of a bone from his body. In the late 19th century, these were given to the church by Mary Hales, of the Hales baronets. The relics came from Gubbio in Umbria, where, since the 1220s, they had been held. In 1953, the Prior of Chevetogne Abbey, called Fr Thomas Becquet, a descendant of family of the martyr, gave a piece of Becket‚Äôs finger to the church. Either side of the reliquary are statues of St John Fisher and St Thomas More. The chapel has a stained glass window showing the martyrdom of St Thomas Becket, St Gregory the Great and St Augustine of Canterbury. There is a reliquary set into the wall to the left of the windows. It contains parts of the Mass vestments of √ìscar Romero, Archbishop of San Salvador. In 1997, these were given to the church. On west wall of the Martyrs' Chapel is a statue of St John Stone.

The series began its broadcast on the E! Television Network in the United States in January 2016, and was E!'s largest launch of a non-spinoff unscripted series in the past three years with 3.2 million viewers for its third episode. In November 2016, Henry released a memoir, Between Two Worlds: Lessons from the Other Side. Skeptical activists and others including John Oliver concerned with Henry's rise in popularity have actively attempted to counter the public perception that what Henry does reflects reality. Numerous critics maintain that Henry's readings are performed using deceptive cold reading and hot reading techniques, and not \\"psychic\\" powers. Susan Gerbic and others also criticize his TV show for targeting people who are grieving and vulnerable, and exploiting them for entertainment. Early life Henry is a native of Hanford, California, a small rural city near Fresno. According to Henry, he noticed that he had clairvoyant abilities when he was ten years old. He gave readings to students and teachers at Hanford's Sierra Pacific High School, from which he graduated on an accelerated academic program. Henry initially aspired to attend college and become a hospice nurse. However, Henry soon was \\"discovered.\\" Before long, he gained a celebrity clientele and a reality TV development deal. Henry began filming his E! television series when he was 19 years old; the show began airing a week after his 20th birthday. Henry reportedly welcomes skepticism about his work: \\"I am content with people asking questions,\\" he told the Fresno Bee. Henry is openly gay.  Career  In November 2015, Henry appeared on Keeping Up with the Kardashians where he gave a reading to one of the Kardashian sisters. Hollywood Medium With Tyler Henry premiered on E! on January 24, 2016. After a successful premiere, E! ordered two additional episodes, making it 10 episodes total. In March 2016, It was announced that E! had ordered a second season of the show. A memoir, Between Two Worlds, was released in 2016. Henry has given readings to many celebrities, such as Nancy Grace, Alan Thicke, retired NBA player John Salley and actors Monica Potter, Amber Rose, Jaleel White, the Kardashians, Carmen Electra, Matt Lauer, Chad Michael Murray, Rick Fox, Megan Fox, Chrissy Metz, Kristin Cavallari, Bobby Brown, Roselyn Sanchez, Tom Arnold, Erika Jayne and many more. Alan Thicke's death several months after his reading with Henry has become the subject of media reports and controversy. In 2016, Henry published a memoir titled Between Two Worlds: Lessons from the Other Side. In February 2018, People printed an article in advance of the third season of Hollywood Medium. The article detailed Henry's claims about his abilities, the development of his \\"powers\\", and his reading with La Toya Jackson set to air in the new season, in which he claimed to contact Michael Jackson. = Death of Alan Thicke = On December 13, 2016, actor Alan Thicke died due to aortic dissection at the age of 69. Several months before his death, Thicke was the subject of a reading done for the Hollywood Medium TV show. Among the many topics discussed by Henry, the concern of possible heart problems was addressed: After Thicke died, this part of his reading was referenced by Henry's fans as evidence that Tyler had actually predicted Thicke's death. Various news outlets reported on this uncritically, some with sensational headlines such as \\"Tyler Henry Eerily Predicts Alan Thicke's Death on Hollywood Medium\\". Skeptical activist Susan Gerbic challenged the claim that this was a successful psychic prediction in a September 15, 2017 Skeptical Inquirer article. In a detailed break-down of the entire reading, Gerbic reports that immediately following the above statements, Thicke joked \\"Thank you Doctor Henry, I'm going to take that to heart.\\" Gerbic reported that this prompted Henry to throw back his head and laugh. Gerbic said \\"I'm mentioning this because it seems so heartless (pun intended) that if Henry REALLY thought that Thicke's heart would give out only a couple months later, he should have been less flippant about it, and actually very stern.\\" Gerbic continued:  Critical analysis  It is the opinion of scientific skeptics that mediumship is a con, and that Henry is no exception. As such, skeptical activists and others concerned with Henry's rise in popularity have actively attempted to counter the public perception that what Henry claims to do reflects reality: * Gerbic, a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, has dismissed Henry as one of many \\"grief vampires\\" who have gained recent cultural notoriety, and she is particularly critical of Henry's stated aspiration of offering counseling to parents who have lost children to suicide, a practice Gerbic describes as \\"prey[ing] on families when they are the most desperate and vulnerable.\\" Gerbic describes the performances as \\"a fabric of lies,\\" saying that people like Henry \\"prey on the poor and disaffected.\\" As of February 2018 she has published seven articles detailing how she believes Henry's feats are actually accomplished. In March 2018, Gerbic published an article on the Skeptical Inquirer website summarizing a number of techniques which she says are used by psychics, such as Henry, to achieve their effects. * Author Sharon Hill of Doubtful News and the 15 Credibility Street podcast, has also been critical of Henry, stating \\"It's hardly a 'skill' to guess at celebrities' lives,\\" noting that his apparent successes on the show are \\"craftily edited\\" for television audiences. * \\"What Henry's doing isn't entertainment\\" states activist Hemant Mehta, \\"it's deception.\\" Mehta doubts that Henry will submit to scientific trials, and feels that he is \\"just the latest telegenic star on a network dedicated to celebrating vapid people.\\" * Neurologist Steven Novella, founder of the New England Skeptical Society and host of The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe podcast, states that psychics like Henry are \\"grief vampires\\" who say they are giving comfort to grieving families: \\"Henry wishes to inject made up BS. He is not a trained counselor, and working with the grieving is very tricky. The potential for harm is tremendous.\\" * Surgical oncologist David Gorski of ScienceBlogs writes in his January 22, 2016, article \\"The rise of a new grief vampire\\" that: :Gorski goes on to say: * Huffington Post entertainment writer Cole Delbyck criticized the show and Henry's claims to connect celebrities with their deceased loved ones, saying, \\"from the previews, it looks fairly exploitative and tasteless.\\" * Mentalist Mark Edward and Gerbic commented on the readings Henry gave to Ross Matthews, Margaret Cho, Jodie Sweetin and Jillian Rose Reed. They state that Henry does not need to know whom he is reading in advance as \\"it appears to be nothing more than lukewarm cold reading, flattery and generalities.\\" The sitters in the post interviews claimed that Henry had been very specific, but Gerbic and Edward could not find one single hit, noting errors in memory for each sitter. In the case of a reading Henry did for a staff editor from Cosmopolitan Magazine and which was released on video by the magazine, Gerbic notes that there might also be evidence of Henry having information ahead of time, thus also doing some hot reading. * Bobby Finger calls Hollywood Medium \\"the worst show on television\\" and a \\"deceptively cruel little experiment in exploitative programming.\\" He analyzed an episode in which Henry met with Carole Radziwill and showed that everything Henry told her was easily accessible public information. He concludes \\"The loss of a loved one causes its own special, terrible category of pain, and to exploit someone's grief in a way that presents the afterlife as this bleak, murky place where our dead friends and family members are constantly on the hunt for people like the Hollywood Medium ... to spread a message that is almost without fail, 'I'm fine,' doesn't just con their desperate, mournful targets out of a few hard-earned dollars, it does a disservice to the memories of those they lost.\\" Susan Gerbic agrees with Finger that \\"this is not innocent fun.\\" She analyzed that same episode and came to an only slightly different conclusion. She states that Henry doesn't need to have advanced knowledge of his sitters \\"because he just needs to throw out general statements and then remain silent while the sitter fills in the details.\\" She looks at the specific time when Radziwill handed Henry a woman's gold ring and Henry states that the ring is a reference to someone who died at an early age, then asked if she knew anyone who fit that. Radziwill said, \\"\\"yeah [pause] a girlfriend [pause] her name is Carolyn.\\" Gerbic points out that \\"These pauses are important to note. This is where Henry is just letting the sitter talk and dropping all the information he is going to need.\\" * In 2016, the Independent Investigations Group awarded Henry's TV show the \\"Truly Terrible Television Award\\", which read: * In a 2016 article \\"The Hollywood Medium has a secret,\\" Ryan Houlihan describes and analyses the Tyler Henry phenomenon from a skeptical perspective. He explains how Tyler uses cold reading, and likely hot reading techniques as well, to give the illusion of psychic powers. Houlihan attributes Henry's success to the gullibility of celebrities as well as the media: \\"Henry's shtick is polished, but it only works because he has such great support. Besides the celebrities he interviews, Henry seems to have the full-throated endorsement of the entertainment press.\\" Houlihan concludes his article with: * In a May 2017 article she wrote for Skeptical Inquirer, Susan Gerbic analyzed in great detail a widely viewed E! Network video of Henry giving a fan, Jamie Horn, a reading. Following the session with Henry, Horn said \\"It was amazing and emotional!\\" But Gerbic's conclusion is that Henry simply used cold reading techniques to deceive her: * In June 2017, Nancy Grace sat for a reading with Henry. Grace was convinced that Henry was communicating with her dead father, as well as her murdered fianc√©, and said she had received closure. After the reading Grace said \\"there were many things [Henry] said were impossible for him to have gleaned on the internet or even a computer search, speeches I've given, of things that have happened, I find it difficult to believe ‚Ä¶ I find many of the things he said to be absolutely amazing.\\" In April 2018, Susan Gerbic analyzed the reading, and detailed in Nancy Grace Should be Ashamed of Herself! exactly how Grace had unfortunately been fooled by the usual fraudulent techniques of cold reading and hot reading used by \\"grief vampires\\" like Henry to convince people that they have paranormal powers. * In April 2018, Ben Fowlkes of MMAJunkie.com reported that during a reading of former UFC Women's Bantamweight Champion Ronda Rousey, Henry conveyed information about her father's suicide, as if obtained through mediumship. However, Fowlkes points out that the \\"revealed\\" information was easily available via a Google search because Rousey had publicly discussed these details on multiple occasions. Doing this is an example of a deception called hot reading. * In a 2019 segment of Last Week Tonight, John Oliver criticized the media for producing shows such as The Hollywood Medium, because they convince viewers that psychic powers are real, and so enable neighborhood psychics to prey on grieving families. Oliver said that Henry may use hot reading in addition to cold reading. As an example, Oliver dissected Henry's reading of Matt Lauer concerning the father-son fishing trip that was part of the reading. Oliver showed examples of publicly available information about Lauer's love of fishing with his father, including Lauer stating this on his own show several times. Oliver summarized \\"Look, maybe Tyler Henry genuinely accessed the afterlife, an action which would fundamentally change our understanding of everything on Earth. Or maybe he just googled ‚ÄòMatt Lauer Dad‚Äô and hit the fucking jackpot‚Äù. Speaking about psychics in general, Oliver said: ‚ÄúAt best, it is reckless for a stranger to take a stab at ventriloquizing the dead. Loss is complicated, and mourning doesn‚Äôt look the same for everyone. But at worst, when psychic abilities are presented as authentic, it emboldens a vast underworld of unscrupulous vultures, more than happy to make money by offering an open line to the afterlife, as well as many other bullshit services.\\" * In a survey of various psychic's social media accounts in June 2020, investigator Susan Gerbic found that not only had Henry not predicted the Covid-19 pandemic but he planned events during that time which had to be cancelled. According to Henry's website, events would be rescheduled for later in 2020 but as Henry was unaware of when restrictions would be lifted, those dates were not yet available. Gerbic responded to all the psychics she reviewed not seeing the pandemic coming, '\\"Oh, so, what good are you then?\\"' Paranormal challenge * In September 2019, the Center for Inquiry's paranormal investigations group, IIG, challenged Henry to demonstrate his psychic abilities. The organization offers $250,000 to anyone that can demonstrate psychic powers under agreed upon scientific conditions, but no one has yet claimed this prize. The organization sent registered letters to Henry and his agent. but as of February of 2020, the CFIIG were yet to receive a reply to their challenge.

The film follows a drug-addled woman in a remote Michigan town who becomes pregnant after taking a strange drug. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2016. The film was released in the United States on September 2, 2016, by IFC Midnight. Plot Lou (Natasha Lyonne) is a hard-partying stoner who lives in a run-down trailer outside a rural Michigan town where women have recently been going missing. She awakens one morning after a party at an abandoned warehouse and finds herself experiencing bizarre symptoms akin to those experienced during pregnancy. Her friend, Sadie (Chlo√´ Sevigny) believes she is pregnant and not telling her about it, despite Lou's claims that she hasn't had sex with anyone in nearly a year. Lou also believes that it is impossible for her to get pregnant after an upsetting incident six months earlier when she miscarried in a club while on the toilet. After getting a ride from her friend Luke (Emmanuel Kabongo) to her cleaning job at a motel, she encounters an eccentric stranger, Lorna (Meg Tilly), who is staying in one of the hotel rooms. Meanwhile, Gabriel (Mark Webber), Sadie's drug dealer and boyfriend, is keeping a woman hidden in his apartment who has had a grotesque physical reaction to a new and strange drug Gabriel and his friend Warren have been selling to locals. It is revealed that Sadie, who had a child many years ago, is working to try to reunite with her estranged offspring, though Gabriel is doubtful it will ever happen. In addition to running drugs (including unstable, experimental drugs, some of which turned an underling's skin inside out upon sampling it), Gabriel works as a pimp; during an encounter between a sex worker and a client, a strange man, apparently familiar to Gabriel and later revealed to be Isaac, watches the intercourse take place, noting his interest in the encounter. One afternoon, Lou loses consciousness and has bizarre hallucinations in which figures from Funzone, a local family entertainment center give her a vaginal exam. She awakens to find her stomach protruding, and a blister formed on her foot, which leaks a clear fluid after she cuts it open with a knife. When Lou regains consciousness, Lorna arrives at her trailer unannounced, and asks her if she's experienced a series of odd symptoms and mental fogginess; she claims to be clairvoyant, and have noticed that Lou seemed troubled when she had met her at the motel. The two have lunch at the Funzone, and Lorna confesses that she was abducted by an unknown entity while enrolled in the military, an event which led to her being discharged when she questioned her authorities. Lou confronts Warren, who works at the Funzone, about the night before she began experiencing her symptoms; he admits that Gabriel has been \\"trading\\" women, mostly runaways, to a mysterious man named Isaac in exchange for drugs to sell. At her trailer, Lorna shows Lou a scar on her forearm, where she claims an implant was inserted and then forcibly removed while she was in the military. Sadie arrives the next day, and suggests Lou see a doctor, but Lou insists she is not experiencing a pregnancy. Lou, Sadie, and Lorna go to visit the abandoned warehouse where the party had occurred the night before her symptoms began. There, she has a flashback of being injected with a drug by Gabriel at the party. Sadie then confesses that Gabriel had used Lou as a test subject for the new drug‚Äîan experimental hormone for women‚Äîthat he has been selling. Back at Lou's trailer, Lorna attempts to give Lou a cesarian section to remove the growth in her stomach. Instead, Lou gives birth to a grotesque, animated disembodied head. Just after the birth, Gabriel and Isaac arrive at the trailer along with another SWAT member who shoots Lorna. Isaac reveals that the military is investigating a way to create a new race that can survive the toxic atmosphere of space (which he has been to several times) and that her lifestyle of hard- drinking and drug use, as well as his secretly pumping toxins into her home, provided an ample womb for their experiment. He tells Lou that she can help him build a new, superior race, but she refuses to continue. As he explains this, arms begin to emerge from her vagina, followed by the whole of her cytoskeleton, leaving her flesh an empty shell. The headless creature attacks and kills both Gabriel and Isaac. A SWAT member enters the trailer after hearing a commotion, and sees the trailer covered in blood, as the full-bodied creature stands in the kitchen, holding its head in its hands.

In designing the feature, Perez sought to work with a female lead, telling Daily Dead \\"narratively and visually I'm more interested in that.\\" He created a script to deliberately \\"subvert a lot of female archetypes\\", specifically subverting the idea of how pregnancy is usually depicted as \\"this image of women as glowing in gestational bliss and being so happy\\". \\"No one really talks about the more gruesome aspects of pregnancy and what it does to the body.\\" In creating the narrative, Perez was also inspired by various conspiracy theory enthusiasts as well as \\"weird UFO YouTube videos\\". From the beginning, Perez wrote the film with Natasha Lyone in mind, whom he was personally friends with, with her officially signing on in May 2014 along with Chlo√´ Sevigny. Release The film had its world premiere at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival on January 25, 2016. Shortly after, IFC Midnight acquired distribution rights to the film. The film was released in a limited release and through video on demand on September 2, 2016. It was also shown at the After Dark Film Festival in Toronto, Canada. The movie premiered on Netflix in the United States on January 30, 2017. =Critical reception= On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 69% based on 32 reviews, and an average rating of 5.3/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Bloody Disgusting gave the film a positive review, calling it \\"good old body horror movie. It's got the suggestion of pregnancy, so you're dealing with the undertones of a woman's mixed feelings about her own capacity to give life, but if you don't want to go there it's really just gross as hell.\\" The Guardian also gave the film a positive review, drawing comparisons to The Big Lebowski and David Cronenberg's The Brood. The New York Times described the film as resembling a \\"meth fever dream.\\" Consequence of Sound gave the film a negative review, saying, \\"There are at least six different movies in Antibirth, and none of them work in tandem.\\" Home media The film was released on Blu-ray and DVD on February 7, 2017 by Scream Factory.

However, systematic identity controls were still in place at the border between most member states. Disagreement between member states led to an impasse on the abolition of border controls within the Community, but in 1985 five of the then ten member states, Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany, signed an agreement on the gradual abolition of common border controls. The agreement was signed on the river-boat Princess Marie-Astrid on the river Moselle near the town of Schengen, Luxembourg, where the territories of France, Germany and Luxembourg meet. Three of the signatories Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands had already abolished common border controls as part of the Benelux Economic Union. The Schengen Agreement was signed independently of the European Union, in part owing to the lack of consensus amongst EU member states over whether or not the EU had the jurisdiction to abolish border controls, and in part because those ready to implement the idea did not wish to wait for others (at this time there was no enhanced co-operation mechanism). The Agreement provided for harmonisation of visa policies, allowing residents in border areas freedom to cross borders away from fixed checkpoints and the replacement of passport checks with visual surveillance of vehicles at reduced speed and vehicle checks that allowed vehicles to cross borders without stopping.Respectively Articles 2, 6 and 7 of the Schengen Agreement, eur- lex.europa.eu; accessed 27 January 2016. In 1990, the Agreement was supplemented by the Schengen Convention which proposed the abolition of internal border controls and a common visa policy. It was this Convention that created the Schengen Area through the complete abolition of border controls between Schengen member states, common rules on visas, and police and judicial cooperation. The Schengen Agreement along with its implementing Convention was implemented in 1995 only for some signatories, but just over two years later during the Amsterdam Intergovernmental Conference, all European Union member states except the United Kingdom and Ireland had signed the Schengen Agreement. It was during those negotiations, which led to the Amsterdam Treaty, that the incorporation of the Schengen acquisThe complete acquis, including the fundamental Agreement and Convention and some subsequent acts and instruments brought about meanwhile in its legal framework, had been published here: . into the main body of European Union law was agreed along with opt-outs for Ireland and the United Kingdom, which were to remain outside of the Schengen Area. sign marks the border between Spain and Portugal In December 1996 two non-EU member states Norway and Iceland signed an association agreement with the signatories of the Schengen Agreement to become part of the Schengen Area. While this agreement never came into force, both countries did become part of the Schengen Area after concluding similar agreements with the EU. The Schengen Convention itself was not open for signature by non-EU member states.Article 140 of the Schengen Convention.

Switzerland's Schengen entry finally complete. swissinfo.ch; retrieved 14 June 2013. Now that the Schengen Agreement is part of the acquis communautaire, the Agreement has, for EU members, lost the status of a treaty, which could only be amended according to its terms. Instead, amendments are made according to the legislative procedure of the EU under EU treaties.At first the Council of the European Union, later the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union in the codecision procedure, took the place of the Executive Committee that had been created under the agreement; Council Decision of 22 December 2004 providing for certain areas covered by Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community to be governed by the procedure laid down in Article 251 of that Treaty Ratification by the former agreement signatory states is not required for altering or repealing some or all of the former Schengen acquis.Example: By article 39 subsection 1 of the Schengen Borders Code, Articles 2 to 8 of the Schengen Agreement had been repealed ‚Äì . Legal acts setting out the conditions for entry into the Schengen Area are now made by majority vote in the legislative bodies of the European Union. New EU member states do not sign the Schengen Agreement as such, instead being bound to implement the Schengen rules as part of the pre- existing body of EU law, which every new entrant is required to accept. This led to the result that non-EU Schengen member states have few formally binding options to influence the shaping and evolution of Schengen rules; their options are effectively reduced to agreeing, or withdrawing from the agreement. However, consultations with affected countries are conducted prior to the adoption of particular new legislation.

Following the death of her husband in 1871Mary MacPherson, DASG.ac.uk, Retrieved 29 January 2016 Mairi Mh√≤r took employment as a domestic servant with the family of an army officer. She was accused of stealing clothes belonging to the officer's wife, who had just died of typhoid, and sentenced to 40 days imprisonment. All court documents relating to the case appear to have been lost and it is unclear exactly what happened. It is often claimed that another servant with a grudge against her planted the stolen clothes in Mairi Mh√≤r's box. She protested her innocence for the rest of her life and was almost universally believed by the Gaelic speaking community. At the time of her trial she was supported by John Murdoch, campaigning journalist and founder of The Highlander. Charles Fraser-Mackintosh, Inverness solicitor and politician, is also said to have acted on her behalf but it is unclear in what capacity. This marks the start of a friendship between the poet and the politician that lasted for the rest of her life. Her brush with the law and the feeling it aroused is recorded in Tha mi sg√¨th de luchd na Beurla (I'm tired of the English speakers).

Here she seems to have learned to read and write in English, and qualified with a nursing certificate and diploma in obstetrics from Glasgow Royal Infirmary. In 1876 she moved to Greenock to work but often returned to Glasgow for c√®ilidhs and other gatherings of Skye people. Both Glasgow and Greenock had sizeable Gaelic-speaking communities at the time. It is thought that she probably sang at many of these ceilidhs as there is evidence of her frequently doing so after she retired to Skye in 1882. By this time she had acquired a reputation for her songs and her championing of the crofters in the increasingly heated debate over land rights.

She is known to have been present at Highland Land League meetings and to have been actively involved with campaigners such as Alexander Mackenzie and her friend Charles Fraser-Mackintosh in the run up to the Napier Commission of 1883-4 and the Crofters Act of 1886.

Qing Empire Beaver was designed for John Jacob Astor by Eckford & Beebe, with working being completed in 1805. The ship sailed to the Qing Empire in 1806 and was captained by Isaac Chauncey. Upon entering the Bocca Tigris the Beaver was detained by HMS Phaeton. One of the sailors was forcibly impressed onto the Phaeton as he was recognised as a British citizen.Chauncey, Issac. \\"To James Madison from Com.

Tensions arose when Chauncey refused to allow any further impressment of his crew. However that evening the Beaver was allowed to depart back to New York City. The voyage was a success and brought Astor a sizable profit. Pacific Northwest Eventually the Beaver was planned as an additional supply ship for Astor's developing Pacific Fur Company (PFC). Along with the Tonquin, the Beaver was a critical part of Astor's plans in expanding operations in the Maritime Fur Trade. The ship sailed from New York City to the Pacific Northwest on 10 October 1811 with Cornelius Sowle as its captain.Ross, Alexander. Adventures of the first settlers on the Oregon or Columbia River. London: Smith, Elder and Co. 1849, pp. 233-235. The additional company employees brought included Ross Cox and Alfred Seton. Fort Astoria was reached on 9 May 1812 after crossing the Columbia Bar. At Astoria news about the destruction of the Tonquin by members of the Tla-o-qui-aht nation was confirmed. After unloading necessary supplies to the Fort, directives from Astor dictated that the Beaver was to then go north to Russian America to purchase additional furs.Greenhow, Robert. The History of Oregon and California and the Other Territories on the North-west Coast of North America. Boston: Charles C. Little and James Brown. 1844, p. 44. The manager of PFC operations, W.

The purchased furs were located at the Russian-American Company station on Saint Paul Island though bad weather prevented them being loaded until November. Additional orders from Astor called for the Beaver to return to the Columbia River after completing trade with the Russians. Despite this, Sowle and Hunt found the ship in poor repair and sailed for the Kingdom of Hawaii instead. Hunt was left there as the Beaver went west to the Qing. While at Guangzhou, Sowle learned of the eruption of the War of 1812 and remained at the port for the remainder of the conflict.

OrdwayCenter Market Ad - The Morning Times, November 3, 1895 At the time of its construction, it was the largest market hall in the country (57,500 square feet)‚Äîlarge enough to supply the rapidly growing urban population of D.C. with fresh groceries. The 9th Street Wing and Arcade were added in 1888 nearly doubling the capacity of the structure. In the process, it also added mechanical refrigeration with 400,000 cubic feet of cold storage rooms for meats using 10 miles of heavy two-inch brine pipes and electric lighting machinery. A very tall chimney stood above the boiler room. The architect unconventionally designed the market building without alleys or driveways for traffic; by doing so, he hoped to encourage customers to stroll leisurely around the market.Goode, James W.

Layout Plan of Center Market in 1924 Center Market showing the front of the building and the 9th Street Wing in 1914 View of the back of the market (on the left) around 1879 The building had three wings connected to one another with a total of 666 stalls: * the 7th Street Wing which ran parallel to 7th Street NW (stalls 1 to 155) * the B Street Wing which ran parallel to B Street NW connecting the 7th Street Wing to the 9th Street Wing (stalls 156 to 511) * the 9th Street Wing which ran parallel to 9th Street NW (stalls 512 to 666) These three winds formed a U.

Another metal awning ran the entire length of B Street NW and 9th Street NW. These protected shoppers visiting the outdoors stalls. For a small fee, street dealers could place their stands outside, under the market canopy. A small park with trees stood between the buildings and Pennsylvania and Louisiana Avenue. From 1880 to 1931, the Rawlins Statue stood in the triangular lot where the two avenues intersect.

Stalls of meats, fish, vegetables, condiments as well as flowers were available to serve them. Cold rooms provided storage of meats and other perishables and all dealers had storage on site for their produces. Good for sale were put on display on stands tiled with white subway tiles for cleanliness. Customers could also use the Cold Storage Department to use the fur room where items such as dressed furs, carpets, rugs and other garments could be stored in order to protect them from moths and other insects that could destroy them. Artesian wells provided fresh pure water for refrigerating purposes as well as the manufacturing of ice. This was extremely important considering houses did not have refrigerators at the time and used ice to preserve food. Outside the building, other vendors sold similar produces but did not have access to the same storage facilities as inside.

Dennis Schwartz's Movie Reviews. October 16, 2013. Retrieved January 29, 2016. Plot 17-year-old Brooklyn high schooler Jackie Kimball lives with her widowed mother, her 18-year-old brother Matthew, and her older sister Jeanne, while her oldest brother is abroad on a student exchange program. Jackie and Matthew have always been extremely close, but their relationship is complicated by her lifelong romantic feelings for him and his lack of reciprocity. Having until now been content with the existing state of affairs, Jackie has no choice but to deal with the disruption of her idyllic childhood world by the harbingers of adulthood. In the spring of 2011, Matthew gets his first girlfriend, Yolanda. When Yolanda visits the Kimballs, Jackie is surprisingly sociable during the dinner, but unbeknownst to the diners, she is unable to eat without vomiting. Later that evening, Jackie confronts Matthew in the attic room that is their traditional meeting place, but he protests that he \\"want[s] to give [Yolanda] a chance.\\" Jackie is notified by a friend through a text message that Matthew unexpectedly broke up with Yolanda. Relieved, Jackie is finally able to enjoy food. Matthew had bought tickets to a concert he was planning to go to with Yolanda but, having broken up with her, invites Jackie instead. She is watchful of any sign that he might become receptive to her overtures, and they discuss her incestuous desire relaxedly, apparently not for the first time. Brother and Sister spend a pleasant summer together, capped by an idyllic evening out at the concert. Jackie's temporary reprieve from her grief wanes along with the summer itself as Matthew's departure for college approaches. Despite keeping up contact via video letters and a host of electronic media, she takes the separation hard, and her concerned mother sends her to psychotherapy. Initially secretive, on one of the visits Jackie finally opens up to her therapist Linda about her attraction to Matthew. Also, with a handsome classmate named Tristan, Jackie has her first sexual experience, of which she does not delay to notify Matthew, and he congratulates her on it. Having no emotional attachment to Tristan, Jackie does not hesitate to alienate him when Matthew returns on vacation. During a late-night one-on-one chat in the attic room, Matthew, initially unswayed by Jackie's overtly sexual questions, snaps and accuses her of going too far. As he is again leaving for college, she is resigned to the fact that he will never reciprocate her feelings. Under Linda's influence, Jackie eventually makes the tough choice of applying to a different college than Matthew. She decides to major in psychology, an interest ignited by her own life experience.

Neil Young reviewing the film for The Hollywood Reporter writes \\"Sensitive subject-matter is handled with tact and intelligence in this tart if talky US indie.\\" According to Dennis Schwartz, \\"An American indie with European sensibilities, it makes for a different sort of coming of age film ‚Äì a highbrow and distinctive one that's worth checking out.\\" Nicolas Rapold of The New York Times wrote, \\"More often than not the emotional bind is not shocking or taboo at its root, and indeed Mr. Sallitt‚Äôs latest, the Brooklyn-set feature The Unspeakable Act, is about the familiar more than it is about the forbidden.\\" Similarly, Drew Hunt of the Chicago Reader warns, \\"This may bore or frustrate some viewers: the appeal of an incest story is the prospect of seeing repressed, taboo desires erupt into explicit sex and ensuing scandal. In The Unspeakable Act, the heart of the drama is not the transgression but the curious lack thereof.\\" Film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum included the film on his list of the ten best films of 2013.The Unspeakable Act at Year-End Lists He later included the film in an afterword to his book Essential Cinema: On the Necessity of Film Canons. Dan Sallitt, the director and screenwriter of the film himself, said in an interview with Filmmaker, \\"I personally don‚Äôt see Jackie‚Äôs incestuous desire as a transitory thing or part of her passage to adulthood. I think it‚Äôs just the way she is, and she will have to keep a lid on that desire in order to live comfortably, will have to cultivate other aspects of herself. By film‚Äôs end, I‚Äôm hoping that the viewer feels that we are all like Jackie, each with some quirk that makes us feel that we are the only abnormal person pretending to fit into an otherwise normal world.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:2012 films Category:2012 drama films Category:2012 independent films Category:2010s coming-of-age drama films Category:2010s psychological drama films Category:2010s romantic drama films Category:2010s teen drama films Category:2010s teen romance films Category:American coming-of-age drama films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American psychological drama films Category:American romantic drama films Category:American teen drama films Category:American teen romance films Category:Coming-of-age romance films Category:English-language films Category:Films about siblings Category:Films set in 2011 Category:Films set in 2012 Category:Films set in Brooklyn Category:Films set in Manhattan Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Incest in film ","title":"The Unspeakable Act"},{"id":"49263267","text":"The Society may refer to: *The Society (Church of England), an independent association of Church of England clergy and lay people *The Society (TV series), a 2019 series on Netflix *The Society (ex Danse Society), a gothic rock band See also *Society (disambiguation) ","title":"The Society"},{"id":"49263273","text":"Antipater () was in ancient Greece a writer on the interpretation of dreams (Oneirocritica), mentioned by fellow writer on dreams Artemidorus in his Oneirocritica.Artemidorus, Oneirocritica. 4.64 His works are now lost, and the only reference to his work is in Artemidorus, who mentions Antipater's thoughts on a dream where the dreamer had sexual intercourse with a piece of iron.

Quotes on Levon Lachikyan  ‚Äò‚ÄôI am immensely impressed by Levon Lachikyan‚Äôs drawings. They are elegant and sensitive works with the sense of space and fine composition. It is of great importance that Levon‚Äôs drawings are not simple reproductions of the substance or mere documentation. Along with presenting the architectural details of various constructions he is able to abstract from them and manifest his individual attitude towards the matter‚Äô‚Äô. Hagop Hagopian, Armenian prominent artist ‚ÄúA lot of people have written about culture and a lot of them will still write. However, I strongly believe that not everyone should write about art and generally culture. Only those, who, firstly, love and then understand the art. Levon Lachikyan‚Äôs articles are marked by the synthesis of these two. As a result, the reader waits for his articles. An appraisal, considered the highest for any author‚Äù.

During the 16th century the Spanish strategy was to complement the fortification work in its Caribbean ports with forts in the Strait of Magellan. As attempts at settling and fortifying the Strait of Magellan were abandoned the Spanish began to fortify the Captaincy General of Chile and other parts of the west coast of the Americas. The coastal fortifications and defense system was at its peak in the mid-18th century. History=16th century= In 1578 Francis Drake inaugurated an era of privateering and piracy along the coasts of Chile. Responding to this threat the viceroy of Peru sent in 1579 an expedition commanded by Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa to the Strait of Magellan in order to explore the feasibility of fortifying it and by virtue of that controlling the entrance to the Pacific Ocean from the Atlantic. After surveying the strait Sarmiento departed to Spain and obtained there through the king ships and settlers for a definitive colonization and fortifying project. Duke of Alba supported the project and suggested some modifications. The plan included the building one fort on each side of Primera Angostura, a sound within the strait. The expedition that sailed from Spain included about 350 settlers and 400 soldiers. Back in the Strait of Magellan Sarmiento founded the cities of Nombre de Jes√∫s and Ciudad del Rey Don Felipe in 1584. Nombre de Jes√∫s was abandoned after only five months of existence and its population sought themselves to Ciudad del Rey Don Felipe. There, realizing there was not enough food for all, Andr√©s de Biedma ordered the people to scatter along the northern coast of the strait and wait for any vessel that could provide aid. Sarmiento's resupply expedition never did arrive at the straits, this was due to a storm and only a few settlers survived to be rescued by other navigators. =17th century= In 1600 local Huilliche joined the Dutch corsair Baltazar de Cordes to attack the Spanish settlement of Castro. While this was a sporadic attack the Spanish believed the Dutch could attempt to ally the Mapuches and establish a stronghold in southern Chile. The Spanish knew of the Dutch plans to establish themselves at the ruins of Valdivia so they attempted to re-establish Spanish rule there before the Dutch arrived again.Bengoa 2003, pp. 450‚Äì451. The Spanish attempts were thwarted during the 1630s when Mapuches did not allow the Spanish to pass by their territory. With the Spanish blocked from entering Valdivia via land the much waited Dutch invasion met no resistance when it reached the ruins of old Spanish city in August 1643. Before that the Dutch did however engage the Spanish at Carelmapu and sacked Castro. The Spanish in these two localities had been instructed to use a scorched earth strategy against the incoming invaders. While the Dutch abandoned their new colony after only two months in October 1643, their invasion caused great alarm among Spanish authorities and triggered the return of the Spanish to Valdivia. The construction of the Valdivian Fort System began in 1645.Robbert Kock The Dutch in Chili at coloniavoyage.comLane 1998, pp. 88‚Äì92 Having heard from a letter to Juan Manqueante that the Dutch had plans to return to the location, the Spanish viceroy in Peru sent from El Callao in Peru 1000 men in twenty ships and ordered 2000 men to march by land from Central Chile in 1644 to resettle Valdivia and fortify it. The land troops never made it to Valdivia, probably due to Mapuche resistance. The massive fleet, that added two ships in Chile, was unprecedented in the region.Lane 1998, p. 90. The building and maintenance of the Valdivian Fort System became a burden for the Spanish colonial finances, more so considering that the Dutch did not return to establish their planned colony. =18th century= Ever since the Bourbon dynasty assumed power in Spain during the early 18th century the threat of a French attack dissipated, instead the British seemed to be the foremost menace to Spains possessions in Chile. The War of Jenkins' Ear between Britain and Spain caused the British to plan an attack against the Spanish possessions in Chile. Valdivia, a fortified and valuable Spanish exclave, was selected for an attack. The attack to be commanded by George Anson proved a complete failure even before the expedition reached Spanish ports: the ships had dispersed and HMS Wager wrecked off the coast of Patagonia. Nevertheless, the British arrival caused great alarm among the Spanish who searched extensively the Patagonian archipelagoes to cleanse it from any possible British presence. In the 1740s the viceroy of Peru and the governor of Chile converged in a project to advance the frontiers of the Spanish Empire in the Southeast Pacific and prevent the establishment of a British base. As result of this plan the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands were settled and the fort of Tenquehuen established in Chonos Archipelago near Taitao Peninsula. This last fort was manned for one and half year before being abandoned. After the Tenquehuen fort was dismantled the Marquis of the Ensenada, being briefed on local affairs, recommended the establishment of a fort in the Guaitecas Archipelago, but this never happened. For Governor Antonio Narciso de Santa Mar√≠a, Chilo√© Island was the most important part of the Patagonian Archipelago recommending to concentrate on the defense of Chilo√©. It was the hope of the Spanish that when the supposed British return occurred they would find the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands fortified and settled. As consequence of the Seven Years' War the Valdivian Fort System was updated and reinforced from 1764 onwards. Other vulnerable localities of colonial Chile such as Chilo√© Archipelago, Concepci√≥n, Juan Fern√°ndez Islands and Valpara√≠so were also made ready for an eventual English attack. Inspired in the recommendations of former governor Santa Mar√≠a the Spanish founded the \\"city- fort\\" of Ancud in 1768 and separated Chilo√© from the Captaincy General of Chile into a direct dependency of the Viceroyalty of Peru. As with other 18th- century forts in Chile the establishment of Ancud caused through the new Ancud-Castro road an expansion of local trade and agriculture. Fortification engineers building 18th century forts imprinted neoclassical designs on them. =19th century= rebel assault on the Valdivian Fort System. During the War of Chilean Independence several coastal fortification were attacked. The First Chilean Navy Squadron, commanded by Thomas Cochrane, launched an amphibious attack on the Valdivian Fort System in 1820. The land troops led by Jorge Beauchef overran the forts on the southern side of Corral Bay. Then the remaining forts, in Niebla and Mancera Island were abandoned by the Spaniards who retreated to the city of Valdivia.
