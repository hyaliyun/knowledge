The battle led to the treaty of Bucharest ending the Serbo-Bulgarian War restoring peace between the two countries. Prelude After the Bulgarian victory at the Battle of Slivnitsa, fought from 17-19 November 1885, the Bulgarian army counter- attacked. The Bulgarian troops defeated the Serbs at Gurgulyat (19 November) and Dragoman (22 November), and subsequently reached the city of Pirot,–ü–µ–π—á–µ–≤, –ê. –∏ –¥—Ä. 1300 –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–∏ –Ω–∞ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–∂–∞, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è, 1984, –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ –∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—Å—Ç–≤–æ, p. 211 where the Serbian Ni≈°ava army occupied defensive positions in the hills to the east of the town. The battle On 26 November, the Bulgarians defeated the Serbian cover forces along the border and moved on to Pirot. At around 15:00 on the same day, the Bulgarian advanced guard engaged the enemy, first achieving success on the left flank of the front, after the detachment of Captain Popov had seized the heights of Divan and Cherni Vrah. On the right flank, the 10th Regiment of the Serbian ≈†umadija Division retreated followed by the two battalions sent to defend Pirot. During the skirmishes on the left flank, the Bulgarians had suffered 48 killed, 136 wounded and 27 missing, while the Serbians lost 67 soldiers, had 134 wounded and 85 captured. The Serbians were badly equipped and unprepared using second hand obsolete Russian artillery while the Bulgarian used modern German weaponry. During the night of 27 November, the Serbs regrouped and at dawn managed to retake Pirot from the Bulgarians. The column of Major Gudzhev attacked the ≈†umadija Division and the Bulgarians managed to push the Serbs to the river Temska. The retreat of the ≈†umadija Division forced the Drina Division to pull back as well and the Bulgarians pursued after them. On the left flank, the Bulgarians were also successful. The Serbs managed to hold on their position in the southern part of Pirot until the night. Later the Bulgarians, pushed the Serbs from the city and attack Serbian army positions west of the town of Pirot. The Serbians continued to hold a position to the south of the town till nightfall. Aftermath A day after the victory, the Bulgarian army prepared to continue its advance to the city of Ni≈°, which was a target of Greater Bulgarian national project, but the Austro-Hungarian delegation in the Bulgarian capital made it clear that if the Bulgarian advance continued, Austria-Hungary would have intervened in the war on the side of Serbia. As result the same day an armistice was concluded. The treaty of Bucharest on 3 March 1886 brought the brief war to an end and restored the prewar status quo. Notes *a.

The garden is located outside the Richmond Olympic Oval, an official venue for the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games. The installation consists of a wetland treatment pond, 300 ft. boardwalk, two 52 ft. pedestrian bridges, two net sculptures, and a fountain. Design Water Sky Garden, Vancouver The boardwalk and \\"sky lanterns\\" were inspired by Richmond's cultural communities. Richmond's immigrant population is the highest of any city in Canada. More than half of these immigrants are of Asian descent. The boardwalk was designed to resemble the choreography of the Dragon Dance, a performance frequently used in Chinese festivals. The Nitobe Memorial Garden and Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Chinese Garden, both in Vancouver, were important inspirations for paths, ponds and framing of the garden's landscape. The boardwalk was designed to encourage people to linger and view the garden. Water Sky Garden from underneath Top Detail of Water Sky Garden Snowy day at Water Sky Garden The pond collects rainwater from the Oval's roof and surrounding landscape. It is then purified and re-circulated to be used to irrigate the plants in the surrounding space, provide clean water for the Oval, and empty into the adjacent Fraser River. Aeration for the pond is provided by a fountain on the South side of the garden. The \\"sky lanterns\\" are made of ultraviolet-resistant PTFE fiber nets, supported by painted galvanized steel rings. At night, the lanterns are lit with submerged lights, and the boardwalk is lit with LED spotlights. The eastern lantern is 75 ft. at its largest diameter, and the netting is 25 ft. deep. The northern lantern is 52 ft. at its largest diameter. Its net is 25 ft. deep with a 14 ft. tail that descends to the pond below. The garden was designed so that participants can both look at and look through the netted sculptures without obstructing the view of the Oval building or the surrounding garden area. The initial design process began with the creation of a three-dimensional computer model created using custom software. Those forms were then translated into CAD software in order to define the geometry and surfaces of the sculpture. These digital structures were then exported to a gravity and wind simulator in order to determine the necessary twine tenacity to withstand strong winds. From this information, construction drawings are created which include specific looming patterns, color information, and lengths of meshes.

He used the garage behind his house on South Brown Street to work on automobiles and in April 1907 incorporated the Speedwell Motor Car Company. Speedwell purchased and occupied a former Dayton Machine Tool Company factory on Essex Avenue in Dayton's Edgemont neighborhood, a site that later hosted a Delco factory. The factory provided temporary space to the Wright Company in 1910 before the completion of its new airplane factory in west Dayton. The Great Dayton Flood of 1913 inundated the Speedwell factory, destroying machinery and automobiles, and the company proved unable to recover and entered receivership in 1915. Schenck later became president of the Dayton Malleable Iron Company and turned his focus to adapting high silicon iron alloys to practical uses. This led to his establishing the Duriron Company, a name which he coined, in 1917. It prospered through high demand for its products generated by the First World War and employed 1,500 people, becoming one of Dayton's leading industries.

She is an enemy of Black Canary and Green Arrow, the latter of whom she is romantically obsessed with. Cupid appears as a recurring character on the television series Arrow, played by actress Amy Gumenick. Publication history Created by writer Andrew Kreisberg and artist David Baron, the character made her first appearance in Green Arrow and Black Canary #15 (February 2009). Fictional character biography Carrie Cutter was a special ops soldier, working for a top secret program called COBALT, who thought her husband Ross had abandoned her.Green Arrow & Black Canary #15 (February 2009) During a mission in Georgia she encountered something that deeply disturbed her. She volunteered for a program that would make her fearless. It also turns her emotions up to the extreme when it comes to falling in love. Other effects included memory loss and increased strength. She fell off the radar for a long time. Years later, she found out that her husband Ross was still alive, tracked him to Star City and killed him. Green Arrow thought that the unknown man was abusing his wife so he shot an arrow at him. Cupid picked up that arrow which began her obsession with Green Arrow.Green Arrow & Black Canary #16 (March 2009) Cupid first showed up in Star City at a scene of one of Green Arrow's fights. She picked up a broken tip of one of his arrows and carved the infamous heart with an arrow through it on her chest. She began killing off some of his notable enemies in the hope that she may begin to fulfill his heart's desire. She is mentally unstable as upon getting a new haircut, she cut out the eyes of the hairdresser, for the hair was cut so perfectly that she did not want anyone else to ever have the same perfect hair.Green Arrow & Black Canary #2 (January 2008) Small time enemies killed by Cupid include Big Game, Death Dealer, Vengeance, and Slingshot,Green Arrow & Black Canary #24 (November 2009) which brought her to the attention of Star City's crime boss, Brick. When he learned of these killings, he sent his men to find out who was behind them. Within minutes of sending a street junkie out to find Cupid, she shot the junkie in the head and proceeded to fire upon Brick himself. As this did not work, she had a back-up plan in the form of a wrecking ball suspended from a crane. The crane cut through the building Brick was in and left him dead, cut in half at the waist. She had captured Merlyn from the police department, drugged him and lured Green Arrow to Star City Museum. Cupid had it arranged that Green Arrow, with a new-found darkness within him, would kill Merlyn and help himself achieve his hearts desire. Green Arrow did not follow through with Merlyn's death after seeing a way out of it and instead incapacitated him. This angered Cupid, who triggered an explosion. We next see her waking Green Arrow up underground.Green Arrow & Black Canary #23 (October 2009) She had chained him to the subway tracks and planned on dying with him in her arms so that it may be a romantically famous death, but Black Canary rescued him. Before admitting defeat, Cupid slit an unconscious Merlyn's throat. Knowing that Green Arrow and Black Canary would not let him die (despite him being one of their worst and most destructive enemies) she used that chance to escape. She has started to aid the city during a riot, using a bow, that she admits she needs practice with. This is mainly to impress Green Arrow, but has not succeeded.Green Arrow & Black Canary #27 (February 2010) After spending some time in prison, she is broken out by her rival Black Canary because her life was believed to be in danger. Later she encounters Everyman who believes himself to be Green Arrow and they begin to work together against the real Green Arrow and company.Green Arrow & Black Canary #28 (March 2010) She is seen to still be obsessed with Oliver and only considers Everyman to be \\"good in a pinch\\". Cupid later killed Everyman herself, declaring their relationship as \\"a rebound thing\\".Green Arrow & Black Canary #29 (April 2010) Powers and abilities Cupid is an exceptional hand-to-hand combatant. She possesses enhanced strength, speed, endurance, sense, etc.; but at the cost of her own sanity.

Cupid (Amy Gumenick) as she appears in the TV series Arrow * Carrie Cutter appears in the TV series Arrow, portrayed by actress Amy Gumenick. First appearing in season three, Cutter is a former member of the Star City Police Department's S.W.A.T. team, who was forced to leave the department because of an attachment disorder. During Slade Wilson's attack on Starling City, Cutter was saved by the Arrow, which leads to her forming an obsession with him, believing herself to be his partner in life. As \\"Cupid\\", she stalks the Arrow and kills criminals with a bow in an attempt to show how \\"right\\" for each other they are. Ultimately, she is apprehended by the Arrow, who, recognizing she is mentally ill, sends her to Amanda Waller rather than prison. Cutter is made part of the Suicide Squad and continues obsessing over the Arrow until she is saved by teammate Floyd Lawton, which leads to her transferring her obsessive devotion to him.

Born in Toulouse, the son of Jean-Pierre Rivalz (who painted and designed the city's h√¥tel de ville), Antoine became the town's official painter, and was a talented portraitist of the society of the city in the 18th century. He also produced a large number of drawings.  Life  Antoine Rivalz began his training in the studios of his father Jean-Pierre, the sculptor Marc Arcis and the artist Raymond Lafage. In his training, he was particularly interested in studying classical works and the Baroque Italian masters. From 1685 to 1687 he trained at the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture in Paris. On his return to Toulouse he received his first two commissions. In 1687 he set out for Rome, where he stayed for more than ten years. In 1694 he won second prize at the Accademia di San Luca with a drawing of The fall of the giants, with first prize going to Antonio Balestra and Felice Nardi. In Rome he became friends with other artists such as Carlo Maratta, Luigi Garzi and Benedetto Luti, and was more and more in demand for commissions from families in both Rome and Toulouse. In 1703, he returned to Toulouse and was made painter of the city's h√¥tel de ville, a post he held until his death. Supported by an important studio, he received a large number of commissions - commemorative paintings, paintings of ordinance and armour, architectural projects, restorations. This post, however, allowed him above all to forge productive relations with the city's upper classes and benefit from a near-monopoly on public, religious and private commissions in the city. He married his first cousin Louise Rivalz, with whom he had six children, including the future artist Pierre Rivalz, known as the \\"chevalier Rivalz\\". In 1726 he set up Toulouse's first art school and in 1750 letters patent from Louis XV turned it into the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture de Toulouse, the only one in France (after that in Paris) to be allowed to bear that title.  His ≈ìuvre  Rich from the varied training he had received in Toulouse, Paris and Rome, he created an original and varied style influenced by Baroque painting, classical art, 17th-century painting styles and the inheritance of the Italian masters. For instance, his work on the door of a Pharmacy presents the same subject of the Italian \\"Pestapepe\\", usually referred to Melozzo da Forl√¨. He produced a brilliant personal synthesis of them and revived the artistic life of Toulouse, choosing an aesthetic that was resolutely turned towards the 17th century and resisted the innovations of Parisian painting. His influence and his official position allowed him to influence a whole generation of 18th-century artists, creating an artistic unity which left a mark on the Toulouse painting school. After his death, his work and style was perpetuated by students such as Guillaume Cammas and Pierre Subleyras, but at the start of the 19th century his work became fell out of fashion for over a hundred years, only being fully rediscovered from the 1940s onwards.

From 1934 to 1936 Hodgkin was in the Palestine civil service, for some time being a personal secretary to High Commissioner Wauchope. There, Hodgkin started to become critical of British imperialism. Resigning from the colonial service after the April 1936 Arab uprising, he hoped to stay in Palestine but was ordered to leave by the British administration. Returning to London, where he stayed with his father's cousin Margery Fry and joined the Communist Party, Hodgkin briefly tried training as a schoolteacher, before entering adult education.

It is along Jenny Creek near Round Prairie between the Siskiyou Mountains and the foothills of the Cascade Range. History Pinehurst was one of the small sawmill towns along an early stagecoach and wagon freight route between the Rogue Valley and the Klamath Basin. This road, also known as the Green Springs Highway, was the original route of the Applegate Trail. The name \\"Pinehurst\\" comes from the word \\"pine\\" and the Old English word hurst, meaning woods. Pinehurst is named for its location in a Ponderosa Pine belt. In 1878, there was a post office in the Pinehurst area named \\"Pioneer\\"; it closed in 1882. The nearby post office named \\"Shake\\" established in 1886 was moved and renamed \\"Pinehurst\\" in 1911. In 1915, Pinehurst had a population of 20 and a public school. By 1940, Pinehurst had a population of ten. An inn at the town was formerly the supper stop on the Greyhound bus route between Ashland and Klamath Falls until it burned down. As of 1990 the only structure in the community was a two-story log structure dating to the 1920s. The log building was a roadhouse that was built when OR 66 bypassed the former Applegate Trail route. As of 2010, the building was a bed and breakfast‚Äîthe Historic Pinehurst Inn‚Äîbut has since closed. The original stagecoach stop was the 1904 ranch house at Green Springs Box R Ranch in the Pinehurst area. The owners sold part of the property in 2016 to New Frontier Ranch, which offers guest accommodations. The nearby Buckhorn Mineral Springs Resort is a historic mineral spa on the National Register of Historic Places. Education Pinehurst School, which is about two miles west of the community, in an area known as Lincoln, is the only school in the Pinehurst School District. It serves students from kindergarten through eighth grade. The 1908 school building is recognized by Jackson County as having primary historical significance. Climate This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above .

The castle was built in the High Middle Ages. The ruins of the Lauenburg stand on a foothill of the Ramberg massif above the village of Stecklenberg. It was built by Henry IV and first mentioned in the records in 1164. The construction of the two-part castle with its inner and outer wards (Vorburg and Hauptburg) probably took up to ten years. The two halves of the castle are separated by a massive defensive ditch (a neck ditch or Halsgraben), hewn out of the rock. The purpose of this impressive fortification with a total length of more than 350 metres was the protection of Quedlinburg and the nearby military roads. In 1180 the Lauenburg was captured by Frederick I (Barbarossa) during a series of warlike conflicts. Later robber barons resided in the castle for periods of time, until it was destroyed in the 14th century. Today the main castle is badly run-down. Only a few remnants of the towers and the outer walls are still left. The only structure in the entire fortification that has withstood the ravages of time and history relatively well is the keep of the outer ward. Its ruins can be seen from a long way off. The Lauenburg has a checkpoint (no. 187) in the network of hiking trails that form the Harzer Wandernadel. It is on the path by the entrance to the inn that is situated between the two parts of the castle.  Access  The castle may accessed on a footpath that runs from behind the church in Stecklenberg; there is a small car park in front of the church. The path climbs steeply past a children's play park up to the ruined castle of Stecklenburg. Beyond the ruins, the path continues uphill to the Lauenburg.

History The three founding members of the band met in Okinawa in 1998. Erick Barnes, the singer, was an active-duty US Marine stationed at Camp Hansen, while Rick Ashton and Tomlin were teenage children of Marines stationed on the island. Originally, they performed a mix of punk rock covers and original songs as The Brothels, often playing to both Japanese and military crowds in the Gate 2 District of Okinawa. In 2001, all three returned to the US and eventually regrouped in the Los Angeles area. In early 2002, they began to perform their brand of heavily blues-influenced street punk. Strongarm and the Bullies regularly performed in Southern California from early 2002 to February 2007, with several regional tours through California, Arizona and Nevada. They recorded and distributed a self-released five-song EP CD in 2002, were featured on a compilation CD from the magazine Loud Fast Rules,Loud Fast Rules Magazine Vol 2 2007 and on the Backstreets of American Oi!, vol. 2 compilation. In 2005, the band signed with the Dutch record label Rebellion Records to release their debut full-length CD ‚ÄúYou Had It Coming‚Äù, and also had the lead track on Rebellion‚Äôs punk rock tribute to Johnny Cash compilation, covering ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Take Your Guns to Town‚Äù. Their most recent recording was completed in early 2007, just days before Barnes left for a 12-month tour in Iraq. The band became a staple in the Southern California streetpunk scene, performing at venues like The Knitting Factory, Anarchy Library and The Glass House. They performed at the East Coast Oi! Fest in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in May 2008 after Barnes returned from Iraq. They appeared in the 2009 documentary film Punk's Not Dead, performing at the Drunk Tank in Echo Park, Los Angeles, California. Although the members now live in various parts of the US, the band continues to reunite and perform in Los Angeles annually.

Hanson Dam is an earthen embankment dam on the Green River, 21 miles (34 km) east of Auburn, Washington. The dam was completed in 1961 and its primary purpose is flood control along with water supply for Tacoma, Washington. After the dam's reservoir reached record levels in January 2009, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers discovered seepage in the right abutment of the dam, leading to efforts to mitigate a potential flood. Improved drainage works were completed in October 2011 and although studies are still underway, the dam was declared safe to maintain its maximum reservoir level. History and construction The Green River Valley was settled in the 1850s and became a notable farming area, until an aphid infestation destroyed the large hop crop in 1890. Since then, the area mainly consisted of dairy and berry farms, but farmers had to cope with yearly floods. These floods would lead to log jams, redirecting the Green and other rivers. Sometimes farmers would clear log jams with dynamite which led to the flooding of other farms. To deal with the matter, the Associated Improvement Clubs of South King County was formed in 1926. The association created several dikes and repaired river courses but they would soon realize more help was needed.History Link - Howard A. Hanson History It was not until 1936 that community leaders, citizens and with additional effort by Congress, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Seattle District began to search for a suitable flood control project site on the Green River. The selection was delayed by the Second World War and finally in 1949, Eagle Gorge was recommended to Congress as a site for a dam and reservoir project. In 1955, funds were appropriated for the project; Congress gave $37 million, Washington State $1.5 million and King County provided $500,000. Construction on the dam which included the relocation of 13 miles (21 km) of the Northern Pacific Railway began in February 1959. During construction in December 1959, the last devastating flood occurred on the Green River; damaging homes and removing topsoil from farms. Despite this, the dam was completed almost five months ahead of time on Christmas Day, 1961. The completion of the dam ended a 70-year era of flooding in the Green River Valley and by 1996, the dam had prevented an estimated $694 million in flood damages. The dam was originally named the Eagle Gorge Dam but was renamed by Congress in 1958 to the Howard A. Hanson Dam. Hanson led civic and government groups in an effort to construct the dam. He was largely instrumental in obtaining funding for the dam. Hanson died in 1957 before construction began. Characteristics Howard A. Hanson Dam, spillway gates and intake The Howard A. Hanson Dam is an earthen embankment structure at a length of 675 ft (205 m) and height of 235 ft (70 m). The base of the dam is 960 ft (290 m) wide and sits within Eagle Gorge, a ravine with nearly vertical rock walls. The reservoir withheld by the dam collects water from 220 square miles (570 km2) of drainage area; it is 7 miles (11 km) long. The dam structure contains a concrete spillway on its left side capable of discharging overflow at . The spillway is controlled by two 45 x 30 ft (15 x 6 m) Tainter gates while an outlet tunnel at the base of the dam is controlled by two 10 x 12 ft (3 x 4 m) Tainter gates. The dam serves its flood control purpose during the rainy season collecting and then controlling the release of flood waters through the base outlet tunnel. This process occurs as often as necessary and in the event of an extreme flood, the spillway can be used. However, spillway use has never been required. In March, the dam serves to conserve water and during the summer, releases specific amounts to assist in fish migration and spawning along with enhancing sports fishing. During the winter, the reservoir is kept near empty. The dam is located within the Tacoma watershed and public access is not allowed, creating controversy among recreation proponents for some time. Water released from the dam is diverted into a water purification facility 3 miles (5 km) downstream for civil consumption. Flooding concerns Howard A. Hanson Dam USACE annotated aerial photo In January 2009, of rainfall within 24 hours peaked water inflows behind the reservoir at , raising the reservoir level to a record high of above sea level.Water seeping through Howard Hanson Dam is picking up speed - Seattle Times - Jan 24, 2009 In comparison, the maximum authorized storage level is above sea level and the normal summer level is . The Howard A. Hanson dam had controlled and prevented a flood that would have caused an estimated $4 billion in damages.USACE Howard A. Hanson Dam FAQ However, soon after the flood the USACE discovered two depressions on the right abutment of the dam, increased water levels in groundwater monitoring wells and the appearance of sediment-laden water entering the abutment drainage tunnel. The USACE did not believe the dam was at immediate risk of failing but assessed increased danger to downstream communities until the problem was resolved. The USACE began to lower and restrict the elevation of the dam's reservoir. In addition, by November 2009, the USACE constructed an interim seepage barrier along with improving the drainage of the right abutment. These actions were estimated to reduce the chance of flooding from a 1 in 3 to a 1 in 25 chance during 2010. The level of the reservoir was restricted due to increased chances for flooding downstream. In the event of a major flood, increased releases may cause water to over-top downstream levees. Sandbags were distributed throughout the Green River Valley as the USACE continued to inspect, monitor and repair the dam. After improvements to the dam's drainage works were completed in October 2011, the dam was declared able to hold its maximum storage level. Previously in the summer, the reservoir reached normal summer levels. A full study of the dam is still underway and is expected to be published in 2013.

The test was created by Gestalt psychologist Karl Duncker and published posthumously in 1945. Duncker originally presented this test in his thesis on problem-solving tasks at Clark University. Problem The test presents the participant with the following task: how to fix and light a candle on a wall (a cork board) in a way so the candle wax won't drip onto the table below. To do so, one may only use the following along with the candle: *a book of matches *a box of thumbtacks Solution The candle problem The most efficient solution is to empty the box of thumbtacks, use the thumbtacks to nail the box to the wall, put the candle into the box, and light the candle with the match. The concept of functional fixedness predicts that the participant will only see the box as a device to hold the thumbtacks and not immediately perceive it as a separate and functional component available to be used in solving the task. Response Many of the people who attempted the test explored other creative, but less efficient, methods to achieve the goal. For example, some tried to tack the candle to the wall without using the thumbtack box, and others attempted to melt some of the candle‚Äôs wax and use it as an adhesive to stick the candle to the wall. Neither method works. However, if the task is presented with the tacks piled next to the box (rather than inside it), virtually all of the participants were shown to achieve the optimal solution, which is self defined. The test has been given to numerous people, including M.B.A. students at the Kellogg School of Management in a study investigating whether living abroad and creativity are linked. Glucksberg Glucksberg (1962) used a 2 √ó 2 design manipulating whether the tacks and matches were inside or outside of their boxes and whether subjects were offered cash prizes for completing the task quickly. Subjects who were offered no prize, termed low-drive, were told \\"We are doing pilot work on various problems in order to decide which will be the best ones to use in an experiment we plan to do later. We would like to obtain norms on the time needed to solve.\\" The remaining subjects, termed high-drive, were told \\"Depending on how quickly you solve the problem you can win $5.00 or $20.00. The top 25% of the Ss [subjects] in your group will win $5.00 each; the best will receive $20.00. Time to solve will be the criterion used.\\" (As a note, adjusting for inflation since 1962, the study's publish year, the amounts in dollars would be approximately $ and $, respectively.) The empty-boxes condition was found to be easier than the filled-boxes condition: more subjects solved the problem, and those who did solve the problem solved it faster. Within the filled-boxes condition, high-drive subjects performed worse than low-drive subjects. Glucksberg interpreted this result in terms of \\"neobehavioristic drive theory\\": \\"high drive prolongs extinction of the dominant habit and thus retards the correct habit from gaining ascendancy\\". An explanation in terms of the overjustification effect is made difficult by the lack of a main effect for drive and by a nonsignificant trend in the opposite direction within the empty-boxes condition. Another way to explain the higher levels of failure during the high-drive condition is that the process of turning the task into a competition for limited resources can create mild levels of stress in the subject, which can lead to a sympathetic nervous system response known as fight-or-flight. This stress response effectively shuts down the creative thinking and problem solving areas of the brain in the prefrontal cortex. Linguistic implications E. Tory Higgins and W. M. Chaires found that having subjects repeat the names of common pairs of objects in this test, but in a different and unaccustomed linguistic structure, such as \\"box and tacks\\" instead of \\"box of tacks\\", facilitated performance on the candle problem. This phrasing helps one to distinguish the two entities as different and more accessible. In a written version of the task given to people at Stanford University, Michael C. Frank and language acquisition researcher Michael Ramscar reported that simply underlining certain relevant materials (\\"on the table there is a _candle_ , a _box_ of _tacks_ , and a _book_ of _matches_...\\") increases the number of candle-problem solvers from 25% to 50%.

It survived for nine decades from when it opened in 1880 until closure to all traffic in 1970.  History = Facilities  Following the opening of the Greytown Branch in May 1880, construction of the line northwards steadily progressed towards Masterton. The first train was able to cross the Waingawa River in late July and due to a donation of 2 acres of land by Donald and Frances Nicolson a shelter was able to be erected at Clareville by the end of August. The station opened to all traffic along with the Woodside ‚Äì Masterton section of the line on 1 November 1880. Former access road to the loading bank. In addition to the shelter shed there was also a loop siding with a capacity of 19 wagons and a loading siding that was used by William Booth's timber mill. The mill, which was located between Carterton and Clareville, later established its own private siding in 1885. The loading bank was extended to a length of in 1924 to enable the loading and discharging of race horses. The extra capacity was required to serve up to six 4-wheel horseboxes. The work order noted that the extension should be ready by 15 October 1924 in preparation for use for race traffic on 18 October; work was completed on 4 October. The Taratahi Dairy Company complained in April 1925 that it, and others, had experienced difficulty in delivering cans of cream to the station. The provision of a cart dock was requested which was duly authorised by the District Engineer. It was constructed at the south end of the station and the District Engineer was advised that work had been completed on 30 June 1925.  Services  Services through Clareville started with two return weekday mixed trains, an arrangement that lasted many decades. No regular passenger-only workings were provided save for the occasional holiday excursion trains. As was typically the case for flag stations, trains only stopped to pick up or set down passengers and wagons if required to do so. The Wairarapa Line was completed to its northern terminus at Woodville in 1897 and this enabled the Railways Department to introduce the Napier Mail to the Wairarapa Line. This train had earlier run as the Napier Express via the Wellington and Manawatu Railway and the Manawatu Gorge. This arrangement lasted until 1909 when the Napier Mail once again became the Napier Express and reverted to its original route. Thereafter the primary passenger service through the Wairarapa was the Wairarapa Mail which was essentially the Wellington to Woodville portion of the old Napier Mail. From 1936 when the NZR RM class Wairarapa-type railcars were introduced passengers from Clareville had a much faster service to points both north and south. The Wairarapa Mail passenger trains continued to run but in 1944 were reduced from their Monday ‚Äì Saturday timetable to a thrice weekly service due to a severe coal shortage. It never recovered from this and was withdrawn completely in 1948. Several years later the Rimutaka Tunnel was opened, bringing an end to the mixed trains that had been plying the Wairarapa Line and the withdrawal of the Wairarapa-type railcars, and ushering in the era of the twin-set railcars. The 1959 railcar timetable lists Clareville as a \\"stops if required\\" station for both northbound and southbound services. In a review of sidings at unattended stations in 1953 it was noted of Clareville that inward goods comprised approximately 12 wagons of coal and 6 wagons of shooks for the Carrington Dairy Company, who consigned their outward goods at Carterton. Outward goods consisted primarily of hay and straw, amounting to approximately 12 wagons per year. It was considered that only minor inconvenience would be caused in closing Clareville to goods traffic and instead handling it at Carterton. In response to the review the District Engineer stated he had no objection to the lifting of the goods siding at Clareville. After the possibility of new business at Clareville from Airlift (N.Z.) was aborted on 11 June 1956, closure of the station to goods traffic was confirmed and a request to lift the goods siding was put in hand on 20 November 1957 with work being completed by 1 March 1958.  Miscellaneous  A narrow escape from a serious accident occurred in 1898 when a buggy containing two ladies was drawn beside the line waiting for the Napier-Wellington express. The horse became frightened at the approach of the train and plunged blindly into the engine. The horse was knocked down but was uninjured. The buggy was left broken however the occupants also escaped unhurt.Poverty Bay Herald, 21 November 1898, \\"News Items\\"  Today  Nothing remains at the former site of the Clareville station. The shelter shed was removed when the station closed in 1970 and all private sidings in the vicinity have also since been closed. The station building was persevered at a private home in Masterton, has since been moved in November 2017 to Carterton railway station.

A refinement of the Iris printer, the Veris also uses a continuous flow ink system to produce continuous-tone output on specially designed media. Unlike most inkjet printers which fire drops only when needed, the Veris uses eight 1 micrometer glass jets that operate continuously under high pressure, vibrated by a piezoelectric crystal to produce drops at a 1 MHz rate, or 8 million drops per second in total. Drops that are not needed to form the image are deflected electrostatically into a waste collection system, and individual drops can be directed to a specific position on the media.

History The Veris printer was originally developed by Iris Graphics, which was acquired by Scitex and later merged with Creo Products Inc.. In 2005 Creo was purchased by Kodak. The Veris was first released in 2004 and production of the Veris ended in 2008, although the product is still supported and in use as of 2010. Adoption of the Veris was less than stellar as the quality of drop-on-demand inkjet printers continues to approach the quality of Veris output.

The Veris uses an automated stack fed media tray. The printer incorporates a small video camera that is used to scan media marks printed on the edges of the media. These are effectively like two-dimensional bar-code marks that uniquely identify each sheet of media and contain other information such as the media type and even the lot number the media was produced from. The software prevents the media from being printed on more than twice - it is possible to print on one half of the media, flip the media around and print on the other half. The software also prevents the wrong type of media from being used for the wrong job, and can search for the correct media from the input tray of the printer. Later models of the Veris include an in-line spectrophotometer to further automate the calibration of the printer and verify the color standard of proofs printed. Around the same time Hewlett Packard added an in-line spectrophotometer to their HP 2100 printer. Years later Epson added an in-line spectrophotometer to their Stylus 7900/9900 printer line. The Veris software evolved into the Kodak Proofing Software which is used to support Kodak's ApprovalKodak APPROVAL System and Matchprint InkJetKodak MATCHPRINT Inkjet System solutions.

It was first established outside the city walls, near the Matabiau quarter, then, between 1310 and 1341 moved to the corner of rue du Mus√©e and rue des Arts. In 1790 it ceased to be a convent and today its buildings house the Mus√©e des Augustins. History=The construction of the convent In 1269 a community of Hermits of St. Augustine was founded outside the city of Toulouse, near to the Montolieu quarter. The construction was due to the Chapter of Canons Regular of St. Sernin who undertook to build a convent in exchange for land and rights that newcomers granted them from the donations they had received (Departmental Archives of Haute Garonne, 101 H 638). As frequently happens in the history of religious foundations, this initial location proved inadequate to the needs of the community. In 1309/1310, the hermits of St. Augustine obtained the Pope's Clement V approval to sell this first building, and purchase the land to build the existing buildings that lie within the walls of the city, in the parish of Saint- Etienne. The canons of Saint-Sernin objected to the transfer, but, in 1326 sold three houses to the hermits for the price of 3500 guilders in exchange of a part of the wax sheets received by the Augustinians for a burial. Jean Lobres, prime contractor of Toulouse's cathedral participated in the construction of the apse of the church. The layout of the church is typical of the southern Gothic style. The apse has three chapels that open directly onto the large, single nave, there is no transept, and in the upper parts, sections have been cut out. By 1341 the foundations of the monastery were well established. The completed church was painted in the style typical of northern Spain during the first half of the fourteenth century and decorated with miniatures produced in the royal court at the time of Philip IVth of France (Philip the Fair). The campanile is built on a square and close to the chorus. Access is via the opening which is now located in the vestry. The construction of the eastern part of monastery began in 1341. Construction of the other three parts of the building were only begun in 1396 by the mason Jean Maurin. Ninety years later, in 1396, the cloister was completed.  The fire of 1463  Starting on 7 May 1463 and lasting for nearly two weeks, a fire (started by a careless baker) destroyed much of the city of Toulouse. As was the case at the Carmelite convent, most of the roof collapsed. With the help of the faithful and the church, reconstruction of the roof began in 1495 through the work of masons Martin Pujol and Pierre d'Arroye. The work was quickly completed and the building was rededicated on 30 June 1504.  The decline of the convent  Up until the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the convent was home to two hundred monks. But then numbers started to decline; by 1518 there were no more than 140, and the fall continued. In 1649 there were only 60 and in 1680 there were only 31. By the time of the French Revolution only a few remained. In addition, in 1542, the convent was the victim of looting; many books and records were stolen from the Library, along with liturgical objects and valuable furniture. On 14 September 1550 (the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross), lightning struck the bell tower. The upper floors were destroyed, causing extensive damage in the surrounding area. This event marked the beginning of the decline of the monastery. The financial and material difficulties could not be overcome and the bell tower was never reconstructed, instead it was lowered by one floor. In May 1562, in the aftermath of the revolt of the Huguenots, three Augustinians were flogged in public, apostatized, and married to three Augustinian nuns for having left their convent. During this time, all the Augustinian nuns (bar one) of Toulouse became part of the Protestant Reformation, and the house was donated to the Jesuits (the Chapel of the Black Penitents). In a decree of 2 November 1789 the convent became a national asset, and was decommissioned during the suppression of the monastic orders in 1790. Since 27 August 1795 it has housed the Toulouse Museum of Art.

Known for most of its length as Dares Beach Road, the state highway runs from MD 2 and MD 4 in Prince Frederick east to Chesapeake Avenue in Dares Beach. MD 402 was mostly constructed in 1932. Both termini have changed multiple times; the state highway settled into its present routing in the late 1950s. Route description View east along MD 402 in Prince Frederick MD 402 begins at an intersection with MD 2 and MD 4, which run concurrently as Solomons Island Road, in the northern end of Prince Frederick. The roadway continues west as West Dares Beach Road to Prince Frederick Boulevard. MD 402 heads east as two- lane undivided Dares Beach Road, which intersects Armory Road and passes the Calvert County Fairgrounds and Calvert High School. The state highway passes through a forested area with scattered residential subdivisions. Between Prince Frederick and Dares Beach, MD 402 intersects Wilson Road, which heads north toward Plum Point. On the western edge of Dares Beach, the old alignment of MD 402, which is unsigned MD 768 (Dares Wharf Road), splits to the northeast. MD 402 continues east as Branch Street to its eastern terminus at Chesapeake Avenue, one block west of the Chesapeake Bay shoreline. History MD 402 was constructed as a gravel road from MD 2 in Prince Frederick, which originally followed Armory Road, to Wilson Road near Dares Beach in 1932. When MD 2 was relocated on the north side of Prince Frederick around 1942, MD 402 was extended south along Armory Road to Main Street (then MD 2, now MD 765). The portion of Armory Road north of MD 402 was designated MD 750. In 1957, the state highway was extended east from Wilson Road to Dares Beach using what is now MD 768. MD 402 was removed from Armory Road the same year when the road was transferred to county control. The state highway was reconstructed with a wider bituminous concrete surface starting in 1957 from the Prince Frederick end. The reconstruction was completed in 1959, the same year the highway was extended to its present western terminus at MD 2. MD 402 was rerouted to its present eastern terminus in 1960.

He studied Romance languages at the University of Vienna, obtaining his PhD in 1913. After World War I, he moved back to his native Slovene Littoral, which had been annexed to Italy, and was administered as part of the Julian March (Venezia Giulia) region. He worked as professor of French in high schools in Gorizia, Idrija, Tolmin, Udine, Perugia and Venice. Together with France Bevk, Budal was one of the very few Slovene authors which remained in Italy after the Fascist takeover in 1922. Due to the policies of Fascist Italianization, he was forced to publish most of his works under various pseudonyms in Slovene journals in the neighbouring Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In the late 1920s, Budal emerged as a prolific and renowned author of short stories, mostly published in the literary magazine Ljubljanski zvon from Ljubljana. After World War II, he was included in the Yugoslav diplomatic delegation at the Paris Peace Conference which decided the new border between Italy and Yugoslavia. After the establishment of the Free Territory of Trieste in 1947, Budal moved to Trieste, where he became the director of the Slovene language theatre. He was also famous for his translations of French Italian authors to Slovene. Among others, he translated Alessandro Manzoni's The Betrothed, Boccaccio's Decameron, and short stories by Grazia Deledda and Guy de Maupassant. He died in Trieste.

He returned to This American Life in the early 2000s, where he reported, more recently, on the parents enrolled in the Harlem Children's Zone's Baby College. His writing has appeared in Slate, GQ, Esquire, and The New Yorker. He lives with his wife and son in Austin, Texas and Montauk, New York. Books Tough is the author of Whatever It Takes: Geoffrey Canada's Quest to Change Harlem and America and How Children Succeed: Grit, Curiosity, and the Hidden Power of Character, which he published through Houghton Mifflin in 2008 and 2012 (respectively). Whatever It Takes detailed the Harlem Children's Zone project, a multi-pronged effort within a ninety-seven block area of New York City founded in 1997 by Geoffrey Canada. Tough described how Canada has \\"believed that he could find the ideal intervention for each age of a child‚Äôs life, and then connect those interventions into an unbroken chain of support\\", with the Zone functioning as a social and economic \\"conveyor belt\\" working from children's birth to their college age. The New York Times ran a supportive review by Linda Perlstein of the National Education Writers Association; she wrote, \\"when it comes to an introduction to the debate about poverty and parenting in urban America, you could hardly do better than Tough‚Äôs book.\\" How Children Succeed built upon the work of James Heckman, University of Chicago economist and Nobel lauterate, that stated that education should focus more on promoting the psychological traits of \\"conscientiousness\\" among children at young ages rather than more IQ-related studies later in life. Tough wrote explicitly, \\"There is no anti- poverty tool that we can provide for disadvantaged young people that will be more valuable than character strengths\\". He cited research such as the famous Perry Preschool Project to state that nurturing, supportive personal relationships with adults in educational settings promote non-cognitive attributes that lead to higher incomes, less criminality, and other benefits, even when children face harsh early environments, to deliver a message that Tough found \\"a bit warm and fuzzy\\" but \\"rooted in cold, hard science\\". He refers to the work of Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck, who studied how students instructed that people can boost themselves intellectually get higher grades than those believing in a fixed idea of intelligence, as a key example. The Washington Monthly ran a positive review by Thomas Toch, who stated that Tough made \\"a compelling case\\" in \\"an engaging book that casts the school reform debate in a provocative new light\\". The Boston Globe ran a supportive article by Jenifer B.

Origins Founded in December 2001 by gay refugees from Armenia, the group aimed at pressuring the Armenian government to remove its law against gay men, article 116 of the Armenian penal code. Actions AGLA France members' sit in demonstration against hate crimes, Paris, circa February 2004 AGLA France at the Gay and Lesbian Pride march, Paris. Banner reads \\"Armenia must abolish the anti-gay law\\", circa June 2002 In May 2003 AGLA France launched \\"ThePink\\", the first LGBT online magazine in the Armenian language. By promoting public awareness on such issues as homophobia, coming out and HIV/STI prevention, AGLA sought to prepare the ground for the movement in favor of LGBT rights in Armenia. In August 2003, President Robert Kocharyan ratified Armenia's new penal code which removes the former anti-gay article 116. In late 2004, Armen Avetisyan, leader of Armenian Aryan Union (AAU), an ultra-nationalist Armenian political party, announced that some senior Armenian officials were gay. That prompted heated debates in parliament that were broadcast over the public TV channel. Some members of Armenian Parliament stated that any member found to be gay should resign. AGLA France organized a protest to denounce the AAU's homophobic campaign and the denigration of gays by Armenian lawmakers and media outlets. AGLA France also picketed in front of the Armenian embassy in Paris. The association also wrote an open letter to the President of Armenia that was published a few days later in the newspaper \\"Haykakan Zhamanak\\". In 2005, AGLA France invited two young men from Armenia to participate in ILGA- Europe's annual conference which was held in Paris. A year later Menq/WFCE, the first gay-operated NGO to fight HIV/AIDS, was registered in Yerevan. In 2006, two members of AGLA France celebrated an informal wedding ceremony in the Etchmiadzin Cathedral (Holy See of the Armenian Apostolic Church). An article published in the newspaper 168 Zham (168 Hours) about this improvised marriage provoked a scandal and indignation at local conservative media outlets and among politicians and religious officials.

These remained popular into the 21st century. Life and works Lorna was the daughter of G. H. Leatham and his wife Edit (n√©e Rutter). She went to Durham High School for Girls and then attended Le Manoir, a finishing school in Lausanne, Switzerland. She gained a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in English literature at Durham University in 1926 and there met her husband, the Rev. Victor Hill, an Anglican clergyman. They were married in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1928. In 1931 they moved to the remote parish of Matfen, Northumberland, where she played the organ in church and ran a Sunday school.Caroline Bacon, \\"The storyteller for schoolgirls\\", Evergreen, Winter 1996‚Äì1997, pp. 108‚Äì13. Hill's career as an author began when her daughter Vicki (Shirley Victorine), then about ten years old, found a story her mother had written as a child and asked for more about its characters. The result was a series of eight books about Marjorie & Co, illustrated by author herself. These began to be published in London in 1948. They were followed by the Patience series and several others. When Vicki left home to be a ballet student at Sadler's Wells in London, Hill missed her and began to write her Dream of Sadler's Wells series. She eventually wrote a total of 40 children's books, as well as La Sylphide, a commissioned biography of the dancer Marie Taglioni and two romances for adults, published in 1978. Hill was then obliged to stop writing by ill health. She is said to have been firm with publishers and to have earned more from her books than many of her contemporaries. Translations of some titles into several other languages appeared, including less usual ones such as Finnish (by Pirkko Bistr√∂m, 1991), Indonesian (1994), Czech (1995) and Slovenian (by Bernarda Petelin≈°ek, 1996). In private life, Hill took an interest in animal rights that led to conflict with neighbouring farmers. She moved late in life to Keswick, Cumbria, where she lived with Vicki. She died on 17 August 1991.Retrieved 2 April 2011.

He was the Liberal member for Gordon in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1976 to 1992, and Minister from the Environment from 1989 to 1992. Career The son of Sir John Moore, he was educated at Knox Grammar School. He worked in various manual positions, including an iron ore mine in the Northern Territory, and in 1974 became Treasurer and Honorary Secretary of the Industrial Relations Society of Australia. In 1976, he was elected to the New South Wales Parliament as the Liberal member for Gordon. He completed his Bachelor of Law through the University of New South Wales in 1977, in which year he also became a Shadow Minister. In May 1983, he undertook an observer mission to Sri Lanka on behalf of the International Commission of Jurists and was the last western observer on the Jaffna Peninsula prior to the outbreak of the civil war involving the Tamil Tigers. Moore, who was convenor of the Liberal Friends of Israel, was appointed Minister for the Environment and Assistant Minister for Transport in 1988, when the Coalition won government under Nick Greiner. His portfolio was reduced to Environment only in 1989. Metherell affair In April 1992, Moore announced a public exhibition and submission process for a National Parks and Wildlife Service assessment report for twenty three nominated wilderness areas, having been influenced by former Liberal minister-turned Independent MP Terry Metherell's \\"Wilderness (Declaration of New Areas) Bill 1992\\". Metherell was offered a position with the Environment Protection Agency by the government, which he accepted, but the Legislative Assembly referred Metherell's appointment to the Independent Commission Against Corruption, which found that the dealings had been corrupt. Premier Greiner and Moore both resigned, although the Supreme Court of New South Wales later ruled that the ICAC had overreached its powers in making the decision. The by-election for Moore's seat was won by Liberal candidate Jeremy Kinross. After leaving politics After his resignation in July 1992, Moore was appointed as Executive Director of the NSW Master Builders Association. His brief was to clean up the Association after adverse findings made in the NSW Royal Commission into the Building Industry. After implementing a wide range of reforms to the Association's management, rules and finances, Moore resigned in late 1993. He moved to Canberra, taking up appointment as an Assistant Secretary in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet as head of the Aboriginal Reconciliation Branch. In this role, he was also Secretary to the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. After the change of Commonwealth government in 1996, Moore returned to Sydney and commenced practice at the Sydney Bar in 1997. He practised primarily in commercial, planning, environmental and building law. In November 2002, he was appointed by the Carr government as a Commissioner of the NSW Land and Environment Court. In March 2009, he was appointed the Court's Senior Commissioner. He completed a post- graduate Diploma in Planning (Distinction) at the University of Technology (Sydney), graduating in early 2009. In July 2011, he was appointed (by the O'Farrell government) Co-Chair (with Ron Dyer - a former Carr government Minister) to undertake a review of the NSW planning system. In December 2011, he and Mr Dyer released an Issues Paper based on an extensive, State-wide community and stakeholder consultation process. After consideration of the more than 600 submissions to the Issues Paper (and earlier submissions), Volume 1 (Major Issues) and Volume 2 (Other Issues) of their Review Paper with recommendations for a new planning system in NSW were prepared and provided to the Minister for Planning and Infrastructure. On Saturday 14 July 2012 the Minister released Mr Moore and Mr Dyer's Review Report, The Way Ahead for Planning in NSW Volume 1 (Major Issues) and Volume 2 (Other Issues), together with the Government's initial response to the Review, A New Planning System for NSW - Green Paper. The release of these papers marked the end of their work on the Review. He then resumed his role at the Land and Environment Court. In June 2015, he was appointed an Acting Judge of the Court. From 4 January 2016, he was appointed as a Judge of the Court, being sworn in on 2 February 2016. In 2017, he initiated a trial of conducting proceedings in longer trials, in the Court's resumption compensation jurisdiction, on a paperless basis. Virtually all material was tendered on a USB stick and projected, as need arose, on a screen or the courtroom wall. The technology used was deliberately unsophisticated - comprising a PC connected to a data projector. The judge and counsel each had a laser pointer to direct attention the relevant material being considered. The first two such trials - presided over by Justice Moore - saved an estimated 100,000 pages of photocopying with additional energy and other environmental savings. This new process also provided access to justice benefits as all in the courtroom (including parties to the litigation and other lay observers) were able to be completely informed of what was being dealt with at any given time. Three more paperless trials took place prior to the end of the 2017 Law Term (one continuing in 2018) and more have been scheduled for 2018. The potential long term environmental and cost savings are significant and the reform will continue in longer civil matters in the Court. Family life Moore was married four times. His first marriage in 1973 produced no children; on 7 July 1979, he married Jane Stackpool, with whom he had twin daughters. They were later divorced, and Moore married Eve Gavel in 1994, with whom he had one son. They too were divorced, and Moore made his final marriage, to Leanne Philpott, on 26 March 2009. They have two children, a daughter, Emily, (2002) and a son, Luke (2004).

He also played in India, Sri Lanka, Australia and New Zealand as a member of official Marylebone Cricket Club touring teams, though he did not play Test cricket. School and early cricket Earle was educated at Harrow School and was in the school's cricket team as a fast bowler and middle order batsman for four years. He was captain of Harrow against Eton College in the Eton v Harrow match at Lord's in 1910, known as Fowler's match, when Eton pulled off a sensational victory: having followed on 165 runs behind, Eton were only four runs ahead when the ninth wicket of the second innings fell and eventually set Harrow a target of just 55 to win. The Eton bowler Robert Fowler then took eight Harrow wickets for 23 as Harrow were all out for 45, leaving Eton winners by nine runs. The match is the subject of an article at www.cricinfo.com, in which Earle's captaincy, and specifically the decision to remove Harold Alexander, later Earl Alexander of Tunis, from the Harrow bowling attack and to bowl himself, was seen as a contributory factor in Eton's recovery. In 1911, Earle appeared twice in first-class cricket for Surrey, taking four wickets in the two games. But he played no more first- class cricket before the First World War. Earle served in the Rifle Brigade during the First World War, reaching the rank of captain before his discharge in 1919. In 1916 he is recorded as being on half-pay because of illness. Another source says that he was wounded in the war. Return to cricket Before his discharge from the services, Earle played in a non-first-class match for the Royal Air Force against the Army, opening the bowling and top- scoring in a poor RAF first innings. In 1921, he returned to first-class cricket with Surrey, playing in two matches against Cambridge University and Oxford University at The Oval. In the Cambridge match, he took five second innings wickets for 137 runs as Cambridge ran up a total of 460 for six: this was his only five-wicket-innings return in first-class cricket and therefore these remained as his career-best bowling figures. In 1922, Earle played in one match for Somerset, and from 1923 onwards he appeared fairly regularly for the county until the end of the 1929 season. His role at Somerset was primarily as a hard-hitting middle-order batsman, and though he took useful wickets in his first four seasons in Somerset, he bowled more than 160 overs in only one season, 1926. Earle's only century for Somerset came in his first regular season, 1923. In the match against Gloucestershire at Bristol, he came to the wicket with Somerset at 331 for five, with Dar Lyon having already scored a century. Wisden, normally staid in its prose, reported that Earle was \\"amazing\\": he made 76 in \\"just over half an hour\\" to the close of play and then, when Somerset batted on into the second day, went on himself to finish with 111. By the mid-1920s, Earle was playing cricket in the majority of matches for Somerset and in 1926 he played in 28 games, reaching 893 runs at an average of 21.78 in the season and also taking 30 wickets, both of them his highest season aggregates. Wisden referred to his \\"exceptional driving\\" and, 40 years later, wrote that \\"while by no means a stylist, (he) used his considerable physique to hit the ball tremendously hard\\". After 1926, Earle was less effective in county cricket, and his highest score in his last four English seasons of regular cricket ‚Äì 1927, 1928, 1929 and 1931 ‚Äì was only 67, made in the match against Lancashire at Old Trafford in 1927. Unusually for Earle, in this innings he was not out: he was unbeaten in only seven of his 295 first-class innings, a very low percentage for a No 6 or No 7 batsman. Overseas cricket Much of Earle's cricket in his Somerset days was played for amateur and touring sides, and he continued with this cricket after he stopped playing for Somerset in 1931. His first overseas venture was a short tour to the Netherlands with the Free Foresters cricket team in 1921, and he repeated the venture a year later. At the end of the 1924 season, he was a member of another amateur touring team, the Incogniti, who played several non- first-class matches in North American cricketing strongholds around New York City and Philadelphia. More serious in cricketing terms was the official Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour to India, which lasted from October 1926 to the end of February 1927. The Imperial Cricket Conference in London in 1926 had decided to encourage India, New Zealand and the West Indies to develop their local cricket infrastructures with a view to widening the number of Test cricket-playing countries, which had until then been restricted to England, Australia and South Africa and the MCC tour was part of this encouragement. Matches were also played in Ceylon and in territories that later became Pakistan and Burma. The MCC team was a strong one, captained by the England captain Arthur Gilligan and including Test players Bob Wyatt, Maurice Tate and Andrew Sandham. Earle held his own in this exalted company, making 767 runs at the, for him, high average of 34.86 runs per innings; his bowling was scarcely used at all. The batting included an innings of 130, the highest score of his first-class career and his second century, in the match against the Hindus at the Bombay Gymkhana ground in Mumbai. The innings included 26 runs from five consecutive balls, and he hit eight sixes and 11 fours; he put on 154 in 65 minutes with Tate. Despite this innings, he was not picked for the two representative matches against \\"All-India\\" which were the forerunners of Test cricket: a result of the tour was that Gilligan reported back to MCC that India appeared ready for Test cricket, though the failure to form a cricket board in India until 1928 meant the tour of England by an All-India side that year still not feature any Tests. Three years later, Earle was a member of a similar MCC tour in 1929-30, this time to New Zealand, with matches played on the journey in both Sri Lanka and Australia. This tour coincided with a similar MCC tour to the West Indies and on both tours the representative matches were judged to be Test matches, though several regular England players sat out both tours and other players received their only Test caps by playing in the matches on the twin tours. Earle was not one of these players: in seven first-class matches in Australia and New Zealand, he failed to pass 50 in any innings and he was not picked for any of the four matches against New Zealand. In one of the matches in Australia on the way to New Zealand, Earle hit Australian spin bowler Clarrie Grimmett for 22 runs in an over, with three sixes; in New Zealand, he scored 98 in 40 minutes in a minor match against Taranaki. The travelling went on. In both 1932 and 1934, he went on the tours of Egypt organised by Hubert Martineau, though the matches were not judged to be first-class. On the first of these, he was badly hurt in a motorcycle accident, and that forced his retirement from first-class cricket. Private and later life Earle was married three times, his first two marriages ending in divorce. In 1918, he married Isabel Bridget Broughton-Knight, known as Bridget. They had a daughter, Audrey, in 1920, but divorced in 1922. He then married Helen Elliot in 1924, but they divorced in 1927. The next year she married Earle's Somerset cricket colleague Dar Lyon. Finally, he married Bridget Joan Sherston in 1935 and they had two daughters and a son between 1940 and 1945. In the Second World War, Earle returned to the services, this time in the Royal Air Force. He is recorded as a squadron leader of the Auxiliary Air Force transferring from the Balloon Branch to administrative and special duties in 1941. And then he is recorded as standing down from his commission in 1945.

After an initial British attack was repulsed, a second attempt under General Studholme Hodgson forced a beachhead. A second landing was made, and after a six-week siege the island's main citadel at Le Palais was stormed, consolidating British control of the island. A French relief effort from the nearby mainland was unable to succeed because of British control of the sea. The British occupied the island for two years before returning it in 1763 following the Treaty of Paris. Background The Southern Secretary, William Pitt, was the author of the expedition against Belle √éle and pushed ahead with it despite widespread doubt amongst his colleagues. In 1756 Britain and France had formally gone to war after initial clashes in North America. The French began the war successfully by capturing Menorca a British island in the Mediterranean. After this Britain had gained the initiative at sea and had begun a series of naval incursions on the French coast, such as the Raid on Rochefort (1757) and the Raid on Cherbourg (1758), pioneered by the Southern Secretary William Pitt. While the practical success of these was limited, they caused serious alarm throughout France and forced the French government to detach large numbers of troops to guard coastal areas against further British raids. Pitt suspended the campaign in late 1758 following an unsuccessful landing at Saint Cast, while remaining open to the idea of further operations against the vulnerable French coast. In 1759 France attempted to launch a major invasion of Britain, but following the naval defeats of Lagos and Quiberon Bay and a near continuous British blockade of French ports, this plan had to be abandoned; for much of the remainder of the war the French navy remained at anchor. From 1757 the British launched a series of attacks on French colonies around the globe, leading many of them being captured. The Conquest of Canada in 1759-60 left Britain in control of a large area of formerly French territory, and Pitt anticipated that this would lead to a peace agreement, as many in Paris sought to bring an end to the costly war. Pitt had planned to send an expedition to capture Mauritius, a major French naval base in the Indian Ocean. However, with the likelihood of a peace congress fast approaching Pitt wanted something more immediate and tangible which could be exchanged for captured British or German territory, rather than the Mauritius which would take a long time to capture and news of which would take months to reach Europe. He was also aware of Spain's potential entry into the war, which would also make it prudent to keep ships closer to home to protect against a possible invasion.Corbett, p. 150‚Äì54. Pitt now decided to switch the focus of an expedition to the French coast. The island of Belle √éle was located close to Lorient and the major naval centre of Brittany and offered command of the Bay of Biscay.Anderson, p. 419. He now advocated that it should be seized and turned into a British military base which could then be used as a staging point for further attacks on the French mainland. Pitt had originally proposed an attack on Belle √éle in October 1760, but it was strongly opposed by the Duke of Newcastle and vetoed by King George II on the grounds that more focus should be given to the ongoing campaign in Germany.Dull, p. 184‚Äì85. Pitt now revived the project, helped by the fact that the old King had died and been succeeded by his grandson. Both Lord Anson and Sir Edward Hawke were opposed to such an expedition, but Pitt was not put off by the opposition of two of Britain's most respected admirals.Anderson, p. 419. On 25 March George III signed secret orders now making Belle √éle the target.Corbett, p. 149. The command of the army was to be given to General Studholme Hodgson while Admiral Augustus Keppel, already experienced in amphibious operations from his role in the Capture of Goree, was to command the naval elements. Campaign=First landing White dot: Location of Belle √éle in France. Red dot: Location of the city Le Palais on Belle √éle. The expedition was assembled at Plymouth and sailed on 29 March 1761. It arrived off Belle √éle, delayed by bad weather, on 6 April.Nelson, p. 27‚Äì28. After an initial reconnaissance of the southern end of the island it was decided to try the area around Port Andro on the south of Belle √éle. A force was landed under General John Craufurd which attempted to make a landing. A feint was made to the north with two battalions of infantry and a contingent of H.M. Marines (not Royal till 1802), in the hope of diverting attention from Crauford.Corbett, p. 162‚Äì63. Craufurd's force encountered much heavier opposition than had been expected. The French were well-entrenched and their fire took a heavy toll on the British attackers. A company of grenadiers managed to scale the nearby cliffs, but they were not supported and many were killed and captured. Realising that they had lost any chance of surprise, and apparently faced with little alternative, Craufurd's troops abandoned the attempt and withdrew back to the ships. A violent storm then blew up wrecking many of the landing craft vital for the operation. The expedition's commanders believed a further attempt was not practicable, and after further reconnaissance they wrote home to Pitt suggesting that no assault was now possible, raising the likelihood that the force should sail for home. The immediate results of the attack resulted in dismay in both Paris and London. The French court were infuriated by the fact that Pitt had pressed ahead with the operation in spite of the ongoing peace talks, which they regarded as an act of bad faith.Dull, p. 194. In Britain the failure was met with a mixture of resigned acceptance by opponents of the expedition, but Pitt pressed ahead with a second attempt. Troop transports carrying forces to take part in the attack on Martinique were diverted to join Keppel along with significant reinforcements.Corbett, p. 164. Pitt was determined to secure the island as a principal objective in the global war. Second landing Present day view of the Vauban style citadel at Le Palais. Augustus Keppel, the British naval commander Now reinforced, a second landing was planned by Keppel and Hodgson. After lengthy examination of the island's defences it was decided that the best chance of success was another attack at Port Andro. This time two diversionary attacks were planned to draw attention away from the main effort with one in the west against Sauzon and one in the north against St Foy.Corbett, p. 164‚Äì65. On 22 April the main attack, again led by John Crauford, met equally heavy opposition as it had last time and soon stalled. Meanwhile, the diversionary attack to the north led by Brigadier Hamilton Lambart discovered the stretch of coast around St Foy undefended by troops as the French had believed that the high cliffs were a strong enough defence against any attack. Lambart decided that they could be scaled, and his troops successfully gained a position on top of the ridge. They beat off a counter- attack from nearby French troops, receiving support from nearby Royal Navy ships.Corbett, p. 165‚Äì66. Realising what had happened, Crauford abandoned his attack and took his troops via boat around to assist Lambart. The British commanders poured further reinforcements in to secure the beachhead. By nightfall the whole British force was ashore. According to a pre-arranged signal the French forces and inhabitants withdrew into the main fortification at Le Palais leaving the rest of the island to the invaders.Corbett, p. 166‚Äì67. The British now occupied the island's defenceless ports allowing them to ship in fresh supplies, and began to besiege Le Palais. The French commander on the island, the Chevalier Sainte Croix, hoped that he would be able to resist at Le Palais long enough for some relief to reach him from the French mainland. The French Governor of Brittany, the Duc d'Aiguillon had gathered a force at Vannes with the intention of coming to the aid of Belle √éle, but British frigates kept a vigilant watch of the coast, and the British control of the surrounding seas made any chance of a crossing unlikely. The French government moved fresh reinforcements to mainland Brittany, suspecting that this would be the next target to be attacked.Corbett, p. 167‚Äì68. A French attempt to ready a small fleet by activating seven ships of the line at Rochefort and eight at Brest was encountered by an even more vigorous blockade mounted by Keppel.Corbett, p. 169‚Äì70. On 8 June after more than a month's siege of Le Palais, Sainte Croix acknowledged he was unlikely to receive any rescue and he agreed to capitulate. Sainte Croix was allowed, through convention, to march his men out through the breach with the honours of war and his force was then repatriated to nearby Lorient.Corbett, p. 167‚Äì170. British occupation During British rule there were three governors or administrators: John Craufurd The first governor was John Craufurd, who was born in 1722. son of Patrick Craufurd a merchant in Edinburgh. He commenced his duties on 24 December 1761. Taylor, pp. 316‚Äì323. Hamilton Lambart John Craufurd departed Belle Isle on 17 March 1762 and was replaced by Brigadier Hamilton Lambart, holding the post of \\"Senior Officer\\". James Forrester On 21 June 1762 Lt.Col.James Forrester arrived in the island and took up his position as governor, in place of Lambart. The Deputy Governor was Lt Col.Thomas Oswald, Commandant of 103rd Regiment of Foot (Volunteer Hunters), who had taken part, alongside the Royal Marines, in the capture of the island. The force was disbanded in England in 1763. In accordance with the terms of the Treaty of Paris (1763), which was ratified on 10 March 1763, Forrester handed over to Richard Auguste de Warren, who had been appointed French commander, on 10 May 1763.Taylor, p. 368. Forrester and the British forces departed Belle Isle the next day. Aftermath The initial French reaction to the island's fall was to tell the British they could keep it if they wanted, but could expect no compensation if they handed it back. It was soon realised that this was not a plausible stance, as the island could be used as a base for privateers and the Royal Navy. Ultimately after two years of occupation the island was handed back to France in the wake of the Treaty of Paris (1763), exchanged directly for the return of Menorca to Britain. Belle √éle was then partially settled by French-speaking Acadians expelled during the Great Expulsion of Acadians following the 1755 capture of the remaining portions of Acadia. The Acadians were unhappy with conditions there, and by 1785 most of them had emigrated to Louisiana.Griffiths, p. 122. ReferencesBibliography * Anderson, Fred.

Conceived as a subterranean rail line equivalent in capacity to the Parisian m√©tro, it will constitute a new relief line servicing the departments of Hauts-de-Seine, Val-de-Marne and Seine-Saint-Denis. It will enable direct transportation between the suburbs, bypassing Paris and thus avoiding transloading. It will be the longest tunnel for passenger traffic in the world.  History  The configuration of line 15 is very similar to that of the Arc Express, proposed by the RATP in 2006. It was later included in the red line project of the Grand Paris public transportation network, introduced by French President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2009. In March 2013, the \\"New Grand Paris\\" project was announced by the Prime Minister at the time, Jean-Marc Ayrault. At this time, the line acquired its current line 15 naming. Since August 2013, the New Grand Paris steering committee has met each trimester. The first public inquiry, focused on the southern section from Pont-de-S√®vres to Noisy‚ÄìChamps, was held from October to mid-November, 2013.  Proposed timeline  In 2013, the government led by Ayrault proposed the following implementation timeline for the line 15 project: * During 2014: Public inquiry on the eastern section from Saint-Denis Pleyel to Champigny Centre. * Early-2015: Groundbreaking of the southern section spanning Pont-de-S√®vres to Noisy‚ÄìChamps. * During 2020: Groundbreaking of the segments from Pont-de- S√®vres to Nanterre and from Saint-Denis Pleyel to Rosny-Bois-Perrier of the northern section. * 2022: Southern section from Pont-de-S√®vres to Noisy ‚Äì Champs put into service. * Early-2025: Segments from Pont-de-S√®vres to Nanterre and from Saint-Denis Pleyel to Rosny-Bois-Perrier of the northern section put into service. * During 2025: Groundbreaking of the segment from Nanterre to Saint-Denis Pleyel via La D√©fense-Grande-Arche of the northern section. * Early-2030: Segment from Nanterre to Saint-Denis Pleyel via La D√©fense-Grande-Arche of the northern section put into service. * End of 2030: Northern section from Rosny to Champigny put into service.

Cork to blame for premature Burgundy oxidation says Coates until 2002. There have also been reports of premature oxidation occurring in wines from Australia, Alsace, Germany, and Bordeaux. Hypotheses Clive Coates, MW has stated that \\"Poorly-performing corks are the main culprits behind prematurely aged white Burgundy\\", while Pierre Rovani of The Wine Advocate has stated the contrary, \\"corks are not the issue\\". Allen Meadows has speculated that \\"based on what we know today, the most likely source of the problem is cork-related, though it appears this has been exacerbated by generally lower levels of SO2\\", while Steve Tanzer believes it to be a combination of several factors that involve corks, global warming resulting in overripe fruit, excessive stirring of the lees, and insufficient use of sulfur dioxide. Roger Boulton, professor of UC Davis, agreed with the probability of multifactorial causality, stating, \\"there are likely to be both closure issues and wine chemistry issues, so looking for the [single] answer will be like missing the bus\\". The French oenologists Denis Dubourdieu and Val√©rie Lavigne-Cruege launched a theory that with the recent trends of abstaining from the use of herbicides and letting grass grow freely in the vineyards of Burgundy, the grass competing with vines for water in conjunction with a warm vintage may cause the vines to endure extreme stress. As a result, grapes grown on highly stressed vines may have insufficient quantities of glutathione, a compound that functions as an essential antioxidant during the fermentation process. According to Michel Bettane, Burgundy producers reacted by taking steps to address the possible causes by heightened scrutiny of cork quality, more awareness of possible sulfur dioxide insufficiency, and a decrease of the practice of batonnage, the stirring of the lees that adds richness to the wines but also increases oxygen contact. In December 2006, Jamie Goode published an analysis of the problem of premature oxidation in The World of Fine Wine and explores some possible solutions.

Drug harm comparison  In 2010, DrugScience produced a ranking of drug harms in the UK, the results of which garnered significant media attention. Drugs were assessed on two metrics ‚Äì harm to users and harms to society. The report found heroin, crack cocaine, and methamphetamine to be the most harmful drugs to individuals, with alcohol, heroin, and crack cocaine as the most harmful to others. Overall, alcohol was the most harmful drug, with heroin and crack cocaine in second and third places. Most notably, it found the legal status of most drugs bears little relation to the harms associated with them ‚Äì several class A drugs including ecstasy (MDMA), LSD and magic mushrooms featured at the very bottom of the list. Similar findings were found by a Europe-wide study conducted by 40 drug experts in 2015. A ranking of common recreational drugs in the UK ‚Äì assessed by harm to user and harm to society.

The report concluded that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than conventional cigarettes, advice which was subsequently used in a report by Public Health England on e-cigarettes and now forms part of the evidence-base for the positions of the UK Government and the National Health Service.

It was first observed in 2009 in the forests of Borneo, but due to limited information and the lack of a specimen for scientific study, it was not formally described or given a scientific name until 2019.Reuters. \\"Spectacled flowerpecker\\" bird found in Borneo, scientificamerican.com, 13 January 2010, accessed on 15 January 2010.Walton, Doreen, science reporter. New bird species found in rainforests of Borneo, BBC News, news.bbc.co.uk, 14 January 2010, accessed on 15 January 2010. Taxonomy and systematics Due to the difficulty in collecting a type specimen for research, the spectacled flowerpecker remained without a recognized scientific name for over a decade after its initial discovery. In January 2017, the Institute of Biodiversity and Environmental Research (IBER) at the Universiti Brunei Darussalam (UBD) issued a press release announcing their intention to capture, collect and formally name the spectacled flowerpecker by trapping a visiting flowerpecker at the Belalong Canopy walkway. However, no specimen was captured until 2019, when ornithologists Christopher Milensky and Jacob Saucier captured an individual in the Lanjak Entimau Wildlife Sanctuary in southwestern Borneo, miles from the areas where sightings of the bird were usually reported. Genetic analysis of the specimen found it to not only be a distinct species, but also not closely related to any of the other species in the genus Dicaeum. The specific epithet, dayakorum, is intended to honor the Dayak people, whose knowledge of the ecosystem is critical for conservation efforts in Borneo.  Description  The first bird sighted had prominent white arcs above and below the eyes, creating a broken eye-ring effect. The white throat was bordered by a diffuse dusky malar, merging into grey sides separated by a white stripe from the throat to the centre of the underparts. The upperparts were slate-grey. There were prominent, pure white pectoral tufts emerging from the carpal joints. The eyes, bill and legs were dark. A different bird seen on 20 June was less well marked, with paler grey plumage, less prominent eye-rings and pectoral tufts, and a less defined stripe down the breast, which, as well as the vent, was marked with a hint of yellow. Edwards et al. (2009) suggest that two adult individuals were seen, with the more strikingly marked bird the male and the less well-marked bird the female. The prominent broken white eye-rings suggested the use of the term \\"spectacled\\" for the common name. Vocalisation Vocalisations heard include two very short, hard flight-notes, similar to those made by the fire- breasted flowerpecker, when an individual alighted and departed. Also, a well- marked putative male bird singing, with a series of about 12 high-pitched see notes, rising and then falling in pitch.  Distribution and habitat  The new flowerpecker was first observed and photographed on 18 June 2009 by Richard Webster, a tropical ecologist, at the Borneo Rainforest Lodge within the Danum Valley Conservation Area, Sabah, Malaysia. Further sightings and photographs of more than one individual were made over the next two days by Webster, David Edwards from the University of Leeds, and Rose Ann Rowlett. The lodge is sited within unlogged tropical rainforest, 180 m asl at 5¬∞01‚Äô43‚ÄùN 117¬∞45‚Äô5‚ÄùE. The sightings were made from an observation platform on a suspended walkway within the rainforest canopy. The height of the birds sighted was over 40 m above ground level. Subsequently, the spectacled flowerpecker has been photographed at the Maliau Basin in Sabah, Labi Road and the Belalong Canopy Walkway in Brunei and in Central Kalimantan. Recent sightings and photographs indicate that it is a regular visitor to the Belalong Canopy Walkway in the Ulu Temburong National Park, Brunei Darussalam. The type specimen was captured in Lanjak Entimau Wildlife Sanctuary, Malaysia, where the species is not previously known from. Behaviour and ecology=Feeding When first observed the birds at Danum Valley In Sabah were feeding in a fruiting epiphytic mistletoe that was parasitising a large Koompassia excelsa tree. Other species of flowerpecker seen visiting the same mistletoe included the yellow-breasted, yellow-rumped, yellow-vented and orange-bellied flowerpeckers. A bird photographed by Hanyrol H Ahmad Sah from the Belalong Canopy Walkway in Brunei was feeding on the ripe orange berries of an epiphytic Medinilla plant at canopy level. At Bukit Batikap in Central Kalimantan, spectacled flowerpeckers have been observed feeding on Viscum mistletoes berries. Ecology Edwards et al. (2009) speculate that the spectacled flowerpecker is a rainforest canopy specialist, relying on ephemeral epiphytic fruits such as mistletoes, being highly mobile and rarely, if ever, visiting the understory of the forest - explaining why the new species remained undetected for so long.

Essen's only daughter, Alexandrine Essen (1816‚Äì1868), married count Pontus von Stenbock-Fermor (1806‚Äì1866) in 1835, at which point they began using the joint name Essen-Stenbock-Fermor. Career Essen enlisted as a sergeant in the Life Cuirassier Regiment in 1787, and transferred to the Pavlovsky heir battalion in 1790. He received promotions through the ranks, and in 1796 was promoted to lieutenant and transferred to the Life Guards Izmailovskiy Regiment. In 1796 he was promoted to colonel and in 1798 was promoted to major-general, and became head of the Vyborg musketeer regiment. He was promoted to lieutenant general in 1800. In August 1800, Essen was appointed military governor of Vyborg, Finland, and chief of the garrison of the Gorchakov [Vyborg] regiment. In 1802 he was appointed head of the Vyborg and Shlisselbourg musketeer regiments. In 1807 he was awarded the Order of St. George, third class, for his actions in the Battle of Eylau. Essen headed the 8th, 27th, and 4th Infantry Divisions of the army during 1816 and 1817, and was appointed military governor of Orenburg in 1817, and was appointed manager of the civil part of the province. In 1819, he was made a general of infantry. From 1830 to 1842 he served as military governor-general of St. Petersburg and a member of the State Council.

He was a Liberal member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, representing Mosman from 1984 to 1991 and North Shore from 1991 to 1993. Early life Smiles was born in Mosman, and attended local public schools. He then studied at the University of Sydney, where he received a Bachelor of Law and a Bachelor of Economics; at the University of New South Wales, where he received a Master of Business Administration, and Sydney Teachers College, where he received a Diploma of Education. He was employed as a marketing and management consultant before entering parliament. Political career In 1984, the state member for the safe Liberal seat of Mosman, David Arblaster, retired. Smiles contested the preselection but was opposed by the local mayor, Dom Lopez. Smiles was successful, and went on to defeat Lopez (running as an independent) in the election. In 1991, his seat was abolished, and he contested North Shore and defeated the Independent member, Robyn Read. He became the first Liberal to represent North Shore; it had been held by independents since its creation even though it had originally been created as an ultra-safe Liberal seat. He was briefly Assistant Treasurer from 1991 to 1992. However, his career imploded after he tried to claim his nannies as a tax deduction. He claimed that his nannies did secretarial work for him, but they testified under oath that they had done nothing of the sort. In 1993, he was convicted of tax evasion and fined $30,000 in what was dubbed the \\"Nannygate\\" case in the Australian press. As a result, he was forced to resign from parliament. He was investigated by the New South Wales parliament. Smiles was acquitted on appeal, but the court did not find him innocent and thus refused to order the Tax Office to foot his legal bills. Smiles then sued his accountant, Ted Moon, claiming that Moon's advice had led him to try to claim his nannies as a deduction. In 2003, the Supreme Court not only found in Moon's favour, but ordered Smiles to pay Moon's legal costs of close to $700,000. On 6 June 2005, registrar Sue McIllhatton declared him bankrupt, in part because he hadn't paid Moon a single cent of what he was owed.

A part of the Restoration Movement, the Connexion sponsored the publishing of the Herald of Gospel Liberty, which has been claimed as the world's oldest religious newspaper.

History of the City of Dayton and Montgomery County, Ohio. Vol. 1. Chicago and Dayton: Clarke, 1900. In the same year, the association bought a building in downtown Dayton, but ultimately found it unsatisfactory, and after more than ten years of operation from rented quarters, the association purchased another piece of land for $28,000. Construction began soon after the real estate was sold, and by the time that it was completed in June 1905, more than $100,000 had been spent on the building and its equipment. Twenty years later, the association arranged for the construction of the present property on Ludlow Street, which they only occupied for eleven years before moving in 1936. Architecture Designed by the Dayton architectural firm of Schenck & Williams, the Graphic Arts Building is a composite structure: while the foundation is concrete and the roof asphalt, the walls mix brick, concrete, and glass, while peripheral elements are made of marble, limestone, and other kinds of stone., Ohio History Connection, 2015. Accessed 2015-12-24. The extensive use of concrete was the result of structural demands: it was used in order to support the weight of the company's printing machinery and materials storage, as well as to render the five-story building fireproof. Although the sides are largely windowless, the front features five large multi-pane windows on each floor above ground level; they were placed in order to permit the entrance of substantial quantities of sunlight. Preservation In August 2009, the Ohio State Historic Preservation Office nominated the Graphic Arts Building for addition to the National Register of Historic Places. At the time, the owner had announced his opposition to having the building named a historic site, but his objection was dropped within months, as the building was added to the Register in November 2009. It qualified for inclusion both because of its historically significant architecture and because of the place it had played in local history.

He was a Liberal member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, representing the electorates of Bligh from 1984 to 1988 and Vaucluse from 1988 to 1994. Yabsley was born in Lismore, and attended private schools in the area. He attended the Australian National University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts with a double major in political science. He went on to work as a public relations manager for the Livestock and Grain Producers Association. On 5 November 1983, he married Susan Clatworthy, with whom he had two children. As a young man, at the age of 24 Yabsley was a candidate for the 1980 federal election for Fraser in the Australian Capital Territory for the Liberal Party. However he was defeated by Labor's Ken Fry. In 1984, Yabsley defeated Labor MP Fred Miller to win the NSW state seat of Bligh in Sydney for the Liberal Party. However, in 1988 he was defeated by Independent candidate Clover Moore. The death of Ray Aston, the Liberal member for Vaucluse, allowed Yabsley to re-enter parliament; he was elected unopposed in the by-election. He was immediately made Minister for Corrective Services, and in 1991 was promoted to Minister for State Development and Tourism. He left the ministry in 1992 and resigned from parliament in 1994. Yabsley resigned from the ministry in protest about the circumstances that brought the resignation of Premier Nick Greiner and Environment Minister Tim Moore forced upon by the three independents who held the balance of power. One of those independents was Clover Moore who had ousted him in Bligh at the 1988 election. The presence of the independents in Parliament would also be a factor to his eventual resignation from Parliament.

Dr. Arntzen's research focus spans plant cell-molecular biology and protein engineering. He was an early proponent of using plant biotechnology to enhance food quality and value, to express pharmacologically active products in plants, and to overcome health and agricultural constraints in the developing world. He is a pioneer in the development of plant-based vaccines for human disease prevention with special emphasis on needs of poor countries and disease prevention in animal agriculture. After 2001, this research was extended to the creation of effective vaccines and therapeutics to reduce the threats of biowarfare agents. Research initiated at ASU and funded by the US Army in 2002 focused on use of tobacco to bio-manufacture vaccines and monoclonal antibodies to prevent for treat disease caused by potential biowarefare agents. In 2011, he and his team at the Biodesign Institute were developing a vaccine for the Ebola virus using mice. An outcome of this research was the creation of ZMapp, a therapeutic used to treat Ebola patients. ZMapp remains as the leading candidate therapeutic for this disease. Fast Company chose him as the Most Creative Person in Business in 2015 for his work on fighting Ebola with tobacco-made therapeutics. In addition to his employment with DuPont, Dr. Arntzen's private sector service includes past membership on the Board of Directors of DeKalb Genetics Corporation (prior to sale to Monsanto) and Board of Directors for Axis Genetics in Cambridge, UK.

Life Consort Yu's birth date is unknown and there are two accounts of her origin. The first said she was from Yanji Town (È°èÈõÜÈïá) in Shuyang County, while the other claimed that she was from Suzhou, but both pointed that she was born in present-day Jiangsu. In 209 BC, Xiang Yu and his uncle Xiang Liang started a revolution to overthrow the Qin dynasty. Consort Yu's elder brother, Yu Ziqi (ËôûÂ≠êÊúü), was serving in Xiang Liang's army as a general then. Consort Yu met Xiang Yu, fell in love with him and became his wife. Since then, she had been following Xiang Yu on his military campaigns and refused to remain behind. She accompanied him on all battles.The China Journal - Volume 3, Issue 2 - Page 374 Arthur de Carle Sowerby - 1925 In 202 BC, Xiang Yu was besieged in the Battle of Gaixia by the combined forces of Liu Bang (King of Han), Han Xin and Peng Yue. The Han army started to sing folk songs from Xiang Yu's native land of Chu to create a false impression that they had captured Chu. The morale of Xiang Yu's troops plummeted and several soldiers deserted. In despair, Xiang Yu indulged in alcohol and sang the Song of Gaixia to express his sorrow. Consort Yu performed a sword dance and sang a verse in return. To prevent Xiang Yu from being distracted by his love for her, Consort Yu committed suicide with Xiang Yu's sword after singing.

The park is named after Basaseachic Falls (Cascada de Basaseachic) the second tallest waterfall in Mexico with a height of 246 meters (853 ft). Basaseachic Falls empties into Candame√±a Canyon (Barranca de Candame√±a) which was carved by the Basaseachic River over millions of years. The park is known for its pine-oak forest, rock formations, and scenic views from high cliffs. Cliffs in the park reach an impressive height of 1,640 meters (5,380 ft). History Basaseachic Falls were discovered by Europeans sometime in the 18th century, becoming one of the most popular tourist attraction of the state of Chihuahua. The area of the present-day national park was inhabited by Tarahumara prior to the Spanish Colonial period. The etymology of the name \\"Basaseachic\\" originates from the Tarahumara language, Rar√°muri meaning \\"place of the waterfall\\". The first known European settlement in the area was Misi√≥n de Tomochi near the town of Cajurichi which was under the legal jurisdiction of the mission. After the 18th century, the area attracted many settlers because of the discovery of abundant natural resources like minerals and high- quality wood. Basaseachic Falls National Park was created by the Mexican federal government on February 2, 1981, by decree under president Jose Lopez Portillo. The park was defined to 5,803 hectares (14,340 acres) in the Sierra Madre Occidental along the surrounding area of the Basaseachic Falls and Barranca de Candame√±a. Geography The park is located in the subdivision of the Sierra Madre Occidental known as Sierra Tarahumara, near the municipality of Ocampo, Chihuahua. The dramatic topology was created by deep tectonic plate movements causing large fractures and rising rifts. The violent movement of the terrain resulted in deep canyons and high mountains. The present-day topology has been changed over thousands of years by wind erosion and the Basaseachic River. The vertically pronounced walls of the Candame√±a Canyon can reach a height of 1,640 meters (5,380 ft); Candame√±a Canyon is known as one of the deepest canyons in the Sierra Tarahumara. The park includes two rivers: Duraznos River and Basaseachic River; both rivers feed into Basaseachic Falls that empties into the Candame√±a Canyon finally ending in the Candame√±a River. Climate Winter snowfall in the Sierra Madre Occidental Copper Canyon The climate in the park changes depending on the elevation of the terrain. There are many microclimates in the park due to the different terrain. According to K√∂ppen climate classification the following climates occur in the park. *Under 700 meters (2,296 ft) above sea level: BSh Semi-arid climate with annual average minimum of 17 ¬∞C (63 ¬∞F) and maximum of 39 ¬∞C (103 ¬∞F). With a wet season in the late summer and fall. *From 700-1,300 meters (2,296-4,265 ft) above sea level: Cw'a Humid Subtropical climate with a high annual temperature reaching near 29 ¬∞C (84 ¬∞F) in the summer with a winter dry season mild temperatures rarely falling below 0 ¬∞C (32 ¬∞F). Monsoons come in the late summer and into the fall with an average 50 cm (20 in). *From 1,300-1,700 meters (4,265-7,218 ft) above sea level: Cfa Humid Subtropical climate has warm humid summers and an average summer temperature of 20 ¬∞C (68 ¬∞F). The summer average precipitation is 70 cm (28 in) mostly in the months of: July, August, and September. From November to March there are many rainstorms and snowstorms caused by high elevation and prominent cold fronts. Winter temperatures can reach a low of -16 ¬∞C (3 ¬∞F). *From 2,200-2,800 meters (7,217-9,186 ft) above sea level:Dfa Humid Continental climate has warm summers reaching a maximum temperature of 28 ¬∞C (82 ¬∞F) and summer lows of 10 ¬∞C (50 ¬∞F). Heavy rainstorms are observed from July to September. Winters are cold reaching a maximum low of -20 ¬∞C (-4 ¬∞F) and a maximum high of -8 ¬∞C (17 ¬∞F). During the winter months, many snowstorms are observed with typically 1 meter (~3 ft) of snow per season. *Over 2,800 meters (9,186 ft) above sea level: Dfb Humid Continental climate is found only in the extremely high elevations of the peaks of the Sierra Madre Occidental. Summers are cool with temperatures rarely reaching 25 ¬∞C (77 ¬∞F) and summer lows fall below 10 ¬∞C (50 ¬∞F) regularly. There are heavy rainstorms from June to October. Winters are very cold with maximum high reaching 0 ¬∞C (32 ¬∞F) and reaching a maximum low of -31 ¬∞C (-24 ¬∞F). Winter snowstorms with high winds are common and typically over 1 meter (~3 ft) of snow per season. Flora and fauna Chihuahua White Pine in the Sierra Madre Occidental during the winter. The park has a great diversity in flora found in Northern Mexico. One of the factors that allows the park to have such a great variety of flora is due to the large number of microclimates found in the park due to dramatic terrain. The flora in the park like that found throughout the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range varies with elevation. Pine (Pinus) and oak (Quercus) species are usually found at an elevation of 2,000 meters (6,560 ft) above sea level. The park contains 92 species of conifers and 76 species of oaks. A large number of flora species in the following genus are observed in the park: Pinus, Quercus, Ficus, Vachellia, Ipomoea, Acacia, Lysiloma, Bursera, Vitex, Tabebuia, Sideroxylon, Cordia, Fouquieria, Pithecellobium. The park also supports a large variety of fauna including a significant number of mammals, reptiles and birds. The mammals that can be found in the park include: Mexican fox squirrel (Sciurus nayaritensis), antelope jackrabbit (Lepus alleni), raccoon (Procyon lotor), hooded skunk (Mephitis macroura), wild boar (Sus scrofa), collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), cougar (Puma concolor). The three main species of reptiles found in the park are: Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum), rock rattlesnake (Crotalus lepidus), black-tail rattlesnake (Crotalus molossus). There is a great variety of birds observed in the park including: Mexican jay (Aphelocoma ultramarina), Steller's jay (Cyanocitta stelleri), acorn woodpecker (Melanerpes formicivorus), canyon towhee (Pipilo fuscus), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), broad-billed hummingbird (Cynanthus latirostris), Montezuma quail (Cyrtonyx montezumae), mountain trogon (Trogon mexicanus), turkey Vulture (Cathartes aura).

Growing to across, this species has a rounded pectoral fin disc with a pointed snout, and a wide band of dermal denticles over the back in adults. It closely resembles and is often confused for the much larger daisy stingray (D. margarita); both species are characterized by the presence of an enlarged, nacreous denticle in the middle of the back called a \\"pearl spine\\". The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) does not yet have enough information to assess the pearl stingray's conservation status, but it is likely that most of the historically reported fishery catches of the daisy stingray were in fact of this species. Taxonomy and phylogeny Prior to being described by Leonard Compagno and Tyson Roberts, in a 1984 paper for the Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences, the pearl stingray was generally lumped together with the daisy stingray in scientific literature, though its existence had been recognized since at least 1965. The specific epithet margaritella comes from the diminutive of the Latin word margarita, meaning \\"pearl\\", in reference to the smaller body and pearl spine sizes of this ray compared to the daisy stingray. The type specimen is a male across, from Mbode, Cameroon. In appearance, the pearl stingray resembles the daisy stingray and the Niger stingray (D. garouaensis), both also native to West Africa, suggesting that the three species are closely related. Lisa Rosenberger's 2001 phylogenetic analysis, based on morphology, found that the pearl stingray is the sister species of the sharpnose stingray (Himantura gerrardi), and that the two form a clade with the pale-edged stingray (D. zugei) and the smooth butterfly ray (Gymnura micrura). These results support the growing consensus that neither Dasyatis nor Himantura are monophyletic. The daisy and Niger stingrays were not included in the study. Distribution and habitat The pearl stingray is found along the western coast of Africa, from Cape Blanc in Mauritania to Angola. This bottom-dwelling species inhabits shallow, coastal marine and brackish waters, and has been reported from lagoons and estuaries, including the mouth of the Congo River. Description The pearl stingray has a moderately thin, oval-shaped pectoral fin disc about as long as wide. The narrow snout tapers to a point that protrudes somewhat from the disc. The eyes are immediately followed by the spiracles, which are of approximately equal size. There is a flap of skin between the nares with a weakly curved or lobed, fringed posterior margin; a pair of grooves run between this flap and the corners of the gently bow-shaped mouth. There are five papillae in a row across the floor of the mouth. There are 24-41 upper tooth rows and 34-50 lower tooth rows. The blunt, ridged teeth are arranged into pavements with a quincunx pattern; those of adult males are longer than those of females, but are not pointed. The pelvic fins are short and triangular with their tips projecting slightly beyond the disc margin. The tail is broad and flattened at the base and becomes thin and whip-like past the (usually) single, slender stinging spine on the upper surface. Past the spine, there is a low dorsal keel and a well-developed ventral fin fold. There is a medium-sized oval pearl spine in the middle of the back; rays over across also gain a band of small, heart-shaped or flattened circular dermal denticles covering the median third of the disc, from between the eyes to the base of the tail. The tail is covered by small prickles behind the spine. It is a plain grayish brown above, and completely white below. The smallest West African stingray, this species grows to across and a weight of . The pearl stingray differs from the daisy stingray in being much smaller, and having a relatively smaller, oval pearl spine, more tooth rows, and fewer pectoral fin radials (113-127 versus 129-136). Biology and ecology Little is known of the natural history of the pearl stingray. Like other stingrays, it is aplacental viviparous with females likely bearing litters of 1-3 pups. Sexual maturation occurs at a disc width of around . Human interactions Despite its small size, the pearl stingray is probably taken by \\"catch-all\\" commercial fisheries operating in coastal waters off Senegal, Ghana, C√¥te d'Ivoire, and elsewhere, using longlines, bottom trawls, and trammel nets. However, no specific utilization data is available as it was and continues to be combined with the daisy stingray in catch records. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient. Given that the pearl stingray was once (and may still be) much more abundant than the daisy stingray, it likely comprised a majority of historically reported \\"daisy stingray\\" catches.

The novel also incorporates elements of contemporary fantasy, crime fiction, and Gothic fiction. It employs the third-person omniscient, nonlinear narrative in telling the story of Ig Perrish, who--in the aftermath of his girlfriend Merrin Williams' mysterious rape and murder--awakes one morning to find horns growing from his head and diabolical powers at his command. Plot summary The novel consists of fifty chapters grouped into five sections of ten chapters each, named as follows: Hell Twenty-six- year-old Ignatius \\"Ig\\" Perrish wakes up one morning after a drunken night (in the woods containing an old foundry, near where his girlfriend's corpse was discovered) to find that he has sprouted bony, sensitive horns from his temples. Ig is the second son of a renowned musician and the younger brother of a rising late-night TV star, Terry Perrish. Ig had position and security within his hometown of Gideon, New Hampshire, but the rape and murder of his girlfriend, Merrin Williams, changed all that. Despite his innocence, and although he was neither charged nor tried, Ig is largely considered guilty in public opinion. As Ig leaves the apartment he shares with his friend with benefits, Glenna Nicholson, he notices that she is strangely honest with him about her desire to binge, her feelings about his unwanted presence, and the fact that she performed oral sex on a mutual high school friend of theirs, Lee Tourneau, the previous night. As Ig goes to a medical clinic to deal with the growth of his horns, he discovers that people have a sudden compulsion to blatantly express their ugliest and most animalistic urges, desires, and opinions to him, and that no one (neither those whom he already knows nor those he meets for the first time) seems surprised to see the horns. Moreover, when he makes skin-to-skin contact with individuals, he immediately learns their identities and some of their darkest secrets. They forget about their conversations with him as soon as they're over, as well as forgetting about the horns. Ig also realizes that he can make people give in to the ugly urges they have--in fact, the horns pulse in a pleasurable fashion when he does so-- but he cannot make them do things they do not already want to do. He experiences these revelations with the doctor he talks to, two previously acquainted police officers, his church's priest and a nun, and others he encounters. Going home, he discovers that his parents and grandmother detest him and believe him to be Merrin's killer; he then meets his brother, Terry, who seems to be the only sympathetic member of the Perrish family. Under the influence of the horns' power, Terry confesses that he knows who killed Merrin: Ig's childhood best friend, Lee Tourneau. Ig, in an episode of diabolic passion, releases the brake on his grandmother's wheelchair, and she goes rushing down a slope at a precarious speed. Cherry The high school past of Ig and Terry Perrish, Merrin Williams, and Lee Tourneau is explored, with the cherry as a common motif, referring to Merrin's red hair, the loss of virginity, and the characters' involvement with cherry bombs. Ig agrees to a bet: if he rides a shopping cart naked down a perilous trail in the woods by the Knowles River, he will receive a cherry bomb. Although he breaks his nose and briefly loses consciousness when he crashes into the river, Ig survives, believing that Lee Tourneau pulled him out of the water and resuscitated him. Ig and Lee immediately become friends, though Ig is pestered by the uncomfortable feeling of owing Lee a debt. In church, Ig becomes infatuated with a red-headed girl who has been flirtatiously reflecting light off her cross necklace into his eyes. When the necklace breaks and, unnoticed by her, falls down, Ig collects it and decides to impress her by fixing it. But when Lee expresses an interest in her and shows him how to fix the necklace, Ig lets him have it instead. Later, Ig trades his cherry bomb with Lee in order to get back the cross. With this, Ig greets Merrin and the two soon become de facto girlfriend and boyfriend. Lee detonates the cherry bomb and damages his eye, which becomes milky and has impaired vision, though his other eye is unimpaired. Lee is also revealed to be a juvenile delinquent, having stolen and sold various items, perhaps as a way of venting his seemingly groundless hatred of his mother. Ig feels not only that he may be responsible for Lee's accident, but that Merrin should not go to the hospital with him to visit Lee, because Ig thinks it would be tantamount to gloating in Lee's face (having won the girl over Lee). The Fire Sermon The night of Merrin's murder is partially revealed; specifically, the drunken argument between her and Ig in a restaurant (the last time they see each other). Merrin explains that Ig, who is about to go to England for six months for his job, should openly pursue other women while there, in order to gain some more romantic experience (Merrin being his only romance ever). Ig is infuriated, thinking (correctly) that she wishes to permanently end their relationship and suspecting she may have been cheating on him. He drives away from the restaurant, leaving her in the rain. Later, at the airport, he is about to board the plane when he is suddenly surrounded by police officers. In the present day, Ig goes to the congressman's office where Lee works and tells Lee he knows that Lee killed Merrin, but for some reason, he is unable to manipulate Lee with the horns. He also cannot attack Lee because of the congressman's security team, which includes Eric Hannity, another high school acquaintance. Ig drives back to the woods and the foundry and notices that snakes have started congregating around him. He listens to voice mails left by his friends and family on his cell phone and realizes that they think he is missing, having apparently not remembered just seeing him while under the mysterious influence of his horns. He drives back to his and Glenna's apartment where he is attacked by Eric, just narrowly escaping. Returning to his parents' home, Ig touches a sleeping Terry's wrist and suddenly sees, from Terry's perspective, the events of the night of Merrin's murder: Terry is riding in Lee's car when they pick up Merrin, but is drunk and high and passes out while the actual murder takes place; later, Lee convinces Terry to keep quiet and five months later, a guilt-ridden Terry unsuccessfully attempts suicide. Although Terry begins to wake up, Ig discovers another power of his--he can perfectly mimic other voices-- and convinces Terry that he is their mother, in the dark room, before departing. Ig returns to the foundry where he finds an affinity with fire (and wine) and delivers a speech to the snakes. He asserts that the devil and women have always caused fear in God, with women being the more powerful because they, like God, have the power of creation. He argues that when Merrin decided to break away from him to pursue her own ends, God detested her and refused to come to her aid while she was being raped and murdered, all because He feared a \\"woman's power to choose who and how to love, to redefine love as she sees fit.\\" God is a failed character too detested by his own creations to appreciate them. Ig concludes that only the devil loves humans for what they are, despite some of their negative characteristics. The following morning at the foundry, Ig is abruptly assaulted by Lee, and the contact with him enlightens Ig as to just how Lee murdered Merrin. Ig finds that Lee is wearing Merrin's cross and tears it off him, leaving Lee exposed to the horns' influence. Lee viciously beats Ig and tosses him in Ig's AMC Gremlin, douses the car with gasoline, and lights it on fire. Ig is able to release the parking brake, and the car, ablaze, rolls down into the river, in imitation of Ig's journey in the shopping cart years earlier. The fire, though reddening Ig's skin, has somehow completely restored him to physical health, healing the damage from his fight with Lee. There is another flashback with Merrin, regarding the time she and Ig visited a mysterious treehouse in the woods filled with religious paraphernalia. The two have sex and then pray when suddenly someone startles them by banging on the door in the floor of the treehouse. They quickly dress as the pounding continues, but when they open the door, no one is there. They are never able to relocate the tree house and begin to believe they both imagined it, dubbing it the \\"Treehouse of the Mind.\\" The Fixer Lee Tourneau's adult life (as a close associate of a Christian conservative congressman) and his sexual pursuit of Merrin is explored. His mother acquired dementia and became weak and confused. Lee uses this as an opportunity to torture her, while pretending to be a loving, caring son whenever anyone visits. Ultimately she dies, and he uses her death as an excuse to become close to Merrin. He consistently finds more meaning than is intended from Merrin's gestures and choice of words, believing her to be sexually interested in him and, knowing that Ig will soon be leaving for Britain, eager to begin an affair with her. In reality she means no such thing. Lee also remembers an experience from his childhood in which he attempted to feed and befriend a stray cat, only to be swatted at, causing him to fall from a fence and hit his head; he is impaled in the head by the spike of a pitchfork and is severely brain damaged; he undergoes a hallucination in which he perceives things as God would, and murders the cat. When he returns, his mother perceives nothing wrong, not investigating the cause of but rather only reprimanding him for his blood stained pillow cases. It appears that from this point in time, his personality is changed and he has psychopathic thoughts. The section concludes with Lee's realization that Merrin never wanted a relationship with him, and his decision to rape and kill her. The Gospel According to Mick and Keith Ig is fully healed by the flames, but his clothes have burned off. Naked, he finds an old skirt and black overcoat to wear in the woods. He scoops up Merrin's cross and sees Dale Williams, Merrin's father, among a small crowd that has formed near the burnt car. Dale, against his will, gives Ig a ride to the Williams house, and the two discuss their conflicts and the death of Regan Williams, Merrin's older sister, from breast cancer, long before Ig and Merrin ever met. Ig has a strange impulse to go the Williams' attic, seemingly having visions of the Treehouse of the Mind and its similar trap door. In the attic, Ig finds a group of papers written in Morse code and a mammogram that reveals that Merrin too had breast cancer. Ig deciphers the Morse code to read a note written to him by Merrin, who describes her feelings about knowing she will die from breast cancer; she encourages him to find another romantic partner, though she loves him; she says she believes in the gospel of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, quoting from The Rolling Stones song \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want.\\" It turns out she had decided she didn't want chemo, but she knew if she stayed with Ig, he would find out she had cancer and for love of him, she'd have chemo anyway. So she decided to break up with him and die on her own, to save him pain. Ig reunites with Glenna, whom he convinces to lead a more fulfilling life, and when she accidentally leaves her cell phone, Ig uses it to call Lee and, mimicking Glenna's voice, persuades him to drive to the foundry, where Ig hopes to ambush and kill him. Terry unexpectedly arrives at the foundry, confessing that he has quit his TV job, though Ig begs that he flee. Lee's car arrives, and both Lee and Eric exit the vehicle, armed with guns and aware of Ig's trap, having talked to the real Glenna. Ig and Eric struggle for a time before Lee shoots and kills Eric, hoping that it will look as though Ig and Eric killed each other, without Lee's involvement. Lee then gorily beats Ig with the empty shotgun until Terry reappears, blasting his trumpet into Lee's ear. With this distraction, Ig finally slams his horns into Lee's body. He then telepathically convinces a snake to slide down Lee's throat, finishing him off. As Terry goes to use Glenna's phone to call emergency services, he is bitten by a venomous snake that Ig had placed there to attack Lee. Desperately, the gruesomely injured Ig crawls over to a gasoline canister, hoping that he can light himself on fire quick enough to restore his diabolic flesh and get Terry to a hospital. As he prepares to self-immolate, Ig begins to remember in hazy flashback his activities of the night he was drunk the morning before he awoke to discover the horns: in his inebriated state, he miraculously came across the elusive Treehouse of the Mind and while knocking on the trap door, discovered that he was the one the younger versions of himself and Merrin had heard knocking on the door all along. The night before he grew horns, he climbed into it and set it on fire. The treehouse had rules written on a piece of parchment: \\"TAKE WHAT YOU WANT WHILE YOU'RE HERE/GET WHAT YOU NEED WHEN YOU LEAVE.\\" He needed to kill the person who murdered Merrin, he felt, and began to feel a tingling near his temples (implying that this desire would later cause him to become devil-like). Back in the present time, Ig is restored to health by the flames and tells Terry that he needs to lie about what has happened here; Eric and Lee are both dead, and Terry needs to believe that Ig died too. Ig then goes to the cherry tree that once held the Treehouse of the Mind to find that a line of fire has reached it from the foundry. The treehouse itself has reappeared beyond the flames and Ig climbs up into the burning tree, enters the treehouse, and finds a wedding party within and Merrin awaiting him. Sometime later, Terry is recuperating from his snakebite, believing (thanks to the influence of Ig's horns) that Eric and Lee killed Ig by burning him in his car, and that the two then tortured Terry with a venomous snake, before they killed each other. Although the detective doubts that this story is true, Terry is the only living witness. Terry goes to the woods to have some peace of mind and is joined by Glenna. When she leaves to begin packing for her move to New York City, Terry believes he can hear the faint sound of a trumpet, and decides it is time for him to leave too. The inner front and back cover of the book has a repeating message written in morse code. It reads, \\"Pleased to meet you; hope you guess my name,\\" which are lyrics from the Rolling Stones song, \\"Sympathy for the Devil.\\" It refers to the novel's themes that the devil is more of an anti-hero than a villain. Background Approximately a decade ago, Hill wrote an epic fantasy novel entitled The Fear Tree... that involved a character with the ability to divine people's most closely guarded secrets. This concept was reworked for a novel Hill wrote entitled The Surrealist's Glass, wherein the protagonist acquired a magical lens which allowed him to see people's secrets. Hill describes The Surrealist's Glass \\"as a confused, corrupt, first draft of Horns\\" to the degree that \\"several scenes in Horns appeared in a cruder earlier form in [The Surrealist's] Glass.\\" According to Hill, \\"writers tend to revisit the same themes, tropes, places, and concerns, again and again, until they figure out how to use them in a satisfying way,\\" which is what he did with this premise until he \\"finally got it right with Horns.\\" Reception Horns was nominated for the 2010 Bram Stoker Award for Best Novel. Film adaptation On June 16, 2012, it was announced via Joe Hill's personal website that Mandalay Pictures and Red Granite Pictures would be making Horns, with Alexandre Aja directing, Daniel Radcliffe starring as Ignatius Perrish and Juno Temple as Merrin Williams. Horns premiered at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival and its US theatrical release was on October 31, 2014. Horns grossed a total of $3,347,106 worldwide in 31 days of release.

Social corporatism is a major component of the Nordic model and to a lesser degree the West European social market economies. It is considered a compromise to regulate the conflict between capital and labour by mandating them to engage in mutual consultations that are mediated by the government. Generally supported by nationalist and/or social-democratic political parties, social corporatism developed in the post-World War II period, influenced by Christian democrats and social democrats in European countries such as Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. Social corporatism has also been adopted in different configurations and to varying degrees in various European countries. The Nordic countries have the most comprehensive form of collective bargaining, where trade unions are represented at the national level by official organizations alongside employers' associations. Together with the welfare state policies of these countries, this forms what is termed the Nordic model. Less extensive models exist in Austria and Germany which are components of Rhine capitalism.  Overview  Some controversy has existed in the political left over social corporatism, where it has been criticized for abandoning the concept of class struggle in favour of class collaboration and compromise, legitimizing privately owned enterprise and for lending credence to a form of regulated capitalism. Others on the left counter these criticisms by claiming that social corporatism has been progressive in providing institutional legitimacy to the labour movement that recognizes the existence of ongoing class conflict between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, but they seek to provide peaceful resolutions to disputes arising from the conflict based on moderation rather than revolution. Proponents of social corporatism consider it a class compromise within the context of existing class conflict. In the 1930s, social democracy was labeled social fascism by the Communist International which maintained that social democracy was a variant of fascism because in addition to their shared corporatist economic model they stood in the way of transitioning to communism and socialism. The development of social corporatism began in Norway and Sweden in the 1930s and was consolidated in the 1960s and 1970s. The system was based upon the dual compromise of capital and the labour as one component and the market and the state as the other component. Social corporatism developed in Austria under the post-World War II coalition government of the Social Democratic Party of Austria and the Austrian People's Party. Social corporatism in Austria protects private property in exchange for allowing the labour movement to have political recognition and influence in the economy‚Äîto avoid the sharp class conflict that plagued Austria in the 1930s. J. Barkley Rosser and Marina V. Rosser wrote: > Liberal corporatism is largely self-organized between labor and management, > with only a supporting role for government. Leading examples of such systems > are found in small, ethnically homogeneous countries with strong traditions > of social democratic or labor party rule, such as Sweden's Nordic neighbors. > Using a scale of 0.0 to 2.0 and subjectively assigning values based on six > previous studies, Frederic Pryor in 1988 found Norway and Sweden the most > corporatist at 2.0 each, followed by Austria at 1.8, the Netherlands at 1.5, > Finland, Denmark, and Belgium at 1.3 each, and Switzerland and West Germany > at 1.0 each.

In the December 15, 1845 edition of the Witness, Dougall explained why he began his paper. Society needed a general religious and literary newspaper. His friends in various evangelical denominations assisted him in making the Witness a reality. The Journal intended to \\"witness for the truth in love.\\" Dougall planned to focus on such topics as Christian Union, Missions, Education, the Efforts of Religious and Benevolent Societies, Public and Social Improvements, Immigration, and Cheap Postage. The Witness would lend its influence for the development of Canada's resources.Montreal Witness, December 15, 1845, p. 1 Dougall's newspaper presented a variety of information. In the December 15, 1845 edition the lead article was entitled, \\"The History of the Reformation in the Sixteenth Century\\" by Dr. Merle D‚ÄôAugbigne. This was followed by articles entitled, \\"Sabbath School Teaching\\" (a sermon); \\"Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation,\\" ( a reprint from the Edinburgh Witness of the ‚ÄòInfidel‚Äô work). Some of the articles were of general interest such as \\"The Fruit Trees of America,\\" (An extract from the book by A. J. Downing mostly about 'The Apple.' The Witness also reported the news, sometimes with extensive commentary while other items were mentioned just briefly. The news of the December 15, 1845 paper included: a lengthy report of the 'Liverpool Conference on Christian Union', 'Partial Failure of the Crops', Railway Mania (Difficulties in the railway business), 'The War in Algiers', 'The New German Reformation', and 'The President‚Äôs Message' (re: Canada/USA relations and the Oregon dispute). There were sections for letters to the editor, birth and death announcements, etc.Montreal Witness, December 15, 1845 By 1886, the Montreal Witness, was known as \\"the only religious daily.\\" It was published as an evening newspaper. According to Argyll, the Witness wielded a powerful influence among the Protestant population of Montreal and the province of Quebec. It was respected by all classes and creeds in the community and was noted as a strong supporter of the temperance movement. Its circulation was said to be between fourteen and fifteen thousand daily.Argyll, John Douglas Sutherland Campbell (1886). Industries of Canada: city of Montreal: historical and descriptive review, leading firms and moneyed institutions (Google eBook). Montreal, Historical Pub. Co. p. 99  The Witness and the Temperance Movement  Letitia Youmans of Picton, Ontario mentioned that the Montreal Witness was one of their home papers in 1850. She said the Witness consistently supported the temperance cause.* p. 92  The Protestant/Catholic Divide  The newspaper was intentionally Protestant. Its opposition to the teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic Church were often frank and undiplomatic. For example, John Dougall persisted in blaming the mayor of Montreal, Charles Wilson, for the Gavazzi Riots. In the December 15, 1845 edition, one letter to the editor expressed intense anti-Roman Catholic sentiment. In the 1870s, the Montreal Witness published the lectures of Father Chiniquy, a Canadian Catholic priest who left the Catholic Church and became a Protestant. Chiniquy credits the owner of the Montreal Witness, John Dougall, for helping him make the transition. In response to Chiniquy's lectures appearing in the Witness, on March 26, 1875, the Catholic Church forbade the reading of the Montreal Witness.New York Times, March 27, 1875, The reading by Catholics of the Montreal Witness forbidden The Bishop of Montreal issued a pastoral letter endorsed by the Archbishop of Quebec.

Description Pteraeolidia ianthina, one of the most common aeolids found, is often called a \\"blue dragon\\" by Eastern Australian divers because of its close resemblance to a Chinese dragon.http://www.philippine-seaslugs.com/AEOLIDINA/Pteraeolidia_ianthina.htm Pteraeolidia ianthina It is one of the most common aeolid nudibranchs found in Eastern Australia, and can inflict a painful sting to humans. The body color of this species is translucent tan, but the cerata, which vary from dark purple to lavender to golden brown, give the nudibranch most of its distinct color. Green specimens are not uncommon. The slug is elongated () with many clusters of medium-large sized cerata along the length of the body. The fat rhinophores and the long cephalic tentacles have at least two dark purple bands that stand out. The tips of the cerata contain nematocysts. Algal zooxanthellae of the genus Symbiodinium derived from the food of these animals continue to photosynthesise inside the body and give rise to brown and green pigments. Symbiodinium, together with the nematocysts, are presumed to be derived from coelenterate prey. These Symbiodinium occur within vacuoles in host cells derived from the endoderm.Sutton & Hoegh-Guldberg, Host- Zooxanthella Interactions in Four Temperate Marine Symbioses; Assessment of Effect of Host Extract on Symbionts; The Biological bulletin, Marine Biological Laboratory (Woods Hole, Mass.). v. 178 (1990) p. 175 Young specimens are much shorter, have fewer cerata, and are often mistaken for other nudibranch species.Cory Pittman and Pauline Fiene, 2015. Pteraeolidia semperi Sea slugs of Hawaii Symbiosis with dinoflagellates This sea slug feeds on hydroids which contain Symbiodinium, microscopic dinoflagellates that are photosynthetic. The microscopic Symbiodinium acquired from the hydroids are 'farmed' in the sea slug's digestive diverticula, where the Symbiodinium photosynthesizes sugars to be used by the slug. The slug gains enough photosythetically derived sugars to sustain it without feeding. ReferencesFurther reading * Rudman, W. B.

Biography Sarma was born in 1867 to Bayya Mahadeva Sastry, a Velandu Vaidik Brahmin inamdar in Visakhapatnam, Madras Presidency, now in Andhra Pradesh and had his early education in the Hindu High School, Visakhapatnam. He graduated with first class in his B.A from the Rajahmundry Government College, then under Madras University. He won the Metcalfe scholarship for his academic ability. Narasimheswara Sarma studied law at Madras University and joined the Congress during its Madras session in 1887. He began his career as a lawyer as a member of the Visakhapatnam bar in 1891. He was municipal chairman of Visakhapatnam twice and he did good work to improve the town. As a result of his success in public life, he was nominated to the council of the presidency of Madras in 1906 and developed a keen interest in politics. He was responsible for the Madras The Land Estates Act (1908), which gave rights to tenant farmers in estates and streamlined estate and inam revenue administration. He was the first president of the Andhra Mahasabha held at Bapatla in 1913. In 1914 he went to London as a member of a Congress delegation along with Jinnah, S.Sinha, Lajpat Rai, Mazhar- ul- Haque and Samarth, where he delivered speeches in Kensington hall and also spoke before groups of British parliamentarians appraising them of Indian problems and the need for political reform. He quit active legal practice at a very young age as he felt it would be contradictory to his position in public life. He became a member of the imperial council in 1916. In 1918 he put forth a resolution in the imperial council recommending linguistic provinces . This was opposed vehemently, ironically by Jinnah. He was a champion of indianization of services and strove hard for the development of industry, agriculture and education and took great pains to develop a well regulated banking system in the country. He strove hard for the amelioration of indentured labor in Africa, Fiji, etc. He was considered one of the foremost authorities in land tenures, revenue and estate matters in the country. He stressed the need for the development of a national capital city and took great interest in the development of New Delhi. He fought with the British establishment for release of adequate funding for the development of Delhi, a fact acknowledged by Lutyens and Baker in their book Indian Summer. Narasimhesvara Sarma was a theosophist from his early days. However, in the beginning, he was opposed to Annie Besant. But when Besant launched the Home Rule Movement, he supported her. Sarma also joined the national education board set up by her . He co- authored with B.N. Basu the Memorandum of nineteen which put the Indian perspective of reforms to the government. He was a committed moderate in his political views and was conservative in his personal life to which many took affront. He was highly respected for his personal philanthropy and many institutions received benefactions from him. When the Montagu‚ÄìChelmsford Reforms were passed in 1919, Sarma differed from the Tilak group of Congressmen and Besant and supported the moderate view that the reforms were a step in the right direction and should be given a chance. He was one of the few members of the Indian Congress to give a speech in the Imperial Legislative Council supporting the reforms while still in the Congress, the other moderates already having left and formed the liberal party. He opposed the recall of Viceroy Lord Chelmsford, on behalf of the moderates for which he was criticized. He was made a member of the viceroy's executive council in 1920 from which he retired in 1925. He held the portfolios of revenue, agriculture, public works, finance and education during his tenure. His Indian colleagues in the council were sir T.B.Sapru and Sir Mohd. Shafi. He was knighted in the 1923 Birthday Honours List as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India (KCSI).London Gazette, 2 June 1923 In 1924 he was made president of the council of state. when the Andhra University was formed, he presided over its first general body meeting. He was also president of the railway rates commission, a post which he held till his death in 1932.

Waste laws are generally designed to minimize or eliminate the uncontrolled dispersal of waste materials into the environment in a manner that may cause ecological or biological harm, and include laws designed to reduce the generation of waste and promote or mandate waste recycling. Regulatory efforts include identifying and categorizing waste types and mandating transport, treatment, storage, and disposal practices.  Waste determination  Waste determination is the process by which a particular material is classified as a \\"waste\\" subject to regulation.E.g., U.S. EPA OSWER 5305W, Introduction to Hazardous Waste Identification (\\"'Is my waste a hazardous waste regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)?' This is one of the most common and basic RCRA questions and is the key to the RCRA hazardous waste program. The question can become quite complicated, as for example determining whether a some material is \\"hazardous waste\\" under the U.S. Resource Conservation and Recovery ActU.S. EPA OSWER 5305W, Introduction to Hazardous Waste Identification (Section 2, describing regulatory evaluation of whether a material is \\"solid waste,\\" if so whether it is specifically excluded from RCRA regulations, whether the waste is \\"listed\\" as hazardous, and whether the waste otherwise exhibits characteristics of hazardous waste). See also U.S. EPA, Definition of Solid Waste (DSW) Decision Tool v2. Determination of whether a material constitutes a particular waste type may govern the manner in which the material must be handled from that point forward. For example, in the United States, non-hazardous municipal solid waste may be sent to a landfill,U.S. EPA, Landfills while used motor oil is deemed hazardous and cannot be dumped in landfills, but rather is subject to more stringent handling, storage, treatment, and disposal requirements.RJS Management, Waste Disposal & Collection SolutionsU.S. EPA, Used Oil Management Program Laws & Regulations Many other wastes may have their own individual definitions and unique handling requirements. In each case a \\"waste stream\\" may be identified - waste is generated when a previously useful item is discarded or abandoned, and then may flow through various defined treatment, recycling, and storage areas before arriving at a final designated disposal site.U.S. EPA Terms of Environment, Waste Stream.  Disposal standards  Disposal standards govern the permissibility, method, and location of disposal of a particular waste. Such standards may be designed to protect human health and comfort, and environmental values. A variety of methods exist to control disposal. Waste disposal may be restricted entirely via a disposal ban. The most common and widespread such standard is a prohibition on littering. Where a jurisdiction has authorized a specific place or system for trash collection, deposition or abandonment of trash elsewhere may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.See, e.g., NCSL, List of States with Littering Penalties. Other more specific disposal bans - from mandating that paint not be poured down drains, to specifying national repositories for radioactive waste - all act to govern the final resting place of various wastes. Still other wastes may be required to be separated for recycling, rather than disposal. All of these prohibitions are, in a sense, conditional, in that they do not outright ban the disposal of the material, but rather restrict the disposal location. Waste disposal also may be restricted conditionally by requiring that a waste be treated in a specific fashion before it may be disposed of at a particular location. One such program is the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Land Disposal Restrictions under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Subtitle C hazardous waste management program.See 40 C.F.R. Part 268. These rules restrict the land disposal (placement in landfills, primarily) of hazardous waste without prior approved programs. The \\"disposal prohibition\\" mandates that hazardous waste cannot be disposed on land until it is treated to meet specified characteristics (acceptable ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, and toxicity), or is treated by specified approved treatment methods. The \\"dilution prohibition\\" proscribes adding large amounts of water, soil, or non-hazardous waste in order to avoid specified treatment. The \\"storage prohibition\\" allows waste to be stored only for the purposes of accumulating for treatment, rather than simply stored indefinitely to avoid treatment.U.S. EPA, http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/tsd/ldr/f99043.pdf Land Disposal Restrictions for Hazardous Wastes: A Snapshot of the Program . Specific standards may also be adopted regarding the construction and operation of waste disposal facilities. Landfills, for example, may be required to meet location restrictions to avoid geological faults or wetlands; to install liner systems and collection systems to minimize groundwater contamination from leachate; to adopt operation policies that minimize dust and other nuisances; to install methane removal or collection systems to eliminate landfill gas; to be covered and otherwise closed upon decommissioning; and to operate environmental monitoring systems to ensure compliance.See, e.g., U.S. EPA, Landfills.

Kov√°cs (Bonn, 2013), p. 82 he was a consul ordinarius in the year 176 with Marcus Flavius Aper as his colleague.G√©za Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand unter der Antoninen (Bonn: Rudolf Habelt Verlag, 1977), p. 190  Life  Pollio was born into a family of Patrician rank. Although the name of his mother is unknown, his father is Titus Vitrasius Pollio, consul around 137 in the reign of Hadrian.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 325 The older Pollio's paternal grandfather was Titus Vitrasius Pollio, who served as a Procurator of Egypt under Claudius (41-54) and whose father of the same name was also procurator of Egypt during the reign of Tiberius. Two inscriptions, one from Rome, the other from Leon, provides us the details of his cursus honorum. Pollio's career began in his teens as one of the tresviri monetalis, the most prestigious of the four boards that comprise the vigintiviri; assignment to this board was usually allocated to patricians or favored individuals.Anthony Birley, The Fasti of Roman Britain (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981), pp. 4f His next office was as a quaestor, and upon completion of this traditional Republican magistracy Pollio would be enrolled in the Senate. As a patrician, Pollio was ineligible to hold the office of plebeian tribune, and was excused from serving as an aedile, so his next office was the traditional Republican magistracy of praetor. At this point, he acceded to the suffect consulship almost automatically after reaching his thirty-second or thirty-third birthday. By this point in his life Pollio had been admitted to the sodales Antoniniani. Upon stepping down from the consulate, Pollio received a series of imperial appointments. First was curator aquarum, or overseer of the aqueducts of Rome. Next he served as a legatus or governor of Moesia Inferior; G√©za Alf√∂ldy dates his tenure from around 156 to 159.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 231 After a space of a few years, he was appointed governor of Hispania Tarraconensis; Alf√∂ldy dates his tenure there from around 164 to 167.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 229 Then the sortition awarded him the proconsular governorship of Asia for the term 167/168.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 216 About this time, Pollio became a comes Augustorum, and accompanied the emperor Lucius Verus in the military campaigns against the Germans and Sarmatians, continuing after the emperor's death in 169, and earning dona militaria. He returned from the wars to open the year 176 at Rome with his second consulate. Due to his outstanding military service, Pollio was awarded two statues in his honor. One statue of him depicts him in military clothing and was erected at Trajan's Forum. The second statue portrays him in civilian clothing and was erected at the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina. Pollio was deputy to Lucius Verus‚Äô co-Emperor Marcus Aurelius in the Marcomannic Wars.  Family  Pollio married a noblewoman called Annia Fundania Faustina, a member of the ruling Nerva‚ÄìAntonine dynasty, whose paternal cousins were Marcus Aurelius and the Empress Faustina the Younger.Anthony Birley, Septimius Severus: the African emperor, revised edition (London: Routledge, 1999), pp. 236, 245 Fundania Faustina bore him two children: Titus Fundanius Vitrasius Pollio, whom Commodus had executed in 182 because of his involvement in a conspiracy against the Emperor, and a daughter, Vitrasia Faustina.

T√≤ he (toy figurine) is a traditional toy for children in Vietnam which is made from glutinous rice powder in form of edible figurine such as animals, flowers or characters in folk stories./to-he/ In the past, t√≤ he was made and sold only on the occasion of festivals, especially the T·∫øt and the Trung Thu which are the favorite festivals of Vietnamese children. Nowadays, the toy is introduced in almost all traditional festivals and in public places like parks or gardens. As t√≤ he is one of the rare surviving traditional toys of Vietnam, the art of t√≤ he making is considered a cultural ambassador of Vietnam and there are many efforts in order to preserve and develop this traditional art. Making To create a t√≤ he figurine, the craftsman needs a mixture of glutinous and ordinary rice powders which is easily to knead into different shapes and edible for children, bamboo sticks to plant the shaped t√≤ he and his own skill in graphic depicting. Modeled by the hand of the craftsmen, the forms of t√≤ he figurine are drawn from animals, flowers and characters in folk stories such as T√¥n Ng·ªô Kh√¥ng, the Monkey King in Journey to the West. There are seven basic colours of t√≤ he figurines which are green, sea blue, red, purple, yellow, white and black, those colours come from rice powder mixed with food dyes which are used to replace colours from trees or ashes in order to ensure the edibleness of t√≤ he. In the past, t√≤ he was steamed after being kneaded but today the figurines are made directly from preboiled paste so that the craftsman can reduce the time for making one t√≤ he figurine. The paste is made from glutinous and ordinary rice powders, it was kneaded with fresh water before dropped in boiling water for one hour and finally dyed with food colour. The procedure of t√≤ he making requires utmost patience from the craftsman, but almost all t√≤ he makers are men and there is an unwritten law in families of t√≤ he craftsmen that secret in making t√≤ he is only passed from father to sons and daughters-in-law, not to daughters. There are no lesson of t√≤ he making, sons are transmitted the skill from their father solely in watching and self-learning. Nevertheless, nowadays t√≤ he making is also taught to the handicapped so that they can live on making t√≤ he and other forms of traditional art. History A t√≤ he craftsman making an animal figurine besides the Temple of Literature, Hanoi. Traditionally, t√≤ he craftsmen had a compact set of tools so that in one day they could go to several common places such as markets, communal temple grounds and especially local festivals where children often gathered to play or accompany their parents. According to the old generation of t√≤ he craftsmen, the origin of t√≤ he making was dated to the 17th century. The two most important occasions each year for t√≤ he craftsmen are T·∫øt and Trung Thu because they are the favorite festivals for Vietnamnese children. Nowadays, t√≤ he is made and sold not only during the T·∫øt holiday and other festivals but also all year round in public place like parks, gardens. The price for a figurine sold in Hanoi varies from 3,000 to 5,000 VND. There is a village in the countryside of Hanoi where many people earn their living by making and selling t√≤ he, it is Xu√¢n La village which has about 200 t√≤ he craftsmen and almost all villagers from children to adults can make t√≤ he figurine in a very brief period. Facing the threat from modern toys and other forms of entertainment, t√≤ he craftsmen have to be more and more creative so that their figurines can appear more lively and closer to the children, for that reason t√≤ he figurines today can be also modeled after characters from international films and cartoons such as Doraemon, Pikachu and even Sailor Moon with her very own blond hair. As one of the rare surviving traditional toys in modern time, t√≤ he is considered a cultural ambassador of Vietnam. Some craftsmen are invited to the United States or South Korea to perform the art of t√≤ he making. Another positive sign for the existence of t√≤ he is that the Ministry of Culture and Information of Vietnam has paid more attention in preserving and propagating this traditional art. A t√≤ he craftsman from Th√°i B√¨nh was presented with medal from the Vietnam Folk Literature and Art Association for his effort in preserving the art of t√≤ he making while t√≤ he is frequently introduced in cultural festivals. T√≤ he is brought to the poor children of the mountainous region in the North of Vietnam who cannot afford to buy toys, they are also given instructions to make simple forms of t√≤ he figurines.

He was elected as Executive Governor of Taraba State, Nigeria running for the People's Democratic Party (PDP) in April 2007, and was sworn in on 29 May 2007. He ran successfully for reelection on 26 April 2011. Background Danbaba Danfulani Suntai was born on 30 June 1961 at Suntai Town in Bali Local Government Area of Taraba State. He attended Federal Government College, Kano (1975‚Äì1980) and the School of Basic Studies at Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria (1980‚Äì1981). He was admitted to Ahmadu Bello University where he read Pharmacy and graduated in 1984. He did his internship at Yola Specialist Hospital and his National Youth Service at the State Hospital, Ijaiye, Abeokuta, Ogun State (1985‚Äì1986). He then worked at the General Hospital, Ganye in old Gongola State until 1991. Early political career Danbaba Suntai was elected Chairman of Bali Local Government (1989‚Äì1993). Joining the Taraba State civil service, he was Director-General of the Taraba State Ministry of Agriculture and National Resources (1994‚Äì1996). In the 1999 elections, he was State chairman of the All People's Party (APP), when the PDP narrowly defeated the All Nigeria People's Party (ANPP). In 2000, he became Chairman of Taraba State Investment and Properties Ltd. He was appointed Commissioner of the Ministry of Education (2000‚Äì2003), and worked at the Ministry of Health (2003‚Äì2005) before becoming Secretary to the Taraba State Government (2005‚Äì2007). Governor of Taraba State Taraba State in Nigeria In the run-up to the 2007 elections, Danladi Baido won the PDP gubernatorial primaries but was later disqualified. Two months before the election the PDP national secretariat replaced Baido by Danbaba Suntai, who had not stood in the primaries. Baido and lent his support to Suntai, and in April 2007 Suntai won election as Governor of Taraba State. After the elections, relations between Suntai and Baido soured. The unsuccessful Action Congress candidate challenged the switch of PDP candidates and in February 2008 Baido joined this suit. In February 2009 Danladi Baido petitioned the Inspector General of Police, Mike Okiro over alleged SMS messages from Danbaba Suntai threatening to harm him and his family if he continued to appeal the election. In June 2009 Baido claimed that an attempt had been made to assassinate him, linking the incident to the alleged threats. During his tenure as governor Danbaba Suntai made efforts to fight corruption, crime and lack of discipline, while delegating authority and providing funds to the Local Government Areas. In January 2009 a group of Concerned Indigenes of Taraba State sent a petition to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), with a copy to President Umaru Yar'Adua, concerning alleged fraudulent financial practices in Suntai's administration. Claims included unnecessary imports of foreign cars, use of foreign rather than local workers, and inflated road building contracts. In October 2009 Suntai said he strongly supported religious and moral teaching aimed at reducing juvenile delinquency, crime and other vices. He said his administration was strongly behind both the Christian and Islamic faiths since both religions teach peace, love and unity. He initiated reforms to make local government administration more transparent. Among other effects, the monthly pension bill dropped from N33 million to N22 million, while pensioners began getting more regular payments.

He was involved in the ARPAnet project and helped develop various fundamental applications for the Internet. Cohen is probably best known for his 1980 paper \\"On Holy Wars and a Plea for Peace\\" Also published at IEEE Computer, October 1981 issue. which adopted the terminology of endianness for computing (a term borrowed from Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels). Cohen served on the computer science faculty at several universities and worked in the private industry. Biography Cohen earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics at the Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology in 1963. He was a graduate student in the math department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from 1965 to 1967. In 1967, Cohen developed the first real-time visual flight simulator on a general purpose computer and the first real-time radar simulator. Cohen's flight simulation work led to the development of the Cohen-Sutherland computer graphics line clipping algorithms, created with Ivan Sutherland at Harvard University.Principles of Interactive Computer Graphics p.124 and p.252, by Bob Sproull and William M. Newman, 1973, McGraw-Hill Education, International edition, He received a Ph.D. from Harvard in 1969 as a student of Sutherland. His thesis was titled: \\"Incremental Methods for Computer Graphics\\". After serving on the computer science faculty at Harvard through 1973, and at California Institute of Technology in 1976, Cohen joined the Information Sciences Institute at the University of Southern California to work on a packet-voice project designed to allow interactive, real-time speech over the ARPANet (and the Internet during its early development). The Network Voice Protocol project was a forerunner of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). In 1981, he adapted the visual simulator to run over the ARPANet which was an early application of packet switching networks to real-time applications. He started the MOSIS project in 1980. In 1993, he worked on Distributed Interactive Simulation through several projects funded by the United States Department of Defense (DoD). He prototyped a local area network technology called ATOMIC, which was the forerunner of Myrinet. In 1994, Cohen co-founded Myricom (with Chuck Seitz, and others) which commercialized Myrinet. Cohen also started the FastXchange project for electronic commerce and a digital library. Cohen served on several panels and boards for the US DoD, National Institutes of Health, and United States National Research Council, including 5 years on the USAF Scientific Advisory Board. He served as both a factual and expert witness in patent infringement legal cases about VoIP. Cohen was a commercial pilot with SEL/MEL/SES and Instrument ratings. In 1993 Cohen received the Meritorious Civilian Service Award from the United States Air Force. He was a member of the National Academy of Engineering (2006) and an IEEE Fellow (2010). Since 2001, Cohen was a distinguished engineer for Sun Microsystems working on very fast communication over short distances, using optical and electrical signaling, in Sun's chief technical officer organization. Cohen continued as an adjunct professor of computer science at USC. In 2012, Cohen was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame by the Internet Society.2012 Inductees, Internet Hall of Fame website.

It is the process of adapting a website into a different linguistic and cultural context‚Äî involving much more than the simple translation of text. This modification process must reflect specific language and cultural preferences in the content, images and overall design and requirements of the site ‚Äì all while maintaining the integrity of the website. Culturally adapted web sites reduce the amount of required cognitive efforts from visitors of the site to process information, making navigation easier and attitudes toward the web site more favorable. The modification of the website must additionally take into consideration the stated purpose of the new website with a focus on the targeted audience/market in the new locale. Website localization aims to customize a website so that it seems \\"natural\\", to its viewers despite cultural differences between the creators and the audience. Two factors are involved‚Äîprogramming expertise and linguistic/cultural knowledge. The proliferation of website localization is the result of the popularity of computer and Internet users. People all over the world treat the Internet as their main location for information and services. These people do not all speak the same language. As a result, website localization has become one of the primary tools for business global expansion. Due to website communication across multiple cultures for multiple needs, the Internet has given rise to non professional translation practices. Because website localization involves mixed strategies, organizations tend to maintain a global image while using website localization to appeal to local users. The challenge of website localization has become even more important as websites increasingly have the potential to both supplement and replace presence in foreign markets. As web design becomes more congruent with national culture, it will foster online consumer purchasing. Creators take into account the \\"language, education level, belief and value systems, [and] traditions and habits\\" of the target culture in order to optimize results. Process Website localization is more than mere translation. Translating only solves partial language problems. Measurement units must be converted; images and text are modified to appeal to the target culture. The process of website localization is complex and involves three different levels of adaptation. First is translation. Website localization involves adapting any text being used into the language of the country. It is important that translation of information be ‚Äúclear and understandable‚Äù to avoid cultural misunderstanding or offense. In order to translate, the \\"target culture\\" must be known. Second is the actual localization, which includes translation but also involves all other efforts and activities to ensure that the adaptation of textual materials, visual displays, illustrations and graphics are ‚Äúlinguistically and culturally appropriate for the target locale.‚Äù Target locale is understood as the ‚Äúmarket segment defined by criteria including language, currency, and perhaps educational level or income bracket.‚Äù Among the many technical elements which can be localized are: date and time formats, currency formats, number formats, address and telephone number formats, units of measure and connection speed. In order to ensure effective communication during the localization process, it is important to consider the following items: information architecture, theme and navigation, graphics, photographs, audio, and visual. Third is internationalization, which involves making sure that the software being used is fully compatible with the technology of the country in question. There are two important considerations to keep in mind during the process of website localization. The first is to focus on the demands of the user. The readers of the ‚Äúlocalized version of the website‚Äù want to be able to read and understand the pages in a way that makes sense to them. A second consideration is to take into account the goals of the client, whether an institution, government or individual, for example. Backend localization Many elements of a website that are different according to the locale of the client need only minor manual changes by a localizer, or none at all. For example, the system on which the website is created should automatically produce the correct currency symbol based on the country in which the client is located. * Website Analytics Software: This software can be created once generally, and then applied to each of the localized domains. * Site Search: Results can be reviewed using an algorithm that sifts through possible results using metadata. For example, a consumer who makes a query in the United States should not be shown a good that can only be purchased in Portugal. * Testimonials: Comments and feedback are often a vital part of a website. Localization efforts usually only include censorship. This can be done largely by software, however human review is sometimes necessary. * Information Storage: Databases are often used to store large amounts of information. They can be used to store generic data, like product information, as well as more specific information pertaining to certain locales. The business of website localization Using website localization to its best advantage is vital to any business seeking to move into international markets. With more and more companies seeking to tap into these lucrative markets, website localization has become quite profitable. The business side involves global and local coordination; production and operations, including finance; sales and marketing; language translation, including technology and linguistic coordination; software engineering, as well as design. The higher the technological abilities of the target culture, the more likely it is for website localization to be implemented and used effectively.

Speegleville was named for Israel Washington Speegle, a blacksmith and farmer who came to the area from Jasper County, Missouri, in 1849. A Baptist congregation, which was organized in 1859 as the Pleasant Grove Church, shared a building with the local school. The Speegleville post office operated from 1879 until 1929. Speegle was the first postmaster. Speegleville had a population of twenty-five in the mid-1880s and fifty by the early 1890s. In 1896 the community had two general stores, and the principal occupation of area residents was stock raising. That year the Speegleville school district had seventy-seven students and one teacher. Construction of Waco Dam in the late 1920s forced several residents to move their homes or businesses. Residents were forced to move again in the late 1950s and early 1960s because of the construction of the new Lake Waco dam. The original townsite was destroyed, and Speegleville became a scattered collection of houses instead of an organized town.

Development=Ca.331 O.A. (Ca.331A) The Caproni Ca.331 O.A. prototype.In response to a 1938 Italian Air Ministry requirement for a new tactical reconnaissance aircraft with combat capability, Ing Cesare Pallavacino of the Caproni companys Caproni Bergamaschi subsidiary began the design of the Ca.331 O.A. (O.A. standing for Osservazione Area, Italian for \\"Area Observation\\"), also designated Ca.331A, in October 1938. It was innovative for Caproni in being of all-metal construction. The Ca.331 O.A. prototype, a twin-engine low-wing monoplane with an unstepped cockpit and glazed nose, had duralumin stressed skin on both its fuselage and wings, and its wings were of an inverted gull-wing configuration. It had two Isotta Fraschini Delta RC.40 engines rated at 574 kilowatts (770 horsepower) each. The aircraft employed a three-man crew of pilot, observer/gunner, and radioman/gunner, and was armed with four 12.7-millimeter (0.5-inch) Breda- SAFAT machine guns‚Äîtwo of them in fixed mounts in the wing roots firing forward, one in a dorsal turret, and one in a ventral mount. The Ca.331 O.A. also had a bomb bay capable of carrying up to 1,000 kilograms (2,205 pounds) of bombs and four external bomb racks under its wings.Aerofan Issue 76, January‚ÄìMarch 2001, via modelingmadness.com LF Models 1/72 Caproni Ca.331 OA/CN .warbirdsform.com GOT: The Caproni Ca. 331. The Ca.331 O.A. prototype first flew on 31 August 1940, at Ponte San Pietro with Caproni test pilot Ettore Wengi at the controls. Its original Piaggio propellers proved inadequate, but their replacement with Alfa Romeo-built propellers in 1941 resulted in the aircraft having improved performance which, in fact, exceeded expectations. In 1941, Caproni Bergamaschi delivered the prototype to the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force), which began official tests at Guidonia Montecelio with good results. However, the Regia Aeronautica handed the aircraft back to Caproni Bergamaschi without a production order. The German Air Force (Luftwaffe) then requested control of the aircraft for trials at its test center at Rechlin in Germany. Although the Luftwaffe was impressed with the aircraft‚Äîprobably more so than the Italians‚Äîno German order for it resulted. The Ca.331 O.A. won widespread praise from both the Italian and German pilots‚Äîincluding German fighter ace Werner M√∂lders (1913‚Äì1941) -- who tested it, and the chief of the German Luftwaffe, Hermann G√∂ring (1893‚Äì1946), was given a demonstration of its capabilities at Guidonia Montecelio in January 1942. The reasons for the lack of a production order by either Italy or Germany remain obscure and a matter of debate. Reasons given by various sources include a supposed overreliance on the use of materials in the Ca.331s construction that may have been in scarce supply (although this itself is controversial) in wartime Italy and Germany; the use of too many parts in the Ca.331, uncommon with other Italian aircraft (although it is not clear what specifically these may have been); political problems that Caproni company founder Gianni Caproni (1886‚Äì1957) may have had with the Italian Fascist government (which have not been identified clearly); an unwillingness of the Italian military to cooperate too closely with their German counterparts for fear of being dominated by Germany in the event of a German victory in World War II; or simply that the Ca.331 was under development for so long that the requirement for it disappeared before it could enter production, a common problem in the Italian aircraft industry during the World War II years.For a discussion of these issues, see warbirdsform.com GOT: The Caproni Ca. 331. The sole Ca.331 O.A. prototype was at the Caproni company airfield at Taliedo at the time the Italian armistice with the Allies took effect on 8 September 1943. Seized by German forces, it was disassembled, shipped to Germany, and later scrapped. Ca.331 C.N. (Ca.331B) The second Caproni Ca.331 prototype. Ordered as a second Ca.331 O.A. reconnaissance aircraft prototype, it was completed instead as the first prototype of the Ca.331 C.N. night fighter as seen here, probably during weapons testing at the Furbara firing range.By 1942, the war situation had changed to the point where Italy perceived a greater need for air defense capabilities. Accordingly, in May 1942 the Italian Air Ministry ordered the second Ca.331 prototype, originally planned as a second Ca.331 O.A., to be completed instead as the first prototype of a night fighter version of the aircraft. The night fighter prototype was designated Ca.331 C.N., with \\"C.N.\\" standing for Caccia Notturna, Italian for \\"Night Fighter\\" it also was known as the Ca.331B. The Ca.331 C.N., which first flew in the summer of 1942, differed from the Ca.331 O.A. in having a stepped cockpit and less nose glazing. Its armament was installed in the spring of 1943 and consisted of four fixed forward-firing 20-millimeter Mauser MG 151 cannon and four 12.7-millimeter (0.5-inch) Breda- SAFAT machine guns‚Äîtwo of them forward-firing and fixed, one in a dorsal turret, and one in a ventral mount. Its original 596-kilowatt (800-horsepower) 12-cylinder air-cooled Isotta Fraschini Delta IV engines were replaced by the spring of 1943 with 633-kilowatt (850-horsepower) versions of the Delta IV with two-stage superchargers. Like the Ca.331 O.A. prototype, it was at the Caproni company airfield at Taliedo when the Italian armistice with the Allies took effect on 8 September 1943, and it suffered the same fate: The Germans seized it there, disassembled it and shipped it to Germany. A second Ca.331 C.N. prototype was constructed, differing from the first in having an armament of two 20-millimeter Ikaria cannon and four 12.7-millimeter Breda-SAFAT machine guns, all mounted in the nose. It was still being assembled when Italy surrendered to the Allies on 8 September 1943, was seized by the Germans and shipped to Germany, destined never to fly. Various modifications were proposed for production models of the Ca.331 C.N. Engines proposed for production models included the German 1,099-kilowatt (1,475-horsepower) Daimler-Benz DB 605, the Italian 931-kilowatt (1,250-horsepower) Isotta Fraschini Zeta R.C.42, and the Fiat RA-1050 RC.58 Tifone (Italian for \\"Typhoon\\"), an Italian copy of the DB 605 expected to give the Ca.331 C.N. a top speed of per hour. Italian authorities also made various aggressive plans for production of Ca.331 C.N. aircraft, with as many as 100 built by May 1942 toward an eventual total production run of 1,000 aircraft. However, all production plans were cancelled in January 1943. Other variants Germany considered building a dual- control combat trainer version of the Ca.331 to be designated the Ca.331G. Nothing came of the proposal. An anti-tank version mounting a 37-millimeter cannon also was proposed, but none were built.

She is best known as the first person to portray Madge Allsop, bridesmaid and companion to Barry Humphries' most popular and enduring comic character, Dame Edna Everage. Early life Born in West Melbourne in 1914, Madeleine Grace Orr was the daughter of Charles Hugh Orr (1883‚Äì1932) and his wife Madeleine, nee Walsh, (1888‚Äì1961). Charles Orr was a caterer and hotelkeeper by profession, and he and his wife ran a succession of inner city hotels in the early twentieth century including the City Court Hotel and Tattersall's Hotel, both in Russell Street, Melbourne. After Charles' death in 1932, his widow continued as licensee of the latter hotel for some years thence. During the 1930s, Charles and Madeleine's like-named daughter maintained a high profile in Melbourne's social circles, with her name often recorded in the women's column of the daily newspapers as a guest at parties, balls and dances. The younger Madeleine Orr was reported present, for example, at a 1934 junior auxiliary dance for the District Nurses' Society,\\"Junior Auxiliary Dance\\", 21 August 1935, p 17. a 1935 charity ball aboard the troopship Duntroon\\"Duntroon Ball for two charities\\", The Argus, 15 October 1935, p 4. and a 1937 German-themed beer garden party.\\"Beer garden setting for Party\\", The Argus, 29 January 1937, p 3. Such connections inevitably gained her entree into Melbourne's theatrical community. In 1935, Orr was noted as one of several young women who sold programmes and sweets at a special fundraising performance that was held at Her Majesty's Theatre.\\"Matinee for Mr Wenman\\", The Argus, 4 September 1935, p17. Professional life Madeleine Orr started her professional career as a singer, but soon moved into radio productions and repertory and commercial theatre.Biography of Madeleine Orr, in theatre programme for Robert and Elizabeth, Melbourne, 1966. Her earliest recorded stage appearances, dating back to 1937, included a production of J. B. Priestley's Duet in Floodlight at the Tivoli Theatre\\"Plays and Players\\", The Age, 10 September 1937, p 6. and in a one act-play, Pedlar's Progress, at the Melbourne Little Theatre.\\"The Little Theatre\\"\\", The Argus, 8 November 1937, p 4. In the early 1940s, she was a cast member of two radio serials, Bright Horizons and Golden Sanctuaries, produced by 2CH in Sydney. She went on to appear in the Melbourne season of Doris Fitton's Dark of the Moon, \\"an unusual folk play with music\\", which opened at the Comedy Theatre in 1952. For many years, Orr was also associated with the St Martin's Theatre, a small independent playhouse in the Melbourne suburb of South Yarra. She appeared there in productions of several Australian plays including The Tower by Hal Porter (1964) and The Jabberwock (1966) by Patricia Napper, as well as the Australian premiere of The Physicists (1964) by Swiss playwright Friedrich D√ºrrenmatt. Like many Australian actors of her generation, Orr intended to travel to the United Kingdom to further her professional experience and, after several proposed but postponed trips, finally arrived in early 1965\\"Actress returned\\", The Age, 24 December 1965, p 12. She spent more than seven months in London, living with Australian-born opera singer Sylvia Fisher and her husband Ubaldo Gardini in their Bayswater home. During that time, Orr was briefly employed by the BBC and appeared in the television play Verdict. Otherwise, she spent much of her time attending West End shows, including productions of Ivanov (with John Gielgud) and Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad (with Hermione Gingold). She also attended a controversial \\"late night show\\" performed by Elizabeth Seal and her husband Zach Matalon, which closed after that one performance. On her return to Melbourne in December 1965, Orr informed the local press that \\"I was disappointed by the general standard of theatre in London's West End\\". Orr's next major role was in the Australian premiere of the stage musical Robert and Elizabeth, which opened at the Princess Theatre, Melbourne, on 21 May 1966, and ran for six months. She reprised her role in the subsequent Sydney production, which was not as successful; it opened on 19 November 1966, but closed less than four weeks later.\\"Musical Sydney did not want\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 15 December 1966, p 6. Orr remained in Sydney for two weeks' rest, returning to Melbourne in January 1967. Her next appearance on the musical stage was in an original Australian show entitled Razza-ma-tazz (and all that Jazz), co-written by John-Michael Howson, which was produced at the Southland Theatre in 1968.\\"The Yen to go to Kathmandu: Women in the Theatre\\", The Age, 20 September 1968, p 11. In a 1966 theatre programme biography, Orr was also described \\"a composer of popular ballads\\", whose compositions had been used on many occasions by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. During the 1960s, she also appeared on a number of Australian television series including Homicide, and Division 4. In 1968, she appeared in a pilot for a new TV series entitled Once upon a Twilight, which, inspired by the popularity of The Monkees, was to depict the semi-fictitious adventures of a real-life local band, The Twilights. Despite much publicity in the local music paper, Go-Set, the series was cancelled after its principal sponsor, Ford Motor Company, withdrew its backing. Orr subsequently performed in a new production of Shakespeare's All's Well that Ends Well, directed by Sir Tyrone Guthrie, which opened at Melbourne's Princess Theatre. On 21 October 1970, for a limited three-week season.\\"All's well that ends well\\" [advertisement], The Age, 12 October 1970, p 104. By the early 1970s, Madeline Orr had settled permanently in London, where she appeared in two episodes of Crossroads (1973) and the TV mini-series adaptation of David Copperfield (1974). She then performed the role of Mrs McFudd in the West End revival of the stage musical Irene (1976).\\"Irene for Adelphi\\", The Times [London], 24 May 1976, p 7. The latter show included, in the title role, fellow Australian actress Julie Anthony, who had won acclaim in the 1974 Australian production of the same show. Although Orr had not appeared in that production, her role of Mrs McFudd was played by Australian actress Connie Hobbs, who, ironically, would take over the role of Madge Allsop after Orr's death in 1979. Madeleine Orr first appeared as Dame Edna Everage's long-suffering bridesmaid and companion in the BBC TV series The Barry Humphries Show (1976). Several photographs of Orr, in character as Madge, were subsequently included in Humphries' book, Dame Edna's Coffee Table Book, which was published in London later that year. In June 1978, Orr returned to Australia to help Humphries publicise his latest LP release, The Sound of Edna. At the record launch, Orr (again in the guise of Madge Allsop) arrived in the back of a panel van and then recited a poem that was purportedly written for the occasion by Dame Edna herself. As Madge explained to the press, \\"Dame Edna wrote it because I'm a bit of an idiot\\".\\"Dame Edna's leading the punk revival\\", The Age, 28 June 1978, p 5. A newspaper article describing the event was accompanied by a photograph of Dame Edna (in her punk outfit) with bridesmaid Madge, both straddling a huge motorcycle. One of the songs on the album, titled \\"My Bridesmaid and I\\", was dedicated to Madge Allsop; a photograph of Orr, in character, was subsequently included in Humphries' accompanying publication The Sound of Edna: Dame Edna's Family Songbook (1979) Madeleine Orr then returned to London, where, in her last TV appearance before her death, she played Mrs Hemmings in a 1979 episode of the Arthur Lowe vehicle Potter. Personal life In September 1952, Madeline Orr announced her engagement to John Reed Hearly of Elwood.\\"Engagements\\", The Age, 16 September 1952, p 5. Orr died of cancer in London on 29 June 1979. A portion of her estate was bequeathed to the University of Melbourne for the establishment of a scholarship in her memory.

Robinette was platted around 1898, along a Northwest Railway Company line that never developed. In 1909, a railroad station and townsite at this locale were named for James E. Robinette, a native of Maryland. Robinette came to what was then Union County in 1884 and settled on the west bank of the Snake River near the mouth of the Powder River in 1887. Robinette post office was also established in 1909. By 1940, when Robinette had a population of 46, it was the northern terminus of a branch line of the Union Pacific Railroad (Oregon Short Line) that ran along the Snake River from Huntington, and served the Pine Valley and Eagle Valley agricultural areas to the north. The line had previously extended further north to Homestead, but that section, which was used to haul ore from the Cornucopia area mines, was later abandoned and the railroad grade was converted into a highway. The Robinette railhead of the Union Pacific branch line \\"probably generated most of the freight hauled by the railroad.\\" The townsite is now under the water of the Brownlee Reservoir, which was created by the damming of the Snake River by the Brownlee Dam in 1958. Before the flooding, the Robinette Store was moved to Richland, where it still stands today. Richland, the closest city to Robinette, was formerly accessible by a road along the Powder River that has since been flooded by the reservoir. The post office was closed in 1957. As of 2010, the United States Geological Survey still classified Robinette as a populated place. Robinette was home to the Stil-Van Lumber Company from 1949 until just prior to the town being flooded. Marion Dale Stillwell sold the company, including timber rights, to Ellingson Lumber Company from Baker City. Stillwell also received compensation when the Robinette facility flooded.

It is a former fortification built beginning in 1879 and occupied by the army until 1932. From 1933 it was leased by the Hispano Suiza company as a factory, surrounded by other industrial structures. The site was abandoned by Hispano Suiza in 1990, and was sold by the Ministry of Defense in 1999. In 2006 the battery became the \\"Cafe Musiques\\", surrounded by office buildings and a music school. History In 1870 France was partly occupied by the Prussian army. Following that defeat, France instituted the S√©r√© de Rivi√®res system of fortifications, with a new outer ring of fortifications to defend Paris from long-range artillery bombardment. 18 forts, five redoubts and 34 batteries were built between 1874 and 1881. The Batterie de Bouviers was built between 1877 and 1879 as part of this project, near the village of Bouviers in the town of Guyancourt. Since the battery was built the town has expanded with the construction of the Saules neighborhood in the vicinity of the battery. The Batterie de Bouviers was part of an ensemble comprising two forts, the Fort de Villeras in Saclay and the Fort du Haut-Buc, with five peripheral works: the Batterie de la Port du D√©sert (destroyed), the Batterie de la station de St-Cyr (partly destroyed), the Batterie du Ravin de Bouviers, the Ouvrage des Docks and the Batteries de Bouviers. The Batterie du Ravin de Bouviers is of modest dimensions, and is therefore sometimes termed a redoubt. The similarity between the Battery/Redoubt du Ravin de Bouviers and the Batterie de Bouviers has given rise to confusion between the two positions. The strategy for siting the various fortified positions was one of mutual support between fortifications, with converging fields of fire on enemy troops attempting to pass between fortifications. When conceived in the 1870s the fortifications were considered impregnable. However, the introduction of high- explosive shells capable of penetrating masonry made these positions obsolete almost as soon as they were completed.  Description  Entry to the casemates The principal battery, known as the caserne sous le parados (barracks under the entrance) is composed of gun chambers all oriented opening on the northeastern facade, with arched vaults expressed on the main wall as blind arches. Materials include limestone, millstone and brick. Concrete was added after 1879, and was retained in the 2006 renovation. A small bastion protects the entry from direct fire directly opposite the gate. The military battery Plan of the Batterie de Bouviers The central portion of the battery is composed of rectangular units measuring by , vaulted, and separated from each other by sidewalls in depth, housing the casemates. Individual vaults are structurally independent of the others, preventing damage to one from affecting the others. The casemates are covered by soil up to thick in a trapezoidal mass, using material excavated from the battery's dry moat, which surrounds the position. The barracks are served by a corridor to the rear. Doors and windows were fitted with armored shutters, providing protection against shrapnel. Fittings for the shutters remain in place. Two caponiers covered the front of the battery on the far side of the ditch, and another covered the ditch to the rear. The ditch and caponniers have been destroyed, along with the powder magazines. The gate is crowned with the inscription \\"Batterie de Bouviers\\" and \\"1879,\\" with a relief of a mortar on the keystone. Rainwater was collected by gutters and channeled to cisterns under the battery, supporting at least 200 troops and 19 artillery pieces. After the introduction of high explosive artillery shells, the fortifications became obsolete. The forts closest to the frontiers were modified, but the fortifications of Paris received little improvement due to financial restrictions. Hispano Suiza Hispano Suiza building in 2000 The battery was occupied by the military until 1932. From 1933 the battery was leased to Hispano Suiza who surrounded it with numerous industrial buildings, where the company made munitions. This caused friction with the local populace, which was until this time predominantly agricultural. Daily test firing caused further concern.D√©lib√©ration du Conseil municipal, 17 septembre 1933 At the beginning of World War II, the battery was bombarded and munitions production was relocated to the Charente. After the war work was confined to work on motors and turbines. The factory was closed in 1990 and sold by the Ministry of Defense in 1999.  Present use  The battery was transformed in 2006 to the \\"Caf√© Musiques\\" and opened to the public. The architects were Ivan Franic and Michel Garcin with acoustician Maurice Auffret. Work was sponsored by Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines. The cafe provides a proscenium stage and accommodations for 450 spectators, three rehearsal and recording studios, technical rooms, dressing rooms and administrative offices, with an adjoining cafe. First stone of the music school (18 October 2008) Work began on the music school in 2008, designed by architect Yann Brunel. The former industrial lands have been redeveloped.

Beliefs The Waqifites believed in the Mahdism and the occultation of Imam M≈´s√† ibn Ja‚Äòfar al-KƒÅ·∫ìim. They believed Musa was alive, did not die, and would never die, that he was raised to heaven just as Jesus was raised, and that he was the awaited one who would fill the world with justice and fairness as it was filled with oppression and tyranny.The Waqifites' and Their Doctrines However, they later differed amongst themselves concerning Musa‚Äôs death and split into four sub-groups. Three of the sub-groups believed that Musa had died, while the other remaining sub-group persistently denied that Musa al-Kadhim had died.The Imamite Activities during the Period of Imam al-Kazim (A.S.) Reasons for the creation of the Waqifites‚Äô beliefs The most probable reason for the creation of the Waqifites‚Äô beliefs is that when Musa al-Kadhim, was in the prison of the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid, he appointed some agents on his behalf in order to collect the legal monetary rights from his Sh√Ø‚Äòites. These agents included Ziyad ibn Marwan al-Qandi and ‚ÄòAli ibn Abu Hamza (in Kufa), who collected funds of 70,000 and 30,000 dinars respectively. Other such agents included \`Uthman ibn \`Isa al-Rawasi (in Egypt), and Hayyan and al-Sarraj (in Kufa).The Imamite Activities during the Period of Imam al- Kazim (A.S.) When Musa died, these agents bought country estates and houses from the money they had collected on behalf of Musa. When Ali ar-Ridha demanded that they give the money to him (as the rightful successor of his father Musa), they refused to hand it over to him, since they denied that Musa ever died. Therefore, these agents denied Musa‚Äôs death and rejected Ali ar- Ridha‚Äôs Imamate in order that they would have an excuse for not returning the money. Such agents then spread the Waqifites‚Äô beliefs by lavishly spending money in order to buy the minds of the people and to misguide them.The Waqifites' and Their DoctrinesThe Imamite Activities during the Period of Imam al-Kazim (A.S.) The other (less probable) reason for the creation of the Waqifites‚Äô beliefs is that Musa‚Äôs father, Ja'far al-Sadiq (the 6th Imam), reported many traditions concerning the occultation and the rise of al-Qa'im, but did not indicate explicitly which of his descendants would be al-Qa'im. Therefore, a considerable number of the muhaddithun thought that Ja'far al- Sadiq had indicated his son Musa and hence stopped at him, contending that he was the Mahdi and was in a state of occultation.The Imamite Activities during the Period of Imam al-Kazim (A.S.) Extinction of the sect The Waqifites continued in their beliefs for a long time, but decreased in number with the passage of time, until the death of the theory and the extinction of those who believed in it. The extinction of the sect was especially hastened when Imam Ali ar-Ridha (who himself faced many difficulties in proving his own right to the Imamate, not only to his father's prominent followers, but also to his brother Ahmad)The Imamite Activities during the Period of Imam al-Kazim (A.S.) confirmed the death of his father and said to the Waqifites: He suspected those who claimed that his father did not die, of lying and said: Prominent Waqifite personalities Some of the eminent figures and leaders of the Waqifites included: Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Shammun,The Imamite Activities during the Period of Imam al-Kazim (A.S.) Ali Ibn Abu Hamza, al-Husayn ibn Mahran, and Ibn Abu Sa‚Äò√Ød.The Waqifites' and Their Doctrines Another eminent person attributed to the Waqifites was Yazid ibn Khalifa al- Harithi, who was regarded as one of the companions of Ja'far al-Sadiq (who reportedly praised him).The Narrators of Imam Jafar al-Sadiq(A.S.) Books written by the Waqifites 'Ali ibn al-Hasan al-Ta'i al-Tatari (a companion of Musa al- Kadhim) named Musa al-Kadhim as the hidden Imam. In defense of his view he wrote Kitab al-Ghayba, which became the framework for the works of later Waqifite authors on the issue of al-Ghayba (the occultation). One such author was Al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn Suma\`a (d. 263 A.H. / 877 C.E.), the Waqifite student of al-Ta'i al-Tatari. The information in the book he composed was later used by Twelver Shia who lived during the period from 260‚Äì329 A.H. / 874-940-1 C.E., like al-Hasan al-Saffar (d. 292 A.H. / 904 C.E.) and Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni, to support their claim that the hidden Imam was not the 7th Imam (i.e. Musa al-Kadhim), but rather the 12th Imam (i.e. Muhammad al- Mahdi).Books on the Question of the Ghayba See also *Islamic schools and branches *List of extinct Shia sects References *Ikhtiyar Ma‚Äôrifah al- Rijal, by Al-Kashi, pg.379 Notes Category:Shia Islamic branches Category:Mahdiism ","title":"Waqifite Shia"},{"id":"25823543","text":"Sublette County School District #1 is a public school district based in Pinedale, Wyoming, United States.

This species typically grows to across and has a rounded pectoral fin disc and (in adults) a wide band of dermal denticles over its back. It is characterized by a greatly enlarged, nacreous denticle in the middle of its back called a \\"pearl spine\\"; this feature is shared with the similar but much smaller pearl stingray (D. margaritella), which has often been confused with this species. The daisy stingray feeds mainly on crustaceans and exhibits aplacental viviparity, with litters of 1-4 young. Heavily pressured by fisheries and possibly habitat degradation, this once-common species is declining and has been assessed as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Taxonomy British zoologist Albert G√ºnther originally described the daisy stingray as Trygon margarita, in his 1870 Catalogue of the Fishes in the British Museum; subsequent authors synonymized the genus Trygon with Dasyatis.Catalog of Fishes (Online Version) . California Academy of Sciences. Retrieved on January 15, 2010. This species resembles, and is likely closely related to, the pearl stingray and the Niger stingray (D. garouaensis), both also native to West Africa. Numerous scientific accounts of the daisy stingray have been confounded by confusion with the pearl stingray; this confusion dates back to the two West African specimens referenced in G√ºnther's original description. In 1984, Leonard Compagno and Tyson Roberts identified one of them as a pearl stingray and designated the other as the lectotype for this species. The specific epithet margarita is derived from the Latin for \\"pearl\\", referring to the large tubercle on its back. Distribution and habitat The known range of the daisy stingray extends from Senegal to the Democratic Republic of the Congo; records of it occurring as far as Mauritania and Angola may have been mistakenly based on the pearl stingray. This bottom-dwelling species is found in marine and brackish waters with a salinity of 20-40 ppt. It favors sandy habitats in shallow coastal waters to a depth of , though most are found between . This ray also reportedly frequents lagoons and estuaries; however, this also requires confirmation due to confusion with the pearl stingray. Description The pectoral fin disc of the daisy stingray is moderately thin and rounded, measuring about as wide as long. The leading margins of the disc are concave and converge at the pointed, slightly projecting tip of the snout. The eyes are medium-sized and followed by somewhat larger spiracles. There is a curtain of skin between the nares, with a fringed, subtly tri-lobed posterior margin; a pair of shallow grooves run from the skin flap to the corners of the bow-shaped mouth. There are 5 papillae in a transverse row across the floor of the mouth, with the outermost pair set apart from the others. The tooth rows number 24-32 in the upper jaw and 28-36 rows in the lower jaw, and are arranged with a quincunx pattern into pavement-like surfaces. The pelvic fins are short, with the tips projecting just past the disc margin. The tail is longer than the disc and usually bears a single long, thin stinging spine on the upper surface. The tail is broad and flattened at the base, becoming slender and whip-like past the spine with a low dorsal keel and a well-developed ventral fin fold. There is a massive, circular pearl spine at the center of the disc. Young rays are otherwise smooth-skinned, while older rays over across gain a wide band of small, flattened, circular dermal denticles covering the median third of the back from between the eyes to the base of the tail, as well as small prickles covering the tail behind the sting. This ray is a plain grayish brown above, and whitish below. It reaches a maximum known disc width of and weight of , though most do not exceed a width of . Females grow larger than males. Apart from being much larger, the daisy stingray can also be distinguished from the pearl stingray in having a relatively larger, round pearl spine, fewer tooth rows, and more pectoral fin radials (129-136 versus 113-127). Biology and ecology Little is known of the natural history of the daisy stingray. It feeds mainly on shrimp, crabs, bivalves, and annelid worms. Off Nigeria, some three-quarters of its diet consists of the shrimp Farfantepenaeus duorarum.Omotosho, J.S. and M.O. Oyebanji (1997). On some aspects of the biology of Dasyatis margarita (Gunther) from Nigeria continental shore. University of Ilorin. Retrieved on January 15, 2010. Like other stingrays, this species is aplacental viviparous. Females bear litters of 1-4 pups, with coastal lagoons and estuaries serving as a breeding ground. Reproductive activity peaks during the rainy season from April to September, likely to correspond to high abundances of prey species. Human interactions The tail spine of the daisy stingray is reportedly highly venomous and potentially injurious to humans. The daisy stingray is caught by intensive artisanal and small-scale commercial fisheries occurring off the coasts of Senegal, Ghana, and C√¥te d'Ivoire, and sold fresh, smoked, or dried and salted for human consumption. A wide variety of fishing gear is used, including longlines, bottom trawls, trammel nets, gillnets, traps, beach seines, and hook-and-line. Habitat degradation from agricultural runoff and industrial development may also threaten its population. Once common, catches of this slow-reproducing ray have become scarce in recent years, leading the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess it as Endangered. The daisy stingray has not yet been the target of any specific conservation schemes.

Most notable among his books was Villages, published in 1981 and described thirteen years later as \\"a classic study of the forces eroding small towns.\\" Villages was based on his having \\"studied 18 villages in 13 countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America,\\" and lived in those villages for long periods, \\"doing whatever was the dominant mode of earning a living.\\" Critchfield described his form of writing as \\"village reporting.\\" In the words of his New York Times obituary, he \\"lived and worked among villagers of the third world to tell their story to Western readers,\\" often addressing changes in traditional ways of life. Critchfield believed that the U.S. defeat in Vietnam \\"was not a failure of power, but a failure of knowledge,\\" that is, the result of a U.S. lack of understanding \\"the ordinary Vietnamese peasant out in his village and . . . his Confucian culture.\\" In a 1980 article he argued, presciently, that agriculture in the Soviet Union was failing (among other reasons, \\"the Russians can blame Marxism-Leninism for their farming failure\\"), while Chinese agriculture was succeeding (where the Great Leap Forward to collective agriculture \\"proved such a fiasco that the Chinese made a brisk retreat back toward the family farm\\"). He died in 1994 in Washington, D.C., after suffering a stroke; he was there for a party to celebrate the publication of his last book, The Villagers, a follow-up to Villages. Critchfield won significant honors. In 1965, he won an Overseas Press Club award for his reporting from Vietnam. He was awarded an Alice Patterson Fellowship in 1970 to report on the topic \\"Food Population Crisis in India, Indonesia and Iran.\\" He was chosen as a MacArthur Fellow in December 1981, the first year of that \\"genius grant\\" program, and accordingly awarded a $244,000 grant. On the other hand, Columbia professor of Middle Eastern Studies Timothy Mitchell has vocally criticized Critchfield, arguing that Critchfield's writing on Egypt plagiarized from older and uninformed sources, and was disingenuous and/or inaccurate in its descriptions of Egyptian life. Mitchell further asserts that Critchfield's work was supported by and supported the U.S. academic and foreign policy establishment, noting that it was partly financed by the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the U.S. Agency for International Development; that his brother was an early and senior CIA employee; that many of the sites of his reporting, such as Vietnam, Mauritius, and Egypt, were significant to U.S. foreign policy; and that he was on friendly terms with Robert McNamara and \\"other figures associated with the CIA and the politico-military establishment.\\" Publications=Books *The Indian Reporter's Guide (1962) *The Long Charade: Political Subversion in the Vietnam War (1968) *Lore and Legend of Nepal (1971) *The Golden Bowl Be Broken: Peasant Life in Four Cultures (1973 and 1988) *Shahhat: An Egyptian (1978) * *Those Days: An American Album (1986)  Articles (some) *\\"The Alicia Patterson Foundation Newsletters of Richard Critchfield\\" *\\"The New Environment of Foreign Aid\\", The Nation, May 15, 1972 *\\"Why Soviet Breadbasket is Never Full\\", Christian Science Monitor, April 22, 1980 *\\"Science and the Villager: The Last Sleeper Wakes\\", Foreign Affairs, Fall 1982 *\\"The Village Voice of Richard Critchfield: Bringing the Third World to the Fourth Estate\\", Washington Journalism Review, October 1985 ReferencesExternal links * Category:MacArthur Fellows Category:1931 births Category:1994 deaths Category:20th-century American essayists ","title":"Richard Critchfield"},{"id":"25823617","text":"Raja Bora (Assamese: ‡ß∞‡¶æ‡¶ú‡¶æ ‡¶¨‡ß∞‡¶æ), alias Polash Phukan, was the personal bodyguard of Arabinda Rajkhowa, the chairman of United Liberation Front of Assam, a revolutionary rebel organisation operating in the Indian state of Assam.

Named for the siege of Sevastopol during the Crimean War, the ship was commissioned into the First Pacific Squadron of the Russian Pacific Fleet and was stationed at Port Arthur (today L√ºshunkou District, Dalian, Liaoning, China), a Russian naval base acquired from China in 1898 as part of the Kwantung Leased Territory. One of the first ships to use Harvey nickel-steel armor and Popov radios, she displaced at full load and was long overall, and mounted a main battery of four guns in two twin turrets. She was laid down in May 1892, launched on 1 June 1895 and completed in 1899. Her sea trials lasted until 1900. Sevastopol saw service in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì1905. Slightly damaged during a surprise attack on Port Arthur in early February, the ship later participated in several attempts to break out from the besieged port. The most notable of these was the Battle of the Yellow Sea, where she was damaged by several shells but managed to make it back to port with the remnants of the Russian Fleet, leaving one crewman dead and 62 wounded. Immediately after the surrender of Port Arthur, Sevastopol was scuttled to prevent her capture by the Imperial Japanese Navy. The Japanese never raised her. The remains of the ship still lie outside the entrance to the port. Design and description The design of the Petropavlovsk-class ships was derived from the battleship , but was greatly enlarged to accommodate an armament of four and eight guns. While under construction their armament was revised to consist of more powerful 12-inch guns and the 8-inch guns were replaced by a dozen guns. The ships were long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . Designed to displace , Sevastopol was almost overweight and displaced when completed. The ship was powered by two vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, using steam generated by 16 cylindrical boilers. The engines were rated at and designed to reach a top speed of , but Sevastopol only reached a speed of from during her sea trials. She carried enough coal to give her a range of at a speed of . She had a crew of 662. The Petropavlovsk-class ships' main battery consisted of four 12-inch guns mounted in two twin-gun turrets, one each forward and one aft of the superstructure. Designed to fire one round per 90 seconds, the actual rate of fire was half that. Their secondary armament consisted of twelve Canet six-inch quick-firing (QF) guns. Eight of these were mounted in four twin-gun wing turrets and the remaining guns were positioned in unprotected embrasures on the sides of the hull amidships. Smaller guns were carried for defense against torpedo boats, including ten QF Hotchkiss guns and twenty-eight Maxim QF guns. They were also armed with six torpedo tubes, four tubes above water and two submerged tubes, all mounted on the broadside. They carried 50 mines to be used to protect her anchorage. The Russians could not manufacture the Harvey armor used by Sevastopol, so the ship's armor was ordered from Bethlehem Steel in America, although only her waterline armor belt was made from Harvey armor and the rest was nickel steel. The armor belt was thick. The main gun turrets had a maximum thickness of of armor and her deck armor ranged from in thickness.  Construction and career Kronstadt in 1900alt=A black and white picture of a large ship with a small, lifeboat-sized ship in front of it Sevastopol, named for the siege of Sevastopol during the Crimean War, was laid down at the Galernii Island shipyard in Saint Petersburg on 7 March 1892. Construction was led by two engineers, E. P. Andruschenko and N. I. Afanasyev, and began on 7 May 1892, about the same time as the battleship was laid down. The ceremony was attended by Alexander III of Russia and then-Tsesarevich Nicholas II. Sevastopol was launched on 1 June 1895 and, after the completion of her hull and decks in 1898, was transferred to Kronstadt where her armor and guns were installed. Sevastopol was finished in 1899 and Nikolai Chernishev became her captain, a post which he would retain until 17 March 1904, when Nikolai Essen assumed command. Sevastopol began her sea trials on 16 October 1899, and was commissioned after their conclusion into the Imperial Russian Navy. She and her sister ships were transferred to Port Arthur, which was then the base of the First Squadron of the Russian Pacific Fleet. In September 1900, Popov radios were installed on Sevastopol and her sister Poltava, the first Russian battleships to have them. They were also painted white, the same color as the other ships in the First Pacific Squadron. She then left for Port Arthur, arriving on 13 April 1901. As Russia was not at war with any Far East countries at that time, Sevastopol stayed in port, inactive.  Battle of Port Arthur  alt=A black and white shot of three large ships near a hill- like background, with several small skiffs in the foreground After the Japanese victory in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894‚Äì1895, both Russia and Japan had ambitions to control Manchuria and Korea, resulting in tensions between the two nations. Japan had begun negotiations to reduce the tensions in 1901, but the Russian government was slow and uncertain in its replies because it had not yet decided exactly how to resolve the problems. Japan interpreted this as deliberate prevarication designed to buy time to complete the Russian armament programs. The situation was worsened by Russia's failure to withdraw its troops from Manchuria in October 1903 as promised. The final straws were the news of Russian timber concessions in northern Korea and the Russian refusal to acknowledge Japanese interests in Manchuria while continuing to place conditions on Japanese activities in Korea. These actions caused the Japanese government to decide in December 1903 that war was inevitable. As tensions with Japan increased, the Pacific Squadron began mooring in the outer harbor at night in order to react more quickly to any Japanese attempt to land troops in Korea. In early February 1904, the Japanese Navy launched a surprise attack on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur. Sevastopol was hit by one shell, either six or eight inches in diameter, that wounded two men on her bridge. She soon turned in pursuit along with other ships of the Russian fleet, all firing their forward guns, but she failed to score any hits. On 26 March 1904, Sevastopol was accidentally rammed by , damaging a propeller. After the attack on Port Arthur, the First Pacific Squadron tried to break out several times. During one attempt on 23 June, Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft, commanding the Pacific Fleet, retreated after encountering the Japanese fleet. Approaching the harbor, Sevastopol moved slightly out of formation and hit a mine that killed 11 and caused severe flooding, but managed to get inside the harbor and drop anchor. She was under repair for six weeks, during which time a fire broke out on deck, killing two and wounding 28. The Russian battleships were too big to fit into the dry dock at Port Arthur, so large caissons were built to provide access to the ships' hulls. On 9 August, with the Japanese Third Army assaulting the outer defenses of Port Arthur, the First Pacific Squadron sortied from its base. Even though Sevastopol was not fully repaired, she sailed with the rest of the fleet with one gun in her aft turret remaining inoperable. They later engaged the Japanese fleet in what would become the Battle of the Yellow Sea. Although in the center of the Russian line during the battle, Sevastopol was only slightly damaged during the day. In the evening, the Russians massed their fire on the Japanese flagship , at that time away. The Japanese battleships returned fire and Sevastopol suffered several shell hits to her superstructure, which killed one man and wounded 62 others. A few minutes later, Mikasa was hit by two shells and one shell from and Sevastopol, which caused 40 casualties. Soon after that, when it seemed that the Russians would be able to escape to Vladivostok, two 12-inch shells from penetrated the conning tower of the Russian flagship , killing Vitgeft and the helmsman, severely wounding the captain, and causing the ship to come to a dead stop after executing a sharp turn. Thinking that this was a maneuver planned by Vitgeft, the Russian line started to execute the same turn, causing all of the ships directly behind Tsesarevich, including Sevastopol, to maneuver wildly to avoid hitting the stationary flagship. Prince Pavel Ukhtomski, second in command of the squadron, who was on the Peresvet, proceeded to signal the other Russian ships via semaphore to steam back to Port Arthur, although the signals were only gradually recognized by Pobeda, Poltava, and Sevastopol. Sevastopol had one and two guns knocked out during the battle. Returning to Port Arthur on 10 August, the squadron found that the city was already under siege by the Japanese Third Army led by Baron Nogi Maresuke. On 23 August, Sevastopol bombarded a Japanese battery in an effort to escape along with nine smaller ships, but after she neutralized the battery, she returned to port after a Japanese lookout spotted the approaching ships. As she was maneuvering back into Port Arthur, she struck another mine and required repairs. On 5 December the Third Army captured 203 Meter Hill, a crucial position that overlooked the harbor. From there, the Japanese were able to fire on Sevastopol and other ships of the First Pacific Squadron that had survived the Yellow Sea battle. The ships at that time were about away from the hill, placing them within range of Japanese shore artillery. By 9 December four battleships and two cruisers had been sunk by the Japanese. Sevastopol, although hit five times by shells, managed to move away from the western harbor and out of range of the guns to the minor harbor of White Wolf, where she could be defended by torpedo nets and booms. Within the defensive surroundings of White Wolf, Essen started to plan a sortie through the blockade to Vladivostok or a rendezvous with the Second Pacific Squadron, at that time coaling at Madagascar. At the same time, the commanding admiral of the Imperial Japanese Navy, T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç, as instructed by Emperor Meiji in Tokyo, ordered the destruction of the battleship by six waves of destroyers, along with some torpedo boats that were launched from the and Mikasa. alt=A black and white shot of several ships lying submerged underwater in various states of capsizing, a white building is shown in the right corner of the foreground. The torpedo boat and destroyer attacks lasted three weeks, during which 80 torpedoes were launched at Sevastopol. Of these, four hit. The four successful torpedoes were launched on 18 December. Three of them hit the torpedo nets that had been placed around the ship, while the other hit one of the ship's propellers. Although severely damaged, Sevastopol remained afloat and sank two destroyers and damaged six others, killing 35 sailors and five officers. A Japanese cruiser attempting to attack Sevastopol was sunk by a mine in the harbor. When he received news of the surrender of the land fortifications on 2 January 1905, Essen decided to surrender, but scuttled the ship in of water by opening the seacocks on one side so that the ship could not be salvaged by the Japanese. His other option, a run to Vladivostok, had already been eliminated due to the damage to his propellers by the torpedo. For the act of scuttling Sevastopol, Essen was awarded the Order of St. George. Nevertheless, a dispatch from Tokyo reported that it sank as a result of a Japanese torpedo attack. Due to the depth of water in which she had sunk, and her position, Sevastopol was the only battleship that was not salvaged by the Japanese at Port Arthur. What remains of her is still outside the entrance to Port Arthur. Poltava, one of her sister ships, was also scuttled at Port Arthur and re-floated as the Japanese .

This battle was the culmination of a long confrontation between a large segment of the nobility and the people of Aragon against the king, ending with the decisive defeat of the Union.Merriman, Roger Bigelow, The rise of the Spanish Empire in the Old World and in the New, Vol.1, (MacMillan Company, 1918), 445. Background The start of direct conflict between the King of Aragon and much of the nobility and the towns of the kingdom went back to the year 1282, following the conquest of Sicily by Peter III and his excommunication by Pope Martin IV and subsequent Aragonese Crusade. To achieve more effective pressure on the king and protect each other, the nobility of Aragon signed the Oath of the Union, in which they pledged support for each other against the king of Aragon in the event he attempted to undermine their privileges. The first noble rebellion was later expanded to include the Union of Aragon and major cities, including the city of Zaragoza, capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. Following the meeting of the Cortes in Zaragoza in 1283, Peter III was forced to accept the demands of the General Privilege of the Union, which expanded in 1287 during the reign of his son Alphonso III regarding the privileges of the Union. The Union against Peter IV Peter IV had become king of Aragon in 1336, following the death of his father Alfonso IV. His first major domestic problem occurred in 1347 with the reactivation of the Union of Aragon. The original purpose of the confrontation was in Peter IV's decision to acknowledge his daughter Constance as heiress to the Crown of Aragon, which infringed the rights of the Infante James, his own brother.Previt√©-Orton, Charles William, The Shorter Cambridge Medieval History, (Cambridge University Press, 1978), 909. As acting Governor of Aragon, James immediately went to Zaragoza to seek the support of the Aragonese nobility against the royal decision. The rebelling nobles again swore allegiance to the Union in support of the Infante movement; to which the majority of municipalities soon joined, including the capital. There was also a similar Union organized in the Kingdom of Valencia. At first Peter IV sought to resolve the situation by resorting to diplomacy: Cortes convened in Zaragoza and gave their revocation of his decision and instead agreed to confirm the privileges of the Union of 1287. From that moment, the only possible solution was armed conflict. Following the Cortes decision, Infante James died in Barcelona, possibly poisoned by order of Peter IV. At the end of 1287, fighting occurred in the two kingdoms of Aragon and Valencia: First, the Union of Valencia defeated the royalists at Largo and B√©tera,Merriman, 445. but in Aragon, King Peter IV attracted major Aragonese nobles like Lope de Luna and the village communities of Daroca and Teruel to his aid. In early 1348, Peter IV managed to reach an agreement with the Valencian Union so that any military activity was concentrated thereafter in the Kingdom of Aragon. The battle By the spring of 1348 the Unionists had concentrated all their forces in Zaragoza, reluctant to work with the nobles who still supported the king. For his part, Lope de Luna attempted to take the city of Tarazona, a member city of the Union. In early July, Peter IV, with the kingdom of Valencia pacified and the support of the inhabitants of Teruel, Daroca and Calatayud, marched on Zaragoza intending to end the revolt. The Unionists, realizing they could not cope with the united forces of Peter IV and Lope de Luna, tried to cut them off, taking a central location that was in the hands of the royalists, the village of √âpila. Lope de Luna understood that if the Unionists took √âpila he would be blocked and unable to receive support from King Peter. Therefore, Lope de Luna immediately left the siege of Tarazona and force-marched towards √âpila to stop the Unionist Army. There followed the final battle on July 21, 1348. The contending armies=Royal Army 'In √âpila' * Blasco de Alagon. * Thomas Cornel. * Martin Lopez de Pomar-warden. 'Army of Lope de Luna'Merriman, 445. * Lope de Luna, with 400 knights. * Alvar Garc√≠a de Albornoz with 600 knights. * Daroca laborers. Union Army * Infante Ferdinand of Aragon. * Juan Xim√©nez de Urrea, lord of Biota. * Juan Xim√©nez de Urrea, captain of the Union. * Laborers in Zaragoza. * 15,000 men between knights and pawns. Development The battle began on the morning of July 21 with an attempt by Union troops, led by Juan Xim√©nez de Urrea, Jr., to occupy √âpila. Blasco de Alagon had taken refuge inside √âpila, his mission was to defend the place until the core troops of Peter IV joined with those of Lope de Luna. The frontal attack was very intense but the Unionists lacked sufficient troops to overcome the defenses and did not have time to prepare, knowing that Lope de Luna had left the siege of Tarazona and was marching towards Jal√≥n to force a confrontation. Repulsed at their first assault, the Unionists burned the crops and the suburbs in an attempt to force a showdown in the open. The center of the battle was the bridge over the Jal√≥n river. Unionists tried to hold it until Castilian mercenaries commanded by G√≥mez de Albornoz arrived. The inexperienced laborers of Zaragoza could not stop several hundred well armed and experienced horsemen. The Castilian mercenaries not only made their way to the other side but directly attacked the rebellious Aragonese nobles who remained in reserve. Some of the Aragonese immediately took flight as the Unionist troops were unable to halt the cavalry. Only those most committed to the noble cause entered the battle with the intention of withstanding until nightfall. But eventually resistance broke, causing the deaths or capture of the principal leaders of the Aragonese Union. Consequences The victory of the royalist troops at the battle of √âpila was complete and final. Those killed were the chief supporters of the Union; Juan Xim√©nez de Urrea, Lord of Biota, Tramacet Jimen Gombal and Perez de Pina. The prisoners were: Juan Xim√©nez de Urrea, son of the former, who had led the Union army in the action at Valencia and was executed a few days later; and Pedro Fernandez, Lord of H√≠jar. Infante Ferdinand himself, who had been captured by Castilian soldiers, was sent to Castile, fearing that Peter IV would order him executed. King Peter IV convened the Cortes in Zaragoza and awarded the title of \\"Count\\" to Lope de Luna, the first nobleman in Aragon to get this title without belonging to the royal family. On October 4, 1348, the Parliament of Aragon revoked all privileges and rights of the Unionists and Peter IV destroyed the documents of the collected privileges. However, the king extended the powers of the Justice of Aragon to mediate conflicts between the Aragonese and the monarch, so that much of the rights that the nobles, which had been attributed to the Union, were safeguarded in the figure of Justice and extended to all the Aragonese.

Life Fan Zeng was from Juchao (present-day Yafu Street, Juchao District, Chaohu City, Anhui). He had a keen interest in military strategy and politics. In 207 BC, when Fan Zeng was about 70, he left home to meet Xiang Liang, who had rebelled against the Qin dynasty, and was accepted by Xiang Liang as an advisor.Shiji vol. 7. After Xiang Liang died, Fan Zeng continued serving his nephew, Xiang Yu, as an advisor. Xiang Yu respectfully addressed Fan Zeng as his \\"Second Father\\" (‰∫ûÁà∂; Yafu). Since then, Fan Zeng had been planning and formulating strategies for Xiang Yu to overcome his rivals. In 206 BC, Fan Zeng followed Xiang Yu as their army entered Guanzhong (heartland of the Qin dynasty), where Fan Zeng noticed that Liu Bang would become a future threat to Xiang Yu. Fan Zeng constantly urged Xiang Yu to kill Liu Bang then, but Xiang did not heed his advice. During the Feast at Hong Gate, Fan Zeng ordered Xiang Yu's cousin Xiang Zhuang to pretend to perform a sword dance and use the opportunity to kill Liu Bang, who was present at the feast on Xiang Yu's invitation.

Liu Bang's strategist Chen Ping used a scheme to trick Xiang Yu into believing that Fan Zeng had the intention of betraying him. Xiang Yu fell for the ruse and dismissed Fan Zeng.

He came to attention in 2002 with the publication of Moral Darwinism: How We Became Hedonists.

The service has been popular with hosting viral images and memes, particularly those posted on Reddit. History The company was started in 2009 in Athens, Ohio as Alan Schaaf's side project while he attended Ohio University for computer science. Imgur was created as a response to the usability problems encountered in similar services. Designed to be a gift to the online community of Reddit, it took off almost instantly, jumping from a thousand hits per day to a million total page views in the first five months. Imgur became widely recognized following its rise to popularity on social media websites such as Facebook, Reddit, and Digg. In October 2012, Imgur expanded its functionality to allow users to directly share images to Imgur instead of requiring images to gain enough attraction through other social media sites like Reddit to show up on the popular image gallery. In the beginning, Imgur relied on donations to help with the web hosting costs. As the site grew, it needed additional sources of revenue to keep up with demand. Display ads were introduced in May 2009; sponsored images and self-service ads were introduced in 2013. In order to scale and manage its growth, Imgur used three different hosting providers in the first year before settling on Voxel, then switching to Amazon Web Services in late 2011. In January 2011, the company moved from Ohio to San Francisco. As of June 2013 they had 10 employees, and won the Best Bootstrapped Startup award at TechCrunch's 2012 Crunchies Awards. In 2016, Reddit introduced native image hosting, causing a notable decrease in Imgur submissions on the site. Funding In April 2014, five years after it was founded, Imgur raised $40 million from Andreessen Horowitz and Andreessen Horowitz's Lars Dalgaard joined Imgur's board.Perez, Sarah April 3, 2014. Techcrunch. \\"After Five Years Of Bootstrapping, Imgur Raises $40 Million From Andreessen Horowitz & Reddit\\" Imgur was profitable at the time, generating revenue from Pro subscriptions and advertising. April Fools' pranks Imgur has a history of playing April Fools' Day pranks on its users. The first prank in 2011 was the Catification feature, which allowed users to automatically add cats to any image with one click. The official Imgur mascot is the Imguraffe, which was created as an April Fools' Day prank, but was \\"too cute to give up\\", thereafter becoming the official mascot. On April 1, 2016, \\"Imgur for Pets\\" was added for the day. The category was pet pictures and gifs for pets. The voting system's icons of \\"Upvotes\\", \\"Downvotes\\", and \\"Favorite\\" (arrows facing up and down, and a heart, respectively) were changed into paws facing up and down and a bone, respectively. In April 2019 Imgur made yet another April Fools' Day joke by adding the \\"Meh\\" button along with the pre-existing \\"Upvote\\", \\"Downvote\\", and \\"Favorite\\" icons. The \\"Meh\\" button would vote neither up nor down a post, effectively giving it a +0. The \\"Meh\\" button was to be used \\"When you're plainly whelmed\\". Alan Schaaf, Founder and CEO of Imgur, in 2014 Popularity In 2013 Imgur overtook other image hosts in interest, such as Photobucket, ImageShack, and TinyPic, according to Google Trends [warning: non-statistical]. , it was ranked 16th among Alexa's Top Sites in the United States. In its first month Imgur had 93,000 page views. According to EdgeCast in 2012, Imgur's former content delivery network (CDN), Imgur served more images in 10 minutes than there are in the entire Library of Congress. In 2012 there were 300 million images uploaded, 364 billion image views counted and 42 petabytes of data transferred. Features=Albums Albums were introduced on October 11, 2010. Album layouts are customizable and embeddable. Accounts On January 9, 2010, Alan Schaaf introduced Imgur accounts, which allowed users to create custom image galleries and manage their images. Accounts gave full image management including editing, deletion, album creation and embedding, and the ability to comment on viral images and submit to the public gallery. Gallery profiles gave the user the ability to view their past public activity. According to the help section on imgur, there is no image upload limit per account, but there is an upload limit of 50 images per IP address per hour. Paid pro accounts were created in 2010 to remove these limitations and allow infinite image storage, as well as increased upload limits. Images Imgur used to have a policy to keep images unless they went three months without receiving any views, at which point (unless they were Pro account images) they might be removed in response to space needs. In early 2015, it was announced all images will be kept forever (even if not added from a Pro account) and only removed if deletion is requested. Meme Generator Since June 26, 2013, Imgur has provided a \\"Meme Generator\\" service that allows users to create image macros with custom text using a wide variety of images. Gallery The public Imgur gallery is a collection of the most viral images from around the web based on an algorithm that computes views, shares and votes based on time. As opposed to private account uploads, images added to the gallery are publicly searchable by title. Members of the Imgur community, self-proclaimed \\"Imgurians,\\" can vote and comment on the images, earning reputation points and trophies. Images from the gallery are often later posted to social news sites such as Huffington Post. Random mode was released on July 30, 2012 and allows users to browse the entire history of the public gallery randomly. GIFV Since October 2014, Imgur had automatically converted uploaded animated GIF files into WebM and MP4 video files, which are much smaller. Video to GIF In January 2015, Imgur allowed users to link video URLs to create GIFs directly through the website. This was geared towards allowing its users to create GIFs regardless of image editing knowledge. Topics In February 2015 Imgur announced \\"Topics\\" which was a quick way for users to sort and view specific images that belonged to a specific group determined by tags such as science, earth, or cats. Mobile apps In March and June 2015 Imgur introduced official mobile apps for iOS and Android, respectively. Trophies In order to reward users for their interactions, Imgur provides a series of Trophies for achievements including being a member of the community for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 years, \\"Best Post of the Day\\", \\"Best Post of the Month\\", \\"Best Post of the Year\\", \\"Top Comment of The Day\\", \\"Top Comment of The Month\\", and \\"Top Comment of The Year\\".  Community  Since the site's creation, Imgur's user community has significantly grown. Self-named \\"Imgurians\\" have created much content in an effort to bring the community even closer. At the beginning of 2015, Imgur's director of community Sarah Schaaf announced its first ever \\"Camp Imgur\\". Five hundred tickets were sold at $150 each. The camp was created as a celebratory event to bring users of the site together in August 2015, on a four-day retreat at Camp Navarro in Mendocino, California. It included hiking, stand-up comedians, and meetings with the staff of Imgur and other users. Some of Imgur's more well-known community members include former Mythbuster Adam Savage and Olympic athlete Cody Miller.  Data breach  On November 23, 2017, Imgur was notified of a potential security breach that had occurred in 2014 and affected the email addresses and passwords of 1.7 million user accounts. On the morning of November 24, 2017, Imgur began notifying affected users via their registered email address to change their password.

In 1940, Matthew Bullock became a member of the Bah√°'√≠ Faith. He went on to be elected Chairman of the Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Boston, and in 1947 presented ‚ÄòA Baha'i Declaration of Human Obligations and Rights' to the first session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. In 1952 he was elected to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States, a position that allowed him the opportunity to visit Haifa, Israel, where he met Shoghi Effendi. Describing this meeting, he said ‚ÄòMy visit to him and to the Holy Shrines are experiences beyond words. I don‚Äôt think I will ever be able to express what it meant to me‚Ä¶I wish every Baha‚Äôi could have the bounty which has been mine.‚Äô He was designated by Shoghi Effendi as a Knight of Bah√°'u'll√°h for the West Indies in 1953, and traveled extensively teaching the Bah√°'√≠ Faith in Haiti, Costa Rica, Mexico, the Belgian Congo, and Liberia during his remaining years.

Discovery is an American television program, produced by ABC News, that was geared towards children and teenagers. The program began on October 1, 1962 as a weekday afternoon series. In September 1963, the show moved to midday Sunday, and remained on the air until September 5, 1971. Overview The program was hosted by actor/announcer Frank Buxton and actress/vocalist Virginia Gibson. The show's original studio announcer was ABC staff announcer Bill Owen, who replaced Buxton as host in 1966, continuing through 1971. The shows hosted by Buxton were mostly studio productions, done in black-and- white. Beginning with Owen, the shows were produced in color, and involved much travel to on-site locations. The actual on-air title of the series was named according to each year it was produced, beginning with Discovery '62 and ending with Discovery '71 (syndicated reruns only had the title Discovery). The show's executive producer was Jules Power, the former co-producer of NBC's Mr. Wizard.New York Times obituary on Discovery executive producer Jules Power The Discovery format originally had Buxton and Gibson (joined by a hound dog named Corpuscle) in studio, exploring various topics in science, culture, history and the arts, often with special in-studio guests. Later seasons of the show had Buxton and Gibson (and later Owen and Gibson, and sometimes Gibson alone) traveling on location (without the dog) to different destinations around the world in a documentary format. Discovery was replaced in 1971 by Make a Wish, which in turn was replaced by Animals, Animals, Animals in 1976 (and ended in the summer of 1981). Accolades Discovery was nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program several times, winning in 1964.

Life and death Ruth Jackson was born on a farm near Scranton, Iowa and moved to Dallas, Texas at age 14. Jackson married, but divorced after 2 years so she could concentrate on her work. She died in the Baylor University Medical Center at Dallas in 1994 at the age of 91. Education and career Upon completing high school, Jackson told her parents she was planning to take premedical instruction at the University of Texas at Austin, but her father disapproved so she became a sociology major. She changed her major to premedicine before graduating in 1924 when she learned a father was unable to support his family because of a bad knee. Jackson was then motivated to learn how to prevent instances like that in the future. She earned her bachelor's degree in economics and sociology from the University of Texas at Austin, and her medical degree from Baylor College of Medicine in 1928, where she was one of four women in a class over 100 students. In her training as a med student, Jackson was not allowed to examine men and was told at orientation that the female students would need to score grades 10 points higher than the male students in order to graduate with \\"equal standing\\". Jackson graduated 8th in her graduating class of 1928. After graduation, intentions of pursuing a career as a general surgeon could not be fulfilled because general surgery internships were not available for women. In 1928, she found a rotating internship at the Worcester Massachusetts Memorial Hospital and returned in 1930 to continue her residency in orthopaedics after she accepted and carried out an opportunity to train in orthopaedic surgery in later 1928 under MD, Arthur Steindler (1878-1959) at the University of Iowa. After completing her residency in orthopaedics at Worcester, Jackson served as a resident physician for the Scottish Rite Hospital for Crippled Children in Dallas, Texas from 1931-1932. Dr. Jackson opened her own private practice in Dallas after she completed her residency in 1932. In 1933, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons was founded and would only allow Dr. Jackson, a female, into the academy if she passed the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery examination. She became board-certified by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons in 1937. Jackson joined the staff at the Baylor University Hospital in 1939 then soon became chief at the non-school orthopaedic service at Parkland Hospital and established the hospital's first orthpaedic residency. She later opened up her own private clinic in Dallas in 1945 where she practiced orthopaedics for the remaining 38 years of her career. Dr. Jackson was one of the founders of the Texas Orthopaedic Association in 1936. She stopped operating in 1974, but continued to examine patients until 1989. Jackson wrote the book \\"The Cervical Syndrome\\" based on her experiences of treating over 15,000 neck injuries, made numerous publications in medical journals, and invented the Jackson Cervi- Pillow to help victims of whiplash. In 1950, she was appointed to the Advisory Committee for Services to Crippled Children by Secretary of Labor, Frances Perkins. Dr. Jackson was an expert in problems of the foot and ankle and those of the cervical spine.Jackson, Patsy Mayes.

His book, written in Coptic, was later translated into Arabic and incorporated as the second part of the History of the Patriarchs of Alexandria., p. 16. John was a spiritual disciple of Bishop Moses of Awsim, one of the most revered Coptic churchmen of his age. The later historian Sawirus ibn al-Muqaffa ø made heavy use of John's Life, and although John is one of the only sources for the time and place, he is not always reliable. For instance, he records a Nubian invasion of Egypt that reached as far as Fustat in 745, after the Egyptians refused to release Michael, Patriarch of Alexandria. This event appears to be a conflation of a real invasion of Upper Egypt and the imprisonment and liberation of the patriarch, made to coincide with a known period of Coptic uprisings and consequent persecution at the instigation of the Caliph Marwan II. John is the only source to describe the dynastic struggles that followed the death c.730 of Merkurios, whom he refers to as a \\"new Constantine\\".

In 1965 the City of Pasadena and the City of Houston both annexed an area that included the site of Bayport resulting in a lawsuit between Pasadena and City of Houston. Houston was joined by Harris County and Humble Oil & Refining Company in the lawsuit. In 1969 the Supreme Court of Texas reversed lower court rulings that had sustained Houston's motion for summary judgment and upheld the validity of Pasadena's 1965 annexation of the disputed territory. In 1970 the City of Pasadena created an industrial district that included the Bayport complex. The development, created in 1970, is among the largest private industrial complexes in the United States. The leading center for chemical processing in the Houston area, Bayport contains more than 60 chemical plants. Businesses located in this district can receive tax incentives from Harris County, La Porte, and Pasadena. local business volume for Bayport-related enterprises exceeds $829 million annually with 11,000 jobs directly attributable to the complex. Additionally the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership estimates that for every job created within the complex approximately 3.79 related jobs are created on average outside the district. Thus the district represents a key economic pillar of the communities in the area.

He is perhaps best known for his book on Australian history, The Colonial Australians. John Hirst, writing in The Monthly in 2006, placed it on his brief list of the best Australian history books of all-time. Elsewhere, Hirst describes The Colonial Australians, as an \\"underrated\\" work that \\"explores... the nature of colonial society by examining its physical remains,\\" and Denholm as the historian who \\"best understands\\" the sense in which that the culture of a colony is as old as the culture of the mother country. He first came to national and international attention with his debut novel, The Last Blue Sea (1959), about the conflict between Australia and Japan during World War II. The novel, which emphasized the difficulty the Anzacs experienced in fighting in the heat and rain of New Guinea, has been called, \\"the classic short novel of the New Guinea campaign.\\" He also wrote The Hollow Woodheap (1962), and a notable short story The Barambah Mob (1963), a humorous (and often anthologised) cricketing tale. His book length essay, The Colonial Australians (1975) was a bestseller. The Last Blue Sea won the first Mary Gilmore Prize. Denholm was a scholarship boy at the Brisbane Church of England Grammar School. He fought in World War II with the 59th Battalion (Australia). Denholm was an adult learner who entered Queensland University in 1964, graduating in 1967. He went on to earn the PhD in history at the Australian National University in 1972.

If X is a piecewise-linear homology sphere but not a sphere, then its double suspension S2X (with a triangulation derived by applying the double suspension operation to a triangulation of X) is an example of a triangulation of a topological sphere that is not piecewise-linear. The reason is that, unlike in piecewise-linear manifolds, the link of one of the suspension points is not a sphere.

History  In 1893, Mikimoto K≈çkichi, a local entrepreneur, succeeded in producing cultured pearls on an island in Ise Bay called . In 1919, the island was sold by the town of Toba to Teikoku Kisen Shipping Company but was purchased back by Toba in 1927.

Created by Ken Sugimori, Snorlax first appeared in the Game Boy video game Pok√©mon Red and Blue, and subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise, spin-off titles, and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Snorlax is a large, bluish creature with closed slit eyes and a closed mouth that features two protruding upward teeth. Snorlax is voiced by Katsuyuki Konishi in the Japanese versions of the Pok√©mon anime and the Super Smash Bros. series of video games, and by Hitoshi Takagi and Mitsuru Ogata in the animated shorts Pikachu's Rescue Adventure and Pikachu & Pichu, respectively. In its English- language appearances, it was originally voiced by Michael Haigney, and later Eric Stuart. Known as the \\"Sleeping\\" Pok√©mon, Snorlax has been said to weigh over and, until Pok√©mon Ruby and Sapphire, was considered the heaviest known Pok√©mon ever discovered.Trophy: Snorlaxes love to sleep and love to eat: these portly Pok√©mon get grumpy if they don't get 888 pounds of food per day. After snacking out, they always nap. They have cast-iron stomachs and can eat moldy and even rotten food with no digestion problems. They are the heaviest Pok√©mon on record, weighing in at over 1,000 pounds. Since its debut, the Snorlax character has received a generally positive reception. Conception and characteristics Snorlax was one of several different designs conceived by Game Freak's character development team and finalized by Ken Sugimori for the first generation of Pocket Monsters games Red and Green, which were localized outside Japan as Pok√©mon Red and Blue. Called \\"Kabigon\\" in Japanese, Nintendo decided to give the various Pok√©mon species \\"clever and descriptive names\\" related to their appearance or features when translating the game for western audiences as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children. Basing the name off its constant sleeping spells, the species was renamed Snorlax, a portmanteau of the words \\"snore\\" and \\"relax\\". Snorlax is #143 in the Pok√©dex. It weighs 1,014.1 lbs. (or 460 kg), and is 6'11\\" tall (or 2.1 m tall). Snorlax is a noseless ursid-like Pok√©mon that has a cream-colored face, hands and feet, while the rest of its body is teal in color. Its head is also large, and it has two small canine teeth visibly protruding from its lower jaw. Its feet are large compared to most Pok√©mon, which assist its balance when it chooses to stand. Although Snorlax's arms are short in relation to its size, they are long enough to enable it to both grab food and eat. Snorlax has been said to weigh over 1,000 pounds, and for a time was considered the heaviest known Pok√©mon.Trophy: Snorlax love to sleep and love to eat: these portly Pok√©mon get grumpy if they don't get 888 pounds of food per day. After snacking out, they always nap. They have cast-iron stomachs and can eat moldy and even rotten food with no digestion problems. They are the heaviest Pok√©mon on record, weighing in at over 1,000 pounds. Due to having an enormous appetite, Snorlax will devour almost anything, even moldy and rotten food.Pok√©dex: Its stomach can digest any kind of food, even if it happens to be moldy or rotten. Thanks to its extremely strong digestive juices, Snorlax's stomach can dissolve any kind of poison. As a result, it can eat tainted food without worry.Pok√©dex: Its stomach's digestive juices can dissolve any kind of poison. It can even eat things off the ground. Despite its size, Snorlax is such a docile Pok√©mon that children use its large belly as a place to play. Snorlax has hidden potential to unleash tremendous power when holding the Snorlium Z item, however, which gives access to its signature Z-Move Pulverizing Pancake.Pok√©dex: Snorlax's typical day consists of nothing more than eating and sleeping. It is such a docile Pok√©mon that there are children who use its large belly as a place to play. Snorlax has a pre- evolution, Munchlax, which is obtainable via breeding a Snorlax that is holding Full Incense. Munchlax also sports a voracious appetite, and evolves into a Snorlax when it has a sufficiently high level of friendship with its Trainer. Appearances=In video games Snorlax's most notable role in the Pok√©mon games has been that of an inadvertent roadblock. In Pok√©mon Red, Blue, their \\"upper version\\" and their remakes, the player must obtain the Pok√© Flute in order to wake up either of the two Snorlax that block Routes 12 and 16. Snorlax reprises this role in Pok√©mon Gold, Silver, their \\"upper version\\" and remakes. In these games, the player must restore power to Kanto radio tower and then play the radio's Pok√© Flute channel in front of Snorlax in order to awaken it. Although there is only one Snorlax available to catch, another is used by Red, the protagonist of Red and Blue who acts as these games' final boss. In Pok√©mon XD: Gale of Darkness, a pre-evolution of Snorlax named Munchlax was introduced; however, Munchlax remained unobtainable until the release of Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl. In Pok√©mon X and Y, Snorlax is once again a roadblock, this time wandering to a bridge near Camphrier Town and sleeping there. One of Camphrier Town's locals mentions that it does this at least once a year. The Pok√© Flute must once again be obtained, but this time the player must give it to the owner of Shabboneau Castle so he can wake it up. In Pok√©mon Sun, Moon and their \\"upper versions\\", Snorlax is among the handful of Pokemon to possess a unique Z-Move. In Snorlax's case, it can use Pulverizing Pancake as long as it is holding Snorlium Z and knows Giga Impact. In Pok√©mon Snap, when using the Pok√© Flute, Snorlax stands up and dances to the music, which is a very high scoring picture. In Pok√©mon Ranger, Snorlax is seen sleeping throughout the game, effectively cutting off certain areas until later on. It eventually remains in a cave until the player completes the Ranger Browser. Snorlax is an NPC in Pok√©Park Wii: Pikachu's Adventure and its sequel, Pok√©Park 2: Wonders Beyond. Snorlax appears from a Pok√© Ball in the Super Smash Bros. series. Using Body Slam, it jumps up when it appears and slams into whomever it hits. In Melee, Snorlax is seen as a Pok√© Float that allows players to fight upon on its head and belly. In other media In the Pok√©mon anime, a number of Snorlax play various supporting roles in certain episodes. The first appearance of a Snorlax was in episode 41 - Wake Up Snorlax! - in which it becomes a roadblock to the next town Ash is traveling to. Ash Ketchum also captures one in Snack Attack! that was eating the grapefruits of the Grapefruit Islands. He uses it sporadically, mostly opting to use other Pok√©mon due to it constantly sleeping. Ash called upon it for the Sumo Conference in Ring Masters, and later used it to defeat Clair's Kingdra in their rematch. He also used Snorlax during the Johto League competition, first against Gary Oak where it quickly defeated Gary's Nidoqueen and Arcanine, but lost to Scizor. Snorlax then fought during Ash's following match against Harrison, defeating his Steelix and Hypno, though in the end it was defeated by his Houndoom. Snorlax later meets and gets to be friends with May's younger Munchlax. Most recently, Snorlax helped Ash earn the Guts Symbol from Greta in Wheel of Frontier by defeating her Hariyama with an Ice Punch and flattening her Medicham with Body Slam. In the Pok√©mon Adventures manga, Red catches a Snorlax, which he nicknames \\"Lax\\". Red caught Lax because he was blocking the road during a bicycle race. He is very gluttonous and is driven into a frenzy by the smell of honey. Later, after extensive training, Lax becomes one of the most physically powerful members of Red's team. In the film Pok√©mon Detective Pikachu, a Snorlax is seen sleeping on a road in Ryme City. Reception Snorlax has received generally positive reception from the media. IGN described Snorlax as \\"one of the most powerful Pok√©mon of all\\" in its own \\"peculiar way\\", noting its high strength and immobility when it decides to sleep. IGN editor \\"Pok√©mon of the Day Chick\\" called Snorlax the \\"single most popular non-evolver that isn't also a legendary out there\\". IGN also praised Snorlax as one of the best Normal types, alongside Tauros, calling it a \\"tank\\" and an effective Pok√©mon. In 2015, IGN ranked Snorlax as the 28th best Pok√©mon, with editor Lucas calling it \\"one of the most recognizable Pok√©mon\\". GamesRadar called the character a fan favorite, further describing it as \\"perhaps the most American of \\". Another GamesRadar editor also praised Snorlax, stating it \\"may be (and is) the greatest Pokemon of all time\\". While author Loredana Lipperini called Snorlax the \\"laziest Pok√©mon known\\", Media and the Make-believe Worlds of Children found that children could relate to the character and interpret aspects of themselves in a positive light, and described it as an icon for a state of regression, but also symbolizing powerful characteristics for children. Snorlax was ranked 8th in Complexs \\"The 50 Best Pokemon Up to Pokemon Crystal\\", with Elijah Watson saying Snorlax is \\"lazy as hell but surprisingly awesome\\". However, Snorlax has also received a mixed reception. USA Today described it as \\"a cat with a glandular disorder\\", whereas GameSpy has described it as \\"downright silly\\".

The ship was the first capital ship to be laid down by the Ottomans in more than a decade. She was to have a main armament of four guns, with an armored belt that was thick. Work proceeded on the ship very slowly, primarily the result of a lack of funds; after two years, only the frames for the hull had been erected, and by the time work stopped in 1906, the hull had been only partially plated. During the long construction period, the supports for the keel shifted, which distorted the structure and prevented completion. The unfinished ship was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1909. Design Abd√ºl Kadir was to have been the Ottoman Navy's first pre-dreadnought battleship. She followed a series of ironclad warships built in the 1860s and 1870s. In 1876, Sultan Murad V was deposed; the Ottoman Navy had played a role in the coup, which installed Abdul Hamid II on the throne. The new sultan was as a result suspicious of the navy, and attempted to reduce its power by withholding funding and ordering no new capital ships over the course of the following decade. By the late 1880s, however, the ships built by his predecessors were rapidly becoming obsolescent, especially compared to foreign designs like the British s. More importantly, the Greek Navy--a major rival of the Ottoman fleet--had ordered three ironclad battleships in 1885. These ships, though smaller than the older Ottoman ironclads, were kept in a much better state of readiness than the Ottoman vessels, which were left idle in the Sea of Marmara, with little maintenance done. In 1890, the Ottoman government authorized a large construction program that included two battleships based on the French , along with several cruisers and smaller vessels. The two Hoche-class battleships were not built; instead, a smaller design, to be named Abd√ºl Kadir, was ordered that year. Along with the elderly central battery ironclad , she would have been one of the largest ships in the Ottoman Navy. General characteristics and armor Abd√ºl Kadir was long, and had a beam of and a draft of . As designed, she would have displaced . She would have been powered by a pair of vertical triple-expansion steam engines each driving a screw propeller, with steam provided by six coal-fired boilers that were ducted into a pair of funnels. Both the engines and the boilers would have been manufactured by Tersane-i Amire. The engines were estimated to have been rated at , which should have provided a top speed of . The ship would have had a capacity of of coal. Abd√ºl Kadir was to have had an armored belt that was thick, and was to have been wide. The upper decks above the main belt would not have had any armor protection. The transverse bulkheads connecting the ends of the belt were to have been thick. Her main battery guns were mounted on barbettes that were thick. Armament The German firm Krupp had secured the contract to supply the ship's armament. Abd√ºl Kadir was designed to carry a main battery of four guns in two twin turrets on the centerline, one forward and one aft. The secondary battery was to have comprised six guns in casemates. Close-range defense against torpedo boats was to have been provided by a battery of eight /30 quick-firing (QF) guns and eight QF guns, all in single mounts. Her armament suite was rounded out with six torpedo tubes in above water mounts. By 1904, her planned armament had been revised, with the 28 cm guns replaced with four guns in single turrets, and the number of 15 cm guns increased to ten. The 8.8 cm guns were replaced with guns, and the number of 3.7 cm guns was increased to ten. Two of the torpedo tubes were removed. Construction Abd√ºl Kadir was laid down at the Imperial Arsenal in Constantinople in October 1892. Rather than use an actual slipway, the builders simply began laying the keel pieces on empty ground near the shipyard, using only a small number of wooden beams to support the structure. The slipway that had been used to build the ironclad was, for some reason, left unused. By 1895, the steel frames for her hull had been erected, but work proceeded very slowly and frequently stopped, primarily due to the chronically tight Ottoman budget. In 1897, for instance, work had been halted for some time, and the contemporary journal The Navy and Army Illustrated predicted that the ship would not be finished. Similar large-scale building projects during this period also fell apart due to lack of funds; a major construction program launched in the aftermath of the Ottoman Navy's poor performance in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 stalled after funds could not be appropriated for the new ships. By 1906, when work on Abd√ºl Kadir stopped for the last time, the hull had been only partially plated. By this time, the blocks that supported the hull during construction had shifted, which destroyed the keel. As a result, the unfinished ship was broken up on the slipway in 1909.

It is named after Bernard Baruch, a Wall Street trader, economic advisor during World War I and World War II, and confidant to six presidents. In 2013, the Baruch Houses were included in mayor Michael Bloomberg's 80/20 infill plan that would lease the development's open space to housing developers to create 80% market rate housing and 20% affordable housing. In 2015, under Bill de Blasio, the plan changed to 50/50 infill. The infill plan is intended to fund the $241.9 million the development needs for repairs. NYCHA tenants and affordable housing advocates oppose the plan. After Hurricane Sandy, NYCHA received $355 million from the city to repair properties damaged by the storm in 2017. The Baruch Houses improvements include new roofs, flood proofing, installation of full back-up power generators, new heat and hot water service, restoration of the playgrounds.

Minister of Security Aboubacar Sampil spoke of putting him on trial for the offense of insulting the President, but he was quickly released, apparently due to pressure from the West,\\"Guinea: Outspoken opposition leader released from jail\\", IRIN, 17 November 2003. after 21 hours in detention. Dor√© struck a defiant tone upon his release from prison: \\"This will not cower me into submission ... as a matter of fact I am now determined more than before to see an end to the regime of Cont√©. The Cont√© of today is not the Cont√© of 10 years ago. He has lost his energy to govern.\\" In an interview with IRIN, he said that he was held in \\"deplorable\\" conditions at a maximum security prison and that he \\"slept on an arm chair with [his] suit and shoes still on\\". At a news conference on 18 November 2003, FRAD denounced Sampil for \\"turn[ing] this country into a police state\\" and demanded a delay in the election, vowing to disrupt it if it was held as planned in December. On the same occasion, Dor√© thanked his supporters for their show of solidarity.\\"Guinea: Opposition hits back at security minister\\", IRIN, 19 November 2003. When Cont√©, who was easily re-elected, was sworn in for his new term on 19 January 2004, Dor√© said that it was \\"a sad day for Guinean politics\\", and he observed that several important regional leaders were not present for the occasion.\\"Guinea: Ailing Conte is sworn in for another seven term\\", IRIN, 20 January 2004. Dor√© expressed satisfaction with Cont√©'s decision to dismiss Moussa Solano from the government on 1 March 2004, saying that Solano was \\"the greatest obstacle to true democracy in this country\\".\\"GUINEA: Conte sacks economic team in reshuffle\\", IRIN, 2 March 2004. Activities during Cont√©'s last years (2005‚Äì2008) As Cont√©'s health was known to be failing, there was much speculation for years about what would happen upon his death. Dor√© stressed that the opposition parties needed to agree on a strategy for the post-Cont√© era. He also said that if the military took power after Cont√©'s death, it would \\"not be able to last more than a few months, because it will get no financial backing from the international community and will not be able to meet people's basic needs\\".\\"Guinea: Politics and Economy\\", IRIN, 10 January 2005. Later, on 10 September 2005, Dor√© read a statement on behalf of FRAD in which he described Cont√© as \\"an obstacle to Guinea's development\\" and urged him to resign: \\"You are not what the country needs. You are sick. You must make the wise decision to leave now before others make it for you.\\"\\"Guinea: Opposition calls for president's resignation\\", IRIN, 12 September 2005. Dor√© announced on 29 October 2005 that FRAD would participate in the December 2005 municipal elections; while he stressed that \\"there are no guarantees of fair play\\", he said that FRAD would nevertheless \\"show the international community that we are committed to helping our country go forward\\".\\"Guinea: Opposition throws hat into ring for local elections\\", IRIN, 31 October 2005. When Cont√© went to Switzerland for medical treatment in March 2006, Dor√© again called attention to the state of Cont√©'s health, saying that there was a legal requirement for the President to be sufficiently healthy to exercise his duties. He also said that the people deserved to know more about the situation and that \\"health bulletins should be published\\" to keep them informed.\\"Guinea: Ailing president in Switzerland for medical treatment\\", IRIN, 20 March 2006. Later in 2006, amidst negotiations concerning a planned parliamentary election in 2007, Dor√© reiterated that negotiations between the government and opposition were ultimately futile if an independent electoral commission was not established.\\"Guinea: President flown to Switzerland for new medical check\\", IRIN, 11 August 2006. Dor√© was alone among major opposition leaders in boycotting the March 2006 National Consultation, which proposed various reforms and a political transition. In January 2007, amidst a general strike backed by the opposition, Dor√© said that the people were outraged by Cont√©'s \\"arrogant show of impunity\\" in releasing two of his friends from prison. He also emphasized that the people were \\"fed up with living in a country where nothing works even when there is not a general strike. People have nothing to lose.\\"Alex Duval Smith, \\"Soldiers open fire on Guinea protesters\\", The Independent, 23 January 2007. Events since 2008 After nearly 25 years in power, Cont√© died on 23 December 2008. Speaking after the news was announced, Dor√© expressed sadness despite his opposition to Cont√©'s policies. He stressed that \\"it is essential that the institutions function correctly and that the provisions of the constitution be respected\\" in the course of a peaceful transition.Victor Omoregie, \\"Soldiers attempt coup after president dies\\", Vanguard, 24 December 2008. However, elements of the military seized power in a coup d'√©tat within hours, establishing the National Council for Democracy and Development (CNDD) as the ruling junta. Together with other opposition parties, as well as civil society groups and trade unions, the UPG then formed the Forum of Active Forces (Forum des Forces Vives, FFV), an opposition coalition that sought a quick transition to elections and civilian rule.\\"Bloody Monday: the September 28 massacre and rapes by security forces in Guinea\\", Human Rights Watch, December 2009, page 19. During that period, Dor√© played an important part in the opposition's talks with the CNDD and was spokesman of the FFV;Mathieu Bonkoungou, \\"Guinea's Camara to stay abroad, two proposed for PM\\", Reuters, 15 January 2010. he was considered particularly suitable for talks with the CNDD because he and CNDD President Moussa Dadis Camara were both native to the Foresti√®re region.Adam Nossiter, \\"After massacre, Guinea sees hope of lifted chains\\", The New York Times, 3 February 2010, page A1. In contrast to his earlier rhetoric, it was observed that by that point he had adopted a more \\"level-headed\\" tone. September 2009 violence Acting on behalf of the FFV, Dor√© met with CNDD President Camara on 19 September 2009 to explain the FFV's plans to hold a \\"peaceful rally\\" on 28 September. The rally was intended to demonstrate opposition to Camara's purported plans to stand as a presidential candidate in the planned elections. Camara expressed concerns, but after Dor√© assured him that the rally would be held inside a stadium and there would be no \\"protest marches\\", he gave permission for the rally to be held. Later, on 27 September, the junta banned any demonstrations on 28 September; nevertheless, the FFV went forward with its plans, saying that it had received no official rejection of its request.\\"Bloody Monday\\", pages 21‚Äì22. On the morning of 28 September, other opposition leaders met at Dor√©'s home before leaving to participate in the demonstration. Dor√© remained at home because Camara had sent a group of religious leaders to his home with a message for the opposition leaders, attempting to persuade them to call off the demonstration.\\"Bloody Monday\\", page 25. By the time Dor√© reached the 28 September Stadium for the demonstration, he was unable to enter it due to the number of people who had gathered; thus he was not present with the other opposition leaders on the stadium's podium and could not reach them to deliver Camara's message. From his position outside the stadium, Dor√© watched as the soldiers began to shoot the opposition supporters. According to Dor√©'s account, he was then assaulted by five soldiers from the Presidential Guard, two of whom had been ULIMO fighters, and was nearly killed before Captain Moussa Ti√©gboro Camara, who was Minister at the Presidency for the Fight Against Drugs and Organized Crime, intervened:\\"Bloody Monday\\", pages 44‚Äì46. :\\"I know they were ULIMO because they talked about how they had been looking for me a long time, because I had opposed them in Liberia. They wore gris-gris around their necks. They were on drugs, and stank of alcohol. They demanded my cell phone, money, and jacket. Then they beat me on the head, hands, and shoulders. The two began to argue back and forth how they should kill me‚Äîone said, \\"Let's shoot him,\\" and the other said, \\"No, let's cut his throat.\\" They spoke to me in French, but it was bad French. What saved me is that at that moment the gendarme Ti√©gboro arrived. They were getting ready to kill me, those ULIMO, but I was saved by Ti√©gboro, who told them, \\"Leave Mr. Dor√©.\\" Dor√©, while continuing to endure beatings from members of the Presidential Guard, was taken to a car by Ti√©gboro and driven away, along with the other opposition leaders, who had also been beaten. They were first taken to a clinic, but then moved to the gendarme headquarters when another commander threatened to kill them at the clinic. After a few hours, Dor√© and the other opposition leaders were taken to another clinic on Camara's orders. In the evening, a government delegation went to the clinic, apologized to the opposition leaders, and told them they were free to leave. Also on the evening of 28 September, while Dor√© was still at the clinic, his house was ransacked by soldiers, along with the homes of two other opposition leaders. Finding that Dor√© was not present, the soldiers looted the house of all its valuable possessions and vandalized it. Dor√© later said that he believed the attacks on the homes of the opposition leaders were intended \\"to kill us, ... to finish us off\\".\\"Bloody Monday\\", pages 66‚Äì67 and note 149. Transition Camara was shot and wounded during a leadership dispute in December 2009, and S√©kouba Konat√© then took his place in an acting capacity. Konat√© said that the opposition could choose a new Prime Minister to serve in the period leading up to a new election. On 15 January 2010, the FFV proposed two candidates for the post, Dor√© and the key union leader Rabiatou Serah Diallo, telling Konat√© to choose between them. Konat√©'s spokesman said that Dor√© and Diallo would need to travel to Ouagadougou for talks with Konat√©, the recovering Camara, and Burkinab√© President Blaise Compaor√©, who was acting as mediator.Romaric Ollo Hien, \\"Guinea seeks new prime minister after crisis deal\\", AFP, 16 January 2010.

Each candidate reportedly received 94 votes. Later, on 18 January, it was reported that the FFV had selected Dor√© as its sole candidate for the post of Prime Minister.\\"Guinea opposition picks activist for PM job\\", Reuters, 18 January 2010. The fact that Dor√© held a university degree was reportedly the deciding factor, although Diallo's union supporters were unhappy with the outcome. On 19 January 2010, the junta announced its designation of Dor√© as Prime Minister, while citing \\"his experience [and] his knowledge of Guinean politics\\". He was to lead a 30-member government over the course of a six-month transitional period, which was to conclude with an election; Dor√© emphasized that the essential purpose of his government would be \\"to make the election a fair election\\".Ricci Shryock, \\"Guinea's Interim Prime Minister Wants New Government This Week\\", VOA News, 20 January 2010.

He said on the occasion that he was \\"committed to leading Guinea toward free, credible and transparent elections\\". The process of determining the composition of the new government proved time-consuming, as the various political elements struggled to obtain ministerial posts. Dor√© consequently faced some criticism for not acting quickly enough. Some also expressed concern regarding the possibility that Dor√© might stand as a presidential candidate; his own statements on that possibility were unclear.Saliou Samb and Mark John, \\"Government wrangling delays Guinea power transition\\", Reuters, 3 February 2010. Dor√© stressed that forming a government was difficult when he had to satisfy so many different elements and that it would \\"take some time\\". Speaking at a press conference on 2 February, he said that a rushed process would produce \\"an indigestible dish\\". He also explained that Konat√© had told him to choose ministers who met \\"three criteria: competence, not being under international sanctions, and taking into account ethnic balance\\".\\"We will not be rushed, says Dore\\", Sapa-AFP, 3 February 2010. Dor√©'s government, composed of 34 members, was eventually appointed on 15 February 2010. As planned, portfolios were allotted to members of both the CNDD and the FFV.

During the construction of the Pieman River hydro electric scheme in the late 1970s the line was diverted in places and new bridges were built. The Emu Bay Railway was included in the October 1984 sale of EZ Industries to North Broken Hill Peko, which in 1988 merged with CRA Limited to form Pasminco. In 1989, an 11 kilometre branch from Moorey Junction opened to serve Aberfoyle's Hellyer Mine. On 22 May 1998, the company was purchased from Pasminco by the Australian Transport Network and integrated into its Tasrail business.ATN grabs Emu Bay The Examiner 7 April 1998\\"Tasrail to take over Emu Bay Railway\\" Railway Digest May 1998 page 16ATN Officially Adds Emu Bay Rail Operation to Its Tasrail Business Tranz Rail Holdings 22 May 1998 Passenger services The Emu Bay Railway operated passenger services for its employees and, later, tourists.

Due to an increase in tourist traffic, a service named The West Coaster was introduced between Burnie and Rosebery in October 1960. It was operated by two previously-stored D√ºbs and Company-built 4-8-0 steam locomotives, given the names Murchison and Heemskirk.

The airline operated for 21 years. In 1996 the airline was rebranded and renamed to Rwanda Air which finally led to the formation of RwandAir in 2002. History= Founding  Air Rwanda founded by the government of Rwanda on 15 July 1975 as the national airline of Rwanda. The airline began operations on domestic flights and to neighbouring nations, with a network including flights from Kigali to Gisenyi, Kamembe, Bujumbura and Ostend. Other services were also operated to Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire, along with a scheduled cargo flight from Bujumbura to Mombasa in Kenya. A fleet comprising one Boeing 707, two de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters and one Piper Aztec was operated on these routes. The airline would also occasionally lease a Britten-Norman Islander for operations from the Rwandan Air Force.  Libyan controversy  The airline was implicated in a mooted deal with Libya, under which the Libyans would paint Boeing aircraft belonging to Libyan Arab Airlines in Air Rwanda livery. The purpose of the deal was to allow the Libyans to skirt an embargo and to gain access to spare parts for the aircraft. The possible deal came to light when the United States gained photos of some Libyan aircraft being repainted in Air Rwanda livery, after which the Rwandans cancelled talks with the Libyans.  Re-branding  In 1994, the airline was forced to cease flying to domestic destinations because of the Rwandan genocide, whilst internationally the airline reduced its network to include only Kigali, Bujumbura and Entebbe. In 1996, the airline was renamed to Rwanda Air and its fleet consisted only of the Boeing 707. At this time its network only included Gisenyi, Kamembe, Bujumbura, Ostend, Dar es Salaam, Entebbe and Kinshasa. = Alliance Express Rwanda = In November 1997, it was announced that Alliance Express, the regional arm of multi-national Uganda-based airline SA Alliance Air, had reached a deal with the Rwandan government to take over the operations of Rwanda Air, after which it would operate as Alliance Express Rwanda from 1 March 1998. The new airline operated on routes from Kigali to Entebbe, Kinshasa, Johannesburg and Nairobi with Boeing 737-200 equipment. The government continued to hold a majority 51% share in the airline, with Alliance Air taking a 49% stake. The airline began operations to Bujumbura in neighbouring Burundi on 8 February 1999. In its first year of operations Alliance Express Rwanda posted a US$4 million operating loss on US$6 million revenues, which the airline blamed on its inability to operate flights to the Democratic Republic of the Congo due to the Second Congo War. A dispute between Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, according to the airlines' deputy managing director, meant the Kigali-Lubumbashi-Kinshasa route could not be developed. By this time, the airline was also operating a Bombardier Dash 8 in addition to the 737. = Government Takeover = After the Ugandan-based SA Alliance Air ceased operations in October 2000, the Rwandan government entered into an agreement with South African Airways to ensure the Rwandan subsidiary would continue to operate. Operations continued until the company was eventually wound up on 30 November 2002 and its operations taken over by Rwandair Express, later to be rebranded as RwandAir.

In a long career she acted with the Old Vic Company, the Royal Shakespeare Company and on Broadway. She directed plays for the Old Vic, became head of the Old Vic Theatre School and then director of the Bradford Civic Playhouse, with its associated Northern Theatre School. Career In 1916, after training at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and RADA, at the invitation of Lena Ashwell, she joined a concert party entertaining troops in France and, at the end of World War I, Germany. Among Church's earliest London appearances was a series of poetry recitals at the √Üolian Hall in 1920. In the following year she was in The Child in Flanders by Cicely Hampton at the Lyric, Hammersmith, the first of several London seasons with the Lena Ashwell Players. In 1926 she progressed, with \\"high distinction\\", to the title role of a bored housewife in Jane Clegg by St. John Ervine at the Century Theatre. In 1927 she joined Lilian Baylis' Old Vic company; for her first season she played in Ibsen, Shakespeare (as Viola in Twelfth Night, Lady Macbeth opposite John Laurie, Mistress Page in The Merry Wives of Windsor and Gertrude in Hamlet) and Sheridan's Mrs Malaprop. In 1931 she joined the Greyhound Theatre, Croydon, as artistic director, a position she held for two years before returning to the West End in a company headed by Tyrone Guthrie, with a long run in Dorothy Massingham's The Lake. Later in 1933 she again performed Gertrude, in William Bridges-Adams's production of Hamlet at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, opposite Anew McMaster. Regular London acting engagements, including some film work, continued until October 1936 when, at Baylis's invitation, she returned to the Old Vic to direct Michael Redgrave and Edith Evans in a celebrated production of As You Like It. This was followed by Ghosts, an Old Vic production staged at the Vaudeville Theatre, which was presented for television later that year. Teacher At same time as directing, both at the Old Vic and in West End theatres, Church organised new ventures: the Old Vic Theatre School and \\"Young Vic\\", a touring company aimed at young audiences and forerunner of today's theatre of the same name. In 1944 Church took the position of artistic director at the Bradford Civic Playhouse, a career development which initially caused puzzlement, but the move gave her the opportunity to found her own school, the Northern Theatre School at 26 Chapel Street, using the theatre facilities. The school's reputation grew rapidly and many notable actors trained there. Her students included Tom Bell, William Gaunt, Dorothy Heathcote, Bernard Hepton, Donald Howarth, Bryan Mosley, Edward Petherbridge, Robert Stephens and Billie Whitelaw. Church still found time for other work, returning to London to act and direct. In 1955, once again directed by Guthrie, she appeared as Flora Van Husen in a production of The Matchmaker, transferring from the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane to the Royale, New York. Her last appearance was in 1962 as Madame de Rosemond in The RSC's The Art of Seduction, a version from John Barton of Les Liaisons dangereuses, at the Aldwych Theatre. She retired firstly to Kent and then to Quenington, Gloucestershire, where she died.

Each party is given one color and one slice, and are arranged in descending order of votes. The parties that did not win a seat is given a single slice and color (gray). plurality of the vote in each province. Note that election is not via per province but nationwide as a single at-large \\"district\\". The 2010 House of Representatives of the Philippines party-list election was on May 10, 2010. The whole country was one at-large district, where parties nominate three persons to be their candidates, ranked in order of which they'll be seated if elected. The elected representatives will serve in the 15th Congress. Candidates from the district elections are not allowed to be nominated by the parties participating in the party-list election, nor are parties who have candidates in the district elections may be allowed to join the party-list election; the parties in the party-list election must represent a distinct \\"sector\\" in the society such as women, laborers and the like. In the election, the voter elects the party, not the nominees of the party; a voter may not be able to influence how the nominees are listed on election day, except for joining the party beforehand. If the party surpasses 2% of the national vote, the person first nominated by the party will be seated. Additional seats can be won by multiplying the percentage of the votes the party got, with the difference of number of seats the party already has (1), and the number of seats allocated for sectoral organizations (57), disregarding decimals, with no party getting more than two additional seats. However, usually only the party with the most votes gets the two additional seats, the other parties will get only one additional seat. If the number of seated representatives is less than the 20% quota of party-list representatives in Congress (57 for the 15th Congress), the unfilled seats will be filled up by the remaining parties in descending order of votes garnered until are seats are filled up. Note that with more than a hundred parties participating, and with the three-seat cap, the seats that the parties with 2% of the vote or more will always be less than the 20% allocation. Background Prior to the election, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) expected an increase of party-list organizations seeking accreditation from the 153 organizations that applied for accreditation during the 2007 elections. The COMELEC also de-listed 25 party-list organizations for either failing to participate in the last two elections or did not obtain two percent of the votes cast. However, the COMELEC said the two percent vote requirement does not cover the organizations that won a congressional seat based on a recent Supreme Court ruling. Militant groups Migrante and Sanlakas protested such de-listment, saying that they were not covered by the 2% rule, and that such rule is unconstitutional. Another 8 such organizations also filed a motion for reconsideration or a verified opposition against their de-listment. After purging the party-list roster, the COMELEC then acted upon the organizations that filed their manifestations of intent to run. LGBT group Ang Ladlad appealed their disqualification after the COMELEC's First Division disqualified the organization due to \\"moral grounds,\\" citing the Bible and the Qur'an. Party leader Danton Remoto, a professor at Ateneo de Manila University, cited the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as reasons why Ang Ladlad should be re-instated. Remoto would then appeal to the commission en banc. The COMELEC also disqualified Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) and government employees union Courage. The commission's First Division disqualified ACT after it had failed to prove that it exists \\"in most of the regions;\\" the commission said that, Courage on the other hand, \\"exists in Western Visayas, Davao del Sur, a town in Lanao del Norte and Rizal and some cities in Metro Manila,\\" and that it failed to prove that it represents a \\"marginalized and under-represented sector.\\" In December, the commission en banc denied Ang Ladlad's motion for reconsideration with finality as Remoto said he would elevate the case to the Supreme Court. In January 2010, the Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order to the COMELEC on disqualifying Ang Ladlad. With the COMELEC prevented from disqualifying Ang Ladlad, the organization along with 143 others were included in the final list of accredited party-list organizations, although the status may change if the court sides with COMELEC on the issue. Under Resolution 8745, six additional party-list groups were accredited, bringing the total to 150. The party-list election has been hit by allegations that several parties are fronts by the ruling administration. Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (BAYAN), a coalition of left-leaning party-lists, and election watchdog Kontra Daya said that nine party-lists were connected to the Arroyo political family. The parties and their first nominee cited were: *Ang Galing Pinoy, a party that claims to represents security guards: outgoing second district of Pampanga congressman Mikey Arroyo. Arroyo, the son of president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo willingly dropped his intention to run in Pampanga's 2nd district to let his mother run. *Transport group 1-UTAK: Secretary of Energy Angelo Reyes *Pilipino Association for Country ‚Äì Urban Poor Youth Advancement and Welfare (PACYAW), which claims to advocate sports development in the country: former Tourism assistant secretary Janet Lazatin as its first nominee *Kabalikat ng Mamamayan (KABAYAN) The administration distanced itself from the six pro-government parties insisting it has not endorsed any group supposedly to augment the administration's representation in Congress, saying that \\"it is up to the COMELEC to judge and issue a decision on the matter.\\" On April 8, 2010, the Supreme Court ruled that Ang Ladlad was allowed to run in the 2010 election, saying with a unanimous vote that what is immoral is not necessary illegal. Results On May 31, the leading parties in the party-list election were declared by the commission as winners; deferred are the parties (not nominees) that have pending disqualification cases against them. Ang Galing Pinoy's proclamation, the party of incumbent Pampanga 2nd district representative Mikey Arroyo was recalled as Arroyo has a pending disqualification notice against him, and he is their #1 nominee. The winners were: *3 seats: # Ako Bicol *2 seats each: #Coalition of Associations of Senior Citizens in the Philippines #Akbayan Citizens' Action Party #Gabriela Women's Party #Cooperative NATCCO Network Party #Abono #Bayan Muna #An Waray #Buhay *1 seat each: #Agricultural Sector Alliance of the Philippines #Alliance for Barangay Concerns #Butil Farmers Party #Anakpawis #Kabataan #Abante Mindanao #Alliance of Concerned Teachers #Youth Against Corruption and Poverty #Kasangga sa Kaunlaran #Bagong Henerasyon #Ang Galing Pinoy #Agbiag!

Seats in parenthesis indicates the number of seats to be won by the party pending disqualification cases, while parties highlighted are disqualified prior to the election. Aftermath On July 11, 2010, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) disqualified two nominees of Kasangga sa Kaunlaran namely Teodoro Haresco and Eugenio Lacson on proving they do not support the marginalized sectors. Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (BAYAN) secretary-general Renato Reyes says that \\"this should now serve as a benchmark for other pending petitions against party-list nominees who do not belong to nor represent the marginalized sectors.\\" On July 20, 2010, the COMELEC allowed Rep. Arroyo to sit as the representative for Ang Galing Pinoy after he was accepted as the first nominee of the party-list group. The Commission voted 4‚Äì2 while one abstained. The COMELEC also proclaimed three more parties as winners: A TEACHER, Butil Farmers Party and 1-UTAK, although the latter's first nominee, Angelo Reyes, was not allowed to take office as he has a pending disqualification case. While the commission upheld Angelo Reyes nomination by 1-UTAK, on late July, the party withdrew Reyes from their list after the commission's decision was appealed. Reyes, who was prohibited from having his seat at the House of Representatives, appealed to the Supreme Court. With the suicide of Reyes, the Supreme Court dismissed Reyes' petition. The Supreme Court dismissed petition filed by the Alliance for Barangay Concerns (ABC) on their disqualification by the commission, on March 22. The commission's decision, in which ABC was disqualified for being a front of the Members Church of God International, a religious group that produces the Ang Dating Daan television program, was upheld as it stated that the constitution gave the commission the power to register and cancel the registration of party-list groups. The commission originally dismissed the petition filed by lawyer and journalist Melanio Mauricio, Jr. in 2010, but was reconsidered on August 2010; ABC has already won a seat in Congress but has not been sworn in. ABC, through its chairman James Marty Lim, argued that since the party had already won a seat, the jurisdiction should be under the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal. However, the court ruled that commission maintains jurisdiction as the case does not refer to qualifications of members of Congress.

Upon its adoption in 1974, Hawaii became the first U.S. state to require minimum standards of health care benefits by law. Hawaii State Rep. Yoshito Takamine, the longtime chairman of the House Labor Committee, was one of the law's chief architects and proponents. Among other things, Hawaii's law requires employers to offer coverage to employees working at least 20 hours per week for four or more consecutive weeks. In contrast, the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires employers to offer coverage to employees working at least 30 hours per week effective Jan. 1, 2014. The two laws also establish different penalties for employers that do not offer coverage. Before the passage of the Prepaid Health Care Act, Hawaii had an uninsured rate of 30%.

The 2010 Tonight Show conflict was a media and public relations conflict involving American television network NBC and two of its then-late-night talk show hosts, Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno. Leno, the host of long-running franchise The Tonight Show since 1992, and O'Brien, host of Late Night since 1993, were strong ratings leaders for the network for much of the decade. When O'Brien's contract neared its end and he was courted by other networks in 2001, NBC extended his contract and guaranteed him he would be the fifth host of The Tonight Show. The network neglected to let Leno know this until his contract extension in 2004, when they informed him he would remain host for five more years and then transition the show to O'Brien in 2009. When that time arrived, other networks conveyed interest in Leno; NBC, in an effort to keep both of its late-night stars, offered Leno a nightly primetime show before the local news and O'Brien's Tonight Show. The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien and The Jay Leno Show failed to attract immediate viewers, and NBC affiliates, seeing their viewership decline, grew restless. NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Zucker, alongside chairman Jeff Gaspin and executive Rick Ludwin, created a remedy: move Leno back to his 11:35 pm start time and bump O'Brien a half-hour later, to 12:05 am. O'Brien and his staff were disappointed and furious; when it became clear O'Brien would not agree to the proposed changes, the situation grew heated. Though not a breach of either host's contract, the change resulted in a public outcry and public demonstrations largely in support of O'Brien. O'Brien's public statement that he would \\"not participate in the destruction of The Tonight Show\\" led to negotiations with NBC for a settlement. O'Brien and his staff received (equivalent to about $M in ) to walk away from the network, with his final Tonight Show airing January 22, 2010; Leno was reinstated as host that March, while after a contractual seven-month ban on appearing on television, O'Brien moved to TBS to host Conan. The controversy surrounding the scheduling move and the reinstatement of Leno was described by media outlets as \\"embarrassing\\" for the network and a \\"public relations disaster\\".ABC News article: \\"NBC's Talk Show Wars Seen as PR Disaster for All\\". Background NBC was a late-night ratings leader for years prior to the conflict. On May 22, 1992, Johnny Carson, host of NBC's The Tonight Show for nearly 30 years, retired from the program at the age of 66. The network signed Jay Leno, Carson's \\"permanent guest host\\", to become the program's fourth host upon Carson's exit. Carson clearly held the view the position should be given to David Letterman, host of his own program, Late Night, which had directly followed Carson's Tonight Show for ten years. NBC tried to appease both stars, but Letterman left the network in a very public conflict that resulted in the creation of his own competing show on CBS, which began in 1993. Late Show with David Letterman, \\"the first truly substantial competing franchise to Tonight\\", regularly won in the Nielsen ratings against Leno for two years, \\"proving for the first time that late-night television‚Äîand the profits that came with it‚Äîcould exist beyond The Tonight Show.\\" Leno's Tonight Show started rocky; prior to Letterman's move, NBC considered matching CBS's offer to allow Letterman to take over from Leno. Letterman beat Leno for nearly two years until August 1995, when Leno welcomed Hugh Grant, who had recently been arrested for soliciting a prostitute (\\"What the hell were you thinking?\\", Leno asked, to applause), to a previously-booked appearance on Tonight. From that point on, Leno beat Letterman in the ratings, and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno remained number one for the next 14 years (for Leno's entire run). NBC chose to continue the Late Night franchise, and at the suggestion of Saturday Night Live producer Lorne Michaels, hired Conan O'Brien, a relatively unknown writer for SNL and The Simpsons, to take over the time slot beginning in late 1993. Late Night with Conan O'Brien was constantly at risk for cancellation in its early years; at one low point in 1994, NBC threatened to put him on a week-to-week contract. Executives were anxious to replace him with Greg Kinnear, who followed O'Brien with Later at 1:30 am., but Kinnear left to pursue a career in acting later on. Interns filled empty seats in the audience while affiliates began to inquire about replacement hosts. Things improved for the show slowly (mostly revolving around O'Brien's performance) and by 1996, O'Brien's audience, largely young and male (a coveted demographic), grew steadily and the show began to beat competitors in the ratings, which it would continue to do for 15 years. A notable episode of O'Brien's tenure at the show came when Letterman asked to appear as a guest and say some kind words to him.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oksYO5TV48 O'Brien considered this the turning point that changed everything for him, which he mentioned while paying tribute to Letterman in an opening monologue of his own talk show on TBS, which aired the same night as Letterman's final show; O'Brien notably asked his viewers to turn him off and watch Letterman later on in the monologue.Conan, May 20, 2015 Early history=Contract renewals (2001‚Äì2004) Near the turn of the millennium, NBC's late-night lineup‚ÄîLeno at 11:35, O'Brien at 12:35, and Saturday Night Live on the weekend‚Äîremained a leader in the ratings. By 2001, O'Brien's contract at NBC had less than a year left to run, and despite arguably \\"coming into his own\\" in the preceding years, the network was reluctant to pay him on the same scale as other late- night hosts. That year, competing network Fox mounted an \\"extended, comprehensive campaign\\" to lure O'Brien away from NBC, viewing his style suitable for Fox's image‚Äî\\"young, hip, somewhat subversive\\". News Corporation chairman and CEO Peter Chernin pursued O'Brien personally, taking him and executive producer Jeff Ross to dinner on several occasions. Fox's plan involved making O'Brien the network's signature star: his program would begin 30 minutes before Leno's and Letterman's (the network's local news broadcasts aired earlier than other networks, allowing the head start) and he would receive cross-promotion via its animated division and on Sunday NFL games. Chernin also offered the host seven times his current pay (a jump from US$3 million to US$21 million). Ross, friends with NBC president and CEO Jeff Zucker, informed him that Fox was aggressively pursuing O'Brien; NBC returned with a more realistic offer, bumping up O'Brien's salary to US$8 million and renewing him through 2005. While many of O'Brien's professional advisors and managers pushed for the Fox deal, O'Brien's desire to one day perhaps take over The Tonight Show after Leno made it a difficult decision (O'Brien, like many comedians, had grown up idolizing Carson's incarnation). Chernin warned O'Brien that waiting around for Leno to leave would be \\"only an invitation to long-term disappointment, and potentially a path toward undermining a promising career.\\" Nevertheless, O'Brien signed a new deal with NBC in March 2002; the contract extended him through 2005 and most significantly contained an \\"explicit Prince of Wales clause\\" that solidified the official line of succession: If anything were to happen to Leno, O'Brien would step in. O'Brien's successful hosting job at the 2002 54th Primetime Emmy Awards \\"sent out the most resounding message yet about his growing strength as a performer\\", and a year later, NBC broadcast O'Brien's tenth anniversary special in primetime. By the time Leno's contract again came up for renewal, a discussion would be needed regarding the future of The Tonight Show. Facing the prospect of attempting to keep both Leno and O'Brien, Zucker made the final call on Leno's deal: \\"Yes, we'll extend your deal. But this is your last contract. Time to hand over the keys.\\" The plan would extend Leno four additional years, after which he would give The Tonight Show to O'Brien. In February 2004, NBC executive Marc Graboff informed Ross of the conversations, and he in turn ran the idea of waiting four more years to O'Brien, who was immediately receptive. Zucker, along with top late-night executive Rick Ludwin, met with Leno in March at his Burbank studio to discuss the contract extension, and explained the network's stance on handing over the show to O'Brien. While Leno quietly felt both disappointed and befuddled, he noted he did not want to see himself and O'Brien go through the same dilemma he and Letterman faced twelve years earlier, and agreed to the plans. His only request was that NBC wait to announce O'Brien's installment as host well after the extension, to which the executives agreed. While Leno handled the news professionally (to Zucker's relief), he soon headed to Tonight Show producer Debbie Vickers' office to let her know he felt as if he had just been fired. NBC's announcement of the renewal inevitably led to press speculation on O'Brien's fate; to that end, O'Brien and his team went with the charade, peppering interviews with unclear, vague statements on his future. On September 27, 2004, O'Brien officially signed on to become the next host of The Tonight Show; NBC allowed the first comment aside from the press release to come from Leno on that night's show. \\"'Cause this, you know, this show is like a dynasty,\\" Leno said. \\"You hold it, and then you hand it off to the next person. And I don't want to see all the fighting and all the 'Who's better?' and nasty things back and forth in the press. So right now, here it is‚ÄîConan, it's yours! See you in five years, buddy!\\" Losing Leno (2005‚Äì2008) Jeff Zucker, former CEO of NBCUniversal, was at the forefront of the conflict. Leno was, in reality, overcome with incredulity; in private conversations, he likened the situation to a relationship, noting that he was loyal and still ended up \\"heartbroken\\". From his perspective, the situation made no sense, as they had remained number one in ratings and consistently brought in money. He began frequently lamenting his confusion to producer Vickers, explaining that he was \\"sick of lying\\" when people inquired on his retirement. Eventually, he began mulling over his options after Tonight, telling his staff that after the transition, they could simply move to ABC and work at the Disney lot not far from their current Burbank studio. His frustration with the situation came across in his nightly monologues, as more jokes regarding NBC's fourth-place position in the ratings, as well as jokes regarding the future transition, began to appear. While NBC executives tended to not worry in the immediate years following the decision, by 2007 Zucker began to ponder what losing Leno might mean for the network. Around this time, Fox and ABC began to court Leno privately, conveying interest and holding discreet conversations. More offers for Leno had sprung up (including a lucrative one for a syndicated program by Sony Pictures Television), and in early 2008, Zucker began to make trips to the Burbank studio in an effort to keep Leno. He gave him numerous suggestions, including a Bob Hope-type deal (high-profile specials), a Sunday night primetime show, or even a nightly cable show on USA Network (owned by NBCUniversal). Executives began to entertain an ideal solution‚Äîpay off O'Brien and retain Leno‚Äîbut Zucker viewed the idea as \\"outrageous\\". By this time, NBC had already broken ground on a new studio for O'Brien's Tonight Show, renovating Stage 1 at the Universal lot in Universal City, for a reported US$50 million. During a spring lunch meeting with Jeff Ross, NBC sports chief Dick Ebersol advised that O'Brien retire silly antics (such as his signature \\"string dance\\") and focus more on pitching his show to middle America, which would involve stretching out his monologue. O'Brien, then a year away from inheriting the sacred ground of The Tonight Show, was indeed lengthening his monologue, but viewed suggestions from Ludwin as largely unnecessary: \\"I think people are overthinking the twelve-thirty-to-eleven-thirty shift\\", he said, instead desiring to put his own stamp on the show's tradition. By this point, O'Brien's popularity, sky high at the time of the contract signing, had gone down slightly. He had opted not to change his act to suit a more mainstream audience (as NBC imagined he would), and CBS's Craig Ferguson, who occupied the post-Letterman slot, had begun to occasionally trump O'Brien in overall ratings. Though internal anxiety increased among executives, most tended to still support O'Brien. Zucker's last resort for Leno was a nightly 10 pm program. As ratings had slipped entirely for 10 pm shows on NBC, he imagined a nightly Leno at 10 could perhaps produce a \\"paradigm shift\\" and reverse NBC's fortunes. On December 8, 2008, Leno verbally agreed to stay at the network‚Äîproducing a nightly 10 pm variety show titled The Jay Leno Show‚Äîand phoned ABC and Fox to inform them. Zucker and Ludwin planned to meet with O'Brien later to explain the deal, but as word leaked out to The New York Times, they decided to meet with him directly following that night's show. Following the meeting, Ross and O'Brien met with writers and mulled over the decision. O'Brien instantly felt uneasy, but as he was still in essence receiving The Tonight Show, he remained calm. Late Night with Conan O'Brien officially signed off the following February, followed by The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on May 29.Elber, Lynn (May 14, 2009). Leno's last \`Tonight' guest is Conan O'Brien. Associated Press via The Buffalo News. Retrieved May 14, 2009. Much of O'Brien's entire staff moved cross-country to Los Angeles to prepare his version of The Tonight Show. He and his staff threw themselves into developing the program, but remained concerned regarding NBC's commitment‚Äîor lack of one. Meanwhile, senior level executives at NBC predicted the Leno experiment would flop wildly, getting trumped by hour-long dramas on competing networks and cable. In announcing his 10 pm show on The Tonight Show, Leno said, \\"People are asking me, 'What are you going to do after the last show? Are you going to go on vacation?' This kind of stuff. Actually, I'm going to a secluded spot where no one can find me: NBC primetime. As most of you know, we're not really leaving. We're coming back at 10 o'clock in September. It's a gamble. It's a gamble. I'm betting everything that NBC will still be around in 3 months! That is not a given!\\"Late Night, February 28, 1994 Ratings=The Tonight Show and The Jay Leno Show debut The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien pulled in over nine million viewers to its June 1, 2009, premiere, doing extremely well in the coveted young demographics. Critics were generally very favorable; Tom Shales of The Washington Post, once a Conan detractor, wrote that \\"There's every indication that O'Brien will be up to the job of his illustrious predecessors.\\" Older audiences, however, gradually checked out of the program night by night; seven episodes later, the Late Show with David Letterman had edged above O'Brien for the first time. While Zucker called O'Brien to reiterate that the generational change was expected, other executives were not as pleased. O'Brien and his team were not happy with the lack of promotion in the show's early weeks. Against the wishes of several PR executives, Zucker authorized a press release proclaiming O'Brien \\"the New King of Late Night\\", a move that attracted ridicule. Zucker later regretted the decision, and many at O'Brien's Tonight Show offices were displeased. Over the following weeks, Zucker grew weary with O'Brien's performance and what he regarded as a booking of the wrong stars. When a controversy erupted over a joke Letterman told regarding politician Sarah Palin's family, Zucker eagerly pushed the O'Brien camp to bring her on their show, eyeing an opportunity to regain viewers and perhaps make it a turning point for a show not doing particularly well. O'Brien disliked the idea, finding it pandering to viewers that would alienate fans and the press, as well as hurt his relationship with Letterman. \\"This reaction drove Zucker nuts\\", wrote Bill Carter in The War for Late Night. \\"As a producer, he knew how to manipulate audiences‚Äîthat was simply what you did as part of the job. [ ... ] As a boss, he couldn't believe Conan would stand in the way of what was obviously the smart business move‚Äîfor him and his network.\\" Meanwhile, Letterman continued to score higher ratings than O'Brien with regularity; his fall interview with President Barack Obama topped The Tonight Show by over 2.6 million viewers, and the next week, a scandal involving attempted extortion and personal affairs made him the talk of the country. By August, The Tonight Show was still losing to Letterman in total viewers, but, owing to O'Brien's appeal to a young audience, maintained its lead in the touted demographics. Meanwhile, Leno was candid regarding his plans for his new show: \\"Even though it's ten o'clock, we're going to pretend it's eleven thirty.\\" The Jay Leno Show premiered on September 14, 2009, featuring Jerry Seinfeld and Kanye West (just following his infamous rant against Taylor Swift at the MTV Video Music Awards) as guests. The program racked up 18.4 million viewers, doing much better than O'Brien's Tonight Show debut in both overall numbers and young demographics. Some critics were harsh to Leno's program, with many viewing it as a rehash of the show he had just left. Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times called a commercial funnier than the show's whole, saying, \\"This is the future of television? This wasn't even a good rendition of television past.\\" By the show's second week, with it airing directly opposite season premieres, The Jay Leno Show saw its audience size fall to six million viewers.TVbytheNumbers article: \\"How did NBC do at 10pm Weekdays Before The Jay Leno Show?.\\" Retrieved November 4, 2009. As the weeks wore on, producer Vickers noticed that NBC's plan‚Äîto save the best segments, such as Leno's signature \\"Headlines\\", for last in order to provide a strong lead-in for local news‚Äîwas possibly hurting the program. One month in, Leno often only made third place, and executives became more uneasy. Slipping numbers Ratings for NBC affiliates' local news broadcasts at 11 began to slip by mid-October, especially on NBC owned-and-operated stations in the largest markets, creating high anxiety for the network. The Tonight Show still retained a slightly higher share of the coveted 18‚Äì24 demographic against Letterman, but saw those numbers slip even more when The Jay Leno Show began. Affiliates began to complain, and in addition to a domino effect on the local news, O'Brien, and Late Night with Jimmy Fallon (O'Brien's successor at 12:30), the disastrous ratings for Leno had damaged NBC's existing primetime lineups. This cascading effect caused by the lowered 10 pm lead-in was so significant that local news viewership fell an average of twenty-five percent nationwide, with the decline in some markets being as high as fifty percent. By November, two months after the debut of The Jay Leno Show, ratings for The Tonight Show were brought down \\"roughly two million viewers a night year-to-year\\" from when Leno hosted the program. Clearing the 10 pm time period for Leno also damaged relations with the producers of shows that previously occupied that slot, such as Law & Order: SVU Dick Wolf. Leno offered an October 29 interview to Broadcasting & Cable, which included a notable exchange on the possibility of ever returning to the 11:35 slot: \\"If it were offered to me, would I take it? If that's what they wanted to do, sure. That would be fine if they wanted to.\\" Industry trades were abuzz over the 11:35 comment, and when Conan sidekick Andy Richter called the move less than \\"classy\\" in a chat with TV Squad, Leno called Ludwin to complain. As most programs went into repeats in December, the staff at Leno, notably Vickers, had focused on grabbing big-name guests for that month in an effort to save the show; these efforts were cut short when she was informed they had \\"until the end of November\\". Affiliate calls came at an alarming rate, and research analysis revealed O'Brien's drastically reduced median age for The Tonight Show‚Äîage 56 to 46‚Äîcould possibly reflect that he was too \\"niche\\" for the earlier time. Any effort to take Leno off the air was halted by his contract, which had an enormously unusual catch in that Leno had signed a \\"pay-and-play\\" contract (as opposed to the usual \\"pay-or-play\\") guaranteeing NBC would both air his program and pay him for up to two years. On November 6, NBC chairman Jeff Gaspin received an email from the sales division with a suggestion to cancel O'Brien and reinstate Leno as host of The Tonight Show. Upon Gaspin's legal interpretation of Leno's contract, the option to simply move Leno back to The Tonight Show became relevant. When very poor ratings came in for the November \\"sweeps\\" period, affiliates became persistent and board members demanded something be done regarding the 10 pm lead-in. If something were not done by January, the affiliates reasoned, they would instate syndicated programming or move up their news broadcasts and pre- empt Leno. Desperate for a decision, Ludwin, Gaspin, and Zucker kicked around possible solutions for their dilemma, such as cutting Leno to a few nights per week. In an attempt to alleviate the situation, Vickers moved the most popular comedy segments to the second act of The Jay Leno Show, moving their \\"10 at 10\\" segment to later in the broadcast. Gaspin again received the suggestion to put Leno back at 11:35, and soon began working on a plan to cut The Jay Leno Show to a half-hour, leading into Conan's Tonight Show around midnight. From their perspective, the biggest casualty in this scenario would be Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, which would get bumped to 1 am. The reconfigured lineup could start in March 2010, following NBC's coverage of the Winter Olympics. Zucker preferred a plan for Leno to include an occasional guest and comedy piece, while Dick Ebersol favored returning to the way it once was, with Leno at 11:35 and O'Brien at 12:35. Gaspin laid out his plan to Zucker one week before Christmas, but both agreed to wait it out for the new year, as to not \\"ruin anybody's holiday season\\". Conflict=Proposed changes The plan moved forward after confirmation that O'Brien's contract did not guarantee a strict 11:35 PM start time (a loophole included primarily to accommodate sports pre-emptions and specials such as the network's New Year coverage).Carter, Bill. (October 20, 2009) The Unsocial Network  Culture. Vanity Fair. Retrieved on December 17, 2010. Gaspin planned to disclose the news to Leno first, and then, if all went well, inform O'Brien next week. When Gaspin laid out the proposal to Leno and Vickers, the response was positive, even though they questioned how such a plan would work. Gaspin reasoned that the company was in a desperate situation, and he indicated his confidence that O'Brien would go along with the changes too. While Leno embraced the plan, Vickers was unnerved; without a guest or music act, she might have no studio audience, which could have disastrous consequences for Leno. In order to meet with O'Brien the following Monday, Gaspin was forced to cancel a meeting with the affiliate board, but promised them that by doing so, he would have an answer to the 10 pm problem that would \\"likely be something [they'd be] happy with\\". After his January 6 show, O'Brien met with manager Gavin Polone, and lamented his anxiety with the ratings: \\"I just think [Leno] is going to hurt me in some way.\\" News regarding Leno leaked to FTV Live by the following morning, which set the Internet abuzz with rumors regarding both Leno's and O'Brien's fates. Gaspin scheduled an immediate meeting with Ross and O'Brien as soon as they arrived and explained the proposed changes. \\"I know how hard I worked for this\\", responded O'Brien. \\"It was promised to me. I had a shitty lead-in.\\" Following the tense 15-minute meeting, O'Brien and Ross returned to the Tonight studio. TMZ reported on the story with a headline reading, \\"NBC Shakeup; Jay Leno Comes Out on Top.\\" O'Brien called an emergency staff meeting and assured all that they had not been canceled and all would be fine. The TMZ story deeply bothered O'Brien (\\"the timing of the leak to TMZ‚Äîcoming so soon after a story that Jay had been canceled‚Äîscreamed of an attempt at diversionary action\\"), and he and Ross reasoned that they indeed were the last to be told of the changes. By the following morning, both men determined that they would have to leave NBC, and O'Brien opened that night's show with \\"We've got a great show for you tonight‚ÄîI have no idea when it will air, but it's gonna be a great show.\\" Polone viewed the move as a reactionary one by Zucker, concluding that he was acting in self-preservation, since NBCUniversal owner General Electric (GE) was in the process of negotiating the sale of a controlling interest in the company to cable operator Comcast. When a story ran that night on The New York Times website that Fox had an \\"overt interest\\" in O'Brien and was not going along with the plan, Zucker reasoned that Polone was to blame. The situation became heated when Zucker placed a call to O'Brien's agent, Rick Rosen, inquiring on the story and demanding an immediate answer from the O'Brien camp. Gaspin spoke on the situation at a previously scheduled press conference that Sunday, noting that \\"I obviously couldn't satisfy either with 100 percent of what they wanted. That's why I came up with this compromise.\\" Zucker, upon hearing that O'Brien still did not take the proposal well, threatened Rosen, saying \\"I'm going to tell you right now that I can pay him or play him. I can ice you guys.\\" On the following Monday's show, O'Brien continued jokes on the subject; responding to thunderous applause, he joked, \\"You keep that up, and this monologue won't start until 12:05.\\" \\"People of Earth\\" Rosen suggested they hire \\"perhaps the best known (and most feared) litigation lawyer in Hollywood\\", Patty Glaser, to help grasp the situation. Following discussions on Leno's contract during a post- show conference, Glaser turned her attention to O'Brien for his opinion. He expressed his desire to write a statement expressing his feelings on the matter, and after hearing what he would possibly say in such a statement, Glaser agreed to the idea, although Ross was initially reluctant. O'Brien went without sleep that night, crafting his statement obsessively. He returned to the studio the following morning, listening as the lawyers and Glaser read over the statement (it remained largely unchanged before publication). According to The War for Late Night, Glaser found \\"the statement as ideal for their purposes. It laid out Conan's point of view unequivocally, but without compromising his legal options. Nothing in there overtly said he was quitting, so he could not be accused of forsaking his contractual obligations.\\" O'Brien's press release went out mid-day on January 12, which he addressed to \\"People of Earth\\": > For 60 years the Tonight Show has aired immediately following the late local > news. I sincerely believe that delaying the Tonight Show into the next day > to accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider > to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting.

This wasn't just Conan saying no; it was Conan saying no, and you're wrong, and, by the way, go fuck yourselves.\\" However, the moment that \\"represented the point of no return\\" came that Wednesday night, as a \\"clearly liberated\\" O'Brien joked in his monologue that \\"I'm trying very hard to stay positive here, and I want to tell you something. This is honest. Hosting The Tonight Show has been the fulfillment of a lifelong dream for me. And I just want to say to the kids out there watching: You can do anything you want in life. Yeah, yeah‚Äîunless Jay Leno wants to do it, too.\\" Following the joke, Leno called Gaspin, asking, \\"Why the fuck am I giving up a half hour for this guy?\\" Conversations changed to focus on what O'Brien would require to resolve the matter, and parties began to discuss a settlement. Reaction and media coverage=Public support for O'Brien The \\"I'm With CoCo\\" poster was widely circulated online and at rallies during the conflict. Public reaction was overwhelmingly in favor of O'Brien during the conflict. In the days following the switch announcement, 88% of related Twitter posts expressed support for O'Brien.Mashable article: \\"Conan Wins the Hearts and Minds of the Internet\\". Over one million people joined the two most prominent Facebook groups supporting O'Brien: \\"Team Conan\\" and \\"I'm With CoCo\\" (referring to an on-air nickname applied to O'Brien during his Tonight Show reign). Artist Mike Mitchell designed a poster reminiscent of the Obama \\"Hope\\" poster, showing O'Brien superimposed with an American flag in the background and the caption \\"I'm With Coco\\". The poster was widely circulated and displayed online and at various rallies. The color orange also became the choice of color for O'Brien fans, referencing his light orange hair.Elephant Journal article: \\"I‚Äôm with Coco. The Poster. The Facebook Page. Viva la Grassroots.\\" O'Brien's overnight ratings began to shoot up (much to NBC's chagrin), and the viral support for O'Brien only increased by the week of his final shows. Rallies in support of O'Brien were organized outside NBC studios across the United States, notably in Los Angeles, Chicago, Seattle, and New York City. O'Brien briefly appeared at a January 18 rally outside the Tonight Show studio, after which he gave the crowd free pizza.LAist article: \\"Photos: Rally for Conan Draws Hundreds, Conan Arrives with Free Pizza .\\" The show's announcer Andy Richter and drummer Max Weinberg also made an appearance during the rally to speak to the crowd from atop the Tonight Show studio, and Tonight Show Band trombonist Richie \\"La Bamba\\" Rosenberg was driven around the crowd in a Popemobile-style vehicle. American Red Cross representatives were at a number of the rallies to collect money for the Haiti earthquake relief.Seattle Post-Intelligencer article: \\"Seattle Conan fans to rally at Westlake Center\\".Inquisitr article: \\"Team Conan rallies in protest 'for Coco'.\\" Many in Hollywood expressed support for O'Brien, including Roger Ebert,Twitter post by Roger Ebert: \\"I agree: A touching statement from Conan.\\" Sarah Silverman,Access Hollywood article: \\"Sarah Silverman Declares She‚Äôs ‚ÄòLiterally‚Äô Team Conan, Offers Advice To Leno\\".

Meyers went on to sarcastically point out that if they did end up moving The Tonight Show, it would mean Late Night would end and host Jimmy Fallon would likely end up coming back to Update (and presumably reclaim his job from Meyers). Numerous media outlets offered support of O'Brien, such as Gawker and The Examiner, as well as less usual outlets such as advertisements running on Adult Swim. Numerous parody videos appeared on sites like YouTube and Funny or Die in favor of O'Brien. Criticism of Leno Long-time late night rival David Letterman (formerly of NBC's Late Night with David Letterman, which followed The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson and later host of The Late Show) was critical of Leno and supportive of his former mentee O'Brien. Leno faced heated criticism and increasing negative publicity for his perceived role in the timeslot conflict, with some critics predicting that his reputation‚Äîalong with those of Jeff Zucker and NBC as a whole‚Äîhad been permanently damaged by the incident.Kansas City Star article: \\"Jay Leno is Mr. Nice Guy no more ‚Äî but was he ever?\\". Critics pointed to the 2004 Tonight Show clip wherein Leno claimed he would allow O'Brien to take over without incident.Digital Journal article: Jay Leno in 2004: \\"In '09, Conan, it's yours\\" Actor and comedian Patton Oswalt was among the first celebrities to openly voice disappointment with Leno, saying, \\"Comedians who don't like Jay Leno now, and I'm one of them, we're not like, 'Jay Leno sucks;' it's that we're so hurt and disappointed that one of the best comedians of our generation‚Ä¶ willfully has shut the switch off.\\"Huffington Post article: \\"Patton Oswalt: Jay Leno Is Like Nixon, I Don't Like Him\\". Rosie O'Donnell was among O'Brien's most vocal and vehement supporters, calling Leno a \\"bully\\" and his actions \\"classless and kind of career-defining\\".New York Magazine article: \\"Rosie O‚ÄôDonnell Has More to Say About Jay Leno.\\" Howard Stern was a harsh critic of Leno before and after the timeslot change announcement;\\"Rosie O'Donnell Slams Jay Leno (Part 1 of 2)\\"; YouTube; January 14, 2010 Stern had previously appeared on Late Night in 2006, and told O'Brien that he felt it was unlikely that Leno would ever willingly give up Tonight to anyone.\\"Howard Stern to Conan in 2006: 'I don't see this guy leaving\\" Talk Show News; January 15, 2010 The 67th Golden Globe Awards, which aired on NBC during the heat of O'Brien's settlement negotiations on January 17, featured numerous jokes on the controversy by Tina Fey and Tom Hanks, as well as show host Ricky Gervais who quipped \\"Let's get on with it before NBC replaces me with Jay Leno.\\" Additional criticism stemmed from the fact that the circumstances O'Brien found himself in recalled a similar dilemma that faced Leno toward the end of 1992. Only months into his hosting job on The Tonight Show, NBC considered reversing their decision to choose Leno over Letterman. Leno was aghast and angry that NBC refused to exhibit clear commitment to him as the franchise's new host, and expressed this disappointment publicly. He also made explicit that he would leave the network if he was asked to move back an hour to accommodate Letterman, saying \\"I'm not going to do some little happy hour from Omaha at 12:30.\\" Commentators also faulted Leno for what they perceived as a disingenuous attempt on the host's part to forge an \\"everyman\\" persona in the way he carried himself throughout the controversy. During the episode of The Jay Leno Show that aired after it was made public that Leno had been offered the 11:35 time slot back, Leno portrayed himself as an ingenuous employee merely following NBC's instructions, making a point of stating \\"I don't have a manager, I don't have an agent\\" and referring to his preference of making direct, \\"handshake\\" deals. Despite his claim of having no representation, Leno retained an agent (Steve Levine of International Creative Management), a publicist, and entertainment lawyers. Comedian Bill Burr found that Leno's ambition to take back The Tonight Show was less objectionable than his \\"passive-aggressive\\" behavior and the \\"powerless\\" public image Leno put forth instead of \\"owning up\\" to his maneuverings. Burr argued that NBC \\"never gave [Conan] The Tonight Show\\" in terms of network support, saying, \\"When Jay got The Tonight Show, he didn't have to follow Johnny [Carson] bombing for an hour. [ ... ] Leno struggled for eighteen months before he got going, and he got to go on after a hit show.\\" Comedian Jeff Garlin accused NBC of being \\"cheap\\", suggesting that the network tempted O'Brien with his dream job of hosting The Tonight Show because they did not want him to go to a competitor, but neither did they want to match what the competitors were offering. Garlin accused Leno of undermining O'Brien's incipient Tonight Show by taking the 10 pm slot. Garlin stated that while Leno had been nice to him over the years, the host displayed \\"no character\\" by taking the timeslot back. Garlin vowed never to appear on Leno's Tonight Show thereafter. In an essay for The Wall Street Journal, Nathan Rabin wrote that Leno had \\"raced past the reviled likes of Dane Cook and Carlos Mencia on the list of popular stand-ups hated by comedians and comedy writers.\\" Bill Zehme, the co-author of Leno's autobiography Leading with My Chin, told the Los Angeles Times, \\"The thing Leno should do is walk, period. He's got everything to lose in terms of public popularity by going back. People will look at him differently. He'll be viewed as the bad guy.\\" Joe Queenan from The Wall Street Journal went further in his criticism of Leno, jokingly comparing the controversy to Adolf Hitler's annexation of Czechoslovakia. David Letterman was one of the more adamant critics of NBC and Leno's handling of the conflict. He noted that, \\"We went through our own version of this, 17, 18 years ago\\",Late Show with David Letterman clip: \\"David Letterman ‚Äì Will Jay Leno Do The Right Thing?\\". and he ridiculed Leno's recent \\"state of the network address\\", wherein Leno pleaded for viewers not to \\"blame Conan\\", with Letterman noting, \\"In the thousands and thousands of words that have been printed about this mess, who has blamed Conan?\\"\\"Dave responded to Jay's 'Don't Blame Conan'\\" YouTube; January 19, 2010MTV News article: Anderson, Kyle. \\"Conan O'Brien, David Letterman Continue To Hammer NBC And Jay Leno\\" MTV; January 20, 2010 Jon Stewart of Comedy Central's The Daily Show reflected on the controversy, saying, \\"At least we don't have to deal with Jeff Zucker. That guy's like the Cheney of television, shooting shows in the face.\\"Chattanooga Times Free Press article: NBC'S slide from TV's heights to a late-night punch line\\". Stewart also shouted \\"Team Conan\\" as his \\"Moment of Zen\\" at the end of the January 21 episode of The Daily Show. Stephen Colbert of Comedy Central's The Colbert Report asked guest Morgan Freeman to read a list of \\"untrustworthy things\\", one of which paraphrased a statement made by Leno in 2004, \\"Conan: The 11:30 slot? Yours.\\"Colbert Report episode: \\"January 11, 2010.\\" Fellow late-night host Jimmy Kimmel performed an entire show in character as Leno. At ABC, Jimmy Kimmel of Jimmy Kimmel Live! donned a gray wig and fake chin, performing his entire January 12 show in character as Leno. With his bandleader Cleto Escobedo parodying Leno's bandleader Kevin Eubanks, Kimmel started out his monologue with \\"It's good to be here on ABC. Hey, Cleto, you know what ABC stands for? Always Bump Conan.\\" He also referenced the \\"People of Earth\\" letter, noting how O'Brien declined to participate in the \\"destruction\\" of The Tonight Show, commenting as Leno that \\"Fortunately, though, I will! I'll burn it down if I have to!\\" Leno called Kimmel the next morning to discuss the bit, and at the end of the call, Leno suggested Kimmel come over and appear on his show. When his booking department called to confirm his appearance on a \\"10 at 10\\" segment (during which Leno asked 10 questions to a guest appearing remotely via satellite), Kimmel agreed immediately. When he received the questions for his January 14 appearance‚Äîsuch as \\"What's your favorite snack junk food?\\"‚Äîhe realized Leno intended to neutralize the scathing parody and paint the two as friends. Kimmel, however, was upfront with wanting to discuss the fiasco at hand, and during his appearance attempted to steer the questions that way; when asked about his favorite prank, he responded, \\"I think the best prank I ever pulled was, I told a guy once, 'Five years from now I'm going to give you my show.' And then when the five years came, I gave it to him and I took it back, almost instantly.\\" Later in the segment, when Leno asked, \\"Ever order anything off the TV?\\" Kimmel replied, \\"Like when NBC ordered your show off the TV?\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcKpf6k3j5I Following similar remarks to more questions, Kimmel closed the segment with this comment: \\"Listen, Jay. Conan and I have children. All you have to take care of is cars! We have lives to lead here! You've got eight hundred million dollars! For God's sakes, leave our shows alone!\\" Leno never fought back and accepted the bit as comedy (he ascribed it as Kimmel attempting to score some publicity), but producer Vickers was furious. Kimmel discussed the appearance during an interview with Marc Maron for the latter's podcast in 2012. Kimmel stated that he felt O'Brien was not given a proper chance, but that he was also motivated by his own history with Leno. According to Kimmel, Leno had some years prior been in serious discussions with ABC about the possibility of jumping ship from NBC. During this period, Leno initiated a friendship with Kimmel, wanting to ensure that they would be on good terms if the move was made. (Under that scenario, Leno would have taken Kimmel's time slot and become his lead-in.) However, after Leno made the arrangement to remain at NBC, \\"those conversations were gone,\\" according to Kimmel. Realizing that Leno's relationship with him had been artificial, Kimmel felt \\"worked over,\\" reasoning that Leno was using the ABC discussions as a bargaining tactic to try to get his old job back.\\"Episode 249 ‚Äì Jimmy Kimmel\\". WTF with Marc Maron; January 30, 2012 Neutrality of Jimmy Fallon At the time, comedian Jimmy Fallon hosted the slot after The Tonight Show, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. He is pictured here in 2012, two years before receiving the job hosting The Tonight Show. The only late night host who remained neutral was Jimmy Fallon, calling O'Brien and Leno \\"two of my heroes and two of my friends\\".\\"Jimmy Fallon Weighs In On Conan/Leno Drama\\" Huffington Post; January 14, 2010 He later joked that, \\"There's been three hosts of Late Night: David Letterman, Conan O'Brien, and me. And if there's one thing I've learned from Dave and Conan, it's that hosting this show is a one-way ticket to not hosting The Tonight Show.\\" Ironically, Jimmy Fallon was selected to replace the retiring Jay Leno as host of The Tonight Show in February 2014.\\"Jimmy Fallon To Take Over 'The Tonight Show' From Jay Leno In Spring 2014\\". Huffington Post; April 3, 2013 Defense of Leno and criticism of O'Brien The comedians who came out in defense of Leno were far fewer and tended to have a professional or personal relationship with the host. Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Jerry Seinfeld rebuffed the idea that NBC deserved blame and chastised O'Brien for pointing fingers: > \\"What did the network do to him?\\" Seinfeld asked. \\"I don't think anyone's > preventing people from watching Conan. Once they give you the cameras, it's > on you. I can't blame NBC for having to move things around. I hope Conan > stays, I think he's terrific. But there's no rules in show business, there's > no [referees].\\" The irony of Seinfeld's stance was noted by at least one publication, as Seinfeld had itself weathered a rocky beginning thanks to the patience of NBC executive Rick Ludwin, the benefit of a strong lead-in (Cheers), and years to develop its audience as opposed to O'Brien's six months. Jim Norton, who was a frequent contributor to Leno's shows, touched on the controversy repeatedly in interviews and on The Opie & Anthony Show, calling the harsh criticism of Leno \\"amazing\\" and suggesting that Leno declining to walk away after stating otherwise was no worse than O'Brien \\"actually trying to force Jay out by telling the agents, 'If Conan doesn't get The Tonight Show, he's leaving the network.'\\" NBC executives served as Leno's chief defenders, with Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Universal Sports, being particularly aggressive. Calling Leno's detractors \\"chicken-hearted and gutless,\\" he summarized the late night situation as an \\"astounding failure\\" by O'Brien and further characterized O'Brien's and Letterman's barbed jokes about their rival as \\"professional jealousy.\\" Addressing the common point about Conan's weak lead-in hurting his ability to build an audience in a different timeslot, Ebersol dismissed it as a \\"specious argument.\\" In an interview with Marc Maron that summer, O'Brien's longtime sidekick Andy Richter noted the contradiction between Ebersol's comments and the actions of the network. The demonstrable impact of The Jay Leno Show on the ratings of local news across the country was the direct cause of the cancellation of The Jay Leno Show, and gave lie to Ebersol's implication that lead-ins are irrelevant. Leno's Tonight Show, in contrast, had always enjoyed healthy lead-ins courtesy of a strong NBC primetime line- up. Furthermore, the network would have reportedly faced a US$150 million penalty in order to release Leno from his contract, making O'Brien the far less expensive host to get rid of. Leno himself was among O'Brien's harshest critics, calling O'Brien's numbers \\"destructive to the franchise\\" despite O'Brien's success in the advertiser-friendly demographics combined with his significantly smaller salary. Moreover, Leno's assessment of O'Brien's performance less than three months prior had been significantly different: \\"Personally, I think Conan is doing fine. He's beating Dave in the demo, maybe not in the popular one right now because Dave has a lot of other things going that have people watching for whatever reason, so I think that's not really a fair thing. It's a little too early to tell.\\" Settlement=Negotiations Discussions neared completion regarding a financial settlement by January 14, and were expected to be in place following O'Brien's final week of shows‚ÄîJanuary 18‚Äì22‚Äîa concession O'Brien pushed to give his program a proper farewell. Movement on the settlement slowed when run by General Electric (GE) executives, then-owners of NBCUniversal. NBC had several requests, among those that he not bring Howard Stern on the show his final week (which the O'Brien camp found slightly comical), and that they see the show's final week of scripts (which O'Brien never sent). Talks for much of the rest of the week went nowhere, and a Saturday New York Post story ran claiming that O'Brien's staff felt \\"betrayed\\" by his actions. The article claimed that the staff did not understand why O'Brien could not just take the 12:05 slot in order to keep their jobs, and that he was instead controlled by his ego. O'Brien was infuriated by the story‚Äîwhich he assumed to be a direct plant from NBC‚Äîas nearly all of his staff agreed he should walk. He was personally appalled that the network challenged his character, as stressing severance for his employees was enormously important to him (he had paid them out of his own pocket during the writers' strike three years earlier). NBC added more requests, which the O'Brien camp refused as unreasonable, such as the right to pull any of his final shows if the network objected to the content (e.g., a joke about the conflict/NBC). Jeffrey Immelt, GE chairman, questioned why they were paying so much for a performer destined to run to another network. Negotiations continued into O'Brien's final week; he could not confirm on-air it was indeed his final week of shows, which produced difficulty in booking the guests he desired for his final show. On January 19, multiple media outlets reported that O'Brien and NBC were close to signing a deal between US$30 and US$40 million for the host to walk away from the network.Entertainment Weekly article: \\"Report: Conan getting $40 million to walk from NBC\\". Following his January 20 episode, O'Brien remained at the studio until the early morning hours, alongside Ross and the legal counsel, trying to finalize the settlement. O'Brien wandered off, playing his guitar alone and stepping out on the deserted Universal lot at midnight, attempting to make sense of the situation. O'Brien signed the agreement that night, and the next day, its terms were made public. In all, O'Brien received a US$45 million deal to leave NBC. O'Brien received pay for the remaining two years of his contract (amounting to US$33 million), with additional payments to Jeff Ross, Andy Richter, and bandleader Max Weinberg. The severance pay for his staff was above standard GE levels (amounting in all to US$12 million), which O'Brien had stressed. O'Brien paid around 50 stagehands and various crew members at least six weeks severance pay out of his own pocket, as NBC gave those particular staffers nothing in the settlement. The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees said that they were \\"very happy\\" with how O'Brien treated his employees during the conflict. The contract contained a clause prohibiting O'Brien from making negative remarks about NBC for a certain amount of time;ABC News article: \\"Conan's Payback: How Much Did O'Brien's Bugatti Stunt Cost NBC?\\" ‚Äì Page 2.Fairfield Mirror article: \\"Conan O‚ÄôBrien Likely to Sign $40 Million Exit Deal with NBC\\". it did not, however, contain the previously rumored \\"mitigation clause\\", in which NBC would be able to keep some of the severance pay after O'Brien found a new network. It stipulated that he could return to television on another network no earlier than September 1, 2010. Final week Supporters of Conan O'Brien rally outside alt=A gathering crowd where some people wear orange and hold signs that say \\"I'm With Coco\\". The conflict only provided more comedy material for O'Brien's Tonight Show during its final episodes. Among other bits, O'Brien put the show up for sale on Craigslist (\\"Guaranteed to last for up to seven months; designed for 11:35, but can easily be moved!\\"), and then himself; looked back at clips from the show's seven-month tenure that were dubbed \\"Classic Tonight Show Moments\\"; and designed a bit to seem as though he were spending absurd amounts of NBC's money, such as customizing a Bugatti Veyron, playing audio and video clips with expensive rebroadcast rights, and using a purported \\"rare ground sloth\\" to spray Beluga caviar on what was presented as an original Picasso. Because the segments aired in days immediately following the 2010 Haiti earthquake while national fundraising efforts (including some spearheaded by NBC) were ongoing, O'Brien received criticism for wasting resources. In response to the outcry over the expense of these sketches, O'Brien explained that the segments were indeed jokes, and many of the props were either counterfeits or borrowed in exchange for promotional consideration. The guest roster for O'Brien's final show on January 22‚ÄîTom Hanks, Steve Carell and original first guest Will Ferrell‚Äîwas regarded by O'Brien as a \\"dream lineup\\"; in addition, Neil Young performed his song \\"Long May You Run\\" and, as the show closed, was joined by Beck, Ferrell (dressed as Ronnie Van Zant), Billy Gibbons, Ben Harper, O'Brien, Viveca Paulin, and The Tonight Show Band to perform the Lynyrd Skynyrd song \\"Free Bird\\". In his final moments on air, O'Brien stated that between Saturday Night Live, Late Night and The Tonight Show, he had worked for NBC for over 20 years, and he was \\"enormously proud of the work they have done together\\"; he then thanked NBC for the first time since announcing his intention to quit. O'Brien said his decision to quit as host was \\"the hardest thing [he] ever had to do\\".\\" 'Conan Says Goodbye: A Thank-You to NBC and 'Free Bird' \\",thewrap.com, Jan. 22, 2010 He praised and gave thanks to his staff, and thanked his fans (specifically those who participated in the Los Angeles rally during periods of heavy rain) for their overwhelming support. He ended the show by offering heartfelt advice to his viewers in his farewell address, stating: > All I ask of you is one thing ... I ask this particularly of the young > people who watch. Please don't be cynical. I hate cynicism. For the record, > it's my least favorite quality and it doesn't lead anywhere. Nobody in life > gets exactly what they thought they were going to get.

Following the taping, the studio set was used one final time for a party thrown by staff. O'Brien's monologue spot from the floor was framed and signed by his staff as a gift, which touched O'Brien. 10.3 million people watched the final episode of The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien, a notably high number for live late-night viewing and on a Friday night. The final episode scored a 7.0 household rating and a 4.4 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demo.Gorman, Bill. \\"Conan O‚ÄôBrien Dominates Ratings In Final (Live) Tonight Show Week\\", TVByTheNumbers.com, January 28, 2010 Not only did O'Brien's final show beat all late night competition, it outscored all prime time shows in the 18‚Äì49 demo from that night and the night before.Seidman, Robert. \\"Conan Saves His Best Ratings For Last Tonight Show\\" ,TVByTheNumbers.com, January 23, 2010 The network confirmed that Leno would officially resume as host of The Tonight Show on March 1,ABC News article: \\"Conan's Payback: How Much Did O'Brien's Bugatti Stunt Cost NBC?\\" ‚Äì Page 1. and reruns from O'Brien's time as host aired until NBC began airing the Olympics on February 15.TMZ article: \\"NBC Gives Conan O'Brien the Reruns\\". Leno's first Tonight Show back pulled in 6.6 million viewers, and his margin over Letterman again held for much of the rest of his run until his second Tonight Show departure in 2014.

According to NBC, if O'Brien continued hosting, it would have been the first year that The Tonight Show would have actually lost money, which Leno later contended was damaging to the franchise. This assertion was scorned by skeptical critics as it was calculated that Conan's Tonight Show would have made significantly more money in advertising than Leno's show did, due to his more favorable youth demographic numbers. Also Leno's larger staff, higher production costs, and higher salary would have by all accounts made Leno's Tonight Show more costly.Adalian, Josef.

O'Brien and Ross also challenged this accusation, concluding that in order for NBC to use such figures, they must have folded in the cost of erecting the new studio/offices, alongside startup costs. At NBC, most young employees tended to support O'Brien and joined the \\"I'm with Coco\\" Facebook groups; NBC later asked all employees to rescind their membership in any O'Brien-supporting pages. Similar action came when any effort to mention O'Brien's tenure was whitewashed from company history.Gather.com article: \\"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien Never Existed. \\" Gaspin was happy with the settlement, but nevertheless agreed with one of O'Brien's points‚Äîthat his show had no time to grow: \\"Could it have grown? Absolutely ... We just couldn't give him the time.\\" Zucker, in an interview with Charlie Rose, defended his strategy but noted that both shows were a mistake. Zucker, who had known O'Brien since their days at Harvard and was very close friends with Ross, was very disappointed with how events played out, although he viewed it as necessary. Leno, in an attempt to repair his public perception, granted an interview to Oprah Winfrey on January 25; he stripped himself of any blame for O'Brien's disappointment, noting that it was all about ratings, and also confirmed that he told a \\"white lie\\" in 2004 when he guaranteed The Tonight Show to O'Brien. In a reference to a 2007 Super Bowl commercial starring Letterman and Winfrey (the two had feuded for years prior), Letterman, Leno, and Winfrey all appeared in a spot airing during Super Bowl XLIV in February 2010. The ad‚ÄîLetterman's idea‚Äîwas the first time the late-night hosts had met since their own 1992 debacle. In it, Letterman and Leno sit on opposite sides of Winfrey watching the game; Letterman deems it \\"the worst Super Bowl party ever\\" due to Leno's inclusion, and Winfrey tells him to \\"be nice\\", resulting in Leno quipping \\"Oh, he's just saying that 'cause I'm here.\\" The clip stirred a frenzy, with commentators speculating that Leno had been \\"green-screened\\" into the picture. Letterman had initially wanted O'Brien to be in the promo as well, but O'Brien firmly rejected it, saying \\"No fucking way I'm doing that. It's not a joke to me‚Äîit's real.\\" O'Brien was sure his agreement prohibited television appearances for several months, but gathered NBC would be only too happy to allow him a one-time reprieve for the ad, as it was to improve Leno's image. O'Brien, by this point, was planning a live tour with his staff that would take him on the road, and had also created a Twitter account.Lyons, Margaret. \\"Conan O'Brien's Twitter debut\\" Entertainment Weekly; February 25, 2010 After about one hour online, O'Brien's number of Twitter followers had rocketed past the 30,000 followers of the official Jay Leno account,Matyszczyk, Chris. \\"Conan joins Twitter, beats Leno in hours\\" Cnet; February 24, 2010 and he held over 300,000 followers in under 24 hours; he surpassed the one million mark in May 2010. Many speculated that O'Brien would sign a deal with Fox for a late-night program; Comedy Central and HBO had also expressed interest in O'Brien.Business Insider article: \\"Why Is USA Network, NBC's Sister Station, Wooing Conan?\\".Conan O'Brien Mulls Post The Tonight Show Options. MovieWeb.com (January 22, 2010). Retrieved on December 17, 2010. Fox's deal moved slowly and they eventually withdrew their offer due to station resistance, the daunting financial investment, and opposition from Roger Ailes. O'Brien eventually signed with cable network TBS in April, with his next program, Conan, set to debut in November. The move prompted industry surprise; online blog Vulture commented that \\"Conan will now be featured as a lead-in for Lopez Tonight on TBS. It's not just basic cable, it's unsexy basic cable.\\" His nationwide comedy tour, The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour, began on April 12 and ran through June 14. A documentary shot during that time, Conan O'Brien Can't Stop, as well as a May 60 Minutes interview, prompted some observers to deem him \\"whiny\\". Vanity Fair James Wolcott said O'Brien \\"came off as a peevish straw of nervous energy ... a self-involved chatterbox.\\" As NBC could have potentially retained intellectual property originating from O'Brien's entire 17-year tenure with the network,The Hollywood Reporter article: \\"NBC to keep Coco's masturbating bear.\\"The Hollywood Reporter article: \\"O'Brien's NBC departure leaves bits behind\\". O'Brien simply changed names on the tour (turning his character, the Masturbating Bear, into the \\"Self-Pleasuring Panda\\"). The Washington Post later reported that retaining the characters was \\"not a key issue for O'Brien\\". Aftermath Conan premiered in November 2010 to 4 million viewers, leading all late-night talk shows and more than tripling the audience of its direct competition, The Daily Show and The Colbert Report on Comedy Central. However, ratings quickly fell; by the following fall, The Wall Street Journal proclaimed that \\"TBS's pricey Conan O'Brien experiment is flopping.\\" In an effort to bolster ratings, TBS secured the cable syndication rights to The Big Bang Theory at a reported US$4 million per episode to serve as a lead-in to Conan three nights a week. Steve Koonin of Turner Entertainment stated in 2012 that \\"Conan is our Mount Rushmore. We've made him the centerpiece of TBS. If success were only about ratings, we'd just run Westerns all the time.\\" The Hollywood Reporter credited it with forging \\"a digital empire, his company's own shows and a young audience TBS hopes will follow him anywhere.\\" The show is currently renewed through 2022,. Variety. Retrieved May 17, 2017. which will bring O'Brien to his twenty-ninth year as a late night host. He is currently the longest-running active late night host, and among all late night hosts only Johnny Carson (thirty years) and David Letterman (thirty-three years) have had longer tenures. Many of the executives involved in the botched transition subsequently left NBC. Zucker was fired by Comcast Executive Vice President Steve Burke, but stressed that Comcast's insistence to install their own team was the reason. Marc Graboff opted to leave his contract early that November, as did Gaspin. While O'Brien admitted in 2012 that he occasionally still felt resentment over the events that transpired, he noted that \\"I had an amazing partnership with NBC and was very disappointed at the outcome, but I didn't feel entitled to Late Night or Tonight or to the TBS show. If you're in this business and haven't experienced profound pain at some point, you're not doing it right. I strongly believe that.\\" He has had no contact with Leno, noting \\"the odds are we will both leave this Earth without speaking to each other, which is fine. There's really nothing to say. We both know the deal. He knows; I know. I'd rather just forget.\\" In a 2010 issue of TV Guide, the timeslot conflict ranked #1 on a list of TV's biggest \\"blunders\\".Battaglio, Stephen. \\"The Blunder Years\\", TV Guide, November 1, 2010, Pages 20‚Äì21 A wax likeness of O'Brien that had been commissioned by NBC/Universal from Madame Tussauds and unveiled during a December 2009 episode of The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien was quietly returned to the Madame Tussauds museum on Hollywood Boulevard; the figure had originally been intended to permanently reside in the \\"NBC Universal Experience\\" theme park attraction. A remote segment produced a few months into O'Brien's TBS show saw the host humorously reuniting with the wax statue. On October 5, 2011, O'Brien returned to 30 Rockefeller Plaza for a surprise, scripted appearance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon to ceremonially retrieve the Triumph the Insult Comic Dog puppet from the studio after NBC had finally granted him the rights to use the character on TBS's Conan. During the two-and-a-half minute bit, O'Brien and Fallon joked about the controversy when Fallon said, \\"You were [host of Late Night] for sixteen years. Then what happened?\\" to which O'Brien laughed and said, \\"Don't you worry about that. You're a young guy.\\" When interviewed by Marc Maron in 2011, O'Brien remarked, \\"I'm trying to avoid that thing where you get a story in your head that's very clean. I think there are too many people that come up with a very simple story where they're the hero, and they don't learn anything.\\"\\"Episode 163 ‚Äì Conan O'Brien\\". WTF with Marc Maron; April 3, 2011 During his 2012 appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman, O'Brien made it clear that he held no animosity toward NBC, pointing out that the individual executives he clashed with had departed the network shortly after he did due to a regime change.\\"Conan O'Brien on Letterman\\". YouTube; May 17, 2012 Indeed, Conan has occasionally shown clips from his NBC shows on his current TBS program with NBC's permission, and the character of Triumph the Insult Comic Dog (owned by NBC) was eventually allowed to appear on the TBS show as well, with Triumph's performer Robert Smigel explaining that NBC only stands to gain by allowing him to give their property exposure.\\"Robert Smigel AMA\\". Reddit; March 7, 2015 In an interview on Piers Morgan Live, also in 2012, O'Brien acknowledged that in retrospect the plan to architect a transition for The Tonight Show five years in advance was \\"absurd,\\" though he noted that he never anticipated Leno's ratings would fall in that interim, as the press had sometimes intimated, and he pointed out that all previous Tonight Show hosts had departed when they were on top in the ratings. He further remarked that he was happier in his current situation at TBS where he feels \\"liberated\\" and can do the material he wants without the baggage of upholding a legacy.\\"Conan on Piers Morgan Live\\". YouTube; June 25, 2012 In 2013, O'Brien was the headline performer invited to give remarks at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, and The Tonight Show controversy was humorously alluded to throughout the evening. During his own speech, President Obama quipped, \\"I understand that when the Correspondents' Association was considering Conan for this gig, they were faced with that age-old dilemma: Do you offer it to him now, or wait for five years and then give it to Jimmy Fallon?\\"\\"President Obama at 2013 White House Correspondents' Dinner (C-SPAN)\\".

YouTube; April 27, 2013 The ceremony had also opened with a pre- recorded sketch that featured Kevin Spacey as his House of Cards character Frank Underwood, who at one point expresses sympathy toward O'Brien for \\"that backstabbing Leno.\\"\\"'Frank Underwood' to Obama: 'Welcome to Nerd Prom'  ABC News Exclusive  ABC News\\". YouTube; April 28, 2013 Later that year, O'Brien was chosen to host Carson on TCM, a series that re-aired classic interviews from The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. In 2014, Leno participated in a 60 Minutes episode focused on the host's second and permanent departure from The Tonight Show desk. Leno expressed to Steve Kroft that he had been \\"blindsided\\" in 2004 when NBC executives asked him to relinquish The Tonight Show in five years' time, though he admitted that he had accepted the decision with no argument or inquiry. In spite of this and the public remarks Leno had made at the time blessing O'Brien's succession, both Leno and his wife Mavis characterized The Tonight Show as having been taken from the incumbent host, rather than being something that he had voluntarily surrendered. When Leno explained that he was more willing to step aside the second time due to the considerable talent of Fallon and because \\"talented people will only wait so long before they get other opportunities,\\" Kroft pointed out that Leno had said very similar things about O'Brien years before. \\"Well, maybe I did, yeah,\\" admitted Leno before joking, \\"Well, we'll see what happens.\\" During a 2015 interview with Howard Stern, O'Brien explained that he prefers to avoid talking about the \\"craziness,\\" stating that people in show business shouldn't complain, that \\"no one cares\\", and that he noticed addressing the topic even in joking response to an earnest question by a guest on his show invariably resulted in admonishments from the media to \\"let it go.\\" He claimed that even in hindsight he does not regret doing five more years of Late Night instead of moving to FOX, nor does he regret his incarnation of The Tonight Show.\\"Conan O'Brien: Like You've Never Heard Him Before\\". Howard Stern; February 26, 2015 Leno kept The Tonight Show number one for the rest of his run, until he handed the franchise to Fallon in February 2014. Fallon's credibility with younger viewers and presence online was why NBC instituted the change, which was announced only three years following O'Brien's departure. During the show that aired the day of the announcement, Conan congratulated Fallon, stating, \\"Jimmy is the perfect guy to do it, and he's gonna do a fantastic job.\\" While alluding to (and joking about) the 2010 controversy many times over his last few weeks on the air, Leno did not directly acknowledge his nine-month absence from the franchise nor did he mention O'Brien when he delivered his thank-yous and goodbyes as he concluded his second tenure as host. During the February 6, 2014, episode of Conan, however, which aired the same night as Leno's final Tonight Show, O'Brien referenced Leno in his monologue by alluding to NBC's position as the American broadcaster of the 2014 Winter Olympics, saying: > NBC has the Olympics. It's a big deal. NBC will finally get to show somebody > who is okay with passing the torch. (pause for laughter and applause) I > allowed myself one, but it was a good one. Though NBC had made a considerable effort to scrub any references to O'Brien's brief tenure as The Tonight Show host both on-air and online, with one former blogger for NBC Sports noting a corporate policy banning any mention of O'Brien, it was acknowledged by the network during the buildup to the 2014 transition from Leno to Fallon. A brief shot of O'Brien walking onto his Tonight set was displayed in an on-air promo chronicling the franchise's history, and Fallon referenced the conflict on his first Tonight Show episode, when he opened the show by joking: > I'm Jimmy Fallon, and I'll be your host‚Äîfor now. (pause for laughter) Of > course, I wouldn't be here tonight if it weren't for the previous Tonight > Show hosts, so I want to say thank you to Steve Allen, Jack Paar, Johnny > Carson, Jay Leno, Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno. Less than a month removed from hosting Tonight, Leno appeared on The Arsenio Hall Show on February 26, 2014, as a surprise guest to deliver the news that the revived program had been renewed by CBS Television Distribution for a second season. This proved to be premature, however, as Hall's program was indeed canceled on May 30, 2014. Comedian Bill Maher paid tribute to Leno when he was inducted into the TV Academy, an honor bestowed upon the host in 2014 when he stepped down from The Tonight Show a second time. A longtime friend of Leno, Maher complained that Leno was \\"victimized\\" by the press during the NBC fiasco. In a 2015 interview Leno reiterated his stance that O'Brien's own performance led to his ouster from 11:35 and that he remained mystified by the suggestion that he should have refused the time slot when it was offered back to him, saying \\"Why? Because Conan and I were good friends? No. At that point ... it's a business decision. I'm sure it could have been handled differently. But I think it was a matter of letting things take its course. If Conan's ratings would have been fine, it wouldn't have been an issue. It wouldn't have come up.\\"\\"Q&A;: Jay Leno‚Äôs real talk on comedy, Conan and One Direction\\". The Globe and Mail; April 24, 2015 In 2017, Leno again absolved himself, instead emphasizing that he kept The Tonight Show number one after his return. He addressed the longstanding claim that his contract was the more expensive one to break with equivocation: \\"I mean, if I'm that smart, how did I lose the show in the first place?\\" When he took over Tonight, Fallon insisted that Leno is welcome to appear on the show anytime he wishes, saying \\"whenever he wants, he's got a stage.\\" Leno made his first appearance as a guest on November 7, 2014, although he had previously appeared in a produced House of Cards parody on August 12, 2014, in which he is revealed as the mystery man who pushes Fallon (as Frank Underwood) onto the tracks in front of a speeding subway train. Leno has subsequently appeared on Tonight several times in the years since. On February 13, 2015, Robert Smigel appeared in character as Triumph the Insult Comic Dog on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon to promote The Jack and Triumph Show. During the interview, he joked about the conflict to a visibly nervous Fallon: \\"Listen, we love NBC. NBC‚Ä¶ we kid, you know? NBC will always be the place where Jack and I got our start. And where they fucked Conan.\\"\\"Jack McBrayer Struggles to Talk over Triumph's Quiet Reading\\". YouTube; February 13th, 2015 On December 7, 2015, The Daily Show made reference to the controversy. When former host Jon Stewart made a guest appearance on the show, current host Trevor Noah jokingly remarked \\"Are you here to take the show back? Oh, man, I heard about this in American TV. Are you taking the show back?\\". Stewart replied, quietly, \\"Trust me, a thousand times no\\". Over time, as the controversy has become more distant, formal acknowledgement of O'Brien's lengthy career at NBC has become more common by the network. In 2017, mention was made of the host in NBC's 90th Anniversary Special, and a display for him (along with all other former Tonight Show hosts) appears in the ride queue of the Race Through New York Starring Jimmy Fallon theme park attraction at Universal Studios Florida. A plaque on the O'Brien display reads: > In September 1993, Conan O'Brien made his television debut on Late Night > with Conan O'Brien after working as a writer on such television comedy > institutions as Saturday Night Live and The Simpsons. O'Brien's brand of > irreverent humor proved to be a hit with the late night audience, including > memorable sketches like \\"If They Mated,\\" \\"In the Year 2000,\\" and \\"Triumph > the Insult Comic Dog.\\" In September 2004, on the 50th anniversary of The > Tonight Show, NBC announced that O'Brien would take over hosting duties from > Jay Leno in 2009.

In conjunction with his 25th anniversary as a late-night host, it was announced that O'Brien, TBS and NBC had come to an arrangement that would allow the entirety of O'Brien's late night archive (with the exception of musical performances, which posed insurmountable licensing issues), totaling over four thousand episodes, to become available in January 2019 via a state- of-the-art web site dubbed \\"Conan 25\\".

In 1908, more of these same kind of artifacts were discovered at a site near Vinƒça, outside of the city of Belgrade, Serbia. Scholars subsequently labeled this the \\"Vinƒça Script\\" or \\"Vinƒça-Tordos Script\\". The Vinƒça symbols were also discussed by Marija Gimbutas, who in the 1950s developed her theories that became collectively known as the Old European culture. Gimbutas claimed that these symbols represented an Old European Script that she said was a writing system that predated the Sumerian Cuneiform script. This theory reinforced her claims that the Neolithic civilizations of southeastern Europe were matriarchal, Mother Goddess worshippers, since the symbols were so often found on clay anthropomorphic female fetish figurines that are to be found in archaeological sites throughout the entire region. Her claims have largely been disproven by subsequent research and discoveries,Winn, Shan M. Pre-writing in Southeastern Europe: The Sign System of the Vinƒça Culture ca. 4000 BCE. Calgary: Western Publishers, 1981, p. 15. Further clouding the issue, there have been several people who have published theories about the Vinƒça symbols, including one that claims it is the ancient Etruscan alphabet; all of these theories have been disproven by scholars. The Vinƒça symbols were found etched or painted on the ubiquitous anthropomorphic female clay statues. These statues have markings on them that appear in roughly the same location (for instance, along the upper arms and shoulders), and are found in various archaeological sites scattered over a wide geographical area. Beginning in 1875 up to the present, archaeologists have found more than a thousand Neolithic era clay artifacts that have examples of symbols similar to the Vinƒça symbols scattered widely throughout south-eastern Europe. These include: *The TƒÉrtƒÉria Tablets, discovered in 1961 in the village of TƒÉrtƒÉria, SƒÉli≈ütea, Alba County, Romania. *The Gradeshnitsa Tablets, discovered in 1969 in Gradeshnitsa, Vratsa Province, Bulgaria. *The Dispilio Tablet, discovered in 1994 in Dispilio, Kastoria regional unit, Greece. *The Cucuteni-Trypillia pintadera (or barter tokens) There has been some controversy in the dating of some of these discoveries, especially the TƒÉrtƒÉria Tablets. File:Tartaria amulet retouched.PNGOne of the three TƒÉrtƒÉria tablets, dated 5300 BC File:Gradeshnitsa front.jpgOne of the Gradeshnitsa Tablets File:CucuteniTokens.JPGCucuteni-Trypillian barter tokens, or pintadera In 1981 archaeologists unearthed a remarkable discovery dating back to 4200 BC from the Precucuteni site of Poduri-Dealul, near the town of Ghindaru, BacƒÉu County, Romania. Dubbed the \\"Council of Goddesses\\", it was a collection of 15 anthropomorphic female clay figurines, all of whom were seated, with 13 of them seated on accompanying clay chairs (or thrones), all of the figurines were placed so that they were facing inward in a circle (see photograph below). The archaeologists noted that some of these figurines had symbolic markings painted in red on their shoulders, almost identical to other clay female figurines found elsewhere. *Looking below, the figure to the left has a symbol made of four lines that are connected to a perpendicular line (or bar) located on the right shoulder. Another female figurine found at a Precucuteni site near T√¢rgu Frumos, in Ia≈üi County, Romania, has an identical symbol, including the placement of it on the figurine's right shoulder. T√¢rgu Frumos is located a linear 88.5 km. (55 miles) from Ghindaru. *The figurine on the right has a symbol of three lines connected to a bar and placed on the left shoulder, again identical to other Precucuteni female clay figurines found at sites near the villages of Isaiia, Ia≈üi County, Romania, and Sabatynivka, Ulianovskyi Raion, Kirovohrad Oblast, Ukraine. Isaiia is located 119 km. (74 miles), and Sabatynivka is from Ghindaru. Both examples illustrated of these symbols, the three and four lines connected to a bar, are found in other archaeological artifacts from across the region, and are emblema Thus it appears that the Vinƒça or Vinƒça-Tordos symbols are not restricted to just the region around Belgrade, which is where the Vinƒça culture existed, but that they spread across most of southeastern Europe, and was used throughout the geographical region of the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture. This \\"Goddess Council\\" example is just one of many that supports the widespread use of these symbols among the Neolithic people of this entire area, and presents very compelling evidence to suggest that these symbols were understood by many individuals who lived in different areas, which lends support to the notion that they were indeed examples of proto-writing, if not a rudimentary writing system.

Wilder (born August 1, 1964) is an American football coach who most recently served as the head coach of the Old Dominion Monarchs football team. He was only the second coach all-time in the program's history and the first since football's rebirth at the school in the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) in 2009. Old Dominion played football for eleven seasons when the university was a two-year institution known as the Norfolk Division of the College of William and Mary. Between 1930 and 1940, the team compiled a record of 42-36-4. The program was then discontinued due to a rule banning freshman players and a US$10,000 debt. Hired in 2007, Wilder spent the first two years recruiting and starting up the program. In 2009, in his first competitive season as head coach, the Monarchs finished 9‚Äì2. That was the best winning record ever for a first-year program in college football's modern era. The Monarchs were outscored by a total of only eight points in their two losses. Wilder's inaugural team finished the year ranked in the top ten in five FCS statistical categories, including second in sacks allowed, third in scoring offense, turnover margin and net punting. The 2009 Monarchs were ninth in rushing offense. ODU was fifth in FCS attendance in 2009, selling out all of their home games in the 19,782-seat Foreman Field.Radford, Rich; \\"College Football 2010  ODU game-by-game preview\\"; hamptonroads.com In his first three years, Wilder led Old Dominion to a 26‚Äì7 record. In 2011, in the Monarchs first season in the Colonial Athletic Association, they earned a berth in the 2011 FCS playoffs, hosting crosstown rival Norfolk State. Also in 2011, after playing 27 games in its \\"modern era\\", ODU received its first Top 25 ranking on October 3, coming in at No. 21 in The Sports Network poll. The Monarchs were ranked among the Top Ten after competing in 33 games. Biography Wilder grew up in Madison, Maine and attended Madison Area Memorial High School, where he graduated in 1982. A highly recruited quarterback, Wilder opted to play his college ball close to home. Upon graduation from the University of Maine in 1987 with a degree in physical education, Wilder served as a graduate assistant coach for two seasons under Jack Bicknell at Boston College, where he earned his master's degree in educational administration in 1990. He then returned to Maine, where he was an assistant coach, assistant head coach and finally associate head coach from 1990 to 2006. He and his wife Pam have two sons, Derek and Drew.

The series was created by Gerard Johnstone, Jaquie Brown and Hayley Cunningham and premiered 25 July 2008 on TV3. The US cable television channel Logo began broadcasting the series' episodes to date 12 June 2010.\\"She‚Äôs almost famous\\" ‚Äì Boston.com ‚Äì 12 June 2010 Themes The show highlights the unglamorous reality of being a celebrity in New Zealand. It depicts fame as a game that can never be won. Jaquie's character is far from perfect. She's insecure, petulant and selfish, which makes her ultimately more human and relatable as a result. Development Jaquie Brown and writer/director Gerard Johnstone first worked together on New Zealand music channel C4. In 2005 Brown left the station to become the quirky news reporter on Campbell Live. After hearing Jaquie's anxieties about her career, the pitfalls of being a minor celebrity, and being recognised by her gynaecologist, Johnstone came up with the idea of Brown playing herself in a sitcom which would parody voice-over narrated female skewed television shows such as 'Sex and the City' and 'Desperate Housewives'. Production The Jaquie Brown Diaries was produced independently through Brown & Johnstone's own company, Young, Gifted & Brown. Jaquie Brown had never acted professionally or received any acting training. It was also the professional debut of writer/director/editor Gerard Johnstone. Many episodes of the series were co-written with Jodie Molloy, an ex-TV3 publicist. Hayley Cunningham produced the first series. The second series was produced by Matt McPhail. Acclaim The show debuted to unanimously positive reviews. It was dubbed 'A miracle' by The Listener for the fact that it was a NZ sitcom 'that doesn't suck', an observation which drew on NZ's troubled past when it comes to narrative comedy. The first series won best comedy at the Qantas Film and Television Awards , was the top NZ show in The Herald's 'Best on the Box' for 2008, and was declared best local comedy or TV show in several publications such as The Listener, Metro magazine and Jaquie Brown was voted one of the New Zealanders of the year in both the NZ Herald and North and South magazine. The second series was declared 'Best TV show on TV' by Steve Braunias in Sunday magazine. In June 2010 it debuted in the US on MTV Logo. The Boston Globe's Matthew Gilbert called it 'delightfully cringeworthy' and said that it put other major network sitcoms to shame. Both seasons won New Zealand's Qantas TV and Film Award for best comedy programme in 2009 and 2010. Series Summary=Series 1 The first series was loosely based around many aspects of Brown's life, having just left music station C4, now working as the light- relief on a hard-hitting current affairs show, feeling a little in over her head in the world of journalism and having to deal with the pitfalls of being a C-grade celebrity. With the help of a young network publicist, Kim Sharee, Jaquie attempts to claw her way up the media ladder, but her efforts are thwarted by the arrival of a new reporter, Serita Singh, whose journalistic style is strikingly similar to Jaquie's and seems to be stealing her thunder at an alarming rate. Over the course of the series, Jaquie's humanity takes a back seat to her ambition. In the episode finale, she frames Serita by attaining her computer log-in and sending a pornographic e-mail entitled 'A guy, a girl and a mug (Based on the infamous '2 girls 1 cup')' to Ian. Serita is fired, and Jaquie becomes Ian's new temporary replacement while Ian and Elena do a feature in Iraq. Jaquie is in over her head to begin with, as she bumbles her way through an interview with the Prime Minister, but she manages to regain her footing in the last segment by making a high school principal partake in a pop quiz with a dyslexic student. Although Jaquie finds herself on the receiving end of the fame and adoration she has always wanted, her conscience, and her useless yet perceptive flatmate Tom get the better of her, and she confesses to her sins. The closing scene sees her leaving TV3 but hopeful for a brighter future. Series 2 AKA The Jaquie Brown Odyssey The second series premiered on 25 October 2009. It is much darker in tone than the first series, and attempts a slightly more complex narrative structure as well as a more significant story arc. It also spends more time on the supporting characters, particularly Jaquie's publicist Kim Sharee and her flatmate Tom. The series aired in NZ as 'The Jaquie Brown Diaries series two' as the network were concerned a title change would confuse audiences, but the producers released the DVD under the original working title 'The Jaquie Brown Odyssey'. Jaquie begins the second series as a washed up alcoholic, whoring her celebrity for 'The Carpet Warehouse'. Kim Sharee offers her a chance to get back into the network's good books by taking a slot on one of its umbrella radio stations 'Radio Hautaki' with James Coleman. Jaquie and James hate each other's guts but Jaquie has no alternatives, and despite James's protests, the station manager Derek thinks it's a great idea. This pairing continues the show's art imitating life theme, as Coleman and Brown were forced to work together on Coleman's short-lived breakfast show on Channel Z. Brown quit the show due to irreconcilable differences. They later buried the hatchet and Brown, Coleman and Johnstone would end up working together on C4. Serita Singh continues to be a thorn in Jaquie's side. She has gone on to become the darling of the network, has a top ten covers album and even has her own sitcom coming out which is dreadful even though it's a hit with audiences and critics alike (A self-deprecating stab at the show's own success). Jaquie soon forgets her honourable reasons for getting back into broadcasting and is even more determined than ever before to outshine Serita. Eventually she achieves this goal when she goes on a celebrity reality show called 'Celebrity Frontiers' where celebrities must live as they did in early settler times. Audiences fall for Jaquie's petulant antics and she is set to win the game. But when she gets the celebrities lost in the bush, they inadvertently stumble into a Maori militant training camp and are kidnapped and held hostage. The ordeal gets nationwide news coverage and when Jaquie rescues the hostages, she ends up becoming more famous than ever. But the old Jaquie creeps back when she signs up with a new agent, despite the fact that Kim Sharee has quit her job to take care of Jaquie full-time. The two have a falling-out. Tom attempts to console Kim Sharee by offering her the chance to represent him and his aspirations to resurrect the sword and sorcery franchise with his script & screen test for 'Deathslayer 5'. Meanwhile, Jaquie's agent turns out to be a shark who negotiates such a high salary for Jaquie at the radio station that they have to fire James Coleman to afford it. Kim Sharee turns Tom's screen test for 'Deathslayer 5' into a YouTube phenomenon and Jaquie realises what a monumental mistake she's made by taking her for granted. She calls on Kim Sharee for help to get her out of her contract and she reluctantly agrees. But Jaquie is unable to enjoy her new celebrity status largely due to the fact that Tom is usurping it with his internet stardom. She decides to Google herself and discovers a backlash. But when she responds to it, she's ridiculed on TV3's breakfast show 'Sunrise' and accosts the show's host Oliver Driver in a fish market and beats him down with a Hapuka. As a result, she loses her nomination as Metro Aucklander of the year. Tom takes her place and strikes up a romance with Serita. Meanwhile, the story about Jaquie trying to get Serita fired has been leaked. The next day it's all over the papers and Jaquie fears it's the end of her career. Kim promises she can fix it, but when Jaquie sees Tom with Serita, she loses the plot. She kicks Tom out of the flat and resents Kim for not telling her about it. In her depression she turns again to drink and drugs and goes on a 'celebrity booze binge of epic proportions'. Kim & Tom put her in rehab where she bumps into her old boss Ian McHuntly who is being treated for sex addiction (McHuntly was caught engaging in homosexual acts in a public toilet and publicly shamed at the beginning of the series just after he had offered Jaquie her old job back). He tells Jaquie he's not a sex addict, he was set up, but feels safer in rehab than he did on the outside. While Jaquie is in rehab being treated for her irrational resentment towards Serita, Kim discovers that there is indeed something more sinister about the nation's favourite female presenter. After they mistakenly swap BlackBerrys, Kim takes a phone call that was intended for Serita from Randall, an ex-TV3 network executive, now TVNZ in-house producer, and learns that Serita is pitching a show to a rival network. Meanwhile, Tom has turned into an arrogant fame hungry monster with delusions of making it big in America. Kim warns him that they only own the web rights for Deathslayer, and if he makes a public appearance he'll be sued. Tom refuses to listen to Kim, and when Kim shows up at Serita's house to give her phone back, she overhears Serita manipulating Tom and smiting Kim's intentions. As Kim listens, she's set upon by Serita's guard dog Barry and manages to escape inside the backdoor just as Serita is walking Tom to his cab. Kim hides in Serita's attic, and sees a disturbing wall of magazine cut outs, self-affirmations, news articles and mutilated pictures of Jaquie. At the centre is Jaquie and Tom's own show prop 'Do celebrities have talent', which they had unsuccessfully pitched to Randall earlier in the series. Just as Jaquie has made a breakthrough in rehab and no longer feels any animosity towards her enemy, Kim calls and tells her that Serita framed Ian so that she could get out of her McHuntly at 7 contract and that Serita is planning to pitch Jaquie's show to TVNZ in one hour. Jaquie escapes rehab and tries to stop Serita, but when she follows Serita into a darkly lit studio inside TVNZ, the lights come up on a partially built set for a show called 'Celebrity Talent Quest' and she realises she's too late. Serita reveals her dark side to Jaquie for the first time and Jaquie puts the pieces of her dastardly puzzle together. Serita admits to everything, and says there's nothing she can do about it, at which point Jaquie pulls out a dictaphone which has been recording the whole time. But before Jaquie can finish gloating Serita takes it from her and snaps the tape in half. But just as Serita is about to leave Jaquie in defeat, Jaquie offers up an alternative. Instead of hosting the show, Jaquie proposes that they go head to head as contestants in the 'broadcasting battle of the century'. Serita accepts Jaquie's offer and they shake on it, at which point Serita assures Jaquie ominously that she always gets her way. The series concludes at this moment with the banner 'To be continued'. Future The show's creators have stated that they never intended to make a third series, but would like to conclude the series in a final chapter, the format of which is yet to be confirmed. Cast and characters=Main characters *Jaquie Brown :Jaquie Brown is an insecure and misguided TV reporter with an addiction to fame. She is prepared to do whatever it takes to increase her celebrity status, even if it means making some morally reprehensible decisions in the process. *Serita Singh :Serita Singh (Madeleine Sami) is smart, resourceful and annoyingly beautiful, Singh threatens to destroy everything that Jaquie has not worked very hard for. *Tom :Tom (Ryan Lampp) is Brown's freeloading flatmate who is pursuing a hopeless career as a stand-up comedian / actor / writer. While he might share Jaquie's lazy work ethic, he has a stronger moral code. Tom tries to remind Jaquie that there are more important things in life than status. *Kim Sharee :Kim Sharee (Hannah Banks) is Jaquie's conniving network publicist. Like Jaquie, Kim Sharee is also a woman who puts her career before everything else. A great PR agent in the making, there is no task too difficult when it comes to getting the best for her stable of network show ponies. *Ian McHuntly (Only a guest in series 2) :Ian McHuntly (Jonathan Brugh) is the host of McHuntly at 7. A consummate professional in the world of broadcasting with charm and charisma that requires several power naps a day to reboot. Off camera Ian also has a shocking vocabulary and a keen eye for the ladies. *Elena (Series 1 only) :Elena (Geeling Ng) is the controlling producer of McHuntly at Seven. Elena rules with an iron fist and chooses to be feared rather than loved. *James Coleman (Series 2 only) :James has been forced to share his midday radio show with Jaquie to 'soften the edges a bit'. Like Jaquie, James Coleman is an ex-TV presenter with a lot of talent but not a lot of luck. He's even more bitter and volatile than Jaquie is but despite their similarities they hate each other with a passion, although they do occasionally bond over a mutual disdain for the intern, Nannette. *Nannette (Series 2 only) :Nannette (Florence Noble ) is a sweet but very mousey intern at the radio station who tries her hardest to please James and Jaquie. She desperately wants to make a career for herself in radio but she lacks spark and confidence, or as Jaquie less tactfully puts it, is 'a lighter shade of beige'. Guest characters *Terence Ben'et (Rhys Darby) :An incredibly handsome and charming NZ actor who has achieved acclaim in Hollywood and also happens to be Tom's older brother. *Randall (Jeff Szusterman) :The network executive at TV3, turned in-house producer at TVNZ. Loosely based on Jaquie's real life ex-boss Andrew Szusterman and played by his brother Jeff. Randall is rude, arrogant and difficult to have a conversation with. *Brendo & Brooksy (Brendhan Lovegrove and Geoff Houtman) :Based on a concoction of irritating morning radio DJs, Brendo & Brooksy form the breakfast team 'The Morning monkeys' on Radio Hautaki. Celebrity cameos *Vanilla Ice (Deleted scene on DVD) *Rhys Darby *Matt Costa *Helen Clark / The Prime Minister of New Zealand *Mark Sainsbury *Shavaughn Ruakere *Rodney Hide *Jo Cotton *Petra Bagust *Dave Gibson *Carly Binding *Mike Puru *Phil Bostwick *Antony Starr *Anika Moa *Jon Bridges *Jackie Clarke *Bill Ralston *Brooke Howard-Smith *Claire Chitham *Joel Tobeck *Awen Guttenbiel *Rikki Morris *Helena McAlpine *John Cocks (Cocksy) *Oliver Driver *Carly Flynn *Rod Cheeseman *Kate Hawkesby *Karl Burnett Music A significant factor in the show's popularity is its use of popular music, something which is largely uncommon in NZ dramas due to high licensing costs.

He resigned due to the Iranian government's violent crackdown on protesters in the 2009‚Äì2010 Iranian election protests. Mohammed-Reza Heydari is also the first Iranian diplomat to resign in protest against the regime's violence against the people. Life=Career and education He has a Masters of International Politics from Institute for Political & International Studies, Tehran (IPIS) and served the Iranian diplomatic service for 20 years. He had a 5-year mission in Georgia, 3 years in Germany and from 2007 to January 2010 in Norway. His previous posts included: Senior Expert at the Bureau of the Main Consular Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Iranian Consul in Georgia; Senior Expert at the National Organization for Civil Registration; Iranian Consul in Frankfurt, Germany; Senior Expert at the Passport and Visa Office bureaus of Tehran‚Äôs international airports ; Iranian Consul in Oslo, Norway. Resignation Heydari quit on 7 January 2010 saying that his act is in opposition to Iran's latest Internal issues. He tried to convince other Iranian diplomats to join him in resigning their posts but remained alone as reported. Iran's Foreign Minister Manuchehr Mottaki confirmed his resignation but said that the government had not accepted it. In January after his resignation, he said he had requested political asylum in Norway, where he and his family were living. On February 17, 2010, Norwegian immigration authorities granted Heydari and his family asylum. In his interviews with BBC, Mr. Heydari mentioned that he has been a supporter of Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Iran‚Äôs Green Movement. Demonstrators in Iran refer to Mr. Heydari in their slogans as Iran‚Äôs ‚ÄòGreen Ambassador‚Äô. CNN interview As Iran marked the 31st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, a high-ranking Iranian defector warned that the national unity of Iran could be threatened if the government steps up its campaign of violence against opposition groups. \\"If they (Iranian officials) move in the direction of violence, they will not be able to control the system and we might move in the direction in which Iran's unity then might be compromised all together,\\" Mohammed Reza Heydari, Iran's former down graded staff in consular section of Iranian Embassy in Oslo, Norway, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. He said that he hopes the strikes, civil disobedience, and non-violent protests in his homeland will \\"break the back\\" of the government and force it to listen to what the people say. \\"The cause (of) bringing the message, bringing different groups together, is starting a referendum to have free elections in Iran so all these groups can stand together and bring about a democratic government to meet the demands of all religious and ethnic minorities as well,\\" he said. Heydari told Amanpour that the divisions in Iran are reflected in his country's embassy in Oslo. \\"There's chaos ... The diplomatic corps and the intelligence corps are split at our embassies right now,\\" he said. Green Embassy Campaign After his resignation, Mr. Heydari founded the ‚ÄòGreen Embassy Campaign‚Äô. Green Embassy Campaign is a non governmental organization (NGO). Mohammad Reza Heydari persuaded the other Iranian diplomats and the members of staff at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tehran to join this campaign and instead of being representatives of a ‚Äòcoup d'etat government‚Äô as he calls it, become, in his opinion, the ambassadors of their right-seeking nation.

The episode was written by Michele Fazekas, Tara Butters, and Tracy Bellomo, and directed by Terrence O'Hara. It aired in the United States on Fox on January 15, 2010. This episode immediately follows \\"Getting Closer\\". As such the group head to Tucson, where the Rossum Headquarters is, to take down the mainframe. Plot The episode starts in a flashback set two years ago. Caroline is in the Rossum office, as Boyd explains to her that he knows she is special because they have tested her blood. He coerces her to join the Dollhouse, under the pretense that if she doesn't comply she will go to prison or be given the death sentence. Boyd assures her he will keep her safe. In the present, Anthony and Priya arrive back at the Dollhouse. Neither of them can live with themselves for not helping fight this war. However, as they enter the Dollhouse, they see that the war has already begun and move on to investigate. At an unknown location, Ballard destroys his phone and tells DeWitt they should be safe, at least for now, and that they have to move and cannot wait any longer. However, DeWitt disagrees and they continue to wait for the others to arrive. Ballard checks to see how Mellie is doing after he cut out her tracking device. Mellie attempts to kiss Ballard, but he pulls back as Mellie tries to remember she is just a doll. A vehicle arrives and it turns out it is Boyd, Topher, and Echo. However Echo is bewildered and incoherent. Boyd manages to sedate her as the group tries to figure out what has happened. Ballard suggests re-evaluating the plan, but Boyd disagrees as they need to take down the mainframe. Ballard says Echo was the only one who could recognise the head of Rossum and in her current state she cannot help. He wonders how they will get inside, but DeWitt says they will simply walk in through the front door as they have something Rossum wants. Inside the Dollhouse, Anthony and Priya make their way to the security office to try to get the surveillance footage. However all the hard drives have been taken, so they decide to leave. However, as they pass the imprinting chair, Priya notices a note on top of an inserted wedge saying \\"Press Enter.\\" After a brief debate, Anthony gets into the chair and is imprinted with Topher 2.0 (\\"The Left Hand\\"). Priya asks Topher 2.0 what has transpired, but he is as confused as Priya. The group arrives at Rossum Headquarters and walk straight through the front door as planned. Clyde 2.0 is there to greet them, but he is now in the body of Dr. Saunders/Whiskey. Clyde 2.0 says that this world is for people who can evolve. DeWitt wonders if it includes her and the group. Back inside the Dollhouse, Topher 2.0 begins to rant about how he would like his body back. Priya is able to calm Topher 2.0 by saying that his original is most likely alive since otherwise there wouldn't be another person to leave the wedge and the note behind. Topher 2.0 wonders why his original left the wedge behind. When Priya mentions the security footage was taken, Topher 2.0 realizes his purpose. He reveals he installed his own camera in the office and plays back the footage, exposing the detail that Boyd had injected Echo with something as she was being imprinted. They realise that Boyd is working for Rossum. In Clyde 2.0's office, Clyde 2.0 praises DeWitt on how she raised Echo to be what she is today. Clyde 2.0 says that Echo is a savior for a select few and that DeWitt is considered one of them. DeWitt explains that Echo is no use to Rossum given her current condition, but Clyde 2.0 rebuffs by explaining they only want the body. Locked in a room, Ballard, Mellie, Topher and Boyd try to figure out what is going on. Boyd feigns trying to break the lock, when Topher looks away, he simply uses a key card. Boyd takes Topher with him explaining that they are going after Echo and that Ballard and Mellie would be responsible for taking down the mainframe. Inside the Dollhouse, Topher 2.0 rants about Boyd's betrayal. Priya attempts to track down Mellie through her tracking device, but it is deactivated. Priya says they need to go and help but Topher 2.0 isn't sure what they can do. Topher 2.0 says he will sacrifice himself and give Anthony back his body, then give him additional abilities, including combat and computer skills. As Boyd and Topher make their way around Rossum Headquarters, Topher explains that somebody inside the Dollhouse must have betrayed them. He has recognised that Echo's symptoms were similar to when Priya was drugged by Nolan (\\"Belonging\\"). Boyd seems concerned, but moves on to take out a guard. Inside the Dollhouse, Anthony's persona has been restored. With his upgrades, he takes out Rossum agents before he and Priya decide to leave for Tucson. In Rossum Headquarters, Echo finally comes to her senses and realises it is Boyd who has betrayed them. Topher and Boyd continue to walk around before finally stumbling upon a lab. Topher recognises his tech which DeWitt had given up to Mr. Harding. Boyd tries to use one of them, but it is non-functioning. Topher sees that Rossum is weaponizing the tech and attempts to destroy it. However Boyd convinces Topher that if he fixes one unit, they can use it and not have to kill anyone else. Topher agrees and gets to work. Meanwhile, Ballard and Mellie have made their way to a weapons cache. Mellie tries to understand why Ballard cares about her, given she is only a program. However Ballard says he has become one as well and that it doesn't matter to him anymore. Topher realizes he can fix the tech with a simple fix. No sooner has he explained it to Boyd when Boyd reveals his duplicity. Suddenly, Echo jumps in and beats Boyd to the floor. However, she is stopped by Clyde 2.0 after he threatens to kill DeWitt. Topher cannot believe what is going on. Boyd explains that he cares about the group and that is why he brought them here. It is not revealed whether he was actually going to kill Topher or not. Mellie and Ballard arrive at the cooling unit for the mainframe. They decide to destroy the cooling unit, overheating and destroying the servers. Boyd notes the conviction that Topher and DeWitt have. He had wanted them all with him as his \\"family\\", except Ballard, whom he dislikes. DeWitt says she would rather be dead than keep Boyd's company. Boyd observes that death would be a blessing, as once Rossum executes their plan it will be likely they will be imprinted and enslaved. He explains that the technology is out there and it cannot be un-invented, and that Echo is their saviour because whenever she blocks an imprint, it leaves chemical markers in her spinal fluid. They are going to farm it and use it on themselves so they can become immune to imprinting. Boyd then knocks Echo out with a disruptor. Mellie and Ballard are able to destroy the cooling system, but the alarms go off. Boyd threatens to kill DeWitt if she doesn't activate Mellie's sleeper protocol (\\"Man on the Street\\"). When DeWitt calls the bluff, Boyd uses a recording of her activation code and Mellie almost kills Ballard. When Mellie regains control for a short time, she kills herself instead. Echo has been strapped down and is being prepared to have her spinal fluid tapped. Boyd attempts to use the neural lock and key but Echo rebuffs him. Anthony and Priya arrive and manage to free Echo. Echo orders Anthony and Priya to rescue DeWitt and Topher while she finishes Caroline's job: shutting down the Rossum labs. Priya surrenders herself as a distraction, allowing Anthony to take out the guards and free Topher and DeWitt. Topher says he needs to destroy the tech and the plans, as well as the manufacturing equipment. As Echo tries to look for a way to destroy the labs, she runs into Clyde 2.0. Echo tries to get through to Whiskey or Claire, but she fails and they engage in a brutal fight. Ballard runs into Boyd, and having been separated from the group, does not know what is going on. Boyd tells Ballard that DeWitt turned on them. Echo has just knocked out Clyde 2.0 when Boyd and Ballard arrive. Boyd turns his weapon on Ballard and holds him hostage. Echo is unable to shoot because she fears hitting Ballard. However, she shoots Ballard in the leg to give herself a free shot at Boyd. The plan fails as Boyd rushes down onto Echo and they engage in a fist fight. Boyd gets the better of Echo and is about to kill her, until Topher arrives, uses the remote wipe/imprinting tech on Boyd and turns him into a doll. Echo straps Boyd with explosives and hands him a grenade. She orders him to walk into the mainframe and pull the pin when she leaves the room. Topher is able to get Claire/Clyde 2.0 out while Ballard evacuates the building before leaving himself. Adelle, Topher, Ballard, Anthony, and Priya wait outside when the explosion destroys the labs. Echo makes it out just in time. \\"So, did we save the world?\\" asks Ballard. \\"I guess we did,\\" Echo responds. Ten years later, Echo and Ballard are fighting through the streets of an apocalyptic Los Angeles. Despite their best efforts to stop Rossum, the corporation was ultimately successful in deploying the mind-wiping tech. Reception=Reviews Jevon Phillips from Los Angeles Times said \\"viewers were probably a bit more on edge knowing that Boyd Langton was the puppet master and having to watch him guide the team around.\\" Rachel Reitsleff from iF Magazine said the episode had \\"lots of action, lots of emotion, and lots of exposition in an eventful episode.\\" She did praise the performances of Lennix and Acker in their roles as Boyd and Clyde respectively, citing \\"Lennix is menacing and weirdly sweet as Boyd shows his emotions even while threatening his erstwhile friends, and Acker plays the self-confident Clyde with relish in a bit of plotting that makes great use of the actress.\\" She also notes the speed of the episode saying \\"due to the series‚Äô cancellation, storylines that seem as though they could have sustained a whole season are resolved in an episode, which requires what feel like long monologues from a number of characters.\\" Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a 6.3. He noted that though the previous episodes had given the show much momentum, and in regards to the show's rushed deadline, \\"it's still difficult to not find this episode lacking.\\" Goldman also commented on the inconstancy and the infallibility of Boyd's betrayal, stating how \\"it just didn't add up.\\" This episode was praised in particular for its acting, notably from Harry Lennix (Boyd), and Enver Gjokaj (Anthony), commenting particularly that \\"Enver Gjokaj is a wonderful actor and did an amazing job mimicking Fran Kranz.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:2010 American television episodes Category:Dollhouse (TV series) episodes ","title":"The Hollow Men (Dollhouse)"},{"id":"25825389","title":"Don't Look Back (Fine Young Cannibals song)"},{"id":"25825391","text":"Sujata Keshavan (born 1961) is an Indian graphic designer.

A \\"tongue in jowl\\" tribute to former Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, the song was briefly popular in Canada when it premiered. Diefenbaker, who was often nicknamed \\"The Chief\\", initially expressed his delight at the tribute, but later cooled to the song. Genesis In 1974, Stringband songwriter Bob Bossin was watching the Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier title fight with Bob Rae, who would later become premier of Ontario. After Ali regained his title after a gap of many years by winning the bout, Rae commented that with Ali's victory, other events from the late Fifties and early Sixties could now recur: Floyd Patterson could now defeat Ali, Marilyn Bell could swim Lake Ontario again, and Diefenbaker could again be Prime Minister. Bossin was inspired to write the song. According to Bossin in a CBC interview, the song, which he described as \\"very Canadian\\", is written from the viewpoint of someone with a complex character, and who mixes hope and nostalgia. The song's lyrics look nostalgically back at 1957, when Diefenbaker became Prime Minister, but in the chorus states that when Diefenbaker is Chief again, a dollar will be \\"worth a dollar again\\", an apparent reference to the devaluation of the Canadian dollar which cost Diefenbaker's Progressive Conservatives dearly in the 1962 election. Broadcast and reception The band was broadcast performing the song on the CBC program As It Happens. The CBC was flooded with calls, and the next night, put on a segment about the response which included a phone interview with Diefenbaker, who was at home recovering from illness. The 79-year-old former Prime Minister stated \\"I must say that as a connoisseur of good music I was simply delighted ... It gave me quite a lift to listen to it.\\" (audio) The song received some radio play, especially around Diefenbaker's hometown of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, but did not become a hit. Bossin could find no label willing to publish the song, which was thought to have little interest in the United States. Diefenbaker eventually cooled to the song. When Bossin's mother learned of Diefenbaker's changed attitude, she called her son, \\"Honey, I think he's on to us.\\" In a final interview before his 1979 death, Diefenbaker stated that he had no comment about it. Bossin indicated that he had no idea why The Chief had come to have reservations about the song. The song was included on The Indispensable Stringband 30th anniversary box set.

Early years Behan is \\"of the Kit Fox Clan of the Cheyenne Nation of Oklahoma on her mother‚Äôs side, and on her father‚Äôs side she is half Northern Cheyenne and half Arapahoe of the Rabbit Lodge.\\" She was one of eight children. Her parents were migrant farmworkers.

Margaret felt so confident in her new career as an artist that she resigned from her job in 1982 and took up her new artistic career full-time. Her work is mentioned in four Folk Art books.Six Directions She later moved to Taos, New Mexico due to the properties of the clay there. Addiction work Margaret suffered from alcohol addiction as a young woman. She feels that she drank in order to 'fit in' with her friends. With the aid of addiction clinics, and more of her grandparent's ceremonies, Margaret was able to become free of her addiction. As a result of this experience, Margaret trained to be a Licensed Substance abuse Counselor and with her traditional teachings, has led retreats for children and co-dependants of alcoholicsFuture Primitive to help other First Nation people that had found themselves in a similar position. Historical trauma commonly leads to alcohol, drug, and behaviour issues.Schaefer (2006) p.38 The Cheyenne Elders Council Margaret is the founder of \\"The Cheyenne Elders Council\\", formed in 2007‚Äì2008,NCCS with Behan as the sole member, and has the mission to, \\"Heal Our Own Oppression.\\"Sacred Studies She had moved to the Northern Cheyenne Reservation, where her father was from, and \\"was troubled when she heard one of her people say that Cheyenne youth would have to save themselves,\\" saying \\"They were not getting any kind of influence or teaching from the elders.\\" \\"A project Behan and the Cheyenne Elders Council completed as part of the 11th council is the creation of the T‚Äôsistsistas‚Äôs Sacred School in Behan‚Äôs home.

In 2006, a chapter in the book \\"Grandmother's Council the World\\", features Behan and the Native American Church, founded by her grandparents. This movement, (illegal at the time), allowed the combining of traditional ceremonies which then allowed the First Nation people's to stay connected to their traditional beliefs. In 2012, Behan hosted \\"the 11th Gathering of the International Council of 13 Indigenous Grandmothers ... on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation July 26 to 29,\\" at which the riders commemorating the Northern Cheyenne Exodus of 1878 shared stories of their journey.\\"The Ride Home\\" \\"The gathering ...

Blumenstein began healing at the age of 4. At the age of nine, Blumenstein's great-grandmother gave her thirteen eagle feathers and thirteen stones to give to the International Council of 13 Indigenous Grandmothers. Years later, when the International Council of 13 Indigenous Grandmothers convened for the first time, Blumenstein passed out these precious objects to the rest of the members with tears in her eyes.Schaefer (2006) pp. 48‚Äì49 After Blumenstein started healing people from the age of 4. She \\"worked at many hospitals delivering babies as a doctor's aide in Bethel and Nome\\".

Her teachings about the \\"Talking circle\\" have been published. In 2004, Blumenstein was approached by The Center for Sacred Studies to serve on the International Council of 13 Indigenous Grandmothers. The Council has been active in protecting indigenous rights and medicines, and traditional teachings on wisdom. She was interviewed on her work with the Council by the Women Rising Radio Project in 2011. Personal life Blumenstein was married to her husband, a Jewish man, for 43 years. Five of Blumenstein's 6 children have also died.Schaefer (2006) p. 48 Blumenstein's own health has not always been good and in 1995, she found that she had cancer. Blumenstein saw that being diagnosed with cancer made her realise that she needed to heal herself at a 'deeper' level‚Äîconcluding that the cancer was due to being angry that her father had not been present in her early years. Blumenstein is training her granddaughter to follow in her footsteps in order to be a healer and to know their Yup'ik traditions. Awards and honors * In 2006, both Blumenstein's tribe, the Yup'ik and her mayor declared the 18 February to be Rita Pitka Blumenstein day. * In 2009, Blumenstein was one of fifty women inducted into the inaugural class of the Alaska Women's Hall of Fame.

Both are green coloured secondary minerals found in oxidised zones of copper deposits, often associated with each other. Pseudomalachite is polymorphous with reichenbachite and ludjibaite. It was discovered in 1813. Prior to 1950 it was thought that dihydrite, lunnite, ehlite, tagilite and prasin were separate mineral species, but Berry analysed specimens labelled with these names from several museums, and found that they were in fact pseudomalachite. The old names are no longer recognised by the IMA.Berry L G (1950). American Mineralogist 35: 365 to 385  Type locality  The type locality is the Virneberg Mine, Rheinbreitbach, Westerwald, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. This is an area of ancient copper mining dating back to Roman times, and worked intermittently up until 1872. The type material is held at the Mining Academy, Freiberg, Germany.  Structure  The copper ions are co-ordinated by six oxygen ions to form distorted octahedra.Ghose, Subrata (1963) The Crystal Structure of Pseudomalachite. Acta Crystallographica 16:124-128 These octahedra are linked by sharing edges to form two distinct types of infinite chains, parallel to b. The chains are linked alternately, again by sharing octahedral edges, to form sheets parallel to the bc plane. Distorted phosphate tetrahedra link the sheets, and there is some doubt about the exact position of the hydrogen ions in the structure.Shoemaker, G L, Anderson, J B and Kostiner, E (1977).

Built during, and commissioned shortly after the First World War, she went on to see service in the Second World War, being sunk early in 1942. Thanet had been one of the ships on the China Station on the outbreak of war. After briefly being converted to a minelayer she spent the early years of the war patrolling off Hong Kong. With the Japanese entry to the war Thanet evacuated Hong Kong with another destroyer, just hours after the Japanese began their attack on the city. She made her way to Singapore and briefly deployed there until being sent to intercept an enemy troop convoy, in company with the Australian destroyer . The allied ships ran into a heavy Japanese force, and after a short battle Thanet was sunk and Vampire was forced to withdraw. Construction and commissioning Thanet was ordered from the yards of Hawthorn Leslie & Company, Hebburn in July 1917, part of the 1917-18 Programme. She was laid down there on 13 December 1917 and launched on 5 November 1918, six days before the Armistice with Germany. She was commissioned on 3 August 1919, and was initially used to trial a 'flying off platform' for aircraft. Second World War Thanet was on the China Station, deployed with the Local Destroyer Flotilla at Hong Kong on the outbreak of the Second World War on 3 September 1939. Her initial duties involved carrying out patrols and intercepting German shipping, and in October she was nominated to be converted for use as a minelayer. Work began at the naval dockyard in Hong Kong on 18 October, and she was able to participate in the laying of a defensive minefield in Lantau Channel between 21 and 27 October, the following day reverting to her anti-submarine role. The rest of the year and all of 1940 was spent carrying out similar duties, deploying out of Hong Kong to protect trade and patrol in search of enemy vessels. The threat of the Japanese entry to the war in December 1941 led to negotiations on 6 December between the British commander in the area, Admiral Tom Phillips, and his American counterpart Admiral Thomas C. Hart. Hart agreed to send four destroyers to Singapore, , , and , while Phillips would move Thanet and her sister-ship to Singapore. Events were overtaken by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor the following day, and the Japanese assault on Hong Kong which began on 8 December. Thanet and Scout hurriedly evacuated the port on 8 December, just hours after the attack began, and made their way to Singapore to join the Eastern Fleet. A small force consisting of the destroyer , the gunboat and eight motor torpedo boats remained behind to fight the Japanese. On their arrival at Singapore on 13 December, Thanet and Scout carried out various escort duties. Last battle and sinking On 26 January 1942 Malaya Command received intelligence that a Japanese troop convoy was approaching Endau, and attempted to attack it with nine Lockheed Hudsons of No. 1 and No. 8 Squadrons, and 12 Vickers Vildebeests. The attack went badly, losing five Vildebeests, and being unable to inflict significant damage. The Japanese commander, Vice-Admiral Jisabur≈ç Ozawa had received intelligence reports that two cruisers were at Singapore, and so concentrated his forces off Endau. The two cruisers were in fact Thanet, and the destroyer , and following the failure of the air attacks, Malaya Command ordered them to sea to intercept the convoy. They steamed from Singapore at 4.30pm on 26 January, carrying only three torpedoes each. Early in the morning of 27 January they ran into the covering force of Japanese warships, consisting of three destroyers, and later being joined by the Japanese cruiser Sendai. Thanet was hit in the engine room and disabled, and began to sink. Vampire attempted to lay down a smoke screen but was driven off under heavy fire, and managed to escape. Thanet sank with the loss of 12 men afterwards.Cannon, p. 79 65 crewmen managed to get to the coast and arrived at Singapore, but 31 were picked up by and handed over to Japanese troops the next day. It is believed they were executed in retaliation for heavy Japanese losses sustained in an ambush by the Australian 2/18th Battalion which occurred at the same time as the naval battle off Endau.

The first formal proposal was made by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques during the 10th OIC Summit held in Putrajaya, Malaysia in 1424H (2003G) and supported the following year by the United Arab Emirates at an IDB Board of Governors Meeting in Iran. The ITFC was mandated to streamline and consolidate operations within the IDB that had been carried out through multiple programs under the Bank's Trade Finance and Promotion Department (TFPD). A substantial amount of the trade finance activities was carried out through what was then referred to as the Import Trade Financing Operations Program (ITFO); which was commenced soon after the establishment of IDB, in 1977G, to finance the import financing needs of the member countries. In 1987G, the Export Financing Scheme (EFS) was established to complement the ITFO and help promote exports of the member countries. In 1998, IDB took on management of another trade finance program established in cooperation with the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA), to finance the exports of Arab League member countries to non-Arab League member countries of the African Union. On the other hand, several entities in the IDB Group such as the Islamic Bank's Portfolio for Investment & Development (IBP), the Unit Investment Fund (UIF), the Islamic Corporation for the Development of the Private Sector (ICD) and the Awqaf Properties Investment Fund (APIF) were also engaged in trade finance activities. All intra-trade finance programs operational within the IDB were to be incorporated into the proposed corporation. The creation of the ITFC was approved in Jumada Al-Awal 1426H (June 2005G) by the Board of Governors of the IDB Group at its 30th annual meeting in Malaysia. The corporation's Articles of Agreement were signed the following year in Kuwait. The ITFC became operational on 1st of Muharram, 1429H (January 10, 2008G) and integrated the activities and operations of all the IDB Group's various trade finance programs into its overall operations. The ITFC was formally inaugurated on 29th of Jumada Al-Awal, 1429H (June 3, 2008G) at the IDB's 33rd Annual Board of Governors Meeting held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Advancing trade ITFC advances trade by contributing to the development of markets and trading capacities to help all OIC member countries do business more effectively with each other and the rest of the world. Improving lives The paramount concern of IDB has been to alleviate poverty and foster the economic development and social progress, particularly for its least developed member countries, through economic development and trade. This humanitarian objective has been at the core of ITFC's formation. Examples of actions In July 2012, ITFC signed US$40 million financing agreement with the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan for the imports of gasoline and diesel. Trade finance The ITFC's trade finance arm is responsible for providing Shariah- compliant trade financing for both public and private sector entities in the OIC member countries, with a particular focus on financing OIC intra-trade. The ITFC provides direct financing and also works with other international financial institutions to support OIC trade and intra-trade. As a member of the IDB Group, the ITFC has leverage over government and acts as a facilitator in mobilizing private and public resources to build and develop intra-trade. The ITFC is also able to streamline the trade financing process by issuing an Irrevocable Commitment to Reimburse (ICR) on Letters of Credits (LCs) issued under ITFC approved finance. Trade Cooperation and Promotion Program (TCPP) The Trade Cooperation and Promotion Program is the trade promotion arm within the ITFC that aims to promote and enhance intra-trade and trade cooperation among OIC member countries through four business lines: Trade Promotion, Trade Facilitation, Capacity Building and Development of Strategic Commodities. To this end, the ITFC, through the TCPP, focused on the integration of Trade Promotion Organizations (TPOs) in Islamic countries through skills and knowledge transfer leading to capacity building. By networking TPOs, through ITFC sponsorship of regional and international conferences, intra-trade issues can be addressed and intra-trade development accelerated. TPOs are the best source of information for identifying prospects, obstacles to overcome and solutions to accelerate the development and growth of intra-trade among OIC member countries. Main shareholders The IDB holds majority shares while the remaining is owned by the member countries and the financial institutions. The inclusion of member countries as shareholders is necessary to ensure the international status of ITFC. ITFC headquarters ITFC headquarters is located in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and is planning to expand geographically by opening new branches as deemed necessary. Recipient countries for ITFC Trade Finance All IDB Group OIC member countries are entitled to benefit from ITFC trade finance. The present membership of the Bank stands at fifty-six countries spreading over four continents, Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America. In addition, the ITFC may consider non-member countries as eligible recipients in accordance with rules and terms to be approved by ITFC's Board of Directors. Goods, commodities and services eligible for financing by ITFC ITFC's trade finance operations cover goods, commodities and services, including raw materials, industrial intermediate goods, agricultural inputs, food items and all other goods of commodities eligible under Shariah.

Looney Tunes animated short directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on February 3, 1951, and stars Sylvester. Plot Sylvester's owners, Sam and Violet, go on vacation to California, forgetting to put him outside. Sylvester abruptly notices this, finding that he is locked inside an empty house devoid of food with no milk being delivered for two weeks. He finds a cupboard full of canned tuna and cat food, but discovers that he also needs a can opener. He seemingly cannot find one, until he sees a mouse with it. Sylvester begs for the mouse to give it to him, but he throws it into his hole. Sylvester frantically tries and fails to retrieve it and the mouse saunters away. Sylvester angrily gives chase and crashes into the mouse hole. Sylvester tries vainly to open a can of tuna by beating it against the floor and jumping on it. When this doesn't work he tries to chop it with an axe, but just as he swings, the axe blade flies off the handle and out through the mail slot. The mouse continues to taunt Sylvester and tosses the can opener out into the open, but he ends up crashing into the wall again. Next, Sylvester tries using an unbent metal coat hanger to retrieve the can opener, however the mouse hooks it to a live wire and Sylvester receives an electric shock causing his fur to fry off. Sylvester then sets up to drop a piano on the can, just before the mouse taunts him again with offers for the can opener, prompting Sylvester to release his hold on the rope and dropping on himself. An attempt to cut a larger hole around the mouse's hole is foiled by the mouse cutting a hole beneath Sylvester's feet causing him to fall into the basement. A dynamite attempt predictably backfires after the mouse inflates and pops a paper bag, making Sylvester think the dynamite had already gone off, only to have the explosive go off in his face. His following attempt, involving a vacuum, results in Sylvester being sucked in, along with hot coal from the fireplace, and clumsily tumbling down into the basement while trying to hit the mouse with a golf club. However, the angrily persistent cat returns with an armful of dynamite and fireworks which blows prematurely as he's lighting the fuse, resulting in a tremendous explosion. Regardless, he does finally recover the can opener in the process. Going to the cupboard and cheering \\"I got it!\\" along the way, he finds that the mouse has now locked it and has the key. Sylvester lets out a cry of frustration and faints while the mouse twirls the key.

Life After a period in Jamaica, where he built up an estate (see Sugar plantations in the Caribbean), he retired to Walthamstow in 1685, and built an Independent meeting house there, with Hugh Farmer as the first minister. He became known for strict household arrangements, his doors being closed against visitors at 8 pm. He was spoken of as eccentric in his old age and he had a very public quarrel with Thomas Bradbury. Coward instituted a course of 26 lectures On the most important Doctrines of the Gospel, in the church of Paved Alley, Lime Street; they were published in two volumes in 1730-1 and became known as the \\"Lime Street Lectures\\". A total of nine preachers took part, among them Abraham Taylor and John Gill.Available online in an 1844 edition. The other preachers were Thomas Bradbury, Robert Bragge, Peter Goodwin, Thomas Hall, John Hurrion, John Sladen and Samuel Wilson. (This was not the first lecture series Coward had sponsored: the first was at Little St. Helen's in 1726.) A third course took place at Bury Street, St. Mary-Axe, in 1733, this last set being printed in 1735. These lecture series retained their influence a century later, Samuel Miller writing that \\"The Lime Street and Bury Street Lectures, contain some of the most able, useful, and pious disquisitions of the English dissenting divines.\\"Samuel Miller, The Spruce Street Lectures (1840), p. xv. In the spring of 1734 he contemplated founding a dissenting academy at Walthamstow, for the education of children of Dissenters for the ministry, and the post of professor of divinity was offered to Philip Doddridge, after hesitations over whether Taylor should have the position. The scheme itself came to nothing, although Coward continued, while alive, to assist the poorer ministers and to aid in the teaching of their children. He died at Walthamstow on 28 April 1738, aged ninety. Legacy Coward's property was valued at ¬£150,000, and the bulk was said to have been left in charity in a will dated 25 November 1735. Property was left in trust \\"for the education and training up of young men ... between 15 and 22, to qualify them for the ministry of the gospel among the protestant dissenters.\\" There were four trustees of the Coward Trust, including initially Isaac Watts and Daniel Neal, who were to take care that the students should be instructed according to \\"the assembly's catechism, and in that method of church discipline which is practised by the congregational churches.\\" For many years two educational institutions, conveniently known as Daventry Academy and Hoxton Academy (both in practice moved their locations at need), were almost entirely maintained from the income of the trusts. In the London region (in fact east of the city as it then was, in the area of Hackney) there was an academy run first by David Jennings, a Bury Street lecturer and another of the original trustees, then taken over by Samuel Morton Savage, who moved it after 1762 from his own residence in Wellclose Square to Hoxton Square. The London establishment relied on the Coward Trust after withdrawal of support from the Independent or Congregational Fund Board, and for some period had no students underwritten by the Presbyterian Fund Board; it never achieved the same reputation as Daventry, despite having Andrew Kippis and Abraham Rees (a former pupil of Jennings) as tutors. Among its well-known pupils was William Godwin, refused entry to the nearby Homerton Academy on suspicion of Sandemanian tendencies, and a student at the Hoxton Academy from 1773. In 1785 the grant was withdrawn from the Hoxton Academy.A later Hoxton Academy was run by George Collison; it is unconnected. The \\"Daventry\\" academy took over Doddridge's Northampton establishment, in which Coward had earlier shown an interest. Its best-known student was Joseph Priestley. In 1833, following several moves, it relocated to London, to Byng Place, south of the Catholic Apostolic Church, where its final home had been built by Thomas Cubitt the year before. Here it was known as Coward College and \\"remained as a residential College for Theological Students until May, 1850\\",'Coward College, Byng Place', Survey of London: volume 21: The parish of St Pancras part 3: Tottenham Court Road & neighbourhood (1949), pp. 91.

It was built as a successor of the brewery founded in 1325, as a part of Cistercian convent. The brewery was named Starobrno Brewery only in the second half of the 19th century. In 2009, Starobrno Brewery produced more than one million hectoliters of beer. The same year, the brewery merged with the Royal Brewery of Kru≈°ovice and became a part of the Dutch brewing company Heineken.  History  Starobrno Brewery, Brno City The beginnings of the brewery were connected with the Cistercian convent, built by Elisabeth Richeza of Poland, and located in the Old Brno district. The brewery was initially independent from the city council; it was managed by a burgher named Mo≈ôic. However, the quality of the beer was strictly controlled by the city councillors. During the Hussite Wars in the first half of the 15th century, the brewery and convent buildings were burned down several times, but were always restored in something like their old form. Following the Battle of White Mountain, in 1624, the city of Brno was forced to pay a special charge per beer, called \\"pivn√≠ t√°c\\". After the successful defense of the city against Swedish sieges in 1645, Brno was allowed to levy the charge for its own purposes. In 1782, the convent was closed by decision of emperor Joseph II, and the property passed to the hands of St Thomas's Abbey. There is no evidence of the existence of the brewery between 1782 and 1825, as the archives were destroyed. Half-litre of Starobrno The second half of the 19th century in the Czech lands was marked by expansion of the brewing industry. The outdated equipment and the low capacity of the Old Brno brewery were insufficient for increasing demands of the rapidly growing city. The last owners of the original brewery, Josef Mandel and his son-in-law Herrmann Hayek therefore decided to build new, representative and modern brewing buildings. In 1872, the company \\"Mandel a Hayek\\" began construction of a new brewery on \\"V hlink√°ch\\" street. The buildings of the former brewery were used to construct a new malt-house. In the last decade of the 19th century, the brewery merged with another brewing company, located in Brnƒõnsk√© Ivanovice. The production was moved to the new capacities in Old Brno. At the end of the 19th century, the annual production of the consolidated brewery was 236,490 hectoliters. Up to the beginning of World War I, the company managed to overtake a major part of the competitors on the market in Brno, and production grew to 250,000 hectoliters yearly. The beer from Brno was exported to Poland and Austria‚ÄìHungary; the brewery supplied Vienna market with five wagons of beer daily. The owners of the company in that time were Germans; the first Czech shareholders came to the brewery only in 1911. In 1918, after the establishment of the new Czechoslovak State, the brewery passed into the hands of Moravian Bank. The import of the beer focused more on the Slovak market. The business activities of the company reached their highest level around 1927, however, the subsequent Great Depression caused a short decline for the brewery. The final result of the weak years was positive, Starobrno Brewery managed to beat its main rival on the market, Moravia Brewery. During the World War II, the company was led by Germans. The brewery suffered damages during the bombing of Brno in November 1944, and was subsequently heavily damaged by passing front. Throughout the second half of the 20th century, the brewery has been modernized on several occasions. Its modern history dates from 1992, when the structure of the brewery changed to a joint-stock company. The same year, it was awarded first prize in the beer exhibition PIVEX. In 1994, Starobrno became a part of the Austrian concern BBAG (√ñsterreichische BrauBeteiligungs AG). The merger between BBAG and Heineken Group in 2003 allowed for the establishment of the most important brewing company in Middle Europe.  Production  A selection of Starobrno bottles In 2009, Starobrno Brewery produced more than one million hectoliters of beer, for the first time in its history. Starobrno produces these different brands of beer in regular production, all beers are unpasteurised: *Star√© Brno ‚Äì a pale 10¬∞ draught beer with 4.0% ABV (in Czech:V√Ωƒçepn√≠). *Starobrno Medium ‚Äì a pale 11¬∞ lager with 4.7% ABV (in Czech:Le≈æ√°k). *Starobrno Drak ‚Äì a pale 12¬∞ lager with 5.3% ABV (in Czech:Le≈æ√°k). *Starobrno Unfiltered ‚Äì an unfiltered 12¬∞ lager with 5.0% ABV (in Czech:Nefiltrovan√Ω). Aside from its standard production, the brewery produces a special batch of green beer, which is produced only once per year and distributed on Maundy Thursday. The Czech term for this Christian holiday is \\"Green Thursday\\" (\\"zelen√Ω ƒçtvrtek\\") and the unusual color of the beer is inspired by this feast.  Craft series  On 18th of March 2020 Starobrno brewery presented three new kinds of beer, inspired by craft beer styleshttps://pivovari.cz/2020/03/18/starobrno-predstavilo-tri-druhy- remeslneho-piva/: *Indian Pale Lager - IPL - a pale lager with 5% ABV *American Pale Ale - APA - a top-fermented beer with 5% ABV *RED - a cherry- flavoured beer with 3.6% ABV.

The UK reacted to a call for protection from Sheikh Abdullah III Al- Salim Al-Sabah of Kuwait, and air, sea and land forces were in place within days. Iraq did not attack and the British forces were replaced by the Arab League. Iraq recognised Kuwaiti independence in 1963. Background In 1958, Abdul Karim Qasim seized power in Iraq. He was seen by western powers as unpredictable and Iraq as unstable. On 25 June 1961, following Britain's relinquishing authority in Kuwait, Qasim announced that Kuwait would be incorporated into Iraq and the military threat was seen, by Britain, as imminent. The reasons for Iraqi belligerence are debatable, but as well as the political gain to be accrued from a successful military campaign, Kuwait's assets at the time included possible oil reserves (confirmed later) and secure access to the sea, which Iraq lacked. Operation After borders were sealed and defense mounted by Mubarak Abdullah Al-Jaber Al-Sabah and his deputy Colonel Sheikh Saleh Mohammed Al-Sabah against the anticipated invasion, Brigadier General Sheikh Mubarak advised Kuwait's 11th Ruler and 1st Emir Sheikh Abdullah III Al-Salim Al-Sabah to invoke Section 4 of the independence agreement, which stated that Kuwait could ask Britain for military support, which was done on 30 June 1961. Britain had accepted responsibility for Kuwait's military protection and quickly sent a strong naval task force, which included Royal Marines from 42 Commando, on , aircraft carrier (subsequently relieved by ), destroyers , , and , frigates HMS Chichester F59 , , , , , and , amphibious landing ship , and the 108th Minesweeper Squadron. The Royal Air Force sent 2 Canberra Reconnaissance aircraft, of 13 Squadron based in Cyprus, which flew daily sorties to photograph the border. A troop of 42 Commando arrived by helicopter from Bulwark at the airport as a squadron of Hawker Hunters arrived. By 1 July Britain had half of a brigade group in Kuwait ready for action. These included 42 and 45 Marine Commandos and two companies of 2nd Coldstream Guards. 3rd Carabiniers' \\"C\\" squadron landed with their Centurion tanks from . The two Commando groups occupied high ground on and around Mitla Ridge, near the Iraqi border, in fierce summer heat. Brigadier Derek Horsford, Commander, 24th Infantry Brigade Group was rushed from Kenya to Kuwait to take command of the assembled British land forces. In the following days, there were further reinforcements; an artillery battery of the 33rd Parachute Field Regiment, and the 11th Hussars with Ferret scout cars; 2nd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment arrived after a delay through difficulties over-flying Turkey. On 4 July, the 1st Battalion, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and the 34th Field Squadron arrived from Kenya. The Inniskillings and the 1st Battalion, The King's Regiment (Manchester and Liverpool) relieved 42 and 45 Commandos on 6 and 7 July. There more reinforcements from the UK. The Kuwaiti combat contingent was led by Brigadier General Mubarak and Colonel Saleh Mohammed Al-Sabah who later commanded the Kuwait 25th Commando Brigade and the Kuwait 6th Mechanized Brigade. Aftermath The Arab League took over the protection of Kuwait and the British had withdrawn their forces by 19 October. Qasim was killed in a coup in 1963 but, although Iraq recognised Kuwaiti independence and the military threat was perceived to be reduced, Britain continued to monitor the situation and kept forces available to protect Kuwait until 1971. There had been no Iraqi military action against Kuwait at the time: this was attributed to the political and military situation within Iraq which continued to be unstable.

It was the last Slingsby sailplane to be mostly constructed of wood. Development The Slingsby Dart was the last of a long line of gliders and sailplanes built by Slingsby Sailplanes Ltd almost entirely from wood. From the Slingsby Skylark 2 of 1953 onwards, the company had used Gaboon ply, thicker but less dense than the traditional birch for surfacing wings and fuselage, as it gave a smoother surface capable of maintaining the more demanding profiles of the newer aerofoils. The Capstan flew ten years later with double curvature parts of the fuselage skin produced from glass-reinforced plastic (G.R.P). Combined, these were the construction methods initially used for the Dart. The Dart was originally a 15 m sailplane, aimed immediately at the 1964 UK Gliding Championships and beyond at the 1965 World Championships.Flight 16 January 1964 p.92 Its wings were shoulder mounted, with 2o dihedral and about 0.75o forward sweep at quarter chord. They were built around spruce spars with a plywood covered torsion box ahead to the leading edge, fabric covered behind and with plywood covered ailerons. The mid-chord airbrakes were arranged as pairs above and below the wings. The fuselage seemed notably long and slender at the time, and the tail unit small. It was a semi-monocoque spruce structure, plywood covered apart from the G.R.P in the cockpit area, with the single piece canopy hinged on the starboard side. The original tail unit was again a spruce structure with G.R.P. leading edges, its all moving tailplane mounted low on the fin, though later aircraft used a metal framed tailplane. The rudder and the rear part of the tailplane were fabric covered, the latter carrying trim tabs. On early aircraft the undercarriage was a non-retractable single wheel placed under the leading edge of the wing, plus a short skid under the nose and a tail bumper. The Dart first flew on 26 November 1963. Four were entered into the National Gliding Competition in May 1964, but failed to impress in the light conditions of the first few days.Flight 4 June 1964 p.939-400 It became increasingly clear that the speed of the Dart could not compensate in typical English conditions for the high minimum sink rate resulting from its high wing loading of 5.6 lb/sq ft (27.3 kg/m2). Since the 1965 World Championships were also scheduled for the UK, Slingsby decided to increase the wing area by stretching the span to 17 m, making the Dart an entrant for the Open Class. Initially this version also had a wooden wing spar, but some distortion noticed when the airbrakes were extended led to a redesigned spar of mixed metal and wood construction. The new wing was also fitted with a trailing edge root extension and a 1 ft (0.305 m) increase in aileron length and this version of the Dart became known as the Dart 17. The first Dart 17 used an undercarriage with a less extended wheel, fitted in a fairing but almost allList of Darts later ones were fitted with a retracting undercarriage.Flight 27 May 1965 p.839-41 The later Dart 15s used a similar metal and wood spar and had the root fillet, producing a net weight saving of 45 lb (21 kg) and a corresponding improvement in sink rate. Most Dart 15s retained the fixed wheel undercarriage to allow them to compete as Standard Class. Darts with retractable gear are known as the 17R. Operational history The 1965 World Championships saw only modest success for the Darts: a Dart 15 finished 5th in the Standard Class event and the Dart 17 came 7th in the Open Class.Flight 24 June 1965 p.10291 82 complete Darts of both spans are known to have been built. Overall, rather more of the large- span Darts were made. One had removable wing tips, so it could fly in either class. Two special Dart 15s, designated Dart 15W were produced for the Standard Class at the 1968 World Championships with wings using a new aerofoil section and a revised canopy. After the competition, in which they were not highly placed,Flight 6 June 1968 p.862 their wings were extended to 17 m and they were redesignated Dart 17W; later fitted with the retractable undercarriage, they became 17WRs. Several Darts were built from kits in New Zealand and flew there. Others were exported to Burma, Canada, Rhodesia, Switzerland and the USA.

Today it is a conference venue for the Evangelical Church of the Church Province of Saxony with an educational-theological institute and pastoral centre.  History  The Abbey of Dr√ºbeck was supposedly mentioned for the first time in a document dated 26 January 877. However, this has been exposed as a forgery. Thus a deed by the Holy Roman Emperor Otto I, dated 10 September 960, is seen as the first confirmed record of the Drubechi Abbey. In 995, Emperor Otto III confirmed the election of \\"free\\" abbesses () (i.e., without imperial or episcopal oversight) and thus the special legal position of the abbey. This meant that during the 10th century the foundation enjoyed privileges like those of the Imperial Abbeys () in Gandersheim and Quedlinburg. During the turmoil of the Protestant Reformation, the German Peasants' War and the Thirty Years War, monastic life died out. At the end of the 17th century the abbey buildings were transferred to the Counts of Stolberg-Wernigerode, who established an evangelical convent there in 1732. At the request of the last abbess, Countess Magdalena of Stolberg-Wernigerode, the Evangelical Church Province of Saxony took over the abbey in 1946 as a convalescent home and conference centre.  Construction  The earliest record of its construction dates to 1 August 1004. From a deed signed by Emperor Henry II it emerges that either a new monastery was erected or a major renovation had taken place. It was designed as a flat-roofed church with three double bays and simple alternation of piers and columns (St√ºtzenwechsel) in the nave. Even today the walls of the central nave, five columns with Ottonian capitals and the southern wing of the transept retain this structure. In very recent times new excavations have taken place, which have revealed the northern aisle that had been lost around 1660, as well as part of an angular foundation in the area of the transept. This could have belonged to a previous building. In the 12th century extensive modifications were carried out: the imposing west transom with its two towers was built, the church was arched and the tiered stalls added. During the peasants' war the building was badly damaged. In 1599 a fire was started by a band of robbers, whose ringleader was never captured. After makeshift repairs, more modifications were carried out during the Baroque era. In the 20th century attempts have been made to recover the original structure in places and the crypt was re-opened to its halfway point. The abbey buildings are part of the Romanesque Road, a tourist route in Saxony-Anhalt. Grave slab of St. Adelbrin (d. ca. 900) Adelbrin was the legendary first abbess of the monastery. The non-contemporary grave monument is preserved in the crypt of the church which is accessible from the outside. It is sandstone grave slab engraved with figures and leaning against a wall. The narrow side leans on a plain grave slab. Adelbrin was the legendary founder of the abbey and a saint. She is believed to be the sister of the two founders of the abbey, Theti and Wikker. Gardens The abbey gardens are part of the tourist project \\"Dream Gardens - Historic Parks in Saxony-Anhalt\\". The present external area was recreated in Anhalt based on a plan drawn by J. A. Dieckmann in 1737. Following the abbey's acquisition at that time by the Counts of Stolberg-Wernigerode, the courtyard and gardens were relaid. As part of this the convent gardens with their prayer houses and the abbess's gardens were established; these remain part of the garden scenery even today. Around 1730, as part of this renovation, a lime tree was planted in the abbey courtyard. This \\"abbey lime\\" - almost 300 years old - is now a natural monument for the district of Harz.

The last regular services to operate north of Armidale was the Northern Mail which ceased in November 1988.\\"Requiem for a Mail\\" Railway Digest January 1989 page 14 Freight services continued to serve a fertilizer depot at Dumaresq until the mid-2000s, after which the line closed north of Armidale. History Armidale railway precinct is located on the Main North line, which runs from Sydney and extends as far as Wallangarra on the Queensland border. The Main North Line (formerly known as the Great Northern Railway) runs through the Central Coast, Hunter and New England regions. The line was the original main line between Sydney and Brisbane, however this required a change of gauge at Wallangarra. The line is now closed north of Armidale, and the main route between Brisbane and Sydney is now the North Coast line. Armidale was first settled in the early 1830s, following the earlier exploration of the area by John Oxley. Oxley recommended the region for grazing, and soon early pioneers set up small farms in the locality. Armidale, which was surveyed in 1848 and gazetted in 1849, was established to provide a market and administration centre for the farms. The town grew rapidly following the discovery of gold at nearby Rocky River and Gara Gorges in the 1850s.Burke, 1995 Although the opening of the Great Northern Railway occurred on 30 March 1857, political indecision in the 1870s hampered efforts by Engineer-in-Chief of the NSW Railways, John Whitton, to finalise the survey of the Great Northern line. Competing proposals urged a route via Armidale and Tenterfield against a less developed but easier route through Barraba and Inverell. On 18 May 1878, the Minister for Public Works, John Sutherland, announced that the chosen route was via Armidale. The line to Armidale opened on 3 February 1883 as an extension of the line from Uralla and continued on to Glen Innes the following year. The construction contract for the Uralla to Glen Innes section was awarded to D Proudfoot in . Contracts for the construction of a station building, Station Master's residence, lamp room, carriage dock and buffer, goods shed, and water tank were awarded in 1882 to Edmund Lonsdale (1843 -1913). Lonsdale began his working life as a bricklayer, builder and contractor before beginning a career in state politics (1891-1913), serving as a member for New England and Armidale. The fine cast iron work of the station building was completed at New England Foundry in Uralla by Henry Sheldon Goddard.Forsyth, 2009; Cottee, 2004; SRA 1993 In addition to the station building, other early structures and additions to the yard included the 1882 loco depot, 1891 coal stage, a new 18.288 metre turntable in 1899, extensions to the platform in 1907 and in 1912, and a signal box in 1918.Cottee, 2004; SRA, 1993 The loco depot closed in 1984 but Armidale remains an operational railway station with daily Countrylink passenger services.

It is also served by weekly (Tuesday only) NSW TrainLink coach service to Inverell and daily NSW TrainLink coach service to Tenterfield. Description The station buildings have a good level of integrity/intactness. Station building (1883) This is a major first class station building constructed of rendered brick with a pavilion at each end. The main booking office is located centrally and is marked by a raised transverse gable roof and separate entrance roof. The entrance is flanked by verandahs with cast iron columns decorated with filigree detailing. The platform awning is largely in the form of the earlier buildings and is also supported on cast iron columns and brackets. The building has a well detailed decorative dentil course with projecting brickwork. The roof is now clad in corrugated iron (formerly slate). Some sections of the verandah have been in-filled as has the section linking the eastern pavilion to the main building. The building does not follow the standard lineal arrangement seen in many railway structure, with the Station Master's office on the street side accessed through the ticket office and parcels, separated from the booking hall with a main street entrance. The building also has two ladies waiting rooms, one at each end of the building. Goods shed (1883) It is a large structure consisting of two sections: the first, is of timber construction built in 1883 with a gabled, corrugated, galvanised iron roof that overhangs the building, supported by timber braces, and provides covering for two loading stages on both sides of the building. The building includes a storeroom and an office, which originally was an annex to the building but is now covered by the second section. The second section is a brick and patent steel extension constructed in 1965 (partly re-clad in the 1980s) that provides a large, covered loading area. The loading crane has been removed. Other structures The station platform dates from 1883 and has a brick face with ramped ends. The brick face dock platform is also heritage-listed. The barracks is a s masonry building and s timber building. It is of brick and timber construction with a covered verandah (12.5 m). It is possibly the oldest extant drivers' rest house, although the roof not original. The former per way offices and sheds is a corrugated, galvanised iron structure currently housing a trike collection. The 1899 turntable is of 18.2m diameter and is also separately listed on the New South Wales Heritage Register. The station sign, scales, station clock and fences are also heritage-listed.  Heritage listing  Armidale railway precinct is of state significance, particularly for the grand, 19th century, first class station building that exhibits significant architectural and aesthetic attributes and reflects the importance of Armidale as a major regional centre and significant railway location (now the terminus of the northern line). The railway precinct at Armidale includes a significant station and railway yard dating from a period of extensive railway construction in NSW in the late 19th century. The station building and other extant structures at Armidale demonstrate the rapid expansion of railway infrastructure in the 1880s in the New England region and in other parts of NSW. The station building is an excellent and mostly intact example of late 19th-century railway station architecture in NSW and retains good detailing. The station building is still in use and remains a major civic building and an important element within the townscape of Armidale. Armidale railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Armidale railway precinct is significant for its historical values as a tangible link to the development of the Great Northern Railway (GNR) line during the 19th century as well as the development of the NSW railways generally. The GNR was an important achievement in transport and engineering within NSW. As the third main trunk rail route in NSW stretching from Sydney to the Queensland border, the line linked townships to one another as well as to Sydney leading to significant economic and social impacts for those individual townships as well as for NSW more generally. The station building and railway yard at Armidale date from a period of extensive railway construction in NSW in the late 19th century and are closely associated with the rapid expansion of railway infrastructure in the New England region and in other parts of NSW in the 1880s. The station and yard reflect the importance of Armidale as a major regional centre which warranted a notable station building and large forecourt area. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Armidale railway station is associated with a significant Armidale identity, Edmund Lonsdale, who built the station building and later served as a NSW state parliamentarian for over 20 years. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The station building is state significant for its high level of aesthetic significance. Armidale is a large, first class station building with a high level of decorative detailing. The building has a significant presence within the townscape of Armidale. The place is has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The railway precinct is of social significance to the local community, having performed an important role in supporting the town as a regional centre for agricultural commerce and thereby being the site of significant activity and employment. The railway station contributes to the local community's sense of place and displays continuity of use since the 1880s, providing a connection to the local community's past. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Armidale has research potential and significance as a historic, representative landmark, rural railway station building and precinct. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The railway precinct includes a representative collection of railway structures; particularly the station building which is a good representative example of first-class railway architecture in NSW. The precinct collectively demonstrates widespread 19th and early 20th Century railway customs, activities and design in NSW.

After Iraq ordered French turrets in September 1974 capable of launching antitank guided missiles (ATGM), the Panhard VCR was developed at the request of the Iraqis for vehicles with which to mate these ATGM-launcher turrets.JAA, p. 527. This resulted in the largest order of VCRs, 100, for Iraq.Foss, pp. 368‚Äì369. Description The VCR is a 6√ó6 wheeled APC designed in the late 1970s and is based on the earlier 4√ó4 M-3 APC which had been a huge success for Panhard on the export market, with over 1,200 built. Production of the VCR began in 1979. The center pair of wheels can be raised when the vehicle is operated on roads (when down all six wheels drive). The engine is located in the front to the right, with the driver in the front-center of the vehicle. The VCR has 8 mm of steel armor on all sides except the front which has 12 mm. This gives protection against 12.7 mm AP rounds in the front and against 7.62 mm AP rounds on all other sides.C. Foss Armored Fighting Vehicles of the World page 31. The basic VCR is the APC version, the VCR/TT (Transport de Troupes), designed such that various weapons can be mated with the basic vehicle in a series of variants. The basic weapons option was either a 7.62mm light machine gun or a 12.7 mm heavy machine gun, on a ring mount located on the left-front roof. The VCR can also be fitted with a ring mount with a one-man armored turret with a 7.62 mm machine gun or a one-man armored powered turret mounting a 20-mm automatic cannon located at the front-center of the vehicle roof. One option that led to the first large export order from Iraq for a hundred VCR vehicles was a tank-destroyer version of the VCR/TT fitted with an antitank missile turret for launching the HOT wire guided ATGM (antitank guided missile). The ATGM variant was known as the VCR/TH (Tourelle HOT). The VCR/TH mounts four HOT missiles on the turret ready to fire with ten reloads inside the vehicle. There was a less expensive version of the VCR/TH offered that mounted the MCT cupola which fires the shorter range MILAN antitank missile, but there were no orders for this version. Besides the three crew, the basic VCR/TT can transport nine infantrymen. Other versions included: ;VCR/AT :A recovery vehicle, the VCR/AT, with a heavy duty crane mounted on the roof over the back side, tool chest for two mechanics, working bench, welding equipment, spare parts and a towing bar. ;VCR/IS :An ambulance version, the VCR/IS, which has provision for three stretchers (four in an emergency for quick transport) and a medic, heavy duty air conditioning system, water supply, a refrigerator, electric sterilizer, medical cupboards and a large tent that can be erected from the rear of the vehicle. ;VCR/PC :A command post vehicle, the VCR/PC, with provisions for three radio operators, a long range transmitter and a short range transmitter, and four heavy duty storage batteries to provide power when the vehicle is stopped for long periods. There is also an electronic warfare vehicle based on the VCR/PC, fitted to customer requirements for intercepting and jamming enemy radio communications. ;VCR/TT \\"Hydrojet\\" :This unique modification of the VCR/TT is a 4x4 variant produced for Argentina. The VCR/TT \\"Hydrojet\\" 4x4 amphibious variant replaces the center wheel stations with powerful waterjets, doubling the water speed over the standard 6X6 VCR-TT which relies on its wheels for water propulsion. The waterjets are placed in the center wheel position to protect them against obstacles in the water.

The film, based upon Durang's 1979 play Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All For You, and starring Diane Keaton in the title role, premiered on the Showtime network.  Background  The project was filmed in Toronto in association with Columbia TriStar Television. The theme was originally covered in Christopher Durang's controversial 1979 stage play. In updating the character of Sister Mary, Durang read through 15 earlier drafts of the screenplay and discussed changes with Brickman and the producers. The original film title was Sister Mary, but Durang felt the proffered title was too generic, preferring the original theatrical title. For the film, Keaton was Brickman's choice for the role, which was cast against type, and she accepted the part because she thought she couldn't do it. The Catholic League objected to the depiction of Catholicism in the film and took out a full-page advertisement in Variety to protest its broadcast. William A. Donohue, the president of the Catholic League, called for a boycott of Viacom, Showtime's parent company.  Plot  Sister Mary (Diane Keaton) is an authoritarian Catholic nun who teaches children. Her teaching is heavily influenced by her fanatical beliefs.

He noted that the film did not have the same theatricality of Durang's initial work, and that with the original stageplay constructed for the audience's participation, the film included actors as representing broad characterizations of the play's audiences. Oxman concluded that the film might have perhaps remained truer to the original play had Sister Mary delivered her lecture directly to her unseen television audience.  Recognition  Max Morrow received a 2002 Young Artist Award nomination for 'Best Performance in a TV Movie or Special ‚Äî Supporting Young Actor' for his role of Thomas.

Early life  Obadiah Bruen Brown was born in Newark, New Jersey, on July 20, 1779, the son of Mary Bruen Brown and Brown. Raised a Presbyterian, Brown started attending the Baptist Church when it was organized in Newark. At age 24, he joined this church and soon the members of the congregation began encouraging him to enter the ministry. Within a few months, O.B. Brown had gone to Scotch Plains, New Jersey, to study theology with the Rev. William Van Horn, pastor of the most prominent Baptist church in the New Jersey-New York area.\\"Obadiah B. Brown: A Neglected, Forgotten Baptist Hero\\", by Rev. John C. Hillhouse, Jr. 1993  Ministry  Brown was invited to Washington, D.C. in 1807 to preach several sermons as a test of his ability. The Washington First Baptist Church voted, without a dissenting vote, to appoint him as their first pastor. The church could not financially support a pastor. So Brown obtained a clerkship in the United States Post Office and eventually held the post of Chief of the Contract Division. He became the fiscal agent representing several Congressmen in Washington during the months they returned to their home states. He and his wife Elizabeth turned their home into a boardinghouse.\\"Obadiah B. Brown: A Neglected, Forgotten Baptist Hero\\", by Rev. John C.

At the encouragement of President James Monroe, Brown was among a group of Baptist leaders who created the Columbian College, which decades later became the George Washington University. On February 8, 1821, the College was formally chartered by Congress. The college property was in Obadiah Brown's name on the deed.

The film was broadcast on CBS on December 9, 1980. Plot A divorcee, Zoe Jensen (Michael Learned), moves to San Francisco from Omaha in an effort to rebuild her life. She has reluctantly left her young son back home with his grandmother until she is more financially secure. She joins a local church choir which has just gained a new, demanding choirmaster‚Äîretired music conductor Ephraim Adams (John Houseman). Adams challenges the choir to dramatically improve, creating discomfort for some of the members, particularly when he sets the high goal of performing Handel's Messiah for a Christmas concert. Meanwhile, the choir overcome personal setbacks as they all deal with personal issues. A teacher by profession, Zoe soon learns no positions are available and that she lacks training to perform more readily available work. Living in an inexpensive flat, she brushes up her typing skills in order to gain employment before her mother wearies of looking after her son, who is growing anxious from his separation from Zoe. Zoe receives her grounding at church, where an assortment of inner-city residents range from a former opera singer to a student seeking to educate himself for a life in a profession. The opera singer falls by the wayside when ego gets in her way, while the student is falsely accused of vandalism to the church organ simply because of his race, yet is vindicated by those who know and believe in him. Together, they persevere in the church choir. Along the way, Zoe finds an office job and, with the help of a bargain hunter, prepares a pleasant home for her son and herself. Unexpected talent abounds within the choir. The amateurs give their best as ones who perform for the love of the music. This love extends far beyond the choir loft and is exemplified when the choir members band together to make the needed repairs to the organ pipes. At a pre- performance holiday dinner the choir sees a different side of Ephraim Adams as he presents gifts to the choir members and joins in the merriment. Weakness suddenly overtakes him and he collapses; at a local hospital it is determined he has had a stroke. The choir performs Messiah admirably at the Christmas concert, accompanied by the vintage organ, with a wheelchair-bound Adams in attendance. The choir has progressed far beyond an unlikely group of city dwellers. They have become a family.

He was described as, \\"a distinguished labour leader, an eminent journalist, an ardent champion of the causes of handloom weavers, small-scale and cottage industries and a spirited advocate of interests of politically and socially disadvantaged sections of society\\".  Early life  Varadarajulu Naidu was born into the Balija Naidu family of Rasipuram near Salem on 4 June 1887. His father Perumal Naidu was a rich landlord. He had his early education in Madras and trained as an Ayurvedic physician.  Politics  Varadarajulu Naidu entered politics at an early age and joined the Indian National Congress. In 1917, he gave up medical practice. He participated in the Indian Home Rule Movement and was President of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee at the time of the Cheranmahadevi school controversy.  Cheranmadevi school controversy  Varadarajulu joined Periyar and Kalyanasundara Mudaliar and strongly opposed the practice of separate dining for Brahman and non-Brahman students in Shermadevi Gurukulam, a national school run by V. V. S. Aiyar. The issue was brought to the notice of Gandhi and Aiyar later resigned. When the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee met in April 1925 to discuss the issue, the recommendation of C. Rajagopalachari and Rajan that Congress should not interfere and that the school should instead be advised to eliminate the practice was swept aside. The resolution which prevented gradations of merit based on birth should not be observed by nationalist parties moved by Ramanathan passed. Rajagopalachari and six of his associates resigned from TNCC citing that caste prejudices could not be overcome by coercion. However, Varadarajulu Naidu stayed on in the Congress even as Periyar left the party.  Temple entry  In his later years, Varadarajulu Naidu actively participated in the temple-entry movements in Madras Presidency.  Journalism  Varadarajulu started the weekly Tamil newspaper Tamil Nadu in 1925. In 1931, Varadarajulu Naidu started The Indian Express but had to sell off the newspaper within a year due to financial difficulties.  Personal life  Naidu had three daughters and six sons. His eldest son, Krishnadas, died in June 2012. Three of the his sons had served the Armed Forces. His son Dayanandan retired in 1993 as a Colonel from the Army. Naidu's son-in-law, K.L.K.

He was described as the Prime Minister's \\"first and only choice\\" to replace Heywood, with no recruitment process taking place and some suggesting the urgency of arrangements for the UK's departure from the European Union as a reason for the quick appointment. Prime Minister Theresa May was criticised for allowing Sedwill to remain as National Security Adviser alongside his role as Cabinet Secretary, with speculation that the role was being kept for Europe adviser Oliver Robbins. In a February 2019 interview Sedwill said he would retain his role as National Security Adviser to the Prime Minister since becoming Cabinet Secretary is part of moves to make a success of Brexit. In an interview with Civil Service Quarterly, Sedwill said retaining the post would also ensure a \\"genuine sense of teamwork across and beyond government\\". In April 2019 it was reported that Sedwill had written to ministers on the National Security Council and their special advisers after The Daily Telegraph reported details of a meeting about Chinese telecoms company Huawei. Following the meeting of the council, the Telegraph reported that it had agreed to allow Huawei limited access to help build Britain's new 5G network, amid warnings about possible risks to national security. Several cabinet ministers have denied they were involved. In July 2019, The Times reported that two unnamed senior civil servants had said the 70-year-old Jeremy Corbyn might have to stand down due to health issues. The article drew an angry response from Labour, which denounced the comments as a \\"scurrilous\\" attempt to undermine the party's efforts to gain power. Downing Street said that Sedwill would write to Corbyn after the party demanded an inquiry into alleged comments. It is unclear whether he will order an investigation. Corbyn has said the civil service has a duty to be non-political. In November 2019, Sedwill blocked the publication of a document written by civil servants to cost the Labour Party's fiscal plans before a general election. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell had complained to Treasury Permanent Secretary Tom Scholar in a meeting arguing it would interfere in the upcoming general election. In June 2020, it was announced that Sedwill would be stepping down from his civil service appointments in September 2020. The Telegraph said that Downing Street regarded Sedwill as \\"too much of a Europhile and establishment figure\\" to be in post through planned Whitehall reforms. Sedwill will be replaced as national security adviser by David Frost, currently serving as Johnson‚Äôs chief negotiator in talks on the post-Brexit trade and security relationship with the EU. Frost is a political appointment, while all previous national security advisers have been civil servants.independent.co.uk 28 June 2020: [ Cabinet secretary and top civil servant to step down in September - Boris Johnson‚Äôs supporters accused of undermining cabinet secretary through anonymous briefings] Sedwill was replaced as Cabinet Secretary and Head of the Home Civil Service by Simon Case on 9 September 2020.  Personal life  Sedwill married in 1999 and has one daughter. He is a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, Fellow of the Institute of Directors and President of the Special Forces Club.  Honours  He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 2008 Birthday Honours, and a Knight Commander in the 2018 New Year Honours. On 11 September 2020 he was created Baron Sedwill, of Sherborne in the County of Dorset.

It is found on reefs in the Atlantic Ocean, the Indo-Pacific region and the Mediterranean Sea. Halimeda tuna is the type species of the genus Halimeda and the type locality is the Mediterranean Sea. The specific name \\"tuna\\" comes from the Ta√≠no language, meaning \\"cactus\\" and referring to the resemblance of the thallus to the growth form of an Opuntia cactus.  Description  Halimeda tuna is a calcareous green seaweed, attached to the seabed by a holdfast. Each individual thallus (frond) consists of a single cell forming a tube with multiple cell nuclei. The cytoplasm is mobile and the nuclei, chloroplasts and other cell contents are free to move around inside the cell wall. The tube has flattened, disc-like segments connected by flexible joints. The surface of these segments have swollen areas called utricles which together make a tabular \\"cellular pavement\\". Below and between these utricles, there are gaps and it is here that the fluid is saturated with calcium carbonate and crystalline needles of aragonite form. These stiffen the segments and make the seaweed unpalatable to fish. When the seaweed dies, this skeletal material breaks down into \\"sand\\". Members of this genus are likely to be one of the most important agents of calcification in the marine environment, considerably more productive in tropical seas than stony corals.  Distribution  This species is found in the tropical and subtropical Indo- Pacific region, the Mediterranean Sea and the western Atlantic Ocean. It grows on rocky reefs from the shallow subtidal zone down to depths of about . In the Mediterranean Sea it occurs in two separate habitat types; shallow, warm lagoons and sheltered places in the central Mediterranean and deep water () rocky habitats in the northwest Mediterranean. Similarly, in the Florida Keys, it is the dominant green alga in shallow back reef locations and in much deeper, less well lit, reef slope habitats.  Ecology  The thallus of this seaweed is often overgrown by epiphytes which are at their maximum abundance in summer. The segments are sometimes damaged by storms, but are replaced by new growth which occurs with rising temperatures and increasing amounts of irradiation and dissolved nutrients. In the deepwater habitats in the Mediterranean, it is the dominant species and is often found in association with the encrusting red alga Mesophyllum lichenoides. In this habitat it tends to grow on vertical walls, under overhangs and in positions where it receives little sunlight. Its adaptation to dim light is assisted by its containing two accessory photosynthetic pigments, the green-absorbing carotenoids siphonein and siphonaxanthin, as well as chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b. In Florida, reproductive events occurred simultaneously across the reef, with up to 5% of thalli developing gametangia. Asexual reproduction also occurred through fragmentation or the growth of vegetative stolons.  Human uses  This seaweed has been described as pleasant to eat with oil, vinegar, and salt.

In his works, particularly in his paintings from the 1980s, he expressed a position different from the norm, commemorating The Holocaust in Israeli art. In addition, he created in his works a connection between bereavement and homoerotic sexuality, in the way he criticized society and Israeli Zionism-nationalism. He was awarded the Israel Prize for Painting for his work in 2003, but in the end it was revoked and he was deprived of receiving the prize. Biography Moshe Gershuni was born in 1936 to Yona and Zvi Kutner, who had migrated to British Mandate Palestine from Poland. Zvi, the head of the family, who was an agronomist and farmer, \\"hebraicized\\" the family name from Kutner to Gershuni, after his father. His mother Yona, n√©e Senior, acted in community theater in Poland and made hats in Tel Aviv. The family lived in Tel Aviv on Hahashmal Street, and in 1939 moved to Mazeh Street. In 1938 Mira, Moshe's sister, was born, and in 1943, his brother Avshalom was born. Moshe was sent to the religious Bilu School and then continued his studies in a religious high school. His father managed to save several family members from The Holocaust by arranging immigration certificates (certifikatim) to British Mandate Palestine, but some of his mother's relatives perished in the Holocaust. Gershuni described in a late interview the presence of the Holocaust in his childhood: \\"My mother was troubled all the rest of her life that she had not succeeded in bringing them here. And, like many others, I remember the years after the war [...] I remember that I read everything I could on the subject, there were already personal accounts of it on the radio, in private conversations, from the relatives who arrived. [...] it was in my consciousness, it was almost the center of my consciousness, in spite of the fact that my early years included the founding of the State and the war with the Arabs, but everything was a function of that experience.\\"Interview with Rachel Berger, January 10, 2006, cited in: \\"Berger, R., The Impact of the Holocaust on the Israeli Visual Arts of the 'First Generation',\\" doctoral dissertation, Tel Aviv University, 2008, p. 187-188. [Hebrew] In 1952 the family moved from Tel Aviv to Herzliya, near to the family-owned orchards, in the Gan Rashal area. In 1954, Gershuni's induction into the army was postponed by half a year because he was underweight, but the date of induction in 1955 was also postponed by the death of his father in an auto accident. Gershuni took over his father's job in the orchards. After his father's death Gershuni began to move into the world of art. The painter Leon Fouturian and the sculptor Uri Shoshany, both residents of Herzliya, influenced him. From 1960 to 1964 he studied sculpture in night courses at Avni Institute of Art and Design, after days spent working in the orchards. His teachers were Dov Feigin and Moshe Sternschuss, members of the \\"New Horizons\\" group, which during these years was beginning to lose the central place it had held in the world of Israeli art. In 1964 he married Bianca Eshel, who was also a student in the Avni Institute and a widow of an Israeli Air Force pilot who had been killed in the Sinai Campaign. After the wedding the couple moved to Ra'anana. In addition to Eshel's daughter from her first marriage, a son, Aram Gershuni, was born to them in 1967 and a second son, Uri Gershuni, in 1970. From \\"Pre-Conceptual\\" Art to \\"Post-Minimalist\\" Art, 1969‚Äì79 Presence, Absence, Body = Gershuni's artistic path began with abstract sculpture, strongly influenced by pop art. His first solo exhibition was mounted in 1969 in the Israel Museum. On the walls of the Museum were hung yellowish green abstract paintings in a geometric style, and throughout the space of the exhibition itself were strewn objects made of soft materials influenced by the sculptor Claes Oldenburg.See: Gideon Ofrat, \\"Gershuni in Gray,\\" Studio 40 (January 1993): 22 [Hebrew]. In the 1970s Gershuni produced a series of works influenced by the conceptual art of Europe and America. Yona Fischer who, in his position as Curator of the Israel Museum during those years, encouraged these trends, in retrospect stated that \\"the understanding that conceptual activity was what was developing here was not yet fully focused.\\"See: Haim Maor, \\"Yona Fischer, Concept + Information,\\" Studio 40 (January 1993): 16. [Hebrew]. As the influence of conceptual art, particularly American conceptual art, seeped in, \\"post-minimalist\\" art, which was concerned with examining the material values of art (Formalism), while attempting to strengthen the status of artistic activity, began to develop in Israel. In addition, this type of art emphasized the ontological dimension of artistic works. Instead of objectives with a commercial aesthetic, this genre adopted a freer relationship with minimalist values and emphasized the exposure of the process of the artist at work.See: Adi Engelman, \\"Post Minimalism: 'That's What This Is': On the Contents and the Search for Significant Sites in the Works in the Exhibition,\\" in D.I.Y. The Michael Adler Collection and Israeli Post-Minimalism in the Seventies and in Contemporary Art (Herzliya: Herzliya Museum of Art, 2008), 50-51. [Hebrew] At the same time it examined and subverted the values of society with regard to its political and social views. Gershuni's first important works made use of automobile tires (\\"Inner Tubes\\"). The use of this material constituted a continuation of his preoccupation with soft materials, but Gershuni introduced new characteristics which had been absent in his work before. In \\"The Spirit is Willing, But the Flesh is Weak\\" (1969), for example, Gershuni exhibited inner tubes lined up in a row along a wall. The title of the work, taken from \\"Gospel of Matthew (Matthew 26:41),\\" referred to the gap between the body and the spirit, and between the perception of reality and human consciousness. A similar work was exhibited in 1970 in the \\"Group Autumn Exhibition\\" in the Helena Rubenstein Pavilion for Contemporary Art. Gershuni created a large sculptural installation called \\"Inner Tubes,\\"In Gideon Ofrat's article, it's a \\"4 X 4\\" vehicle. See: Gideon Ofrat, \\"Gershuni in Gray,\\" Studio 40 (January 1993): 22 [Hebrew]. which included rows of 64 tire inner tubes arranged in piles and creating a net (\\"grid\\") in the style of minimalist art.See: Ellen Ginton, \\"\\"The Eyes of the Nation: Visual Art in a Country Without Boundaries \\" (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1998), 50-52. The work received broad public exposure because of a television reporter on Channel 1 who visited the exhibition and focused on Gershuni's sculpture as an uncompromisingly curious object.See: Sarah Breitberg-Semel, Gershuni (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2010), 37. [Hebrew] Another work that shows Gershuni's ironic relationship with the grid is \\"Margarine Cubes on Paper\\" (1970). The work documented, in effect, an activity in which margarine cubes melted into the paper, while emphasizing the sensual aspect of the material. A reinforcement of this tendency can be seen in two videos Gershuni prepared for a television show created by Jacques Katmor for Israeli Television. In the video clip \\"Crawling\\" (1970; 32 seconds, black and white), Gershuni implemented an activity of signing with his body. He is photographed dressed in an Israeli army uniform, crawling over a dune in two opposing directions that are combined with one another. In this way, a kind of sign, in the form of an X was formed. This activity was described in retrospect by Ilana Tannenbaum as an act of ars poetica, which voids and cancels out the action it performs, at the same time as it makes an ironic statement about the Israeli military.Ilana Tannenbaum, \\"The Israeli Connection: Between the Private Entity and the National Entity\\", ZERO video written in light, live broadcast, The Projected Image ‚Äì The First Decade. (Haifa: Haifa Museum of Art, 2006), 51. [Hebrew] Another work that was shown on the program included the covering up or sealing of the television screen \\"from the inside\\" with black paint. Another series of works, also from 1970, is a series of drawings on fragments of paper, with names like \\"The Paper Looks White, but Inside, Within, It Is Black.\\" In these works Gershuni emphasizes the edges of the paper by tearing it or blackening it. These actions, according to Gershuni, were intended to show \\"that paper has thickness, that it is three-dimensional.\\"Moshe Gershuni, \\"Two Meetings With Moshe Gershuni,\\" Studio 76 (October‚ÄìNovember 1996): 63. [Hebrew] By pointing out the interior dimension of the paper, Gershuni was trying to indicate ‚Äì ironically ‚Äì the \\"beyond,\\" that is the transcendental dimension of art. In the group of works that Gershuni created during the first half of the decade, content that diverged from questions of the characteristics of pure artistic representation began to appear. At the same time, Gershuni preserved the characteristics of form within conceptual art, that is, its arrangement in series, the use of text, and the reflexive dimension of the works. Among the new characteristics that appeared in his works was a whole series of clearly biographical references, both to the artist and to his family. In his work \\"My Father My Grandfather\\" (1970), for example, which was displayed in the exhibition entitled \\"Concept Plus Information\\" at the Israel Museum (Yona Fischer, Curator) in 1971, Gershuni hung an enlarged family photograph with a circle drawn around the head of his paternal grandfather. Next to the photograph was a caption that read, \\"My Old Man, Moshe the Son of So-and-So, Woodcarver. Plotzk, Poland, 1910.\\" In the 1974 \\"Benedictus\\" exhibition at the Yodfat Gallery in Tel Aviv, another work that made use of family photographs was exhibited. Under three photographs of his father and Red Army insignia, Gershuni attached a text printed on paper which said \\"My father was born in Poland and studied agriculture in France. He made aliyah to the Land of Israel in 1929. Planted trees.\\" The relationship between the images and the written texts were created, according to the later interpretation of Gideon Ofrat, pointed towards a disconnect between space and time, and between the Europe in which his grandfather lived and the Land of Israel in which Gershuni lived.See: Gideon Ofrat, \\"Gershuni in Gray,\\" Studio 40 (January 1993): 22-23. [Hebrew] The gap between the past and the present appears once again in his installation \\"Cypresses/Memories\\" (1971), which was displayed in The Artists House Tel Aviv, and which showed photographs from his childhood arranged on cut-down cypresses. The series of photographs entitled \\"The Main (Real) Problems are with the Tongue and the Toes\\" (1972) reveals Gershuni's interest in the body and corporeality as a topic of knowledge. In these self-portraits, Gershuni creates portraits by \\"mugging\\" in front of the camera, in a way that is parallel to contemporary American artists, such as Bruce Nauman, Vito Acconci, etc. The photographs of his face focus on Gershuni's mouth and focus on the relationship between the surface and the gaping space. In the photographs of his legs, Gershuni continues with an examination of the relationship by exposing the toes of his feet through yellow paper. =\\"The Problem of Painting is The Palestinian Problem\\"= Following the lead of Yitzhak Danziger, the spiritual father of many young artists of the 1970s, Gershuni participated in several performance art installations, which were called in those days \\"activities.\\" \\"You could say we were 'Danziger's Boys',\\" Gershuni related, \\"in the early 1970s, during the period when he was working in the Nesher quarry and was carrying out all of his experiments. That was during the time when he hung the wheat in the Museum, all that experimental direction that was exactly in the spirit of what we were looking for.\\"[11] These activities, that were political and social in nature, Gershuni developed in a kind of group that worked in the Hadera area, and which included Micha Ullman, Avital Geva, and Yehezkel Yardeni. The group made sure they had regular meetings with Danziger in Haifa and Tel Aviv and participated in tours he organized. Among the group of projects the group carried out, called the \\"Metzer-Messer Project\\" (1972), Gershuni took photographs of the landscapes of Kibbutz Metzer, called \\"a meeting of the kibbutz members\\", and \\"gave away\\" the kibbutz lands to these members. His colleague, the artist Micha Ullman, carried out an exchange of land between the Arab village of Messer and the neighboring kibbutz, and Geva organized books that were sent to recycling to Amnir Recycling Industries and set up an improvised libraries, among other things. The social dimension of these activities emphasized the work methods of art as an element in social progress. \\"In those days I used to say I didn't need a studio because I created products.\\"Moshe Gershuni, \\"Danziger in Gershuni's Eyes\\", Studio 76 (October‚ÄìNovember 1996): 19. [Hebrew] In 1972 Gershuni began to teach in the Department of Fine Arts of \\"Bezalel.\\" He was considered one of the central teachers, who supported experimental and political art. The \\"political discourse\\" of that period, according to Itamar Levy, \\"ran parallel to the formalist discourse.\\"See: Itamar Levy, \\"Memories of the Seventies\\", Studio 40 (January 1993): 12. [Hebrew] An example of the political involvement can be found in a 1974 manifesto which includes artistic declarations, such as combining different artistic disciplines and putting an emphasis on work processes, along with a political petition from Bezalel's teachers and pupils, including Gershuni, which called for the formation of an investigative committee to examine the government's \\"failure\\" in the Yom Kippur War.See: \\"Department of Art ‚Äì Bezalel,\\" Studio (September 1994), unnumbered. [Hebrew] In 1977, in connection with the \\"academization\\" of Bezalel, events reached a peak which included a series of strikes by the department and the students. Among the activities that Gershuni carried out with his pupils during this period was writing inscriptions that read \\"The painting problem is the Palestinian problem\\" and spreading them around the streets of Jerusalem. Because of the \\"rebellion\\" half of the teachers in the department were fired, among them Gershuni and Micha Ullman, who were considered the principal supporters of the students.Ruth Direktor, \\"Students' Revolt at the Bezalel Academy of Art 1977-1978\\" (March 1978). [Hebrew] In 1978 Gershuni began to teach at HaMidrasha - The Art Teachers Training College in Ramat Hasharon, where he continued to teach until 1986. In 1978 Gershuni exhibited his work in a large group exhibition called \\"Artist-Society-Artist\\" at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art. The version of his work \\"A Gentle Hand\\" that he displayed there included a newspaper article called \\"The Story of Joseph Ziad as Told to Leroy Frizen\\", describing abuse of a Palestinian doctor at the hands of Israeli soldiers, and including a voice recording on which he sings the song \\"A gentle hand\\" by Zalman Shneur, that was broadcast from a loudspeaker on the roof of the museum like a muezzin. In the catalog, Gershuni gave an explanation of the work that dealt both with internal politics and his own personal feelings: \\"If I say that the song is 50 years old and that its source is from a certain period of settlement and a certain period of Zionism, will that mean anything? The song has emotional significance for me. The melody has Eastern motifs. I sing it the way I remember Ilka Raveh singing it in a night club in Jaffa, and he sang the way they once used to sing, during the time of enthusiasm for things Eastern, when they were still trying to be influenced by the East. On the soundtrack that appears here it's as though I'm sitting there and teaching myself how I ought to sing \\"A Gentle Hand.\\"Irit Segoli, \\"My Red is Your Precious Blood\\" Studio 76 (October‚ÄìNovember 1996) :38-39. [Hebrew] Red Sealing, 1979‚Äì80 In 1979 a solo exhibition entitled \\"Little Red Sealings\\" opened at the \\"Sarah Levy Gallery.\\" The exhibition included paper and photographs that had been treated with red paint, a color which was to become significant in Moshe Gershuni's work in the coming years. The works exhibited a number of artistic influences by citing the names of artists such as the Italian sculptor Medardo Rosso, the Israeli painter Aviva Uri, etc. A group of his works included imagery taken from iconic art works. In an untitled work (1980) Gershuni stained a portrait of the Pope in red. In addition Gershuni added many-legged graphic symbols that were reminiscent of swastikas. This symbol appears several times, including on the groin of the Pope. In another untitled work from the same year Gershuni drew on a reproduction of a portrait of Bernard Van Orley (1521) by Albrecht D√ºrer.[16] Gershuni covered the face with transparent blue paint, like a kind of veil, and he drew on the lapel of his black garment a Star of David the edges of which were stained in red. Itamar Levy described in retrospect Moshe Gershuni's act of creating that painting as a test of his relationship to painting. \\"In Gershuni's treatment the portrait turns into dirt, the dirt is makeup, the makeup is makeup in blood. In Gershuni's treatment, the painting turns into the arena for an enraged attack on the painting. And the world that surrounds the man becomes a woman adorned, an object of lust, perhaps of forbidden passion.Itamar Levy, Moshe Gershuni: Works 1987-1990 (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1990), unnumbered. [Hebrew] Along with these personal works, Gershuni created works that had a direct social and political message. In a series of works entitled \\"Arik Sharon and the Indians\\" (1979), Gershuni made use of a pickup truck with a man holding a rifle sitting on it. Gershuni imposed red markings on them and a hand-written caption with the name of the work. In his work \\"Golda Meir\\" (1979) Gershuni wrote the name of Prime Minister Golda Meir on a portrait of the queen from the painting by Francisco Goya, \\"Charles IV of Spain and His Family\\" and gave the painting a red frame made up of paint smudges. In other works of this period Gershuni colored the edges of the paper with red paint, staining them and adding texts like \\"Hello, Soldier\\" or \\"I'm coming.\\" His works of this period were a series of installations that distanced themselves from the serious nature of his earlier works. In 1979 Gershuni exhibited the caption \\"Who's Zionist and Who Isn't?\\" on the walls of the Julie M. Gallery in Tel Aviv. In this exhibition large letters were written on the walls of the gallery in pastel chalks and lit up with strong, hot lighting. In 1980 Gershuni exhibited an installation called \\"Blood of My Heart\\" in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art. The installation included 150 white porcelain plates stained with red paint. Gershuni continued in this artistic vein in an installation called \\"Red Sealing/Theater\\" which was displayed in the Israeli Pavilion in the 1979 Venice Biennale. In this year Gershuni carried out an activity involving the sealing of the cracks in the space of the pavilion with red paint and then added objects connected to his own biography. This act of sealing in his work, in Gershuni's eyes, was meant to be interpreted as a sign of the reverberating presence of a burden that could not be eliminated.Yair Talmor, \\"The Culture That's Galloping Forward, and We Along With It: An Interview With Moshe Gershuni,\\" GoGay (July 11, 2005). [Hebrew] In the end, Gershuni presented the work \\"as a murder scene.\\"Moshe Gershuni, \\"Two Meetings With Moshe Gershuni,\\" Studio 76 (October‚ÄìNovember 1996): 63. [Hebrew] Amnon Barzel, curator of the exhibition, described the work as a transcendental description contrasting the activity of nature to the activity of man. However, a quote from Gershuni explains it as a cry against the injustice of the world: \\"I am calling my work 'Theater',\\" Gershuni wrote, \\"because of my doubt that a work of art, or the color red, can call sufficient attention to life or react to it sufficiently [...] The cry of the individual is the only justification for society, and works of art are the only excuse for continuing to live in injustice and wars.\\"Moshe Gershuni, in: Amnon Barzel (Curator), Israel: the 1980 Venice Biennale (Jerusalem: Ministry of Education and Culture, 1980). [Hebrew] These works presented a variety of new images, and therefore a conspicuous Iconographic development, in Gershuni's work. Furthermore, they abandoned the minimalist character of his works up until this time. At the end of this decade Gershuni went through a depression and a deep identity crisis. It was during this period that Gershuni also came to terms with his homosexuality. In 1981, after several sexual experiments with men, Gershuni left his family and Ra'anana for an apartment and studio on Yosef ha-Nasi Street in Tel Aviv-Yafo.See: Eli Armon Azoulay, \\"Tales of Moshe,\\" Achbar Hair [The City Mouse] (July 17, 2009). [Hebrew] It was during this period also that he met Yitzhak, his partner until the mid-1990s. \\"Soldiers in a Cabaret, 1980‚Äì82 In the beginning of the 1980s Gershuni abandoned \\"Post-minimalist\\" sculpture and the conceptual approach in order to create a series of paintings. Gershuni received encouragement for the continuation of his creative life within the framework of psychological therapy he was receiving during this period. In his first works from this period paint stains appeared in red or glittering purple, with blurry outlines, produced with glass paints on glossy paper. Next to the stains appeared short titles, such as \\"How Are You, Soldier\\" (1980). After the first works, this series of works shows a growing sophistication of graphic composition. In works like \\"Hey, Soldier\\" (1980), an abstract image in yellow and muddy gray, stained with shiny red paint, floating above the glossy paper which repels the paint. In \\"But Where is the Lamb for a Burnt Offering\\" (1980), the paint stains have turned into a schematic image of an animal placed within a framework of fiery red paint stains. Until 1981, his paintings included more identifiable images, with a specific iconography. Among the images are masculine figures in which \\"feminine\\" traits, such as exaggerated lips, appear. Other images are flags, mainly in yellow and green, and bonfires with smoking torches. The iconography of this image is connected to The Sacrifice of Isaac and the ritual sacrifice it symbolizes. he specific mention of the name Yitzhak [Isaac in English] relates also to biographical details from Gershuni's own life, to the Yitzhak who was his lover at the time or Yitzhak Danziger, who was a sort of spiritual father to him. These paintings were done by spreading on paint with his fingers while lying on the floor next to the canvas. In many of the paintings there began to appear quotes from Israeli songs and poetic verses from the Bible, which Gershuni indicated he had sung while painting these works. The development of this style was influenced by the \\"Bad Painting\\" style which developed in Europe and America during this period. The first exhibition of these works took place in the Givon Art Gallery in Tel Aviv and was called \\"Hey, Soldier.\\" Among the works included in the exhibition were paintings entitled \\"Soldier! Soldier!\\" (1981) and \\"Sing Soldier\\" (1981). In December 1981, in the third number of the journal Kav, an article by Sarah Breitberg-Semel was published. It was called \\"Moshe Gershuni -- Soldiers in a Cabaret,\\" and it discussed Gershuni's new group of works. A central place in the article was given to \\"I am a Soldier\\" (1981), which was part of this exhibition. Breitberg-Semel claimed that Gershuni's creative process was modeled by how the viewer perceived him. On one hand, the works include texts that are \\"confessions,\\" as in \\"I am a Soldier\\" or \\"I am Vincent,\\" while on the other hand the work displays the emphasis on the craftsmanship involved in the artistic expression represented by the use of glossy paint on paper that does not absorb the paint. For Breitberg-Semel, the change in the nature of the texts in Gershuni's work‚Äîfrom canonical texts related to \\"the beautiful, socialist Land of Israel\\" to texts praising the exalted nature of Creation along with \\"passages of mourning concerned with death\\" ‚Äì were a sign of a collapse of the view of one world view, militaristic and solid, and its replacement by \\"a complex point of view, open and lacking a solution, of existential questions, accompanied by mystical yearnings.\\"See: Sarah Breitberg-Semel, \\"Soldiers in a Cabaret,\\" Kav 3 (December 1981): 17-21. [Hebrew] On the cover of the fourth issue of the 1982 volume of Kav (November 1982) was a reproduction of Gershuni's painting \\"Isaac, Isaac, With Great Pity I have Loved You\\" (1982). Inside the issue appears a short text by gershuni discussing the importance of the \\"place\\" and strengthening Breitberg-Semel's interpretation. \\"I am a Jew,\\" Gershuni wrote, \\"yes, with all the mysticism that goes along with it. I am Israeli because I am a Jew. Otherwise I have no particular reason to be here.\\" Gershuni continued by describing his activity as an artist as \\"a lone soldier in the battle for the character of Israeli society.\\"See: Kav 4 (November 1982): 18. [Hebrew] Breitberg-Semel's article determined the dominant view of Gershuni's work during the 1980s. While this interpretation emphasized the corporeality and the sensuality of the way he painted, Gershuni's battle as a \\"lone soldier\\" was perceived in terms of nationalism.See: Itamar Levy, Moshe Gershuni: Works 1987-1990 (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1990), unnumbered. [Hebrew] To a certain extent the homosexual aspect of his work was covered up. \\"During the 1980s, even drawing a soldier with an earring was unthinkable,\\" Gershuni said in a later interview, but the covering up of the homosexual aspect was at the request of Gershuni himself, who preferred that the press did not openly publicize that he had come out of the closet due to family considerations.See: \\"Two Meetings With Moshe Gershuni,\\" Studio 76 (October‚ÄìNovember 1996): 73. [Hebrew] \\"A Spring Day Will Come and Cyclamen Will Bloom, 1982‚Äì89\\" Pintings from the 1980s, View at \\"Moshe Gershuni. No Father No Mother\\" (2014) exhibition at the Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin, Germany In 1982-1983 Gershuni began a series of paintings that included images of the flower cyclamen. The cyclamen, according to Gershuni, represents a national motif and often appears in Hebrew poems for children. Another iconographic source is Haim Gouri's song \\"Bab al-Wad\\" (1948). In \\"Little Isaac, Where are You Going?\\" (1982), for example, on the left side of the painting there is a dark-colored scribble that looks like flower petals next to a branched system of lines, in pencil and in paint, creating images that look like a fire, like a question mark, etc. In 1983 the cyclamen can be discerned as a clear image, but the range of colors becomes darker. In addition, Gershuni begins to include in his works symbols of alienation and exile ‚Äì \\"Yitzhak\\" (Isaac) becomes \\"Yitzhakeleh\\" and swastikas begin to appear. In 1984 Gershuni created the series \\"Hai Cyclamens,\\" (18 Cyclamens) which was exhibited in the Givon Gallery in 1984. The series is composed of 18 paintings, each of which is spread over 2 sheets of paper held together by tape, making them 140 X 200 cm total in size. Besides the images of flower petals and cyclamen petals, which form a thick, upward-pointing tangle, quotations from Gouri's song also appear in the paintings and a number of verses from Psalms 103: \\"who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion.\\" These verses are arranged around the edges of the paintings as a sort of frame. Yigal Zalmona described the motif of the cyclamen in Gershuni's work as a replacement for the soldier. As a combination of voluptuousness and a reference to national mourning. The cyclamens, Zalmona states, \\"are sometimes humanized: their leaves remind one of bodily forms, sexual organs, and buttocks, in celebratory or medical postures, sometimes withered, sometimes lushly blooming ‚Äì a reference to the conditions of the human soul.\\"Yigal Zalmona, For Man and Beast are Creatures of Chance (Jerusalem: The Israeli Museum,1986), unnumbered. [Hebrew] In addition to his expressive works, Gershuni began work on a large number of prints which he created at the Jerusalem Print Workshop. Among his works in this medium that stand out are the series of etchings called \\"Kaddish\\" (1984), each of which includes words from the Jewish prayer of mourning Kaddish, a series of prints from the poems of Hayim Nahman Bialik (1986), etc. In 1986 a large exhibition of Gershuni's paintings, curated by Zalmona, was held in the Israel Museum. The exhibition - entitled \\"For Man and Beast are Creatures of Chance\\" - displayed the major series of Gershuni's works from the time he moved into the medium of painting. Itamar Levy provided an iconographic interpretation of Gershuni's work and connected his images to artistic works from the history of western art. The meeting between these and Gershuni \\"the Jew\\" creates a space in which the old world order has awakened and \\"the aspiration toward the lofty is written in bodily fluids and systems of limbs.\\"Itamar Levy, \\"In My Milk and My Blood,\\" In: Yigal Zalmona, For Man and Beast are Creatures of Chance (Jerusalem: The Israeli Museum,1986), unnumbered. [Hebrew] In his article Zalmona also mentioned the erotic aspect of Gershuni's work and presented it as a sign of his search for self-identity. The exhibition \\"Through a Glass Darkly,\\" (1986) mounted for the first time at the Israel Museum, also exhibited Gershuni's aspirations toward the lofty. In addition to the text, the drawings display eschatological elements which were characteristic of Gershuni during this period, such as pentagrams, question marks, etc. An interesting iconographic element that appears in some of the paintings is the number \\"8.\\" The use of this figure, which appeared earlier in the paintings of Arie Aroch as a symbol for infinity, appears in Gershuni's paintings as a symbol for aspiration toward the lofty and divine love, within a chaotic and \\"earthly\\" framework. At the end of the 1980s Gershuni began once again to create works that used old porcelain ware. Works such as \\"Here I Am!!!,\\" \\"Justice Shall Walk Before Him,\\" or \\"Where Are All the Jews?\\" all of them from 1988, included textual imagery drawn from Jewish sources. Gershuni juxtaposed them to graphic images such as stars or Magen Davids (Stars of David), swastikas, and fingerprints. Kaddish, 1989‚Äì99Wreaths= In 1990 a large solo exhibition of Gershuni's works, entitled \\"Works, 1987-1990\\" and curated by Itamar Levy, was held at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art. The exhibition presented new images that had been added to Gershuni's iconography, among them, wreaths of flowers. The wreaths, which in Western culture are perceived as symbols of victory and of mourning, appeared in Gershuni's works as self-contained images floating in empty space. Alongside wreaths with abundant petals were also wreaths that were nearly bare. \\"The wreath project gradually wilted and dropped off,\\" Gershuni testified, \\"the glory faded, the wreaths became bare.\\" In one of my last I wrote \\"Come, my bride,\\" but not in the usual sense, but rather in the sense of wilting, annihilation, end.\\"Cited in: Sarah Breitberg-Semel, Gershuni (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2010), 329. [Hebrew] The wreaths appeared again as a motif in the artist's book Kaddish (1997), which was accompanied by the text of Allen Ginsberg's poem \\"Kaddish\\" (1961). The book included 24 pages, 54 x 76 centimeters in size, on which Ginsberg's text in English was printed, with a translation into Hebrew by Nathan Zach, and with prints on gold leaf. The book was displayed in 1999 in the Jewish Center in the New Synagogue, Berlin, and in 2000 in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, in exhibition cases that looked like the benches in a synagogue. On November 26, 1998, in a gallery used for artists workshops in Tel Aviv, a joint exhibition of works by Gershuni and the photographer Shosh Kormush. In the works he displayed in this exhibition Gershuni returned to the motif of wreaths, but this time he created them using a technique of obliterating the color from the surface of the painting by scratching it off with his fingernails. =Eyes= In May 1996 Gershuni held a joint exhibition with Raffi Lavie in the Givon Gallery in Tel Aviv. The exhibition was considered one of the most important exhibitions of its time, not only because it presented a body of works of two canonical figures in Israeli art, or as it was defined, of \\"local masters turning 60,\\"Sarah Breitberg-Semel, \\"The Gershuni File,\\" Studio 76 (October‚ÄìNovember 1996):24. [Hebrew] but primarily because of its relationship to Israeli public space. Gershuni's works, which included captions such as \\"El Male Rachamim\\" [God, Full of Mercy], from the \\"Kaddish\\" prayer, included images in large, dark paint stains, similar to eyes, making use of the thick impasto. The combination of these paintings with the paintings of Lavie, who for the first time used red paint stains and \\"shots\\" of color in his works, were interpreted as a direct reaction to the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, even though Gershuni's works were painted before the murder. Another indication of Gershuni's personal involvement in Rabin's murder and its implications can be seen in Aharon Shabtai's article \\"Moishe\\" (2010), in which he sets forth his political views at the time and describes his growing closeness to Leah Rabin. Aharon Shabtai, \\"Moishe,\\" In: Sarah Breitberg-Semel, Gershuni (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2010),29. [Hebrew] In addition to this Gershuni displayed works in a group exhibition called \\"After Rabin: New Works in Israeli Art\\" in 1998 at the Jewish Museum in New York City. The \\"eyes\\" motif that appears in Gershuni's works and creates a kind of basic facial form possesses a rich iconography. Along with literary references such as Hayyim Nahman Bialik's poem, \\"These hungry eyes that so earnestly seek,\\" or the poetry of Avraham Ben-Yitzhak,Sarah Breitberg-Semel, Gershuni (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2010), 339-340. [Hebrew] Gershuni testified that the eyes came from \\"there.\\" \\"Sometimes I think of the picture of my family from Poland...as the source of those eyes. I also have in my head a picture of a moving train, and from between the slats a pair of dark eyes of a little girl or little boy peeps out. The empty eyes followed me around long before I painted them, following an exhibition of Roman busts in the Louisiana Museum years ago...it was specifically the holes, the lack of eyes, that created an opening to the black emptiness within the sculpture, that pointed out that the sculpted, molded face was a thin, empty shell.Cited in: Sarah Breitberg-Semel, Gershuni (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2010), 346. [Hebrew] In Ziva Postec's film, \\"Hakhanot Lepreda\\" (Preparation for Parting) (1997: 88 minutes), documenting Gershuni's conduct during this period, Gershuni points out the connection between his personal biography and his faith. In 1997 Gershuni suffered an anxiety attack and was hospitalized in the \\"Geha\\" Mental Health Center. During his hospitalization Gershuni created an entire series of drawings he called \\"Ein Harod,\\" in which he refers to the etymology of the word \\"haredah\\" (anxiety). The drawings continued Gershuni's preoccupation with a kind of abstraction of the round form. In an interview just before the drawings went on display in a 2003 exhibition in the Museum of Art (Mishkan LeOmanut) Ein Harod named after Chaim Atar, Gershuni explained the title of the drawings and their significance: \\" I called the exhibition 'Ein Harod.' This seems to me artistically appropriate because these drawings of the landscape, a line signifying the horizon with a circle above it, are very abstract, and this name gives them concreteness and place. Ein Harod is the eye of the fear, the eye of the storm. It seems to me that this series was created from within the greatest loneliness, or the loneliest journey, that I have ever made.\\"Uri Salai, \\"Interview With Moshe Gershuni,\\" Yediot Aharonot, \\"Seven Days\\" [Supplement] (April 25, 2003); see Museum of Art, Ein Harod/Moshe Gershuni on the Museum Website. [Hebrew] This works in this series join the large group of paintings Gershuni produced from the middle of the 1990s, and they are materially minimalistic, in a way that stands out from Gershuni's previous work. The drawings, which are saturated with an atmosphere of transcendentalism, are done on canvas that Gershuni treats with different drawing materials in order to bring out the physical structure of the canvas. In 1999 Gershuni and the photographer Zohar Kaniel, his partner from 1997 until 2000, mounted an exhibit of photographs in the framework of the \\"Art Focus 3\\" exhibition. The photographs included intimate scenes of the couple in their bathroom, reflected in the mirror. The exhibition was called \\"Phaedrus,\\" from Plato's dialogue \\"Phaedrus,\\" which discusses the significance of love and the soul. Kaniel's works emphasized the reflexive dimension of the act of observation by the pair of lovers. Parallel with this, Gershuni was invited to curate an exhibition at the Israel Museum, composed of works from the Museum's collections. This exhibition also included photographs from the series that Kaniel had created. After he curated the exhibition at the Israel Museum, entitled \\"Artist's Slant ‚Äì Moshe Gershuni Selects from the Museum's Collection,\\" the Museum's curators tried to cancel the exhibition because of the provocative nature of the photographs. They also claimed that Gershuni made only minimal use of the Museum's collections, When the Museum failed to cancel Gershuni's exhibition because of an injunction Gershuni brought against it, a sign was hung at the entrance to the exhibition saying that \\"The exhibition includes a personal statement by the artist and does not express the Museum's position.\\" A detailed description of the incident appears in Studio magazine, which was the most influential art magazine in Israel at that time.See: Sarah Breitberg-Semel, \\"This is What the Museum Did to a Man It Wished to Criticize,\\" Studio 103 (June 1999): 4-7. [Hebrew] 2000s In 2000 Gershuni became romantically involved with Juan Jose Garcia Pineiro, a young Spanish man he had met on the Internet in 1999. Pineiro immigrated to Israel and began living with Gershuni in Tel Aviv. In addition, Gershuni rented a new, large studio in Southern Tel Aviv. During the first half of the decade, a number of exhibitions that recycled earlier works of Gershuni were held. In Hamidrisha Gallery the installation \\"A Gentle Hand\\" was set up again and then left there as a permanent exhibition, and in 2005 the exhibition \\"Little Red Works,\\" which had originally been mounted in the Sarah Levi Gallery in Tel Aviv in 1979, was set up again. It was curated by Benno Kalev, a collector who bought many of the works that appeared in this exhibition. After the decision was published by the Israeli Ministry of Education, Gershuni announced that he refused to shake the hand of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon or Minister of Education Limor Livnat, and that he did not intend to take part in the Israel Prize awards ceremony. \\"I am very happy to receive the Israel Prize,\\" Gershuni announced, \\"but I am very sad to receive it in the political and social conditions that exist in Israel today.\\" In a letter that he sent to the Ministry of Culture on April 4, Gershuni wrote, \\"I cannot come and take part in the ceremony awarding the prizes. This is not the time for ceremonies and parties.\\"See: Dana Gillerman, \\"Moshe Gershuni Will Boycott The Israeli Prize Ceremony,\\" Walla.co.il, and also High Court of Justice 3750/03, Moshe Gershuni vs. the Minister of Education, et.al. [Hebrew] At the same time as the storm in the press was going on, Gershuni petitioned the High Court to allow him to accept the Israel Prize without being required to attend the awards ceremony, but the High Court rejected his petition and made receiving the prize conditional on participation in the awards ceremony. In a later interview Gershuni referred to this incident and claimed that his refusal to participate in the ceremony was a result of his artistic reaction. \\"I had no choice,\\" Gershuni said, \\"I once did a work against Arik Sharon; how can I make a mockery of my art and shake his hand now? My art is more important to me than my life. It was a symbolic refusal, an expression of opposition to all the policies of this country.\\"See: Ellie Armon Azoulay, \\"Tales of Moshe,\\" Achbar ha-Ir [The Town Mouse] (July 17, 2009). [Hebrew] On March 27, 2006, at Bet Gabriel on the Sea of Galilee, the exhibition \\"Sham-Mayim,\\" curated by Gideon Ofrat, opened. In this exhibition Gershuni returned to the image of wreaths. He used watercolors and acrylic paint in shades of blue. In some of the paintings the expression \\"Field of Sacred Apples,\\" a kabbalistic expression from the liturgical poem by Isaac Luria, \\"Azmir le-Shabahim\\" (I Sing Psalms in Honor of Shabbat), chanted at the Friday night meal, appears. Ofrat described the use of the old motif of the wreaths not only as a symbol of victory and of mourning, but also as an expression of sexuality, of the desire to mate, and of Eros, all of which symbolize the attempt to reach transcendental union. On June 24, 2006 an exhibition opened at the Givon Art Gallery in which Gershuni displayed a series of paintings on fabric, done in the technique of Impasto [paint applied thickly] using oil paints and thickening gel, with a spray dripping water on the damp gel layer. These paintings, which he had begun to create at the beginning of the decade, had the look of \\"fields of paint,\\" in the style of the \\"New York School.\\" The works strove, in Gershuni's words, to be \\"a transparent screen of shadows that come from the black place.\\"Dana Gillerman, \\"I'm a Laborer in a Factory,\\" Haaretz website. In this way Gershuni sought to make the viewer look at and thus become aware of how a painting creates an artistic illusion. In the exhibition that he mounted at the Givon Art Gallery, Gershuni even directed groups of lights on the paintings in a way that created different focuses of light on the surfaces of the paintings. A similar exhibition,\\" \\"Whoever Sheds the Blood of Man in Man his Blood be Shed,\\" [An Eye for an Eye] from Pirkei Avot, took place in March 2008 in the Kfar Saba Municipal Art Gallery. At the same time Gershuni began to create a series of medium-sized bronze sculptures. These sculptures were produced using bronze casting methods from different sculptures, probably figurative, made by amateur sculptors. In 2002 Gershuni was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease. In spite of the effects of the disease, Gershuni continued with his artistic output. A series of works that aroused great interest in the press in this regard was a group of drawings called \\"Summer 2009\\" that was displayed in 2009 in the Givon Art Gallery. The exhibition displayed a large series of papers, both small and medium in size, with images of light blue patches of color. A group of these drawings was later exhibited at the Museum of Art, Ein Harod, within the framework of the Collection of Gaby and Ami Brown. 2010s In November 2010, a retrospective exhibition of Gershuni's works opened at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, curated by Sarah Breitberg-Semel. Another exhibition of his works from the 1980s onward opened in November 2014 at the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin, Germany. Gershuni died on 22 January 2017 in Tel Aviv at the age of 80. Trends in the work of Moshe Gershuni Gershuni's varied work has had a great deal of influence on Israeli art. The combination of biographical characteristics, homosexual sexual expression, and aggressive expressionism, have comprised his most noticeable examples of anti-modernism beginning in the 1970s. In the 1970s Gershuni created minimalist art, in touch with American influences. However his work, along with the strictly formal side, was concerned with the physical aspect of artistic materials. In his work of these years there is a feeling of his squeezing in under the modernist grid while emphasizing self-examination and physical examination at the same time that he is adapting new artistic techniques, such as installation art, performance art, and environmental works. \\"A great many of my works in the 1970s were connected to what was going on between us and Europe,\\" Gershuni noted with regard to his work from these years, \\"which was essentially our homeland, because we did not have a history of art of our own in Israel,...while on the other hand there is the Zionist thing...we want to be part of the East, not part of the decadence of Europe.\\"Moshe Gershuni, \\"Two Meetings With Moshe Gershuni,\\" Studio 76 (October‚ÄìNovember 1996): 66. [Hebrew] In her article, \\"\\"The Want of Matter: A Quality in Israeli Art\\" (1986), Sarah Breitberg-Semel described Gershuni's work as conducting a complex, \\"two-faced\\" dialogue with Europe and its culture. On one hand this work is saturated with the characteristics of the same culture with which, on the other hand, he conducts a blood feud in the name of the Jewish people.\\"Sarah Breitberg-Semel, The Want of Matter: A Quality in Israeli Art (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1986), and also in: Hamidrasha 2 (1999): 278. [Hebrew] In his article \\"The Visibility and Invisibility of Trauma\\" (1996),Roee Rosen, \\"The Visibility and Invisibility of Trauma,\\" Studio 76 (October‚ÄìNovember 1996): 59. [Hebrew] Roee Rosen claims that Gershuni's works during the 1980s express a paradoxical relationship to the trauma of the Holocaust. The works are full of a mixture of symbols of European culture and of Jewish culture together with symbols of sexual transgression. This mixture, Rosen says, delays the establishment of a homogeneous, hermetic identity, and allows a reflexive view of the trauma of the Holocaust.

The village is located at the mouth of the river Sokno, about south of the municipal centre of Hauge and also about southeast of the village of Rekefjord. The J√∏ssingfjorden lies about southeast of the village. The village has about 280 residents and it has become a tourist destination since the 1990s. The old village has many wooden buildings and warehouses. These buildings and the surrounding area were protected by law in 2005. Locally, the area is also known as simply Strondo. History The village grew up starting in the 1600s and by the 1660s, there was a beach resort located in Sogndalstrand. The villages of Sogndalstrand and Rekefjord are located near each other along the coast, and together they were granted rights in 1798. Together this ladested was called Sogndal (historically spelled \\"Soggendahl\\"). This status gave them a monopoly on import and export of goods and materials in the port and in the surrounding district. On 1 January 1838, all of Norway was divided up into municipalities according to the formannskapsdistrikt law. The ladested of Sogndal was put into the municipality of Sokndal. In 1845, the ladested was separated from Sokndal became a municipality of its own called Sogndal. Initially, Sogndal ladested had a population of 348 while Sokndal municipality had a population of 2,819. On 1 July 1944, Sogndal was reunited with Sokndal municipality, losing its small seaport status. Prior to the merger Sogndal had a population of 311.

Biography Ian Keith Harris was bornThe biography is based upon the preface by Jennifer Paull to 'Autumnal Interlude' published in Werner Icking Music Archive and upon biographic information provided by Ian Keith Harris. in Melbourne, living there for the first 26 years of his life. He started the piano at the age of five, was playing cornet in his school band, then violin for a couple of years at high school, and later was school pianist. in 1952, he began his Bachelor of Music degree at Melbourne University Conservatorium of Music taking piano as chief study and oboe as second. Later he changed to oboe as his chief study and studied composition with Arthur Nickson. he was soon in demand as a free-lance orchestral musician, arranger and copyist, working in a very eclectic mix of musical spheres from arranging for Eartha Kitt (television and various theatrical shows), to playing in opera, ballet, chamber music and symphony orchestras. He was a founding member of the Glendenian Trio, (flute, oboe, bassoon), which gave regular broadcasts over several years. The trio was another area in which his skills at arrangement were frequently employed. He interrupted his studies and served some years as oboist for J. C. Williamson theatres, playing musicals, opera, and several Gilbert and Sullivan Opera seasons, several ballet seasons (Borovansky Ballet), Australian tours of the Royal Covent Garden Ballet, and the American Ballet Company, and as a copyist / arranger with GTV channel 9. In 1961 Ian Harris moved to Hobart, Tasmania (Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra), was seconded to the Sydney Symphony Orchestra (cor anglais) for several months, returned to Tasmania only to be seconded again 1964, this time to the Victorian Symphony Orchestra (oboe). Back again in Tasmania, his next move was to Wellington, New Zealand (1965‚Äì1974) to join NZBCSO (the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation Symphony Orchestra) as Principal Cor anglais. During this time, in which he yo-yoed across Australasia, Harris tutored in oboe at the universities of Tasmania, Melbourne, and the Victoria University of Wellington. It was at the latter that he completed his degree in composition (with David Farquhar) in 1969. He was to return yet again to Tasmania at the end of 1974. However, this time, he embraced a new career as a music educator with his move. He also conducted the Tasmanian Junior Youth Orchestra for several years. Harris was a dedicated member of policy committees, especially in Education and the Arts and served as music critic for The Mercury, Hobart's daily newspaper, for several years. Ian Harris moved back to Sydney definitively in 2000 and has since devoted himself to composition. Works Harris destroyed most of his early compositions on completion, \\"never satisfied in their worth\\". His oeuvre consists mainly of chamber music, much of which has been performed and broadcast: Microsymphony for Cor anglais Quartet (cor anglais, string trio), Oboe Quartet (oboe, string trio), Essay for Bassoon and Strings, Sonata for Viola and Piano, amongst many other pieces and numerous arrangements for broadcasts and concerts. His sense of fun has shown in many of his compositions including, A Piece with Strawberry Jam, The Little Dog's Day (Rupert Brooke), Paw de trois, a Pas de trois for an Imaginary Canine Ballet (for Wind Quintet, with movements dedicated to his dogs by name), The Whitebait Fishers \\"A sort of Donizetti-like spoof for harpsichord, string quartet and small choir, for which the producer of the hour-long national radio show penned the libretto for this, a special anniversary broadcast of the programme.\\"composer's notes Harris orchestrated songs for symphony concerts, including a version of The Last Rose of Summer for Rita Streich (1920‚Äì1987).

In 1927, the first Delphic Festival was held in Greece, but the revival was then abandoned. Nowadays there are so-called Delphi Festivals, which are the closest to their Panhellenic counterparts. They include religious rituals and activities like poetry competition, religious offerings, sports and of course feasting.Information about the Festivals of Delphi Greece Poster of the Delphic Festival, 1927 In the second half of the 20th century, there was another attempt to restore Delphic Games. Since the 1990s, representatives from Argentina, Austria, China, Cyprus, Ecuador, France, Germany, Greece, Kazakhstan, Libya, Lithuania, Mexico, Nigeria, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, and the United States came together and organized First International Delphic Games, which took place in 2000 in Moscow, Russia (before that the concept was tested out in Tbilisi, Georgia, where First Junior Delphic Games took place.) Current revivals Currently, there are two organizations conducting Delphic Games. The International Delphic Council (IDC) with headquarters in Berlin was founded in 1994 at the Sch√∂nhausen Palace. Since 1995 the IDC actively supports the creation of the National Delphic organizations. Since 1997 the IDC has organized the International Youth Delphic Games in Georgia, Germany, Philippines, South Africa, as well as, since 2000, the International Delphic Games for adult participants in Russia, Malaysia, South Korea.Lee Kyung-min.

He was the first Chief of Defence Force of the Singapore Armed Forces from 1974‚Äì1992 and held the rank of Lieutenant-General. Early life and education Choo was given the name \\"Winston\\" by his grandfather, who named him after Winston Churchill. He grew up in Makepeace Road in the Newton area and received his education in Monk's Hill School (1947‚Äì1952) and Anglo-Chinese School (1953‚Äì1957). While he was in Anglo- Chinese School, he captained the school's football team, played hockey, and won the Queen's Badge (now the Founder's Badge) for his activities in The Boys' Brigade. Military career Choo enlisted in the Singapore Military Forces (renamed \\"Singapore Armed Forces (SAF)\\" in 1961) in December 1959 and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in December 1961 after completing his officer cadet training in Sungai Besi, Malaysia. Following that, he served as a platoon commander in the 1st Battalion Singapore Infantry Regiment (1 SIR) and was involved in two major operations. The first was when he was deployed to Sebatik Island, Borneo between 1963 and 1964 during the Konfrontasi. The second was when he led his men in patrolling the streets during the 1964 race riots in Singapore. After Singapore became independent on 9 August 1965, Choo, then the battalion signals officer, was appointed as a military aide-de-camp to Yusof bin Ishak, Singapore's first President. He was recalled to the SAF in 1966 and served as the first Commanding Officer (CO) of the 1st Signal Battalion from 1967‚Äì1968. Between 1968 and 1969, Choo attended the Long Telecommunications Course at the School of Signals in the United Kingdom, returning to Singapore to serve as the Second-in-Command (2IC) of the 1st Signal Battalion. In 1970, he was appointed as the Chief of Communications and Electronics (now known as Chief Signals Officer). In 1971, Choo served briefly as the CO of the 4th Battalion Singapore Infantry Regiment (4 SIR) before attending the Command and Staff College at Fort Canning. In the following year, he attended the US Army Command and General Staff course at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas, United States, and graduated with distinctions in all his subjects. Upon his return to Singapore in September 1972, Choo assumed command of 1 SIR. In the same year, he was named an honorary aide-de-camp to Benjamin Sheares, Singapore's second President, and took up command of the 2nd Singapore Infantry Brigade (2 SIB). He was also promoted to the rank of Colonel. He was later posted to the Defence Ministry (MINDEF)'s headquarters, where he was appointed the Head of Training and Head of Organisation and Plans in 1973. In 1974, he succeeded Kirpa Ram Vij as the Director of General Staff (renamed to \\"Chief of General Staff\\" in 1976). Choo was promoted to Brigadier (now replaced by Brigadier-General) in 1976 and to Major-General two years later. Between 1978 and 1981, Choo attended a preparatory course in military history at the Department of History of the National University of Singapore. In 1981, he went to the United States to study for a master's degree in military history at Duke University and returned to Singapore in 1982 to resume his post as the Chief of General Staff. Choo was promoted to Lieutenant-General in 1988 and became the first Chief of Defence Force (CDF) in May 1990 after \\"Chief of General Staff\\" was renamed. He retired from the SAF on 30 June 1992, after which he went to Harvard Business School and attended the six-week Advanced Management Program. Diplomatic career After retiring from military service, Choo pursued a career in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was Singapore's High Commissioner to Australia and Fiji from 1994‚Äì1997 and to South Africa from 2001‚Äì2005. He was also a non-resident High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea from 2000‚Äì2006 and to Israel since 2005. Other work Apart from his military and diplomatic careers, Choo took on non-executive roles in various governmental and non-governmental organisations, including: Deputy chairman, Central Provident Fund (1992‚Äì1994); Chairman, Chartered Industries (1992‚Äì1994); board member, Singapore Technologies (1984‚Äì1992); board member, Keppel-Tat Lee Bank (1992‚Äì2001); Board chairman, Metro Holdings (2007‚Äìpresent); Chairman, Singapore Red Cross Society (1996‚Äì2008); Member, Singapore Sports Council (late 1970s); Member, National Youth Achievement Award Council; Honorary President, Boys' Brigade (2011‚Äìpresent). Choo has contributed to several publications, including his recollections of Goh Keng Swee and of his time in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He also supported the Dads for Life movement in Singapore by contributing to the book Letters from Grandpa and Grandma (pub. 2008). Awards Throughout his career, Choo won many accolades, some of the medals were displayed at a National Library Board exhibition in 2006.

Lithuanian Grand Duke Alexander Jagiellon was preoccupied with his succession in the Kingdom of Poland and did not participate in the campaign. A harsh winter combined with burning of the steppe by Me√±li I Giray, Khan of the Crimean Khanate, resulted in famine among Sheikh Ahmed's forces. Many of his men deserted him and the remainder was defeated on the Sula River in June 1502. Sheikh Ahmed was forced into exile.

History, background and influences Italy, in particular Florence and Tuscany, was the founding nation of the Renaissance artistic, cultural and social movement which swept across Europe and revolutionized European thought and philosophy. The Renaissance ended the Middle Ages and began a period of intensive learning, cultural appreciation and thought which still influences modern politics and society (Renaissance philosophy was mainly inspired by that of Ancient Rome and Ancient Greece).Miller (2005) p.28-29 Along with this new movement, a whole new set of architectural principles were put in place, and the old Medieval and Gothic styles were neglected, and Classical designs were preferred. Cities such as Florence, and later Rome, Venice, Vicenza, Padua, Verona, Pienza, Naples, Turin, Milan and Siena began to be influenced by these new styles, often constructing elegant piazzas, beautiful palaces and re-designing some of the cluttered urban arrangements of the Middle Ages. The architectural aim of the 15th and 16th centuries was to construct an ideal city, an urban settlement which was perfectly symmetrical, proportioned, spacious, elegant, grand and beautiful. No city in Italy truly reached this state, but many, such as Florence, Vicenza, Pienza and Rome became very similar, and were geometric and planned, full of palazzi and gardens. Scientific thought was also highlighted in the Renaissance, with new scientists such as Galileo Galilei, and the first ever female doctorate, Elena Piscopia (who graduated at the University of Padua). At the same time of this period of urbanisation and artistic thought, interior design was heavily affected too, changing nearly completely from that of the Middle Ages. The sumptuous palazzi of noblemen and the middle-classes began to be decorated with tapestries, sculptures, frescos and lavish furniture. The most powerful Italian families of the time, such as the Florentine Medici, the Roman Farnese, the Milanese Sforza, the Italo-Spanish Borgia and the Urbinese Montefeltro had their palaces decorated with grand marble sculptures and beautiful paintings, representing wealth, power and prestige.  Furniture =(Marriage) Chests Cassone from the 15th century Large cassoni (singular cassone) or marriage chests, were the most desired and common features of homes, and despite the fact that they were expensive, were bought by nearly all the social classes. Made with gesso and wood, these chests were often dark and elaborate, and their grandness depended on people's different classes (wealthier people had more sumptuous ones, whilst poorer classes' chests were often far simpler). The best decorators and sculptors in Italy often produced grand and beautiful chests for some of the most important noble families of the time. Even though these chests were used to put objects inside of them, many were used simply for decoration. Chair with velvet upholstery and bone, horn, and boxwood inlay Furniture and decorative work Furniture was mainly made out of wood, often walnut or willow, and was usually rich in style, with many inlays of ivory, gold, stone, marble or other precious materials, often decorated with marquetry. Much furniture was also relatively grotesque (a French variation of the Italian word grottesco), often creating sculpted odd-looking gargoyles and monsters to make these items seem more amusing. Caryatids became popular at the time, and were made out of marble (the rich people used them as legs to their dining tables). Chairs such as the sgabello were considered symbols of wealth, and the wealthiest families had them made very sumptuous and grand. Poorer people's chairs had x-shaped backs, and some could only afford plain three- legged stools. Palladianism Andrea Palladio always designed his villas with reference to their setting. If on a hill, such as Villa Capra, facades were frequently designed to be of equal value so that occupants could have fine views in all directions. Also, in such cases, porticos were built on all sides so that occupants could fully appreciate the countryside while being protected from the sun, similar to many American-style porches of today. Palladio sometimes used a loggia as an alternative to the portico. This can most simply be described as a recessed portico, or an internal single storey room, with pierced walls that are open to the elements. Occasionally a loggia would be placed at second floor level over the top of a loggia below, creating what was known as a double loggia. Loggias were sometimes given significance in a facade by being surmounted by a pediment. Villa Godi has as its focal point a loggia rather than a portico, plus loggias terminating each end of the main building.Copplestone, p.251  Bibliography  *  References  Category:Interior design Category:Italian Renaissance Category:Italian design ","title":"Italian Renaissance interior design"},{"id":"25826558","text":"US Post Office-Herkimer is a historic post office building located at Herkimer in Herkimer County, New York, United States.

Early life Lamson was born on 8 September 1852. He was the son of Julia Wood Schuyler and Rev. William Orne Lamson (1824‚Äì1909), who married in 1850. His maternal grandfather was Robert Schuyler (1798‚Äì1855), himself the son of U.S. Representative Philip Jeremiah Schuyler, the brother of Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton and brother-in-law of Alexander Hamilton. His uncle was Robert Sands Schuyler (1830‚Äì1895), a prominent New York architect. In 1881, his father was minister of the American community's church in Florence. Career Lamson fought during the Franco-Prussian War with the French Ambulance Corps during the 1871 siege of Paris, receiving a Legion of Honour for his work. In his early career he had been a volunteer surgeon in Romania and Serbia, and decorated for his work. He returned to England, married (in 1878) and set up in medical practice in fashionable Bournemouth. Living beyond his means, and with his medical practice faring poorly, the morphine addiction he had acquired during his overseas service came to dominate his life and his financial situation grew desperate, with creditors pressing for payment of bills, cheques bouncing and his bank refusing further credit. Murder Lamson's wife (n√©e John) was one of five orphaned siblings, who were wards in Chancery and joint inheritors of a family trust fund. One of her brothers, Herbert John, died suddenly in 1879, leaving Mrs Lamson, her married sister Mrs Chapman (living in Shanklin) and her surviving brother, the youngest sibling, Percy Malcolm John. 18-year-old Percy, a hemiplegic, was boarding at Blenheim House School in Wimbledon, where he received a visit on 3 December 1881 from Lamson (allegedly before making a trip to Florence to visit his father, although in reality, Lamson was staying in London, desperately trying to raise credit, pawn possessions or borrow funds). At tea with Percy and the headmaster Mr Bedbrook, Lamson brought a rich Dundee cake, already cut into portions, which the three shared, and also gave Percy a capsule, which he persuaded the lad to swallow, from a batch that were later tested and found to contain the poison aconitine, as recorded in the case history at Old Bailey Online.Shortly after Lamson's departure, Percy was taken violently ill and died in agonised convulsions that night, raising instant suspicion of Lamson, who had departed for the continent (to Paris, in fact, not Florence). Alarmed by press reports of Percy's death and confident that the aconitine would be undetectable, Lamson voluntarily returned to London and contacted the police to clear his name, considerably surprised to find himself arrest on a murder charge and refused bail as well as the morphine to which he was heavily addicted. Scenes from the trial, wood engraving. Lamson was tried at The Old Bailey in March 1882 with Montagu Williams acting for his defence: he was found guilty of murdering Percy in order to secure his share of the family trust fund, some ¬£3,000 which Percy would have inherited on coming of age. He had poisoned his victim with aconitine in the cake, a substance which Lamson had learned about from Professor Robert Christison at Edinburgh University. Christison had taught that aconitine was undetectable, but forensic science had improved since Lamson's student days and the poison was easily identified, as well as Lamson's purchase of it from a London pharmacist.Parry & Wright (2000) p.103 Lamson's execution was delayed when U.S. President Chester Arthur, wrote to the Home Office, requesting time for Lamson's well-connected family and friends in the United States to send proof of insanity in the doctor's family and in his own life. The evidence was received but failed to secure a reprieve. Lamson was hanged by William Marwood at Wandsworth Prison on 28 April 1882, having admitted his morphine addiction and effectively his guilt of murdering Percy John.

Matrix operations The quaternions form a noncommutative ring, and therefore addition and multiplication can be defined for quaternionic matrices as for matrices over any ring. Addition. The sum of two quaternionic matrices A and B is defined in the usual way by element-wise addition: :(A+B)_{ij}=A_{ij}+B_{ij}.\\\\, Multiplication. The product of two quaternionic matrices A and B also follows the usual definition for matrix multiplication. For it to be defined, the number of columns of A must equal the number of rows of B. Then the entry in the ith row and jth column of the product is the dot product of the ith row of the first matrix with the jth column of the second matrix. Specifically: :(AB)_{ij}=\\\\sum_s A_{is}B_{sj}.\\\\, For example, for : U = \\\\begin{pmatrix} u_{11} & u_{12}\\\\ u_{21} & u_{22}\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}, \\\\quad V = \\\\begin{pmatrix} v_{11} & v_{12}\\\\ v_{21} & v_{22}\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}, the product is : UV = \\\\begin{pmatrix} u_{11}v_{11}+u_{12}v_{21} & u_{11}v_{12}+u_{12}v_{22}\\\\ u_{21}v_{11}+u_{22}v_{21} & u_{21}v_{12}+u_{22}v_{22}\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}. Since quaternionic multiplication is noncommutative, care must be taken to preserve the order of the factors when computing the product of matrices. The identity for this multiplication is, as expected, the diagonal matrix I = diag(1, 1, ... , 1). Multiplication follows the usual laws of associativity and distributivity. The trace of a matrix is defined as the sum of the diagonal elements, but in general :\\\\operatorname{trace}(AB) e\\\\operatorname{trace}(BA). Left scalar multiplication, and right scalar multiplication are defined by :(cA)_{ij}=cA_{ij}, \\\\qquad (Ac)_{ij}=A_{ij}c.\\\\, Again, since multiplication is not commutative some care must be taken in the order of the factors. Determinants There is no natural way to define a determinant for (square) quaternionic matrices so that the values of the determinant are quaternions. Complex valued determinants can be defined however. The quaternion a + bi + cj + dk can be represented as the 2√ó2 complex matrix : \\\\begin{bmatrix}~~a+bi & c+di \\\\ -c+di & a-bi \\\\end{bmatrix}. This defines a map Œ®mn from the m by n quaternionic matrices to the 2m by 2n complex matrices by replacing each entry in the quaternionic matrix by its 2 by 2 complex representation. The complex valued determinant of a square quaternionic matrix A is then defined as det(Œ®(A)). Many of the usual laws for determinants hold; in particular, an n by n matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is nonzero. Applications Quaternionic matrices are used in quantum mechanics and in the treatment of multibody problems.

It is found in Japan and, as an introduced species, in several other countries in Asia. This fish is closely related to the commonly known goldfish. Description This is a medium fish, growing up to 50 cm, with a broad head and a blunt snout. The lips are fleshy, and lacking barbels. The body is deep and laterally compressed, with a distinctly humped back. The scales are large and cycloid in shape, with a complete lateral line. Serration is present on the last ray of the dorsal and anal fins, and the caudal fin is forked. Taxonomy The Japanese white crucian carp was formerly considered a subspecies of wild goldfish, and was classified as C. auratus cuvieri. It has now been elevated to species rank, however some authors are in disagreement. Genetic studies using mitochondrial DNA indicate that this species diverged from the ancestral form approximately one million years ago, during the early Pleistocene. The original wild species unique to Lake Biwa is called . Fossil pharyngeal teeth that appear to belong to ancestral form of Japanese white crucian carp have been found in the upper part of the Katata Formation, derived from sediment layers of the former Paleo-lake Katata, on the southwest shore of Lake Biwa. Distribution and habitat Historically, the Japanese white crucian carp was endemic to Lake Biwa, as well as the connected Yodo River system, in Japan. However, it has been introduced to Taiwan and Korea. In South Korea initial introductions were the result of stocking by government agencies. Subsequently, the species has also been spread through the Buddhist practice of \\"life releasing\\", in which animals destined for slaughter are instead released into the wild. Possession of this species without a permit is prohibited in the state of Vermont. It is a freshwater fish, preferring still or slow moving waters, and occurs at depths up to 20 meters. Typical habitats include lakes, canals, and backwaters. Feeding, diet, and related information An omnivorous species, Japanese white crucian carp feed on a variety foods, including algae, phytoplankton, macrophytes, and invertebrates, such as insects and crustaceans. During the larval stage, zooplankton comprise the primary food source. Upon reaching 1.8 cm the young fish form schools and move offshore to feed on phytoplankton. Phytoplankton remains the primary food source through adulthood. This is reflected in the unique structure of their pharyngeal teeth, which are specialized to feed on phytoplankton. Reproduction Spawning occurs from April to June, and takes place in areas of aquatic vegetation, including reed beds. Some individuals will migrate into connected satellite water bodies in order to spawn. Larvae and juveniles tend to remain close to spawning areas. Importance to humans Japanese white crucian carp, as well as other crucian carp species, are the target of an established local fishing industry on Lake Biwa. It is being used as a substitute for the depleted stock of nigoro-buna in the preparation of the intense-smelling fermented local dish funazushi due to the nigoro-buna's falling numbers. A larger cultivated variant, with a taller body depth known as , was developed from the original species, cultured in the Osaka area and now released in many areas of Japan for sport fishing. It is enjoyed for catch-and-release., Also discussed in :ja:„Éò„É©„Éñ„Éä It is a major carp species in Chinese aquaculture, where it is raised for food. This species has been identified as an intermediate host of Clinostomum complanatum, a parasitic fluke capable of infecting humans. Conservation status The wild species in Lake Biwa is listed as an endangered species in the Japanese Red Data Book.Search system of Japanese Red Data Factors in its decline include water pollution, invasive species, and overfishing.

Its habitat is limited to Lake Biwa, its tributaries and distributaries, and irrigation canals, in the Shiga Prefecture (west-central Honshu), northeast of Kyoto. The fish is of culinary importance locally in Shiga Prefecture, where it is used as an ingredient for funazushi, a type of narezushi. The fermented fish is closely packed with rice and salt in tubs. Etymology The Japanese name has been ascribed various etymologies. One has it that it earned the name ni-gor≈ç-buna () meaning \\"gor≈ç-buna's look-alike\\", because once it attains sizes of approximately 1.2‚Äì1.3 shaku (‚âàfeet), it begins to look confusingly similar to the (C. cuvieri, the wild form of the Japanese crucian carp) which is a closely related species that is also endemic to the lake. It is alternatively styled nigorobuna , which crudely translates to \\"braising-timely-carp\\". Taxonomy Some literature refer to nigorobuna as subspecies Carassius auratus grandoculis,e.g., Fujioka, Y. (1997). Production and some properties of gynogenetic diploids in nigorobuna crassius carassius grandoculi, Bull. Shiga. Prefect. Fis. Exp. Stn. 46, 108, cited by Arai, Katsutoshi (2001) Genetic improvement of aqualculture finfish species by chromosome manipulation techniques in Japan\\". It is also given as subspecies Carassius buergeri grandoculis in governmental and academic literature as well as the Japanese database. The subspecies exhibits polyploidy.  Morphology  A typical adult nigorobuna attains length at maturity. Its shape resembles the that populate Lake Suwa; its body depth is short, and breadth is wide. The head is large, with a ventricular contour that is characteristically ridged. The mouth slit is slanted upwards. Around 61 (or 52‚Äì72) gill rakers can be counted, and the dorsal fin rays consist of one spine and 17 (or 15 to 18) soft rays. The anal fin has one spine and five soft rays. The basal length of the dorsal fin is rather long. The total length is 2.7√ó the body depth.  Behavior  Larvae and juveniles are found on the surface and medium depths entrenched within reeds around the lake, in other words, inlets rich in aquatic plants. Adults occupy shallower waters in summer and move to deeper waters during the cold winter. One study showed that when larvae of about 1 cm length were compared, nigorobuna was \\"scarce(ly)\\" feeding on algae, compared with local genogoro- buna, which had 25‚Äì50% algal digestive tract content by bulk. The fish showed a preference for certain water fleas over another, relying heavily on Chydorus spp. and to a lesser extent on Mesocyclops. By contrast, the gengoro-buna kept in the same enclosure preferred rotifer spp. The fry (larvae) of both species largely ignored other types of zooplankton (such as Alona, Scapholeberis, and copepodid larvae) which were plentiful., p. 124, Tables 1 As they grow into juveniles exceeding 1 cm, the nigorobuna begin pecking at aquatic plants to feed on attached algae, so by the time they attain 2 cm lengths, algae account for half their diet (and rotifers represent a small percentage)., p. 124, Tables 2 When they grow larger, they capture somewhat bottom-dwelling zooplankton. Adults spawn from April to June, laying eggs on aquatic plants when water levels rise due to the rainy season. The hatchlings live by the reedy shore, and move offshore as they grow, reaching full size in 2 to 3 years. Uses Funa-zushi made from \\"nigoro crucian carp\\": Females carrying roe (pictured) are especially prized. This is a highly prized fish commercially, made into funazushi, where whole fish are salted and fermented in beds of cooked rice. An authentic funazushi traditionally must use the \\"round crucian carp\\", and for this reason it has been dubbed sushi-buna meaning \\"the crucian carp for sushi\\". The dish, a type of narezushi, is a local delicacy of Shiga Prefecture, and known for its pungent odor. This species is said to make superior funazushi that is tender down to the bones, in contrast to imitations made by using gengoro-buna (Carassius cuvieri) as a substitute. The ginbuna (Carassius langsdorfii) is also said to be used as a substitute.  Fishing regulations  The annual catch was estimated to be 500 tons in 1965, fell to 178 tons by 1989, and drastically down to 18 tons by 1997 so that efforts were begun to release fishery-raised spawn into nearby rice paddies connected with the water system. Nowadays, the species is also farmed in Saitama Prefecture., p.40 Shiga Prefecture, in its announced project to recover the fish stock, promulgated rules through its Lake Biwa Fisheries Management Commission, effective April 1, 2007, prohibiting the capture of fish measuring 22 cm or less.  Vulnerability  The Japanese Ministry of the Environment's published Red List (2018) listed the fish subspecies as endangered (IB). The devastation of numbers is blamed on habitat loss (spawning ground), as well predation by introduced species. Adults are known to be taken by black bass, and the larvae and eggs are fed on by bluegill, both of which have become invasive in the Lake. The impact of predatory fish may be a secondary aggravating factor, the core cause being man-made changes to the lake's landscape according to some opinion. The nigorobuna's spawning grounds are the reed belts in Lake Biwa and the lagoons attached to the lake referred to as , as well as rice paddies. Most of the reed belt zones were altered by the lake shore dykes project (1976‚Äì1991), the number of lagoons fell to just over twenty, and by 1995 the total lagoon area was (15% of the total size in 1940). Also the canals connecting the bodies of water were fitted with sluice gates, hampering the fish from traveling. The current situation is not well-described as blockage by gates; the (hoj≈ç- seibi) project was conducted that raised the ground of the rice paddies, and instead of drawing water from canals, these farms switched to pumping water via PVC pipes, depriving the aquatic life of their conduits to enter..

It was founded on 28 September 1920 to act as a brotherhood for veterans of the battles of the Ypres Salient, to remember those who died there, and to aid pilgrims traveling to the battlefields. It later became an incorporated society, based in London.The Ypres League, Aftermath - when the boys came home, accessed 16/01/2010 It produced a quarterly newsletter and a guide book to Ypres, and provided a variety of services to its members, including specially designed membership certificates. It also worked to successfully erect a memorial church at Ypres. International branches were established, and the League celebrated its tenth anniversary in 1930. Publication of its newsletter continued well into the 1930s, and branches were still active in the 1940s.Legion Log, The Montreal Gazette - 4 September 1947, page 6 Founding members The founder of the League was a Canadian Ypres veteran, Colonel Beckles Willson.Warders of the Gate, Poverty Bay Herald, Volume XLVII, Issue 15387, 4 December 1920, Page 8 By December 1920, King George V had agreed to become the League's patron.Bells of Ypres for Heroic Dead, The Sydney Morning Herald - 31 Dec 1920, page 11 By 1925, there were three patrons: the King, Edward, Prince of Wales and Princess Beatrice. Beatrice, the youngest daughter of Queen Victoria, was herself a mother bereaved by the fighting at Ypres, as her son, Prince Maurice of Battenberg, had been killed in action in 1914 during the First Battle of Ypres.Casualty Details for Battenburg, Prince Maurice Victor Donald, Commonwealth War Graves Commission Debt of Honour Register, accessed 16/01/2010 The League's President, the Earl of Ypres, had been the first commander of the British Expeditionary Force during the war, and presided over one of the League's first committee meetings.Ypres survivors asked to report, Ottawa Citizen, 25 November 1920, page 2 Other officials of the League in 1925 included several who had been generals during the war: Earl Haig, Viscount Allenby, Lord Plumer, and Sir William Pulteney Pulteney. The committee also included Viscount Burnham as a representative of the Anglo-Belgian Union. Memorials and commemoration Over a quarter of a million men from British and Dominion forces died in the Ypres battles, and one of the League's primary objectives was to establish a lasting memorial to those who fought in the area. In 1924 the League proposed the erection of a memorial church at Ypres. Fundraising by the League led to the building of Saint George's Memorial Church, Ypres, consecrated in 1929.St. George's Memorial Church, Ypres , World War One Battlefields, accessed 16/01/2010 Other memorials established or contributed to by the League included the Demarcation Stones, a line of 118 red granite pylons marking the line of the Western Front. The League paid for seven of these markers to be erected in the Ypres area. The League also held annual commemorations on 31 October, known as Ypres Day, a date chosen to mark the turning point in the First Battle of Ypres in 1914. One of the early commemorations of Ypres Day, on 31 October 1921, saw a group of 800 pilgrims organised by the League travelling to Ypres.Current Topics, The Sydney Mail - 18 October 1922, page 4 The tenth anniversary of the League was marked in 1930 by a parade that included Princess Beatrice laying a wreath at the Cenotaph.untitled, Reading Eagle, 9 December 1930, page 10 The wreath-laying at the Cenotaph by Princess Beatrice was repeated in 1935 to mark the League's 15th anniversary.Beatrice Lays Wreath, Getty Images, image number 3294671, from the Hulton Archive, accessed 16/01/2010 Publications and services The League's publications included a quarterly newsletter, The Ypres Times (first published in October 1921, and still being published as late as 1938),The Ypres Times should not be confused with the trench newsletter, The Wipers Times. and books such as The Immortal Salient (1925), a historical record of the battles and a guide for pilgrims to Ypres. An account of the horror of the conditions on the Ypres Salient, written by the war correspondent Philip Gibbs, was used for the League's information leaflets. Planned publications included the Ypres Book of Valour. The League also had a marching song, called Tramping along to a little tin whistle and an old toy drum, a version of which was published in 1926.Tramping Along, catalogue entry from the National Library of Australia, accessed 16/01/2010 Other services offered by the League included framed certificates of membership for veterans of the conflict and bereaved relatives of the dead. The scroll certificates, designed by Bernard Partridge, were intended as a memorial of honour. The League, together with the St Barnabas Society, also established and maintained a Pilgrimage Centre and rest room at Ypres, and raised funds to help bereaved and impoverished relatives of dead soldiers to visit Ypres and the surrounding battlefields. The League also worked with the Imperial War Graves Commission to compile registers of those buried or lost in the Salient, and to establish historical records and information for pilgrims and its members. Membership of the League was offered on either a life or annual basis, with reduced and junior fees also available. International branches In the early 1920s, the news of the founding of the League, and the intention to establish branches overseas, appeared in newspapers in Dominion countries whose forces had served in the Salient, including Australia, New ZealandYpres Heroes, Poverty Bay Herald, Volume XLVII, Issue 15314, 9 September 1920, Page 3 and Canada.Propose to form Canadian Branch of Ypres League, Ottawa Citizen, 27 September 1920, page 1 This led to the founding of several international branches of the League, but the US branch would not be established until a decade later.
