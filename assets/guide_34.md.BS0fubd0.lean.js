Two opposition-controlled areas in the suburbs around Damascus were struck by rockets containing the chemical agent sarin. Estimates of the death toll range from at least 281 people to 1,729. The attack was the deadliest use of chemical weapons since the Iran–Iraq War. Inspectors from the United Nations Mission already in Syria to investigate an earlier alleged chemical weapons attack requested access to sites in Ghouta the day after the attack and called for a ceasefire to allow inspectors to visit the Ghouta sites. The Syrian Ba'athist government granted the UN's request on 25 August, and inspectors visited and investigated Moadamiyah in Western Ghouta the next day and Zamalka and Ein Tarma in Eastern Ghouta on 28 and 29 August. The UN investigation team confirmed \\"clear and convincing evidence\\" of the use of sarin delivered by surface-to-surface rockets, Also: and a 2014 report by the UN Human Rights Council found that \\"significant quantities of sarin were used in a well-planned indiscriminate attack targeting civilian-inhabited areas, causing mass casualties. The evidence available concerning the nature, quality and quantity of the agents used on 21 August indicated that the perpetrators likely had access to the chemical weapons stockpile of the Syrian military, as well as the expertise and equipment necessary to safely manipulate large amount of chemical agents.\\" It also stated that the chemical agents used in the Khan al-Assal chemical attack earlier in 2013 \\"bore the same unique hallmarks as those used in Al- Ghouta\\". The Syrian opposition as well as many governments, the Arab League and the European Union stated the attack was carried out by forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The Syrian and Russian governments blamed the opposition for the attack, the Russian government calling the attack a false flag operation by the opposition to draw foreign powers into the civil war on the rebels' side. Åke Sellström, the leader of the UN Mission, characterized government explanations of rebel chemical weapons acquisition as unconvincing, resting in part upon \\"poor theories\\". Several countries including France, the United Kingdom and the United States debated whether to intervene militarily against Syrian Ba'athist government forces. On 6 September 2013, the United States Senate filed a resolution to authorize use of military force against the Syrian military in response to the Ghouta attack. On 10 September 2013, the military intervention was averted when the Syrian government accepted a US–Russian negotiated deal to turn over \\"every single bit\\" of its chemical weapons stockpiles for destruction and declared its intention to join the Chemical Weapons Convention. In June 2018 the OPCW noted with concern that the Syrian Arab Republic had in reality neither declared nor destroyed all of its chemical weapons and chemical weapons production facilities. Background The Ghouta area is composed of densely populated suburbs to the east and south of Damascus, part of the province of Rif Dimashq. Ghouta is a primarily conservative Sunni region. Since early in the civil war, civilians in rebel- held Eastern Ghouta have almost entirely sided with the opposition to Syria's government. The opposition has controlled much of Eastern Ghouta since 2012, partly cutting off Damascus from the countryside. Muadamiyat al-Sham in Western Ghouta had been under government siege since April 2013. Ghouta had been the scene of continuing clashes for more than a year before the chemical attack, with government forces launching repeated missile assaults trying to dislodge the rebels. The week of the attack, the Syrian government launched an offensive to capture opposition-held Damascus suburbs. The attack came one year and one day after US President Barack Obama's 20 August 2012 \\"red line\\" remarks, in which he warned: \\"We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus. That would change my equation.\\" Syria was one of five non- signatories to the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention at the time. After the \\"red line\\" remarks, and before the chemical attack in Ghouta, chemical weapons were suspected to have been used in four attacks in the country. =Khan al- Assal chemical attack= The Khan al-Assal chemical attack occurred on 19 March 2013, when a government-controlled area of Khan al-Asal, a district of Aleppo in northern Syria, was struck by a rocket containing the nerve agent sarin. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights the attack resulted in at least 26 fatalities, including 16 government soldiers and 10 civilians. The Syrian government later reported to the United Nations that one soldier and 19 civilians died and that 17 soldiers and 107 civilians were injured. A medic at the local civilian hospital said he personally had witnessed Syrian army soldiers helping the wounded and dealing with fatalities at the scene. The sarin used in the Khan al-Assal attack \\"bore the same unique hallmarks\\" as the sarin used in the Ghouta attack. =Independent International Commission of Inquiry= The United Nations Human Rights Council established the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic on 22 August 2011 to investigate human rights violations during the Syrian civil war. One of the topics the commission investigated was possible use of chemical weapons. In early June 2013, the Fifth Report of the Commission of Inquiry stated that there were reasonable grounds to believe that toxic chemicals were used in four attacks, but more evidence was needed \\"to determine the precise chemical agents used, their delivery systems or the perpetrator.\\" Final version dated 18 July 2013 found on this page. A/HRC/23/58 On 22 June, the head of the Commission of Inquiry, Paulo Pinheiro, said the UN could not determine who used chemical weapons in Syria based on evidence sent by the United States, Britain and France. =Assessments prior to the attack= US assessment US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel stated on 25 April that US intelligence showed the Assad government had likely used sarin on a small scale. However, the White House announced that \\"much more\\" work had to be done to verify the intelligence assessments. On 13 June 2013, the United States government publicly announced it had concluded that the Assad government had used limited amounts of chemical weapons on multiple occasions against rebel forces, killing 100 to 150 people. US officials stated that sarin was the agent used. Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes did not say whether this showed that Syria had crossed the \\"red line\\" established by President Obama in August 2012. Rhodes stated: \\"The president has said that the use of chemical weapons would change his calculus, and it has.\\" The French government announced that its own tests confirmed US assertions. Russian assessment Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said \\"the accusations of Damascus using chemical weapons put forth by the United States are not backed by credible facts.\\" Lavrov further stated that the Syrian government had no motive to use chemical weapons since the government already maintained a military advantage over the rebel fighters. Attacks The attacks affected two separate opposition-controlled districts in the Damascus suburbs, located 16 kilometres apart. Web version =Eastern Ghouta attack= The first attack took place around 2:30 a.m. on 21 August 2013 in Eastern Ghouta, a rebel-held suburb to the east of Damascus. The area was on a rebel weapons supply route from Jordan and had been under siege by the Syrian military and Hezbollah for months. At least 8, and possibly 12, rockets struck within a 1500 by 500-meter area in the Zamalka and nearby Ein Tarma neighborhoods. The rockets were all of the same improvised type, each with an estimated capacity to carry of sarin. The rocket engine was similar in type and parameters to a 122 mm GRAD unguided surface-to-surface rocket, while the chemical warhead and the stabilization fin was of an artisan-type. HTML version One (or both) of the labs examining the environmental samples taken from Zamalka (and Ein Tarma) found at least traces of sarin in 14 of the 17 cases. One of the labs described the sarin level as a \\"high level concentration\\" in 4 of the 17 samples. =Western Ghouta attack= The second attack took place in the Western Ghouta area around 5:00 in the morning on 21 August. On 22 August, a witness who works for Moadamiya media center said he had counted seven rockets that fell in two areas of Moadamiya during the early morning of 21 August. He said four rockets hit next to the Rawda Mosque and another three in the area between Qahweh Street and Zeytouneh Street, which he said was approximately 500 meters to the east of the Rawda Mosque. He said all the rockets were of the same type. While no chemical warhead was ever found in the Western Ghouta area, one rocket engine has been identified as a 140mm M-14 unguided surface- to-surface rocket. This type of rocket can be fitted with three types of warheads: high explosive-fragmentation, white phosphorus smoke, or a chemical warhead containing of sarin. None of the 13 environmental samples taken from Western Ghouta tested positive for sarin, although three had \\"degradation and/or by-products.\\" Chemical weapons capability At the time of the attack, Syria was not a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, transfer and use of chemical weapons, although in 1968 it acceded to the 1925 Geneva Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases. In 2012 Syria publicly stated it possessed chemical and biological weapons and would use them if it faced a foreign attack. According to French intelligence, the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center (SSRC) is responsible for producing toxic agents for use in war. A group named \\"Branch 450\\" is allegedly responsible for filling munitions with chemicals and maintaining security of the chemical agent stockpiles. As of September 2013, French intelligence estimated the Syrian stockpile at 1,000 tonnes, including Yperite, VX and \\"several hundred tonnes of sarin.\\" The UK's Joint Intelligence Committee publicly dismissed the possibility of rebel responsibility for the attack in Ghouta, stating that rebels are incapable of an attack of its scale. The Committee stated that \\"there is no credible intelligence or evidence to substantiate the claims or the possession of CW by the opposition.\\" Åke Sellström, a Swedish scientist who led the UN mission to investigate the attacks, said it was difficult to see how rebels could have weaponized the toxins, but admitted that he didn't know who the perpetrator was. According to the Associated Press, \\"chemical and biological weapons experts have been relatively consistent in their analysis, saying only a military force with access to and knowledge of missile delivery systems and the sarin gas suspected in Ghouta could have carried out an attack capable of killing hundreds of people.\\" Initial claims Both the opposition and the Syrian government said a chemical attack was carried out in the suburbs around Damascus on 21 August 2013. Anti-government activists said the Syrian government was to blame for the attack, while the Syrian government said foreign fighters and their international backers were to blame. =Opposition claims= On the day of the attack, George Sabra, the head of the Syrian National Council, said 1,300 people had been killed as shells loaded with poisonous gas rained down on the capital's eastern suburbs of Douma, Jobar, Zamalka, Arbeen and Ein Tarma. A spokesman for the Free Syrian Army's Supreme Military Council, Qassim Saadeddine, said, \\"people are growing desperate as they watch another round of political statements and UN meetings without any hope of action.\\" Ahmad Jarba, who was the president of the Syrian National Coalition at the time of the attack, called on the UN investigators to travel to \\"the site of the massacre\\" and for an urgent United Nations Security Council meeting on the subject. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the attack was committed by the Syrian regime and called on Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations, \\"to apply all pressure within his powers to pressure the Syrian regime.\\" The next day, a spokesman for the Syrian National Coalition, Khaled al-Saleh, said at least six doctors died after treating victims, and that they didn't yet have the number of dead first responders. =Government claims= Syria's Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs, Qadri Jamil, said foreign fighters and their international backers were to blame for the attack. Syrian state television, SANA, said the accusations were fabricated to distract a team of UN chemical weapons experts which had arrived three days before the attacks. Syrian President Bashar al- Assad said the claims that his government had used chemical weapons would go against elementary logic and that \\"accusations of this kind are entirely political.\\" Original Russian version UN investigation On 19 March 2013, the Syrian government reported to the UN Security Council that the rebels had fired a rocket containing chemical materials into a government controlled part of Khan al-Asal, a district of Aleppo in northern Syria, and requested a UN mission to investigate it. As a response, the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon created the \\"United Nations Mission to Investigate Alleged Uses of Chemical Weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic.\\" The Syrian government first refused to allow the UN mission to be expanded to places outside Khan al-Assal, but agreed in July 2013 to also allow investigation of the alleged attack in Sheikh Maqsood on 13 April 2013 and the alleged attack in Saraqib on 29 April 2013. On 23 April 2013, the New York Times reported that the British and French governments had sent a confidential letter to the UN Secretary-General, stating there was evidence that the Syrian government had used chemical weapons in Aleppo, Homs and perhaps Damascus. Israel also claimed that the Syrian government had used chemical weapons on 19 March near Aleppo and Damascus. On 24 April, Syria blocked UN investigators from entering Syria, while UN Under-Secretary for Political Affairs Jeffrey Feltman said this would not prevent an inquiry from being carried out. On 18 August 2013, three days before the Ghouta attack, a UN mission headed by Åke Sellström arrived in Damascus with permission from the Syrian government to investigate earlier alleged chemical weapons use. On the day of the attack, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed \\"the need to investigate [the Ghouta incident as] soon as possible,\\" hoping for consent from the Syrian government. The next day, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay urged government and opposition forces to allow an investigation and Ban requested the government provide immediate access. On 23 August, clashes between rebel and government forces continued in and around Ghouta, government shelling continued and UN inspectors were denied access for a second day. White House officials were convinced that the Syrian government was trying to hide the evidence of chemical weapons use by shelling the sites and delaying their inspection. Ban called for a ceasefire to allow the inspectors to visit the attack sites. On 25 August the government and various rebel factions agreed to a ceasefire for five hours each day from 26 to 29 August. Early in the morning of 26 August several mortars hit central Damascus, including one that fell near the Four Seasons Hotel where the UN inspectors were staying. Later in the day the UN team came under sniper fire en route to Moadamiyah in western Ghouta (to the southwest of central Damascus), forcing them to return to their hotel and replace one of their vehicles before continuing their investigation four hours later.BBC, 26 August 2013, Syria crisis: UN inspectors' convoy hit by sniper fire The attack prompted a rebuke from Ban toward the fighters. After returning to Moadamiyah the UN team visited clinics and makeshift field hospitals, collected samples and conducted interviews with witnesses, survivors and doctors. The inspectors spoke with 20 victims of the attacks and took blood and hair samples, soil samples, and samples from domestic animals. As a result of the delay caused by the sniper attack, the team's time in Moadamiyah was substantially shortened, with the scheduled expiry of the daily cease-fire leaving them around 90 minutes on the ground. On 28 and 29 August the UN team visited Zamalka and Ein Tarma in Eastern Ghouta, east of central Damascus, for a total time of five-and-a-half hours. On 30 August the team visited a Syrian government military hospital in Mazzeh and collected samples. The mission left Syria early on 31 August, promising to return to complete the original objective to investigate the previously alleged attack sites. The Syrian government wanted the mission to stay and investigate them at that time. =UN Ghouta Area report= The UN report on the investigation into the Ghouta chemical attacks was published on 16 September 2013. The report stated: \\"the environmental, chemical and medical samples we have collected provide clear and convincing evidence that surface-to-surface rockets containing the nerve agent sarin were used in Ein Tarma, Moadamiyah and Zamalka in the Ghouta area of Damascus.\\" UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called the findings \\"beyond doubt and beyond the pale,\\" and clear evidence of a war crime. \\"The results are overwhelming and indisputable,\\" he said. Ban stated a majority of the blood samples, environmental samples and rockets or rocket fragments recovered tested positive for sarin. The report, which was \\"careful not to blame either side,\\" said that during the mission's work in areas under rebel control, \\"individuals arrived carrying other suspected munitions indicating that such potential evidence is being moved and possibly manipulated.\\" The UN investigators were accompanied by a rebel leader: The British UN Ambassador stated that the report's lead author, Åke Sellström, said the quality of the sarin used in the attack was higher than that used by Iraq in the Iran–Iraq War, implying a purity higher than the Iraqi chemical weapons program's low purity of 45–60%. (By comparison, Aum Shinrikyo used nearly pure sarin in the 1994 Matsumoto incident.) Responses According to Human Rights Watch, hundreds of kilograms of sarin were used in the attack, which it said suggested government responsibility, as opposition forces were not known to possess significant amounts of sarin. The Russian government dismissed the initial UN report after it was released, calling it \\"one-sided\\" and \\"distorted.\\" On 17 September, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reiterated his government's belief that the opposition carried out the attacks as a \\"provocation.\\" The United Nations High Representative for Disarmament Affairs Angela Kane said the inspection team would review Russia's objections. An August 2013 Scientific American article described difficulties that could arise when attempting to identify the manufacturer of sarin from soil or tissue samples. An Iranian chemical weapons expert, Abbas Foroutan, said in October 2013 that the UN should publish more details about the investigation than were provided in the report, including victims' pulse rates and blood pressure and their response to the atropine treatment, the victims' levels of acetylcholinesterase (sarin is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) and more technical details on the lab testing process.Foroutan's work was reviewed in Neurology in 2004 by a US Army chemical weapons expert, and described as \\"the only firsthand clinical descriptions of battlefield nerve agent casualties in the world literature\\". – Sharmine Narwani and Radwan Mortada, mideastshuffle.com, 1 October 2010, CW Expert Opinion on the UN Report on Syria =Final UN Mission report= The UN inspection team returned to Syria to continue investigations into other alleged chemical attacks in late September 2013. A final report on Ghouta and six other alleged attacks (including three alleged to have occurred after the Ghouta attack) was released in December 2013. The inspectors wrote that they \\"collected clear and convincing evidence that chemical weapons were used also against civilians, including children, on a relatively large scale in the Ghouta area of Damascus on 21 August 2013.\\" The conclusion was based on: *Impacted and exploded surface-to-surface rockets, capable to carry a chemical payload, were found to contain sarin; *Close to the rocket impact sites, in the area where patients were affected, the environment was found to be contaminated by sarin; *The epidemiology of over fifty interviews given by survivors and health care workers provided ample corroboration of the medical and scientific results; *A number of patients/survivors were clearly diagnosed as intoxicated by an organophosphorous compound; *Blood and urine samples from the same patients were found positive for sarin and sarin signatures. =UN Human Rights Council report= The 7th Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, a different group than the UN fact- finding mission, stated the sarin used in the Ghouta attack bore the \\"same unique hallmarks\\" as the sarin used in the Khan al-Assal attack. The report, dated 12 February 2014, also indicated that the perpetrators likely had access to the chemical weapons stockpile of the Syrian military. These conclusions were based on the fact-finding mission's evidence, as the Commission of Inquiry did not conduct its own investigation of either chemical attack. Aftermath The continuous fighting has severely limited the quality of medical care for injured survivors of the attack. A month after the attack, approximately 450 survivors still required medical attention for lingering symptoms such as respiratory and vision problems. By early October 2013, the 13,000 residents of Moadhamiya, one of the places targeted in the August attack, had been surrounded by pro-government forces and under siege for five months. Severe malnourishment and medical emergencies become pressing as all supply lines had stopped. Care for chronic symptoms of sarin exposure had become \\"just one among a sea of concerns.\\" As countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom debated their response to the attacks, they encountered significant popular and legislative resistance to military intervention. In particular, British Prime Minister David Cameron's request to the House of Commons to use military force was declined by a 285–272 margin. UK government policy subsequently focused on providing humanitarian assistance inside Syria and to refugees in neighboring countries. Within a month of the attacks, Syria agreed to join the Chemical Weapons Convention and allow all its stockpiles to be destroyed. The destruction began under OPCW supervision on 6 October 2013. On 23 June 2014, the last shipment of Syria's declared chemical weapons was shipped out of the country for destruction. By 18 August 2014, all toxic chemicals were destroyed aboard the US naval vessel MV Cape Ray. Nine months after the attack, there is evidence that mothers from the affected areas are giving birth to children with defects and as stillborn. Reactions =Domestic= Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi was quoted by the official state news agency, Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA), as saying that the government did not and would not use such weapons, if in fact they even existed. Al-Zoubi said, \\"everything that has been said is absurd, primitive, illogical and fabricated. What we say is what we mean: there is no use of such things (chemical weapons) at all, at least not by the Syrian army or the Syrian state, and it's easy to prove and it is not that complicated.\\" SANA called the reports of chemical attacks as \\"untrue and designed to derail the ongoing UN inquiry.\\" A Syrian military official appeared on state television denouncing the reports as \\"a desperate opposition attempt to make up for rebel defeats on the ground.\\" Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad declared it a tactic by the rebels to turn around the civil war which he said \\"they were losing\\" and that, though the government had admitted to having stocks of chemical weapons, stated they would never be used \\"inside Syria\\". Democratic Union Party leader Salih Muslim said he doubted that the Syrian government carried out the chemical attack. The National Coalition called the attack a \\"coup de grace that kills all hopes for a political solution in Syria.\\" In a statement on Facebook, the Coventry-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an anti-government activist network, blamed the attack on the Syrian military and said of the incident that \\"we assure the world that silence and inaction in the face of such gross and large-scale war crimes, committed in this instance by the Syrian regime, will only embolden the criminals to continue in this path. The international community is thus complicit in these crimes because of its [polarisation], silence and inability to work on a settlement that would lead to the end of the daily bloodshed in Syria.\\" =International= The international community condemned the attacks. United States President Barack Obama said the US military should strike targets in Syria to retaliate for the government's purported use of chemical weapons, a proposal publicly supported by French President François Hollande, but condemned by Russia and Iran. The Arab League stated it would support military action against Syria in the event of UN support, though member states Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, and Tunisia opposed it. At the end of August, the House of Commons of the United Kingdom voted against military intervention in Syria. In early September, the United States Congress began debating a proposed authorisation to use military force, although votes on the resolution were indefinitely postponed amid opposition from many legislators and tentative agreement between Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin on an alternative proposal, under which Syria would declare and surrender its chemical weapons to be destroyed under international supervision. In contrast to the positions of their governments, polls in early September indicated that most people in the US, UK, Germany and France opposed military intervention in Syria. One poll indicated that 50% of Americans could support military intervention with cruise missiles only, \\"meant to destroy military units and infrastructure that have been used to carry out chemical attacks.\\" In a survey of American military personnel, around 75% said they opposed air strikes on Syria, with 80% saying an attack would not be \\"in the U.S. national interest\\". Meanwhile, a Russian poll suggested that most Russians supported neither side in the conflict, with less than 10% saying they supported Assad. =Allegations of false flag attack= The attacks prompted some U.S. intelligence officials to speculate they were carried out by the opposition in order to draw the West into the war, a concept dismissed by others. Other experts and officials questioned whether the government was responsible based on the timing of the attack, just after the UN Mission had arrived in Damascus, and lack of motivation, since the government was advancing in the area. In December 2013 Seymour Hersh wrote that in the days before and after the attack, sensors notifying U.S. intelligence agencies of Syrian chemical weapons deployment did not activate, and intelligence briefings shown to the U.S. president contained no information about an impending government chemical weapons attack. In the article, Hersh relates that the U.S. government had publicly cited classified intercepts of communications it said were between Syrian officials, unavailable to the public, which they state prove Syrian government forces carried out the chemical attack. Hersh quotes a former senior U.S. intelligence official who said the transcript included intercepts from many months prior to the attack, collated to make them appear related to the Ghouta attacks. In April 2014 Hersh wrote an article proposing the attacks were committed by Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front, whom Hersh writes were supplied with sarin by Turkey. Hersh's argument received some support, but was dismissed by other commentators. The US and Turkish governments denied the accuracy of Hersh's article. On 20 October 2015, Republican People's Party deputy Eren Erdem told RT that documents from a Turkish government investigation showed that ISIL and affiliated groups received help from Turkish intelligence (Millî İstihbarat Teşkilatı) to carry out the Ghouta chemical attack. Evidence =Witness statements and victim symptoms= Syrian human rights lawyer Razan Zaitouneh, who was present in Eastern Ghouta, stated, \\"Hours [after the shelling], we started to visit the medical points in Ghouta to where injured were removed, and we couldn't believe our eyes. I haven't seen such death in my whole life. People were lying on the ground in hallways, on roadsides, in hundreds.\\" Several medics working in Ghouta reported the administration of large quantities of atropine, a common antidote for nerve agent toxicity, to treat victims. Doctors Without Borders said the three hospitals it supports in Eastern Ghouta reported receiving roughly 3,600 patients with \\"neurotoxic symptoms\\" over less than three hours during the early morning of 21 August. Of those, 355 died. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria claimed that of the 1,338 victims, 1,000 were in Zamalka, of which 600 bodies were transferred to medical points in other towns and 400 remained at a Zamalka medical center. Some of the fatalities were rebel fighters. The deadliness of the attack is believed to have been increased due to civilians reacting to the chemical attack as if it was typical government bombardment. For conventional artillery and rocket attacks, residents usually went to the basements of buildings, where in this case the heavier-than-air sarin sank into these below-ground, poorly ventilated areas. Some of the victims died while sleeping. Abu Omar of the Free Syrian Army told The Guardian that the rockets involved in the attack were unusual because \\"you could hear the sound of the rocket in the air but you could not hear any sound of explosion\\" and no obvious damage to buildings occurred. Human Rights Watch's witnesses reported \\"symptoms and delivery methods consistent with the use of chemical nerve agents.\\" Activists and local residents contacted by The Guardian said that \\"the remains of 20 rockets [thought to have been carrying neurotoxic gas] were found in the affected areas. Many [remained] mostly intact, suggesting that they did not detonate on impact and potentially dispersed gas before hitting the ground.\\" A child in Ghouta froths from the mouth, a medical condition \\"associated with exposure to nerve agents such as Sarin.\\" Doctors Without Borders also reported seeing a \\"large number of victims arriving with symptoms including convulsions, excessive saliva, pinpoint pupils, blurred vision and respiratory distress.\\" Symptoms reported by Ghouta residents and doctors to Human Rights Watch included \\"suffocation, muscle spasms and frothing at the mouth.\\" Witness statements to The Guardian about symptoms included \\"people who were sleeping in their homes [who] died in their beds,\\" headaches and nausea, \\"foam coming out of [victims'] mouths and noses,\\" a \\"smell something like vinegar and rotten eggs,\\" suffocation, \\"bodies [that] were turning blue,\\" a \\"smell like cooking gas\\" and redness and itching of the eyes. Richard Spencer of The Telegraph summarised witness statements, stating, \\"The poison ... may have killed hundreds, but it has left twitching, fainting, confused but compelling survivors.\\" On 22 August, the Center for Documentation of Violations in Syria published numerous testimonies. It summarised doctors' and paramedics' descriptions of the symptoms as \\"vomiting, foamy salivation, severe agitation, [pinpoint] pupils, redness of the eyes, dyspnea, neurological convulsions, respiratory and heart failure, blood out of the nose and mouth and, in some cases, hallucinations and memory loss\\". Analysis of symptoms Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior associate for the Center for Biosecurity at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said the reported symptoms are a textbook case of nerve-agent poisoning. Médecins Sans Frontières Director of Operations Bart Janssens stated that MSF \\"can neither scientifically confirm the cause of these symptoms nor establish who is responsible for the attack. However, the reported symptoms of the patients, in addition to the epidemiological pattern of the events – characterised by the massive influx of patients in a short period of time, the origin of the patients, and the contamination of medical and first aid workers – strongly indicate mass exposure to a neurotoxic agent.\\" Gwyn Winfield, editorial director at CBRNe World, analysed some videos from the day of the attack and wrote on the magazine's website: \\"It is difficult to define [an] agent by the signs and symptoms. Clearly respiratory distress, some nerve spasms and a half-hearted washdown (involving water and bare hands?!), but it could equally be a riot control agent as a [chemical warfare agent].\\" =Rockets= RPU-14 multiple rocket launcher, of a type that may have launched M-14 munitions found by UN inspectors on 26 August at a site in Moadamiyah.Joe Pappalardo, Popular Mechanics, 17 September 2013, The Story of Syria's Chemical Artillery Human Rights Watch reported that two types of rockets were used: in Western Ghouta, a 140mm rocket made in the Soviet Union in 1967 and exported to Syria; and in Eastern Ghouta, a 330mm rocket of unknown origin. HRW also reported that at the time of the attack, Syrian rebels were not known to be in possession of the rockets used. Seymour Hersh has suggested that the 330mm rockets may have been produced locally, and with a limited range. Eliot Higgins has looked at the munitions linked to the attack and analysed footage of the putative launchers inside government territory. According to analysis conducted in January 2014 by Theodore Postol and Richard Lloyd, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the rockets used in the attack had a range of about two kilometers, which, the authors claimed, meant that the munitions could not have been fired from the 'heart' or from the Eastern edge of the Syrian Government Controlled Area shown in the Intelligence Map published by the White House on 30 August 2013. A response from Higgins and Kaszeta included an observation that the Russian-language news site ANNA News had posted videos showing a Syrian government military operation running from June to August 2013 to clear positions between Jobar and Qaboun, a strip of land about 2 km away from 21 August impact sites. Many of the munitions and their fragments had been moved; however, in two cases, the UN could identify the likely launch azimuths. Triangulating rocket trajectories suggests that the origin of the attack may have been within government or rebel-held territory. Consideration of missile ranges influences calculations as to whether rockets originated from the government or rebel-held regions. =Communications= Two purported intercepts of communications that appeared to implicate the Syrian government received prominent media coverage. One was a phone call allegedly between Syrian officials which Israel's Unit 8200 was said to have intercepted and passed to the US. The other was a phone call which the German Bundesnachrichtendienst said it had intercepted, between a high-ranking representative of Hezbollah and the Iranian embassy, in which the purported Hezbollah official said that poison gas had been used and that Assad's order to attack with chemical weapons had been a \\"big mistake\\". On 29 August the Associated Press reported that, according to two U.S. intelligence officials and two other U.S. officials, the U.S. intercept was a conversation between \\"low-level\\" Syrian officials with no direct link to the upper echelons of the government or military. The Bild am Sonntag newspaper subsequently reported that German intelligence indicated that Assad had likely not ordered the attacks. According to Bild, \\"intelligence interception specialists\\" relying on communications intercepted by the German vessel Oker said that Syrian military commanders had repeatedly been asking permission to launch chemical attacks for around four months, with permission always being denied from the presidential palace. The sources concluded that 21 August attack had probably not been approved by Bashar al-Assad.Martin S. Lambeck, Kayhan Özgenc and Burkhard Uhlenbroich, Bild am Sonntag, 8 September 2013, Assad-Kommandeure wollten seit Monaten Giftgas einsetzen =Video= Murad Abu Bilal, Khaled Naddaf and other Center for Documentation of Violations in Syria and Local Coordination Committees of Syria (LCC) media staff went to Zamalka soon after the attacks to film and obtain other documentary evidence. Almost all the journalists died from inhalation of the neurotoxins, except Murad Abu Bilal, who was the only Zamalka LCC media member to survive. The videos were published on YouTube, attracting worldwide media attention. Experts who have analysed the first video said it shows the strongest evidence yet consistent with the use of a lethal toxic agent. Visible symptoms reportedly included rolling eyes, foaming at the mouth, and tremors. There was at least one image of a child suffering miosis, the pin-point pupil effect associated with the nerve agent Sarin, a powerful neurotoxin reportedly used before in Syria. Ralph Trapp, a former scientist at the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, said the footage showed what a chemical weapons attack on a civilian area would look like, and went on to note \\"This is one of the first videos I've seen from Syria where the numbers start to make sense. If you have a gas attack you would expect large numbers of people, children and adults, to be affected, particularly if it's in a built-up area.\\" Some experts, among them Jean Pascal Zanders, initially stated that evidence that sarin was used, as claimed by pro-rebel sources, was still lacking and highlighted the lack of second-hand contaminations typically associated with use of weapons-grade nerve agents: \\"I remain sceptical that it was a nerve agent like sarin. I would have expected to see more convulsions,\\" he said. \\"The other thing that seems inconsistent with sarin is that, given the footage of first responders treating victims without proper protective equipment, you would expect to see considerable secondary casualties from contamination – which does not appear to be evident.\\" However, after Zanders saw footage imminently after the attack, he changed his mind, saying: \\"The video footage and pictures this time are of a far better quality. You can clearly see the typical signs of asphyxiation, including a pinkish blueish tinge to the skin colour. There is one image of an adult woman where you can see the tell-tale blackish mark around her mouth, all of which suggests death from asphyxiation.\\" Zanders however cautioned that these symptoms covered a range of neurotoxicants, including some available for civilian use as pest control agents, and said that until the UN reported its analysis of samples, \\"I can't make a judgement. I have to keep an open mind.\\"Huffington Post, 30 August 2013, Syria: Chemical Weapons Expert Jean Pascal Zanders Says Gas Might Not Be Sarin, Urges Caution According to a report by The Daily Telegraph, \\"videos uploaded to YouTube by activists showed rows of motionless bodies and medics attending to patients apparently in the grip of seizures. In one piece of footage, a young boy appeared to be foaming at the mouth while convulsing.\\" Hamish de Bretton- Gordon, a former commander of British Chemical and Biological counterterrorism forces, told BBC that the images were very similar to previous incidents he had witnessed, although he could not verify the footage. Foreign government assessments According to public statements, intelligence agencies in Israel, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Turkey, and Germany concluded that the Syrian government was most likely responsible for the attacks. Western intelligence agencies agreed that video evidence is consistent with the use of a nerve agent, such as sarin. Laboratory tests showed traces of sarin, in blood and hair samples collected from emergency workers who responded to the attacks. Russia said there was no evidence tying the Syrian government to the attack and that it was likely carried out by an opposition group. =France= On 2 September, the French government published a nine- page intelligence report blaming the Syrian government for the Ghouta attacks. An unnamed French government official said that the analysis was carried out by the Directorate-General for External Security (DGSE) and Direction du renseignement militaire (DRM) based on satellite and video images, on-the- ground sources, and samples collected from two April attacks. The report said analysis of samples collected from attacks in Saraqeb and Jobar in April 2013 had confirmed the use of sarin. The Guardian reported that French intelligence had images that showed rocket attacks on opposition neighborhoods from government-controlled areas to the east and west of Damascus. The report said that the government later launched conventional bombing of those neighborhoods in order to destroy evidence of a chemical attack. Based on analysis of 47 videos, the report said at least 281 fatalities occurred. Using other sources and extrapolation a chemical attack model estimated the total number of death at approximately 1,500. =Germany= The Bundesnachrichtendienst said it intercepted a phone call between a Hezbollah official and the Iranian Embassy in which the Hezbollah representative criticised Assad's decision to attack with poison gas, apparently confirming its use by the Syrian government. German newspaper Der Spiegel reported on 3 September that BND President Gerhard Schindler told them that based on the agency's evidence, Germany now shared the United Kingdom, United States, and France's view that the attacks were carried out by the Syrian government. However, they also said the attack may have been much more potent than intended, speculating that there may have been an error in mixing the chemical weapons used.Matthias Gebauer, Der Spiegel, 3 September 2013, Gas Attack: Germany Offers Clue in Search for Truth in Syria =Israel= Without going into detail, Israeli Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz said on 22 August 2013 that Israel's intelligence assessment was that the Syrian government used chemical weapons in the Damascus area. Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon said the Syrian government had already used chemical weapons against the rebels on a smaller scale multiple times prior to the Ghouta attacks. Fox News reported that Unit 8200 helped provide intelligence to the United States, Israel's closest international ally, implicating the Syrian government in the attacks. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the General debate of the sixty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly that Syrian government used the chemical weapons against its own people. =Russia= Russian officials said that there was no proof that the government of Syria had a hand in the chemical attacks. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov described the American, British and French intelligence reports as \\"unconvincing\\" and said at a joint news conference with his French counterpart Laurent Fabius after the release of the United Nations report in mid-September that he continued to believe the rebels carried out the attack. Russian President Vladimir Putin said he wanted to see evidence that would make it \\"obvious\\" who used chemical weapons in Ghouta. In a commentary published in The New York Times on 11 September 2013, Putin wrote that \\"there is every reason to believe [poison gas] was used not by the Syrian Army, but by opposition forces, to provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons,\\". Lavrov said on 18 September that \\"new evidence\\" given to Russia by the Syrian government would be forthcoming. =Turkey= The Turkish government-run Anadolu Agency published an unconfirmed report on 30 August 2013, pointing to the Syrian 155th Missile Brigade and the 4th Armored Division as the perpetrators of the two attacks. It said the attack had involved 15 to 20 missiles with chemical warheads at around 02:45 on 21 August, targeting residential areas between Douma and Zamalka in Eastern Ghouta. It claimed that the 155th Missile Brigade had used 9K52 Luna-M missiles, M600 missiles, or both, fired from Kufeyte, while other rockets with a 15- to 70-kilometer range were fired by the 4th Armored Division from Mount Qasioun. The agency did not explain its source. =United Kingdom= A report on the attacks by the United Kingdom's Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) was published on 29 August 2013 prior to a vote on intervention by the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. The report said at least 350 people were killed and that it was \\"highly likely\\" that the attacks had been carried out by the Syrian government, resting in part on the firm view that the Syrian opposition was not capable of carrying out a chemical weapons attack on this scale, and on the JIC view that the Syrian government had used chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war on a small scale on 14 previous occasions. Analysis of the Ghouta attacks themselves was based largely on reviewing video footage and publicly available witness evidence. The report conceded problems with motivation for the attacks, saying there was \\"no obvious political or military trigger for regime use of CW on an apparently larger scale now.\\" British officials said they believe the Syrian military used chemical weapons, including the nerve agent sarin, on a small scale against the opposition on at least 14 times prior to the Ghouta attacks and described \\"a clear pattern of regime use\\" of the nerve agent since 2012. A vote in the House of Commons to approve UK participation in military action against Syria was narrowly rejected, with some MPs arguing that the case for Syrian government culpability was not sufficiently strong to justify approving action.The Guardian, 30 August 2013, Blow to Cameron's authority as MPs rule out British assault on Syria Prime Minister David Cameron himself had been forced to concede that \\"in the end there is no 100 percent certainty about who is responsible.\\"Associated Press, 29 August 2013, UK Prime Minister Cameron loses Syria war vote , =United States= The map of \\"Areas of Influence\\" and \\"Areas Reportedly affected by the 21 August Chemical Attack\\" that was published by the White House on 30 August 2013. A controversial \\"US government assessment of the Ghouta attacks\\" was published by the White House on 30 August 2013, with a longer classified version made available to members of Congress. The report blamed the chemical attacks on the Syrian government, saying rockets containing a nerve agent were fired from government-held territory into neighborhoods in the early morning, impacting at least 12 locations. It stated 1,429 people were killed, including at least 426 children. It dismissed the possibility that evidence supporting the US government's conclusion could have been manufactured by the opposition, stating it \\"does not have the capability\\" to fabricate videos, eyewitness accounts, and other information. The report also said that the US believed Syrian officials directed the attacks, based on \\"intercepted communications.\\" A major element, as reported by news media, was an intercepted telephone call between a Syrian Ministry of Defense official and a Syrian 155th Brigade chemical weapons unit commander in which the former demanded answers for the attacks. According to some reports, this phone intercept was provided to the U.S. by Israeli Intelligence Corps Unit 8200. The U.S. government assessment suggested a motive for the attack, describing it as \\"a desperate effort to push back rebels from several areas in the capital's densely packed eastern suburbs.\\" The report then states that evidence suggests \\"the high civilian death toll surprised and panicked senior Syrian officials, who called off the attack and then tried to cover it up.\\" Secretary of State John Kerry later announced that hair, blood, soil, and cloth samples collected from the attack sites had tested positive for sarin or its immediate breakdown products. At least three members of Congress, expressed skepticism about the US intelligence report, calling the evidence circumstantial and thin. Obama's request that Congress authorize military force was not put to a vote of either the House of Representatives or the Senate, and the president ultimately admitted that \\"I wouldn't say I'm confident\\" that he could convince Congress to support strikes against Syria. Democratic Party Representative Alan Grayson offered some details regarding the classified report, which he described as 12 pages long, and criticized both the four-page public summary and the classified report. Grayson said the unclassified summary relied on \\"intercepted telephone calls, 'social media' postings and the like, but not one of these is actually quoted or attached … (As to whether the classified summary is the same, I couldn't possibly comment, but again, draw your own conclusion.)\\" Grayson cited as a problematic example the intercepted phone call between a Syrian Ministry of Defense official and the Syrian 155th Brigade, the transcript of which was not provided in the classified report, leaving Grayson unable to judge the accuracy of a report in The Daily Caller that the call's implications had been misrepresented in the report. The AP quoted anonymous US intelligence officials as saying that the evidence presented in the report linking Assad to the attack was \\"not a slam dunk.\\" Jeffrey Goldberg also reported that James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, personally told President Obama that the case for the Syrian government's responsibility was strong but not a \\"slam dunk.\\" The AP later characterized the evidence released by the administration as circumstantial and said the government had denied its requests for more direct evidence, including satellite imagery and communications intercepts cited in the government assessment. IPS news analyst Gareth Porter questioned why the report was released by the White House as a \\"government assessment\\" as opposed being released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence as an \\"intelligence community assessment.\\" Porter quoted former intelligence officials who said the report was \\"evidently an administration document\\" and who also suggested evidence was \\"cherry-picked\\" to support the conclusion that the Syrian government carried out the attacks. On 8 September 2013, the then White House Chief-of-Staff, Denis McDonough said the administration lacks the \\"irrefutable, beyond-a-reasonable-doubt evidence\\", but that a \\"common-sense test\\" implicates Assad. The U.S. publicly stated there was no \\"reliable\\" evidence that the opposition had access to chemical weapons, although Seymour Hersh reported that U.S. intelligence agencies privately assessed some rebel factions to be capable of sarin production. Legal status =Attack= At the time of the attack, Syria was not a member of the Chemical Weapons Convention. However, Human Rights Watch argues that the Ghouta chemical attack was illegal under a different international agreement: > Syria is a party to the 1925 Geneva Gas protocol, which bans the use in war > of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and of all analogous liquids, > materials or devices. The use of chemical weapons is also prohibited as a > matter of customary international humanitarian law, or the laws of war. The > prohibition on the use of chemical weapons applies to all armed conflicts, > including so-called non-international armed conflicts such as the current > fighting in Syria. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former > Yugoslavia, in the Tadic case, stated \\"there undisputedly emerged a general > consensus in the international community on the principle that the use of > [chemical] weapons is also prohibited in internal armed conflicts.\\" =International Criminal Court referral= Human Rights Watch stated that the UN Security Council should refer the Syria situation to the International Criminal Court (ICC) \\"to ensure accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity.\\" Amnesty International also said that the Syria situation should be referred to the ICC because \\"the best way for the United States to signal its abhorrence for war crimes and crimes against humanity and to promote justice in Syria, would be to reaffirm its support for the Rome Statute establishing the International Criminal Court.\\" However, as the amendment to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court explicitly making it a war crime to use chemical weapons in an internal conflict has not been ratified by most states nor Syria, the legal situation is complex and reliant on the attack being a part of a wider war crime.

As a visually- impaired athlete Edgson competes in the B3 classification.  Early life  Born in North Vancouver on 6 May 1969, Edgson moved to Nanaimo at a young age. He played ice hockey, soccer, and gymnastics but found that his visual impairment did not negatively affect him in swimming as it might in other sports and began swimming competitively at the age of eleven.  Swimming  He has competed internationally in both disability and able-bodied swimming events from age 14. Edgson set nine world records during a career that lasted twelve years. With 18 Paralympic gold medals Edgson is one of the most successful Canadian athletes of all time. He is a three-time recipient of the BC Disabled Athlete of the Year Award and was inducted into the Terry Fox Hall of Fame in 2006. In 2009 Edgson became the first Paralympian to be honoured with a place in Swimming Canada's Circle of Excellence. In 2013, he was inducted in to the Greater Victoria Sports Hall of Fame and in 2015 he was named to the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame. At the 1984 Summer Paralympics in Long Island Edgson won five medals (four gold and one silver) and set four new records. His most successful haul came four years later in Gothenburg when he won nine events. He was chosen to carry the Canadian flag at the closing ceremony. Edgson went on to win four more gold medals and a silver in 1992 in Barcelona. After retiring from international competition Edgson became the finance director for the Canadian Paralympic Committee.

It returned one Member of Parliament to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, elected by the first past the post voting system. Vacancy The vacancy came about due to the death of the sitting member, Henry Charles Richards on 1 June 1905. Richards died in a London nursing home of heart disease, aged 54. He had been Conservative MP for the seat of Finsbury East since the 1895 general election. Electoral history The seat had been Conservative since Richards gained it in 1895 from the Liberals. He easily held the seat at the last election, with an increased vote share: Richards Candidates The Conservatives selected Nathaniel Cohen as their candidate to defend the seat. He had contested the 1900 general election as Conservative candidate for Penryn and Falmouth. The local Liberal Association re-selected 53-year-old Allen Baker to challenge for the seat. He was a Canadian- born engineer, specialising in machinery for the confectionery and bakery industries. He was a Quaker. Baker followed his father’s professional footsteps and entered the family engineering business. In 1879 they set up business in Finsbury. As Quakers, the Baker family tried to run a model business taking a paternal interest in the welfare of their workforce and introducing schemes such as shorter working days, encouraging employees to participate in health and insurance plans and fostering a relaxed approach on the shop floor, perhaps to the detriment of profits.http://www.bphs.net/GroupFacilities/J/JosephBakerAndSons/index.htm#13 Baker and Sons also had connections to the motor car industry and in around 1902, the company held an agency for the American car manufacturers Stevens- Duryea. Baker had represented East Finsbury on the London County Council (LCC) as a Progressive since 1895. During his time on the LCC he acted as Chairman of the Highways Committee.Who was Who, OUP 2007 Campaign Polling Day was fixed for 29 June 1905, 28 days after the death of the previous member. The Liberal campaign was launched with a visit from leading Liberal MP John Burns to speak on Allen Baker's platform.J. Allen Baker, Member of Parliament: A Memoir The two candidates throughout the campaign were on the most cordial of terms. However, they differed on the key issue of trade. Cohen supported Chamberlain's Imperial Preference campaign for Tariff Reform. Allen Baker's Canadian background helped him to counter this policy in support of Free trade. At the previous General Election, Allen Baker had opposed the Boer War and that stance now seemed to be of help to his campaign. On the eve of poll, David Lloyd George who spoke at Allen Baker's final meeting wound up the Radicals to a frenzy of excitement with one of the greatest of his election speeches. Result Polling Day was wet, which usually told against the Liberal Party, but they gained the seat and recorded a massive 14.2% swing: Baker Aftermath At the 1906 general election, Baker and the Liberals held the seat with a slightly reduced majority: Cohen did not stand for parliament again, however he served on the London County Council representing the City of London from 1907-1911.

The program permits Direct Loan borrowers who make 120 qualifying monthly payments under a qualifying repayment plan, while working full-time for a qualifying employer, to have the remainder of their balance forgiven.https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/about/data-center/student/loan- forgiveness/pslf-data The earliest time in which borrowers could receive forgiveness under the program was after October 1, 2017. The Department of Education reported that 2,215 borrowers had the remainder of their respective student loans forgiven under the program as of April 30, 2020.https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/06/02/student-loan- forgiveness-rejected/#7aa6715f38bb  Qualifying employers  Government organizations or agencies (Federal, state or local), 501(c)(3) organizations as defined by the IRS, and some other types of not-for-profit organizations providing designated public services qualify for PSLF. The nature of the individual's job responsibilities is not a determining factor in whether the employment qualifies. Rather, only the employer's status as a qualifying employer determines whether the employment qualifies. With limited exception, the individual must be directly employed by the qualifying employer. Therefore, government contractors will not qualify on the basis of their government contracts. Instead, they must independently be a qualifying employer. Another example is the national labs. Employees at national labs such as a Department of Energy or National Nuclear Security Administration Lab, do not qualify on the basis of managing a lab for the government; rather, the managing entity of the lab must be a qualifying employer.  Eligible loans  Any loan made under the Direct Loan Program can qualify for PSLF. In particular, Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, PLUS Loans, and Federal Direct Consolidation Loans qualify for PSLF. Loans in the FFEL program or Federal Perkins Loans can be consolidated into a Direct Consolidation Loan to become eligible for the program. Private student loans are ineligible to be consolidated into a Direct Loan and thus cannot be discharged under the PSLF program.  Qualifying for forgiveness  An individual qualifies for PSLF after making 120 on-time, monthly payments under a qualifying repayment plan while working full-time for a qualifying employer. After the borrower has made 120 qualifying payments, any remaining balance of the borrower’s eligible student loan is forgiven without any tax implications. Currently, there is no cap as to the amount of forgiveness a borrower can receive. Those interested in receiving PSLF should regularly submit the \\"Employment Certification Form\\" for PSLF. This form will be used by the Department of Education's contractor, FedLoan Servicing, to determine whether an individual's employment and payments qualify for the program.https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/files/public-service- employment-certification-form.pdf  Qualifying payment plans  Multiple plans are available to those interested in the PSLF program. Those wishing to seek forgiveness under the PSLF should make payments under one of the income- driven repayment plans, including Income Contingent Repayment, Income Based Repayment, Pay As You Earn, or Revised Pay As You Earn. On May 23, 2018, the U.S. Department of Education announced a second-chance plan for people in public service jobs who were denied loan forgiveness because they chose the wrong repayment plan. The DoED will use $350 million set aside by Congress in a fix-it fund to help people seeking reconsideration. The money will be distributed on a first-come, first-served basis.  Future reduction proposals  For his 2015 budget proposal to Congress, President Barack Obama proposed capping Public Service Loan Forgiveness at $57,500 for all new borrowers. Analysis at the website Educated Risk, however, details the difficulty of modifying PSLF: The 2016 Republican budget resolution proposed to eliminate the PSLF program to all new student loan borrowers. A recent GAO report found that the cost of loan forgiveness has been underestimated, leading many commentators to speculate that a new Republican administration and Congress will take steps to curb the problem. President Donald Trump proposed eliminating the PSLF in his 2018 budget proposal. Similarly, the Republican- proposed PROSPER Act would have eliminated the PSLF. Any changes would have only applied to new borrowers as of July 1, 2019. The PROSPER Act is considered \\"dead\\" with Democrats retaking control of the House of Representatives in 2019. President Trump's 2019 budget proposed eliminating the PSLF. The elimination would have only affected new borrowers as of July 1, 2020.https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2019/03/12/trump-proposes-to- end-student-loan-forgiveness-program/#4e72e3c6415e Trump's 2021 fiscal budget makes a similar proposal that would only apply to new borrowers.https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamminsky/2020/02/11/trump-proposes- repealing-public-service-loan-forgiveness--can-he-do-that/#6b6bac3cbdbb Contradictory claims by the government regarding eligibility and litigation In December 2016, it was reported that some employees who had been previously told by the government that their jobs were eligible for the program were later told that their jobs were not eligible.They Thought They Qualified for Student Loan Forgiveness. Years Later, the Government Changes Its Mind., New York Times, December 20, 2016 In response, the American Bar Association joined four individual plaintiffs who were denied eligibility under PSLF in a lawsuit against the United States Department of Education to stop the Department’s decision to retroactively refuse to honor loan forgiveness commitments it made to individuals who \\"have dedicated their careers to public service.\\" ABA sues Department of Education over retroactive denials to lawyers under Public Service Loan Forgiveness, December 20, 2016 The ABA argued the Department of Education \\"substantially changed its policy on PSLF-eligible employers\\" which directly contradicts statutory procedures for modifying regulations requiring public notice and comment periods. On February 22, 2019, a New York federal district court found The Department of Education's actions \\"arbitrary and capricious.\\" The Court found: “In adopting the new standards, the Department failed to display awareness of its changed position, provide a reasoned analysis for that decision and take into account the serious reliance interests affected.”https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/02/26/this-court- ruling-could-have-big-implications-public-service-loan-forgiveness/ The Court vacated The Department's denial letters and remanded the matters to The Department of Education for reconsideration. Such ruling could lay the groundwork for borrowers who were denied loan forgiveness after being told they were eligible to appeal. The court classified the department's position as \\"nonsense\\". The Department elected not to appeal the ruling.http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/in-about-face-several-aba- employees-are-told-they-qualify-for-public-service-loan-forgiveness The Department of Education subsequently stated that all full-time ABA employees are employed in “a public service job” for a “public service organization” as part of a settlement between the ABA and The Department.http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/all-aba-employees-are- eligible-for-loan-forgiveness-program-after-litigation-settles The Education Department further stated that its decision does not restrict the agency from changing the definition of a public service organization in new regulations in the future.

An attorney in Ruston, Louisiana, Shadoin resigned his legislative seat in 2018 to join the administration of Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards as the deputy counsel in the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries under agency secretary Jack Montoucet. Background In 1971, Shadoin graduated from Ruston High School and in 1975 obtained a Bachelor of Business Administration degree from Louisiana Tech University, at which he a member of Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. In 1978, he received his Juris Doctor degree from Louisiana State University Law Center in Baton Rouge. From 1991 to 1994, Shadoin served as the Ruston city attorney. From 1994 to 2006, he was a member of the Lincoln Parish School Board. Shadoin and his wife, the former Carol Brasuell, have four children. Political life A Moderate Republican, Shadoin defeated the more conservative fellow Republican, Jason Paul Bullock (born 1977), also of Ruston, in the general election held on November 19, 2011, to choose a successor to Republican Hollis Downs, a professor at Louisiana Tech University. In a low-turnout contest, Shadoin received 4,186 votes (54.4 percent) to Bullock's 3,513 votes (45.6 percent).Louisiana Secretary of State, General election returns, November 19, 2011 In the nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 22, Bullock had led the balloting with 45 percent, with Shadoin trailing at 39 percent. A third Republican candidate, Jacob \\"Jake\\" Halley, of Farmerville, a consultant with an emergency preparedness company, held the remaining but critical 16 percent of the primary vote. No Democrat sought the position.Louisiana Secretary of State, Primary election returns, October 22, 2011 Halley emphasized the need to promote tourism in both parishes; Bullock, who operates a business that rents construction equipment, the importance of small business, and Shadoin, his legal and political experience and a call for streamling and repeal of unnecessary laws. Shadoin served on these House committees: (1) Civil Law and Procedure, (2) Education, and (3) Judiciary. In May 2013, Shadoin spoke at the Louisiana Film and Entertainment Association event, \\"Laissez Louisiana Film Rouler\\" held in Baton Rouge to support the state's film industry. In 2013, Shadoin voted for a judicial pay raise, which the legislature approved. He favored the removal of term limits on judges, but that amendment failed in the House. He supported a state law which now requires that women working for the state receive the same pay as men in the same job, something already required under a federal provision in 1963. He voted for surrogacy contracts for couples designating another woman to bear their child, a measure handily approved by the legislature. Shadoin voted with the House majority to oppose reductions on penalties for possession of marijuana, to prohibit state enforcement of federal firearm regulations on weapon manufacturers, and to prohibit the publication in the public record of the names of those with concealed weapon permits. On all of these issues, Shadoin voted exactly as his Democratic colleague in neighboring District 10, Gene Reynolds of Minden in Webster Parish. Shadoin's legislative ratings have ranged from 44 to 62 percent from the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry. In 2012, he was rated 40 percent by the National Federation of Independent Business, low business scores for a Republican legislator. In 2013 and 2014, he was rated 88 and 89 percent, respectively, by the conservative Louisiana Family Forum. In 2013 and 2014, Louisiana Right to Life scored him 75 and 100 percent, respectively. In 2013 and 2014, the Louisiana Association of Educators rated him 67 and 75 percent, respectively. In 2013, Shadoin and State Senator Mike Walsworth of West Monroe obtained passage of legislation to name the Louisiana Highway 33 bridge over Lake D'Arbonne in Farmerville in honor of the late State Representative James Peyton Smith of Union Parish. Shadoin's district includes a part of the territory once represented by Smith, whom Shadoin calls \\"one of the greatest men of Union Parish\\". Shadoin ran unopposed for reelection to a second term in the nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 24, 2015. =Tax issues= In March 2016, Shadoin joined a House bipartisan majority for a one-cent increase in the state sales tax. State representatives voted 76 to 28 for the tax hike, a part of the revenue-raising measures pushed by new Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards. A House and Senate conference committee subsequently trimmed the five years for the duration of the tax to expire instead after twenty-seven months, effective from April 1, 2016 to June 30, 2018. Even the sale of Bibles and religious publications and Girl Scout cookies are now subject to the tax. On June 9, 2016, radio talk show host Moon Griffon accused Shadoin of espousing a Democrat voting record based on the lawmakers support for tax increases, which Shadoin declared necessary to support higher education.The Moon Griffon Show, June 9, 2016 On May 9, 2017, Shadoin introduced four previously separate pieces of legislation which collectively would have raised taxes on businesses and lowered them for what he said would constitute 90 percent of individual taxpayers. The combination of the four bills into one was suggested by Shadoin's Democratic colleague, Major Thibaut of New Roads. When his measure was killed in the House Ways and Means Committee, Shadoin said, \\"You can kiss tax reform goodbye.\\" Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards, who backed the Shadoin bill, blamed its defeat on lobbyists. \\"It is disappointing that a small group of members on the House small group of members on the House Ways and Means Committee would block a tax cut for 90 percent of individual tax filers in Louisiana but refused to ask the 80 percent of corporations that pay absolutely nothing in state income taxes to pay their fair share.\\" Moon Griffon again challenged Shadoin on the tax plan on the premise that the bill is based on misleading information because \\"tax filers\\" are not necessarily \\"taxpayers.\\" He again questioned Shadoin's Republican credentials: \\"The 'R' after his name means Ruston, not Republican,\\" Griffon said.The Moon Griffon Show, May 10, 2017. Shadoin's Republican colleague, Jay Morris of Monroe, said that the bills \\"would not help the state's fiscal situation and would in fact make it worse. At the same time it would have made the tax code much more progressive (making higher income earners pay more) and would have eliminated the deduction for federal income. The committee didn't see the benefit from a set of bills that made the state fiscal situation worse in the name of purported tax reform.\\" In June 2017, Jeffrey D. Sadow, a political science professor at Louisiana State University in Shreveport, penned an Internet blog article critical of Shadoin and John Alario of Westwego, the President of the Louisiana State Senate. Sadow contends that Shadoin's backing for tax increases works to the advantage of Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards, as Edwardse seeks a second term in 2019. House successor pending Two Republican candidates sought to succeed Shadoin in the February 23, 2019 special election.

The ride's revealing was part of a large announcement made on August 21, 2013. The roller coaster opened on March 22, 2014. History A trademark for the name \\"FireChaser Express\\" was filed on August 8, 2013. The attraction was official announced in the morning of August 21. The ride will be installed by Ride Entertainment Group, who handles all of Gerstlauer's operations in the Western Hemisphere. In Summer 2013, ground clearance began for the new attraction. A sign was erected near the site with the words \\"Coming in 2014: The next big adventure... It'll be a blast!\\" FireChaser Express opened to the public on March 22, 2014. Story The ride is themed around the fictional Volunteer Fire Station 7 and its fire chief, Pete Embers. Pete is a man of considerable patience and he's always more than happy to let sleeping dogs lie, except when the beautiful Great Smoky Mountains and their forests are endangered. Lately, he's had to deal with local businessman and eccentric fireworks enthusiast \\"Crazy\\" Charlie Cherribaum and his Gas Station and Fireworks Emporium. Because of an increase in dry lightning in the area, Charlie has taken to calling Fire Station 7 on a daily basis, asking them to come out whenever he sees the slightest hint of smoke. To deal with Charlie while leaving his regular volunteers available to deal with real emergencies, Chief Embers has recently decided to deputize almost everyone in town to keep an eye on Charlie and his latest creation, the Big Bertha firecracker, which is rumored (by Charlie) to be the most powerful firecracker anybody in town has ever seen; this claim has driven Pete over the edge, and now he's looking for any excuse to have Charlie and his business shut down. Ride FireChaser Express' theme is based on the several volunteer-based fire departments surrounding the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in the 1940s. After a brief message from Fire Chief Embers, the station's siren goes off as the \\"truck\\" launches out of the station and navigates a few curves before hitting the chain lift. The ride proceeds into a small curve drop into another curve then a drop into several camelbacks. After the camelbacks the train goes through a tower and navigates through Crazy Charlie's fireworks testing range before hitting an s-bend and entering Charlie Cherribaum's Gasoline and Fireworks Emporium, through the storage warehouse. Charlie panics, saying he sees smoke, but then dismisses it as a result of his paranoia as a spark ignites a box of firecrackers and a few tanks of gas. The fire catches Charlie by surprise, and he tells the volunteers (riders) to watch out for Big Bertha and to leave the building; as he says this, a large firecracker labeled \\"Big Bertha\\" falls into a position where it points directly at the train, and the fire ignites the fuse, which begins to throw sparks. As the fireworks start to go off, the room fills with smoke and a series of loud bangs are heard as the train accelerates backwards onto a different track, where it navigates a few more turns and passes underneath another fire tower before hitting the final brake run. Fire Chief Embers praises the work of the volunteers as the train in the station is launched. The track switches again as the train backs into the station, where riders unload and exit the station. The track length is .

He was Personal Secretary to Bonnie Prince Charlie during his exile in Rome. He was a joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1783. William Dickinson after James Tassie Early life He was the only son of William Lumisden, a law agent in Edinburgh, and his wife, Mary Bruce, daughter of Robert Bruce, an Edinburgh merchant. He was educated at the High School in Edinburgh then studied law at the University of Edinburgh, which he followed until the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745. The '45 On the recommendation of Dr Alexander Cunningham, a younger son of Sir William Cunningham of Caprington, Ayrshire, Lumisden became private secretary to Prince Charles Edward shortly after his arrival in Edinburgh. He accompanied the prince throughout the campaign, and was present at the battle of Culloden. On the eve of the battle the prince's aide-de-camp wrote to Ewen MacPherson of Cluny, asking him to take particular care of Lumisden and Thomas Sheridan, \\"as they carry the sinews of war\\". After the battle Lumisden obeyed the order to rendezvous at Fort Ruthven, where a message from Charles Edward on 17 April warned all to look after their own safety. He was included in the Act of Attainder, and, after staying in Highland fastnesses for four months, went to Edinburgh disguised in a black wig, as the liveried groom of a lady who rode pillion behind him on a horse. After lurking in concealment in his father's house till October, he accompanied to London, as a poor teacher, the king's messenger, who had been in Scotland citing witnesses for the treason trials. Exile At the end of 1745 Lumisden embarked at the Towers Stairs for Rouen. Here he lived in poverty, until in May 1749 he obtained the first grant of an allowance made by the French court to the Spanish exiles. He then went via Paris to Rome, where early in 1757 he was appointed salaried under-secretary to the Chevalier de St. George. In September 1762 he became sole secretary, and he held the post till the death of the chevalier in January 1766. In 1758–9 Lumisden undertook a secret mission to France, but otherwise his duties consisted in answering requests for honours, or appeals for help from supporters of the Stuart cause. He was continued in office by Charles Edward, who made use of him very much as a factotum. Ultimately, in December 1768, he was dismissed by Charles for refusing to allow him to attend an oratorio while drunk. Not long afterwards he declined an invitation to return. Paris In the spring of 1769 Lumisden set out for Paris, and now having an income from his father's estate, he became a writer. Around 12 June 1770, he met Charles Burney (composer and musicographist), recommended to him as a potential shrewd tip and information provider for his musical state of art trip throughout Europe between 1770 and 1772; The A petition having been presented in his favour on 15 February 1773, he was allowed to return home, and five years later a free pardon was granted him. He visited Scotland, but continued for a period to make Paris his base. Death In 1783 Lumisden was in Edinburgh and was a joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He appears to have lived at Thistle Court in the New Town.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1799-1800 Lumisden died in Edinburgh on 25 December 1801.

He was part of the Mexican muralism movement, whose work was particularly influenced by Manuel Rodríguez Lozano. Life Nefero was born Ignacio Nieves Beltrán in Tampico, Tamaulipas, Mexico. He went to study painting at the Academy of San Carlos, meeting Manuel Rodríguez Lozano, who was director of the school at the time and suggested his artistic name, which means “beautiful” in ancient Egyptian. A friend and disciple of Rodríguez Lozano, he was invited to collaborate on a mural called Piedad en el desierto (Mercy in the desert) when Rodríguez Lozano was incarcerated at Lecumberri. The work was later moved to the Palacio de Bellas Artes. In 1951 the Instituto Francés de América Latina awarded him a grant to study at the École des Beaux- Arts in Paris. There he had an individual exhibition at the Galerie Artiel, and he traveled Europe the following year, visiting Spain, Belgium, Holland, Austria, Italy, Yugoslavia and Greece. Nefero died at age 85. Career Nefero’s relationship with Rodríguez Lozano led to his first individual exhibition at the Galería Gama (owned by María Asúnsolo) in 1943. His other individual shows include the Salón de la Plástica Mexciana (1953), the Instituto Francés para América Latina (1958), the inauguration of the Museo de Arte Moderno and Museo de la Ciudad de México in 1958 and the Centro Deportivo Israelita (1960), along with several exhibitions at the gallery of the Excélsior newspaper and the Universidad Feminina in Veracruz. His work was also shown in collective exhibitions in Mexico, France, Peru, Colombia, Cuba, Sweden and Israel, mostly in the 1940s and 1950s. His important collective shows in Mexico included those at the Galería Benjamin Franklin, the workshop of Rodríguez Lozano and the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana. His work can be found in notable private and public collections such as that of the Emilio Portes Gil family, that of José Alvarez Amezquita, that of Marte R. Gómez and in various art museums in Mexico and Israel. In addition to easel work, he created five murals for the Terrace de los Gatos condominium in California and in 1962 he depicted the evangelization of the Americas on the walls of the Hacienda Real del Puente in Xochitepec, Morelos . From 1954 to 1955 he taught at the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \\"La Esmeralda\\" than with various schools affiliated with the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes y Literatura. Nefero was one of the fifty two artists along with such names as Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera to found the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana (SPM) in 1949. To honor the fortieth anniversary of his career the SPM held exhibition of his work produced in 1978 and 1979. In 2009, the institution sponsored a book by Jesús Meza León focusing on this painter based on interviews done before his death. His home state paid also tribute to the artist at the 2013 Festival Internacional Tamaulipas. Artistry Nefero was part of the Mexican muralism movement of the 20th century. In particular, he was a disciple of Manuel Rodríguez Lozano. Rodríguez Lozano’s influence is strong in his work, prompting Mexican art critic Margarita Nelken to write “ From his teacher, he has learned two lessons: to subject himself with unquenchable rigor to the apprenticeship of his chosen profession and the intolerable hypocrisy… of binding artistic creativity to the picturesqueness of appearances.” Nelken also wrote that his easel work “decants” Mexico in his painting. Nefero was also known as a portrait painter, with his 1946 self- portrait becoming the image most associated with the artist. In 1966 there was an exhibited dedicated to this work at the Museo de Arte Popular, prompting Rodolfo Usigli to write that “…they are strong, sober, firm and elegant. In these works, both model and painter co-exist, human faith and destiny with their particular characteristics and loyalty to artistic form.” References Category:2005 deaths Category:1920 births Category:20th-century Mexican painters Category:Mexican male painters Category:21st-century Mexican painters Category:Mexican muralists Category:People from Tampico, Tamaulipas Category:Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \\"La Esmeralda\\" faculty ","title":"Nefero"},{"id":"40313466","text":"The 38th Reconnaissance Squadron is an active United States Air Force Unit, originally constituted as the 38th Pursuit Squadron in November 1940.

After a professional career as a drummer, he became a well- known television actor in the 1970s playing the character Barend Servet in the Wim T. Schippers-directed shows on VPRO television. Biography Blokker was born in Den Helder and studied drums at the Amsterdamse Muziekschool, and worked in a number of orchestras in the Netherlands and Germany, including the Snip en Snap Revue. He was drum teacher as well; one of his students was Jan Keizer, who gained fame with BZN. Blokker became widely known in the 1970s playing the character of Barend Servet in a series of television shows: De Fred Hachéshow (1971), Barend is weer bezig (1972-1973), and Van Oekel's Discohoek (1974). These shows, conceived, written, and directed by Wim van der Linden, Wim T. Schippers, Gied Jaspars, and Ruud van Hemert and aired on VPRO, caused consternation by having naked dancers and extras, cursing actors, and absurdist humor. After the controversial scene in which Barend Servet interviewed Juliana of the Netherlands, Blokker received angry letters and phone calls, even a bomb threat. The Barend Servet character had a hit song in 1973 with the song \\"Waar moet dat heen, hoe zal dat gaan?\\" and made public appearances as late as 1981. Blokker had minor roles in the television shows Zeg 'ns Aaa, SamSam, Pompy de Robodoll, Seth & Fiona, and Filmpje!, and in the 1990 television production of the Herman Heijermans play Eva Bonheur. In the 1980s he presented the VPRO nature program Puur natuur (with Adeline van Lier) and was a commentator for an AVRO program, Prijs je rijk.

It was the oldest continually publishing technology-specific news wire service from 1983-2002. It included news reports on computing, interactive media, telecommunications and cybersecurity spanned the formative years of Silicon Valley and the advent of personal computers. The Washington Post Company acquired Newsbytes in 1997. The archive of Newsbytes stories is currently on the Lexis-Nexis research database under the code NWSBYT Predating the Internet, Newsbytes News Network came to be considered a “boot camp“ for online journalism. Its alumni have gone on to work for CNet, ZDNet, The Wall Street Journal, Reuters, and The New York Times.(9) Editor and Publisher, \\"Washingtonpost.com Folds Newsbytes Unit\\" May 23, 2002. http://www.editorandpublisher.com/PrintArticle/Washingtonpost-com-Folds- Newsbytes-Unit At the height of its popularity in the mid-1990s, Newsbytes was published by over 180 media outlets and produced almost 100 technology news reports daily.(10) Free for All: The Internet’s Transformation of Journalism, by Elliot King, page 105, http://www.editorandpublisher.com/PrintArticle/Washingtonpost-com-Folds- Newsbytes-Unit Northwestern University Press, Mar 29, 2010. Its success was buoyed by enthusiasm for news about emerging technologies. Newsbytes was able to offer instantaneous delivery of technology information before the invention of the Internet.(6) St. Croix Valley Press, “Spanning the Globe from Stillwater” November 30, 1995.  History  Wendy Woods Gorski had the idea to create an online publication out of what she was already writing daily for her broadcast news position in San Francisco. As a reporter and editor working under the name \\"Wendy Woods,\\" she compiled news leads for her assignment editors at CNN (San Francisco Bureau) and KGO-TV (ABC) in 1982 and realized these news story ideas could be of interest to the general public. These summaries included contact information for the sources. Newsbytes officially launched in 1983 as a \\"user publishing\\" feature on an online service called The Source, owned by Reader’s Digest, based in McLean, Virginia.(7) Netweaver interview, 1986 http://groupjazz.com/netweaver/archive/nw86-71.html \\"Newsbytes\\", began to earn royalties and an audience. In its first few years, the weekly stories were written with a style that reflected television writing: succinct stories with an irreverent flair. \\"(Newsbytes) reflected her personality. It was, in some ways, the very first blog. It was infused with her being and when I joined her in 1985 I took that lesson to heart, putting my personality into my own work from Atlanta\\", said Dana Blankenhorn, one of the service’s early writers.(8) Dana Blankenhorn, The Street October 1, 2012 http://www.thestreet.com/story/11722359/1/the-internet-returns-journalism-to- the-19th-century.html By the end of the first year Steve Gold, a journalist in Sheffield, England, joined the company and contributed European technology news. Gradually the service evolved from summaries to fleshed-out stories and included the work of multiple reporters in different US cities and countries. Newsbytes stories were aimed at a broad cross-section of both business and consumer users of information technology, which contributed to the service’s wide appeal. Newsbytes was advertiser-free which gave it the added advantage of public trust and objectivity in a niche industry.(13) Interview with Wendy Woods, July 28, 2013. Newsbytes News Network soon developed a team of 19 journalists in San Francisco, Denver, Minneapolis, Los Angeles, New York, Washington DC, Boston, Toronto, London, Moscow, Belgium, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Sydney, Toronto, Manila, and New Delhi. Reporters provided on-site coverage of major industry trade shows including COMDEX, CES, CeBIT, and MacWorld, focusing on the latest marketing, legal, business, and product trends. Many magazines and newspapers, including The Computer Paper, Puget Sound Computer User, I/O magazine in Japan, and the Sydney Morning Herald were keen to get their hands on computer-specific news, since all the news networks at the time only carried general news. During its nearly two decades of existence, Newsbytes News Network stories were syndicated to some 180 magazines, newspapers, newsletters, and online services worldwide. Among the largest online services were Compuserve, America Online, BIX, ZiffNet, The Information Access Co., Dow Jones News/Retrieval, PointCast, and other information providers located in the United States, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. A Toronto-based company called Clarinet prepared the wire feed for Unix systems that went directly to corporate information technologists. Weekly estimated readership reached 4.5 million.(2) Book: Free for All: The Internet's Transformation of Journalism By Elliot King, Northwestern University Press; Original edition (March 29, 2010) In 1987, Wendy Woods Gorski teamed with Peter P. Vekinis, an entrepreneur at the time. Peter originated the Workwriter computer package, was owner of the Technology Channel, creator of the Picosat satellite system, and designer of a C language compiler for the Amstrad 6128personal computer system. Peter and Wendy designed the content-specific format, created \\"push news\\" to clients (an unknown feature at the time). Peter devised a system where news would be delivered to the clients' remote printers, connected via modem so that breaking news would be delivered instantly. (14) Interview with Peter Vekinis, July 15, 2013. The company also expanded distribution to CD-ROM subscriptions and email subscriptions. Nels Johnson, a San Francisco-based programmer, created software that allowed PC owners to process the news feed offline and display headlines or full stories. Wendy also created a weekly TV newscast for The Computer Show at a San Jose television channel. Woods also continued to be a correspondent for Computer Chronicles, a PBS program, from 1984-1990.(15) Computer Chronicles archives online: Peter left Newsbytes in 1990 to pursue other interests and sold his share of the company to Steve Gold, an early Newsbytes contributor and co- owner.  Move to Minnesota  Wendy and husband Nick Gorski moved the company headquarters and family to Stillwater, Minnesota in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area in 1993. Newsbytes was operated out of the carriage house behind their Victorian home at 406 West Olive Street from 1993 through 2002. In the mid-90s, Steve Laliberte, also living in Minnesota and the former director of McGraw-Hill’s competing BIX service, became a Newsbytes co-owner. He created Newsbytes News Network’s website, on the emerging Internet to make subscriptions available to the general public. Innovations included 15-minute delayed quotes for the stock price of publicly held companies via links in the stories, complete keyword search of archives, and additional news feeds from The Business Wire.  Business Model  Newsbytes News Network’s financial success stemmed from events made possible by the computer revolution itself. Advantages over traditional print media were electronic distribution (no print costs), the speed of distribution (instantaneous), and a decentralized newsroom of correspondents who worked from their home offices worldwide. The company’s business model consisted of licensing the news stream, media partnerships (Ziff-Davis Publishing, McGraw Hill, USA Today, Dow Jones News and Retrieval, Reuters, America Online, Compuserve, Newsnet, Dialog, and Applelink), and online downloads. Through multiple media and channels, Newsbytes was distributed to a wide variety of media outlets.(3) St. Paul Pioneer Press, Nov 12, 1996, Byte Marks, p. 1E Newsbytes became an LLC in 1996  Sale to The Washington Post  In 1997, Newsbytes News Network LLC was sold by partners Wendy Woods Gorski (editor-in-chief), Steve Gold (UK bureau chief), Joshua Schneck (marketing director) and Steve Laliberte (technology director) to The Washington Post Company for an undisclosed fee.(4) Press release from The Washington Post http://www.washpostco.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=62487&p;=irol- newsArticle&ID;=55825&highlight;= Wendy served as editor-in-chief of the publication at the Washington Post Company's Post-Newsweek Interactive division until the company discontinued the news service for financial reasons on May 31, 2002, just one year before its 20-year anniversary.

Prior to playing professionally, deGrom attended Stetson University and played college baseball for the Stetson Hatters. DeGrom began playing baseball as a shortstop and was converted into a pitcher during his junior year at Stetson. The Mets selected him in the ninth round of the 2010 MLB draft, and he made his MLB debut with the Mets on May 15, 2014. That year, deGrom was named the National League's (NL) Rookie of the Month twice, and the NL Rookie of the Year. In 2015, 2018, and 2019 deGrom was selected as an MLB All-Star. In 2018, deGrom was the NL ERA leader and won the Cy Young Award. In 2019, he led the NL in strikeouts and won the Cy Young Award for the second year in a row. Amateur career DeGrom attended Calvary Christian Academy in Ormond Beach, Florida, where he played for the school's baseball and basketball teams. As a senior, the Florida Sports Writers Association named deGrom to the All-Florida second team. He also played American Legion baseball, where he was noticed by the coaches for the Stetson Hatters, the college baseball team of Stetson University. After going unselected in the Major League Baseball (MLB) draft out of high school, deGrom enrolled at Stetson and played for the Hatters. He was exclusively a shortstop during his freshman and sophomore seasons. Though he was considered a good fielder with a strong throwing arm, deGrom was a light hitter, with a career .263 batting average. He made his first appearance as a pitcher in May 2009. In the summer of 2009, between his sophomore and junior years, deGrom received an invitation to play collegiate summer baseball for the DeLand Suns of the Florida Collegiate Summer League, which he declined after discovering that they wanted him to play as a pitcher. When deGrom returned to Stetson that fall, the team used him as a relief pitcher, filling the role of their closer, in addition to playing shortstop. He quickly became one of Stetson's best pitchers, so the team moved deGrom into their starting rotation midway through the season. In addition to a fastball, deGrom learned to throw a changeup and a slider. MLB scouts began to take notice of deGrom when he pitched against Chris Sale of Florida Gulf Coast University. In that game, deGrom hit his only home run of the season against Chris Sale. He made 12 starts for the Hatters, pitching to a 4–5 win–loss record with a 4.48 earned run average. Professional career DeGrom in spring training in 2014 =Minor Leagues= The New York Mets selected deGrom in the ninth round as a pitcher, with the 272nd overall selection, of the 2010 Major League Baseball draft. He signed with the Mets, receiving a $95,000 signing bonus. The Mets assigned deGrom to the Kingsport Mets of the Rookie-level Appalachian League, where he made six starts before he was diagnosed with a partial tear of the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in his pitching elbow. He attempted to rehabilitate his arm for four months, but underwent Tommy John surgery to repair the UCL in October. He did not pitch in 2011 while he recovered from the surgery. While rehabilitating, deGrom worked on his changeup with Johan Santana. DeGrom pitched for the Savannah Sand Gnats of the Class A South Atlantic League and the St. Lucie Mets of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League in 2012, finishing the year with a 2.43 ERA in 19 games started. In 2013, he began the season with St. Lucie, but was promoted to the Binghamton Mets of the Class AA Eastern League after two starts due to injuries to Binghamton's Luis Mateo and Cory Mazzoni. He received a promotion to the Las Vegas 51s of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League in June after the Mets promoted Zack Wheeler and Carlos Torres to the major leagues and traded Collin McHugh. He had a combined 4.51 ERA for the season, due to a broken finger suffered during the offseason, which altered the way he threw the ball. The Mets added deGrom to their 40-man roster on November 20, 2013, to protect him from being eligible in the Rule 5 draft. During the offseason, deGrom improved his mechanics, and learned to throw a curveball. He began the 2014 season with Las Vegas, and had a 4–0 win–loss record and a 2.58 ERA in his first seven games started. =New York Mets= 2014 The Mets promoted deGrom to the major leagues on May 12, 2014, after Gonzalez Germen was placed on the disabled list. The Mets planned to use deGrom in relief, but an injury to Dillon Gee required the Mets to insert him into their starting rotation. DeGrom made his major league debut on May 15 against cross-town rival New York Yankees in Citi Field. He faced fellow rookie Chase Whitley, also making his MLB debut. He pitched seven innings, allowing only one run and striking out six, but the Yankees shut out the Mets and won 1–0. DeGrom also collected his first MLB hit in the game in his first career at bat. It was the first hit by a Mets pitcher in the 2014 season ending an 0-for-64 hitless streak, the worst collective mark by a pitching staff to begin a season in MLB history. DeGrom compiled four quality starts in his first four MLB starts, but did not record a win in any of them. On July 8, deGrom pitched seven scoreless innings and recorded 11 strikeouts in giving the Mets their 4,000th franchise victory. Along with Steve Cishek of the Miami Marlins, deGrom was named the National League's (NL) Co-Player of the Week for the period of July 21 to 27 after allowing only one earned run in two starts that week. He was named the NL Rookie of the Month for July. On August 11, deGrom went on the disabled list with rotator cuff tendinitis. Rafael Montero was called up on August 12 in deGrom's place. On August 23, Montero was re-sent back to the 51s to make room for deGrom coming off the disabled list. On September 15, 2014, deGrom faced the Marlins and struck out his first eight batters, tying the MLB record. Near the end of the season, deGrom was shut down for the year, ending his season with a 9–6 record, a 2.69 ERA and 144 strikeouts. DeGrom won the 2014 Sporting News NL Rookie of the Year Award and was named the NL Rookie of the Year by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (the first by a Met since Dwight Gooden in 1984), receiving first place votes on 26 of the 30 ballots. 2015 DeGrom and Clayton Kershaw of the Los Angeles Dodgers were selected as NL Co-Players of the Week for the week ending June 7, 2015. He began the 2015 season with an 8–6 win-loss record and a 2.30 ERA through the end of June, and was named to the NL roster in the 2015 MLB All-Star Game. During the All-Star Game, deGrom struck out the three batters he faced on ten pitches, becoming the first person to do so since pitch counts were recorded. DeGrom pitched to a 14–8 record with a 2.54 ERA and a 0.99 walks plus hits per inning pitched ratio during the 2015 season. DeGrom with the Mets in 2015 Starting Game 1 of the 2015 NLDS, he allowed no runs and five hits over seven innings pitched and tied a Mets franchise postseason record with 13 strikeouts (set by Tom Seaver, Game 1 of the 1973 NLCS). DeGrom won the deciding Game 5 with a six-inning, two-run effort. In Game 3 of the 2015 NLCS against the Chicago Cubs, deGrom pitched seven-inning game, allowing just two runs on four hits, one walk and seven strikeouts, putting the Mets ahead 3–0 and within one game of their first World Series appearance since the 2000 Subway Series. DeGrom started Game 2 of the 2015 World Series on October 28; he allowed four runs on six hits and three walks over five innings and took the loss as the Royals went up, 2–0, in the series. Following the season, deGrom received a Wilson Defensive Player of the Year Award as the best defensive player statistically at his position in Major League Baseball. He also placed seventh in Cy Young Award voting. 2016 DeGrom initially refused to sign the 2016 contract for the $607,000 salary assigned to him. Not yet eligible for salary arbitration, deGrom was bound by the MLB Collective Bargaining Agreement to accept the salary assigned to him by his club. He eventually relented and reluctantly capitulated to signing his contract early in spring training. On July 17 at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, deGrom pitched a complete game shutout against the Philadelphia Phillies, allowing only one hit and one walk while striking out seven opposing batters. His game score of 97 was tied for second-best in Mets history in a nine-inning game. DeGrom's final pitching appearance of the season came on September 1, when he faced the Miami Marlins. He underwent season-ending surgery on his ulnar nerve in late September in order to relieve discomfort in his elbow and numbness in his fingers which had plagued him during the 2016 season. 2017 Eligible for salary arbitration for the first time, deGrom and the Mets avoided an arbitration hearing by agreeing to a salary of $4.05 million for the 2017 season. On June 18, 2017, deGrom hit his first career home run at Citi Field against Joe Ross of the Washington Nationals. deGrom was named NL Player of the Week for the week of June 12–18 after hitting his first home run, posting a 0.53 ERA, allowing eight hits, striking out 12 and walking six in 17 innings over two starts. deGrom recorded wins in eight consecutive starts from June 12 until July 24, tying a franchise record previously set by Seaver, David Cone and Bobby Jones. deGrom recorded the first stolen base of his career on August 4 off of Yu Darvish and Yasmani Grandal of the Dodgers. He became the first Mets pitcher to steal a base since Óliver Pérez in 2008. Of the seven potential starting pitchers who began the season with the Mets, deGrom was the only one who finished the 2017 season without spending any time on the disabled list. deGrom finished the 2017 season with a record of 15-10 and a 3.53 ERA. DeGrom finished eighth in voting for the 2017 NL Cy Young Award. 2018 DeGrom and the Mets agreed on a $7.4 million salary for the 2018 season. On May 6, the Mets placed deGrom on the 10 day disabled list, retroactive to May 3, with a hyperextended pitching elbow. DeGrom had suffered the minor injury while batting during his May 2 start against the Braves. Owning a MLB-leading 1.68 ERA, deGrom was named to the 2018 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. During the All-Star Break, Brodie Van Wagenen, deGrom's sports agent, called for the Mets to engage in contract extension talks, or to \\"seriously consider trade opportunities now\\". On September 3, deGrom tied an MLB record by completing his 25th straight start allowing three or fewer runs. DeGrom recorded his 1,000th career strikeout in his final start of the season on September 26 at Citi Field. DeGrom finished the season 10-9 with a 1.70 ERA, which led the majors and was the third-lowest of any pitcher with 30 starts in a season since MLB lowered the mound following the 1968 season. For the 2018 season he led the majors in lowest home runs per nine innings (0.41). On November 14, deGrom was announced as the National League Cy Young Award winner; he received all but one first place vote. His 10 wins were the fewest in history by a Cy Young Award-winning starting pitcher. DeGrom finished fifth in the National League Most Valuable Player voting and was the only player other than award winner Christian Yelich to receive a first place vote. 2019 During the 2018-19 offseason, the Mets hired Van Wagenen as their general manager. DeGrom and the Mets agreed to a $17 million salary for the 2019 season, the largest annual raise ever for an arbitration-eligible player. With Van Wagenen now negotiating for the Mets rather than deGrom, the two sides agreed to a five-year, $137.5 million contract extension with an option for the 2024 season during spring training in 2019. DeGrom started for the Mets on Opening Day against Max Scherzer, the 2018 Cy Young Award runner- up to deGrom and the 2017 Cy Young Award winner.https://www.sny.tv/mets/news/mets-jacob-degrom-faces-nationals-max- scherzer-on-opening-day-105-pm-on-sny/305748908 DeGrom set a career high in strikeouts in his next start on April 3 with 14. deGrom began the first half of the 2019 season with a 4–7 record and a 3.27 ERA while striking out 138 batters. He was then named to the NL roster in the 2019 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. DeGrom had a remarkable second half, posting a 7–1 record with a 1.44 ERA and 117 strikeouts. He won his second straight Cy Young Award in a near-unanimous vote, receiving 29 of 30 first-place votes, becoming the 11th pitcher in history to win back-to-back Cy Young Awards. In December 2019, the New York Post named him their New York Athlete of the Decade over such competition as Eli Manning, Henrik Lundqvist, Mariano Rivera and Derek Jeter. 2020 In the Covid-shortened 2020 season, deGrom was 4-2 with a 2.38 ERA, and led the National League in strikeouts, for the second consecutive season, with 104. He led the NL in strikeouts per 9 IP (13.765), was 3rd in WHIP (0.956) and hits per 9 IP (6.221), 4th in ERA, 5th in wild pitches (4), 6th in win-loss percentage (.667) and home runs per 9 IP (0.927), and 8th in walks per 9 IP (2.382). He led the NL in stolen bases allowed, with 13. His $25 million salary was the 10th-highest in the NL. Personal life deGrom in August 2015 DeGrom is from DeLeon Springs, Florida. He was raised by his parents, Tony, an AT&T; lineman, and Tammy, a customer service representative for a credit card rewards program. Tony built a batting cage in the backyard for his son to practice. He credits his father for his quiet intensity and humility. He is the youngest of three children of Tony and Tammy; his sisters are named Sarah and Jessica. He grew up an Atlanta Braves fan. Shortly after graduating from high school, deGrom met his wife, Stacey. They were married in November 2014, and live in DeLand, Florida. They have a Morkie, and had their first son, Jaxon, in April 2016. Their second child, a daughter named Aniston, was born in February 2018. At Stetson, deGrom began to grow out his hair. His starts with the Mets led to the trending hashtag on Twitter of \\"#hairwego\\". His hair inspired a promotional \\"Jacob deGrom Hair Hat\\" giveaway at Citi Field during the 2016 season. After learning that an unnamed MLB hitter said that deGrom's hair made it harder to pick up the ball out of his hand, deGrom said in 2016 that he would never cut his hair. However, he cut his hair during the 2017-18 offseason, saying that doing so could add speed to his fastball, and also that he was tired of having long hair. Notably, deGrom has won the NL Cy Young Award in each of the two seasons since he cut his hair. DeGrom is close friends with fellow Mets starting pitchers Steven Matz and Noah Syndergaard, as well as former Mets starting pitchers Matt Harvey and Zack Wheeler.

Acyclic nucleoside phosphonates can have significant antiviral, cytostatic and antiproliferative activities. PMEG can inhibit cell proliferation and cause genotoxicity. PMEG is active against leukemia and melanoma in animal tumor models, and also has antiviral activities against herpes viruses in murine models. Successful application of PMEG and PMEG- derivatives analogs may depend on the development analogs with reduced toxicity and enhanced pharmacokinetic properties to tissues. There are no clinical trials using PMEG listed at clinicaltrials.gov. This suggests that the pharmacokinetic properties of PMEG were too toxic to process forward with. There are several different PMEG-derivatives analogs currently being investigated. GS-9191 and GS-9219 prodrugs are just two of the next generation PMEG compounds being evaluated for antiviral and anticancer activities. Both GS-9191 and GS-9219 have made it into clinical trials, but require additional study. Biology Acyclic nucleoside phosphonates prodrugs require further phosphorylation in the cell in order to become the active metabolite. Once PMEG is phosphorylated into its triphosphate form, host or viral DNA polymerases can use it a substrate during DNA synthesis. Since it is an acyclic nucleoside, lacking a 3'-OH moiety, to further extension of the DNA strand occurs. Thus this agent uses the classical mechanism of DNA chain terminator. PMEG has often been cited for its antiviral activities.

It has a length of approximately 24 km from its source at Gaspereau Lake on the South Mountain south of Kentville to its mouth at Hortonville on the Minas Basin. The lower portion of the river is tidal for 6.5 km until Melanson and there are extensive tidal marshes in the lower reaches. The upper 16 km runs swiftly over gravel beds, boulders and bedrock, except for several dammed sections which form narrow and deep channels. Damming for Hydroelectric generation has resulted in twelve major lakes being connected to the river creating a watershed of 1,375 square kilometres.Natural History of Nova Scotia, Volume 1, Chapter T8 \\"Freshwater Hydrology\\", Nova Scotia Museum (1996) p.152 A major tributary is the Black River which joins the Gaspeareau at White Rock. The Black River once flowed further north into the Cornwallis River but connected to the Gaspereau through a natural erosion process known as river capture.A Natural History of Kings County, Blomidon Naturalist Society, p. 77-78 Fishery Although the Gaspereau is a short river, the riverbed habitat and connecting lakes form an important and productive breeding ground for several species of migratory fish including Gaspereau (Alewife), Rainbow Smelt and Atlantic Salmon. Atlantic Tomcod, Atlantic Sturgeon and Striped Bass spawn in the tidal portion of the river. History and economy Modern vineyard in the Gaspereau River ValleyThe productive fish runs of the Gaspereau attracted a large settlement of the Mi'kmaq people near Melanson. Acadians from the settlements at Grand-Pre were also attracted to the fish runs of the river in the late 1600s and named it after the Gaspereau fish with the name \\"Rivière des Gasparots\\" first appearing in a 1701 census of Acadia. The New England Planters who settled the area after the Expulsion of the Acadians also harvested fish but also cleared the river banks for farming, notably for apple orchards and built saw mills in the upper reaches of the river. Eventually nine sawmills operated on the river system, creating employment through extensive logging of the South Mountain but also disrupting the ecology of the river with dams and sawdust deposits. After an unsuccessful attempt in 1910, a hydroelectric dam was completed a Stivers Falls near White Rock in 1920. It was the first of a series of hydroelectric dams which replaced the remaining water sawmills with a network of hydroelectric dams. Eventually eight dams and five hydroelectric stations were built along the Gaspereau River, diverting some lakes into the Gaspereau which once flowed into the Avon River.Roy Bishop, \\"The Black River: Past People and Power\\", Blomidon Naturalist Society Newsletter, Winter 1994, Vol. 21, No. 4, p. 13-21 Fish ladders were built to allow some fish migration to continue.

Content Three general rules of legal liability are established by the Convention: #If a collision occurs that is accidental or of uncertain cause, the damages are borne by the party that suffers them; #If a collision occurs that is the fault of a party, the party at fault is liable for the damages that were caused; and #If a collision occurs that is the fault of more than one party, the parties at fault are liable in proportion to the faults respectively committed. (If it is not possible to determine the proportional fault, the liability is apportioned equally between the parties at fault.) The implementation of these rules abolished any pre-existing legal presumptions as to which party bore fault in maritime collisions. Creation and ratification The Convention was concluded at the Brussels Maritime Conference and signed by 24 states on 23 September 1910. It entered into force on 1 March 1913 and by the Second World War had been ratified by most of the major sea-faring nations. It remains in force for many states as the Convention that governs apportionment of fault in maritime collision cases. The states that signed the treaty but have not ratified it are the United States, Cuba, and Chile. The depositary of the Convention is the government of Belgium.

This can be caused by a physical barrier, such as other teeth, or when the tooth is angled away from a vertical position. Completely unerupted wisdom teeth usually result in no symptoms, although they can sometimes develop cysts or neoplasms. Partially erupted wisdom teeth can develop cavities or pericoronitis. Removal of impacted wisdom teeth is advised in the case of certain pathologies, such as nonrestorable caries or cysts. Wisdom teeth likely become impacted because of a mismatch between the size of the teeth and the size of the jaw. Impacted wisdom teeth are classified by their direction of impaction, their depth compared to the biting surface of adjacent teeth and the amount of the tooth's crown that extends through gum tissue or bone. Impacted wisdom teeth can also be classified by the presence or absence of symptoms and disease. Screening for the presence of wisdom teeth often begins in late adolescence when a partially developed tooth may become impacted. Screening commonly includes clinical examination as well as x-rays such as panoramic radiographs. Infection resulting from impacted wisdom teeth can be initially treated with antibiotics, local debridement or surgical removal of the gum overlying the tooth. Over time, most of these treatments tend to fail and patients develop recurrent symptoms. The most common treatment to recurrent pericoronitis is wisdom tooth removal. The risks of wisdom tooth removal are roughly proportional to the difficulty of the extraction. Sometimes, when there is a high risk to the inferior alveolar nerve, only the crown of the tooth will be removed (intentionally leaving the roots) in a procedure called a coronectomy. The long-term risk of coronectomy is that chronic infection can persist from the tooth remnants. The prognosis for the second molar is good following the wisdom teeth removal with the likelihood of bone loss after surgery increased when the extractions are completed in people who are 25 years of age or older. A treatment controversy exists about the need for and timing of the removal of disease-free impacted wisdom teeth. Supporters of early removal cite the increasing risks for extraction over time and the costs of monitoring the wisdom teeth. Supporters for retaining wisdom teeth cite the risk and cost of unnecessary surgery. The condition affects up to 72% of the Swedish population. Wisdom teeth have been described in the ancient texts of Plato and Hippocrates, the works of Darwin and in the earliest manuals of operative dentistry. It was the meeting of sterile technique, radiology and anaesthesia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that allowed the more routine management of impacted wisdom teeth. Video summary Classification All teeth are classified as either developing, erupted (into the mouth), embedded (failure to erupt despite lack of blockage from another tooth) or impacted. Impacted teeth are ones that fails to erupt due to blockage from other teeth. Wisdom teeth, as the last teeth to erupt in the mouth are the most likely to become impacted. They develop between the ages of 14 and 25, with 50% of root formation completed by age 16, and 95% of all teeth erupted by the age of 25, however, some tooth movement can continue beyond the age of 25. Impacted wisdom teeth are classified by the direction and depth of impaction, the amount of available space for tooth eruption, and the amount of soft tissue or bone (or both) that covers them. The classification structure helps clinicians estimate the risks for impaction, infections and complications associated with wisdom teeth removal. Wisdom teeth are also classified by the presence (or absence) of symptoms and disease. One review found that 11% of wisdom teeth will have evidence of disease and are symptomatic, 0.6% will be symptomatic but have no disease, 51% will be asymptomatic but have disease present and 37% will be asymptomatic and have no disease. Impacted wisdom teeth are often described by the direction of their impaction (forward tilting, or mesioangular being the most common), the depth of impaction and the age of the patient as well as other factors such as pre-existing infection or the presence of pathology (cysts, tumors or other disease). Each of these factors is used to predict the difficulty (and rate of complications) when removing an impacted tooth, with age being the most reliable predictor rather than the orientation of the impaction. Another classification system often taught in U.S. dental schools is known as Pell and Gregory Classification. This system includes a horizontal and vertical component to classify the location of third molars (predominately applicable to lower third molars): the third molar's relationship to the level of the teeth already in the mouth, being the vertical or x-component and to the anterior border of the ramus being the horizontal or y-component. Hupp, James R., et. al. Contemporary Maxillofacial Surgery, 6E, Elsevier-Mosby, 2014. Signs and symptoms Pericoronitis (green arrow) in lower right wisdom tooth Impacted wisdom teeth without a communication to the mouth, that have no pathology associated with the tooth, and have not caused tooth resorption on the blocking tooth, rarely have symptoms. The chances of developing pathology on an impacted wisdom tooth that is not communicating with the mouth is approximately 12%. However, when impacted wisdom teeth communicate with the mouth, food and bacteria penetrate to the space around the tooth and cause symptoms such as localized pain, swelling and bleeding of the tissue overlying the tooth. The tissue overlying the tooth is called the operculum, and the disorder is called pericoronitis which means inflammation around the crown of the tooth. Low grade chronic periodontitis commonly occurs on either the wisdom tooth or the second molar, causing less obvious symptoms such as bad breath and bleeding from the gums. The teeth can also remain asymptomatic (pain free), even with disease. The term asymptomatic means that the person has no symptoms. The term asymptomatic should not be equated with absence of disease. Most diseases have no symptoms early in the disease process. A pain-free or asymptomatic tooth can still be infected for many years before pain symptoms develop. Causes Wisdom teeth become impacted when there is not enough room in the jaws to allow for all of the teeth to erupt into the mouth. Because the wisdom teeth are the last to erupt, due to insufficient room in the jaws to accommodate more teeth, the wisdom teeth become stuck in the jaws, i.e., impacted. There is a genetic predisposition to tooth impaction. Genetics plays an important, albeit unpredictable role in dictating jaw and tooth size and tooth eruption potential of the teeth. Some also believe that there is an evolutionary decrease in jaw size due to softer modern diets that are more refined and less coarse than our ancestors'. Pathophysiology Impacted wisdom tooth with caries and cyst (green arrow) displacing inferior alveolar nerve (blue) Impactions completely covered by bone and soft tissue, do not communicate with the mouth, and have a low rate of clinically significant infection. Since the tooth never erupts, however, the dental follicle that surrounds the tooth does not degenerate during eruption, and can develop cysts or uncommon tumors over time. Estimates of the incidence of cysts or other neoplasms (almost all benign) around impacted teeth average at 3%, usually seen in people under the age of 40. This suggests that the chance of tumor formation decreases with age. Bacteroides fragilis bacteria under microscope For partially impacted teeth in those over 20 year of age, the most common pathology seen, and the most common reason for wisdom teeth removal, is pericoronitis or infection of the gum tissue over the impacted tooth. The bacteria associated with infections include Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium, and Bacteroides bacteria. The next most common pathology seen is cavities or tooth decay. Fifteen percent of people with retained wisdom teeth exposed to the mouth have cavities on the wisdom tooth or adjacent second molar due to a wisdom tooth. The rate of cavities on the back of the second molar has been reported anywhere from 1% to 19% with the wide variation attributed to increased age. In five percent of cases, advanced periodontitis or gum inflammation between the second and third molars precipitates the removal of wisdom teeth. Among patients with retained, asymptomatic wisdom teeth, roughly 25% have gum infections (periodontal disease). Teeth with periodontal pockets of greater than 5mm have tooth loss rates that start at 10 teeth lost per 1000 teeth per year at 5mm to a rate of 70 teeth lost per year per 1000 teeth at 11mm. The risk of periodontal disease and caries on third molars increases with age with a small minority (less than 2%) of adults age 65 years or older maintaining the teeth without caries or periodontal disease and 13% maintaining unimpacted wisdom teeth without caries or periodontal disease. Periodontal probing depths increase over time to greater than 4 mm in a significant proportion of young adults with retained impacted wisdom teeth which is associated with increases in serum inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6, soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 and C-reactive protein. Crowding of the front teeth is not believed to be caused by the eruption of wisdom teeth although this is a reason many dental clinicians use to justify wisdom teeth extraction., Diagnosis Panoramic radiograph of impacted lower wisdom teeth (green arrows) in a 26-year-old with dental caries (red arrows) on the adjacent teeth The diagnosis of impaction can be made clinically if enough of the wisdom tooth is visible to determine its angulation, depth, and if the patient is old enough that further eruption or uprighting is unlikely. Wisdom teeth continue to move to the age of 25 years old due to eruption, and then continue some later movement owing to periodontal disease. If the tooth cannot be assessed with clinical exam alone, the diagnosis is made using either a panoramic radiograph or cone-beam CT. Where unerupted wisdom teeth still have eruption potential several predictors are used to determine the chance of the teeth becoming impacted. The ratio of space between the tooth crown length and the amount of space available, the angle of the teeth compared to the other teeth are the two most commonly used predictors, with the space ratio being the most accurate. Despite the capacity for movement into early adulthood, the likelihood that the tooth will become impacted can be predicted when the ratio of space available to the length of the crown of the tooth is under 1. Screening Impacted 2nd molar (red arrow) with developing wisdom tooth (green arrow) There is no standard to screen for wisdom teeth. It has been suggested, absent evidence to support routinely retaining or removing wisdom teeth, that evaluation with panoramic radiograph, starting between the ages of 16 and 25 be completed every 3 years. Once there is the possibility of the teeth developing disease, then a discussion about the operative risks versus long-term risk of retention with an oral and maxillofacial surgeon or other clinician trained to evaluate wisdom teeth is recommended. These recommendations are based on expert opinion level evidence. Screening at a younger age may be required if the second molars (the \\"12-year molars\\") fail to erupt as ectopic positioning of the wisdom teeth can prevent their eruption. Radiographs can be avoided if the majority of the tooth is visible in the mouth. Treatment Wisdom teeth that are fully erupted and in normal function need no special attention and should be treated just like any other tooth. It is more challenging, however to make treatment decisions with asymptomatic, disease-free wisdom teeth where there is a high probability that the teeth will develop disease over time, but none exists on examination, or on x-rays (see Treatment controversy below). =Local treatment= An operculum (green arrow) over a partially erupted lower left third molar with inflammation and pus (right of green arrow under tissue) Pericoronitis is an infection of the operculum of a partially impacted wisdom tooth. It can be treated with local cleaning, an antiseptic rinse of the area and antibiotics if severe. Definitive treatment can be excision of the operculum, however, recurrence of these infections is high. Pericoronitis, while a small area of tissue, should be viewed with caution, because it lies near the anatomic planes of the neck and can progress to life-threatening neck infections. =Wisdom teeth removal= Wisdom teeth removal (extraction) is the most common treatment for impacted wisdom teeth. In the US, 10 million wisdom teeth are removed annually. The procedure can be either simple or surgical, depending on the depth of the impaction and angle of the tooth. Surgical removal is to create an incision in the mucosa of the mouth, remove bone of the mandible or maxilla adjacent the tooth, extract it or possibly section the tooth and extract it in pieces. This can be completed under local anaesthetic, sedation or general anaesthetic. Recovery, risks and complications Most people will experience pain and swelling (worst on the first post- operative day) then return to work after 2 to 3 days with the rate of discomfort decreased to about 25% by post-operative day 7 unless affected by dry socket: a disorder of wound healing that prolongs post-operative pain. It can be 4 to 6 weeks before patients are fully recovered with a full range of jaw movements. A Cochrane investigation found that the use of antibiotics either just before or just after surgery reduced the risk of infection, pain and dry socket after wisdom teeth are removed by oral surgeons, but that using antibiotics also causes more side effects for these patients. Twelve patients needed to receive antibiotics to prevent one infection and for every 21 people who received antibiotics, an adverse event was likely. The conclusion of the review was that antibiotics given to healthy people to prevent infections may cause more harm than benefit to both the individual patients and the population as a whole. Another Cochrane Investigation has found post-operative pain is effectively managed with either ibuprofen, or ibuprofen in combination with acetaminophen. Many variations to the surgical technique exist however; as of 2014 the evidence was insufficient to recommend one type of surgical practice over another. Long-term complications can include periodontal complications such as bone loss on the second molar following wisdom teeth removal. Bone loss as a complication after wisdom teeth removal is uncommon in the young but present in 43% of those of 25 years of age or older. Injury to the inferior alveolar nerve resulting in numbness or partial numbness of the lower lip and chin has reported rates that vary widely from 0.04% to 5%. The largest study is from a survey of 535 oral and maxillofacial surgeons in California, where a rate of 1:2,500 was reported. The large variation in report rates is attributed to variations in technique, the patient pool and surgeon experience. Other complications that are uncommon have been reported including persistent sinus communication, damage to adjacent teeth, lingual nerve injury, displaced teeth, osteomyelitis and jaw fracture. Alveolar osteitis, post-operative infection, excessive bleeding may also be expected. Treatment controversy Many impacted wisdom teeth are extracted prior to the age of 25, when full eruption can be reasonably expected and before symptoms or disease have begun. This has led to a treatment controversy generally referred to as the extraction of asymptomatic, disease-free wisdom teeth. In 2000, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) of the United Kingdom set guidelines to discontinue the removal of asymptomatic disease-free third molars in the UK National Health Service, stating that there was no reliable research evidence to support a health benefit to patients from the prophylactic removal of pathology-free impacted third molar teeth, in addition to the risks of removal and cost to the service. Advocates of the policy point out that the impacted wisdom teeth can be monitored and avoidance of surgery also means avoidance of the recovery, risks, complications and costs associated with it. Following implementation of the NICE guidelines the UK saw a decrease in the number of impacted third molar operations between 2000 and 2006 and a rise in the average age at extraction from 25 to 31 years. The American Public Health Association (APHA) has adopted a similar policy. Those who argue against a blanket moratorium on the extraction of asymptomatic, disease-free wisdom teeth point out that wisdom teeth commonly develop periodontal disease or cavities which may eventually damage the second molars and that there are costs associated with monitoring wisdom teeth. They also point to the fact that there is an increase in the rate of post-operative periodontal disease on the second molar, difficulty of surgery and post-operative recovery time with age. The UK has also seen an increase in the rate of dental caries on the lower second molars increasing from 4–5% prior to the NICE guideline to 19% after its adoption. Although most studies arrive at the conclusion of negative long-term outcomes e.g. increased pocketing and attachment loss after surgery, it is clear that early removal (before 25 years old), good post-operative hygiene and plaque control, and lack of pre-existing periodontal pathology before surgery are the most crucial factors that minimise the probability of adverse post-surgical outcomes. Asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth in 21-year-old The Cochrane review of surgical removal versus retention of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth suggests that the presence of asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth may be associated with increased risk of periodontal disease affecting adjacent 2nd molar (measured by distal probing depth > 4 mm on that tooth) in the long term. Few studies, however, met the criteria to be included in the Cochrane review and those that were included provided very low quality evidence and had a high risk of bias. Another study which was at high risk of bias, found no evidence to suggest that removal of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth has an effect on crowding in the dental arch. There is also insufficient evidence to highlight a difference in risk of decay with or without impacted wisdom teeth. One trial in adolescents who had orthodontic treatment comparing the removal of impacted lower wisdom teeth with retention was identified. It only examined the effect on late lower incisor crowding and was rated 'highly biased' by the authors. The authors concluded that there is not enough evidence to support either the routine removal or retention of asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth. Another randomised controlled trial done in the UK has suggested that it is not reasonable to remove asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom tooth merely to prevent incisor crowding as there is not strong enough evidence to show this association. Due to the lack of sufficient evidence to determine whether such teeth should be removed or not, the patient's preference and values should be taken into account with clinical expertise exercised and careful consideration of risks and benefits to determine treatment. If it is decided to retain asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth, clinical assessment at regular intervals is advisable to prevent undesirable outcomes (pericoronitis, root resorption, cyst formation, tumour formation, inflammation/infection). =Coronectomy= Coronectomy of impacted wisdom tooth post-op xray showing root remnants (red arrow) and inferior alveolar nerve (green arrow) Coronectomy is a procedure where the crown of the impacted wisdom tooth is removed, but the roots are intentionally left in place. It is indicated when there is no disease of the dental pulp or infection around the crown of the tooth, and there is a high risk of inferior alveolar nerve injury. Coronectomy, while lessening the immediate risk to the inferior alveolar nerve function has its own complication rates and can result in repeated surgeries. Between 2.3% and 38.3% of roots loosen during the procedure and need to be removed and up to 4.9% of cases require reoperation due to persistent pain, root exposure or persistent infection. The roots have also been reported to migrate in 13.2% to 85.9% of cases. Prognosis The prognosis for impacted wisdom teeth depends on the depth of the impaction. When they lack a communication to the mouth, the main risk is the chance of a cyst or neoplasm forming in the tissues around the tooth (such as the dental follicle), which is relatively uncommon. Once communicating with the mouth, the onset of disease or symptoms cannot be predicted but the chance of it does increase with age. Less than 2% of wisdom teeth are free of either periodontal disease or caries by age 65. Further, several studies have found that between 30% – 60% of people with previously asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth will have them extracted due to symptoms or disease, 4–12 years after initial examination. Extraction of the wisdom teeth removes the disease on the wisdom tooth itself and also appears to improve the periodontal status of the second molar, although this benefit diminishes beyond the age of 25. Epidemiology Few studies have looked at the percentage of the time wisdom teeth are present or the rate of wisdom teeth eruption. The lack of up to five teeth (excluding third molars, i.e. wisdom teeth) is termed hypodontia. Missing third molars occur in 9-30% of studied populations. One large scale study on a group of young adults in New Zealand showed 95.6% had at least 1 wisdom tooth with an eruption rate of 15% in the maxilla and 20% in the mandible. Another study on 5000 army recruits found 10,767 impacted wisdom teeth. The frequency of impacted lower third molars was found to be 72% in a Swedish study, and the frequency of retained impacted wisdom teeth that are free of disease and symptoms is estimated to be between 11.6% to 29%, a percentage which drops with age. The incidence of wisdom tooth removal was estimated to be 4 per 1000 person years in England and Wales prior to the 2000 NICE guidelines. History Farmer at the dentist, Johann Liss, c. 1616–17. Wisdom teeth have been described in the ancient texts of Plato and Hippocrates. \\"Teeth of wisdom\\" being from the Latin, dentes sapientiæ, which in turn is derived from the Hippocratic term, sophronisteres, from the Greek sophron, meaning prudent. Charles Darwin believed the wisdom teeth to be in decline with evolution which his contemporary, Paolo Mantegazza, later proved to be false when he discovered Darwin was not opening the jawbones of specimens to find the impacted tooth stuck in the jaw. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the collision of sterile technique, anaesthesia and radiology made routine surgery on the wisdom teeth possible. John Tomes's 1873 text A System of Dental Surgery describes techniques for removal of \\"third molars, or dentes sapientiæ\\" including descriptions of inferior alveolar nerve injury, jaw fracture and pupil dilation after opium is placed in the socket. Other texts from about this time speculate on their deevolution, that they are prone to decay and discussion on whether or not they lead to crowding of the other teeth.

It is dedicated to Lord Murugan, the Hindu war god and the son of the gods Shiva and his mother Pārvathi. The temple is also known as the Subramaniya Swāmi temple. The ancient temple was rebuilt in its present form in 1915 CE. The temple is one of the 21 major temples in Kānchipuram and is an important pilgrimage centre. Saint Aruna giri nādhar has sung hymns in praise of the Murugan icon of this temple. Location Rajagopura of the Kumarakottam Temple The Kumara kottam temple is located on the main Rāja Street. It is said to form a cluster with Ekāmbareswarar temple and the Kāmākshi Amman temple but each temple has its own liturgical identity. The Murugan temple is located between the temples of his parents – the Ekāmbareswarar temple dedicated to Shiva and the Kāmākshi Amman temple dedicated to Kāmākshi, an aspect of Pārvathi. Symbolically, this setting represents the iconography of Somāskandha, an aspect of Shiva where he is depicted with Murugan and Pārvathi. The child Murugan is depicted seated between his parents. This representation led to the cult of Somāskandha. All temples in Kānchipuram are stated to be dedicated to one extended family of gods. Religious significance The temple legend in the Kandha Purānam – the Tamil version of the Skanda Purāna which is mainly devoted to Murugan (also known as Skandha or Kandha) – states that Murugan had imprisoned the creator-god Brahmā here for the latter's ignorance of Om, the single syllable mantra which is sacred in Hinduism and himself assumed the role of the creator in this place. However, Murugan's father Shiva had ordered him to release Brahmā. When Murugan realized his mistake in not obeying his father’s instruction, he did penance before a Linga (the aniconic symbol of Shiva), which subsequently was worshipped by the name of Devasenāpathīsar, literally, the Lord who was worshipped by Devasenāpathi (an epithet of Murugan as the commander-in-chief of the gods). In another version it is said that the penitent Brahmā is said to have been released by Shiva after he worshipped Murugan after learning his lessons in humility. Features Dwaja sthamba (Flagpost) of the Kumarakottam Temple Side view of the Kumarakottam Temple The temple was rebuilt during 1915. It has the temple pinnacle (shikara) above the main sanctum (garbha griha), which is built in granite and is in the shape of a dome called the chakra vimānam (circular dome) which is a Chola period structure. The corbels and the pilasters with epigraphs decorate the walls of the temple. The temple has two prakārams (circumambulatory passages) and many parivāra devatās (family deities) are installed in subshrines around it. The central image of Murugan is uniquely depicted as Brahma-Shāstā, holding a kamandalu (water pot) and prayer beads of Rudrāksha. The linga worshipped by Murugan is deified in a separate shrine within the temple complex and is called Devasenāpathīsar or Senāpathi Ishvara. Kandha Purānam Mantapam (Hall) in the Kumarakottam Temple complex where the epic Kandha Purānam was released Kacchiyappar (Kacchiyappa Shiva āchāriyār), a Tamil scholar, was a priest in the Kumara kottam temple. He composed the text Kandha Purānam. The hall, the Kandhapurāna Arangetra Mantapam (An outdoor pavilion) where Kacchiyappar composed the text still exists in the temple complex. Peacocks flock the premises even now.Kacchiyappar wrote the epic in six cantos, comprising 10,346 stanzas. It is believed that the first line of the first stanza was written by Kacchiyappar's patron deity, Murugan himself. The god is also believed to have corrected the 100 stanzas written by the priest during the day. The poet took his composition to the god and rehearsed it. Even now the priests in the temple are the descendants of Kacchiyappar. Festivals A popular festival held here is Kandha Shashti (in November), 6th day of waxing (brightening) half of the lunar month Kārtthigai, named after Murugan, also known as Skandha (Kandhan in Tamil). During the month of Kārtthigai (November–December) between the darker (waning) half and the brighter (waxing) half of Moon, celebrations are held in the temple when a very large number of lamps are lit in the temple. The worship in the temple is scheduled six times daily. In every lunar month on the days of the rising star of Kirutthigai (as per Hindu Calendar) festival is held in the temple when very large number of devotees offer prayers to the deity. Each temple in Kānchipuram celebrates the Brahmā festival, as Brahmotsavam, when processions of gods are held in the morning and evening hours.

He also served previously in the Arizona House of Representatives, serving as assistant minority leader there as well. He is a member of the Democratic Party. On June 5, 2017, Farley announced he was running for Governor of Arizona in the 2018 election, challenging Republican incumbent Governor Doug Ducey, but lost in the Democratic primary. He unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic nomination in the 2019 Tucson mayoral election. Early life and education Farley was born in Upland, California to two public school teachers. As a teenager, Farley heard stories of how administrators at his mother's school micromanaged teachers and exerted unnecessarily strong control over classrooms, so he went to the local papers attempting to expose the injustice in his school system. The reporter didn't feel like running with the story. He graduated from Williams College in 1985 with a degree in political science. Career Farley began his foray into politics as a citizen advocate for increased investment in public transportation, and aided in the approval of the comprehensive regional transportation system which created Pima County's Regional Transportation Authority. Farley was elected to the Arizona House of Representatives in 2006, and became the assistant minority leader in 2010. In 2011, he proposed a controversial 300% tax hike on all medical marijuana sold in Arizona, but his bill did not become law. In 2012, he was elected to the Arizona Senate. Farley served on the Finance, Appropriations, and Joint Legislative Budget committees where he oversaw the $10 billion state budget. He has also served on the Ethics, Government and Environment, and Transportation committees. He was Senate Assistant Minority Leader and the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee. In 2012, Farley campaigned on issues like investing in new technologies and high-wage jobs, expanding health care for self-employed and small-business owners and making long-term care more affordable for middle-class seniors, in addition to his work in increasing the production of clean solar energy, outlawing driving while texting and protecting Tucson's sovereignty. Farley opposed the controversial Arizona SB 1070 and worked with Governor Jan Brewer to expand Medicaid, bringing healthcare to 400,000 Arizonans. During Farley's last term in the Arizona Senate, he was one of the key Democratic lawmakers who helped the Red4Ed movement gain steam and bring forth a $415 million increased investment in Arizona public schools and a 20% pay increase for teachers. During his time in the state legislature, Farley put out a weekly Farley Report to inform his constituents on the inner workings of state government. His lengthy blog posts helped explain obscure and complex policies and kept Arizonans up-to-date on state issues. On June 5, 2017, Farley announced his campaign for Governor of Arizona against incumbent Republican Governor Doug Ducey. Farley lost the Democratic primary to David Garcia. In the campaign, Farley played towards his comprehensive knowledge of the state budget and sold himself as a policy wonk. He proposed closing tax loopholes to secure greater funding for public education, saying \\"I know we have the money, we've just chosen to give it away,\\" and criticized the Arizona economy for benefiting those at the top more than the average Arizonan. On January 10, 2019, Farley announced his candidacy for the 2019 Tucson mayoral election. He campaigned on a platform focused on economic development, environmental preparedness, and investment in education and public transportation. He has proposed creating a public healthcare option for Tucson residents, switching diesel engine buses to electrical engines powered by solar energy, creating a resiliency plan for extreme climate emergencies, and preparing Tucson's economy to be competitive in emerging industries. In the Democratic primary, Farley came in second place after incumbent mayor, Regina Romero. Personal life Farley is also a prominent artist, whose work appears throughout Tucson, including the iconic ceramic tile mural by the Broadway Underpass, at the eastern gateway to downtown Tucson. Farley developed a method for converting photographs to ceramic tiles, which has led to him working on several similar projects throughout the country. Farley is engaged to Kitt Leonard, an IT specialist at the Tucson Medical Center, and has two children.

He is the only known brother of Vazul, a rebellious duke who was blinded on the order of their cousin, King Saint Stephen I of Hungary in 1031 or 1032. Medieval chroniclers, in their effort to conceal that the Kings of Hungary were descended from a prince condemned by the saintly first king, wrote that instead of Vazul, Ladislas was the Hungarian monarchs' forefather. Ján Steinhübel and other modern Slovak historians write that he was Duke of Nyitra under Polish suzerainty, but this theory has not been universally accepted by historians. Life Ladislas was a son of Michael, who was the younger son of Grand Prince Taksony. According to Hungarian historians, including Gyula Kristó, he was the younger of Michael's two sons. On the other hand, Steinhübel and other Slovak scholars write his brother, Vazul was younger than him. Their mother's name is unknown. György Györffy writes that she \\"may have been\\" related to Samuel of Bulgaria, because her two sons' name was popular in Samuel's family. Györffy also writes that neither Ladislas nor his brother, both still minors, were in the position to hold administrative functions when their father died sometime before 997. In contrast with this view, Vladimir Segeš writes that their uncle, Grand Prince Géza appointed Ladislas to administer the \\"Duchy of Nitra\\" soon after their father was murdered, around 977, on the same grand prince's orders. Segeš adds that Géza dismissed Ladislas in favor of his own son, Stephen in 995, but the latter, when succeeded Géza as grand prince in 997, again granted the duchy to Ladislas. A third view is presented by Steinhübel. He writes that Ladislas the Bald only became the duke of Nitra after Boleslav the Brave, Duke of Poland occupied large territories to the north of the river Danube in 1001 from Stephen, who had in the meantime been crowned the first king of Hungary. Segeš likewise writes that Ladislas administered for the second time the Duchy of Nitra under Polish suzerainty in the early 11th century. On the other hand, the theory that large territories to the north of the Danube were under Polish suzerainty in the early 11th centurywhich is only based on a late source, the Polish- Hungarian Chronicleis sharply criticized by Györffy. He writes that the \\"Duchy of Nitra\\" was administered by one of King Stephen's henchmen, Hont in this period. Whether Ladislas died as a vassal of Boleslaus the Brave or of Stephen I is debated even by Slovak historians. According to Segeš, he only died after the Poles withdrew from the Duchy of Nitra in 1018, and upon his death his brother, Vazul succeeded him as King Stephen's vassal. On the other hand, Steinhübel says that Ladislas was still Boleslaus the Brave's vassal when he died and his brother succeeded him sometime before 1030. Family The Illuminated Chronicle writes that he took \\"his wife from Ruthenia\\".The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle: (ch. 60.87), p. 113. Based on this report, the Hungarian historian, Gyula Kristó says that she was a member of the Rurik dynasty of the Kievan Rus'. He adds that her name was possibly Premislava. According to many Hungarian chronicles, Ladislas was the forefather of the kings of Hungary reigning after 1046, because he fathered three sons, including, Kings Andrew I and Béla I of Hungary. However, other sources, including the Chronicle of Zagreb and a Legend of Saint Gerard, preserved the tradition that their father was actually Vazul. Both Györffy and Steinhübel write that Ladislas the Bald has a son, but his name was Bonuzlo, according to the former, and Domoslav, according to the latter. The following family tree presents Vazul's ancestry and his offspring. (a) Whether Menumorut is an actual or an invented person is debated by modern scholars. (b) A Khazar, Pecheneg or Volga Bulgarian lady. (c) Györffy writes that she may have been a member of the Bulgarian Cometopuli dynasty. (d) Kristó writes that she may have been a member of the Rurik dynasty from Kievan Rus'. (e) Many Hungarian chronicles write that Levente, Andrew and Béla were Ladislas the Bald's sons, but the reliability of this report is dubious according to modern historians.

In 1773 he commenced publishing his own works, and in 1778 went into partnership with Thomas Watson, who engraved in both stipple and mezzotint, and who died in 1781.

Biography  Radovanović was born on 2 August 1900, in the village of Marići near the town of Medveđa in southern Kingdom of Serbia. At the age of fourteen he volunteered for service in World War I and joined a komit unit led by Kosta Vojinović. In early October 1915 , he was wounded while fighting Bulgarian troops, before taking part in the Serbian army's retreat through Albania in the winter of 1915, and the Salonika Front offensive in September 1918. After the war, in January 1919, he was called up for compulsory military service in the Royal Yugoslav Army and served 18 months in a King's Guard unit in Belgrade during the reign of King Peter I. As a World War I volunteer, he was later awarded a five hectare plot of land near Uroševac in southern Kosovo by King Alexander I. In 1932 he became a member of the Yugoslav gendarmerie and was stationed in a series of cities around Kingdom of Yugoslavia, including Priština, Split, Mostar, Peć and Prizren. During the outbreak of World War II and the 1941 invasion of Yugoslavia he was in Prizren, where he joined the Yugoslav Partisans. He was wounded and captured by Bulgarian troops, and by the end of the war he rose to the rank of major. Apart from Aleksa, his two brothers were also volunteers in both world wars - his older brother Radivoj was executed by a German firing squad in Prokuplje and his younger brother Radovan was shot by Germans in Uroševac. Radivoj's son Milisav also joined the Partisans in 1941.

She contributed much to gaining it full college status within the University of Oxford and to expanding its library. She also wrote books about cookery. Life Maitland was born on 12 April 1850 at 12 Gloucester Terrace, Hyde Park, the second daughter of David John Maitland of Chipperkyle, Galloway, and Matilda Leathes Mortlock. Her father settled as a merchant in Liverpool when she was five years old, and she was educated at home there in a Presbyterian atmosphere. In 1875 she published \\"Elsie\\" under the name \\"A. C. M.\\". Between 1880 and 1885, Maitland studied cookery at the domestic science training school in Liverpool, and from 1885 to 1889 acted as an examiner in cookery at elementary schools, and of teachers trained by the Northern Union of Schools of Cookery. She was soon recognised as an authority on domestic economy. She wrote several cookery books, of which the most important are The Rudiments of Cookery : a Manual for Use in Schools and Homes (1883), the Afternoon Tea Book (1887) and What Shall We Have for Breakfast? (1889). She also published between 1875 and 1889 some educational novels and tales suitable for young girls. Maitland was keenly interested in the higher education of women and left Liverpool in 1889 to succeed Madeleine Shaw Lefevre as Principal of Somerville Hall, Oxford. Her experience of public work and talent for administration and organisation proved of value there. Somerville had been founded in 1879 and incorporated as a college in 1881, although it retained the style \\"Hall\\" until 1894. Maitland employed an ex- student, Alice Bruce, as her secretary, although she would take on various jobs at Somerville.Evans, W. (2004-09-23). Bruce, Alice Moore (1867–1951), educationist. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Retrieved 2 Feb. 2018, See link During Maitland's tenure as Principal, the number of students rose from 35 to 86 and the buildings were extended accordingly. She developed the tutorial system, with a view to making Somerville a genuine college and no mere hall of residence, and she urged the students to take the full degree course, so as to prove their entitlement to degrees, which were still confined to men. Maitland was something of an autocrat, but handled her staff and students well and showed faith in democratic principles. On her initiative, a proportion of the Council were elected by duly qualified old students. A strong liberal in politics, and a broad-minded churchwoman (in spite of her Presbyterian training), she preserved the non-denominational atmosphere at the college. To Maitland the college owes the erection of its library of 15,000 volumes, which was opened in 1894 by John Morley. At Morley's suggestion, Helen Taylor presented Somerville with the library of John Stuart Mill, free of conditions. Maitland died after some two years' illness on 19 August 1906, at 12 Norham Road, Oxford, and was buried in Holywell Cemetery, Oxford.

The decoration was authorized by Act of the United States Congress, February 14, 1931, for presentation by the President of the United States, but not in the name of the Congress. The medal was intended to recognize any person who, while serving as a pilot in the airmail service, distinguished themselves by acts of heroism or extraordinary achievement. Retroactive to May 15, 1918 when the firsts continuously schedule public service airmail route was established between Washington, D.C. and New York City by way of Philadelphia. Recommendations for the individual awards would come from the Postmaster General and be sent to the President for his approval and presentation. The medal was designed by Walker Kirtland Hancock, head of the sculptor department of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, under the United States Commission of Fine Arts, of which Adolph Alexander Weinman was a member at the time. The medal was struck by the Philadelphia Mint.  Description and Symbolism  = Obverse = On the front of the 1 ¼ inch bronze medal is a figure of a nude male wearing an aviators leather helmet and goggles, trudging on tip toes atop a layer of clouds and in front of a single lightning bolt while clutching a sack of mail with both hands, to his right side. Around this scene and along the edges circumference are the words \\"AIR MAIL FLYERS'S MEDAL OF HONOR\\". Just below the shins of the male figure are the letters \\"WH\\" being the initials of the artist responsible for designing the medal. = Reverse = On the reverse side of the 1 ¼ inch bronze medal the entire edge circumference is decorated with a wreath of laurel leaves. Within the edged border of laurel leaves there is a blank space for engraving the recipients name. Above which are the three lines \\"PRESENTED / BY THE PRESIDENT / OF THE UNITED STATES\\".

(**) Presented by Postmaster General Jesse M. Donaldson, on behalf of President Truman.  Citations  = Mal Bryan Freeburg = Mal Freeburg, flying for Northwest Airways at time of presentation, was cited as follows: On April 12, Pilot Freeburg, with co-pilot Joe Kimm, departed from St. Paul, Minn., at 3 p.m. en route to Chicago. The plane carried 8 passengers, 6 men and 2 women, besides a load of mail. The plane made its regular stop at Minneapolis at 3:09 p.m. and left at 3:15 p.m. en route to Chicago via Milwaukee. Approximately 45 minutes later, while flying at an altitude of about 2,000 feet in ideal weather, with everything functioning perfectly, the pilot suddenly experienced a terrific jolt. A glance showed that the left outboard motor was vibrating terribly, due to a portion of the propeller having let go. While in the act of cutting the switch, the motor broke loose from its mounting and the pilot, not knowing for the moment what its effect would be on the other motors, cut all the switches and then investigated further. He found that the motor had lodged on the left landing gear struts. Again Freeburg switched on the other two motors and still had an altitude of about 1800 feet. The plane was operating very well considering the additional resistance caused by the motor shell still being in place with a large opening remaining, due to the loss of the motor. Pilot Freeburg stated that his next thought was to get rid of the motor, but as he was flying over a farming district he was apprehensive that it might land on a dwelling. As a result, the course was altered and the ship pointed its nose over the Mississippi River. Freeburg intended to shake the motor off the landing gear and drop it into the river, if possible. On approaching a fair sized island in the river he succeeded in maneuvering the plane so that the motor fell off. The pilot then turned the plane around and proceeded to the Wabasha emergency landing field, about 235 miles east. The damage to the landing wheel was such that the wheel would not revolve and the tier was cut open. But a safe landing was made without any further damage. The incident had already been reported to the operating headquarters at St. Paul by radio at the time of occurrence and a relief ship was immediately dispatched to Wabasha where pilots Freeburg and Kimm transferred their passengers and mail and continued the trip to Chicago. One of the distinguished features of this occurrence is the fact that during all of this time, Pilot Freeburg was talking into his radio phone, advising St. Paul of what had happened and outlining what he was attempting to do. (Because there was only a short delay in the flight, it was not recorded as an interrupted flight.) = Edward Antoine Bellande = Edward Antoine Bellande, flying for United Airlines at time of presentation, was cited as follows: For extraordinary achievement while piloting air mail plane No. NC 9666 on a flight from San Francisco to Los Angeles, Calif., on the night of February 10, 1933. About 17 miles from Bakersfield, Calif., fire started in the plywood floor between passenger seats five and six. Co-pilot Lynn Berkenkamp made every effort to extinguish the flames and succeeded in keeping them from the cabin by using cushions from the chairs. In the meantime, Pilot Bellande speeded the plane to the Bakersfield Airport and landed it as soon as possible. After the landing the pilot and co- pilot gave immediate attention to the safety of the passengers. Six were removed without injury and the seventh and last was slightly burned. The plane was completely destroyed but most of the mail was saved. = James Henry Carmichael, Jr. = James Henry Carmichael, Jr., flying for Central Airlines at time of presentation, was cited as follows: For extraordinary achievement while piloting air mail plane No. 408H on April 21, 1933, during a night flight from Washington, D.C. to Detroit, Mich. At an altitude of 3200 feet and about half way to Pittsburgh, PA., with no warning whatsoever the left outboard engine of the tri-motored plane crashed from the ship. Pilot Carmichael adjusted the controls to return the plane to a level position and turned back to Washington. In breaking from the ship the left engine had pulled the outboard heater control open and effected the center engine altitude adjustment. The center engine cut out until the altitude control was discovered and readjusted. Realizing that he had about 100 miles to fly in returning to Washington, the pilot climbed to an altitude of 4500 feet in order not to overheat the remaining two engines on the plane. A survey of the damage was made from the cockpit window with the aid of a flashlight, from which it was determined that the landing gear had been damaged. The pilot, therefore, decided that a landing should be made at Bolling Field, which is larger than the Washington Airport, and would be more advantageous for the one-wheel type of landing which would have to be made with damaged landing gear. He also desired to avail himself of the trained Army personnel and their emergency equipment, including ambulances and fire trucks. The pilot made all arrangements for landing by radio communication and received the fullest cooperation from the Bolling Field authorities. A one-wheel landing was made with little additional damage to the ship and no injury to passengers and mail. = Gordon Sprigg Darnell = Gordon Sprigg Darnell, flying for Braniff Airlines at time of presentation, was cited as follows: For extraordinary achievement while piloting air mail plane No.e NC 9489 on a flight from Kansas City, Mo. To Denver, Colo., on June 28, 1933. Near Goodland, Kansas, at an altitude of about 2,000 feet, Pilot Darnell smelled gasoline fumes. Fire followed immediately, breaking through the lower left side of the cockpit. The throttle, switch and right hand tank were closed, but the left hand tank valve could not be closed because it was in flames. The flame in the cockpit was smothered by a hand extinguisher. Fumes almost rendered the pilot and passengers unconscious, but the pilot opened the cockpit windows and put the ship in a nose-high side slip, which partly cleared the fumes and kept most of the flames from the cockpit. A normal landing was made but fire flamed again in the cockpit before the ship came to a stop. Passengers were notified to prepare to leave the plane. Pilot Darnell climbed through the front exit and rode the wing struts until the plane stopped. Passengers were removed without injury. All mail except that in the cockpit was saved. The left gas tank burned out and the right exploded. The plane was a complete loss. = Wellington Porter McFail = Wellington Porter McFail, flying for American Airlines at time of presentation, was cited as follows: For extraordinary achievement while piloting air mail plane No. NC 12285 on a flight from Texarkana to Dallas, Texas, on the afternoon of December 6, 1933. Pilot McFail left Texarkana at 1:10 p.m. and shortly after 1:50 p.m., while flying at an altitude of 5900 feet, a slight motor vibration was noted, followed later by a rending crash and jar, as the motor ripped loose from the plane. Pilot McFail's head and body were forced to his knees as the plane was immediately whipped up in a vertical climb to about 6500 feet as a result of the loss of the weight of the motor. He could not open his eyes for the moment but on regaining muscular control he noted the plane had reached the peak of its climb and was falling off to the right. It went into a half turn with tail down and right wing pointed down. The pilot felt pressure on the controls and righted the ship into a dive. He unbuckled his belt to jump but realizing that he had some control over the plane he decided that he could land it with a good chance of not hurting the ship or himself. He remembered that there was an emergency landing field in the vicinity and re-buckled his belt, determined to land the plane in the field if possible. Relying on his experience with a glider, he maneuvered a figure S and brought the plane to a landing, without further damage to the plane or to himself and with no damage to the mail. = Lewis Summers Turner = Lewis Summers Turner, flying for Bowen Airlines at time of presentation, was cited as follows: For extraordinary achievement while piloting air mail plane No. NC 732 N on a flight from Fort Worth to Amarillo, Texas, on the night of March 16, 1933. On the take-off from Fort Worth, while at an altitude of approximately 150 feet, the plane burst into flames and was almost instantly a mass of fire from propeller to rudder. Pilot Turner turned abruptly down wind to avoid landing on houses and other obstructions and landed at the airport from which he took off. The heat in the cabin was so intense the passengers leaped from the plane immediately after it landed and before it came to a stop. Although burned and injured both were saved. Pilot Turner did not leave the plane until after it had stopped. He attempted to make an exit from the top door of the cockpit but was prevented from doing so by flames. Although the wings were burning he jumped through the side door of the cockpit. His hands, forehead and ears were burned and his ankle sprained from the jump. He immediately turned his attention to the passengers until he saw that they had jumped. Most of the mail was recovered and salvaged. = Grover Clinton Tyler = Grover Clinton Tyler, flying for United Airlines at time of presentation, was cited as follows: For extraordinary achievement while piloting air mail plane No. C-741 on the night of March 2, 1931, on a flight from Seattle, Wash. To San Diego, Calif. when about nine miles south of Glide, Oregon, about 11 p.m., Pilot Tyler discovered that smoke was coming from the underside of the plane in the vicinity of the mail compartment. The smoke was almost immediately followed by flames. The plane at the time was over a mountainous region and the nearest clearing the pilot remembered was in the vicinity of Glide. He returned to it and landed the plane in a clump of small pliant trees. The wings were caught by the trees and were torn from the body of the plane. This served to break the force of the landing so that the passengers were not seriously injured. One passenger received a few cuts about the face and another burned his hands slightly in handling a hot fire extinguisher. Pilot Tyler helped the passengers from the plane and with their assistance removed the mall load of 319 pounds from the plane. The burning pouches were thrown into the swampy ground which extinguished the fire and saved the mail except for charred edges and water damage. The fire in the mail compartment of the plane was then quenched with fire extinguishers and the water in the swampy area in which the plane landed. = Roy Herbert Warner = Roy H Warner, flying for United Airlines at time of presentation, was cited as follows: For extraordinary achievement while piloting an air mail plane on the night of August 22, 1930, on a flight from Boise, Idaho, en route to Pasco, Washington. Near Baker, Oregon, while flying at an altitude of about 7500 feet, Pilot Warner felt gasoline spraying against his face and immediately headed for an emergency landing field. Realizing that if he throttled his motor a backfire might ignite the gasoline fumes, he attempted a steep power dive. The fumes came back into his face, however, causing nausea and strangulation, making a side slip necessary. When the landing lights flashed on the ground, he cut his motor to land and the plane burst into flames. With his trousers afire and his right hand burning from handling the \\"stick,\\" Pilot Warner continued to control the plane, but when the fabric burned off the right wing the ship went into a spin and landed on one wing, bounced into the air and hit again right side up. Pilot Warner climbed out of the flame enveloped cockpit and jumped clear of the fire and smoke to get fresh air. Nearly suffocated and sick from nausea, Pilot Warner thought of the mail, returned to the burning plane, opened the door, removed and threw all of the mail to safety. He completed the task and ran from the ship only a few second before the gasoline tanks exploded. = Theodore Nieman Kincannon = Theodore \\"Ted\\" Nieman Kincannon, flying for American Airlines, was cited as follows: For extraordinary achievement while piloting air mail plane No. NC-13767 on a flight from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, to Dallas, Texas, on January 29, 1936. Despite the fact that the weather reports indicated that the trip could be made, Pilot Kincannon encountered snow and later icing conditions. Ice formation on the carburetor reduced engine efficiency, necessitating a forced landing. Reports of the passengers indicate that under these trying circumstances, Pilot Kincannond did not become excited. He flashed the electric sign warning all passengers to fasten their seat belts and selected the best available place for landing. Most of the reports indicate that Pilot Kincannon deliberately selected a small clump of trees which could be utilized to break the fall, and maneuvered the plane so that the shock of the landing was absorbed by the front end of the fuselage and the left wing, thus protecting the passengers and mail compartments even though it would endanger him in his location in the front cockpit where the impact would be greatest. None of the five passengers on the plane which was a single-motor type, was injured seriously. Pilot Kincannon, however, was fatally injured. (Award was received posthumously by his widow) = John David Hissong = John David Hissong, flying for Eastern Airlines at time of presentation, was cited s follows: For extraordinary valor and achievement while piloting air mail plane No. NC 13735 on a flight from New Orleans to New York on the night of October 18, 1938. Soon after takeoff from the intermediate stop at Montgomery, Alabama, for flight to Atlanta, Georgia, extreme vibrations set up in the right engine and there was progressive failure of its component parts. Fire of intense heat from escaping gasoline and oil enveloped the engine and right wing and progressed toward the cabin. The engine burned from its fittings and dropped from the plane. The pilot, with great skill and courage, manipulated the controls to compensate for loss of engine and burning wing, kept the plane aloft until dwellings were cleared, and then landed in the darkness and without landing gear in such manner that, although the burning wing was sheared off by contact with a tree, there was no impact. The passengers were freed from the plane a few second before it was entirely consumed. Besides three members of the plane crew, there were eleven passengers who earnestly say that they are indebted for their lives to the courage of Pilot Hissong, who alone was injured by minor burns.

The LAE seeks to investigate and understand the many aspects of the eugenics movement in western Canada. The project began in 2009 and is funded by a grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. The Beginnings of the LAE In the mid-20th century, western Canada was a hotbed for eugenics practices as evidenced in particular by the sexual sterilization policies and laws in Alberta and British Columbia. Both provinces conducted the sexual sterilizations of those deemed mentally or developmentally ‘defective’ in some way. As Professor Wilson notes, given the perceived need for \\"hardy individuals\\" in the west at the time, “the idea may have been that we needed the best stock we can produce. If we don’t we will perish.” Wilson further explains that the “typical grounds for eugenic sterilization were that a person’s undesirable physical or mental conditions were heritable, and that those persons would not make suitable parents. Central among those targeted by such eugenic practices were people with a variety of disabilities, […] single mothers, First Nations and Metis people, eastern Europeans, and the poor.” In Alberta, roughly 2,800 were performed under its 1928 Sexual Sterilization Act before it was repealed in 1972. British Columbia's Sexual Sterilization Act, enacted in 1933, was ultimately repealed in 1973. Rob Wilson is a professor of philosophy at the University of Alberta and is the LAE principal investigator. Wilson also coordinates the ‘What Sorts Network’ which is a network of scholars devoted to exploring ideas related to the question “what sorts of people should there be?” through collaboration on research projects and scholarly events. Wilson's interest in eugenics specifically in Western Canada took shape when “in 2001, several students spoke to him about the[ir] relatives who had been institutionalized and sterilized”.Borowiecki 2011 As Wilson exclaims, “I was stunned. It was so close to home”.Borowiecki 2011 From this, more interest was garnered to delve into further specific work on eugenics practices in Western Canada, especially given that there were still many survivors of sexual sterilization in Alberta.Leung, p. 151 Out of this came LAE. SSHRC Grant and LAE’s Projects In 2010, Professor Wilson was awarded a grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) for his project entitled “Living Archives on Eugenics in Western Canada” in the form of a Community-University Research Alliance (CURA) grant.Brown 2010 The CURA grant supports research alliances between post- secondary institutions and various community and voluntary organizations. Given the intense personal nature of the subject matter that the LAE engages in, partnerships with community organizations that have been involved in supporting the victims of eugenics as well as advocating for justice on their behalf are integral to LAE's success. As Wilson notes, the mission of LAE is to “create innovative academic resources for scholars across many academic fields, but its true value lies in how it actively involves community organizations and vulnerable individuals whose stories have most often been left out of what we might call the ‘Canadian collective memory.\\" Brown 2010 The three major components of the CURA include a research component, education/training component, and a knowledge-mobilization component, all of which must “meet the needs of the research institutions and its community partners.\\" The LAE undertakes various projects that engage these components with a view toward the guiding objective of preserving the “Canadian collective memory” of eugenics practices in Western Canada in order to bring new light and perspectives on this part of its history. LAE's projects include (1) a more thorough, complete, and systematic archival collection that is accessible to the public as well as scholars from various fields;Leung, p. 152Borowiecki 2011 (2) the recording and archiving of oral histories told by eugenics survivors regarding their personal recollections of being institutionalized and sterilized;Leung, p. 152, 155 (3) the creation of an interactive website that is accessible to the public;Leung, p. 152Borowiecki 2011 (4) and developing high-school and university level curricula for the various disciplines that engage in the history of eugenics in Western Canada;Borowiecki 2011Leung, p. 152Brown 2010 Given the goal of preserving the personal stories of eugenics survivors, archiving the oral testimonies of sterilization survivors is one of the major projects of LAE. Leilani Muir, the first sterilization survivor to successfully sue the province of Alberta for wrongful sterilization under the Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta, has partnered with LAE, serving on its governing board, and has also provided her personal account of being institutionalized and sterilized for LAE's archives. For Muir, involvement with the LAE helps to fulfill a personal mission: “We’ve got to make sure this never happens again because my attitude is if I don’t talk about this and keep it out of the forefront, history will repeat itself in some way because history always does repeat.\\"CBC 2010 For Professor Wilson, having the support and involvement of sterilization survivors and their families is essential to the success of LAE, “and not just to have them at arm’s length to the project but to really make them integral to what we’re doing – providing oral histories and telling their stories and having a voice.\\"CBC 2010 Alberta Eugenics Awareness Week One of the annual highlights of the work conducted by LAE is Alberta Eugenics Awareness Week (AEW). First held in October 2011, these weeks have included a plethora of events that are designed to engage reflection and discussion regarding eugenics in Western Canada through various mediums. Each AEAW has also been honoured by Edmonton Mayor Stephen Mandel's proclamations of those weeks as the official 'Alberta Eugenics Awareness Week' in the city of Edmonton. The 2011 Awareness Week included an art exhibit entitled ‘The Collective Memory Project: Responses to Eugenics in Alberta’ which featured “more than 20 contemporary works ranging from acrylics, digital prints and collages to pencil sketches, transfers, and archival photos” by “12 visual artists from across the country.\\"Borowiecki 2011 Also during the 2011 awareness week was included a public screening and discussion of The Sterilization of Leilani Muir, a documentary based on the personal experience of Leilani Muir. Other events held during the week include lectures, discussion groups, dramatic performances, research presentations, and public talks.CURA 2012 Mid Term Report During the 2012 Awareness Week, events included panel discussions about eugenics and marginalized groups, a celebration of the 40th anniversary of the repeal of the Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta, and a performance of the play \\"Invisible Child\\" based on the life of Leilani Muir.CURA 2012 Mid Term Report LAE Alliances The LAE is partnered by many institutions, organizations, and individuals.CURA 2012 Mid Term Report = Postsecondary Institutions= *University of Alberta and its Department of Philosophy, Faculty of Extension, Arts Research Centre, Humanities Computing, Office of the Dean of the Faculty of Arts, and the John Dossetor Health Ethics Centre. *University of Calgary and its Community Rehabilitation and Disability Studies Program, Community Health Services. *University of Guelph *University of Saskatchewan and its Department of History and Vice-President of Research. *University of Lethbridge *York University’s Office of the Vice President of Research and Innovation =Community Organizations= *Alberta Association of Community Living *Neighborhood Bridges *Field Law *Maa and Paa Theatre *Edmonton Public Library *Provincial Archives of Alberta *Legal Archives Society of Alberta *Silversky Solutions *Alberta Public Interest Research Interest Group *NeWest *American Association of People with Disabilities =Individual Partners= *Allan Garber, Parlee McLaws LLP. *Judy Lytton, Sterilization Survivor, Activist.

NORC at the University of Chicago, then known as the National Opinion Research Center, developed the sample design and performed the data collection for the study. The study surveyed students from 1,015 public and private high schools on their cognitive and non-cognitive skills, high school experiences, work experiences, and future plans. Baseline surveys were administered in 1980, with follow-up surveys in 1982, 1984, 1986, 1992, 2014, and 2015. An additional follow-up study is underway. Researchers at the University of Minnesota, the University of Wisconsin, and the Population Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin are working in collaboration with NORC to continue to build this time series dataset with the endorsement of NCES. In 2019, the National Institute on Aging awarded a grant to re-contact the members of the original 1980 sophomore and senior classes.  The origins/historical context  The HS&B; was designed and collected with funding from the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) as part of their National Education Longitudinal Studies program to document the “educational, vocational, and personal development of young people… following them over time as they begin to take on adult roles and responsibilities”. NORC at the University of Chicago collected the surveys. Noted sociologist James Samuel Coleman led the design team for the initial study. James S. Coleman’s work has had “a far-reaching impact on government education policy”. In his writings on Coleman, Peter Marsden notes that “Coleman made influential contributions that range across the sociology of education, policy research, mathematical sociology, network/structural analysis, and sociological theory” and “ranks among the most influential sociologists of the twentieth century.” HS&B; respondents occupy an important position at the end of the Baby Boom. They are the first post-Civil Rights cohort; they are the first cohort in which women's educational attainments exceeded those of men; they are the first in recent history in which it was normative for women to experience uninterrupted labor force participation; and they are among the first cohorts to confront the insecurity and loss of the generous pensions and affordable health insurance they experienced and expected when they began their careers. The HS&B; cohort is more racially and ethnically diverse than earlier contemporary cohorts, in part because it was the first to come of age after the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 (the Hart-Cellar Act). Study design =Base year surveys= HS&B; began in 1980 as a nationally representative sample of 30,030 sophomores and 28,240 seniors in 1,015 public and private high schools in the United States. From the initial sample of 58,270 public and private high school students, 14,825 sophomores and 11,995 seniors were selected to be re-interviewed over their early adult years. Each school contained a representative sample of 36 sophomores and 36 seniors, making possible inferences about each school and its student body. The student questionnaires in 1980 gathered important information about educational experiences, cognitive skills (measured by standardized multiple-choice assessments of reading, math, science and social studies achievement) and non-cognitive skills (e.g., self-esteem, self- efficacy, emotional distress, social activities, academic effort, reports from four teachers about the students’ educational, behavioral, and social characteristics), as well as peers, employment activities, educational and occupational plans and aspirations, and family background (e.g., parental education, family composition, siblings, parenting practices and parents’ educational and occupational expectations for their children). =Follow-up surveys= The sample members were re-surveyed in 1982, in 1984, and in 1986. The 1980 sophomores were also surveyed in 1992 and 2013-2014. The 1980 seniors were surveyed again in 2015. All follow-ups conducted in the 1980s and 1992 gathered information about cohort members’ educational, employment, and family activities and transitions. The 1982 re-interview of sophomores featured a second round of cognitive tests and gathered secondary school transcripts, and the 1986 and 1992 surveys gathered post-secondary transcripts. Post-secondary transcripts were obtained for seniors in 1984 and 1986. The newest round of data collection is to begin in 2021, surveying the 1980 sophomores and seniors. The follow-up is designed to learn more about the 1980 cohort as they age.  Key findings  A wealth of information has been generated from the data gathered by the HS&B; study. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) issued numerous reports as well as other publications generated from the study. Many of these reports address key education policy issues and are available to the public from the NCES website. Researchers have used the HS&B; data to write many journal articles (over 400), books, dissertations (over 250), and other reports (over 200) in a number of subject areas, including sociology, management, business, education, economics, political science, planning development, family studies, urban studies, social work, public administration, health care and health policy, and others. In the area of education, HS&B; data have been used for studies related to: * the roles that schools play in the educational outcomes of students in general (Raudenbush et al., 1991; Lee and Bryk, 1989; Gamoran, 1987).[7,8,9] * the roles that schools play in the development of students’ noncognitive skills (Bryk, Lee and Holland, 1993; Coleman and Hoffer, 1987).[10,11] * the causes and effects of dropping out (McCaul et al., 1992; McNeal Jr., 1997; Pittman, 1991).[12-14] * the racial issues in regards to educational equity and educational outcomes (Taeuber and James,1982; Taeuber and James, 1983; Lucas, 2001; Madhere, 1997; Morgan, 1996; Rivkin, 1995).[15-20] * the gender related issues in regards to educational equity and educational outcomes (Riegle-Crumb et al., 2012; Marsh, 1989).[21-22] * the effects of extracurricular activities and work outside of school on academic performance (Marsh, 1991; Marsh, 1992; Marsh and Kleitman, 2005).[23-25] * the effects of self-esteem and self-concept on academic achievement (Mahaffy, 2004; Marsh, 1990a; Bekhuis, 1994).[26-28] * the effects of family structure, parental involvement, and related variables on children's school achievement (Astone and McLanahan, 1991; Marsh, 1990b; Milne et al., 1986; Astone and McLanan, 1993; Zimiles and Lee, 1991).[29-33] In the area of employment, HS&B; data have been used for studies related to: * the importance of social capital in the creation of human capital (Coleman, 1988).[34] * the effects of cognitive skills in relation to wages and other labor market outcomes (Murnane, Willett, and Levy, 1995; Murnane, Willett, and Tyler, 2000).[35-36] * the effects of noncognitive factors on to wages and other labor market outcomes (Deluca and Rosenbaum, 2001; Rosenbaum, 2001).[37-38] * the effects of schools on earnings and labor market outcomes (Eide, Showalter, and Sims, 2002).[39] HS&B; data have been used for research in areas outside of education and employment, such as alcohol use (Martin and Pritchard, 1991)[40], family studies (O'Hare, 1991; Goldscheider and Goldscheider, 1989; Goldscheider and Goldscheider, 1991; Goldscheider and Goldscheider, 1993)[41-44], obesity (Faith et al., 1998)[45], and teenage pregnancy (Hanson, Myers and Ginsburg, 1987; Parnell, Swicegood and Stevens, 1994).[46-47] Findings from the HS&B; study have helped to inform public policy debates about workforce training and financial aid for college, among other things. Information from the study has helped scientists and lawmakers understand what shapes people's lives between high school and early adulthood. Lawmakers have used findings using the HS&B; data to design national education policies, such as the expansion of the States Scholars Program in 2005.  Current activity  In 2019, researchers at the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Wisconsin, and the University of Minnesota in collaboration with NORC at the University of Chicago began planning for a new follow-up of the HS&B; sample members, called High School and Beyond: Educational and Early Life Predictors of Mild Cognitive Impairment: New Evidence about Mediators and Moderators from High School & Beyond (also known as 2021 HS&B; Follow-up Study), funded by the National Institute on Aging that will follow up with approximately 25,500 sample members of the 1980 sophomore and senior classes from the original HS&B; study sponsored by NCES. The follow-up survey assesses sample members’ cognitive and non-cognitive skills and is designed to understand the connections between social relationships, education and health. The survey also collects updated information about their work experiences, health, family roles, and retirement planning at midlife. This information will be used to understand how sample members are faring since they were last contacted. The resulting research will focus on understanding how conditions and characteristics of adolescents and young adults, as well as their high schools and post-secondary institutions, shape the circumstances of their lives as they age and approach the retirement years.

This Hymn incorporates \\"God Save the King\\", \\"La Marseillaise\\", and \\"Il Canto degli Italiani\\". It was the first collaboration between the composer and Arrigo Boito, who, much later, would revise the libretto of Simon Boccanegra and write the original libretti of Otello and Falstaff. Although written for the 1862 International Exhibition in London, it premiered at Her Majesty's Theatre on 24 May 1862. It became the centerpiece of a 1944 propaganda film, Hymn of the Nations, where it was performed by the NBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Arturo Toscanini with Jan Peerce as tenor soloist.  Background  London Stereoscopic Company In December 1858, the Society of Arts in London announced their intention to hold what was to be called the 1862 International Exhibition, seen as a successor to The Great Exhibition of 1851.Marvin 2007, p. xii Wanting to include musical performances (which were excluded from the 1851 exhibition), at the suggestion of the leading music critic Henry Chorley, they solicited new works from Daniel Auber (representing France), William Sterndale Bennett (England), Giacomo Meyerbeer (Germany) and Gioachino Rossini (Italy).Phillips-Matz, pp. 446-449 Rossini declined the invitation. Roberta Montemorra Marvin (who edited Inno delle nazioni for The Complete Works of Giuseppe Verdi series) considers that the committee did not initially ask Verdi to compose a piece because of Chorley's antipathy toward the composer's works. Nevertheless, after Rossini's refusal, in 1861 the committee invited Verdi, offering four suggestions as to form: anthem, chorale, triumphal march (for full orchestra), or march (for wind instruments). While honored by the request, Verdi tentatively declined, despite the intervention of fellow Italian and conductor Michael Costa, claiming his duties in preparing La forza del destino left no time available. He promised to consider the question in February 1862, once the preparation of the opera was out of the way.Marvin 2007, p. xiii Although Verdi detested writing occasional works, Marvin surmises that since Verdi was informed of the acceptance of the commission by Auber and Meyerbeer, personal pride and the chance at representing Italy at an international exhibition were the key reasons he took up the commission.Marvin 2007, p. xiv  Composition history  When illness of the soprano forced a postponement of La forza del destino, Verdi departed St. Petersburg and arrived in Paris on 24 February 1862. Two encounters influenced his decision to commence work on a composition for the exhibition. The first was with the composer Daniel Auber who apparently conveyed to Verdi that he was composing a march for the occasion.Marvin 2007, p. xv In correspondence recalling this meeting, Verdi indicated that he was also composing a march. But in a subsequent letter to Costa he indicated he was writing an overture. Costa relayed this information to the commissioners who agreed with the form of composition. A young Boito Franco Faccio around 1865 Secondly, two up-and-coming Italian writers, Arrigo Boito and Franco Faccio, met with Verdi at the end of February 1862, bearing a letter of introduction from Countess Clara Maffei. Marvin suggests the purpose of the meeting might have been to indirectly prompt Verdi to work on the commission. As a result of this meeting, Boito was charged with writing the text of the proposed work. On 19 March the commissioners received a letter from the composer \\"in which he expressed his wish to substitute for the overture a cantata with Italian words, the solo part of which would be executed by Signor Tamberlik.\\"Marvin 2007, p. xv: Marvin suggests that Verdi wrote the letter about 16 March. Though the commissioners rejected Verdi's proposal (believing the work would be too large for the exhibition space), Verdi refused their rejection and continued working on the cantata (he called the work Cantica), completing it towards the end of March.Marvin 2007, p. xv He gave the completed manuscript to his wife Giuseppina, who traveled to London to deliver it in early April. Steadfast in their refusal to accept the work, they would not meet with Giuseppina and wrote to Verdi that they could not accept performance of the cantata, since the necessary preparations would be too large an undertaking. Verdi arrived in London on 20 April, expecting that his work would be performed. Through much wrangling the commissioners remained firm in their refusal, Costa declaring that because it was scored for voices, not just for orchestra, it was against the rules of the Commission, that it had not arrived in time, and that there would not be enough time to rehearse. Verdi wrote to the publisher Léon Escudier on 22 April telling him that his cantata would not be performed.Marvin 2007, p. xvi The press received word of the refusal and wrote that the problem was Verdi's inability to meet a deadline. In response, Verdi wrote to The Times, published on 24 April, denying the claim: \\"[The commissioners] let it be known that twenty-five days (enough to learn a new opera) were not enough to learn this short cantata; and they refused it.\\" He continued by stating that he wanted to \\"correct the error - that I did not send my composition\\".Verdi's letter to The Times, 23 April 1862, in Phillips-Matz, p. 448 Critical opinion sided with Verdi, and the blame fell on the commissioners.Marvin 2007, p. xvii The incident proved embarrassing for them and for music director Costa. According to the Musical World, \\"The whole feeling of the country in this instance is with the Italian Maestro, and against the Commissioners. The cry has gone forth from one end of the kingdom to the other that a grievous wrong has been done, and that restitution is imperatively demanded.\\"Musical World 10 May 1862, as reprinted in Marvin 2007, pp. xvii-xx: Marvin goes into great detail concerning the incident including its political ramifications and possible reasons for why it erupted so vehemently  First performance and reception  Verdi was in the audience for the inaugural concert of the International Exhibition on 1 May 1862. The concert received only a lukewarm reception, making Verdi happy that his Cantica had not been programmed. The first performance of the cantata took place at Her Majesty's Theatre (at the time under the leadership of James Henry Mapleson) on 24 May 1862, after a performance of The Barber of Seville. \\"Every member\\" of Mapleson's company participated in the performance supplemented by 200 choristers of Jules Benedict's Vocal Association - the entire ensemble conducted by Luigi Arditi. Marvin 2007, p. xx Verdi wrote to his publisher Giovanni Ricordi \\"The effect seemed good, and it was encored ... Performance good on the whole, very good on the part of the orchestra. Arditi is a good conductor.\\" Franco Faccio (who had been with Boito at their first meeting with Verdi) wrote to Boito: \\"The effect of the piece is irresistible.\\" Marvin feels that the controversy surrounding the genesis of the work makes it difficult to gauge contemporaneous reception. A review in the Revue et gazette musicale (1 June 1862) underscores the difficulty: \\"[The] unprecedented, incomprehensible conduct [the commissioners showed] to a man of such celebrity as Verdi, refusing a composition which he took the pains to bring himself, excited such astonishment and so turned all sympathies to his side, that his composition became famous even before anyone had heard it.\\" Most reviews tended to be overly sympathetic to the composer. The report in The Daily Telegraph provides an example of the exaggerated reaction: > At the conclusion of the Cantata Signor Verdi was loudly called for, and, > after some delay, was led on by the energetic and enthusiastic Mdlle. > Tietjiens, not once nor twice only, but several times, to receive the > heartiest tribute of approbation which an appreciative and sympathetic > English audience could bestow. Not that the manifestations of good feelings > were confined to applause alone, for bouquets and wreaths were showered on > the favourite maestro, and favourite vocalists were even roused from their > ordinary listlessness to do demonstrative honour to their illustrious > countryman. The applause still continuing, the whole Cantata was then > repeated. At the conclusion of the second performance Signor Verdi was then > led forward by Signor Giuglini, and even after the curtain fell, he was > compelled again to bow his acknowledgments. Chorley's review continued his antagonism toward Verdi: \\"we must state frankly that the Cantata appears to be no favourable specimen of Signore Verdi's peculiar manner, and beside being of a form entirely different from that in which he was invited to compose, is, in every point of taste and of art, unsuited to the occasion for which it was designed.\\"  Political implications  Reviewers questioned Verdi's decision to include songs representing England (\\"God Save the Queen\\"), France (\\"La Marseillaise\\") and Italy (\\"Il Canto degli Italiani\\", also known as \\"Inno di Mameli\\"). At the time, neither \\"La Marseillaise\\" nor \\"Il Canto degli Italiani\\" were their respective country's national anthem. Some critics, such as the unnamed one writing in the Musical World, incorrectly thought the inclusion of such nationalistic songs or the potential political embarrassment from their inclusion was the reason for the cantata's rejection from the inaugural concert.Marvin 2007, p. xviii Chorley and other critics charged Boito with presenting a biased view of European harmony, one dominated by Italy.Marvin 2007, p. xix Marvin observes the cover art also shows Italy on a par with England and France and she hypothesizes that it was not financial gain that led Verdi to accept the commission but rather a desire to affirm Italy's musical, particularly its operatic, supremacy. This feeling is illustrated in the long letter which Verdi wrote to Arrivabene:Verdi to Arrivabene, 2 May 1862, in Phillips-Matz, p. 449: \\"there is no corner of the world ... where Italian opera is not sung\\" Marvin considers that Verdi, well aware of his own importance in the musical world, saw this as a chance to serve as a voice supportive of Italian music in an international context, although the composer expressed to both his publisher and to his friend Count Arrivabene his lack of interest in writing pieces for a given occasion.Verdi to Ricordi, 24 April 1862, and to Arrivabene, 2 May 1862, in Phillips-Matz, pp. 448-449  Subsequent performances  After the world premiere, Inno delle nazioni was presented six more times in London in 1862; the final occasion was on 16 June, along with all the music written for the 1862 International Exposition. Marvin 2007, p. xxi The Paris premiere took place on 2 May 1863 at the Théatre Italien at a benefit concert for the composer Charles Billema. The solo was performed by a soprano, Rosina Penco. The first Italian performance took place on 24 June 1864 at the Teatro alla Scala, although, in giving permission, Verdi was skeptical that it would be a success:\\"It will be a fiasco, as all my works are, when they are first performed in Milan\\".Verdi to Ricordi, 12 June 1864, in Phillips-Matz, p. 475 The first American performance took place on 28 April 1874 at the Academy of Music in New York, conducted by Emanuele Muzio (a long-time assistant of Verdi's), with Christina Nilsson as the soloist.Marvin 2007, pp. xxi-xxii Some of the 20th-century performances of Inno delle nazioni were for propaganda purposes. Arturo Toscanini conducted it on 25 July 1915 in an outdoor arena in Milan, shortly after Italy entered World War I. During World War II Toscanini performed it on 31 January 1943 with the NBC Symphony Orchestra, Jan Peerce as soloist, and choristers from Westminster Choir College in a highly touted broadcast and the work was also the centerpiece of a 31-minute film for the United States Office of War Information called Hymn of the Nations, directed by Alexander Hammid. It was filmed at the NBC Studios and consists of Toscanini conducting the NBC Symphony in a performance of Verdi's Overture to La forza del destino and Inno delle nazioni, which contains the national anthems of England, France, and Italy (the World War I allied nations), to which Toscanini added the Soviet \\"Internationale\\" and \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\". The film, which featured a performance by Toscanini and the same forces as the 1943 broadcast, was narrated by Burgess Meredith.Marvin 2007, p. xxii\\"Toscanini: Hymn of the Nations\\", Time, 29 April 1946 online at content.time.com Another rendition was commissioned for the ending of the documentary 16 Days of Glory about the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. With Plácido Domingo as tenor soloist, the new orchestration incorporated the national anthems of Finland, the Netherlands, Italy, United Kingdom, France, Australia, Canada, Mexico, Japan, Germany, and the United States. Music  The cantata is scored for piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, cimbasso, timpani, bass drum, cymbals, percussion, 2 harps, and strings. The \\"characters\\" in the critical edition are designated as the \\"Coro di Popolo\\" (Chorus of People of all nations) and the tenor soloist is \\"Un Bardo\\" (a poet) (\\"A Voice Among Them\\").Marvin, \\"CANTICA (HYMN OF THE NATIONS)\\" section in the critical edition, Cantica IV/1 - Hymns * Inni on humanities.uchicago.edu.

There are up to about 33 species.Asyneuma. The Plant List. Characters used to identify Asyneuma species include a generally wheel-shaped (rotate) corolla with the petals fused at the bases and spreading outward into very narrow lobes, lacking or rudimentary appendages on the calyx, a stigma with 2 to 4 lobes, and an oblong or roughly spherical fruit capsule that breaks open via pores on the sides.Parolly, G. (2000). Notes on two neglected Turkish Asyneuma taxa (Campanulaceae). Willdenowia 30(1), 67-75. These characters are not always helpful in distinguishing Asyneuma from the closely related genus Campanula, because authors disagree on which character is more important: the extent to which the flower petals are joined versus the position of the pores on the fruit capsule.

The company grew organically making games for third parties, including foreign game developers and national mobile operators like ENTEL and CLARO CHILE. In 2010 AmnesiaGames won a regional contest from Nokia, with its game “Ninja Joe”.Radio Cooperativa: Juego Chileno robó miradas en concurso de Nokia The game was available for J2ME (JAVAME) devices in the Nokia StoreThe original Ninja Joe in the Nokia Store where -according to AmnesiaGames CEO- it was downloaded near 1.5 million times achieving top 10 rankings in some Asian countries. After this event, AmnesiaGames become a developer partner for Nokia Chile and for two years developed series of games and applications for J2ME and Symbian. In 2012, the company refocused its strategy and began building games for iOS and Android. As the company had experienced first-hand the fragmentation problem in J2ME, it was soon obvious they had to overcome the new fragmentation problem of all the competing platforms with a technological tool. During 2012 the engineers at AmnesiaGames developed a proprietary engine called internally APE (Amnesia Programing Engine). The engine is programmed in a C++ like scripting language, is intended for 2D games and exports to several platforms including: iOS, Android, WindowsPhone, Windows8, HTML5 and Flash. In December 2012 AmnesiaGames released its first multiplatform game based on its proprietary engine APE. The name of the game is again “Ninja Joe”. The version from 2010 is now called “Ninja Joe Classic”.Ninja Joe Classic in the WindowsPhone Store The game is available in Apple Appstore,Ninja Joe in the Apple Appstore Google Play,Ninja Joe in the Google Play WindowsPhone,Ninja Joe in the WindowsPhone Windows8,Ninja Joe in the Windows8 Store Amazon,Ninja Joe in the Amazon store Blackberry 10,Ninja Joe in the Blackberry store Blackberry Playbook and Samsung Apps.Ninja Joe in the Samsung Apps store The game was the first Chilean game created for Windows 8 LUN.com - Ninja Joe includes the polemic quote \\"Windows8 va a ser como Mac\\" (Windows8 is going to be like Mac). and was spotlighted by Amazon as Free App of the Day on 9th Abril 2013,31 minutos highlighted by Apple and Ninja Joe by Amazon by Lenovo in its Windows8 Store on 18 March 2013, Samsung Apps Spain on 14 July 2013 and by Microsoft Chile on 16 June and 2 August 2013.

Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time. Description The lyrics are largely biographical containing a number of details from Jesse James' life, portraying him as an American version of Robin Hood, though there is no evidence to indicate that he actually \\"stole from the rich and gave to the poor\\". The song is the starting point of the Jesse James panel of a mural on American folk songs by Thomas Hart Benton.Annett Claudia Richter - Fiddles, Harmonicas, and Banjos: Thomas Hart Benton and His Role ... 2008 -- Page 218 \\"From the widely spread folk song \\"Jesse James,\\" Benton selected two of the outlaw's most remembered actions: the robbery of a bank and of a train together with his gang. The story of Jesse James appeared in the St. Joseph, Missouri, ...\\" > But that dirty little coward That shot Mr. Howard Has laid poor Jesse in his > grave. Robert Ford, who killed Jesse, was a James' gang member. Mr. Howard was the alias that James lived under in Saint Joseph, Missouri at the time of his killing. The song was recorded in 1924 by Bascom Lamar Lunsford and subsequently by many artists, including Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Eddy Arnold, Jackson C. Frank, The Country Gentlemen, The Pogues, The Kingston Trio, Van Morrison, Bob Seger, Willy DeVille, Mungo Jerry and Bruce Springsteen. It is the most famous song about James. Part of the song is heard at the end of the 1939 movie, Jesse James. The song was used in a 1958 episode of the TV western series Lawman, in which the marshal tries to get Robert Ford (played by Martin Landau) out of town safely. Ry Cooder's arrangement of the song plays over the end credits of Walter Hill's 1980 movie The Long Riders and a portion of the song is performed on-screen by Nick Cave, who plays a strolling balladeer in a bar patronized by Robert Ford in the 2007 movie The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. The folksinger Almeda Riddle, born Almeda James, was a first cousin twice removed of Frank and Jesse James. On a recording of the song she noted, \\"I'm sure you've read of Frank and Jesse James. Well, my father's grandfather and their father (Robert S. James) was brothers. I never was ashamed of the James boys was my cousins, but neither was I proud of it.\\" The composer of the song is unknown, but it is attributed in the lyrics of some versions to a to \\"Billy Gashade\\" or \\"\\"Billy LaShade\\", though no historical record exists for anyone under either name. This song is popular in the bluegrass repertoire; it is usually played as an instrumental, most often in the key of B. Lyrics Although the lyrics and structure of the song vary among versions, the following arrangement is typical: > Jesse James was a lad that killed many a man, He robbed the Glendale train, > He stole from the rich and he gave to the poor, He'd a hand and a heart and > a brain. Well it was Robert Ford, that dirty little coward, I wonder how he > feels, For he ate of Jesse's bread and he slept in Jesse's bed, And he laid > poor Jesse in his grave. (chorus) Well Jesse had a wife to mourn for his > life, Three children, [now] they were brave, Well that dirty little coward > that shot Mr. [Mister] Howard, He laid poor Jesse [Has laid Jesse James] in > his grave. Jesse was a man, a friend to the poor, He'd never rob a mother or > a child, There never was a man with the law in his hand, That could take > Jesse James alive. Jesse was a man, a friend to the poor, He'd never see a > man suffer pain, And with his brother Frank he robbed the Chicago bank, And > stopped the Glendale train. It was on a Saturday night and the moon was > shining bright, They robbed the Glendale train, And people they did say o'er > many miles away It was those outlaws, they're Frank and Jesse James (chorus) > Now the people held their breath when they heard of Jesse's death, And > wondered how he ever came to fall Robert Ford, it was a fact, he shot Jesse > in the back While Jesse hung a picture on the wall Now Jesse went to rest > with his hand on his breast, The devil will be upon his knee. He was born > one day in the County Clay, And he came from a solitary race. (chorus) A somewhat different version, alternately titled I Wonder Where My Poor Old Jesse's Gone, is as follows: > Jesse James was a man that was knowed through all the land For Jesse he was > bold and bad and brave But that dirty little coward that shot down Mr. > Howard Has went and laid poor Jesse in his grave Oh I wonder where my poor > old Jesse's gone Oh I wonder where my poor old Jesse's gone I will meet him > in that land where I've never been before And I wonder where my poor old > Jesse's gone Jesse and his brother, Frank, they robbed the Gallatin bank And > carried the money from the town It was in that very place that they had a > little race And they shot Captain Sheets to the ground It was on a Wednesday > night and the moon was shining bright They robbed the Glendale train And the > agent on his knees, delivered up the keys To the outlaws, Frank and Jesse > James It was on a Friday night and the moon was shining bright Bob Ford had > been hiding in a cave He had ate of Jesse's bread, he had slept in Jesse's > bed But he went and laid poor Jesse in his grave (chorus) Jesse James was > alone a-straightening up his home Stood on a chair to dust a picture frame > When Bob Ford fired the ball that pulled Jesse from the wall And he went and > laid poor Jesse in his grave Jesse James has gone to rest with his hands > upon his breast There's many a man that never knowed his face He was born > one day in the county of Clay And he came from a solitary race References External links *List of recordings of the song *Statistics on recordings of the song Category:1924 songs Category:American folk songs Category:Bruce Springsteen songs Category:Pete Seeger songs Category:The Pogues songs Category:Van Morrison songs Category:Woody Guthrie songs Category:Songs about Jesse James ","title":"Jesse James (folk song)"},{"id":"40315548","text":"Berhane Gebre-Christos (; born 1953) is an Ethiopian politician.

Main subjects =Eruv Chatzeirot= An eruv (; Hebrew: עירוב, \\"mixture\\"), also transliterated as eiruv or erub, plural: eruvin [ʔeʁuˈvin]) is a ritual enclosure that permits Jewish residents or visitors to carry certain objects outside their own homes on Sabbath and Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement). An eruv accomplishes this by integrating a number of private and public properties into one larger private domain, thereby countermanding restrictions on carrying objects from the private to the public domain on Sabbath and holidays. The eruv allows these religious Jews to, among other things, carry house keys, tissues, medicines, or babies with them, and use strollers and canes. Orthodox Judaism prohibits motorized transportation on Shabbat and holidays, although the presence of an eruv for carrying permits certain types of non-motorized transport such as strollers and wheelchairs. The presence or absence of an eruv thus especially affects the lives of people with limited mobility and those responsible for taking care of babies and young children. =Eruv techumin= An eruv techumin (Hebrew: עירוב תחומין \\"mixed borders\\") for traveling enables a traditionally observant Jew to travel on Shabbat or a Jewish holiday. The Jew prepares food prior to Shabbat or a holiday at a location to which they plan to travel that is farther than is normally allowed on such days. =Eruv tavshilin= An eruv tavshilin (Hebrew: עירוב תבשילין \\"mixed cooked food items\\") is made in the home on the eve of a holiday with a work proscription that directly precedes the Sabbath. It is made by taking a cooked item and a baked item, and placing them together. It is common to use a piece of cooked egg, fish, or meat as the cooked item and a piece of bread or matzah as the baked item. It is needed because while it is allowed to cook and transfer fire on holidays (unlike the Sabbath and Yom Kippur, when these activities are forbidden), these activities are allowed to be done for use on only the holiday, and not for the next day. The eruv tavshilin makes it possible to begin preparing for the Sabbath before the holiday, and continue doing so. The foods of the eruv tavshilin are traditionally eaten on the Sabbath day following the holiday.

Cardenes Luis Cruz Azaceta (born April 5, 1942) is a Cuban American painter. Since the late 1970s the paintings and drawings of Luis Cruz Azaceta have been taking the moral and ethical pulse of this country. In usually large-format works, executed with highly expressive colors, Cruz Azaceta has dealt with themes of urban violence, the type of personal isolation that comes with living in a large and overcrowded city, the hellish conditions created by mismanaged government, the abuses and oppression of dictatorships and, in a number of highly affecting works done back in the late 1980s, the ravages of AIDS. Azaceta is a true maverick...his art does not look much like anyone else's...He is a devotee of visual experiment who often develops parallel series in several media at once, and he has a tendency to combine materials in totally unexpected ways, as with his extended series of photographs mounted on twisted metal stud. Last but not least, Azaceta works constantly, is extremely prolific...Day after day, Azaceta, like most of us but differently, uses all his effort figuring out how to move forward, while never permitting himself to lose sight of what's been left behind. For him, art is not a vehicle by which one achieves aesthetic satisfaction and an escape from common history and time. Rather, it is a way of facing the world. Azaceta recognizes that change is inevitable, and that all of us are implicated by reality and time passing. The world we inhabit is contingent and changing; and chaos is an inherent part of the process. This is the reality we all share and which we all too often ignore. Gun Man (1986), 120x84 inches, acrylic on canvas  Early life and work  Luis Cruz Azaceta was born in Havana, Cuba. As a teenager, he witnessed many acts of violence on the streets of Havana: bombs in stores, cinemas and theaters; shoot-outs, arrests and torture of citizens by Batista secret police. In 1959, the Cuban revolution brought jubilation and celebration when Castro promised to restore Cuba's constitution and free elections. Months later executions began, businesses were confiscated and some closed. Azaceta's experiences under both Batista and post-revolution impacted his vision—creating a sensitivity towards violence, human cruelty, injustice and alienation—which later become central themes in his work. At 18 years old, Azaceta left Cuba for New York City. Drawing and painting became a means for expressing himself and creating an identity in the big metropolis of the city. In 1969 he graduated from the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan. After graduation, he developed series of works addressing the human condition. In 1975 he had his first solo show at the Allan Frumkin Gallery on 57th Street, exhibiting works from the Subway Series. In the mid-1970s, at the beginning of his career, Azaceta tended to fill his compositions with numerous cartoony images and figures which were boldly colored and clearly outlined. Many of the paintings articulate a shallow cramped space. ...Azaceta underscores his vision of the urban dweller as a threatened figure, someone who is constantly being pushed, pulled, and squeezed by both the environment and other people. The Plague, AIDS Epidemic (1987), 120x144 inches, acrylic on canvas While Azaceta's \\"apocalyptic pop\\" style characterized his initial entry into the art world, he soon felt a need to move on. It could be said that Azaceta's need to change is not only one of the features that distinguishes him from other painters, whether figurative or abstract, but it is also emblematic of his life as both an exile and an alien. He lives in the Diaspora and knows that home is something he carries with him, that there is no final and permanent refuge. By the 1980s his cramped compositions shift to a centralized, nude figure (often self-portrait) that dominates the composition. The mood and color are somber and the figure is often distorted. Luis Cruz Azaceta is one of the great expressionists. In the neo-expressionist boom of the 80s, he was who revived \\"the historic role of expressionism as a social and moral force\\", as Rachel Weiss said. Azaceta is the great urban chronicler, the painter of contemporary Babylons with their landscapes of violence, drugs, crime, plagues, fires. It isn't strange that the great critical painting of New York City as paradigm of a metropolis, has been carried out by an immigrant of the Third World...  Later life and work  In the early 1990s his work incorporated figuration and abstraction, perhaps extending from some of the works of the Aids Epidemic Series where abstraction is present as an ominous abyss. He returns to the subject of Balseros and Exiles using fields of circles and grids to generate a piercing dialog with the figure. In 1992 he moves with his wife and two sons from New York to New Orleans where a warehouse studio provides him space for producing larger scale works, constructions and installations. He begins shooting photographs of the New Orleans environment which become attachments in paintings. A new materiality enters the work: twisted metal studs, nails, wood, board, plastic barricade fencing and weathered sheet metal. Ironically the new found materiality and subject of exile connect in his installation, SWEPT AWAY, 2008 presented at Prospect 1. New Orleans Biennial from his Post Katrina series. Numerous series follow, some of which include the Museum Plans, Shifting States, Shootings in Sandy Hook and the Boston Bombing. With Museum Plans, Luis Cruz Azaceta once again demonstrates an enviable ability to analyze culture and society. ...He now has the sensitivity to see the pitfalls and difficult aspects of the individuals and institutions who govern culture, and he is able to brilliantly express them in those labyrinths of lines devoid of exits. Real Fiction (1996), 105x108x4 3/4 inches, mixed media on wood & metal studs The series Shifting States (2011-2012) is dedicated to the shocks that we have witnessed in recent years: Economies crumble, revolutions, wars, civil movements against social injustice, sudden climatic changes. The title of the series has a double meaning, referring to a time of major changes that we witness and the psychological state (the shifting state) which involves a state of self-awareness that leads to the necessary transformation. In his most recent series....Azaceta is delivered to one of the most pressing issues in American society today: mass shootings and domestic terrorism. His series of Sandy Hook and the Boston Bombing are paradigmatic in this regard. The Crossing (1999), 112x120 inches, acrylic, charcoal, shellac on canvas Azaceta's work has been featured in more than 100 solo exhibitions in the U.S., Europe and Latin America. Currently his work can be seen at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, in the exhibition entitled, \\" I, YOU, WE\\", curated by David Kiehl, and at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D.C., in the exhibition entitled, OUR AMERICA: THE LATINO PRESENCE IN AMERICAN ART, curated by E. Carmen Ramos. In his critically acclaimed 2013 solo exhibition Dictators, Terrorism, War and Exiles at Aljira, Center for Contemporary Art, curator, Alejandro Anreus writes that Luis Cruz Azaceta is committed \\"to bearing witness to the political crisis of humanity. His work reflects how he identifies with isolation and oppression and speaks to both the horror and determination that is a part of the journey towards survival and freedom.\\" He has received numerous awards and grants, including the National Endowment for the Arts, The Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Grant, The Joan Mitchell Foundation Grant, Pollock/Krasner Grant, Penny McCall, New York Foundation for the Arts, Mid-Atlantic Grant for Special Projects and the Cintas Foundation. His work can be seen in numerous museum collections, some of which include: The Museum of Modern Art, NY, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY, The Whitney Museum of American Art, NY, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D.C., Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Delaware Art Museum, Museo De Arte Moderno, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, Museo De Bellas Artes, Caracas, Venezuela, Atrium Museo De Arte Contemporaneo, Victoria Gasteoz, Spain and Museo De Arte Contemporaneo De Monterrey, Mexico.

In the introduction White states the original goal of his 1874 lecture on The Battlefields of Science and elaborated in a book The Warfare of Science the same year: In these volumes he chronicles the gradual emancipation of science from theology in various fields. Content ;Chapter 1 From Creation to Evolution The literal interpretation of Genesis, including denial of all death and of animals not of use to man before the introduction of sin, gives way to the recognition of the enormous number of species in the world. Various evolutionary ideas opposed progressively by Linnaeus, Cuvier and Agassiz led up to the theory of natural selection proposed by Darwin and Wallace. The initial theological opposition gradually gave way to compromise by most churches. ;Chapter 2 Geography The spherical ideas of Pythagoras, Plato and Aristotle had replaced earlier ideas from Chaldeans and Egyptians of a flat earth. The church fathers favoured the idea of a solid roof or firmament over the earth and this was elaborated early on, but in the Middle Ages most followed authorities such as Thomas Aquinas in accepting sphericity. Jerusalem was accepted as the centre of the world and a refusal to accept the existence of antipodes led many to assume that the other side of the world was entirely aqueous. Opposition to the antipodes did not cease for centuries after Magellan's voyages and also contributed to underestimates of the size of the earth, which happened to help Columbus. Religious feeling encouraged the expansion of Europeans across the globe. ;Chapter 3 Astronomy Despite earlier more literal ideas, the Ptolemaic view of a geocentric universe was allegedly adopted by the Church, adding an immovable heavenly sphere above the stars and hell below the earth. In the sixteenth century, Copernicus challenged this view but his book was not published until after his death, when it was given a preface suggesting that it was simply a hypothesis. When Galileo used his telescope to show other reasons for rejecting the Ptolemaic view he faced opposition from both Catholics and Protestants. He was forced to renounce his sun-centred view, which was not formally accepted by the Catholic church before the nineteenth century. In England attacks continued into the eighteenth. ;Chapter 4 From \\"Signs and Wonders\\" to Law in the Heavens Comets, meteors and eclipses were widely seen as portents of doom by most early civilizations. Although natural explanations for eclipses were understood in the Christian era, comets and meteors continued to be regarded as warnings by Bede, Aquinas and others and they could not be reconciled with conceptions of the heavenly spheres. Till the end of the seventeenth century there were attempts to keep astronomical explanations of comets from the university curriculum and church congregations. ;Chapter 5 From Genesis to Geology Early Greek germs of explanations of fossils received no attention in Christendom before Leonardo da Vinci and even in the mid-eighteenth century Comte de Buffon was forced to retract simple geological truths by the theology faculty of the Sorbonne. The doctrine of creation provided no room for animals, particularly carnivores, prior to Adam's fall and most theories of geology revolved around the flood which broke open \\"the fountains of the great deep\\". Attacks on geologists such as William Buckland, Dean Conybeare and Prof Sedgwick from religious people continued into the nineteenth century, claiming that geology was \\"not a subject of lawful inquiry\\" and that they were \\"attacking the truth of God\\". But finally, Buckland abandoned his adherence to the special place of the flood in geological history and Lyell's uniformitarian doctrine held sway. Subsequently George Smith's discovery that the Genesis story was an adaptation of earli—er Chaldean flood myths finished most attempts to use the flood story in science. ;Chapter 6 The Antiquity of Man, Egyptology, and Assyriology The Biblical record was traditionally taken as a standard for the antiquity of mankind with estimates of 5199 BC under Pope Urban VIII in 1640 and 4004 BC of Bishop Ussher in 1650. Joseph Scaliger had previously argued for taking the histories of Egypt and Babylon into account and during the eighteenth century it became increasingly difficult to fit their chronologies into this timescale. In the nineteenth century, Menes, the first king of Egypt, was dated at more than 3,000 BC and that itself represented an advanced civilization, with its pyramids, sphinxes and astronomical knowledge. Manetho gave lists before this covering 24,000 years. Excavations of pottery in the Nile flood area gave times of 11,000 years. These periods were confirmed in Assyria and Babylon. ;Chapter 7 The Antiquity of Man and Prehistoric Archaeology Stone axes from Spain From early ages people had found \\"thunder-stones, shaped stones which were built into walls in Chaldea and hung round the necks of Egyptian dead. During the middle ages these were venerated as weapons used to drive out Satan in the \\"war in heaven\\". In the late 16th century, Michael Mercati attempted to prove they were weapons or implements of early races of men, but his and later finds were largely ignored until in 1847 Boucher de Perthes published the first volume of Celtic and Antediluvian Antiquities which included engravings of some of the thousands he had found close to the Somme. In 1861, Edward Lartet showed evidence that humans had coexisted with extinct quaternary animals whose bones had cut marks on them and subsequently the existence of cave paintings at Les Eyzies and La Madeleine. More finds even suggested that humans may have existed in the Tertiary period and showed \\"the utter inadequacy of the chronology given in our sacred books\\". ;Chapter 8 The \\"Fall of Man\\" and Anthropology The Biblical view of the perfect creation of humans followed by a fall is paralleled by stories of a golden age in many cultures. The alternative, that man has slowly risen from low or brutal beginnings, is also found in Greece and most notably Lucretius. Finds of Cro-Magnon and other skulls showed a rise in form. Finds in Scandinavia and elsewhere demonstrated a progression from stone to bronze to iron implements. Prehistoric buildings also showed development and this was also demonstrated by comparative ethnography. Attempts to challenge these have not been widely credited. ;Chapter 9 The \\"Fall of Man\\" and Ethnology Studies of groups of people in the early stages of development show many similarities with evidence of Egyptian or Jewish archaeology, demonstrating development. This was opposed by several otherwise liberal men, including Archbishop Whately and the Duke of Argyll, who argued that barbarous races were the remains of civilized races, not their forerunners. ;Chapter 10 The \\"Fall of Man\\" and History History shows many examples where weaker bodies of men driven out of society have not relapsed to barbarism but have risen even under the most unfavourable circumstances. Other civilizations that have declined have been replaced by richer. Thus \\"Anthropology and its handmaids Ethnology, Philology and History, have wrought out, beyond a doubt, proofs of the upward evolution of humanity\\". ;Chapter 11 From \\"The Prince of the Power of the Air\\" to Meteorology The conceptions of the early church about the weather were largely concerned with the (solid) firmament above the earth, whether flat or spherical. Many writings were ascribed to Bede who thought the firmament was formed of ice. Albert the great attempted to reconcile the views of Aristotle with those of the fathers. But often the attempt was to explain scriptural ideas such as the promise of a rainbow given to Noah or to ascribe storms to demons. Disasters—floods, droughts, lightning—come as direct punishment from God for human sins. This applied up to the eighteenth century. The worst superstition blamed witches and used torture to extract confessions. Blaming demons for storms only ceased after Franklin's kite experiment with lightning in 1752. ;Chapter 12 From Magic to Chemistry and Physics Magic, which had been regarded with tolerance in the Roman empire as long as it was used for purposes such as healing, was seen in Christianity as the active interference of Satan. Constantine quickly brought in severe laws against magic and magicians, though he subsequently said that his intention was only against malignant uses. But subsequent emperors forgot this distinction and severity against magic increased. By 1317 when Pope John XXII issued his bull aimed at the alchemists, he also dealt a severe blow to the beginnings of chemical science. In 1484 Pope Innocent VIII let inquisitors loose in Germany armed with the Witches Hammer to torture and destroy men and women for sorcery and magic. The Reformation did little to change things. Roger Bacon was deemed a superstitious alchemist. John Baptist Porta's scientific society was broken up in the late 16th century. Even Robert Boyle was attacked from the Oxford pulpit. Attempts to resist scientific teaching continued into the 19th century. ;Chapter 13 From Miracles to Medicine Christianity brought hospitals and infirmaries following the lead of Jesus the healer. But there was a tendency to elevate normal acts of healing into subsequent accounts of miracles, as in the case of St. Francis Xavier. From this came an industry in healing relics and belief in the 'royal touch'. For many years there was an idea that dissection was sacrilege and surgery was regarded as dishonourable. Until the 14th century it was mainly Jewish and Muslim physicians that promoted ideas of hygiene, and physical remedies risked the charge of magic. As Vesalius pioneered new approaches in the 16th century, many in the churches clung to the outmoded views of Galen. In the 18th and 19th centuries there was much religious opposition to the idea of inoculation. ;Chapter 14 From Fetich to Hygiene Pestilences were frequent in medieval times but an idea took hold that cleanliness betokens pride and filthiness humility, leading to many of the great saints not washing for years. Since holy relics were regarded as cures, the church grew richer at times of epidemics. In the 16th century the blame for disease was often placed on heretics and witches who were widely tortured. But only in the 19th century was scientific hygiene widely introduced. ;Chapter 15 From \\"Demoniacal Possession\\" to Insanity In Greek and Roman times, the idea of insanity as brain disease was gradually developed, but this was forgotten by a church who believed in diabolic possession, despite the efforts of some religious orders to keep scientific doctrines alive. This led to the tendency to punish the insane to combat the devils, particularly to eradicate Satan's pride. Only in the 18th century were more humane methods gradually introduced. ;Chapter 16 From Diabolism to Hysteria As early as the 11th century there are accounts of diabolic possession taking the form of epidemics of raving, dancing and convulsions, particularly among women and children. This became pronounced at the end of the 14th century after the Black Death. In the 16th century Paracelsus suggested it might be a physical disease, but in the 17th there were further outbreaks such as the Loudun possessions and those leading to the witch trials at Salem and Würzburg. Later outbreaks were dispersed by more sceptical and humane means. ;Chapter 17 From Babel to Comparative Philology Every people held that its language was given to it by its own deity. The Hebrew story recounts the story of the Tower of Babel as the source of multitudes of languages, a story which finds parallels in Hindu and Mayan mythologies. The early church generally took the view that the original language was Hebrew, against which even Gregory of Nyssa argued in vain. There was trouble in the 16th century when some mistakenly argued that even the vowel signs in the Hebrew were part of the infallible text, not realising they were added by Rabbinic scribes between the 2nd and 11th centuries. Great efforts were made to trace the roots of European languages back to Hebrew, culminating in Bishop Walton's Polyglot Bible. This was confounded when Sanskrit, brought back to Europe originally by Jesuit missionaries, was shown by Sir William Jones to be the root of all the Indo-European languages, a verdict accepted by theologians, despite final skirmishes. ;Chapter 18 From the Dead Sea Legends to Comparative Mythology The \\"Lot's Wife\\" pillar on Mount Sodom, Israel. The pillar is made of halite. Myths and legends abound in all countries and from all periods to explain natural phenomena. For centuries those of the countries surrounding Palestine were studied in comparison to each other, but never those of Palestine itself. But the legends such as the pillar of salt said to be Lot's wife, near the Dead Sea, were universally believed in Christendom, from St. Jerome to Sir John Mandeville. Yet from the 16th century, travellers from Pierre Belon were more sceptical, culminating in the visit of Lieutenant Lynch of the US Navy who sailed on the Dead Sea in 1847 and claimed justification for the Biblical story, but described the pillar of salt as a superstition. White welcomes the change by theologians and concludes \\"the worst enemy of Christianity could wish nothing more than that its main leaders should prove that it can not be adopted save by those who accept, as historical, statements which unbiased men throughout the world know to be mythical\\". ;Chapter 19 From Leviticus to Political Economy The fathers of the church from Tertullian to St. Augustine joined with St. Basil in condemning money lent at interest as a 'fecund monster' and it was condemned at church councils from Elvira in 304 to Vienne in 1311, and money-lenders were banned from communion. It was reinforced by Thomas Aquinas and Dante. Hence there was little capital and few lenders: rates of interest became 40% in England and 10% per month in Italy and Spain. The rich who had no way to invest their money spent it in ostentatious living, and the Jews were hated as the money lenders. Eventually Calvin in the 16th century cut through the metaphysical arguments of Aristotle and declared that usury means illegal or oppressive interest. Commerce and trade revived in Protestant countries, though more slowly in Germany. No change happened in Catholic countries until Benedict XIV in 1745 left open vague \\"occasions\\" and \\"special grounds\\" on which extra money could be charged. In 1830 the Inquisition at Rome decreed that in practice, confessors should no longer disturb lenders of money at legal interest. Slowly the church retreated from the many ways in which it dominated the economy. ;Chapter 20 From the Divine Oracles to the Higher Criticism During the Renaissance, Erasmus noticed that a reference to the Trinity in the first letter of John was not in early manuscripts and omitted it from his Greek testament. There was an outcry. Luther omitted the same passage. The great Jewish scholar Aben Ezra had discreetly questioned the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch in the 12th century and four centuries later a Catholic and a Protestant theologian both revived the idea but were suppressed. These ideas were revived by Spinoza a century later. By the early nineteenth century, it was shown in Germany that much of the Mosaic ceremonial law only dated from the exile period. Techniques of criticism developed for secular history were applied to the sacred. In 1860, Bishop Wilberforce, who had a few months before battled Huxley over evolution, turned on Essays and Reviews, which brought this thinking to England, creating a huge storm. By the end of the century, the same issues were facing the Catholic church. Meanwhile, the archeological results from Assyria and Egypt confirmed the radical readings of the Old Testament. Scholarship was also being brought to bear on the New Testament. Reception David C. Lindberg, historian of science, has written, ″No work—not even John William Draper's best-selling History of the Conflict between Religion and Science (1874)—has done more than White's to instill in the public mind a sense of the adversarial relationship between science and religion...His military rhetoric has captured the imagination of generations of readers, and his copious references, still impressive, have given his work the appearance of sound scholarship, bedazzling even twentieth-century historians who should know better.\\" He goes on, \\"Such judgments, however appealing they may be to foes of \\"scientific creationism\\" and other contemporary threats to established science, fly in the face of mounting evidence that White read the past through battle-scarred glasses, and that he and his imitators have distorted history to serve ideological ends of their own. Although it is not difficult to find instances of conflict and controversy in the annals of Christianity and science, recent scholarship has shown that the warfare metaphor to be neither useful or tenable in describing the relationship between science and religion.″ Historian of science Lawrence M. Principe writes, \\"No serious historians of science or of the science- religion issue today maintain the warfare thesis...The origins of the warfare thesis lie in the late 19th century, specifically in the work of two men - John William Draper and Andrew Dickson White. These men had specific political purposes in mind when arguing their case, and the historical foundations of their work are unreliable.\\" Principe goes on to write \\"Despite appearances, White’s arguments are scarcely any better than Draper’s. White uses fallacious arguments and suspect or bogus sources. His methodological errors are collectivism (the unwarrantable extension of an individual’s views to represent that of some larger group of which he is a part), a lack of critical judgement about sources, argument by ridicule and assertion, failure to check primary sources, and quoting selectively and out of context. White popularized the baseless notions that before Columbus and Magellan, the world was thought to be flat and that the Earth’s sphericity was officially opposed by the Church. He is also responsible for the equally fallacious notion that the Church forbade human dissection. The notion - eternally repopularized by Hollywood - that the medieval Church condemned all science as devilry runs throughout White; this view is likewise baseless.\\" In his course on science and religion, Principe points out a couple of examples of White's poor scholarship, \\"Let’s start with a simple and a notorious example: the idea that before Columbus people thought that the world was flat. Well, in fact, it is Draper and White, specifically, both of them, who bear most of the blame for popularizing this baseless view to the extent that nowadays, 80 percent of school teachers still foist this upon poor innocent school children. The fact is that of course the sphericity of the Earth was well established by the fifth century BC by the Greeks, and a good measure of its circumference made by the third century BC. And these facts were never forgotten in learned Western Culture.\\" Principe goes on to say, \\"White tells of a brave Columbus who fought mightily for the revolutionary notion of the earth’s sphericity. And here he helps us out (damning himself) with a footnote that reads “W. Irving, Life of Columbus” Yes, indeed, this is Washington Irving of Rip Van Winkle and headless horseman fame, who wrote a fictionalized account of Columbus in 1838. Yet White uses it as a historical source. This is an error of critical judgement.\\" Principe sums up White's book this way: \\"Refuting White is like shooting fish in a barrel. With his combination of bad sources, argument by assertion, quoting out of context, collectivism, and general reliance on exclamation, rather than evidence and argument, White’s is not a book to be taken seriously. Its real value is as a relic of its particular time and place, and as a museum of how not to write history...While we can look today with astonishment upon the shoddy character of Draper and White’s writings, their books have had enormous impact, and we can’t deny that. Much of this is due to their great success in their creating a myth for science as a religion. Their myth of science as a religion is replete with battles, and martyrdoms, and saints, and creeds. And as we know, or should know, myths are often much more powerful than historical realities.\\" The warfare motif which was popular in the 19th century has not worn well and most historians of science and religion have moved on from this. Current attitudes range over methodological naturalism and Gould's NOMA although the conflict is still found between creationists and scientists such as Richard Dawkins. Historian of science and self-confessed Christian, Ted Davis, has commented, \\"White was an historian himself, and for several generations his riveting narrative of enlightened and progressive science triumphing over ignorant and obscurantist theology set the tone for many other historical studies of science and religion. In the past few decades, however, historians of science have decisively rejected the ‘warfare’ view, along with many of the widely believed myths that White and Draper promulgated—such as the fictitious claim that John Calvin cited Psalm 93 against Nicolaus Copernicus or the wholly unfounded assertion that most Christians prior to Christopher Columbus believe in a flat earth. By insisting that all aspects of the history of science and religion must fit into one poorly chosen conceptual box, the ‘warfare’ view lied by gross oversimplification and led numerous scholars to overlook the large amount of historical material that just didn't fit into that box.\\" Historian of science and the son of a Seventh-day Adventist preacher (but currently a self-identifying agnostic) Ronald Numbers has stated, in a collection dealing with inaccuracies made by White and others, \\"Historians of science have known for years that White's and Draper's accounts are more propaganda than history.\\" Despite Christian writers' appeals that differences between science and religiosity have been resolved in a conciliatory manner, White's book was and continues to be a resounding and scholarly indictment of Draper's charge that \\"The history of Science is not a mere record of isolated discoveries; it is a narrative of the conflict of two contending powers, the expansive force of the human intellect on one side, and the compression arising from traditionary faith and human interests on the other.\\" Critical works In response to many of White's assertions, James Joseph Walsh wrote a historical response called The Popes and Science: The History of the Papal Relations to Science During the Middle Ages and Down to Our Own Time in 1908. text online References 7 John William Draper, History of the Conflict Religion, D.

The exhibits are intentionally devoid of descriptions and instead focuses on the interaction of form and function of the items. Visitors are encouraged to handle the objects and speculate on their use. The museum also features the Lichtbildpanoptikum, an integrated photo gallery featuring works by Vlad Korneev.

Homebrew software was first run on the PS3 by a group of hackers under the name \\"Team Ice\\" by exploiting a vulnerability in the game Resistance: Fall of Man. Following various other hacks executed from Linux, Sony removed the ability to install another operating system in the 3.21 firmware update. This event caused backlash among the hacker communities, and eventually the group Fail0verflow found a flaw in the generation of encryption keys which they leveraged to restore the ability to install Linux. George Hotz (Geohot) , often misattributed as the genesis of homebrew on the PS3, later created the first homebrew signed using the private \\"metldr\\" encryption key which he leaked onto the internet. The action of leaking the key led to Hotz being sued by Sony. The court case was settled out of court, with the result of George Hotz not being able to further reverse engineer the PS3. Private key compromised PlayStation 3 Free speech flag At the 2010 Chaos Communication Congress (CCC) in Berlin, a group calling itself fail0verflow announced it had succeeded in bypassing a number of the PlayStation 3's security measures, allowing unsigned code to run without a dongle. They also announced that it was possible to recover the Elliptic Curve DSA (ECDSA) private key used by Sony to sign software, due to a failure of Sony's ECDSA implementation to generate a different random number for each signature. However, fail0verflow chose not to publish this key because it was not necessary to run homebrew software on the device. The release of this key would allow anyone to sign their code and therefore be able to run it on any PlayStation 3 console. This would also mean that no countermeasures could be taken by Sony without rendering old software useless, as there would be no distinction between official and homebrew software. On January 3, 2011, geohot published the aforementioned private key, represented in hexadecimal as 46 DC EA D3 17 FE 45 D8 09 23 EB 97 E4 95 64 10 D4 CD B2 C2, as well as a Hello world program for the PS3. (original GeoHot posting to psx-scene with key and hello world program) On January 12, 2011, Sony Computer Entertainment America filed lawsuits against both fail0verflow and geohot for violations of the DMCA and CFAA. The suit against geohot was settled at the end of March, 2011, with geohot agreeing to a permanent injunction.Sony and George Hotz Settle PS3 Hacking LawsuitSettlement in George Hotz Case – PlayStation Blog Custom firmware (CFW) To allow for homebrew using the newly discovered encryption keys, several modified versions of system update 3.55 have been released by Geohot and others. The most common feature is the addition of an \\"App Loader\\" that allows for the installation of homebrew apps as signed DLC-like packages. Although Backup Managers could run at that time, they could not load games at first even though some success had been made by making backups look like DLC games and then signing them. An LV2 patch was later released to allow Backup Managers to load game backups and was later integrated into the Managers themselves so that it doesn't have to be run whenever the PS3 is restarted. PS3 System Software update 3.56 tried to patch Miha's exploit for 3.55, however, within a day the system was circumvented again. This caused Sony to release another update shortly after, 3.60, which was secure against circumvention. However, users may choose not to update and games requiring a firmware version above 3.55 can be patched to run on v3.55 or lower. Soon after v3.60 was released, updates to the PlayStation Network were conducted to block any methods known that allowed PSN access on firmware older than the latest required official firmware (v4.86 as of June 2020), thereby blocking users who chose not to update. A custom firmware known as \\"Rebug\\",The site rebug.me is credited in an April 26 Eurogamer.es report. released on March 31, 2011, gave retail PS3s most of the options and functionality of debug/developer PS3 units. One week later, tutorials became available allowing users to download PSN content for free, using fake (rather than stolen) credit card numbers. and linked articles One April 12 report described hackers using the jailbroken firmware to access the dev-PSN to get back on games like Call of Duty, with widespread reports of cheating. While some sources blamed Rebug for the subsequent intrusion to Sony's private developer network, Time \\"Techland\\" described such theories as \\"highly—as in looking down at the clouds from the tip-top of Mount Everest highly—speculative\\". In late 2017, there was a tool released to convert 4.82 PS3 OFW to CFW.

In 1985 it was purchased by Pierric Couderc, and underwent 3 years of restoration back to its original design. It was owned by Detours Limited, which was in turn owned by China Pub Company HK Ltd. It has a licensed capacity of 36 passengers. It is claimed to be the last authentic junk in Hong Kong, the other two junks operating in Hong Kong - the Aqua Luna and the V - being replicas of junks purpose-built for tourism in the 1990s and early 21st century. The Duk Ling foundered and sank in Aberdeen Typhoon Shelter in September 2014 due to strong winds and the storm surge from Typhoon Kalmaegi, which passed by Hong Kong. It was raised from an 18-meter depth in late December. Hong Kong-based yacht traders Yu Lik- hang and his aunt Cheng Ching-wah purchased and refurbished the salvaged hull at an estimated cost of 10 million yuan.

It is also used for cruises to Lamma Island, Lei Yue Mun and Po Toi, as well as weddings and wedding receptions. It has been featured in film versions of Around the World in 80 Days, Tai-Pan, and Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story as well as advertisements for Hong Kong. In October 2020, the Dukling's owner Hazen Tang said that it is struggling due to the COVID-19 downturn.

Early settlement  The area became the main town of the baHurutshe in 1849, when Kgosi Moiloa I settled it with about 1,500 people, who had been displaced following the Difaqane war. Moiloa was accompanied by the Reverend Walter Inglis of the London Missionary Society. In 1875, a succession dispute in the aftermath of Moiloa's death led to the displacement of many BaHurutshe, and nearly half of the population moved to Gopane.  Anti-apartheid history  Dinokana was the centre of the Bahurutshe resistance of the 1950s. Kgosi Abram Ramotshere Moiloa was bannished by the Apartheid Government in 1957 after he refused to enforce the carrying of passbooks by Hurutshe women as obliged by apartheid law. The women of Dinokana had largely refused to carry the passbooks, and Kgosi Moiloa had supported their decision. At the first meeting held by the native commissioner, 1000 women gathered but only 70 passbooks were taken out, Kgosi Moiloa was deposed a week later. Better known as the Zeerust uprising or the Hurutshe revolt, a popular uprising engulfed Lehurutshe in reaction to the punitive actions of the apartheid state, led particularly by the women of Lehurutse.  Bophuthatswana  In the 1980s, while the town was part of Bophuthatswana, a number of agricultural schemes were started close to Dinokana, and the town of Lehurutshe was built about 10 km away to resettle some of the villagers.Dinokana haa primary schools and high schools.

Individuals who obtained subsidies during the year must include this information when filing their income tax return the following April (U.S. tax returns are due on April 15 every year). In order to maintain coverage individuals must sign up every year during the open enrollment period. The open enrollment period for 2017 was November 1, 2016 until January 31, 2017. History The Washington Health Benefit Exchange (Exchange) was created in statute to meet a key provision of the Affordable Care Act that called for each state to establish a new marketplace that would offer health benefits to individuals, families, and small businesses. Under national health care reform, states were required to have an Exchange in place by Jan. 1, 2014. These new marketplaces were to be developed and implemented either by the state or by the United States Department of Health and Human Services. Washington State's governor and legislators chose to implement a state-based exchange model and, in 2011, passed legislation to establish the state's new marketplace as a \\"public- private partnership,\\" separate and distinct from the state. This legislation's strong governance model and public-private structure provided an innovative approach that other states would adopt in creating their own exchanges. The Exchange has a close working relationship with the Washington State Health Care Authority, Office of the Insurance Commissioner, and the Department of Social and Health Services. In 2012, legislation was passed that established market rules, requirements for qualified health plans (QHPs), essential health benefits, and other key elements of the state's Exchange. This legislation also enabled the Exchange to focus on developing its operations and information technology (IT) platform, which was critical to meeting the tight timeline of beginning operations on Oct. 1, 2013, the beginning of the first open enrollment period. Until the middle of 2015 insured individuals paid their premiums to the Washington Health Benefit Exchange, since then payments are made directly to the insurance company. The Exchange is responsible for the creation of Washington Healthplanfinder, the online portal to facilitate the shopping and enrolling in health and dental insurance.

A substantial amount of the grant funding was used to develop the IT system critical to determining eligibility for and enrolling residents in health plans. To determine eligibility appropriately, the IT system has essential integration points with state and federal agencies and carriers. The grant funding was also used to support activities, such as the development of the navigator program and a marketing campaign. Beginning in 2015, the Exchange was required to be self-sustaining and has been appropriated funds by the state legislature. The Exchange sustainability is tied to three funding sources established in statute: (1) the existing 2 percent tax on health insurance premiums sold through Washington Healthplanfinder; (2) reimbursement for activities performed on behalf of Washington Apple Health (the state's Medicaid program), and; (3) an agreed upon carrier assessment. The Exchange was provided with $110 million for operation in the recently passed 2015-17 biennial budget. Exchange governance The Exchange is run by an 11-member bipartisan board composed of a chair and eight voting members appointed by the Governor. Board members are nominated by the Republican and Democratic caucuses in both the State House and State Senate. The Exchange board must have expertise in a variety of health care areas including employee benefits, health economics, consumer advocacy, individual insurance, small group insurance, and health plan administration. The Director of the Health Care Authority and Insurance Commissioner are ex-officio, non-voting board members. There are currently 10 stakeholder committees, technical advisory committees, or workgroups, including a technical advisory committee for key program areas including the navigator program, agents and brokers, health equity, and outreach. There are also three workgroups that address plan management, consumers, and tribal issues. Customer support network Washington Healthplanfinder has a network of customer support across Washington State to help customers enroll in health and dental insurance.

History Le Grand Hôtel was built by the wealthy brothers Isaac & Émile Pereire and designed by Alfred Armand, who had previously designed the nearby Grand Hôtel du Louvre for them. Construction began in April 1861, and the hotel was inaugurated on 5 May 1862 by Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, before officially opening on 30 June 1862. The hotel's construction was part of the complete reconstruction of Paris supervised by Baron Haussmann at the time and it was built in the prescribed style, with a mansard roof. Filling an entire triangular city block, the hotel boasted 800 rooms on four floors for guests, with another whole floor for their servants. President Mac-Mahon visiting the Emperor and the Empress of Brazil, Pedro II and Teresa Cristina, at the Grand Hotel (L'Univers illustré: journal hebdomadaire, nº 1.153, 28 April 1877). The hotel has hosted royalty throughout its long history, including Tsar Nicholas and Tsarina Alexandra, King Edward VII of England and Queen Rania of Jordan. Victor Hugo hosted parties at the Le Grand Hotel and Émile Zola used the hotel for the setting of the death of his tragic character Nana.http://www.cafedelapaix.fr/maj/pdf/Press_Kit_InterContinental_Paris_Le_Grand_2013___EN.pdf In 1869, James Gordon Bennett, Jr., publisher of the Paris Herald, the forerunner of the International Herald Tribune, met with Henry Morton Stanley in the hotel's Imperial Suite to convince him to make his famous journey to Africa in search of David Livingstone. Creditors of the Péreire brothers seized the hotel in 1878, and in 1887, André Million formed Société du Grand Hôtel to manage Le Grand Hotel, along with the nearby Hotel Meurice and later the Hotel Prince de Galles. The Italian CIGA Hotels chain acquired the three hotels in 1972. CIGA sold the hotels in 1978 for $25 million to Limnico, a Liberia-based subsidiary of Roger Tamraz's First Arabian Corporation. Limnico resold the properties for $55 million just a year later, in October 1979, to Maxwell Joseph's UK-based Grand Metropolitan Hotels. Grand Metropolitan acquired the Inter-Continental Hotels chain in 1981, and placed Le Grand Hotel under their management. The hotel was renovated between 1985 and 1990 by noted French designer Pierre-Yves Rochon.http://parislegrand.intercontinental.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/Press- Kit-InterContinental-Paris-Le-Grand.pdf In 1986, the hotel was renamed Le Grand Hotel Inter-Continental Paris.https://www.verif.com/societe/GRAND-HOTEL- INTER-CONTINENTAL-PARIS-339196685/ The hotel closed in December 2001 for another major renovation.http://parislegrand.intercontinental.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/Press- Kit-InterContinental-Paris-Le-Grand.pdf Inter-Continental Hotels was reorganized as InterContinental Hotels Group while the hotel was closed, and it reopened on 5 April 2003,http://parislegrand.intercontinental.com/assets/uploads/2017/11/Press- Kit-InterContinental-Paris-Le-Grand.pdf with its name modified slightly, as InterContinental Paris Le Grand Hotel. InterContinental sold the hotel to Qatar-based Constellation Hotels in 2014 for €330 million, although InterContinental continues to manage the property. Café de la Paix The renowned Café de la Paix has been located on the ground floor of the hotel since it opened. In popular culture Roman Polanski set much of his 1988 film Frantic, starring Harrison Ford, at the hotel.

It was established in 1897 in the United States. In the early 21st century, it has 500,000 members and 1500 lodges in the world.  History  The Order claims descent from the Free African Society, the first formal black society in America, founded in 1787 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania as a mutual aid society by Absalom Jones and Richard Allen. That organization later resulted in the founding of the first African-American congregation in the Episcopal Church, headed by Jones, and the founding of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the first independent black denomination, by Allen. The formation of the Improved BPOE as a separate order, however, began in February 1897, when it was established in Cincinnati, Ohio, by city residents B. F. Howard and Arthur J. Riggs. The latter was a Pullman porter who had been born into slavery. The men had met in another fraternal association and wanted to establish a chapter of Elks; the white organization refused them admission.\\"Our Brief History\\", IBPOEW official website (Note: In 1972 the white-majority BPOE opened admission to African Americans and other minorities.) Riggs had gained a copy of the BPOE ritual and received the first copyright for it, establishing their organization in September 1898.Schmidt, Alvin J. Fraternal Organizations, Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1980, pp. 107-8 The first meeting of the new IBPOEW organization was held on Thursday, November 17, 1898. This was a period of a rise in black fraternal associations, with men organizing to work in community and create strong networks. The BPOE disputed the African Americans' use of the ritual, but they held the copyright. In 1912 the Improved, Benevolent Protective Order of Elks of the World was sued by the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks in the State of New York to keep them from using the \\"Elks\\" name. The New York Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the BPOE, with Judge Barlett stating, \\"If the members desired the name of an animal there is a long list of beasts, birds, fishes which have not yet been appropriated for such a purpose.\\"Preuss, Arthur. A Dictionary of Secret and other Societies, St. Louis: B. Herder Book Co., 1924; republished Detroit: Gale Reference Company, 1966; p.206 The decision was apparently ignored after the IBPOEW made a minor change in the letters on their seal.Schmidt (1980), p.108 The IBPOEW founded a Civil Liberties department in 1926. It was active in opposing the segregation of schools in Gary, Indiana, the next year. The number of blacks in the city had increased markedly during the Great Migration, as men were attracted from the rural South to the city's industrial jobs. At the same time, there were also numerous European immigrants settling in the city. During the 1930s and 1940s, the IBPOEW was active in the effort of blacks to \\"gain work while resisting union exclusion, workplace segregation, and unemployment.\\"Venus Green, \\"Not your average fraternal organization: the IBPOEW and labor activism, 1935–1950\\", Labor History, Volume 53, 2012 - Issue 4, pp.471-494, Taylor and Francis Online; accessed 17 May 2017 According to historian Venus Green, the Improved Elks labor activism was distinguished from other black fraternal organizations by their \\"cross-class alliances, male/female solidarity, racial unity, a willingness to join coalitions across ideologies and to engage in multiple forms of struggle, especially militant mass mobilization\\". In the IBPOEW, ideologies ranged from Christianity to communism, but the members worked together to achieve labor goals. The Kennedy Farm meeting hall From 1950 to 1966, the IBPOEW owned and operated as their National Shrine \\"The John Brown Farm\\" (also known as \\"The Kennedy Farm\\") in southern Washington County, Maryland. That property was the site where John Brown had trained his troops in anticipation of his raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859; this was a catalyst for the Civil war and the abolition of slavery. The Elks purchased the property as a memorial to Brown and built several buildings on the 235-acre property, including a 50' by 124' auditorium that was used as a meeting place for Elks gatherings of up to three thousand persons on Fourth of July and Labor Day weekends. The auditorium was rented on summer weekends by a local black entrepreneur, John Bishop, who booked into that venue dozens of the biggest stars of rhythm and blues, including Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Marvin Gaye, Little Richard, Chuck Berry, B. B. King, Eartha Kitt, Otis Redding, Etta James, the Coasters, and the Drifters.Maliskas, Ed. John Brown to James Brown - The Little Farm Where Liberty Budded, Blossomed, and Boogied, Hagerstown, MD: Hamilton Run Press, 2016 The order's historical importance as a place of activism continues to be a central aspect of its public image, that has even reached the interest of scholars and historians.  Organization  The organization and titles of the Improved Elks are reportedly modeled on that of the BPOE. Its Grand Lodge meets annually, and the organization is headquartered in Winton, North Carolina. Like the BPOE, the Improved Elks have an officially recognized female auxiliary, the Daughters of the Improved Benevolent Protective Order of Elks of the World.Schmidt (1980), p. 107 They were organized by Emma Virginia Kelly on June 13, 1902, in Norfolk, Virginia. In 1923 the IBPOEW convention in Chicago was attended by 3,000 delegates. At that meeting J. Finley Wilson was re-elected \\"Grand Exalted Leader'.Preuss p.179  Problems  At least two lodges have been reported to operate as nightclubs, in Fort Pierce (FL) and Washington, D.C. This occurred in part as a way of \\"getting more members back in,\\" in order to avoid financial straits. In at least one occasion, this has produced problems in the lodge's neighborhoods. A board member called the D.C. incident 'extremely, extremely disturbing,' \\"expressing the board’s concern that the lodge was behaving more like a rowdy nightclub than the benevolent and protective order that the organization’s name suggests.\\"  Membership  In 1979 the Improved Elks had approximately 450,000 members. In the early 21st century, they have 500,000 members in 1500 lodges around the world. Like other fraternal associations in the United States, both black and white, the Improved Elks have been dealing with declining membership as older members die. Younger people face a different world, and seem less inclined to join such associations,Michelle O'Donnell, \\"Black Elks Honor Rituals as Membership Dwindles\\", New York Times, 20 September 2004; accessed 17 May 2017 sometimes preferring explicitly political or professional associations related to work.  Ritual  Just like the BPOE, the Improved Elks have kept much of their original ritual intact.  Benefits and philanthropy  The Improved Elks in the United States sponsor scholarship programs, youth summer computer literacy camps, help for children with special needs, and extensive community service activities.

He graduated BA in 1815, when he was Eighth Wrangler, and the same year was elected a Fellow of his college. The next year he was ordained a deacon of the Church of England, and in 1818 a priest. Also in 1818 he proceeded to the degree of MA and in 1828 was appointed Master of Pembroke College, later the same year becoming Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge for the year. In 1829 the University made him a Doctor of Divinity.

Since 2013, it led to a series of conferences exploring the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons, culminating in the Humanitarian Pledge, issued by the Austrian Government, to \\"fill the legal gap for the prohibition and elimination of nuclear weapons\\". The Pledge has been endorsed by 108 governments as of 1 June 2015. The Humanitarian Initiative is seen as a direct answer to the lack of progress in nuclear disarmament. Origins The 2010 NPT Review Conference was formally successful, and concluded with 188 state parties adopting a consensus document, including language on the catastrophic humanitarian consequences any use of nuclear weapons would have: :\\"The Conference expresses its deep concern at the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons and reaffirms the need for all States at all times to comply with applicable international law, including international humanitarian law.\\"The 2010 NPT Final Document hosted by the United Nations This language was interpreted as a mandate to take forward the humanitarian perspective on nuclear weapons. At the next NPT conference, which was held in Vienna in 2012, Switzerland therefore delivered the \\"Joint Statement on the humanitarian dimension of nuclear disarmament\\" to the first session of the preparatory committee to the 2015 NPT Review Conference. The statement, delivered on 2 May 2012, was joined by 16 states.The 2012 statement can be found at Reaching Critical Will On 22 October of the same year, Benno Laggner, the Head of the Task Force on Nuclear Disarmament and Non-Proliferation of the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, delivered a very similar version of the statement to the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.

The meeting's Chair, Ambassador Cornel Feruta of Romania, dubbed the established group the \\"Humanitarian Initiative\\".Johnson, Rebecca: NPT and risks to human survival: the inside story, 29 April 2013 Later in 2013, 125 states joined New Zealand's iteration of the same statement in the UN General Assembly, and 155 states at the UNGA First Committee on 20 October 2014.Joint Statement on the Humanitarian Consequences of Nuclear Weapons delivered by Ambassador Dell Higgie of New Zealand On 28 April 2015, 159 states formed part of the initiative, over 80 percent of the United Nations membership. The statements of the Humanitarian Initiative are still drafted by the 16 original states and coordinated by the Swiss Department of Foreign Affairs. At the same time, a group of 16 other states - all of which rely on extended nuclear deterrence under the U.S. \\"nuclear umbrella\\" - read a competing statement on the humanitarian consequences. This statement was notable by the absence of the phrase, \\"It is in the interest of the very survival of humanity that nuclear weapons are never used again, under any circumstances.\\" Especially this last phrase had been objected to by NATO states and other U.S. allies generally susceptible to arguments of international humanitarian law. The states explained that in order to keep nuclear deterrence, they needed to stand by a credible threat to use nuclear weapons under specific circumstances, and could therefore not endorse the statement of the original humanitarian initiative. However, 26 of these states joined a variant of the humanitarian statement, traditionally delivered by Australia, called the \\"Humanitarian Consequences Group\\".  Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons conferences  = Oslo conference = On 4 and 5 March 2013, the first-ever Conference on the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons was hosted by NATO-member Norway, attended by 127 states. At the conference, scientists presented new findings on the impact of nuclear weapons on humans, cities, the environment and global climate. Humanitarian organisations including UNDP, OCHA and the ICRC explained that in the event of a nuclear detonation, no organisation in the world would be able to provide adequate help, nor was it likely that an adequate capacity could be built. The conference greatly contributed to the momentum around the discussion on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons, with Mexico announcing a follow-up conference.The conference and Mexico's announcement at the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs = Nayarit conference = The second conference was held in Nayarit, Mexico, on 13–14 February 2014 and drew 146 states, international and humanitarian organisations as well as civil society coordinated by the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons. In addition to the topics of the Oslo meeting, the conference also discussed the risk of accidental detonations, or the use of nuclear weapons by miscalculation. In the Chair's summary of the meeting, the Mexican Government noted that: > «The effects of a nuclear weapon detonation are not constrained by national > borders − it is therefore an issue of deep concern shared by all. (...) > Today the risk of nuclear weapons use is growing globally as a consequence > of proliferation, the vulnerability of nuclear command and control networks > to cyber-attacks and to human error, and potential access to nuclear weapons > by non-state actors, in particular terrorist groups. As more countries > deploy more nuclear weapons on higher levels of combat readiness, the risks > of accidental, mistaken, unauthorized or intentional use of these weapons > grow significantly. (...) It is a fact that no State or international > organization has the capacity to address or provide the short and long term > humanitarian assistance and protection needed in case of a nuclear weapon > explosion. Moreover, it would not be possible to establish such capacities, > even if attempted. (...) > We need to take into account that, in the past, weapons have been eliminated > after they have been outlawed. We believe this is the path to achieve a > world without nuclear weapons. In our view, this is consistent with our > obligations under international law, including those derived from the NPT as > well as from Common Article 1 to the Geneva Conventions. (...) The broad- > based and comprehensive discussions on the humanitarian impact of nuclear > weapons should lead to the commitment of States and civil society to reach > new international standards and norms, through a legally binding instrument. > It is the view of the Chair that the Nayarit Conference has shown that time > has come to initiate a diplomatic process conducive to this goal (...) > making the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons the essence of disarmament > efforts. > It is time to take action. The 70th anniversary of the Hiroshima and > Nagasaki attacks is the appropriate milestone to achieve our goal. Nayarit > is a point of no return.» = Vienna conference = The Vienna Conference on the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons was hosted by the Austrian Government on 8–9 December 2014. For the first time, Western states armed with nuclear weapons also attended the conference, with representatives from the United States and he United Kingdom. The French government declined to attend, while India and Pakistan had already attended the prior meetings. China sent a high-ranking diplomat, but only in observer capacity (i.e. accredited as 'academic'). In addition to a reiteration of the evidence on the humanitarian impact of nuclear detonations and nuclear testing, and scientific analysis of the risk of such detonations occurring, the Vienna Conference also included a panel on the contributions of international humanitarian law, international environmental law, to the legal status of nuclear weapons. Pope Francis also sent a personal message to the conference, calling for nuclear disarmament.Pope Francis urges world towards nuclear disarmament, Vatican Radio, 9 December 2014. The Vatican used this opportunity to rebalance its position on nuclear weapons, judging that nuclear deterrence \\"can no longer be deemed a policy that stands firmly on moral ground.\\" = Outlook = The series of conferences, renewed attention for the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons and the Austrian Pledge have all increased expectations for the 2015 NPT Review Conference. It is rumoured that a follow-up conference to the Vienna Conference could be hosted by South Africa or Brazil. In the summary of the Mexican conference, Juan Manuel Gomez- Robledo, Mexico's deputy Foreign Minister had called for negotiations on a new legal instrument for the prohibition of nuclear weapons to commence around the 70th anniversary of the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, i.e. in August 2015. The Humanitarian Pledge At the close of the Vienna conference on the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons, and alongside the Chair's summary, the Austrian Government issued the Austrian Pledge in its national capacity, in which recalled the \\"legal gap for the prohibition and elimination of nuclear weapons\\". Austria therefore \\"pledges to cooperate with all relevant stakeholders, States, international organisations, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movements, parliamentarians and civil society, in efforts to stigmatise, prohibit and eliminate nuclear weapons in light of their unacceptable humanitarian consequences and associated risks.\\" The Austrian Pledge was a major development in the run up to the 2015 Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which reviews the implementation of the treaty in a five-yearly cycle. Before the conference, 66 states had endorsed the Pledge. During the conference, the perceived intransigence of nuclear weapon states and uncertain prospects for a consensus outcome pushed a growing number of states to endorse the Pledge. Austria reacted by \\"internationalising\\" the Pledge, renaming it Humanitarian Pledge. By the end of the conference, 107 states had endorsed it, which was hailed by civil society as \\"the real outcome\\" of the NPT review. The Humanitarian Pledge has been endorsed by 108 states as of 1 June 2015. The humanitarian dimension of nuclear disarmament The Humanitarian Initiative carries forward the focus on the humanitarian dimension of nuclear disarmament, which focuses on the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons rather than on the security dimension that a minority of states attributes to them.Article 36: 79 states issue humanitarian statement at Non-Proliferation Treaty PrepCom Since all states have to abide by international humanitarian law at all times, it is questionable whether nuclear weapons can ever be used lawfully, in view of their indiscriminate and disproportionate effects, and the need to refrain from attacks that do not fit these requirements, in line with the principle of precaution. In 1996, the International Court of Justice stated in its advisory opinion on nuclear weapons that \\"it is difficult to envisage how any use of nuclear weapons could be compatible with the requirements of international humanitarian law,\\" but declined to issue an opinion on the \\"policy of deterrence\\" or to conclude that \\"recourse to nuclear weapons would be illegal in any circumstance.\\"Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons , Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, International Court of Justice. In light of the evidence gathered by the three conferences on the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons, the ICRC has strengthened its position, calling the prohibition and elimination of nuclear weapons a \\"humanitarian imperative\\". Author Eric Schlosser, in his 2013 book \\"Command and Control,\\" described accidents involving nuclear weapons and argued that the number and severity was greater than officially acknowledged. A document obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request contained information on over one thousand accidents involving nuclear weapons in the United States, between 1950 and 1968, although many of them were \\"trivial.\\" Controversy The statement has generated controversy in states under the US nuclear umbrella but especially critical of nuclear weapons. The German foreign minister announced Germany would seek out ways to join the statement at a future iteration.Letter by German foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle to the Chair of the Subcommittee on Disarmament and Arms Control in the German Federal Parliament, Uta Zapf In Japan, much attention was given to the Nagasaki Mayor Tomihisa Taue, who among others attacked the government for failing to join the Humanitarian Initiative.David McNeill: Nagasaki Mayor attacks Abe for ‘betraying’ world over nuclear weapons, The Independent Japan's Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida subsequently stated it was \\"quite regrettable\\" his country had not joined the statement.Kyodo News International: Obama's possible Hiroshima visit meaningful for disarmament: Kishida, 6 August 2013 Kishida later announced Japan's decision to sign the next iteration of the statement,NHK, Japanese broadcaster: Japan to sign UN anti-nuclear statement, 11 October 2013 after public pressure by NGOs and the mayor of Nagasaki increased.NHK, Japanese broadcaster: Why Japan did not sign past statements, 11 Oct 2013 Four members of NATO as well as five members of the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative have thus far joined the initiative. Japan has come under similar pressure for announce that it will not endorse the Austrian Pledge. Similarly, NATO-states have come under increasing pressure to justify their reluctance to engage with the arguments of the humanitarian initiative. Former Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans also criticized the Australian government sharply for staying away from the statement, after documents obtained by the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons under the Freedom of Information Act showed Australian opposition to efforts towards nuclear disarmament.The Age: ALP nuclear backflip linked to US defence, 2 October 2013 The Australian government drew heavy criticism for its diplomatic attempts to undermine the New Zealand-led humanitarian initiative statements, and the possibility of a treaty banning nuclear weapons in the near term. Members of the Initiative Austrian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sebastian Kurz delivered the statement of the Humanitarian Initiative at the 2015 Review Conference on the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, on 28 April 2015, speaking on behalf of 159 states. This has been described as \\"the biggest cross-regional joint declaration ever on a substantive issue in the UN context\\".

Primarily used for Minor League Baseball, it is the home of the El Paso Chihuahuas of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League. Opened in 2014, the facility has an official capacity of 9,500, with 7,500 fixed seats with the rest being berm and party deck standing room sections. The name \\"Southwest University\\" is applied as a corporate sponsor, and not as the home stadium of the University (which has no intercollegiate athletics program; the university is a for- profit virtual college). Southwest University Park was named as the best new ball park in 2014 by Ballpark Digest. The elevation of the playing field is approximately above sea level. History The complex is situated upon the site of El Paso's former City Hall, which was demolished by implosion on April 14, 2013, to make way for the stadium. Former El Paso Mayor Ray Salazar had filed a 2013 lawsuit to stop the demolition of the old City Hall, alleging the misuse of public funds by city officials, but the lawsuit was dismissed in court. Ground for the ballpark was broken on May 30, 2013 with 300 people attending the event, including members of MountainStar Sports Group, the ownership group of the El Paso Pacific Coast League team, Pat O'Conner, president and CEO of Minor League Baseball, and City Representatives Ann Morgan Lilly, Susie Byrd, Cortney Niland, and Steve Ortega. On March 5, 2014, it was announced that the team had signed a 20-year naming rights deal for the ballpark with Southwest University, an El Paso based business and technical school known until 2012 as Southwest Career College.Daniel Borunda, \\"El Paso Chihuahuas ballpark to be named Southwest University Park\\", El Paso Times, March 6, 2014.

In August 2018, Southwest University Park was awarded the title of \\"Best View in the Minors\\" by Minor League Baseball fans. The El Paso park topped Peoples Natural Gas Field, home of the Altoona Curve, and Modern Woodmen Park, home of the Quad Cities River Bandits, in the voting. Features The design theme is based on the Union Depot and incorporates architectural details found in the region's historic buildings, such as the Kress Building in Downtown El Paso.

Family  Bodrugan was the son and heir of Sir Roger de Bodrugan (d. 1277) by Isolda (d.1311), later wife of Sir Henry de Pomeroy (d. 1281) and Sir Walter de Aylesbury, daughter of Symon de Pyn. Isolda's great uncle was the Seneschal and High Sheriff of Cornwall, Sir Stephen Haym, one of the founding canons of Glasney College. When his father died Henry was still under aged and his wardship went to Sir William de Alneto. On 19 May 1277 Henry's wardship was purchased by his uncle, William Bodrugan, later Provost of Glasney, and Archdeacon of Cornwall. Henry became the heir of both his uncle, William, and his great uncle, Reginald. In 1287 he married Sybil de Mandeville (29 September 1264–c.1307) daughter of an unknown Mandeville and his wife Alice Giffard. Sybil's grandparents were Hugh Giffard and Sibyl, daughter and co- heiress of Walter de Cormeilles. From 1239 until his death in 1246 Hugh was responsible for raising the young prince, later King, Edward I. Sybil's maternal uncles were the Lord Chancellors of England, Walter Giffard, Archbishop of York, and Godfrey Giffard, Bishop of Worcester. Her aunt Mabel was the Abbess of Shaftesbury Abbey. Sybil was the widow of Peter le Poer (d. 4 April 1283), likely related to Eustace le Poer who, together with Thomas de Mandeville, brought an army from Ireland to Scotland to fight for Edward I of England. Sybil was lady of the Queen's chamber to Eleanor of Castile and her children were still with the Queen's children in 1289–90. She was buried in Glasney College and her son Sir Otto paid for the Bodrugan Chantry to be built there in his parents' honour. Henry and Sybil had two children: *Otto, married Margaret Champernowne (d. 1360). *Joan (b. 1285), married Sir Henry Champernowne. These children and their spouses feature heavily in the novel The House on the Strand by Daphne du Maurier.  Landowner  His principal residence appears to have been at Bodrugan, near Goran, with others at Pendrym and Tregrehan. At his death he owned the manors of Bodrugan, Pendrym, Trethem, Tretheak, Treworrick, Tremodret, Trevellion, Tregrehan, Trethew and Lantyan Parva. The large manor of Restronguet was held by his mother, who did not die until 1311. Henry had already given away the manor of Trelawne to his daughter on her marriage. The manor of Markwell, which belonged to his uncle William, was given to William's illegitimate daughter, but eventually returned to Henry's son Otto. In addition to these manors he held other lands and tenements across Cornwall. He held some property in Ireland through his wife who was named heir to her brother Walter in 1288. The Mandevilles were important sub-tenants of the earldom of Ulster and, between 1300 and 1304, Edward I issued numerous letters of nomination for Henry's attorneys in Ireland (his brothers John and Peter, and John le Fugheler). In 1305 John le Poer, baron of Doneyl in Waterford, and Sibyl's son by her first marriage, was found owing Henry £200. The sheriff of Waterford was commanded by the king to levy £50 of the lands and chattels of John le Poer of the £200. Through her brother he also came to hold 1/6 of the manor of Luton, Bedfordshire which Walter had exchanged for portions of the manors of Eltham, Woolwich and Mottingham. When Sybil died these Mandeville estates passed to her son by her first marriage.  Political career  He was a Member (MP) of the Parliament of England for Cornwall in 1307. In 1284 he was one of the Justices of Assize for Cornwall, and in 1302 he was a juror at the assizes. In 1309, months after his death, he was summoned to parliament as a baron. As he could not sit in that parliament his descendants were unable to claim the title of baron.  Military career  In 1286 Henry joined Edward I on an expedition to Gascony. In April he was given permission to go \\"beyond the seas\\" for one year with Robert Burnell, Bishop of Bath and Wells, Edmund Crouchback and others. After sailing to northern France in mid-May they reached Gascony by August. Henry was knighted by 1289, perhaps as a result of his participation in the expedition. As there is no record of him serving in Wales, he was probably part of the 1294 expedition to Gascony with John of Brittany and William Latymer. From 1300 Henry became involved in Edward's Scottish wars, his coat of arms is features as No. 227 in the Galloway Roll. In September 1302 the king issued a pardon to Henry's retinue, his younger brothers Peter and John, Adam de Markwell (married to Henry's uncle's illegitimate daughter), Serlo Wyse and John le Fugheler for crimes they had committed \\"in consideration of their service in Gascony and Scotland\\". The crimes were the retaliatory measures the men had taken after Henry was attacked by Thomas Lercedekne and Ralph de Bloyou at the house of William Bloyou at Glasney.

His research has examined the fossil record of soils though major events in Earth history, extending back some 4.6 billion years. Among his publications he has written two standard paleopedology textbooks, said N. Jones in Nature Geoscience \\"Retallack has literally written the book on ancient soils.\\"  Biography  Retallack moved with his family from Hobart, Tasmania at age 4. He grew up in Hurstville and then Epping, in the suburbs of Sydney. He attended The King's School, Parramatta, then studied biology and paleontology at Macquarie University. He received a BSc Hons with University Medal in 1974 from the University of New England (Australia) and a PhD in 1978 in geology from the same university. After a postdoctoral fellowship at Indiana University he joined the faculty at the University of Oregon in 1981. He has been a professor in the Department of Geological Sciences since 1992, and Director of the Condon Collection of the University of Oregon Museum of Natural and Cultural History since 2009. Retallack on Mount Cook, New Zealand, 1974  Work  = Evolution of life on land = In 1973, Retallack discovered that paleosols were preserved among fossil roots below some kinds of fossil plant horizons and that paleosols could reveal aspects of plant communities difficult to infer from the fossil plants themselves. This novel approach to reconstructing life on land could be applied to understanding major events in evolution, sometimes supplementing and sometimes challenging prior understanding. Initial work was on Triassic vegetation and climate. Later construction of Cenozoic paleoclimate time series led to the idea that grassland-grazer coevolution was responsible for climatic cooling over the past 50 million years, which has implications for biosequestration of carbon. Fieldwork in Kenya on paleosols associated with apes (Proconsulidae) ancestral to humans revealed that the evolutionary transition to upright stance occurred in woodlands rather than savannas. Paleosols of the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary in Montana implicated abrupt paleoclimatic change and acid rain from extraterrestrial impact in the extinction of dinosaurs Work on the Permian- Triassic boundary in Antarctica lead to formulation of an hypothesis of greenhouse crisis due to methane outburst associated with flood basalt in this greatest of all mass extinctions Devonian fossil soils at sites for tetrapods suggest a woodland hypothesis for the evolutionary transition from fish to amphibian. Retallack discovered fossil soils at classical South Australian sites for the Ediacara biota and reported it is evidence that these fossils formerly regarded as marine were instead terrestrial organisms such as lichens, slime molds and microbial colonies. Retallack has also reinterpreted volcanic tuffs of Newfoundland as terrestrial lapilli and sanidine tuffs, and so found fossiliferous Ediacaran paleosols there as well A Paleoproterozoic paleosol with problematic fossils (Diskagma) comparable to the living Geosiphon (a fungus) could suggest a long evolutionary history for life on land. Such putative ancient and complex life on land could support the view that life originated in soil. In 2013, Retallack reported in the journal Precambrian Research that land-based microfossils found in South Africa could be as old as 2.2 billion years, pushing back the arrival of life on land much further breaking the previous record of 1.2 billion years. Reprinted in ScientificAmerican.com Oligocene fossil soils of well-drained woodlands (red bands) and swamps (black spots) in the Painted Hills, Oregon Retallack's work on Late Permian mass extinction was featured on several television documentaries, including the BBC's The Day The Earth Nearly Died and Science Channel USA's Miracle Planet episode \\"Death and Rebirth\\". His work on Miocene of Panama was featured in National Geographic Channel USA's \\"Terror Raptor\\" episode of Prehistoric Predators. Radio interviews concerning his recent work on early life on land were broadcast by Richard Harris for National Public Radio, Bob McDonald for Canadian Broadcast Corporation and Dave Miller for Oregon Public Broadcasting. In a challenge to young earth creationism, Retallack debunked interpretation of the fossil forests of Yellowstone National Park as deposits of volcanic lahars in which tree trunks landed upright, by showing that the fossil stumps were rooted in moderately developed paleosols. Because moderate development of soils can take as long as 5000 years, only a few paleosols in succession are needed to exceed the young earth creationism age of the Earth, and at Yellowstone there are at least 24 successive fossil forests. Sequences of paleosols is just one of many lines of physical evidence that young earth creationism does not explain as well as conventional geology. = Paleobotany = In addition to paleopedology, Retallack continues research in paleobotany. His special interests include Triassic fossil plants such as Pleuromeia, Isoetes, Dicroidium and Lepidopteris. With David Dilcher he developed a coastal hypothesis for the dispersal and rise to dominance of angiosperms. Retallack also developed new techniques for using stomatal index of fossil Ginkgo leaves to obtain past atmospheric carbon dioxide. This work led Retallack to propose the concept of paleoenvironmental regulation by the Proserpina Principle: plants cool the planet, whereas animals warm it. Retallack's name is honored by several fossils including Cladophlebis retallackii, fossil fern foliage, Sapindopsis retallackii early angiosperm leaves and Hypisodus retallacki, a fossil mouse deer. Paleosols (massive red bands) at horizons for Ediacaran fossils in Brachina Gorge, South Australia. = Archeology = In a study of soils at 84 temples of Classical Greece, Retallack discovered that each deity and cult was associated with a particular kind of soil, suggesting an economic basis for Greek polytheism. Dionysos and Demeter, for example, were gods of farming, Hermes and Hera gods of pastoralists and Apollo and Artemis gods of nomadic hunter-gatherers  Boards  Retallack has served as an associate or technical editor for such scientific journals as Geology, PALAIOS, and Journal of Sedimentary Research. His fellowships include the Geological Society of America, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He served as the president and vice president of the Cordilleran Section of the Paleontological Society, of the Oregon Academy of Sciences, and of the University of Oregon Chapter of the Society of Sigma Xi.  Critical reception  Early reviews of Retallack's textbooks have been positive. Of Soils of the Past, David Fastovsky concludes \\"it is requisite for all persons trying to understand paleosols\\". Of A Colour Guide to Paleosols, Daniel Yaalon concludes \\"Highly recommended for students and researchers alike for an introductory insight to paleopedology and to whet and refine their skills in paleosol interpretation.\\" Both reviews however baulked at the unfamiliarity of soil science terminology and classification in these texts. Retallack's approach to the description and interpretation of paleosols has been widely adopted. Some controversy concerned use of modern soil taxonomies for paleosols, but Retallack's approach has since been validated by development of additional geochemical proxies for soil taxonomic criteria. Retallack's confirmation of abrupt paleoenvironmental change on land at the Cretaceous-Tertiary and Permian-Triassic boundaries, have been supported by later research on extinction. Retallack's initial taphonomy work interpreting some Ediacaran biota as lichens was questioned for its applicability to all Ediacaran fossils. The recent Retallack proposal that Ediacaran fossils were preserved in paleosols and thus could not be marine fossils, is a provocative challenge to prior interpretations, and has been supported in some quarters, but disputed in others. However this hypothesis of Retallack is not universally accepted by the paleontological community. Nature called it a \\"controversial claim\\" in a news report, in which paleontologist Guy Narbonne said \\"Most of us appreciated that Retallack's lichen hypothesis was innovative thinking and tested his ideas critically, but it quickly became clear that there are simpler explanations for the features Retallack had validly noted, and most of us moved on to more promising explanations.\\"  Awards and honors  Retallack has been honored for his research, including the Stillwell Award of the Geological Society of Australia, for best paper in the society journal in 1977, and the Antarctica Service Medal of the U.S. National Science Foundation in 1999. He has been an invited lecturer throughout the U.S., and also to Germany, England, China, Thailand and India.

In 2016, his colleagues named him the House Democratic Leader, in which capacity he succeeded former Representative John Bel Edwards of Tangipahoa Parish, the incoming governor of Louisiana. Background A native of Shreveport, Reynolds is one of six children of the late Harlie Reynolds and Elizabeth Reynolds, since Elizabeth Woods. He was reared in the lower-middle-class neighborhood, later predominantly African American, known as Cedar Grove. In 1968, he graduated from Woodlawn High School in Shreveport. After his graduation, his parents relocated to Ringgold in Bienville Parish, where he met his future wife, the former Martha Nell Moore. Thereafter, Reynolds worked in industry but returned to school and graduated in 1977 with a bachelor's degree in elementary education from Louisiana Tech University in Ruston. He subsequently obtained graduate credentials from Louisiana Tech in 1982 and 1992. Gene and Martha Reynolds were employed for nearly three decades by the Webster Parish School Board. From 1994 to 1998, he was principal in Sarepta. In 1994, he chaired the Webster Parish sex education curriculum writing committee.Pat Culverhouse, \\"Sex ed program implemented for sophomores; 7th, 8th grade plan on hold,\\" Minden Press-Herald, January 25, 1994, p. 1. School Superintendent Jerry Lott said at the time that the work compiled by Reynolds' committee \\"emphasizes abstinence\\".Virgie Davis, \\"Board Approves Sex Ed Curriculum\\", Minden Press- Herald, February 23, 1994, p. 1 He later helped to start the combination Lakeside Junior High and High School south of Sibley. In the aftermath of Hurricane Rita in 2005, the Reynolds temporarily relocated to Cameron Parish in southwestern Louisiana. They returned in 2010 to Webster Parish to reside in Dubberly near their son, Dustin, and his family. Dustin Reynolds, who carries no partisan affiliation, was an unsuccessful candidate for Minden city marshal in the December 6, 2014 runoff election in which he faced the incumbent Democrat Jack R. \\"Randy\\" Shelley, who had led a three-candidate field in the primary election by nearly four hundred votes. In the second round of balloting, Shelley prevailed with 55.5 percent of the vote. Legislative career Reynolds won the District 10 seat in the general election held on November 19, 2011, when he defeated the Republican candidate, Jerri Ray de Pingre (born January 1959) of Minden, also a former educator and later the director of the local Chamber of Commerce, 4,232 (54.7 percent) to 3,508 (45.3 percent). In 2012, de Pingre was elected to the District 10 seat on the Louisiana Republican State Central Committee. Two other Republicans, Gerald Holland, a retired banker from Springhill and a former parish party chairman,\\"GOP head to speak\\", Minden Press-Herald, March 31, 1976, p. 1 and Ronnie Broughton of Minden, a past president and a member of the Webster Parish School Board, had been eliminated in the nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 22. Broughton thereafter left the GOP and is chairman of the state Constitution Party. He is also one of the few Constitution Party members holding any public office in Louisiana. Reynolds was endorsed by his predecessor in the office, the term-limited Democrat, Jean Doerge of Minden, who had served since 1998, when she won a special election to succeed her late husband, Representative Everett Doerge. Both Doerges were also educators. Broughton, eliminated in the 2011 primary, had lost the 2007 election to Jean Doerge. Reynolds is a member of the House committees on (1) Commerce, (2) Education, and (3) Retirement. In the 2012 legislative session, Reynolds voted against proposals to increase the number of charter schools, establish school vouchers, and to amend the state's teacher tenure policy. In 2013, Reynolds voted for a judicial pay raise, which the legislature approved. He favored the removal of term limits on judges, but that amendment failed in the House. He supported a state law which now requires that women working for the state receive the same pay as men in the same job, something already required under a federal provision in 1963. He voted for surrogacy contracts for couples designating another woman to bear their child, a measure approved by the legislature. Reynolds voted with the House majority to oppose reducing the penalties for possession of marijuana, to prohibit state enforcement of federal firearm regulations on weapon manufacturers, and to prohibit the publication of the names of persons with concealed weapon permits. He also voted to authorize lifetime concealed weapon permits. In all of these votes, Reynolds' positions were identical to those of his Republican colleague from District 9, Rob Shadoin of Ruston. The Louisiana Association of Business and Industry rated Reynolds 38 percent since he took office but 67 percent for the 2013 session. In 2014, he was rated 100 percent by Louisiana Right to Life, when he voted with a large majority of House members to require abortion providers to have hospital admitting privileges near their clinics. He was scored 70 percent by the Louisiana Family Forum, and 92 percent by the Louisiana Association of Educators. Reynolds ran without opposition for a second term in the House in the nonpartisan blanket primary scheduled for October 24, 2015. In March 2016, Reynolds joined a House bipartisan majority for a one-cent increase in the state sales tax. State representatives voted 76 to 28 for the tax hike, a part of the revenue-raising measures pushed by new Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards. A House and Senate conference committee subsequently trimmed the five years for the duration of the tax to expire instead after twenty-seven months, effective from April 1, 2016 to June 30, 2018. Even the sale of Bibles and religious publications and Girl Scout cookies are now subject to the tax. In June 2017, Reynolds resigned as the House Democratic Leader, He cited his heavy workload as the chief factor in his decision to step down. House Republican Leader Lance Harris of Alexandria expressed regret that Reynolds is leaving the leadership. Reynolds will complete his House term until January 2020 and may seek a third term in the 2019 legislative elections. The next month, however, Reynolds rescinded his resignation as party leader. On June 4, 2018, Reynolds resigned his state House seat to join the Edwards administration as the state parks director. On July 31, 2018, he was succeeded in the House by Democrat-turned-Republican Wayne McMahen, a veterinarian from Springhill, who was the only candidate to file for the position.

He is a member of the Democratic Party. Personal life  Frye was born December 14, 1967 in Starkville, Mississippi during the Vietnam War after the Summer of Love to two college students. At the age of 2, his family moved to Germany where his father, a member of the United States Army, was stationed. In 1984, Frye first moved to Georgia after his father accepted a job to be the head pastor at a Presbyterian church in Griffin, GA. Today, Frye lives in Athens, GA where he has resided since 1989. His wife, Gretchen, is an emergency room nurse at Athens Regional Hospital. The couple has been married since 2000 and has two children, Spencer and Ruby, both of whom attend public school in the district that Frye represents.  Education  After graduating high school from Woodward Academy in 1986, Frye went on to study at the University of Georgia. Frye left the university in 1988 to work in Haiti. He first lived in the island country at the age of 13 and had the opportunity to learn construction skills while building a Baptist church in Pechaud. As a young adult, Frye taught English as a second language at L'Ecole Saint Espris Vocational School. After a year, he returned to the University of Georgia but left again due to financial hardship. Though Frye had every intention of returning to school quickly, he did not re-enroll until almost twenty-five years later. In the fall 2013, he signed up to take the first of his two remaining classes, wanting to set a good example for his children about the importance of attaining an education and finishing what you start. Frye has also said he hopes his experience will encourage others to return to school or attain job skills that will help them build a future. After taking classes for two fall semesters, Frye graduated from the University of Georgia with a Bachelor of Science in Psychology on December 19, 2014. This experience was eye opening to Frye, who said he saw the many barriers students face when trying to finish a degree, such as the expenses of required electronics.  Business  Since 2006, Frye has worked as the Executive Director for Athens Area Habitat for Humanity. He first started at Habitat in 1999 as a construction manager, planning to only work with the non-profit for a year. After seeing the fulfilling work that Habitat does first hand, Frye knew that he wanted to continue helping families purchase their own homes and decided to stay. Today, as Executive Director, he carries out board and Habitat International policy, handles day-to-day operations, oversees all acquisitions, developments and constructions as the licensed contractor, and oversees operations at both Habitat for Humanity Restores in Athens. Through this work, he hopes to make a difference in peoples lives by breaking the cycles of poverty. Frye has also been a small business owner, exported American ambulances to the Middle East, fronted rock bands, and co-founded an environmental company. Political history Frye began his political career in 2010 when he ran in the nonpartisan race for Athens Mayor. Out of the five candidates, Frye received 21% of the vote (5,498) but lost to tax commissioner Nancy Denson who received 34% of the vote (8,929). In 2012, Frye ran to be the Georgia State Representative for the 118th District, which includes Winterville and parts of Athens. In the July Democratic Primary, Frye faced 20 year Incumbent, Keith Heard, who he defeated with 55.33% of the vote, which he attributed to his strong involvement in the community. He then went on to win in a landslide with 70.42% of the vote in the General Election against Republican Casey Kessler. Today, Frye serves on the Budget and Fiscal Oversight Committee as the first Democrat to be appointed to committee leadership since 2004. He also serves as a member on the Game, Fish, and Parks; Ways and Means; Transportation; Health and Human Services; Human Relations and Aging Committees. In 2018, Frye was appointed to the Working Group on Creative Arts and Entertainment and the Special Committee on Access to Quality Health Care. Previously, he also served on the Science and Technology Committee. In 2016, Frye was appointed to the Joint Georgia House and Senate Music Economic Development Study Committee, which worked to encourage and promote the continued growth and success of the music industry in the state. Frye has said he was excited to be appointed because he was interested in tax incentives to benefit smaller music studios, and even the individual musicians, working in Georgia, as well as the larger music enterprises. In 2015, Frye was the only Democrat to serve on the House Study Committee on Short-Term Rental Providers, which worked to determine the best methods to ensure the safety of the public, prevent illegal practices, collect taxes on business activities, and otherwise properly regulate short-term rental providers. Throughout his time in the Georgia General Assembly, Frye has devoted his time to supporting legislation that strengthens all Georgia families, protects waterways, ensures the safety of our children, improves transportation, and promotes more access to housing and healthcare.  Fellowship  In 2011, when Frye first began campaigning for State Representative he recruited a group of university students from the Athens area to be a part of the 2012 campaign staff. He was inspired by their excitement, hard work, and desire to work on legislation, so after being elected he founded the Spencer Frye Fellowship Program. During the first session, it became apparent that the Fellowship was unique and unmatched. No one else in the General Assembly had this pool of young pupils of various undergrad and graduate programs that was able to provide commitment to constituents and detailed analyses of policy. Today, the Fellowship has grown to be a selective year-long program that accepts 25 fellows each fall who are given the opportunity to grow as young professionals, leaders, and active community members.

In 2002 a lengthy correspondence in The Nation followed Hawkes' critical review essay on Stephen J. Gould's final book. In 2012 a special issue of the journal Early Modern Culture was devoted to a discussion of his anti-materialist literary theory.'The New Idealism,' Early Modern Culture 9 (2012) http://emc.eserver.org/1-9/issue9.html In 2013 his 20,000-word article on Recent Studies in the English Renaissance for the journal Studies in English Literature angered critics with remarks on the contemporary economy that many found irrelevant to the topic. Hawkes' work generally explores the connections between economics, literature and philosophy from an anti-capitalist perspective. His later work specifically addresses the cultural and ethical implications of usury and financial derivatives.  Education and academia Hawkes attended Stanwell Comprehensive School near Cardiff, Wales. He took his B.A. at Oxford University, and his M.A., M.Phil. and Ph.D. at Columbia University. At Oxford, Hawkes was a student of the left-wing literary critic Terry Eagleton and at Columbia of Edward Said.

Unlike their counterparts in the United States, who have never been officially recognized by the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, the ORP was officially recognized by the Elks of Canada.  History  The Order of Royal Purple was founded in Vancouver, British Columbia in September 1914.Schmidt, Alvin J. Fraternal Organizations Westport, CT; Greenwood Press p.297 In 2014 the Supreme Executive of the Order of Royal Purple decided to secede from the Elks and start a new organization, the Canadian Royal Purple Society. Some locals, however, wished to remain with the Elks and these were integrated into the organization of the Elks of Canada as Royal Purple Elks Lodges. Approximately 75 of these new Canadian Royal Purple lodges were formed between August 2014 and Feb. 2015.Canadian Elk Feb. 2015 Vol. 64 #2 pp.4-5, 47  Ritual  The Order was quite serious about its ritual. Its fraternal signs were not allowed be used in a lodge until the Bible was open nor after it was closed. The Order had passwords, regalia for formal dress, and a floral emblem. During the initiation rite the candidate was asked to promise \\"never to divulge any of the secrets of the order to anyone.\\" The candidate had also to promise \\"...to defend every worthy member's reputation, never to wrong a member and always help a member in need\\". This obligation followed a prayer by the lodge chaplain and the singing of \\"In Charity's Sweet Name\\".Schmidt p.298 The Canadian Royal Purple has modernised much of its structure and operation and is a Not for Profit Federally Incorporated Organization. Members and Lodges have less restricted guidelines, allowing everyone's ideas to be considered.  Organization  Local units of the Order were called \\"Lodges\\" and the national structure was called the \\"Supreme Lodge\\". In 1979 headquarters were located in Brandon, Manitoba.Schmidt p.298 The last National Office was located at 200 - 2629 - 29th Avenue, Regina, Saskatchewan.National Office  Membership  In 1979 membership was open women who believed in a Supreme Being, were 18 years or old and had male relative in the Elks of Canada. Women who did not have a male relative who was an Elk could also be admitted, but could not make up more than 25% of a lodge. Members were accepted or rejected by a black cube system, with three black cubes being sufficient to reject a candidate for membership.Schmidt p.298 However, membership requirements at the time of the dissolution of the organization were: fourteen years of age, a resident of Canada, supporting democratic and lawful government and the purpose and objectives of the Order.https://web.archive.org/web/20131017180940/http://royalpurpleofcanada.org/about- us.html  See also  *Emblem Club *Daughters of the Improved Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks of the World  References   External links  *Official website as of 2013, the last copy taken by the Wayback Machine Category:Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks Category:Organizations established in 1915 Category:Women's organizations based in Canada Category:Organizations disestablished in 2015 ","title":"Order of Royal Purple"},{"id":"40318270","text":"Juan Carlos Balaguer Zamora (born 6 May 1966) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a goalkeeper.
