The Herodian Dynasty: Origins, Role In Society and Eclipse. Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1998, p.109 died 43 BCE) was the founder of the Herodian Dynasty and father of Herod the Great. According to Josephus, he was the son of Antipas and had formerly held that name. A native of Edom, southeast of Judah between the Dead Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba, which under the Romans came to be known as Idumaea, Antipater became a powerful official under the later Hasmonean kings and subsequently became a client of the Roman general Pompey the Great when Pompey conquered Judah in the name of Roman Republic. When Julius Caesar defeated Pompey, Antipater rescued Caesar in Alexandria, and was made chief minister of Judea, as Judah became known to the Romans, with the right to collect taxes. Antipater eventually made his sons Phasaelus and Herod the governors of Jerusalem and Galilee, respectively. After the assassination of Caesar, Antipater was forced to side with Gaius Cassius Longinus against Mark Antony. The pro-Roman politics of Antipater led to his increasing unpopularity among the devout, non-Hellenised Jews. He died by poison. The diplomacy and artful politics of Antipater, as well as his insinuation into the Hasmonean court, paved the way for the rise of his son Herod the Great, who used this position to marry the Hasmonean princess Mariamne, endear himself to Rome and become king of Judea under Roman influence. Background Though historians understand that Antipater's family converted to Judaism in the second century BCE, different stories had circulated in the wake of his sons coming to power.Peterson, Herod: King of the Jews and Friend of the Romans, p.52-53 They demonstrate the tensions that existed between the Jewish people and the powerful Edomites who appear at this time. Nicolaus of Damascus, the court historian for Herod, wrote that Herod's ancestors were among the historical elite in Jerusalem who had been taken by King Nebuchadnezzar into Babylonian captivity in the sixth century BCE. This account serves two purposes; when the Persian King Cyrus sent the captives in Babylon back to Judea, it is likely that some chose to settle elsewhere. A legitimate dispersion such as this would shroud the fact that Herod's ancestry is undocumented in the meticulous records of returned Jewish families.Ezra 2 Claiming a heritage among the Jews from as early as the Babylonian captivity provides credibility for a pro-Roman and Hellenized Herod as a King over the Jews, for they were highly contemptuous of him.Josephus, Antiquities, 14.15.2. Josephus explains this rendering by critiquing its author: Nicolaus wrote to please Herod and would do so at the cost of truthfulness.Josephus, Antiquities, 16.7.1. Instead Josephus explains that Antipater's family converted to Judaism during the forced conversions by the Sadducee-influenced Hasmonean leader John Hyrcanus (r. 134-104 BCE). Hyrcanus threatened that any Idumeaan who wished to maintain their land would need to be circumcised and enter into the traditions of the Jews.Josephus, Antiquities, 13.9.1. Josephus acknowledges Herod as being \\"by birth a Jew\\" and Antipater as being \\"of the same people\\" with the Jews.Josephus, Antiquities, 16.7.1.Josephus, Antiquities, 14.8.1. Nevertheless, this influential family came to be resented by many Jews for their Edomite ancestry, a fact used by the Hasmoneans and their supporters against them. As such, in a polemic against Herod to discredit him in the eyes of the Romans as unfit to become king of the Jews, Antigonus the Hasmonean is quoted by Josephus as referring to Herod as \\"no more than a private man, and an Idumean, i.e. a half Jew\\". Antipater married Cypros, a Nabataean noblewoman, which helped endear the Nabateans to him.Josephus, Wars, 1.8.9. Their marriage helped bring about a close friendship between him and King Aretas, called by Josephus \\"Aretas the Arabian\\", to whom Cypros was related. The two men had such a relationship that Antipater entrusted his children to his friend when he went to war with the Hasmonean Aristobulus II. They had four sons: Phasael, Herod, Joseph, and Pheroas, and a daughter, Salome, one of several Salomes among the Herodians.Josephus, Antiquities, 14.7.3. Antipater also had a brother named Phalion, who was killed in battle against Aristobulus at Papyron.Josephus, Wars, 1.6.3. Antipater served as a governor of Idumea under King Alexander Jannaeus and Queen Salome Alexandra, the parents of the feuding heirs. Josephus writes that he was a man of great authority among the Idumeans, both wealthy and born into a dignified family.Josephus, Wars, 1.6.2. Indeed, it is clear in the various forms of assistance that Antipater provides to both Hyrcanus II, brother of Aristobulus, and the Romans, that he possessed great resources, and brilliant military and political capabilities.Josephus, Wars, 1.8.7. At the Hasmonean court Antipater laid the foundation for Herod's ascension to the throne of Judea partly through his activities in the court of the Hasmoneans, the heirs of the Maccabees, who were the hereditary leaders of the Jews, and partly by currying favor with the Romans, who were growing more involved and dominant over the region at this time. Soon after Hyrcanus succeeded his widowed mother as ruler and took the office of the high priest, he was immediately attacked by his brother and surrendered. Hyrcanus agreed to retire from public life.Josephus, Antiquities, 14.1.2. Antipater, who seems to have succeeded his father as governor of Idum√¶a, had reason to fear that King Aristobulus would not retain him in this position. Antipater was known as a seditious and trouble-making man, and he exploited the weak- willed Hyrcanus for the sake of his ambition.Josephus, Antiquities, 14.1.3. After Hyrcanus stepped down, Antipater persuaded him to contend against his brother for his rightful position, and even convinced the unsuspecting and reluctant Hyrcanus that his younger brother intended to kill him.Josephus, Antiquities, 14.1.4. He arranged for Hyrcanus to come under the protection of the Arabian King Aretas III in Petra. Together they attacked Aristobulus in Jerusalem, and there was a great upheaval that drew the attention of the Roman magistrate Pompey assigned to the eastern Mediterranean province.Hayes and Mandell, The Jewish People in Classical Antiquity, p.101 Although Pompey and his lieutenant Scaurus initially ruled in Aristobulus‚Äô favor when the brothers brought their case forward, on the third intervention Pompey ordered the brothers to wait. Aristobulus impatiently provoked a political offense that brought Pompey to appoint Hyrcanus the ethnarch of Judea.Hayes and Mandell, The Jewish People in Classical Antiquity, p.107 Hyrcanus proved ineffective as either an administrator, or more importantly, as tax collector. Antipater was able to insinuate himself into a position of influence, and soon exercised the authority that ostensibly belonged to Hyrcanus as high priest.Schiffman, Lawrence H., \\"Judea Under Roman Rule\\", From Text to Tradition, Ktav Publishing House, Hoboken, NJ, 1991 Antipater recognized Rome's growing dominance in the region and exploited it to his advantage. Due to his loyalty to Rome and reliability as a statesman, he was placed in charge of Judea, with responsibilities and privileges that included mediating civil disturbance and tax collecting.Hayes and Mandell, The Jewish People in Classical Antiquity, p.117 Roman procurator and appointments of sons With Hyrcanus established, Antipater thrived and laid the foundation for his family's success by navigating conflicts of loyalty and power-shifting within the Roman elite. When Julius Caesar and Pompey went to battle in Egypt, Pompey was killed, so Antipater in 47 BCE shifted his allegiance to Caesar, and indeed ingratiated himself with Caesar. While Caesar was besieged in Alexandria, Antipater rescued him with three thousand men and the aid of numerous nearby friends. For his \\"demonstrations of valor\\" Caesar elevated Antipater to Roman citizenship, freed him from taxes, and showered him with honors and declarations of friendship.Josephus, Wars, 1.9.3-5. Later when accused by Aristobulus‚Äô son, Antigonus, who returned from Roman bondage to contest for power, Antipater made a great scene of his scars from fighting for Caesar's life in Egypt. He defended himself with a history of unfailing loyalty to the Romans.Josephus, Antiquities, 14.8.4. This appeal persuaded Caesar who then appointed Antipater the first Roman Procurator of Judea.Josephus, Antiquities, 14.8.5. This amity allowed the Jews a special degree of protection and freedom to govern themselves and enjoy Rome's good will.Josephus, Wars, 1.10.3. Josephus notes that with his newfound rights and honors, Antipater immediately began to rebuild the wall of Jerusalem that Pompey had destroyed when subduing Aristobulus.Josephus, Antiquities, 14.4.4. He established order by tempering civil disturbances in Judea and threatening to become a \\"severe master instead of a gentle governor\\" should the people grow seditious and unruly. Matters in Judea were finally calm for a time.Josephus, Antiquities, 14.9.1. At this time came the defining point in Antipater's legacy, whereby he made his sons, Phasael, governor of Jerusalem, and Herod governor of Galilee, to the north of Samaria between the Sea of Galilee and Mediterranean. Herod quickly set about ridding Galilee of what his court historian calls \\"robbers,\\" although they may also have been people resisting Roman rule. His activities eventually resulted in complaints raised with the Sanhedrin. Assassination and legacy After the assassination of Julius Caesar, Antipater was forced to side with Cassius against Mark Antony. When Cassius came to Syria to collect troops, he began to demand harsh tributes, so much so that some entire cities and city curators were sold into slavery.Josephus, Antiquities, 11.1-2. Cassius demanded seven hundred talents out of Judea, so Antipater split the cost between his two sons. One aristocrat tasked with collecting tribute was Malichus I, who disdained Antipater and enraged Cassius by not collecting with haste.Hayes and Mandell, The Jewish People in Classical Antiquity, p.122 However, Antipater saved Malichus from death by expending one hundred talents of his own and placating Cassius‚Äô anger.Josephus, Wars, 1.11.2. Although Antipater saved Malichus' life a second time from a different ruler, Malichus continued to despise Antipater and seek his murder. Josephus presents two opposing reasons, one which would help secure Hyrcanus against the rising threat of Herod,Josephus, Wars, 1.11.2-4. and the other being his desire to quickly dispose of Hyrcanus and take power himself.Josephus, Wars, 1.11.7. He devised multiple assassination attempts which Antipater evaded, but successfully bribed one of Hyrcanus‚Äô cup-bearers to poison and kill Antipater.Josephus, Wars, 1.9.2-4. Antipater's work as power-broker between the Hasmoneans, the Arabians, and the Romans inaugurated dramatic dynamics and steep changes in the history of the Jewish nation. The diplomacy and artful politics of Antipater produced the Herodian dynasty; he paved the way for the rise of his son Herod the Great, who married the Hasmonean princess Mariamne,Josephus, Antiquities, 14.15.14. endeared himself to Rome, and usurped the Judean throne to become king of Judea under Roman influence.

During World War I, he served at the same time as a general in the French Army and as Minister of War for Czechoslovakia. As one of the leading members of the Czechoslovak National Council (the resistance government), he contributed decisively to the cause of Czechoslovakian sovereignty, since the status of Czech- and Slovak-populated territories was one of those in question until shortly before the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, in 1918. His personal motto was \\"To Believe, To Love, To Work\\" (Veri≈•, milova≈•, pracova≈•).  Early life  ≈†tef√°nik was born in Ko≈°arisk√°, Austria-Hungary (now Slovakia), on 21 July 1880. He had 11 brothers and sisters, two of whom died at a young age. His father, Pavol ≈†tef√°nik, was a local Lutheran pastor, and his mother was Albert√≠na Jurenkov√°. He attended schools in Bratislava, Sopron and Szarvas. In 1898, he began studying construction engineering in Prague. In 1900, he transferred his studies to Charles University, where he attended lectures in astronomy, physics, optics, mathematics and philosophy. For the 1902 summer semester, he went to university in Z√ºrich. The Prague years had a great impact on ≈†tef√°nik because he met many important personalities there. The philosophy lectures were given by Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk, the future first president of Czechoslovakia, who inspired ≈†tef√°nik with the idea of co-operation between the Czechs and the Slovaks. Furthermore, ≈†tef√°nik very actively participated in the work of the Slovak student association, Detvan, (and within Detvan, the so-called Hlasists group); he became acquainted with Vavro ≈†rob√°r. His studies were financed largely by Czech associations, including ƒåeskoslovansk√° jednota (Czechoslavic Unity) and Radho≈°≈• since he could not afford them himself. In Prague, he wrote political and artistic texts in which he tried to inform the Czechs of the disastrous situation of the Slovaks at that time. He graduated in 1904 with a doctorate in philosophy and with knowledge of astronomy: his thesis is about a star that was discovered in the Cassiopeia constellation in 1572.  Scientist  In 1904, he went to Paris to find a job in astronomy with a recommendation from a Czech professor who was known in Paris. Initially, he had no money and no command of French, but he was nevertheless able to obtain a job at the famous Paris-Meudon Observatory after its director, Pierre Janssen, one of the cofounders of astrophysics, saw ≈†tef√°nik's talent. ≈†tef√°nik owed to Janssen and Camille Flammarion his social, political and scientific career. The observatory was the most important centre for astronomy at the time so he gained massive prestige from his job. Between 20 June and 4 July 1905, ≈†tef√°nik climbed Mont Blanc (he did so several more times in the following years) to observe the Moon and Mars. Then, he took part in an official French expedition to observe and record a full eclipse of the Sun in Alcossebre, Spain. He thus established his own reputation in French scientific society. He worked with Gaston Millochau, a member of the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise, which made some of its members read his work. His studies and the results of his observations were published in reports to the Acad√©mie, and he received several awards for them. Later, he was invited to an international astronomer conference in Oxford on solar research. Between 1906 and 1908, he was co- director of the Mont Blanc observatories company. In 1907, ≈†tef√°nik received the Prix Jules Janssen, the highest award of the Soci√©t√© astronomique de France, the French astronomical society. At the end of 1907, however, Janssen died and ≈†tef√°nik lost his job. Since 1908, he had been charged by the French authorities with astronomical and meteorological observations, (mainly observations of solar eclipses) and political tasks in various countries all over the world, including (Algeria, Morocco, Turkistan, Russia, India, the United States, Panama, Brazil, Ecuador, Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, Fiji, and Tonga). In Tahiti, he also built an observatory and a network of meteorological stations (rumour has it that much of his time in the Pacific Ocean was spent on spying on German positions). Between the trips, he regularly returned home to Ko≈°arisk√° (the last time in 1913 for his father's funeral). In South America (especially in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador), he had an opportunity to show his diplomatic skills for the first time. ≈†tef√°nik worked in astrophysics and solar physics, and became well known for his spectral analysis of the sun's corona. He was involved in perfecting spectrography and has been considered a predecessor of Bernard Lyot. He also attempted to construct a machine for colour photography and cinematography, and he had his design patented in 1911. Diplomacy In addition to his scientific missions overseas, he also performed diplomatic tasks. He established contacts and friendships with leading scientific, artistic, political, diplomatic and business personalities. He participated in the establishment of business enterprises in France and other countries. His friends included physicist Henri Poincar√©, Aymar de la Baume, Joseph Vallot (the richest man in France), architect Gustave Eiffel, Roland Bonaparte, Prime Minister Camille Chautemps, a French entrepreneur called Devousoud from Chamonix, American astronomer and admiral Simon Newcomb and American diplomat David Jayne Hill. In 1912, he received French citizenship, recognition and access to the French √©lite. On 20 October 1917, he was made a Grand Officier of the Legion of Honour. At the same time, he had some personal problems and a serious stomach illness, which did not get better even after two surgeries. Moreover, World War I had started in Europe.  World War I  Masaryk and ≈†tef√°nik's monument in Ko≈°ice, Slovakia. ≈†tef√°nik believed that defeat of Austria-Hungary and of Imperial Germany would offer an opportunity for the Slovaks and the Czechs to gain independence from Austria-Hungary after the war. Therefore, he joined the French army and trained to become an aviator. He flew MFS-54s for the 10th Army on the Artois and was later transferred to MFS 99 Squadron on the Serbian Front. In May 1915, he flew a total of 30 missions over enemy territory. The Serbian campaign was unsuccessful, but French aviator Louis Paulhan is credited with the world's first \\"medevac\\" by flying the seriously-ill ≈†tef√°nik to safety.L'homme-vent, special issue of L'Ami de P√©zenas, 2010, ISSN 1240-0084. ≈†tef√°nik returned to Paris at the end of 1915, where he became acquainted with Edvard Bene≈° and renewed his association with his former professor, Masaryk. In 1916, the three men founded the Czechoslovak National Council, which led to the government of Czecho-Slovak resistance abroad and to the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918. After 1917, he became vice president of the council. His diplomatic skills made ≈†tef√°nik able to help arrange a meeting of Masaryk and Bene≈° to meet and obtain the support of some of the most important personalities of the Triple Entente. For example, he organized Masaryk's meeting with the French prime minister, Aristide Briand. In 1916, ≈†tef√°nik and the Czecho-Slovak resistance started to organise the Czechoslovak Legions to fight against Austria-Hungary and Germany. For this purpose, ≈†tef√°nik, both as the Czechoslovak Minister of War and as a French general, went to Russia in February 1917 and then to the United States, in the meantime he met Thomas Garrigue Masaryk in London in April.PRECL√çK, Vratislav.

It was largely his personal diplomatic skills and contacts that made the Entente recognise the Czechoslovak National Council as a de facto government and the Czechoslovak Legions as allied forces in the summer and the autumn of 1918. In May 1918, ≈†tef√°nik went to Siberia to try to rally the Czechoslovak legions to a renewal of the Eastern Front, as Bolshevik Russia had withdrawn from the war by signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany and Austria-Hungary in March 1918. The Czechoslovak Legions rebelled against a subsequent Bolshevik order to disarm and so gained the support of the Allies. ≈†tef√°nik then decided that his initial plan was no longer feasible. Independence In January 1919, after the war ended, ≈†tef√°nik went from Russia to France and Italy, where he organized the March retreat of Czechoslovak troops from Siberia to Paris. In addition, his diplomatic skills were needed to solve disagreements between the French and the Italian missions in Czechoslovakia. In April, he went from Paris to Rome to negotiate with the Italian Ministry of War, where he met with his fianc√©e, Juliana Benzoni, for the last time. Then, he went to the main Italian military base in Padua, where he agreed with General Armando Diaz to dissolve the Italian military mission in Czechoslovakia. Sources do not substantiate rumours of disagreements arising between ≈†tef√°nik and Bene≈° or Masaryk, mainly on the position of Slovakia in Czechoslovakia. On the contrary, telegrams sent by ≈†tef√°nik from Vladivostok to the Czechoslovak National Council in Paris on 7 December 1918 indicate that ≈†tef√°nik had a good relationship with them. To Masaryk, he wrote \\"with my filial feelings and a great patriotic happiness, I salute you, venerable professor, as the first president of the Czechoslovak Republic\\". To the President of the Council, Karel Kram√°≈ô, he wrote, \\"Thank you, my dear president, for having chosen me as member of our National Ministry. You and your other co-workers can be sure of my loyalty and my fraternal feelings\\". To Bene≈°, he was even more friendly by using informal pronouns (he used formal pronouns to address Masaryk and Kram√°≈ô): \\"Mr. Bene≈°, Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Prague: \\"I hug you affectionately, my loyal and precious companion during the hours of anxiety\\". (The beginning can be translated instead as \\"I kiss you on the cheek\\".)Mission Militaire Fran√ßaise en Sib√©rie, SHD/GR, 7 N 1622, in La M√©moire Conserv√©e du G√©n√©ral Milan Rastislav ≈†tef√°nik, page 205, by Fr√©d√©ric Guelton, √âmanuelle Braud, and Michal Ksinan, Service Historique de la D√©fense, 2008 The telegrams appear to show that ≈†tef√°nik gave his full support to the union of the Czechs and Slovaks that was led by Masaryk. Masaryk continued to accord ≈†tef√°nik his full confidence to the last days of his life, as demonstrated by the challenging issue that ≈†tef√°nik had to solve while he was Minister of War of the Czechoslovak Republic: disputes with the military missions of France and Italy on Czechoslovak territory, according to his telegram to Masaryk on 21 April 1919, only a few days before ≈†tef√°nik died.Lettre du g√©n√©ral ≈†tef√°nik, ministre de la Guerre, au president de la R√©publique Tch√©coslovaque √† Prague, 21 avril 1919, SHD/GR, 1 K 288(1), in La M√©moire Conserv√©e du G√©n√©ral Milan Rastislav ≈†tef√°nik, page 211, by Fr√©d√©ric Guelton, Emanuelle Braud, and Michal Ksinan, Service Historique de la D√©fense, 2008  Death  ≈†tef√°nik's tomb When ≈†tef√°nik wanted to return home to see his family, he decided to fly from Campoformido, near Udine, Italy, and to use an Italian military plane, a Caproni Ca.3. On 4 May 1919, at around 11:00, his plane tried to land near Bratislava, a military conflict area between the First Republic of Czechoslovakia and the Hungarian Soviet Republic, but crashed near Ivanka pri Dunaji. ≈†tef√°nik died, along with the rest of the crew (two Italian pilots, Colonel Giotto Mancinelli Scotti and Sergeant Umberto Merlino, as well as a mechanic-radiotelegrapher, Gabriel Aggiusto). The reason for the crash is disputed. The official, albeit false, explanation was that the airplane crashed because of bad weather, but it was really sunny with only mild wind. However, the official thorough investigation was not performed for more than seven years. At the time of the crash, Vavro ≈†rob√°r and his entire government had left Bratislava for Skalica, to plant trees as a memorial to the founding of the new Czechoslovak Republic.Marcell Jankovics, \\"H√∫sz esztend≈ë Pozsonyban\\", p. 89 (Hungarian) The Hungarian communists, in the middle of Bratislava's Franz Joseph Bridge, could not have shot down the plane. The Italian plane's identifying colours, a rumour had it, were mistaken for the similar marking of a Hungarian plane so the unannounced, unknown airplane was shot down by the Czechoslovak Army. However, the respected Zr√≠nyi Mikl√≥s National Defense University in Budapest, in a joint article with the Armed Forces Academy of General Milan Rastislav ≈†tef√°nik in Slovakia, published a paper, citing the Italian eyewitness First Lieutenant Martinelli- Scotti: \\"in the course of the first landing attempt, the wheels touched the landing path, after which the cooling water immediately started leaking.

At MIT, researches in the field of artificial intelligence began in late 1950s.  Project MAC  On July 1, 1963, Project MAC (the Project on Mathematics and Computation, later backronymed to Multiple Access Computer, Machine Aided Cognitions, or Man and Computer) was launched with a $2 million grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Project MAC's original director was Robert Fano of MIT's Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE). Fano decided to call MAC a \\"project\\" rather than a \\"laboratory\\" for reasons of internal MIT politics - if MAC had been called a laboratory, then it would have been more difficult to raid other MIT departments for research staff. The program manager responsible for the DARPA grant was J. C. R. Licklider, who had previously been at MIT conducting research in RLE, and would later succeed Fano as director of Project MAC. Project MAC would become famous for groundbreaking research in operating systems, artificial intelligence, and the theory of computation. Its contemporaries included Project Genie at Berkeley, the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and (somewhat later) University of Southern California's (USC's) Information Sciences Institute. An \\"AI Group\\" including Marvin Minsky (the director), John McCarthy (inventor of Lisp) and a talented community of computer programmers was incorporated into the newly formed Project MAC. It was interested principally in the problems of vision, mechanical motion and manipulation, and language, which they view as the keys to more intelligent machines. In the 1960s and 1970s the AI Group shared a computer room with a computer (initially a PDP-6, and later a PDP-10) for which they built a time-sharing operating system called Incompatible Timesharing System (ITS). The early Project MAC community included Fano, Minsky, Licklider, Fernando J. Corbat√≥, and a community of computer programmers and enthusiasts among others who drew their inspiration from former colleague John McCarthy. These founders envisioned the creation of a computer utility whose computational power would be as reliable as an electric utility. To this end, Corbat√≥ brought the first computer time-sharing system, Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS), with him from the MIT Computation Center, using the DARPA funding to purchase an IBM 7094 for research use. One of the early focuses of Project MAC would be the development of a successor to CTSS, Multics, which was to be the first high availability computer system, developed as a part of an industry consortium including General Electric and Bell Laboratories. In 1966, Scientific American featured Project MAC in the September thematic issue devoted to computer science, that was later published in book form. At the time, the system was described as having approximately 100 TTY terminals, mostly on campus but with a few in private homes. Only 30 users could be logged in at the same time. The project enlisted students in various classes to use the terminals simultaneously in problem solving, simulations, and multi-terminal communications as tests for the multi-access computing software being developed.  AI Lab and LCS  In the late 1960s, Minsky's artificial intelligence group was seeking more space, and was unable to get satisfaction from project director Licklider. University space- allocation politics being what it is, Minsky found that although Project MAC as a single entity could not get the additional space he wanted, he could split off to form his own laboratory and then be entitled to more office space. As a result, the MIT AI Lab was formed in 1970, and many of Minsky's AI colleagues left Project MAC to join him in the new laboratory, while most of the remaining members went on to form the Laboratory for Computer Science. Talented programmers such as Richard Stallman, who used TECO to develop EMACS, flourished in the AI Lab during this time. Those researchers who did not join the smaller AI Lab formed the Laboratory for Computer Science and continued their research into operating systems, programming languages, distributed systems, and the theory of computation. Two professors, Hal Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman, chose to remain neutral ‚Äî their group was referred to variously as Switzerland and Project MAC for the next 30 years. Among much else, the AI Lab led to the invention of Lisp machines and their attempted commercialization by two companies in the 1980s: Symbolics and Lisp Machines Inc. This divided the AI Lab into \\"camps\\" which resulted in a hiring away of many of the talented programmers. The incident inspired Richard Stallman's later work on the GNU Project. \\"Nobody had envisioned that the AI lab's hacker group would be wiped out, but it was.\\" ... \\"That is the basis for the free software movement ‚Äî the experience I had, the life that I've lived at the MIT AI lab ‚Äî to be working on human knowledge, and not be standing in the way of anybody's further using and further disseminating human knowledge\\".Transcript of Richard Stallman's Speech , 28 October 2002, at the International Lisp Conference, from gnu.org, accessed September 2012  CSAIL  On the fortieth anniversary of Project MAC's establishment, July 1, 2003, LCS was merged with the AI Lab to form the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, or CSAIL. This merger created the largest laboratory (over 600 personnel) on the MIT campus and was regarded as a reuniting of the diversified elements of Project MAC. In 2018, CSAIL launched a five-year collaboration program with IFlytek, a company sanctioned the following year for allegedly using its technology for surveillance and human rights abuses in Xinjiang. In October 2019, MIT announced that it would review its partnerships with sanctioned firms such as iFlyTek and SenseTime. In April 2020, the agreement with iFlyTek was terminated.  Offices  From 1963 to 2004, Project MAC, LCS, the AI Lab, and CSAIL had their offices at 545 Technology Square, taking over more and more floors of the building over the years. In 2004, CSAIL moved to the new Ray and Maria Stata Center, which was built specifically to house it and other departments.  Outreach activities  The IMARA (from Swahili word for \\"power\\") group sponsors a variety of outreach programs that bridge the global digital divide. Its aim is to find and implement long-term, sustainable solutions which will increase the availability of educational technology and resources to domestic and international communities. These projects are run under the aegis of CSAIL and staffed by MIT volunteers who give training, install and donate computer setups in greater Boston, Massachusetts, Kenya, Native American Indian tribal reservations in the American Southwest such as the Navajo Nation, the Middle East, and Fiji Islands. The CommuniTech project strives to empower under- served communities through sustainable technology and education and does this through the MIT Used Computer Factory (UCF), providing refurbished computers to under-served families, and through the Families Accessing Computer Technology (FACT) classes, it trains those families to become familiar and comfortable with computer technology.Outreach activities at CSAIL - CSAIL homepage, MIT.

Alt URL Now defunct, its formal aim was to promote reintegration of mainland China into the Republic of China. In February 1991, the council drafted the Guidelines for National Unification, which outlined a three-phase approach for Chinese unification. The Guidelines called for Beijing to democratize and become more developed as the precondition for serious talks about steps toward eventual integration. The Council was suspended and ceased to function in early 2006. Establishment The National Unification Council was established under the direct oversight of the Office of the President by President Lee Teng-hui. It first met on 7 October 1990, with 30 members. Membership extended to government officials, political party leaders, industrialists, civic leaders, scholars and journalists. The National Unification Council held 14 meetings from its founding to 8 April 1999. In February 1991, the council drafted the Guidelines for National Unification, which outlined a three-phase approach for Chinese unification. The Guidelines called for Beijing to democratize and become more developed as the precondition for serious talks about steps toward eventual integration. The guidelines stipulate that \\"both the mainland and Taiwan areas are parts of Chinese territory. Helping to bring about national unification should be the common responsibility of all Chinese people.\\" The meaning of \\"one China\\" adopted by the \\"national unification council\\" on 1 August 1992 says that \\"both sides of the Taiwan Straits agree that there is only one China. However, the two sides of the Straits have different opinions as to the meaning of 'one China'.\\" This would later known as the 1992 consensus. Abolition The council had already been out of operation under the administration of Chen Shui-bian since 2000, who has leaned towards Taiwanese independence and opposed Chinese reunification. At the same time, in his \\"Four Noes and One Without\\" policy, Chen promised not to formally abolish the Council or the Guidelines for National Unification, in order to allay international concern about his possible moves toward declaring independence. In his lunar new year speech in 2006 President Chen Shui-bian instructed the Democratic Progressive Party to begin formal debate on the permanent abolition of the National Unification Council and the guidelines set out therein.*BBC News: Alarm at hint to scrap Taiwan body, 2006-02-06 On 27 February 2006, Chen formally announced that the council would \\"cease to function\\" and its guidelines would \\"cease to apply\\".BBC News: Taiwan scraps unification council, 2006-02-27 President Chen Shui-bian declared that the Guidelines for National Unification had \\"ceased to apply\\" because they had been drawn up by an ad hoc presidential commission in the days before citizens had the right to elect their leader and make their voices effectively heard. Moreover, the framers of the guidelines had premised them on a \\"one-China principle\\" and the presumption of eventual unification without consulting the people of Taiwan. The Council was suspended in early 2006, with President Chen Shui-bian remarking: > \\"The National Unification Council will cease to function. No budget will be > ear-marked for it and its personnel must return to their original > posts...The National Unification Guidelines will cease to apply. In > accordance with procedures, this decision will be transmitted to the > Executive Yuan for notice.\\" Chen had previously called for the NUC to be \\"abolished\\" but later toned this down to \\"cease to function\\". The government was ambiguous on whether \\"cease to function\\" was the same as \\"abolish\\". There have been calls for President Ma Ying-jeou to reinstate the National Unification Council, with Taiwan newspaper The China Post remarking in a commentary: President Ma pays homage in person to the Yellow Emperor, China Daily Post > The best and easiest way to show his sincerity is to reinstate the National > Unification Council made to cease to function by President Chen.

Bifurcation theory studies and classifies phenomena characterized by sudden shifts in behavior arising from small changes in circumstances, analysing how the qualitative nature of equation solutions depends on the parameters that appear in the equation. This may lead to sudden and dramatic changes, for example the unpredictable timing and magnitude of a landslide. Catastrophe theory originated with the work of the French mathematician Ren√© Thom in the 1960s, and became very popular due to the efforts of Christopher Zeeman in the 1970s. It considers the special case where the long-run stable equilibrium can be identified as the minimum of a smooth, well-defined potential function (Lyapunov function). Small changes in certain parameters of a nonlinear system can cause equilibria to appear or disappear, or to change from attracting to repelling and vice versa, leading to large and sudden changes of the behaviour of the system. However, examined in a larger parameter space, catastrophe theory reveals that such bifurcation points tend to occur as part of well-defined qualitative geometrical structures.  Elementary catastrophes  Catastrophe theory analyzes degenerate critical points of the potential function ‚Äî points where not just the first derivative, but one or more higher derivatives of the potential function are also zero. These are called the germs of the catastrophe geometries. The degeneracy of these critical points can be unfolded by expanding the potential function as a Taylor series in small perturbations of the parameters. When the degenerate points are not merely accidental, but are structurally stable, the degenerate points exist as organising centres for particular geometric structures of lower degeneracy, with critical features in the parameter space around them. If the potential function depends on two or fewer active variables, and four or fewer active parameters, then there are only seven generic structures for these bifurcation geometries, with corresponding standard forms into which the Taylor series around the catastrophe germs can be transformed by diffeomorphism (a smooth transformation whose inverse is also smooth). These seven fundamental types are now presented, with the names that Thom gave them.  Potential functions of one active variable  Catastrophe theory studies dynamical systems that describe the evolution of a state variable x over time t: \\\\dot{x} = \\\\dfrac{dx}{dt} = -\\\\dfrac{dV(u,x)}{dx} In the above equation, V is referred to as the potential function, and u is often a vector or a scalar which parametrise the potential function. The value of u may change over time, and it can also be referred to as the control variable. In the following examples, parameters like a,b (alternatively written as a,b) are such controls.  Fold catastrophe  Stable and unstable pair of extrema disappear at a fold bifurcation :V = x^3 + ax\\\\, When a<0, the potential V has two extrema - one stable, and one unstable. If the parameter a is slowly increased, the system can follow the stable minimum point. But at the stable and unstable extrema meet, and annihilate. This is the bifurcation point. At there is no longer a stable solution. If a physical system is followed through a fold bifurcation, one therefore finds that as a reaches 0, the stability of the solution is suddenly lost, and the system will make a sudden transition to a new, very different behaviour. This bifurcation value of the parameter a is sometimes called the \\"tipping point\\".  Cusp catastrophe  :V = x^4 + ax^2 + bx \\\\, { style=\\"float:right; clear:right\\"  colspan=2  thumbupright=1.5Diagram of cusp catastrophe, showing curves (brown, red) of x satisfying dV/dx = 0 for parameters (a,b), drawn for parameter b continuously varied, for several values of parameter a. Outside the cusp locus of bifurcations (blue), for each point (a,b) in parameter space there is only one extremising value of x. Inside the cusp, there are two different values of x giving local minima of V(x) for each (a,b), separated by a value of x giving a local maximum. - valign=\\"top\\"  Cusp shape in parameter space (a,b) near the catastrophe point, showing the locus of fold bifurcations separating the region with two stable solutions from the region with one.  Pitchfork bifurcation at on the surface } The cusp geometry is very common, when one explores what happens to a fold bifurcation if a second parameter, b, is added to the control space. Varying the parameters, one finds that there is now a curve (blue) of points in (a,b) space where stability is lost, where the stable solution will suddenly jump to an alternate outcome. But in a cusp geometry the bifurcation curve loops back on itself, giving a second branch where this alternate solution itself loses stability, and will make a jump back to the original solution set. By repeatedly increasing b and then decreasing it, one can therefore observe hysteresis loops, as the system alternately follows one solution, jumps to the other, follows the other back, then jumps back to the first. However, this is only possible in the region of parameter space . As a is increased, the hysteresis loops become smaller and smaller, until above they disappear altogether (the cusp catastrophe), and there is only one stable solution. One can also consider what happens if one holds b constant and varies a. In the symmetrical case , one observes a pitchfork bifurcation as a is reduced, with one stable solution suddenly splitting into two stable solutions and one unstable solution as the physical system passes to through the cusp point (0,0) (an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking). Away from the cusp point, there is no sudden change in a physical solution being followed: when passing through the curve of fold bifurcations, all that happens is an alternate second solution becomes available. A famous suggestion is that the cusp catastrophe can be used to model the behaviour of a stressed dog, which may respond by becoming cowed or becoming angry.E.C. Zeeman, Catastrophe Theory, Scientific American, April 1976; pp. 65‚Äì70, 75‚Äì83 The suggestion is that at moderate stress (), the dog will exhibit a smooth transition of response from cowed to angry, depending on how it is provoked. But higher stress levels correspond to moving to the region (). Then, if the dog starts cowed, it will remain cowed as it is irritated more and more, until it reaches the 'fold' point, when it will suddenly, discontinuously snap through to angry mode. Once in 'angry' mode, it will remain angry, even if the direct irritation parameter is considerably reduced. A simple mechanical system, the \\"Zeeman Catastrophe Machine\\", nicely illustrates a cusp catastrophe. In this device, smooth variations in the position of the end of a spring can cause sudden changes in the rotational position of an attached wheel.Cross, Daniel J., Zeeman's Catastrophe Machine in Flash Catastrophic failure of a complex system with parallel redundancy can be evaluated based on the relationship between local and external stresses. The model of the structural fracture mechanics is similar to the cusp catastrophe behavior. The model predicts reserve ability of a complex system. Other applications include the outer sphere electron transfer frequently encountered in chemical and biological systems and modelling real estate prices. Fold bifurcations and the cusp geometry are by far the most important practical consequences of catastrophe theory. They are patterns which reoccur again and again in physics, engineering and mathematical modelling. They produce the strong gravitational lensing events and provide astronomers with one of the methods used for detecting black holes and the dark matter of the universe, via the phenomenon of gravitational lensing producing multiple images of distant quasars.A.O. Petters, H. Levine and J. Wambsganss, Singularity Theory and Gravitational Lensing\\", Birkh√§user Boston (2001) The remaining simple catastrophe geometries are very specialised in comparison, and presented here only for curiosity value.  Swallowtail catastrophe  Swallowtail catastrophe surface :V = x^5 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx \\\\, The control parameter space is three-dimensional. The bifurcation set in parameter space is made up of three surfaces of fold bifurcations, which meet in two lines of cusp bifurcations, which in turn meet at a single swallowtail bifurcation point. As the parameters go through the surface of fold bifurcations, one minimum and one maximum of the potential function disappear. At the cusp bifurcations, two minima and one maximum are replaced by one minimum; beyond them the fold bifurcations disappear. At the swallowtail point, two minima and two maxima all meet at a single value of x. For values of , beyond the swallowtail, there is either one maximum-minimum pair, or none at all, depending on the values of b and c. Two of the surfaces of fold bifurcations, and the two lines of cusp bifurcations where they meet for , therefore disappear at the swallowtail point, to be replaced with only a single surface of fold bifurcations remaining. Salvador Dal√≠'s last painting, The Swallow's Tail, was based on this catastrophe.  Butterfly catastrophe  :V = x^6 + ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx \\\\, Depending on the parameter values, the potential function may have three, two, or one different local minima, separated by the loci of fold bifurcations. At the butterfly point, the different 3-surfaces of fold bifurcations, the 2-surfaces of cusp bifurcations, and the lines of swallowtail bifurcations all meet up and disappear, leaving a single cusp structure remaining when .

A surface with an elliptical umbilic, and its focal surface. The elliptic umbilic catastrophe is just the upper part of this image. Umbilic catastrophes are examples of corank 2 catastrophes. They can be observed in optics in the focal surfaces created by light reflecting off a surface in three dimensions and are intimately connected with the geometry of nearly spherical surfaces: umbilical point.

Man·π£ur b. Ma·∏•ammƒÅ Bay≈ºƒÅwi\\" in Encyclopedia Iranica He is best known for his saying: \\"I am the Truth\\" (Ana'l-·∏§aqq), which many saw as a claim to divinity, while others interpreted it as an instance of annihilation of the ego which allows God to speak through the individual. Al- Hallaj gained a wide following as a preacher before he became implicated in power struggles of the Abbasid court and was executed after a long period of confinement on religious and political charges. Although most of his Sufi contemporaries disapproved of his actions, Hallaj later became a major figure in the Sufi tradition.  Life = Early years  Al-Hallaj was born around 858 in Fars province of Persia to a cotton-carder (Hallaj means \\"cotton-carder\\" in Arabic) in an Arabized town called al-Bay·∏çƒÅ'. His grandfather was a Zoroastrian. His father moved to a town in Wasit famous for its school of Quran reciters. Al-Hallaj memorized the Qur'an before he was 12 years old and would often retreat from worldly pursuits to join other mystics in study at the school of Sahl al-Tustari. During this period Al-Hallaj lost his ability to speak Persian and later wrote exclusively in Arabic. When he was twenty, al-Hallaj moved to Basra, where he married and received his Sufi habit from 'Amr Makkƒ´, although his lifelong and monogamous marriage later provoked jealousy and opposition from the latter. Through his brother-in-law, al-Hallaj found himself in contact with a clan which supported the Zaydi Zanj rebellion, which had elements of Shi'i school of thought. He retained from this period some apparently Shi'i expressions, but he remained faithful to Sunnism. He later went to Baghdad to consult the famous Sufi teacher Junayd Baghdadi, but he was tired of the conflict that existed between his father-in- law and 'Amr Makkƒ´ and he set out on a pilgrimage to Mecca, against the advice of Junayd Baghdadi, as soon as the Zanj rebellion was crushed.  Pilgrimages and travels  In Mecca he made a vow to remain for one year in the courtyard of the sanctuary in fasting and total silence. When he returned from Mecca, he laid down the Sufi tunic and adopted a \\"lay habit\\" in order to be able to preach more freely. At that time a number of Sunnis, including former Christians who would later become viziers at the Abbasid court, became his disciples, but other Sufis were scandalized, while some Mu øtazilis and Shias who held high posts in the government accused him of deception and incited the mob against him. Al-Hallaj left for eastern Iran and remained there for five years, preaching in the Arab colonies and fortified monasteries that housed volunteer fighters in the jihad, after which he was able to return and install his family in Baghdad. Al-Hallaj made his second pilgrimage to Mecca with four hundred disciples, where some Sufis, his former friends, accused him of sorcery and making a pact with the jinn. Afterwards he set out on a long voyage that took him to India and Turkestan beyond the frontiers of Islamic lands. About 290/902 he returned to Mecca for his final pilgrimage clad in an Indian loin-cloth and a patched garment over his shoulders. There he prayed to God to be made despised and rejected, so that God alone might grant grace to Himself through His servant's lips. Imprisonment and execution After returning to his family in Baghdad, al-Hallaj began making proclamations that aroused popular emotion and caused anxiety among the educated classes. These included avowing his burning love of God and his desire to \\"die accursed for the Community\\", and statements such as \\"O Muslims, save me from God\\" ... \\"God has made my blood lawful to you: kill me\\". It was at that time that al-Hallaj is said to have pronounced his famous shath \\"I am the Truth\\". He was denounced at the court, but a Shafi'i jurist refused to condemn him, stating that spiritual inspiration was beyond his jurisdiction. The Execution of Mansur Hallaj. Watercolor from Mughal India circa 1600.Brooklyn Museum. The Execution of Mansur Hallaj, from the Warren Hastings Album. Al-Hallaj's preaching had by now inspired a movement for moral and political reform in Baghdad. In 296/908 Sunni reformers made an unsuccessful attempt to depose the underage caliph Al- Muqtadir. When he was restored, his Shi'i vizier unleashed anti-Hanbali repressions which prompted al-Hallaj to flee Baghdad, but three years later he was arrested, brought back, and put in prison, where he remained for nine years. The conditions of Al-Hallaj's confinement varied depending on the relative sway his opponents and supporters held at the court, but he was finally condemned to death in 922 on the charge of being a Qarmatian rebel who wished to destroy the Kaaba, because he had said \\"the important thing is to proceed seven times around the Kaaba of one's heart.\\" According to another report, the pretext was his recommendation to build local replicas of the Kaaba for those who are unable to make the pilgrimage to Mecca. The queen- mother interceded with the caliph who initially revoked the execution order, but the intrigues of the vizier finally moved him to approve it. On 23 Dhu 'l-Qa'da (25 March) trumpets announced his execution the next day. The words he spoke during the last night in his cell are collected in Akhbar al-Hallaj. Thousands of people witnessed his execution on the banks of the Tigris River. He was first punched in the face by his executioner, then lashed until unconscious, and then decapitated or hanged. Witnesses reported that Al- Hallaj's last words under torture were \\"all that matters for the ecstatic is that the Unique should reduce him to Unity\\", after which he recited the Quranic verse 42:18. His body was doused in oil and set alight, and his ashes were then scattered into the river. A cenotaph was \\"quickly\\" built on the site of his execution, and \\"drew pilgrims for a millennium\\" until being swept away by a Tigris flood during the 1920s. Some question whether al-Hallaj was executed for religious reasons as has been commonly assumed. According to Carl W. Ernst, the legal notion of blasphemy was not clearly defined in Islamic law and statements of this kind were treated inconsistently by legal authorities. In practice, since apostasy was subsumed under the category of zandaqa, which reflected the Zoroastrian legacy of viewing heresy as a political crime, they were prosecuted only when it was politically convenient. Sadakat Kadri points out that \\"it was far from conventional to punish heresy in the tenth century,\\" and it is thought he would have been spared execution except that the vizier of Caliph Al-Muqtadir wished to discredit \\"certain figures who had associated themselves\\" with al-Hallaj. (Previously al-Hallaj had been punished for talking about being at one with God by being shaved, pilloried and beaten with the flat of a sword, not executed because the Shafi'ite judge had ruled that his words were not \\"proof of disbelief.\\")  Teachings and practices  Al- Hallaj addressed himself to popular audiences encouraging them to find God inside their own souls, which earned him the title of \\"the carder of innermost souls\\" (·∏•allƒÅj al-asrƒÅr). He preached without the traditional Sufi habit and used language familiar to the local Shi'i population. This may have given the impression that he was a Qarmatian missionary rather than a Sufi. His prayer to God to make him lost and despised can be regarded as typical for a Sufi seeking annihilation in God, although Louis Massignon has interpreted it as an expression of a desire to sacrifice himself as atonement on behalf of all Muslims. When al-Hallaj returned to Baghdad from his last pilgrimage to Mecca, he built a model of the Kaaba in his home for private worship. Al-Hallaj was popularly credited with numerous supernatural acts. He was said to have \\"lit four hundred oil lamps in Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre with his finger and extinguished an eternal Zoroastrian flame with the tug of a sleeve.\\" Among other Sufis, Al-Hallaj was an anomaly. Many Sufi masters felt that it was inappropriate to share mysticism with the masses, yet Al-Hallaj openly did so in his writings and through his teachings. This was exacerbated by occasions when he would fall into trances which he attributed to being in the presence of God. Hallaj was also accused of incarnationism (hulul), the basis of which charge seems to be a disputed verse in which the author proclaims mystical union in terms of two spirits in one body. This position was criticized for not affirming union and unity strongly enough; there are two spirits left whereas the Sufi fana' texts speak of utter annihilation and annihilation in annihilation (the annihilation of the consciousness of annihilation), with only one actor, the deity, left.Sells, Michael Anthony. 1996. Early islamic mysticism: Sufi, Qur ºan, miraj, poetic and theological writings. New York: Paulist Press. Saer El-Jaichi has argued \\"that in speaking of the unity with the divine in terms of ·∏•ul≈´l, Hallaj does not mean the fusion (or, mingling) of the divine and human substances.\\" Rather, he has in mind \\"a heightened sense of awareness that culminates in the fulfillment of a spiritual ‚Äì super-sensory ‚Äì vision of God‚Äôs presence.\\"Early Philosophical Sufism: The Neoplatonic Thought of ·∏§usayn Ibn Man·π£≈´r al-·∏§allƒÅƒü. Piscataway, NJ: Gorgias Press. There are conflicting reports about his most famous shath, AnƒÅ l-·∏§aqq \\"I am The Truth, \\" which was taken to mean that he was claiming to be God, since al-·∏§aqq \\"the Truth\\" is one of the Ninety Nine Names of Allah. The earliest report, coming from a hostile account of Basra grammarians, states that he said it in the mosque of Al-Mansur, while testimonies that emerged decades later claimed that it was said in private during consultations with Junayd Baghdadi. Even though this utterance has become inseparably associated with his execution in the popular imagination, owing in part to its inclusion in his biography by Attar of Nishapur, the historical issues surrounding his execution are far more complex. In another controversial statement, al-Hallaj claimed \\"There is nothing wrapped in my turban but God, \\" and similarly he would point to his cloak and say, MƒÅ fƒ´ jubbatƒ´ illƒÅ l-LƒÅh \\"There is nothing in my cloak but God.\\" He also wrote:  Works  Al-Hallaj's principal works, all written in Arabic, included: * Twenty-seven RiwƒÅyƒÅt (stories or narratives) collected by his disciples in about 290/902. * KitƒÅb al-TawƒÅsƒ´n, a series of eleven short works. * Poems collected in Dƒ´wƒÅn al- HallƒÅj. * Pronouncements including those of his last night collected in AkhbƒÅr al-HallƒÅj. His best known written work is the Book of al-Tawasin (), in which he used line diagrams and symbols to help him convey mystical experiences that he could not express in words. ·π¨awƒÅsƒ´n is the broken plural of the word ·π≠ƒÅ-sƒ´n which spells out the letters ·π≠ƒÅ (ÿ∑) and sƒ´n (ÿ≥) placed for unknown reasons at the start of some surahs in the Quran. The chapters vary in length and subject. Chapter 1 is an homage to the Prophet Muhammad, for example, while Chapters 4 and 5 are treatments of the Prophet's heavenly ascent ot Mi'raj. Chapter 6 is the longest of the chapters and is devoted to a dialogue of Satan (Iblis) and God, where Satan refuses to bow to Adam, although God asks him to do so. Satan's monotheistic claim‚Äîthat he refused to bow before any other than God even at the risk of eternal rejection and torment‚Äîis combined with the lyrical language of the love-mad lover from the Majnun tradition, the lover whose loyalty is so total that there is no path for him to any \\"other than\\" the beloved. This passage explores the issues of mystical knowledge (ma'rifa) when it contradicts God's commands for although Iblis was disobeying God's commands, he was following God's will. His refusal is due, others argue, to a misconceived idea of God's uniqueness and because of his refusal to abandon himself to God in love. Hallaj criticizes the staleness of his adoration (Mason, 51-3). Al-Hallaj stated in this book:Kitaab al-Tawaaseen, Massignon Press, Paris, 1913, vi, 32. Classical era views Few figures in Islam provoked as much debate among classical commentators as al-Hallaj. The controversy cut across doctrinal categories. In virtually every major current of juridical and theological thought (Jafari, Maliki, Hanbali, Hanafi, Shafi'i, Ash'ari, and Maturidi) one finds his detractors and others who accepted his legacy completely or justified his statements with some excuse. His admirers among philosophers included Ibn Tufayl, Suhrawardi, and Mulla Sadra. Although the majority of early Sufi teachers condemned him, he was almost unanimously canonized by later generations of Sufis. The principal Sufi interpretation of the shathiyat which took the form of \\"I am\\" sayings contrasted the permanence (baqƒÅ) of God with the mystical annihilation (fanƒÅ) of the individual ego, which made it possible for God to speak through the individual. Some Sufi authors claimed that such utterances were misquotations or attributed them to immaturity, madness or intoxication, while others regarded them as authentic expressions of spiritual states, even profoundest experience of divine realities, which should not be manifested to the unworthy. Some of them, including al-Ghazali, showed ambivalence about their apparently blasphemous nature while admiring the spiritual status of their authors. Rumi wrote: \\"When the pen (of authority) is in the hand of a traitor, unquestionably Mansur is on a gibbet\\"Mathnawi Book 2: line 1398 Translated by Nicholson p.293.

However, he believed that the actions of man, when performed in total accordance with God's pleasure, lead to a blissful unification with Him.Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World, Thompson Gale, (2004), p.290 Malayalam author Vaikom Muhammad Basheer draws parallel between \\"AnƒÅ al-·∏§aqq\\" and Aham Brahmasmi, the Upanishad MahƒÅvƒÅkya which means 'I am Brahman' (the Ultimate Reality in Hinduism). Basheer uses this term to intend God is found within one's 'self'. There was a belief among European historians that al- Hallaj was secretly a Christian, until the French scholar Louis Massignon presented his legacy in the context of Islamic mysticism in his four-volume work La Passion de Husayn ibn Mans√ªr Hall√¢j.

Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. is a city and a suburb in the Fraser Coast Region, Queensland, Australia. As of June 2018 Maryborough had an estimated urban population of 27,282, Estimated resident population, 30 June 2018. having grown slightly at an annual average of 0.12% year-on-year over the preceding five years.  Geography  Maryborough is located on the Mary River in Queensland, Australia, approximately north of the state capital, Brisbane. The city is served by the Bruce Highway. It is closely tied to its neighbour city Hervey Bay which is approximately northeast. Together they form part of the area known as the Fraser Coast. The neighbourhood of Baddow is within the west of the suburb near the Mary River. It takes its name from Baddow House, a historic property in the area (). Baddow railway station () and Baddow Island () in the Mary River also take their names from the house.  History = Original inhabitants, language and culture  Evidence of human inhabitation of the Maryborough region stretches back to at least 6,000 years ago. The Gubbi Gubbi (Kabi Kabi) and Batjala (Butchulla) people were the original inhabitants of the region. The Gubbi Gubbi were described as an inland tribe of the Wide Bay‚ÄìBurnett area, whose lands extended over 3,700 sq. miles and lay west of Maryborough. The northern borders ran as far as Childers and Hervey Bay. On the south, they approached the headwaters of the Mary River and Cooroy. Westwards, they reached as far as the Coast Ranges and Kilkivan. The Batjala occupied the more coastal regions including K‚Äôgari (Fraser Island). The Batjala and Gubbi Gubbi spoke dialects of the Dippil language, the Batjala dialect being spoken in the Fraser Coast region, while the Gubbi Gubbi dialect was spoken in what is now the Gympie and Sunshine Coast regions. The escaped convict James Davis lived among various clans of the Gubbi Gubbi and John Mathew, a clergyman turned anthropologist, also spent five years with them and mastered their language. Dippil language was first described by the Reverend William Ridley on the basis of notes taken from an interview with James Davis in 1855. The Queensland lungfish was native to Gubbi Gubbi waters and the species fell under a taboo among them, forbidding its consumption. It was known in their language as 'dala'. The Batjala considered porpoises to be of a status close to sacred.  The arrival of the British  British navigators Matthew Flinders in 1802 and William Edwardson in 1822 were the first Europeans to take detailed surveys of the Hervey Bay coastline. They both noted that the native population living on its shores appeared numerous. The first British people to live in the region were escaped convicts from the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement. Convicts Richard Parsons and John Graham both briefly lived with local Aboriginals during the late 1820s. James Davis, however, lived with several Gubbi Gubbi clans from 1829 to 1842. He became a member of their society and was given the name Duramboi. In 1842, Andrew Petrie and Henry Stuart Russell sailed up the river known to the Gubbi as the Monoboola (later known as the Mary River) looking for land and timber to exploit. They found Duramboi living with the Ginginbara clan of the Gubbi along its banks at a camp close to where the town of Maryborough is now situated.  Colonisation and conflict  After these initial explorations, pastoral squatters started to enter the region looking to establish sheep stations. The first of these was Mynarton Joliffe who, under the employment of the prosperous squatter John Eales, overlanded 16,000 sheep and set up the Tiaro property in 1843. Aboriginal resistance was fierce, shepherds and livestock were killed, and Joliffe had to abandon the area within eighteen months. During this time, Commissioner of Crown Lands, Stephen Simpson visited the area and determined that the junction of two waterways (later known as the Mary river and Tinana Creek) would be a suitable place for a township. Squatters started to return to the area in 1847 after John Charles Burnett conducted a more thorough survey of the region. Maryborough itself was founded in 1847 by George Furber who established a small wool depot on the banks of the river. A year later Edgar Thomas Aldridge with Henry Palmer and his brother Richard E. Palmer constructed several permanent buildings and in 1849 a post office, petty sessions court and police station overseen by John Carne Bidwill opened. Edmund Blucher Uhr established a boiling down facility in 1850 and John George Walker started a boatyard not long after. The site for the township was laid out by the government surveyor H.H. Labatt in 1850 and the first land sales occurred in January 1852. The name Maryborough was derived from the Mary River which itself was named in 1847 after Mary Lennox, the wife of Charles Augustus Fitzroy who was the Governor of New South Wales at the time. Aboriginal resistance remained determined with numerous Mary River squatters and their shepherds being wounded or killed. Within weeks of his arrival, George Furber was seriously wounded by local Aboriginal people, as were other newly arrived colonists such as Alexander Scott. Furber would later shoot dead the Aboriginal man who tried to kill him outside a store in Maryborough. The body of the man was then taken by the local Aboriginal tribe to a location about half a mile away, where it was cut up, roasted, and eaten. About two or three years later, Furber and his newly arrived son-in-law was killed by two Aboriginal men in 1855. One of the Aboriginal men who murdered Furber was named Minni-Minni, and said that the murder was retribution for Furber killing his mother on suspicion of stealing some flour and other articles from his tent. In November 1850, after receiving intelligence of the murder of a shepherd and the loss of a flock of sheep, the Native Police started to enter the area. Lieutenant Richard Marshall with the assistance of Mary River settlers such as John Murray and Henry Cox Corfield, conducted expeditions to find the stolen sheep. In 1851, the Commandant of the Native Police, Frederick Walker, was called in to apprehend a number of Aboriginal men who had committed criminal acts on the mainland, and were hiding out on Fraser Island. Walker sailed with three sections of troopers down the Mary River. After landing at Fraser Island, the men who were guarding the boats saw a group of Aboriginal men in a stolen boat, which was then later captured. Another stolen boat was observed and shot at, with the Aboriginal crew escaping to a nearby island. While the men camped, the Aboriginal's tried to ambush them, with two of them were killed in the engagements. It was later discovered that the Aboriginal's had partly eaten one of the bodies. Another section captured a number of people while another section followed other inhabitants across to the east coast where they escaped into the ocean. In 1856, a Native Police barracks was constructed on the outskirts of the town at Owanyilla. In early 1860, Lieutenant John O'Connell Bligh and his troopers conducted an early morning raid on a group of Aboriginal people, killing at least two and wounding many others, in the streets of Maryborough. The townspeople gave Bligh a sword thanking him for his actions. By the late 1860s Aboriginal resistance to colonisation in the Maryborough district had been defeated with the survivors existing in poverty as fringe-dwellers. Many of these people were forcibly transferred to an isolation camp on Fraser Island in the 1890s and later shipped to Far North Queensland to the Yarrabah facility.  Sugar  The early Maryborough economy was centred around livestock farming, logging of the bunya pine forests, and the boiling down of animal carcasses to make tallow. In the late 1850s the soil along the Mary River was deemed ideal for the cultivation of sugarcane and in 1859 Edgar Thomas Aldridge was able to grow and produce a world-class experimental crop. Seeing the profitable potential, many influential local landholders such as Henry Palmer and John Eaton formed the Maryborough Sugar Company in 1865. Farmers switched to growing cane and the first Mary River sugar refinery, known as the Central Mill, was built in 1867 by Robert Greathead and Frederick Gladwell. At this time, other sugar plantations in Queensland were importing cheap, sometimes blackbirded labour from islands in the South Pacific. The planters along the Mary River also used this type of labour and the first shipment of 84 South Sea Islander workers arrived in Maryborough in November 1867. They came aboard the schooner Mary Smith, owned by Robert Greathead, with 22 of the labourers being engaged by the Maryborough Sugar Company. Concerns were raised about whether the Islanders on the Mary Smith understood the work contracts and if the pledge to return them would be honoured due to the lack of an interpreter. It was also alleged that the captain sold the Islanders to the colonists for ¬£9 a head, while a missionary noted that the Islanders were unlikely to understand why they were taken. In 1869 Robert Tooth and Robert Cran bought up a number of plantations in the region and established the Yengarie Sugar Refinery. They became the local dominant sugar manufacturer with the Maryborough Sugar Company becoming insolvent. By the end of the 1870s, Robert Cran and his sons had taken control of operations under the name Cran & Co.  Economic and civic expansion  alt= Maryborough was proclaimed a municipality in 1861, and became a city in 1905. During the second half of the 19th-century, the city was a major port of entry for immigrants arriving in Queensland from all parts of the world. St Joseph's Catholic Primary School was established by Mary MacKillop and her Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart in July 1870. It closed in March 1879, as the consequence of a long-running dispute between MacKillop and the Roman Catholic Bishop of Brisbane, James Quinn, over whether the Sisters or the diocese should control the schools. In 1879 Quinn directed MacKillop and her sisters to leave the diocese, despite protests from the laity. In 1880 the Sisters of Mercy arrived in Maryborough and re-opened the school as St Mary's School (now St Mary's Catholic Primary School). The first section of what is now the North Coast Line opened on 6 August 1881, connecting the mining town of Gympie to the river port at Maryborough and followed the Mary River valley. The Queensland Government was under constant pressure to reduce expenditure, and so despite the potential for the line to be part of a future main line, the line was constructed to pioneer standards with minimal earthworks, a sinuous alignment and lightweight rails. Coal had been discovered at Burrum, 25 km north of Maryborough, and a line was constructed to serve the mine, opening in 1883. The line was extended to Bundaberg in 1888 so coal could be shipped there as well. When the Burrum line was built, it junctioned from the Maryborough line at Baddow, 3 km from the station, creating a triangular junction, with platforms ultimately being provided on all three sides. Maryborough railway station was situated immediately adjacent to the commercial centre of the city, and converting it into a through station would have been prohibitively expensive. St Paul's Anglican church opened in 1879, replacing an earlier timber church on the same site. The architect was FDG Stanley. A memorial hall was added in 1921; it was designed by POE Hawkes. St Thomas' Church of England On Friday 7 October 1887 Archbishop William Webber laid the foundation stone of St Thomas' Anglican Church and School in Pallas Street and Theresa Street. On Wed 21 December 1887 St Thomas Anglican Church was officially opened at 197 Pallas Street (). The church was erected by Edgar Thomas Aldridge, of Baddow House in memory of his wife Maria who died on 17 March 1886. Its closure on 29 October 2005 was approved by Assistant Bishop Appleby. alt=When through trains commenced running from Brisbane to Bundaberg and beyond, trains ran into Maryborough, a fresh steam locomotive was attached to the other end of the train, and it then departed. Once diesel locomotives were introduced, there was no need to replace engines, and through trains paused at Baddow on the 3rd leg of the triangular junction before proceeding north. A one carriage connecting service was provided from Maryborough to meet the through train at Baddow, and then return. As trains became longer, the platform on the 3rd leg was not of sufficient length, and the trains would stop on the platform on the line to Maryborough, having to reverse out of, or back into the platform before proceeding further, adding about 15 minutes to the journey. The situation was finally resolved with the opening of the Maryborough West bypass in 1988. Pneumonic plague Ship building along the Mary River Australia's only outbreak of pneumonic plague occurred in Maryborough in 1905. At the time Maryborough was Queensland's largest port‚Äîa reception centre for wool, meat, timber, sugar and other rural products. A freighter from Hong Kong, where plague was rampant, was in the Port of Maryborough about the time that a wharf worker named Richard O'Connell took home some sacking from the wharf, for his children to sleep on. Subsequently, five of the seven O'Connell children, two nurses, and a neighbour died from the disease. There were no more cases but the ensuing fear, panic, and hysteria totally consumed the town, and a huge crowd gathered to witness the family's house being burnt to the ground by health officials. A memorial fountain was built in the grounds of the City Hall and dedicated to the nurses, Cecelia Bauer and Rose Wiles.  Further development  Maryborough War Memorial, circa 1922 The foundation stone of Maryborough War Memorial was laid on 22 May 1921 by Lieutenant Colonel James Durrant. It was dedicated on 19 November 1922. The Andronicus Brothers - Jim and George, formerly from the Greek island of Kythera, established the Caf√© Mimosa in Kent Street, Maryborough in the 1920s. Caf√© Mimosa had a reception lounge above the caf√© large enough to host sporting teams, wedding receptions, musical events and the Philharmonic choir during its practice sessions. The Maryborough Library opened in 1977 and underwent a major refurbishment in 2011. The Maryborough Toy and Special Needs Library opened in 2006. St Aidan's Anglican Church at Baddow closed circa 1983. The city was the location for the 2013 Australian Scout Jamboree.

Maryborough is the self-styled Heritage City of Queensland and holds heritage markets each Thursday. The city has many preserved 19th and 20th century buildings including the General Post Office and Customs House. The main industrial company in the city today is Downer Rail, formerly Walkers Limited, a heavy engineering business which has built much of the rolling stock and locomotives for Queensland Rail and in past years was involved in shipbuilding. Downer Rail, together with Bombardier Transportation, built and tested Transperth's relatively modern B-Series trains in Maryborough, which were launched in Perth in late 2004. It has built many trains for Queensland Rail. Bombardier Transportation closed its factory in Maryborough in December 2015. Maryborough Sugar Factory, in Kent Street was established in 1956. There were many smaller sugar mills which were established by sugar cane farmers along the Mary River. Island Plantation had one of the first sugar crushing mill set up along the river. One of the old settlements in Maryborough is at a place called Dundathu. Here the first timber mill was established in the 1800s. The timber was bought down the river and carted to the Timber Mill by horse and cart. The timber mill burnt down in the 1900s. Maryborough's income also comes from numerous farming and station prospects in and around the city and has a healthy fishing industry. The city also has had traditional ties to the timber industry and is home to Hyne & Son one of the largest producers of natural timber products in Australia. Maryborough was once a prominent centre of railway and tramway operations, including a branch to the wharf on the Mary River. Transport Maryborough West station in July 2012 Maryborough West station is on the North Coast line. It is served by long-distance Traveltrain services: the Spirit of Queensland, Spirit of the Outback and the Bundaberg and Rockhamption Tilt Trains. This station, on the western outskirts of the city, was built in the late 1980s as part of a seven kilometre new alignment built when the North Coast line was electrified. It replaced Maryborough station in the central business district, although the eight kilometre branch remains in use to service the Downer Rail workshops.

Descendants of Zaid ibn Ali are known as Sayyid (for males) and Sayyida (for females), an honorific title bestowed upon to the descendants of Muhammad. The Zaidi surname is derived from Zaid ibn Ali, the son of Imam Ali ibn al-Husayn Zayn al-'Abidin, who was the great grandson of the Prophet Muhammad. Descendants of Zaid ibn Ali who chose to move away from the Arabian Peninsula and have the surname Zaidi are commonly located in Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan,India and Pakistan. The surname Al-Zaidi (Az-Zaidi) can denote one or both of the following: *Sayyid Arab descendants of Zayd bin Ali that either stayed in Kufa, Iraq or returned to Al-Hijaz. *The use of the surname Al-Zaidi to designate association may be with the Zaidiyyah madhhab, whose adherents are found in Yemen. This is akin to the use of the surnames Al-Hanafi, Al-Maliki, Al-Shafi'i, etc.  The Wasitis/Zaidis in South Asia  The Zaidis of the Indian subcontinent use the proper noun \\"Wasiti\\" as a form of self-identification. Zayd ibn Ali is believed to have succumbed to injuries he sustain during a battle in Kufa, Iraq; many of his descendants either returned to al-Hijaz or remained in Iraq. Some of those who stayed in Iraq settled in Wasit. Some descendants from Wasit then moved to the Indian subcontinent. Most of the Zaidis migrated after the Mongol Siege of Baghdad in 1258. Most of them are settled in Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, India and Pakistan.Article by Sayyid 'Ali ibn 'Ali Al-Zaidi, ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿßÿ±ŸäÿÆ ÿßŸÑÿµÿ∫Ÿäÿ± ÿπŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ¥Ÿäÿπÿ© ÿßŸÑŸäŸÖŸÜŸäŸäŸÜ (A short History of the Yemenite Shi‚Äòites, 2005) The largest group among those identifying themselves as Zaidi is Saadat- e-Bara. Saadat means descendant of Muhammad and Bara means twelve in Urdu. There are many interpretations of word bara and many spellings are current: Bara, Bahera, Barha (as spelled in Tuzuk-e-Jahangiri, Akbarnama and other Moghul sources) and Bahira meaning \\"bright\\" in Arabic language. One explanation of the word is as mentioned above; another is that there are twelve villages in Muzaffarnagar District and their residents were called Sadat Barha. These Sayyeds are descendants of Sayyid Abu'l Farah Al Hussaini Al Wasti who came to India from Wasit (Iraq) in the 11th century along with his four sons who settled in four villages of Punjab, Kundliwaal, Chhatbanur, Tihanpur and Jajner giving names to all four clans of Sadat Barha. Their numbers are highest in Karachi (Pakistan) and Muzaffarnagar (India). The Kundliwal clan mainly live in Mujhera, Hashimpur, Valipura, Saifpur, Sikrehra Khola, Tandhera, Khujhera, Khedhi Pachenda and Sarai Rasulpur.

The Ghan is known for travelling through remarkable scenery on its transcontinental journey The service's name is an abbreviated version of its previous nickname, The Afghan Express. The nickname is reputed to have been bestowed in 1923 by one of its crews. Some suggest the train's name honours Afghan camel drivers who arrived in Australia in the late 19th century to help the British colonisers find a way to reach the country's interior. A contrary view is that the name was a veiled insult. In 1891, the railway from Quorn reached remote Oodnadatta where an itinerant population of around 150 cameleers were based, generically called \\"Afghans\\". \\"The Ghan Express\\" name originated with train crews in the 1890s as a taunt to officialdom because, when an expensive sleeping car was put on from Quorn to Oodnadatta, \\"on the first return journey the only passenger was an Afghan\\", mocking its commercial viability.News newspaper, 10 July 1937, p. 4. By as early as 1924, because of the notorious unreliability of this fortnightly steam train, European pastoralists commonly called it \\"in ribald fashion The Afghan Express\\".Register newspaper, 20 October 1924, p. 9. By 1951, when steam engines were replaced by diesel-electric locomotives, this disparaging derivation, like the cameleers, had faded away. Modern marketing has completed the name turnabout.

History Starting in August 1929, The Ghan ran on the Central Australian Railway, originally built as a narrow-gauge railway to Alice Springs under Chief Engineer, Commonwealth Railways, N. G. Bell. In 1957, the standard gauge Stirling North to Marree line opened, and the Ghan was curtailed to operate only north of Marree. In October 1980 the remainder of the line was replaced by a standard-gauge line built to the west of the original line. An extension north from Alice Springs to Darwin opened in January 2004.A distant dream becomes reality The Age 10 January 2004 Original Ghan Construction of what was then known as the Port Augusta to Government Gums Railway began in 1878 when Premier of South Australia William Jervois broke ground at Port Augusta. The line reached Hawker in June 1880, Beltana in July 1881, Marree in January 1884 and Oodnadatta in January 1891. Work on the extension to Alice Springs began in 1926, and was completed in 1929. Until then, the final leg of the train journey was still made by camel. Although there were plans from the beginning to extend the line to Darwin, by the time the extension to Alice Springs had been completed, The Ghan was losing money and the plans for further extension to Darwin were suspended indefinitely. The original Ghan line followed the same track as the overland telegraph, which is believed to be the route taken by John McDouall Stuart during his 1862 crossing of Australia. The Ghan service was notorious for delays caused by washouts of the track. A flatcar immediately behind the locomotive carried spare sleepers and railway tools, so passengers and crew could repair the line. The very uncertain service via this route was tolerated because steam locomotives needed large quantities of water, and Stuart's route to Alice Springs was the only one that had sufficient available water. Initially operated fortnightly, in the 1930s it was increased to weekly. From 1956 until 1975 it operated twice weekly, before reverting to a weekly service.Here & There Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin issue 506 December 1979 page 6 During World War II the service had to be greatly expanded, putting great pressure on the limited water supplies. As a result, de-mineralisation towers, some of which survive to this day, were built along the track so that bore water could be used. When a new line to Alice Springs was built in the 1970s, the use of diesel locomotives meant that there was far less need for water, thus allowing the line to take the much drier route from Tarcoola to Alice Springs. The last narrow gauge service departed Alice Springs on 26 November 1980.Here & There Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin issue 521 March 1981 page 24 New line In October 1980, a new standard gauge line from Tarcoola on the Trans-Australian Railway to Alice Springs opened, and the train took the form it has today. The new line is approximately west of the former line in order to avoid floodplains where the original line was often washed away during heavy rain. It was also hoped that the construction of the new line would improve the train's timekeeping. The first Ghan on the new line departed Adelaide on 11 December 1980.The Window Seat Network September 1980 page 27 It initially operated as a broad gauge service to Port Pirie. Following the conversion of the Adelaide to Crystal Brook to standard gauge in 1982, it operated as a standard gauge train throughout. Operating weekly, a second service was operated between May and October.The New Ghan The Railway Magazine issue 967 November 1981 page 522Intelligence Railway Gazette International June 1982 page 420 In November 1998, one service per week was extended from Adelaide to Melbourne while from April 1999, the other was diverted to operate to Sydney via Broken Hill.\\"GSR Announce Changes to Ghan & Overland\\" Railway Digest August 1998 page 10GSR's Ghan Commences Melbourne Runs Catch Point issue 129 January 1999 page 5\\"Ghan Sydney Bound in April\\" Railway Digest February 1999 page 12First Run of Ghan to Sydney Catch Point issue 131 May 1999 page 5 The extensions were withdrawn in November 2002 and March 2003 respectively.Here & There Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin issue 786 April 2003 page 152Last Ghan into Sydney pulls up short Railway Digest May 2003 page 8 Connection to Darwin Construction of Alice Springs‚ÄìDarwin line was believed to be the second- largest civil engineering project in Australia, and the largest since the creation of the Snowy Mountains Scheme. Line construction began in July 2001, with the first passenger train reaching Darwin on 3 February 2004, after 126 years of planning and waiting and at a cost of $1.3 billion. The Ghan's arrival in Darwin signified a new era of tourism in the Northern Territory, making travel to the region easier and more convenient. The rail link will allow for more freight to travel through the region, leading to a hope that Darwin will serve as another trade link with Asia. In preparation for the connection to Darwin, one of the locomotives was named after Steve Irwin who, until his untimely death three years later, was an international symbol of outback Australia, to promote the new service and tourism to the region.  COVID-19  The Ghan was suspended for five months from March to August 2020 due to ongoing COVID-19 restrictions and border closures ‚Äì the longest suspension in the train's existence. The first post-COVID train departed Adelaide for Darwin on 31 August 2020. Media depictions The original Ghan was featured in an episode of BBC Television's series Great Railway Journeys of the World in 1980, presented by Michael Frayn. The modern Ghan featured in an episode of Channel 5 series Chris Tarrant: Extreme Railways, and the Mighty Trains series. In 2018 it was also the subject of SBS slow television documentary The Ghan: Australia's Greatest Train Journey. The entire journey from Adelaide to Darwin was condensed into a three-hour show with no voiceover, much of it featuring footage directly from the front of the train.

Incidents * On 24 October 2002, The Ghan collided with a school bus in Salisbury, South Australia. Four people on the bus were killed, but there were no significant injuries to the Ghan passengers. *On 12 December 2006, The Ghan collided with a truck at a level crossing and derailed south of Adelaide River in the Northern Territory. Seven of the 11 carriages came off the tracks. One woman was critically injured, other passengers received only minor injuries. The truck driver involved was arrested, according to the NT police, charged and found guilty of a number of charges related to the accident. * On 4 March 2007, rain washed out a portion of the track between Darwin and Adelaide River. During the period of repairs, trains terminated at Katherine. *On 6 August 2007, The Ghan collided with a truck at a level crossing north of Adelaide in South Australia. Three passengers suffered from shock and minor injuries. The truck driver was temporarily trapped in his vehicle. *On 6 June 2009, a nineteen-year-old American tourist clung to the outside of The Ghan for two hours and when he was locked out of the train following a stop in Port Augusta. A technician, Marty Wells, heard his screams and stopped the train.

He was the third surviving son out of four of Clotaire I and Ingund. His reign found him mostly occupied with a successful civil war against his half-brother, Chilperic. When Clotaire I died in 561, his kingdom was divided, in accordance with Frankish custom, among his four sons: Sigebert became king of the northeastern portion, known as Austrasia, with its capital at Rheims, to which he added further territory on the death of his brother, Charibert, in 567 or 568; Charibert himself had received the kingdom centred on Paris; Guntram received the Kingdom of Burgundy with its capital at Orl√©ans; and the youngest son, the aforementioned Chilperic, received Soissons, which became Neustria when he received his share of Charibert's kingdom. Incursions by the Avars, a fierce nomadic tribe related to the Huns, caused Sigebert to move his capital from Rheims to Metz. He repelled their attacks twice, in 562 and c. 568. About 567, he married Brunhilda, daughter of the Visigothic king Athanagild. According to Gregory of Tours: : Now when king Sigebert saw that his brothers were taking wives unworthy of them, and to their disgrace were actually marrying slave women, he sent an embassy into Spain and with many gifts asked for Brunhilda, daughter of king Athanagild. She was a maiden beautiful in her person, lovely to look at, virtuous and well-behaved, with good sense and a pleasant address. Her father did not refuse, but sent her to the king I have named with great treasures. And the king collected his chief men, made ready a feast, and took her as his wife amid great joy and mirth. And though she was a follower of the Arian law she was converted by the preaching of the bishops and the admonition of the king himself, and she confessed the blessed Trinity in unity, and believed and was baptized. And she still remains catholic in Christ's name.Gregory of Tours, The History of the Franks, IV 27 The assassination of Sigebert by Jean Fouquet, from the fifteenth century Grandes Chroniques de France. Upon seeing this, his brother Chilperic sent to Athanagild for his other daughter's hand. This daughter, Galswintha, was given him and he abandoned his other wives. However, he soon tired of her and had her murdered in order to marry his mistress Fredegund. Probably spurred by his wife Brunhilda's anger at her sister's murder, Sigebert sought revenge. The two brothers had already been at war, but their hostility now elevated into a long and bitter war that was continued by the descendants of both. In 573, Sigebert took possession of Poitiers and Touraine, and conquered most of his kingdom. Chilperic then hid in Tournai. But at Sigebert's moment of triumph, when he had just been declared king by Chilperic's subjects at Vitry-en-Artois, he was struck down by two assassins working for Fredegund.Oman, Charles. The Dark Ages, 476-918, Rivingtons, 1908, p. 164 He was succeeded by his son Childebert under the regency of Brunhilda. Brunhilda and Childebert quickly put themselves under the protection of Guntram, who eventually adopted Childebert as his own son and heir. With Brunhilda he had two daughters: Ingund and Chlodosind.

The terms groundwater hydrology, geohydrology, and hydrogeology are often used interchangeably. Groundwater engineering, another name for hydrogeology, is a branch of engineering which is concerned with groundwater movement and design of wells, pumps, and drains.The Ohio State University, College of Engineering (2018). Groundwater Engineering (5240). https://ceg.osu.edu/courses/groundwater-engineering-5240-0 The main concerns in groundwater engineering include groundwater contamination, conservation of supplies, and water quality.Walton, William C. (November 1990). Principles of Groundwater Engineering, p. 1. CRC Press. . Wells are constructed for use in developing nations, as well as for use in developed nations in places which are not connected to a city water system. Wells must be designed and maintained to uphold the integrity of the aquifer, and to prevent contaminants from reaching the groundwater. Controversy arises in the use of groundwater when its usage impacts surface water systems, or when human activity threatens the integrity of the local aquifer system.  Introduction  Hydrogeology is an interdisciplinary subject; it can be difficult to account fully for the chemical, physical, biological and even legal interactions between soil, water, nature and society. The study of the interaction between groundwater movement and geology can be quite complex. Groundwater does not always follow the surface topography; groundwater follows pressure gradients (flow from high pressure to low), often through fractures and conduits in circuitous paths. Taking into account the interplay of the different facets of a multi-component system often requires knowledge in several diverse fields at both the experimental and theoretical levels. The following is a more traditional introduction to the methods and nomenclature of saturated subsurface hydrology.  Hydrogeology in relation to other fields  Painting by Ivan Aivazovsky (1841) Hydrogeology, as stated above, is a branch of the earth sciences dealing with the flow of water through aquifers and other shallow porous media (typically less than 450 m below the land surface). The very shallow flow of water in the subsurface (the upper 3 m) is pertinent to the fields of soil science, agriculture and civil engineering, as well as to hydrogeology. The general flow of fluids (water, hydrocarbons, geothermal fluids, etc.) in deeper formations is also a concern of geologists, geophysicists and petroleum geologists. Groundwater is a slow-moving, viscous fluid (with a Reynolds number less than unity); many of the empirically derived laws of groundwater flow can be alternately derived in fluid mechanics from the special case of Stokes flow (viscosity and pressure terms, but no inertial term). A piezometer is a device used to measure the hydraulic head of groundwater. The mathematical relationships used to describe the flow of water through porous media are Darcy's law, the diffusion and Laplace equations, which have applications in many diverse fields. Steady groundwater flow (Laplace equation) has been simulated using electrical, elastic and heat conduction analogies. Transient groundwater flow is analogous to the diffusion of heat in a solid, therefore some solutions to hydrological problems have been adapted from heat transfer literature. Traditionally, the movement of groundwater has been studied separately from surface water, climatology, and even the chemical and microbiological aspects of hydrogeology (the processes are uncoupled). As the field of hydrogeology matures, the strong interactions between groundwater, surface water, water chemistry, soil moisture and even climate are becoming more clear. California and Washington both require special certification of hydrogeologists to offer professional services to the public. Twenty-nine states require professional licensing for geologists to offer their services to the public, which often includes work within the domains of developing, managing, and/or remediating groundwater resources. For example: aquifer drawdown or overdrafting and the pumping of fossil water may be a contributing factor to sea-level rise.  Definitions and material properties  water drop. One of the main tasks a hydrogeologist typically performs is the prediction of future behavior of an aquifer system, based on analysis of past and present observations. Some hypothetical, but characteristic questions asked would be: *Can the aquifer support another subdivision? *Will the river dry up if the farmer doubles his irrigation? *Did the chemicals from the dry cleaning facility travel through the aquifer to my well and make me sick? *Will the plume of effluent leaving my neighbor's septic system flow to my drinking water well? Most of these questions can be addressed through simulation of the hydrologic system (using numerical models or analytic equations). Accurate simulation of the aquifer system requires knowledge of the aquifer properties and boundary conditions. Therefore, a common task of the hydrogeologist is determining aquifer properties using aquifer tests. In order to further characterize aquifers and aquitards some primary and derived physical properties are introduced below. Aquifers are broadly classified as being either confined or unconfined (water table aquifers), and either saturated or unsaturated; the type of aquifer affects what properties control the flow of water in that medium (e.g., the release of water from storage for confined aquifers is related to the storativity, while it is related to the specific yield for unconfined aquifers).  Aquifer  360px An aquifer is a collection of water underneath the surface, large enough to be useful in a spring or a well. Aquifers can be unconfined, where the top of the aquifer is defined by the water table, or confined, where the aquifer exists underneath a confining bed.North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (2018). Basic Hydrogeology. https://www.ncwater.org/?page=560 There are three aspects that control the nature of aquifers: stratigraphy, lithology, and geological formations and deposits. The stratigraphy relates the age and geometry of the many formations that compose the aquifer. The lithology refers to the physical components of an aquifer, such as the mineral composition and grain size. The structural features are the elements that arise due to deformations after deposition, such as fractures and folds. Understanding these aspects is paramount to understanding of how an aquifer is formed and how professionals can utilize it for groundwater engineering.Birzeit University, Groundwater Engineering. Groundwater potential and Discharge Areas http://www.hwe.org.ps/Education/Birzeit/GroundwaterEngineering/Chapter%204%20-%20Groundwater%20Potential%20and%20Discharge%20Areas.pdf  Hydraulic head  Differences in hydraulic head (h) cause water to move from one place to another; water flows from locations of high h to locations of low h. Hydraulic head is composed of pressure head (œà) and elevation head (z). The head gradient is the change in hydraulic head per length of flowpath, and appears in Darcy's law as being proportional to the discharge. Hydraulic head is a directly measurable property that can take on any value (because of the arbitrary datum involved in the z term); œà can be measured with a pressure transducer (this value can be negative, e.g., suction, but is positive in saturated aquifers), and z can be measured relative to a surveyed datum (typically the top of the well casing). Commonly, in wells tapping unconfined aquifers the water level in a well is used as a proxy for hydraulic head, assuming there is no vertical gradient of pressure. Often only changes in hydraulic head through time are needed, so the constant elevation head term can be left out (Œîh = Œîœà). A record of hydraulic head through time at a well is a hydrograph or, the changes in hydraulic head recorded during the pumping of a well in a test are called drawdown.  Porosity  well sorted [Right] Low porosity, poorly sorted Porosity (n) is a directly measurable aquifer property; it is a fraction between 0 and 1 indicating the amount of pore space between unconsolidated soil particles or within a fractured rock. Typically, the majority of groundwater (and anything dissolved in it) moves through the porosity available to flow (sometimes called effective porosity). Permeability is an expression of the connectedness of the pores. For instance, an unfractured rock unit may have a high porosity (it has many holes between its constituent grains), but a low permeability (none of the pores are connected). An example of this phenomenon is pumice, which, when in its unfractured state, can make a poor aquifer. Porosity does not directly affect the distribution of hydraulic head in an aquifer, but it has a very strong effect on the migration of dissolved contaminants, since it affects groundwater flow velocities through an inversely proportional relationship. Darcy's law is commonly applied to study the movement of water, or other fluids through porous media, and constitutes the basis for many hydrogeological analyses.  Water content  Water content (Œ∏) is also a directly measurable property; it is the fraction of the total rock which is filled with liquid water. This is also a fraction between 0 and 1, but it must also be less than or equal to the total porosity. The water content is very important in vadose zone hydrology, where the hydraulic conductivity is a strongly nonlinear function of water content; this complicates the solution of the unsaturated groundwater flow equation.  Hydraulic conductivity  Hydraulic conductivity (K) and transmissivity (T) are indirect aquifer properties (they cannot be measured directly). T is the K integrated over the vertical thickness (b) of the aquifer (T=Kb when K is constant over the entire thickness). These properties are measures of an aquifer's ability to transmit water. Intrinsic permeability (Œ∫) is a secondary medium property which does not depend on the viscosity and density of the fluid (K and T are specific to water); it is used more in the petroleum industry.  Specific storage and specific yield  Illustration of seasonal fluctuations in the water table. Specific storage (Ss) and its depth- integrated equivalent, storativity (S=Ssb), are indirect aquifer properties (they cannot be measured directly); they indicate the amount of groundwater released from storage due to a unit depressurization of a confined aquifer. They are fractions between 0 and 1. Specific yield (Sy) is also a ratio between 0 and 1 (Sy ‚â§ porosity) and indicates the amount of water released due to drainage from lowering the water table in an unconfined aquifer. The value for specific yield is less than the value for porosity because some water will remain in the medium even after drainage due to intermolecular forces. Often the porosity or effective porosity is used as an upper bound to the specific yield. Typically Sy is orders of magnitude larger than Ss.  Contaminant transport properties  Often we are interested in how the moving groundwater will transport dissolved contaminants around (the sub-field of contaminant hydrogeology). The contaminants can be man-made (e.g., petroleum products, nitrate, Chromium or radionuclides) or naturally occurring (e.g., arsenic, salinity). Besides needing to understand where the groundwater is flowing, based on the other hydrologic properties discussed above, there are additional aquifer properties which affect how dissolved contaminants move with groundwater. 360px = Hydrodynamic dispersion = Hydrodynamic dispersivity (Œ±L, Œ±T) is an empirical factor which quantifies how much contaminants stray away from the path of the groundwater which is carrying it. Some of the contaminants will be \\"behind\\" or \\"ahead\\" the mean groundwater, giving rise to a longitudinal dispersivity (Œ±L), and some will be \\"to the sides of\\" the pure advective groundwater flow, leading to a transverse dispersivity (Œ±T). Dispersion in groundwater arises because each water \\"particle\\", passing beyond a soil particle, must choose where to go, whether left or right or up or down, so that the water \\"particles\\" (and their solute) are gradually spread in all directions around the mean path. This is the \\"microscopic\\" mechanism, on the scale of soil particles. More important, over long distances, can be the macroscopic inhomogeneities of the aquifer, which can have regions of larger or smaller permeability, so that some water can find a preferential path in one direction, some other in a different direction, so that the contaminant can be spread in a completely irregular way, like in a (three-dimensional) delta of a river. Dispersivity is actually a factor which represents our lack of information about the system we are simulating. There are many small details about the aquifer which are effectively averaged when using a macroscopic approach (e.g., tiny beds of gravel and clay in sand aquifers); these manifest themselves as an apparent dispersivity. Because of this, Œ± is often claimed to be dependent on the length scale of the problem ‚Äî the dispersivity found for transport through 1 m3 of aquifer is different from that for transport through 1 cm3 of the same aquifer material.Gelhar, W., Welty, C., Rehfeldt, K., (1992). A Critical Review of Data on Field-Scale Dispersion in Aquifers. Retrieved from http://www.cof.orst.edu/cof/fe/watershd/fe537/labs_2007/gelhar_etal_reviewfieldScaleDispersion_WRR1992.pdf = Molecular diffusion = Diffusion is a fundamental physical phenomenon, which Albert Einstein characterized as Brownian motion, that describes the random thermal movement of molecules and small particles in gases and liquids. It is an important phenomenon for small distances (it is essential for the achievement of thermodynamic equilibria), but, as the time necessary to cover a distance by diffusion is proportional to the square of the distance itself, it is ineffective for spreading a solute over macroscopic distances. The diffusion coefficient, D, is typically quite small, and its effect can often be considered negligible (unless groundwater flow velocities are extremely low, as they are in clay aquitards). It is important not to confuse diffusion with dispersion, as the former is a physical phenomenon and the latter is an empirical factor which is cast into a similar form as diffusion, because we already know how to solve that problem. = Retardation by adsorption = The retardation factor is another very important feature that make the motion of the contaminant to deviate from the average groundwater motion. It is analogous to the retardation factor of chromatography. Unlike diffusion and dispersion, which simply spread the contaminant, the retardation factor changes its global average velocity, so that it can be much slower than that of water. This is due to a chemico-physical effect: the adsorption to the soil, which holds the contaminant back and does not allow it to progress until the quantity corresponding to the chemical adsorption equilibrium has been adsorbed. This effect is particularly important for less soluble contaminants, which thus can move even hundreds or thousands times slower than water. The effect of this phenomenon is that only more soluble species can cover long distances. The retardation factor depends on the chemical nature of both the contaminant and the aquifer. History and Development Henry Darcy, whose work set the foundation of quantitative hydrogeology Henry Darcy: 19th century Henry Darcy was a French scientist who made advances in flow of fluids through porous materials. He conducted experiments which studied the movement of fluids through sand columns. These experiments led to the determination of Darcy's law, which describes fluid flow through a medium with high levels of porosity. Darcy's work is considered to be the beginning of quantitative hydrogeology.Oklahoma State. Henry Darcy and His Law September 3, 2003. https://bae.okstate.edu/faculty-sites/Darcy/1pagebio.htm Oscar Edward Meinzer: 20th century Oscar Edward Meinzer was an American scientist who is often called the \\"father of modern groundwater hydrology\\". He standardized key terms in the field as well as determined principles regarding occurrence, movement, and discharge. He proved that the flow of water obeys Darcy's law. He also proposed the use of geophysical methods and recorders on wells, as well as suggested pumping tests to gather quantitative information on the properties of aquifers. Meinzer also highlighted the importance of studying the geochemistry of water, as well as the impact of high salinity levels in aquifers.\\"Meinzer, Oscar Edward\\" http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX2830902895&v;=2.1&u;=nclivensu‚Å¢=r&p;=GVRL&sw;=w&asid;=88753af7557df17de94c1979354d8c74  Governing equations = Darcy's law  Darcy's law is a constitutive equation, empirically derived by Henry Darcy in 1856, which states that the amount of groundwater discharging through a given portion of aquifer is proportional to the cross-sectional area of flow, the hydraulic gradient, and the hydraulic conductivity.  Groundwater flow equation  Geometry of a partially penetrating well drainage system in an anisotropic layered aquifer The groundwater flow equation, in its most general form, describes the movement of groundwater in a porous medium (aquifers and aquitards). It is known in mathematics as the diffusion equation, and has many analogs in other fields. Many solutions for groundwater flow problems were borrowed or adapted from existing heat transfer solutions. It is often derived from a physical basis using Darcy's law and a conservation of mass for a small control volume. The equation is often used to predict flow to wells, which have radial symmetry, so the flow equation is commonly solved in polar or cylindrical coordinates. The Theis equation is one of the most commonly used and fundamental solutions to the groundwater flow equation; it can be used to predict the transient evolution of head due to the effects of pumping one or a number of pumping wells. The Thiem equation is a solution to the steady state groundwater flow equation (Laplace's Equation) for flow to a well. Unless there are large sources of water nearby (a river or lake), true steady-state is rarely achieved in reality. Both above equations are used in aquifer tests (pump tests). The Hooghoudt equation is a groundwater flow equation applied to subsurface drainage by pipes, tile drains or ditches.The energy balance of groundwater flow applied to subsurface drainage in anisotropic soils by pipes or ditches with entrance resistance.

To use the groundwater flow equation to estimate the distribution of hydraulic heads, or the direction and rate of groundwater flow, this partial differential equation (PDE) must be solved. The most common means of analytically solving the diffusion equation in the hydrogeology literature are: * Laplace, Hankel and Fourier transforms (to reduce the number of dimensions of the PDE), * similarity transform (also called the Boltzmann transform) is commonly how the Theis solution is derived, * separation of variables, which is more useful for non-Cartesian coordinates, and * Green's functions, which is another common method for deriving the Theis solution ‚Äî from the fundamental solution to the diffusion equation in free space. No matter which method we use to solve the groundwater flow equation, we need both initial conditions (heads at time (t) = 0) and boundary conditions (representing either the physical boundaries of the domain, or an approximation of the domain beyond that point). Often the initial conditions are supplied to a transient simulation, by a corresponding steady-state simulation (where the time derivative in the groundwater flow equation is set equal to 0). There are two broad categories of how the (PDE) would be solved; either analytical methods, numerical methods, or something possibly in between. Typically, analytic methods solve the groundwater flow equation under a simplified set of conditions exactly, while numerical methods solve it under more general conditions to an approximation.  Analytic methods  Analytic methods typically use the structure of mathematics to arrive at a simple, elegant solution, but the required derivation for all but the simplest domain geometries can be quite complex (involving non-standard coordinates, conformal mapping, etc.). Analytic solutions typically are also simply an equation that can give a quick answer based on a few basic parameters. The Theis equation is a very simple (yet still very useful) analytic solution to the groundwater flow equation, typically used to analyze the results of an aquifer test or slug test.  Numerical methods  The topic of numerical methods is quite large, obviously being of use to most fields of engineering and science in general. Numerical methods have been around much longer than computers have (In the 1920s Richardson developed some of the finite difference schemes still in use today, but they were calculated by hand, using paper and pencil, by human \\"calculators\\"), but they have become very important through the availability of fast and cheap personal computers. A quick survey of the main numerical methods used in hydrogeology, and some of the most basic principles are shown below and further discussed in the Groundwater model article. There are two broad categories of numerical methods: gridded or discretized methods and non-gridded or mesh-free methods. In the common finite difference method and finite element method (FEM) the domain is completely gridded (\\"cut\\" into a grid or mesh of small elements). The analytic element method (AEM) and the boundary integral equation method (BIEM ‚Äî sometimes also called BEM, or Boundary Element Method) are only discretized at boundaries or along flow elements (line sinks, area sources, etc.), the majority of the domain is mesh- free. = General properties of gridded methods = Gridded Methods like finite difference and finite element methods solve the groundwater flow equation by breaking the problem area (domain) into many small elements (squares, rectangles, triangles, blocks, tetrahedra, etc.) and solving the flow equation for each element (all material properties are assumed constant or possibly linearly variable within an element), then linking together all the elements using conservation of mass across the boundaries between the elements (similar to the divergence theorem). This results in a system which overall approximates the groundwater flow equation, but exactly matches the boundary conditions (the head or flux is specified in the elements which intersect the boundaries). Finite differences are a way of representing continuous differential operators using discrete intervals (Œîx and Œît), and the finite difference methods are based on these (they are derived from a Taylor series). For example, the first-order time derivative is often approximated using the following forward finite difference, where the subscripts indicate a discrete time location, : \\\\frac{\\\\partial h}{\\\\partial t} = h'(t_i) \\\\approx \\\\frac{h_i - h_{i-1}}{\\\\Delta t}. The forward finite difference approximation is unconditionally stable, but leads to an implicit set of equations (that must be solved using matrix methods, e.g. LU or Cholesky decomposition). The similar backwards difference is only conditionally stable, but it is explicit and can be used to \\"march\\" forward in the time direction, solving one grid node at a time (or possibly in parallel, since one node depends only on its immediate neighbors). Rather than the finite difference method, sometimes the Galerkin FEM approximation is used in space (this is different from the type of FEM often used in structural engineering) with finite differences still used in time. = Application of finite difference models = MODFLOW is a well-known example of a general finite difference groundwater flow model. It is developed by the US Geological Survey as a modular and extensible simulation tool for modeling groundwater flow. It is free software developed, documented and distributed by the USGS. Many commercial products have grown up around it, providing graphical user interfaces to its input file based interface, and typically incorporating pre- and post-processing of user data. Many other models have been developed to work with MODFLOW input and output, making linked models which simulate several hydrologic processes possible (flow and transport models, surface water and groundwater models and chemical reaction models), because of the simple, well documented nature of MODFLOW. = Application of finite element models = Finite Element programs are more flexible in design (triangular elements vs. the block elements most finite difference models use) and there are some programs available (SUTRA, a 2D or 3D density-dependent flow model by the USGS; Hydrus, a commercial unsaturated flow model; FEFLOW, a commercial modelling environment for subsurface flow, solute and heat transport processes; OpenGeoSys, a scientific open-source project for thermo-hydro- mechanical-chemical (THMC) processes in porous and fractured media; COMSOL Multiphysics (a commercial general modelling environment), FEATool Multiphysics an easy to use MATLAB simulation toolbox, and Integrated Water Flow Model (IWFM), but they are still not as popular in with practicing hydrogeologists as MODFLOW is. Finite element models are more popular in university and laboratory environments, where specialized models solve non- standard forms of the flow equation (unsaturated flow, density dependent flow, coupled heat and groundwater flow, etc.) = Application of finite volume models = The finite volume method is a method for representing and evaluating partial differential equations as algebraic equations.LeVeque, Randall J., 2002, Finite Volume Methods for Hyperbolic Problems, Cambridge University Press, Aug 26, 2002 Toro, 1999 Similar to the finite difference method, values are calculated at discrete places on a meshed geometry. \\"Finite volume\\" refers to the small volume surrounding each node point on a mesh. In the finite volume method, volume integrals in a partial differential equation that contain a divergence term are converted to surface integrals, using the divergence theorem. These terms are then evaluated as fluxes at the surfaces of each finite volume. Because the flux entering a given volume is identical to that leaving the adjacent volume, these methods are conservative. Another advantage of the finite volume method is that it is easily formulated to allow for unstructured meshes. The method is used in many computational fluid dynamics packages. PORFLOW software package is a comprehensive mathematical model for simulation of Ground Water Flow and Nuclear Waste Management developed by Analytic & Computational Research, Inc., ACRi. The FEHM software package is available free from Los Alamos National Laboratory. This versatile porous flow simulator includes capabilities to model multiphase, thermal, stress, and multicomponent reactive chemistry. Current work using this code includes simulation of methane hydrate formation, CO2 sequestration, oil shale extraction, migration of both nuclear and chemical contaminants, environmental isotope migration in the unsaturated zone, and karst formation. = Other methods = These include mesh-free methods like the Analytic Element Method (AEM) and the Boundary Element Method (BEM), which are closer to analytic solutions, but they do approximate the groundwater flow equation in some way. The BEM and AEM exactly solve the groundwater flow equation (perfect mass balance), while approximating the boundary conditions. These methods are more exact and can be much more elegant solutions (like analytic methods are), but have not seen as widespread use outside academic and research groups yet. Water Wells A water well is a mechanism for bringing groundwater to the surface by drilling or digging and bringing it up to the surface with a pump or by hand using buckets or similar devices. The first historical instance of water wells was in the 52nd century BC in modern-day Austria. Today, wells are used all over the world, from developing nations to suburbs in the United States. There are three main types of wells, shallow, deep, and artesian. Shallow wells tap into unconfined aquifers, and are, generally, shallow, less than 15 meters deep. Shallow wells have a small diameter, usually less than 15 centimeters.\\"Introduction to Ground Water Extraction Technologies: Borehole, Shallow Well, and Tube Well\\" http://www.wateringmalawi.org/Watering_Malawi/Resources_files/Boreholewells.pdf Deep wells access confined aquifers, and are always drilled by machine. All deep wells bring water to the surface using mechanical pumps. In artesian wells, water flows naturally without the use of a pump or some other mechanical device. This is due to the top of the well being located below the water table.Harter, Thomas. ANR Publication 8086. Water Well Design and Construction http://groundwater.ucdavis.edu/files/156563.pdf Water Well Design and Construction A water well in Kerala, India. One of the most important aspects of groundwater engineering and hydrogeology is water well design and construction. Proper well design and construction are important to maintain the health of the groundwater and the people which will use the well. Factors which must be considered in well design are: * A reliable aquifer, providing a continuous water supply * The quality of the accessible groundwater * How to monitor the well * Operating costs of the well * Expected yield of the well * Any prior drilling into the aquiferSutton, Deb. Alberta Agriculture and Forestry (May 2017). Design and Construction of Water Wells https://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/wwg408 There are five main areas to be considered when planning and constructing a new water well, along with the factors above. They are: * Aquifer Suitability * \\"Well Design Considerations * Well Drilling Methods * Well Screen Design and Development * Well Testing\\"Matlock, Dan. 'Fundamentals of Water Well Design, Construction and Testing.' Pacific Groundwater Group. Aquifer suitability starts with determining possible locations for the well using \\"USGS reports, well logs, and cross sections\\" of the aquifer. This information should be used to determine aquifer properties such as depth, thickness, transmissivity, and well yield. In this stage, the quality of the water in the aquifer should also be determined, and screening should occur to check for contaminants. After factors such as depth and well yield are determined, the well design and drilling approach must be established. Drilling method is selected based on \\"soil conditions, well depth, design, and costs.\\" At this stage, cost estimates are prepared, and plans are adjusted to meet budgetary needs. Important parts of a well include the well seals, casings or liners, drive shoes, well screen assemblies, and a sand or gravel pack (optional). Each of these components ensures that the well only draws from one aquifer, and no leakage occurs at any stage of the process. There are several methods of drilling which can be used when constructing a water well. They include: \\"Cable tool, Air rotary, Mud rotary, and Flooded reverse circulation dual rotary\\" drilling techniques. Cable tool drilling is inexpensive and can be used for all types of wells, but the alignment must be constantly checked and it has a slow advance rate. It is not an effective drilling technique for consolidated formations, but does provide a small drilling footprint. Air rotary drilling is cost effective and works well for consolidated formations. It has a fast advance rate, but is not adequate for large diameter wells. Mud rotary drilling is especially cost effective for deep wells. It maintains good alignment, but requires a larger footprint. It has a very fast advance rate. Flooded reverse circulation dual rotary drilling is more expensive, but good for large well designs. It is versatile and maintains alignment. It has a fast advance rate. Well screens ensure that only water makes it to the surface, and sediments remain beneath the Earth's surface. Screens are placed along the shaft of the well to filter out sediment as water is pumped towards the surface. Screen design can be impacted by the nature of the soil, and natural pack designs can be used to maximize efficiency. After construction of the well, testing must be done to assess productivity, efficiency and yield of the well, as well as determine the impacts of the well on the aquifer. Several different tests should be completed on the well in order to test all relevant qualities of the well.  Issues in groundwater engineering and hydrogeology =Contamination Groundwater contamination happens when other fluids seep into the aquifer and mix with existing groundwater. Pesticides, fertilizers, and gasoline are common contaminants of aquifers. Underground storage tanks for chemicals such as gasoline are especially concerning sources of groundwater contamination. As these tanks corrode, they can leak, and their contents can contaminate nearby groundwater. For buildings which are not connected to a wastewater treatment system, septic tanks can be used to dispose of waste at a safe rate. If septic tanks are not built or maintained properly, they can leak bacteria, viruses and other chemicals into the surrounding groundwater. Landfills are another potential source of groundwater contamination. As trash is buried, harmful chemicals can migrate from the garbage and into the surrounding groundwater if the protective base layer is cracked or otherwise damaged. Other chemicals, such as road salts and chemicals used on lawns and farms, can runoff into local reservoirs, and eventually into aquifers. As water goes through the water cycle, contaminants in the atmosphere can contaminate the water. This water can also make its way into groundwater.Groundwater Foundation (2018). Groundwater Contamination http://www.groundwater.org/get-informed/groundwater/contamination.html  Controversy Fracking= Contamination of groundwater due to fracking has long been debated. Since chemicals commonly used in hydraulic fracturing are not tested by government agencies responsible for determining the effects of fracking on groundwater, laboratories at the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, have a hard time determining if chemicals used in fracking are present in nearby aquifers.Vaidyanathan, Gayathri. Scientific American (April 2016). Fracking can contaminate groundwater https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fracking-can-contaminate-drinking- water/ In 2016, the EPA released a report which states that drinking water can be contaminated by fracking. This was a reversal of their previous policies after a $29 million study into the effects of fracking on local drinking water.Scheck, Tom and Tong, Scott. APM Reports (December 2016). EPA reverses course, highlights fracking contamination of drinking water https://www.apmreports.org/story/2016/12/13/epa-fracking-contamination- drinking-water = California = California sees some of the largest controversies in groundwater usage due to the dry conditions California faces, high population, and intensive agriculture. Conflicts generally occur over pumping groundwater and shipping it out of the area, unfair use of water by a commercial company, and contamination of groundwater by development projects. In Siskiyou County in northern California, the California Superior Court ruled poor groundwater regulations have allowed pumping to diminish the flows in the Scott River and disturbed the natural habitat of salmon. In Owens Valley in central California, groundwater was pumped for use in fish farms, which resulted in the death of local meadows and other ecosystems. This resulted in a lawsuit and settlement against the fish companies. Development in southern California is threatening local aquifers, contaminating groundwater through construction and normal human activity. For example, a solar project in San Bernardino County would allegedly threaten the ecosystem of bird and wildlife species because of its use of up to 1.3 million cubic meters of groundwater, which could impact Harper Lake.\\"Groundwater, Rivers, Ecosystems, and Conflicts\\" http://waterinthewest.stanford.edu/groundwater/conflicts/index.html In September 2014, California passed the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, which requires users to manage groundwater appropriately, as it is connected to surface water systems. =Colorado= Due to its arid climate, the state of Colorado gets most of its water from underground. Because of this, there have been issues regarding groundwater engineering practices. As many as 65,000 people were affected when high levels of PFCs were found in the Widefield Aquifer. Groundwater use in Colorado dates back to before the 20th century. Nineteen of Colorado's 63 counties depend mostly on groundwater for supplies and domestic uses. The Colorado Geological Survey has three significant reports on groundwater in the Denver Basin. The first report Geology of Upper Cretaceous, Paleocene and Eocene Strata in the Southwestern Denver Basin, The second report Bedrock Geology, Structure, and Isopach Maps of the Upper Cretaceous to Paleogene Strata between Greeley and Colorado Springs, The third publication Cross Sections of the Freshwater Bearing Strata of the Denver Basin between Greeley and Colorado Springs.\\"Colorado mulls state limit for groundwater contamination from PFCs\\" https://www.denverpost.com/2017/09/17/colorado-state-limit-pfcs-contamination- groundwater/ ‚ÄúGroundwater.‚Äù Colorado Geological Survey, 5 Mar. 2018, coloradogeologicalsurvey.org/water/groundwater/ New Trends in Groundwater Engineering/Hydrogeology Since the first wells were made thousands of years ago, groundwater systems have been changed by human activity. Fifty years ago, the sustainability of these systems on a larger scale began to come into consideration, becoming one of the main focuses of groundwater engineering. New ideas and research are advancing groundwater engineering into the 21st century, while still considering groundwater conservation. Topographical Mapping New advancements have arisen in topographical mapping to improve sustainability. Topographic mapping has been updated to include radar, which can penetrate the ground to help pinpoint areas of concern. In addition, large computations can use gathered data from maps to further the knowledge of groundwater aquifers in recent years. This has made highly complex and individualized water cycle models possible, which has helped to make groundwater sustainability more applicable to specific situations. The Role of Technology Technological improvements have advanced topographical mapping, and have also improved the quality of lithosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and atmosphere simulations. These simulations are useful on their own; however, when used together, they help to give an even more accurate prediction of the future sustainability of an area, and what changes can be made to ensure stability in the area. This would not be possible without the advancement of technology. As technology continues to progress, the simulations will increase in accuracy and allow for more complex studies and projects in groundwater engineering. Growing Populations As populations continue to grow, areas which were using groundwater at a sustainable rate are now beginning to face sustainability issues for the future. Populations of the size currently seen in large cities were not taken into consideration when the long term sustainability of aquifers. These large population sizes are beginning to stress groundwater supply. This has led to the need for new policies in some urban areas. These are known as proactive land-use management, where cities can move proactively to conserve groundwater. In Brazil, overpopulation caused municipally provided water to run low. Due to the shortage of water, people began to drill wells within the range normally served by the municipal water system. This was a solution for people in high socioeconomic standing, but left much of the underprivileged population without access to water. Because of this, a new municipal policy was created which drilled wells to assist those who could not afford to drill wells of their own. Because the city is in charge of drilling the new wells, they can better plan for the future sustainability of the groundwater in the region, by carefully placing the wells and taking growing populations into consideration. Dependency on Groundwater in the United States In the United States, 51% of the drinking water comes from groundwater supplies. Around 99% of the rural population depends on groundwater. In addition, 64% of the total groundwater of the country is used for irrigation, and some of it is used for industrial processes and recharge for lakes and rivers. In 2010, 22 percent of freshwater used in USA came from groundwater and the other 78 percent came from surface water. Groundwater is important for some states that don't have access to fresh water. most of the fresh groundwater 65 percent is used for irrigation and the 21 percent is used for public purposes drinking mostly.Groundwater Foundation (2018).

","title":"Hydrogeology"},{"id":"434332","text":"Galswintha (540‚Äì568) was a queen consort of Neustria. She was the daughter of Athanagild, Visigothic king of Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula, comprising modern Spain and Portugal), and Goiswintha. Galswintha was the sister of Brunhilda, Queen of Austrasia; and the wife of Chilperic I, the Merovingian king of Neustria. Galswintha was likely murdered at the urging of Chilperic's former wife, Fredegund, instigating a 40 year civil war within the Merovingian kingdom. History Merovingian king, Chilperic I (561‚Äì584), ruled over Neustria, which despite being less extensive in total land as that presided over by his brother King Sigebert, was wealthier since the cities of Paris, Tours, and Rouen all fell under its purview. Chilperic sought Galswintha's hand in marriage after his brother, King Sigebert, had married the noblewoman, Brunhilda (Galswintha's sister), a union that violated the Merovingian tradition of seeking the hand of a lowborn woman instead. Galswintha‚Äîdaughter of the Visigothic king, Athanagild‚Äîwas not initially in favor of being betrothed to a northern Frankish king, as the Visigoths considered them barbarians. To the dismay of her mother, Galswintha was ultimately forced to part with her family on her father's (Athanagild) insistence. Her escort to Chilperic's side consisted of nobles and warriors from among both the Goths and Franks. Crossing the Pyrenees, Galswintha's journey took her through Narbonne and Carcassone then onto Poitiers and Tours before reaching Rouen, the location of the marriage arrangement. According to Gregory of Tours, Chilperic was betrothed to multiple women at the time of his marriage to Galswintha and had promised to dismiss all of them if she accepted his proposal. Chilperic honored his avowal by dispensing with his other wives when he married Galswintha. Immediately after their betrothal‚Äîsometime between 566 and 567‚ÄîChilperic gave Galswintha the cities of Limoges, Bordeaux, Cahors, Bearn, and Bigorre as a gift. Chilperic supposedly loved her \\"dearly\\" according to Gregory of Tours, but this was most likely due to her substantial dowry. His former wife Fredegund continued to visit the king's bedchamber, despite Chilperic's proclaimed commitment to Galswintha. She complained bitterly about this betrayal. Still in love with Fredegund, Chilperic allowed himself to be manipulated and had his wealthy wife murdered. Galswintha was apparently strangled. Historian Patrick Geary surmises that Galswintha may also have been murdered as a consequence of Chilperic's fear that she would leave with her dowry. After Galswintha's death, however, the lands‚Äîformerly given by Chilperic‚Äîended up being passed on to her sister Brunhilda. Even though Chilperic retained Galswintha's dowry, her untimely death aroused the enmity of her sister Brunhilda against him and Fredegund; it also incurred the wrath of his brother Sigebert, bringing about 40 years of conflict between the Frankish kingdoms of Austrasia and Neustria‚Äîa veritable Merovingian civil war. When Chilperic was murdered in 584, Brunhilda's anger remained unassuaged, and the conflict following Galswintha's murder continued until Fredegund's death in 597. Beyond this, the result of such antipathy was a three-generation-long feud that essentially \\"wrecked the Merovingian family\\" and contributed to the death of ten of its kings. Galswintha remains listed in modern genealogical charts demonstrating the links between the Visigothic kingdoms and the Byzantine Empire.  Commemoration in Verse  The Late Latin poet Venantius Fortunatus wrote a long commemorative poem (Carmina VI.5) in honour of Galswintha.  In popular culture  Symphonic metal band Leaves' Eyes also wrote a song from their album Symphonies of the Night titled \\"Galswintha\\".

She served as regent during the minority of her son Chlothar II from 584 until 597. Fredegund has traditionally been given a very bad reputation, foremost by the accounts of Gregory of Tours, who depicts her as ruthlessly murderous and sadistically cruel, and she is known for the many cruel stories about her, particularly for her long going feud with queen Brunhilda of Austrasia. Queen Fredegund was born into a low-ranking family but gained power through her association with King Chilperic. Originally a servant of Chilperic's first wife Audovera, Fredegund won Chilperic's affection and persuaded him to put Audovera in a convent and divorce her. Gregory of Tours remarks that Fredegund brought with her a handsome dowry, incurring the immediate affection of King Chilperic. Chilperic put Fredegund aside and married Galswintha. Galswintha died the same year, probably strangled by Fredegund(c. 568), who succeeded Galswintha as queen. Galswintha's sister, Brunhilda, however, began a feud which lasted more than 40 years. Gregory of Tours suggests that the Queen had committed adultery. During a dinner with King Guntram, the recently widowed Fredegund rose to leave the table with the excuse that she is pregnant. The announcement surprised the King, as her son Clothar II was born only four months earlier. Gregory of Tours interprets this exchange as a result of Fredegund's unfaithfulness to her husband. In 580 AD, an epidemic of dysentery broke out in Gaul, afflicting Fredegund's husband King Chilperic and their two sons, Chlodobert and Dagobert. Believing the plague to be a result of her sins, Fredegund burned a number of tax records she feared were unjust and encouraged Chilperic to do the same. Her sons, however, did not survive the epidemic. Following their funerals, Fredegund made a large donation to churches and the poor to continue to atone for her sins. Another of Fredegund's sons, Samson, was stricken with a serious illness while the family was under siege in Tournai. According to Gregory, Fredegund feared that she would catch the disease from Samson and cast him away from her, allowing him to die. The King was offended by her actions as the child had not yet been baptized. When Samson survived longer than expected, Fredegund relented and had him baptized according to the King's wishes.  Conflict with Rigunth  Fredegund and Rigunth, steel engraving from Mme de Witt, Vieilles histoires de la patrie, 1887 Gregory of Tours records the bad relationship between Fredegund and her daughter Rigunth: > She was jealous of her own daughter, Rigunth, who continually declared that > she should be mistressProbably, as the translator O. M. Dalton notes, > because Fredegund began life as a palace maid, while she was of royal blood, > being a king's daughter. in her place. Fredegund waited her opportunity and > under the pretense of magnanimity took her to the treasure-room and showed > her the King's jewels in a large chest. Feigning fatigue, she exclaimed \\"I > am weary; put thou in thy hand, and take out what thou mayest find.\\" The > mother thereupon forced down the lid on her neck and would have killed her > had not the servants finally rushed to her aid. When Rigunth was sent off to her Visigothic fianc√© in Spain Reccared, son of Liuvigild, her entourage was so laden with rich gifts that the Frankish nobles objected that the royal fisc had been depleted. Fredegund asserted that all the gifts had come out of property amassed by her husband's generosity. On the long journey, Rigunth's retainers repeatedly robbed and abandoned her, and by the time she reached Toulouse there was little left.Gregory's report is repeated by Jo Ann McNamara and Suzanne Wemple, \\"The Power of Women through the Family in Medieval Europe: 500-1100\\", Feminist Studies 1.3/4 (Winter - Spring, 1973:126-141), p.130, with the observation \\"it required a strong hand and constant vigilance to retain wealth in those times\\". When Chilperic died in 584 AD, Desiderius of Aquitaine went to Toulouse to secure the remaining treasure. The Neustrian ex-domesticus Leunardus travelled to the Cathedral of Paris, where the Queen was staying, to relay the news of Rigunth's capture. By Gregory's account, Fredegund was so enraged at Leunardus's message that she ordered his public humiliation in the center of the church. She had him beaten, chained, and jailed along with the cooks and bakers who accompanied him on the journey. She stopped short of killing him, however, due to his political status in the region.  Regency  Fredegund, seated on her throne, gives orders to assassinate Sigebert, King of Austrasia, steel engraving after a 15th-century window in the Cathedral of Tournai. Upon the death of Chilperic I in 584, Fredegund became regent during the minority of her infant son Chlothar II.  Major attempts  Fredegund is said to have ordered the assassination of Sigebert I of Austrasia in 575 and also to have made attempts on the lives of Sigebert's son Childebert II, her brother-in-law Guntram, king of Burgundy, and Brunhild. After the mysterious assassination of Chilperic in 584 AD, Fredegund seized the Kings riches and took refuge in the Notre Dame de Paris cathedral. Both she and her surviving son, Clothar II, were protected by Guntram until he died in 592\\\\. Newly widowed, Fredegund attempted to seduce the Neustrian official Eberulf but was ultimately rejected. Gregory of Tours later suspects her of orchestrating Eberulf's assassination.  Persecution of Praetextatus  Additionally, Gregory of Tours suggests that the persecution of the Bishop Praetextatus was largely driven by Fredegund. Following Praetextatus's return from exile, the Queen met him in church and threatened to have him exiled a second time. However, the Bishop was not concerned because he believed he would receive his reward in heaven, whereas Fredegund would be punished in hell. In 586, Fredegund ordered the assassination of Praetextatus and had one of her agents stab him during Easter Mass. The Queen later visited Praetextatus on his deathbed and offered the assistance of her physicians, which Gregory of Tours interprets as an excuse to witness the bishop's death. Praetextatus urged her to repent of her sins before finally succumbing to his wounds. Fredegund later conducted assassination plots against a number of political officials who condemned the assassination, including the Bishop of Bayeux and King Guntram.  Death  Fredegund died of natural causes on 8 December 597 in Paris. The tomb of Fr√©d√©gonde is a mosaic figure of marble and copper, situated in the Saint Denis Basilica, having come from the abbey church of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s. Fredegund did not live to see it, but her son's execution of Brunhilda bore the mark of her conflict with Fredegund. Clothar II, then the king, ordered that she be tied by the arms and hair to the tail of a young, untamed horse, and dragged through the entire army. As soon as the king gave this order, it was carried out. The first time the man who was on the horse dug his spurs in, the horse kicked up his heels with such force that Brunhild's head flew off. Her body was dragged through the bushes and brambles, over hills and dales, so that it was torn to pieces, limb from limb. NotesReferences * Gregory of Tours, History of the Franks, Book IX.

The main branch is located on Grand Avenue in Downtown Los Angeles, near the Walt Disney Concert Hall. MOCA's original space, initially intended as a \\"temporary\\" exhibit space while the main facility was built, is now known as the Geffen Contemporary, in the Little Tokyo district of downtown Los Angeles. Between 2000 and 2019, it operated a satellite facility at the Pacific Design Center facility in West Hollywood.Deborah Vankin (January 16, 2019), MOCA will close its satellite location at the Pacific Design Center Los Angeles Times. The museum's exhibits consist primarily of American and European contemporary art created after 1940. Since the museum's inception, MOCA's programming has been defined by its multi-disciplinary approach to contemporary art.  Founding  In a 1979 political fund raising event at the Beverly Hills Hotel, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, Councilman Joel Wachs, and local philanthropist Marcia Simon Weisman happened to be seated at the same table. Throughout the evening, Weisman passionately discussed the city's need for a contemporary art museum. Weisman's brother, Norton Simon, had stepped in to bail out the financially ailing Pasadena Art Museum in 1975, but was unable to retain its focus on modern art. In the following weeks, the Mayor's Museum Advisory Committee was organized. The committee, led by William A. Norris, set about creating a museum from scratch, including locating funds, trustees, directors, curators, a gallery, and most importantly an art collection. That same year, Weisman and five other key local collectors signed an agreement whereby they would pledge chunks of their private collections, worth up to $6 million, \\"to create a museum of standing and repute.\\"Barbara Isenberg (December 15, 2008), A call for cultural passion Los Angeles Times. The following year, the fledgling Museum of Contemporary Art was operating out of an office on Boyd Street. The city's most prominent philanthropists and collectors had been assembled into a Board of Trustees in 1980, and set a goal of raising $10 million in their first year; an artists advisory council was involved early on. A working staff was brought together; Richard Koshalek was appointed chief curator; relationships were made with artists and galleries; and negotiations were begun to secure artwork and an exhibition space. Following Weisman's initiative, $1-million contributions from Eli Broad, Max Palevsky, and Atlantic Richfield Co. helped securing the construction of the new museum; Broad became MOCA's founding chairman; Palevsky chaired the architectural search committee.Ed Leibowitz (June 1, 2003), Committee of One Los Angeles Magazine. Many of MOCA's initial donors were young and supporting the arts for the first time; a substantial number joined up at the $10,000 \\"founder\\" minimum.  Collection  Making up well over 90% of the museum's works,Patt Morrison (November 21, 2009), MOCA man Los Angeles Times. gifts from several major private collectors form the cornerstones of MOCA's permanent collection of nearly 6,000 works. Much of it has come from board members who donated or bequeathed key works or entire collections, or sold art to the museum at highly favorable terms.Mike Boehm (September 28, 2012), [www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-moca-trustee-peter-brant- using-his-art-to-get-business-loans-20120928,0,649316.story MOCA trustee Peter Brant using his art to get business loans] Los Angeles Times. Within months of its fall 1983 opening, MOCA was able to turn itself into an instant player in the international art world by striking a deal with one of its board members, Giuseppe Panza, who agreed to sell a group of works for $11 million and stagger the payments over five years, interest-free. The 1984 purchase of parts of the Panza Collection encompasses 80 seminal works of abstract expressionism and pop art by Jean Fautrier, Franz Kline, Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg, Mark Rothko, and Antoni T√†pies. In 1985, the museum accepted Michael Heizer's earthwork Double Negative in Nevada desert, donated by Virginia Dwan.William Wilson (December 10, 1985), New Moca Acquisition Is A Hole In The Ground Los Angeles Times. A 1986 bequest by television executive Barry Lowen included 67 works of minimalist, post- minimalist and neo-expressionist painting, sculpture, photography and drawing by artists such as Dan Flavin, Ellsworth Kelly, Agnes Martin, Elizabeth Murray, Julian Schnabel, Joel Shapiro, Frank Stella, and Cy Twombly. In 1989, pieces by the Rita and Taft Schreiber collection were donated to the museum, encompassing 18 paintings, sculptures, and drawings by Jackson Pollock, Piet Mondrian, and Arshile Gorky, among others. Hollywood agent Phil Gersh and his wife Beatrice, both founding members, gave 13 important pieces from their collection to the museum the same year, including Pollock's early drip painting Number 3, 1948 and David Smith's 8-foot-tall stainless steel sculpture Cubi III (1961) ‚Äî as well as works by artists such as Ed Ruscha, Cindy Sherman, and Susan Rothenberg.Dennis McLellan (October 11, 2011), Beatrice Gersh dies at 87; L.A. arts patron Los Angeles Times. Finally, the museum's co-founder Marcia Simon Weisman bequeathed 83 works on paper from artists including Willem de Kooning, Barnett Newman, Jasper Johns and California-based painters Richard Diebenkorn and Sam Francis. In 1991, Hollywood screenwriter Scott Spiegel donated works by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Mark Innerst, Robert Longo, Susan Rothenberg, David Salle, among others. In 2003, the museum received the promise of a gift of 33 pieces from advertising executive Clifford Einstein, chair of MOCA's board of trustees, and his wife, Madeline; the proposed donation included works by Kiki Smith, Nam June Paik, Mark Grotjahn, Sigmar Polke, Mike Kelley, and Lari Pittman.Suzanne Muchnic (June 1, 2007), 33 pieces gifted to MOCA Los Angeles Times. In 2004 the museum received the largest group of artworks donated by a private collector in its 25-year history when E. Blake Byrne, a MOCA trustee and retired television executive, gave 123 paintings, sculptures, drawings, videos and photographs by 78 artists.Suzanne Muchnic (December 17, 2004), Trustee's Donation a Milestone for MOCA Los Angeles Times. Over the years, major donations of art collections have come from the Lannan Foundation and through funding from the Ralph M. Parsons Foundation.Mike Boehm (November 8, 2009), MOCA celebrates 30 years and a rebirth Los Angeles Times. In 2000, MOCA received gifts from artists themselves, including major pieces by sculptor and performance artist Paul McCarthy, video artist Doug Aitken and photographer Andreas Gursky.Suzanne Muchnic (March 12, 2000), Portrait of a Smooth Transition Los Angeles Times. Los Angeles-based artist Ed Moses made a major gift of his work to the museum in 1995, surveying nearly 40 years of his artistic development.Suzanne Muchnic (December 28, 1995), Ed Moses Wraps Up Year With Gift of Major Artworks for MOCA Los Angeles Times. Included within today's permanent collection are works by further influential artists such as Greg Colson, Kim Dingle, Sam Durant, David Hockney, Kenneth Price, John McLaughlin, Robert Motherwell, Raymond Pettibon, James Hayward, and George Segal. As the Los Angeles Times declared, \\"There isn‚Äôt a city in America‚Äînot New York, not Chicago, not Houston, not San Francisco‚Äîwhere a more impressive museum collection of contemporary art can be seen.\\"  Exhibitions  Ever since it opened with an extensive exhibition called The First Show: Painting and Sculpture From Eight Collections, 1940-80, MOCA has been known for thematic-survey exhibitions about postwar art such as A Forest of Signs: Art in the Crisis of Representation (1989), A Minimal Future? Art as Object, 1958-1968 (1994), Reconsidering the Object of Art: 1965-1975 (1995), Hall of Mirrors: Art and Film since 1945 (1996), Out of Actions: Between Performance and the Object, 1949-1979 (1998), WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution (2007), Art in the Streets (2011), Under the Big Black Sun: California Art 1974‚Äì1981 (2011), and Ends of the Earth: Land Art to 1974 (2012). The museum also organized the first major museum retrospectives of the work of Allen Ruppersberg (1985), John Baldessari (1990), Ad Reinhardt (1991), Jeff Wall (1997), Barbara Kruger (1999), and Takashi Murakami (2007). In addition there were also monographic shows like an ambitious installation by Robert Gober in 1997, or a revelatory survey of Sigmar Polke's photographic work in 1995. Since many of those shows traveled to New York and other cities in the U.S., like the show of Robert Rauschenberg combines that opened in Los Angeles in 2006, MOCA became known as \\"one of the greatest feeder museums in the country\\".Roberta Smith (December 7, 2008), Here‚Äôs How to Rescue a Museum at the Brink New York Times. Accessed 1 February 2011. In 2010, the museum canceled a planned retrospective of influential yet under-recognized artist Jack Goldstein to commission artist and director Julian Schnabel to curate a survey of works by actor and artist Dennis Hopper,Christopher Knight (July 11, 2010), Art review: 'Dennis Hopper Double Standard' @ MOCA's Geffen Contemporary Los Angeles Times. and in 2012, actor James Franco curated a tribute exhibition to James Dean, two projects that have been widely criticized for their emphasis on pop and celebrity culture. Of all solo shows on view over the period between January 2008 and December 2012, only about 28% were devoted to female artists.Christopher Knight (July 11, 2013), LACMA, MOCA fall behind in giving female artists a solo platform Los Angeles Times. Besides artists' retrospectives and art historical investigations, under chief curator Paul Schimmel, MOCA has mounted various multiartist theme shows on provocative or challenging topics.

Out of Actions: Between Performance and the Object, 1949-1979, a landmark historical survey presented in 1998, tracked the work of about 150 artists and collectives for whom public performances, in its links to painting, sculpture, dance and theater, and the creative process were far more important than well-crafted objects. Public Offerings, in 2001, explored the phenomenon of youthful creative energy in an overheated art world where stars are created before they leave art school. In ECSTASY: In and About Altered States (2005), some of the artists' works represented altered states of mind that they have experienced under the influence of drugs or hypnosis. WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution, held in 2007, was the first major retrospective of art and the feminist revolution. MOCA hosts the LA Freewaves biennial festival, which exhibits a wide range of new media.  Locations = MOCA Grand Avenue  MOCA Grand Avenue The MOCA Downtown Los Angeles location is home to almost 5,000 artworks created since 1940, including masterpieces by classic contemporary artists, and inspiring new works by emerging and mid- career artists from Southern California and around the world. The MOCA is the only museum in Los Angeles devoted exclusively to contemporary art. In 1986, the celebrated Japanese architect Arata Isozaki, who had never worked on a project in the United States before,Barbara Isenberg (December 22, 1985), Arata Isozaki: Architecture's Global Citizen Los Angeles Times. completed the downtown location's sandstone building to international critical and public acclaim, marking a dramatic achievement in the contemporary art world and heralding a new cultural era in Los Angeles. Its chief exhibition spaces are under the courtyard level, lit from above by groups of pyramidal skylights.Robert Hughes (June 24, 2001), Getting On the Map Time Magazine. The construction and $23 million cost of the MOCA Grand Avenue building was part of a city-brokered deal with the developer of the $1 billion California Plaza redevelopment project on Bunker Hill, Bunker Hill Associates, who received the use of an , publicly owned parcel of land. On the grounds that the law said that 1.5% of the construction costs of new buildings had to be spent on fine- arts embellishments, MOCA's board of trustees had struck a deal with the Community Redevelopment Agency to have the project developer build a 100,000-square-foot museum, designed by an architect of the trustees' choice, at no cost to the museum.Suzanne Muchnic (March 24, 1998), MOCA Director to Resign; Helped Transform Museum Los Angeles Times. In return for the free building, the agency required the trustees to raise $10 million for an operations endowment. Original plans had been for the building to open in time for the 1984 Summer Olympics. However, the project broke ground in 1983 and completed the museum, Omni Hotel and the first of two skyscrapers (One California Plaza) by 1986. The second skyscraper (Two California Plaza) was completed in 1992. Nancy Rubins' monumental stainless-steel sculpture \\"Mark Thompson's Airplane Parts\\" (2001), purchased by MOCA in honor of founding member Beatrice Gersh in 2002, was installed at the museum's plaza. The Grand Avenue location is used to display pieces from MOCA's substantial permanent collection, especially artists who did much of their work between 1940 and 1980. There is also an extensive set of rooms used to display temporary exhibits, usually a major retrospective of an important artist, or works connected by a theme. MOCA downtown buildings and Mark Thompson's Airplane Parts sculpture The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA While the Grand Avenue facility was being planned and under construction, MOCA opened an interim exhibition space called the \\"Temporary Contemporary\\" in the fall of 1983. The new space was located at the edge of a warehouse district in which many Los Angeles artists worked at the time.Joseph Giovannini (November 27, 1983), A New Museum Has An Instant Impact New York Times. On November 17, 1983, the museum inaugurated the building with a Shinto purification ceremony, a ritual often held at groundbreakings in Little Tokyo, as a symbol of mutual recognition between the Japanese community and the museum. The first public program was a commissioned collaboration, \\"Available Light\\" by Lucinda Childs, Frank O. Gehry, and John Adams followed in November 1983 by the inaugural exhibition, \\"The First Show: Painting and Sculpture from 1940-1980\\" curated by Julia Brown. The building had been originally constructed in the 1940s as a hardware store and subsequently used as a city warehouse and police car garage, the \\"TC\\", as it became informally known, is leased from the city for five years for $1 a year. Southern California architect Frank Gehry led the renovation of the Albert C. Martin, Sr.-designed 1947 Union Hardware buildings. Gehry left the exteriors intact, except for new entrance doors, and built a canopy of chain-link fencing and steel trusses over the closed-off street, to form a partially shaded plaza. There are two large, open gallery spaces, illuminated by industrial wire-glass skylights and a row of clerestory windows along the south wall. The intricate structural network of steel beams and supports has been left exposed, serving as support for the many movable display walls and lending a sculptural effect. A steel crane rail, left over from the building's hardware days, remained in place. The loading docks now serve as the lobby. The Temporary Contemporary immediately captivated critics and museum patrons alike with its accessibility, informality and lack of pretension. Writing in The New York Times, John Russell referred to it as \\"a prince among spaces\\", and William Wilson of the Los Angeles Times wrote that it \\"instantly had the hospitable aura of a people's museum.\\" In the view of many, these two appraisals have been borne out in the ensuing years. The New York Times later wrote that \\"[m]ore than any event in recent decades, the Temporary (now known as the Geffen Contemporary) changed the cultural face of Los Angeles\\".Herbert Muschamp (November 26, 2000), When Getting to It Is Part of a Museum's Aesthetic New York Times. Due to the popularity of the Temporary Contemporary and extraordinary suitability of the building for exhibiting contemporary art, the museum's board requested that the City of Los Angeles extend MOCA's lease on the facility for 50 years, until 2038. That request was granted in early 1986, and in 1996 the city extended the lease even further. Also in 1996, MOCA received a $5-million gift from The David Geffen Foundation in support of the museum's endowment drive, and in recognition of this extraordinary gift, the Temporary Contemporary was renamed The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA. In 2019, MOCA received another $5-million gift from Wonmi and Kihong Kwon to transform the Geffen Contemporary with a cross- disciplinary series that will emphasize varied forms of performance but will also include experiential installations, concerts, screenings, readings, conventions and other events. It also will host artist residencies and rehearsals.Deborah Vankin (October 24, 2019), MOCA gets a $5-million gift to transform the Geffen Contemporary for more performance Los Angeles Times. The 55,000-square-foot facility gives enormous latitude to artists and encourages experimentation.Suzanne Muchnic (August 31, 1997), Stop, Look and Look Again Los Angeles Times. It is the largest of the MOCA locations and is ideally suited to large-scale sculptural works and conceptual, multi-media or electronic installations. It is typically used to display more recent works, often by lesser-known artists, and works which require a large amount of space. Some of these works are designed specifically for the Geffen Contemporary's space. In 2018, MOCA unveiled a Barbara Kruger mural, Untitled (Questions), on the Geffen exterior facing Temple Street and sponsored by Wonmi and Kihong Kwon.  MOCA at The Pacific Design Center  MOCA at the Pacific Design Center From 2000 until 2019, MOCA maintained a exhibition space at the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood to present new work by emerging and established artists as well as ancillary programs based upon its major exhibitions and renowned permanent collection. A focus was on design and architecture. The museum exhibited work by Takashi Murakami, Sterling Ruby, Catherine Opie and William Kentridge there, as well as by designers Rick Owens and Rodarte. MOCA also utilized the 384-seat PDC auditorium for a range of public programs.  Programs = Sunday Studio  On the first Sunday of each month from 1pm to 3:30pm, Sunday Studio workshops typically begin with an interactive, discussion-based \\"spotlight\\" tour, highlighting selected works from a current exhibition. Next, participants work collaboratively to create art in response to the work they've seen. Designed and taught by artists, these process-oriented workshops extend the gallery experience and frequently include special activities such as musical performance, movement, and other multidisciplinary approaches to works on view. The program is offered in English and Spanish. Big Family Day is an annual spring culminating event for all of MOCA's school and community partnership programs. Featuring student docents, entertainment, music, artmaking and a student art exhibition, this event usually attracts over 1,000 participants, including MOCA members, their families, and the community at large. Sunday Studio events are held at Grand Avenue unless otherwise stated in the bimonthly calendar or on the website.  Teens of Contemporary Art (TOCA)  Teens of Contemporary Art is an open gathering of high school students interested in learning more about contemporary art with their peers. The group meets each month for exhibition explorations, art workshops, discussions about contemporary art, and events planning. An advisory council of teens identifies the topics and issues addressed at the monthly sessions. All TOCA participants get free admission to the museum. TOCA events are the second Sunday of every month.  MOCA Apprenticeship Program (MAP)  Each year the MOCA Apprenticeship Program (MAP) creates a supportive artistic community for a small, diverse group of high school students. During this nine-month internship program, apprentices meet weekly with MOCA staff and guest artists, undertake individual and self- directed projects throughout the museum and discover more about contemporary art, MOCA, and their own professional future. Apprentices are considered staff and are paid an hourly wage. MAP participation is available by application only. Applications are available and due in the spring of each year.  Engagement Party  Engagement Party (2008-2012) was a free public program that presented new work by emerging Southern California‚Äìbased artists working collectively and collaboratively. The program offered artist collectives three-month residencies during which they presented public programs at MOCA Grand Avenue and the Geffen Contemporary at MOCA on the first Thursday of each month from 7 to 10pm. Collectives employed many different mediums, disciplines, and strategies during their residency, resulting in programs that included performances, workshops, screenings, lectures, and many other activities emerging from the group's particular focus. Participating Artists: Finishing School, Knifeandfork (Brian House and Sue Huang), OJO, Slanguage, My Barbarian, Lucky Dragons, Ryan Heffington + the East Siders, and The League of Imaginary Scientists, Neighborhood Public Radio, The Los Angeles Urban Rangers, Liz Glynn, and CamLab.  Women in the Arts  The Women in the Arts event, established in 1994 by the MOCA fundraising arm the MOCA Projects Council, is a benefit for MOCA's educational programs and generally draws more than 600 people from the fields of art, fashion, philanthropy, film and other areas of entertainment. The Award to Distinguished Women in the Arts recognizes women providing leadership and innovation in visual arts, dance, music and literature.Deborah Vankin (September 19, 2013), Sharon Stone will host MOCA's Distinguished Women in the Arts event Los Angeles Times.

Management=Director In July 2018, MoMA PS1 curator Klaus Biesenbach was named as the new director of MOCA, following the abrupt resignation of Philippe Vergne. Vergne, formerly the director of the Dia Art Foundation in New York, began his tenure as MOCA's director in January 2014, and ended it amid a series of controversies, including the firing of chief curator Helen Molesworth. Before Vergne, Maria Seferian served as interim director from September 2013 to March 2014, while the institution underwent the search for its next director. She has been counsel to the museum since 2008. The New York art dealer and curator Jeffrey Deitch served as director of MOCA from June 1, 2010 through September 1, 2013. On July 24, 2013 he told the board of his decision to leave. Deitch experienced a measure of controversy for his clash with Paul Schimmel, the museum's then-chief curator. The board's firing of Schimmel on June 28, 2012 was met with criticism from the community. Between 1999 and 2008, Jeremy Strick led the institution. Before that, Richard Koshalek served as director, deputy director and chief curator from 1980 to 1999.Richard Koshalek Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C. Pontus Hult√©n was founding director between 1980 and 1982. Board of Trustees As of August 2016, MOCA's board is headed by Guess jeans co-founder Maurice Marciano and Lilly Tartikoff Karatz. Vice chairs are Eugenio Lopez, Lillian P. Lovelace and Maria Seferian; chair emeriti are Clifford J. Einstein and David G. Johnson; president emeriti are Dallas Price-Van Breda and Jeffrey Soros.

Funding Unlike the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which is partly controlled by the county, MOCA receives minimal government funding and does not have a steady source of funds. Its annual budget has grown to exceed $20 million, but it relies on donors to pay about 80% of its expenses.Mike Boehm (November 19, 2008), Moca In Deep Financial Trouble Los Angeles Times. MOCA's budget for the fiscal year 2011 was $14.3 million,Roberta Smith (July 22, 2012), A Los Angeles Museum on Life-Support New York Times. the museum's lowest spending since the 1990s.Mike Boehm (December 4, 2012), USC and MOCA are in talks about 'a possible partnership' Los Angeles Times. In 2011, the museum reported net assets (basically, a total of all the resources it has on its books, except the value of the art) of $38 million.

Amid speculation that the museum may close its doors, deaccession artworks, and/or merge with another institution, a grassroots, artist-led organization called MOCA Mobilization petitioned for MOCA to remain independent and keep its collection intact. The Attorney General's office, to whom Eli Broad had been a campaign contributor, investigated MOCA. Ultimately, although the investigation was closed with no disciplinary action (Board members were asked to take a voluntary training in their fiduciary duties), just the report of the investigation in the Los Angeles Times had an enormous impact - donors fled and the trustees, in the maelstrom, accepted Broad's terms for control of the institution in exchange for his promise to donate money. Broad, MOCA's founding chairman from 1979 to 1984 and life trustee of the museum, offered $30 million in a staggered donation, $15 million as matching donations. An agreement with Broad was tentatively reached on December 18, but another possibility‚Äîa merger with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art‚Äîhad not been ruled out. On December 23, the museum announced that it had accepted Broad's offer and would be making a number of significant changes to its leadership. Director Jeremy Strick resigned, and a new position of chief executive officer was created for Charles E. Young, former chancellor of the University of California, Los Angeles. Broad required compliance with strict financial terms, but did not demand Strick's resignation or Young's appointment as a condition. Hired for a limited term, Young oversaw layoffs and cutbacks in the exhibition schedule that reduced MOCA's budget from more than $24 million to less than the $16 million in 2011. In a departure from past practice, when MOCA would schedule shows before funding had been secured, it has adopted a policy of committing to exhibitions only after at least 80% of its projected budget has been lined up.Mike Boehm (July 7, 2012), MOCA: Eli Broad discusses ousting of Paul Schimmel Los Angeles Times. The departure of respected curator Paul Schimmel on June 28, 2012 led to an exodus of trustees, committee members and a bombardment of criticism in the community. And because Broad himself has defaulted on his promised payments to MOCA that expire in 2013 the viability of the institution has come into question under Broad's leadership. As of late 2012, the Museum of Contemporary Art and the private University of Southern California are in talks about a possible partnership. In a first for MOCA, a two-day Sotheby's auction of donated works by artists in May 2015 raised $22.5 million for the museum endowment; the sale included works by Mark Grotjahn, Takashi Murakami and Ed Ruscha.David Ng and Deborah Vankin (May 13, 2015), Works donated by artists raise $22.5 million for Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles Los Angeles Times. Attendance MOCA exhibitions draw roughly 60% of their visitors from the L.A. area; their attendance totaled 236,104 in 2010, up by nearly 90,000 over the previous year.Jori Finkel (March 30, 2011), Attendance at L.A. museums lags behind Los Angeles Times.

Harvey Bloom) Henry de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Warwick or Henry de NewburghDavid, Crouch. \\"Beaumont [Newburgh, Henry de, first earl of Warwick\\"], Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 23 September 2004. Accessed 11 January 2019. (died 20 June 1119) was a Norman nobleman who rose to great prominence in the Kingdom of England. Origins Henry was a younger son of Roger de Beaumont by Adeline of Meulan, daughter of Waleran III, Count of Meulan, and Oda de Conteville. Early career Henry was given by his father the modest lordship of Le Neubourg, in central Normandy, to the northeast of his father's caput of Beaumont-le-Roger on the River Risle. From this lordship he adopted for himself and his descendants the surname Anglicised to \\"de Newburgh\\", frequently Latinised to de Novo Burgo (meaning \\"from the new borough/town\\"). Henry was said, by Orderic Vitalis the Norman monk historian, to have been with William the Conqueror on his 1068 campaign in the Midlands when he was supposedly given charge of Warwick Castle, but there is no supporting evidence for this late source.George Edward Cokayne, edited by Geoffrey H. White (1959). The Complete Peerage Vol. 12 part 2, p.358 Little is in fact known of his career before 1088. However, he took a leading role in reconciling the Conqueror with his eldest son Robert Curthose in 1081, so he stood high in the Conqueror's favour. In 1088 he was a royal agent in the arrest and trial of the traitorous bishop of Durham, William de Saint-Calais. Under William II Henry acquired a much greater land-holding in England when, in reward for help in suppressing the Rebellion of 1088, King William II made him Earl of Warwick in 1088. The lands of the earldom were put together from several sources. The bulk was provided by the majority of the lands in Warwickshire and elsewhere recorded as those of his elder brother Robert, Count of Meulan in the Domesday Survey of 1086. He also received large royal estates in Rutland and the royal forest of Sutton, which became Sutton Chase. The complicated arrangement to endow his earldom is unprecedented, and must have been the result of a three way arrangement between his father, his brother and the king. Under Henry I Henry became the companion and friend of King Henry I, William II's successor. When a division took place among the barons who had gathered together in the aftermath of the king's sudden death in 1100 to choose a successor, it was mainly owing to de Beaumont's advice that Henry, the conqueror's fourth son, was selected. However, in the following year most of the barons were openly or secretly disloyal and favoured the attempt of Henry's elder brother Robert Curthose, now Duke of Normandy, to gain the Crown. Henry de Beaumont and his brother Robert, King Henry's foremost advisors,Hollister, C. Warren. \\"Henry I\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 23 September 2004. Accessed 15 January 2019. were among the few that remained faithful to the King. Henry acquired the Lordship of Gower in Wales around 1107 from the favour of King Henry and built a castle at Swansea, which was unsuccessfully attacked by the Welsh in 1113; he also captured the Gower Peninsula in south west Glamorgan. He or his barons built other castles at Penrhys, Llanrhidian and Swansea in 1120, together with the others at Oystermouth and Loughor, the only remains of the latter are a mound and a keep. Marriage and issue Before 1100 Henry married Margaret (died after 1156), daughter of Geoffrey II of Perche and Beatrix of Montdidier, daughter of Hilduin IV, Count of Montdidier. They had two daughters and the following sons: # Roger, 2nd Earl of Warwick (c. 11021153), who succeeded Henry. # Robert de Neubourg (died 1159), who inherited Henry's Norman lands and was Steward of Normandy. Robert's eldest son Henry de Neubourgh (c. 11301214) inherited his lands in Normandy, while his younger son Roger de Newburgh (c. 11351192) inherited his lands in Dorset. # Rotrou (died 1183), who was successively Bishop of √âvreux and Archbishop of Rouen, Chief Justiciar and Steward of Normandy. In 1167 he led the funeral service of Empress Matilda, daughter of Henry I and mother of Henry II. # Geoffrey de Neubourg. He moved to England at the end of 1137 and resided thereafter with his eldest brother Earl Roger of Warwick. He made a number of appearances in Earl Roger's charters as \\"Geoffrey the earl's brother.\\" When Roger died in 1153 and was succeeded by his son, Earl William, \\"Geoffrey the earl's uncle\\" continued to live in the Warwick household. He appears as a ducal justice in Normandy in his later years. See Haskins Society Journal 13 (2004): 50. # Henry de Neubourg, otherwise known as \\"Henry of Gower\\". He re-conquered the family's Welsh estates in around 1136, holding the lordship of Gower throughout the reign of King Stephen. Death and legacy Henry entered the Abbey of Saint- Pierre de Pr√©aux before his death and died as a monk there on 20 June 1119. An eighteenth-century woodcut of his tomb in the chapter house, with those of his brother and father beside him, survives, though the abbey is long ruined.

Along with The Supremes, The Miracles, The Temptations, and the Four Tops, Wells was said to have been part of the charge in black music onto radio stations and record shelves of mainstream America, \\"bridging the color lines in music at the time.\\" With a string of hit singles composed mainly by Smokey Robinson, including \\"The One Who Really Loves You\\", \\"Two Lovers\\", and the Grammy- nominated \\"You Beat Me to the Punch\\", all in 1962, plus her signature hit, \\"My Guy\\" (1964), she became recognized as \\"The Queen of Motown\\" until her departure from the company in 1964, at the height of her popularity. She was one of Motown's first singing superstars. Life and career=Early life and initial recordings Mary Esther Wells was born near Detroit's Wayne State University on May 13, 1943, to a mother who worked as a domestic, and an absentee father. One of three children, she contracted spinal meningitis at the age of two and struggled with partial blindness, deafness in one ear and temporary paralysis. At age 10, Wells contracted tuberculosis. During her early years, Wells lived in a poor residential Detroit district. By age 12, she was helping her mother with house cleaning work. She described the ordeal years later: Wells used singing as her comfort from her pain and by age 10 had graduated from church choirs to performing at local nightclubs in the Detroit area. Wells graduated from Detroit's Northwestern High School at the age of 17 and set her sights on becoming a scientist, but after hearing about the success of Detroit musicians such as Jackie Wilson and the Miracles, she decided to try her hand at music as a singer-songwriter. In 1960, 17-year-old Wells approached Tamla Records founder Berry Gordy at Detroit's Twenty Grand club, with a song she had intended for Jackie Wilson to record, since Wells knew of Gordy's collaboration with Wilson. However, a tired Gordy insisted Wells sing the song in front of him. Impressed, Gordy had Wells enter Detroit's United Sound Systems to record the single, titled \\"Bye Bye Baby\\". After a reported 22 takes, Gordy signed Wells to the Motown subsidiary of his expanding record label and released the song as a single in September 1960; it peaked at number 8 on the US Billboard R&B; chart in 1961, and later crossed over to the pop singles chart, where it peaked at number 45. Wells' early Motown recordings reflected a rougher R&B; sound than the smoother style of her biggest hits. Wells became the first Motown female artist to have a Top 40 pop single after the Mickey Stevenson-penned doo-wop song \\"I Don't Want to Take a Chance\\" hit number 33 in June 1961. In the fall of that year, Motown issued her first album and released a third single, the bluesy ballad \\"Strange Love\\". When that record bombed, Gordy set Wells up with the Miracles' lead singer Smokey Robinson. Though she was hailed as \\"the first lady of Motown\\", Wells was technically Motown's third female signed act: Claudette Rogers, of Motown's first star group the Miracles, has been referred to by Berry Gordy as \\"the first lady of Motown Records\\" due to her being signed as a member of the group, and in late 1959 Detroit blues-gospel singer Mable John had signed to the then-fledgling label a year prior to Wells' arrival. Nevertheless, Wells' early hits as one of the label's few female solo acts did make her the label's first female star and its first fully successful solo artist. Success Wells's teaming with Robinson led to a succession of hit singles over the following two years. Their first collaboration, 1962's \\"The One Who Really Loves You\\", was Wells's first hit, peaking at number 2 on the R&B; chart and number 8 on the Hot 100. The song featured a calypso-styled soul production that defined Wells's early hits. Motown released the similar-sounding \\"You Beat Me to the Punch\\" a few months later. The song became her first R&B; number 1 single and peaked at number 9 on the pop chart. The success of \\"You Beat Me to the Punch\\" helped to make Wells the first Motown star to be nominated for a Grammy Award when the song was nominated for Best Rock & Roll Recording in 1963. In late 1962, \\"Two Lovers\\" became Wells's third consecutive single to hit the Top 10 of Billboards Hot 100, peaking at number 7 and becoming her second number 1 hit on the R&B; chart. This helped to make Wells the first female solo artist to have three consecutive Top 10 singles on the pop chart. The track sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. Wells's second album, also titled The One Who Really Loves You, was released in 1962 and peaked at number 8 on the pop albums chart, making the teenage singer a breakthrough star and giving her clout at Motown. Wells's success at the label was recognized when she became a headliner during the first string of Motortown Revue concerts, starting in the fall of 1962. The singer showcased a rawer stage presence that contrasted with her softer R&B; recordings. Wells's success continued in 1963 when she hit the Top 20 with the doo-wop ballad \\"Laughing Boy\\" and scored three additional Top 40 singles, \\"Your Old Standby\\", \\"You Lost the Sweetest Boy\\", and its B-side, \\"What's Easy for Two Is So Hard for One\\". \\"You Lost the Sweetest Boy\\" was one of the first hit singles composed by the successful Motown songwriting and producing trio of Holland‚ÄìDozier‚ÄìHolland, though Robinson remained Wells's primary producer. Also in 1963, Wells recorded a session of successful B-sides that arguably became as well known as her hits, including \\"Operator\\", \\"What Love Has Joined Together\\", \\"Two Wrongs Don't Make a Right\\" and \\"Old Love (Let's Try It Again)\\". Wells and Robinson also recorded a duet titled \\"I Want You 'Round\\", which would be re-recorded by Marvin Gaye and Kim Weston. In 1964, Wells recorded \\"My Guy\\". The Smokey Robinson song became her trademark single, reaching number 1 on the Cashbox R&B; chart for seven weeks and becoming the number 1 R&B; single of the year. The song successfully crossed over to the Billboard Hot 100, where it eventually replaced Louis Armstrong's \\"Hello, Dolly!\\" at number 1, remaining there for two weeks. The song became Wells's second million-selling single. To build on the song's success, Motown released a duet album recorded with fellow Motown singing star Marvin Gaye, Together. The album peaked at number 1 on the R&B; album chart and number 42 on the pop album chart, and yielded the double-sided hits \\"Once Upon a Time\\" and \\"What's the Matter With You Baby\\". \\"My Guy\\" was one of the first Motown songs to break on the other side of the Atlantic, eventually peaking at number 5 on the UK chart and making Wells an international star. Around this time, the Beatles stated that Wells was their favorite American singer, and soon she was given an invitation to open for the group during their tour of the United Kingdom, thus making her the first Motown star to perform in the UK. Wells was only one of three female singers to open for the Beatles, the others being Brenda Holloway and Jackie DeShannon. Danny Tyrell accompanied her in live shows in Detroit. Wells made friends with all four Beatles and later released a tribute album, Love Songs to the Beatles, in mid-decade. Former Motown sales chief Barney Ales described Wells's landmark success in 1964: Leaving Motown Ironically during her most successful year, Wells was having problems with Motown over her original recording contract, which she had signed at the age of 17. She was also reportedly angry that the money made from \\"My Guy\\" was being used to promote The Supremes, who had found success with \\"Where Did Our Love Go\\", just as \\"My Guy\\" was promoted, using the profits from another, earlier hit Motown song. Though Gordy reportedly attempted to renegotiate with Wells, the singer still asked to be freed from her contract with Motown. A pending lawsuit kept Wells away from the studio for several months, as she and Gordy brokered the contract details, with Wells fighting to gain a larger share of the royalties she had earned during her tenure with Motown. Finally, Wells invoked a clause that allowed her to leave the label, advising the court that her original contract was invalid, as she had signed while she was still a minor. Wells won her lawsuit and was awarded a settlement, leaving Motown officially in early 1965, whereupon she accepted a lucrative ($200,000) contract with 20th Century Fox Records. Part of the terms of the agreement of her release was that she could not receive any royalties from her past works with the label, including use of her likeness to promote herself. Career struggles A weary Wells worked on material for her new record label while dealing with other issues, including being bedridden for weeks suffering from tuberculosis. Wells's eponymous first 20th Century Fox release included the first single \\"Ain't It The Truth\\", its B-side \\"Stop Taking Me for Granted\\", the lone top 40 hit, \\"Use Your Head\\" and \\"Never, Never Leave Me\\". However, the album flopped, as did the Beatles tribute album she released not too long afterwards. Rumors have hinted Motown may have threatened to sue radio stations for playing Wells's post-Motown music during this time. After a stressful period in which Wells and the label battled over various issues after her records failed to chart successfully, the singer asked to be let go in 1965 and left with a small settlement. In 1966, Wells signed with Atlantic Records' subsidiary Atco. Working with producer Carl Davis, she scored her final Top 10 R&B; hit with \\"Dear Lover\\", which also became a modestly successful pop hit, peaking at number 51. However, much like her tenure with 20th Century Fox, the singer struggled to come up with a follow-up hit, and in 1968, she left the label for Jubilee Records, where she scored her final pop hit, \\"The Doctor\\", a song she co-wrote with then-husband Cecil Womack. (Meanwhile, she had attempted a film career, but only managed a guest starring role in 1967's \\"Catalina Caper\\".) In 1970, Wells left Jubilee for a short- lived deal with Warner Music subsidiary Reprise Records and released two Bobby Womack-produced singles. In 1972, Wells scored a UK hit with a re-issue of \\"My Guy\\", which was released on the Tamla-Motown label and climbed to number 14. Though a re-issue, Wells promoted the single heavily and appeared on the British TV show Top of the Pops for the first time. Despite this mini-revival, she decided to retire from music in 1974 to raise her family. Comeback In 1977, Wells divorced Cecil Womack and returned to performing. She was spotted by CBS Urban president Larkin Arnold in 1978 and offered a contract with the CBS subsidiary Epic Records, which released In and Out of Love in October 1981. The album, which had been recorded in 1979, yielded Wells's biggest hit in years, the funky disco single, \\"Gigolo\\". \\"Gigolo\\" became a smash at dance clubs across the country. A six-minute mix hit number 13 on Billboards Hot Dance/Club Singles chart and number 2 on the Hot Disco Songs chart. A four-minute radio version released to R&B; stations in January 1982 achieved a modest showing at number 69. It turned out to be Wells's final chart single. After the parent album failed to chart or produce successful follow-ups, the Motown-styled These Arms was released, but it flopped and was quickly withdrawn, and Wells's Epic contract fizzled. The album's failure may have been due to light promotion. She still had one more album in her CBS contract, and in 1982, released an album of cover songs, Easy Touch, which aimed for the adult contemporary radio format. Leaving CBS in 1983, she continued recording for smaller labels, gaining new success as a touring performer. On the April 21, 1984 edition of American Top 40, Casey Kasem reported that Wells was attempting to establish a hot dog chain. In 1989, Wells was celebrated with a Pioneer Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation during its inaugural year. Final years In 1990, Wells recorded an album for Ian Levine's Motorcity Records, but her voice began to fail, causing the singer to visit a local hospital. Doctors diagnosed Wells with laryngeal cancer. Treatments for the disease ravaged her voice, forcing her to quit her music career. Since she had no health insurance, her illness wiped out her finances, forcing her to sell her home. As she struggled to continue treatment, old Motown friends, including Diana Ross, Mary Wilson, members of the Temptations and Martha Reeves, made donations to support her, along with the help of admirers such as Dionne Warwick, Rod Stewart, Bruce Springsteen, Aretha Franklin and Bonnie Raitt. That same year, a benefit concert was held by fellow fan and Detroit R&B; singer Anita Baker. Wells was also given a tribute by friends such as Stevie Wonder and Little Richard on The Joan Rivers Show. In 1991, Wells brought a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Motown for royalties she felt she had not received upon leaving Motown Records in 1964 and for loss of royalties for not promoting her songs as the company should have. Motown eventually settled the lawsuit by giving her a six-figure sum. That same year, she testified before the United States Congress to encourage government funding for cancer research: Personal life Wells married twice: first, in 1960, to Detroit singer Herman Griffin. The marriage of the teenage couple was troubled from the start due to their age and Griffin's unhealthy control of Wells; they divorced in 1963. Despite rumors, she never dated fellow Motown singer Marvin Gaye, who would go on to have successful duet partnerships with Kim Weston, Tammi Terrell and Diana Ross after Wells had left Motown. In 1966, Wells married singer-songwriter Cecil Womack, formerly of the Valentinos, and the younger brother of musician Bobby Womack. The marriage lasted until 1977 and produced three children. Wells began an affair with another Womack brother, Curtis, during her marriage to Cecil. Her relationship with Curtis Womack was reportedly abusive. Wells was a notorious chain smoker and went through bouts of depression during her marriages. After separating from Cecil, she attempted suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills when word had leaked of her affair with Curtis who was married. After the failed suicide attempt, Wells sought other methods of what she called \\"meditating,\\" including using cocaine. Over time, she developed a heroin habit. Her drug habit ceased after she became pregnant with Curtis' child. After splitting from Curtis in 1990, Wells focused on raising her youngest daughter Sugar (b.1986) until her cancer appeared. Wells had four children: Cecil, Jr., Harry, Stacy (with Cecil Womack), and Sugar (with Curtis Womack). Death In the summer of 1992, Wells's cancer returned and she was rushed to the Kenneth Norris Jr. Cancer Hospital in Los Angeles with pneumonia. With the effects of her unsuccessful treatments and a weakened immune system, Wells died on July 26, 1992, at the age of 49. After her funeral, which included a eulogy given by her old friend and former collaborator, Smokey Robinson, Wells was cremated, and her ashes were laid to rest in Glendale's Forest Lawn Memorial Park, in a Womack family crypt. Family friend Sam Cooke is buried in The Garden of Honor, about to the west. Accolades Though Wells has been eligible for induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, being nominated twice in 1986 and 1987, she has yet to achieve it. Wells earned one Grammy Award nomination during her career. Her song \\"My Guy\\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. Wells was given one of the first Pioneer Awards by the Rhythm and Blues Foundation in 1989. A year later, the foundation raised more than $50,000 to help with her treatment after her illness had wiped out all of her finances. Wells was inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame in 2006. She was inducted into the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame in 2017.

He played college football at the University of Oregon. Early years Grayson attended San Diego High School, playing running back and defensive back. As a sophomore, he helped his team achieve an 11-0-1 record, while outscoring opponents 382-65 and being awarded the mythical National championship by the National Sports News Service. After the season he transferred to Lincoln High School. After graduating from high school he went on to play at San Diego City College. Besides football, in track he was a part of the 4 √ó 200 metres relay team that set a national junior college record. As a junior, he transferred to the University of Oregon, where he played offensive and defensive halfback. In 1982, he was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame. In 2010, he was inducted into the Breitbard Hall of Fame. Professional career In 1961, he was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys, but because head coach Tom Landry felt he lacked size for the physical play that was needed in NFL at the time, Chief talent scout Gil Brandt called the AFL's Dallas Texans head coach Hank Stram and suggested he give Grayson a look. Grayson made the team and played four years with the Dallas Texans/Kansas City Chiefs. In 1961, he set the franchise and AFL record for the longest interception return with a 99-yarder against the New York Titans. In 1961, he also led the league in kickoff returns. In 1962 and 1963, he finished second in the league in kickoff returns. In 1965, he was traded to the Oakland Raiders in exchange for cornerback Fred Williamson. Grayson held the AFL record for longest interception return for a touchdown, 99 yards, against the New York Titans in 1961. He had an interception off George Blanda in the Texans' 1962 double- overtime championship game victory over the defending AFL champion Houston Oilers. Grayson was an AFL All-Star six times, with the Texans/Chiefs in 1962, 1963 and 1964, and with the Raiders in 1965, 1966 and 1969. In 1967, he was moved from right cornerback to safety. He made a 48-yard return with the opening kickoff against the Oilers in the 1967 AFL Championship Game, helping his team win the game and reach Super Bowl II. In 1968, he led the AFL with 10 interceptions. His 29 interceptions rank seventh all-time in Raiders history. Grayson is the all-time AFL leader in interceptions with 47, for a 20-yard return average and 5 touchdowns, and he averaged 25.4 yards on 110 kickoff returns. He is a member of the AFL All-Time Team. In 2017, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Grayson to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2017. Personal After football he opened different businesses, which included one of the biggest nightclubs in Southeast San Diego during the seventies. He also was involved with organizations like the Boys Club, YMCA and the Committee for Community Involvement of Black Athletes. Grayson died on July 29, 2017. His son, David Lee Grayson, Jr. played linebacker in the NFL from 1987‚Äì1990 with the Cleveland Browns and in 1991 with the San Diego Chargers.

It may be performed over a sight or substance of particular interest to the animal, or may be performed with the neck stretched and the head held high in the air. Flehmen is performed by a wide range of mammals, including ungulates and felids. The behavior facilitates the transfer of pheromones and other scents into the vomeronasal organ (VNO, or Jacobson's organ) located above the roof of the mouth via a duct which exits just behind the front teeth of the animal. Etymology Flehmen response in the Sumatran tiger The word originates from the German verb flehmen, to bare the upper teeth. It comes from the Upper Saxon German flemmen, \\"to look spiteful\\". The word was introduced by Karl Max Schneider, director of the Leipzig zoo and an authority on big cats in captivity. Discovery The flehmen response was first described by Frederik Ruysch and described later by Ludwig Jacobson in 1813.Jacobson, L. (1813). \\"Anatomisk Beskrivelse over et nyt Organ i Huusdyrenes N√¶se\\". Veterin√¶r=Selskapets Skrifter [in Danish] 2,209‚Äì246. Description This response is characterized by the animal curling back its top lip exposing the front teeth and gums, then inhaling and holding the posture for several seconds. The behavior may be performed over particular locations, in which case the animal may also lick the site of interest, or may perform the flehmen with the neck stretched and head held high in the air for a more general gustatory or taste-related investigation. The flehmen response often gives the appearance that the animal is looking spiteful, grimacing, smirking or laughing. Mechanism The flehmen response draws air into the VNO or Jacobson's organ, an auxiliary olfactory sense organ that is found in many animals. This organ plays a role in the perception of certain scents and pheromones. The vomeronasal organ is named for its closeness to the vomer and nasal bones, and is particularly well developed in animals such as cats and horses. The VNO is found at the base of the nasal cavity. It is encompassed inside a bony or cartilaginous capsule which opens into the base of the nasal cavity. Animals that exhibit flehmen have a papilla located behind the incisors and ducts which connect the oral cavity to the VNO, with horses being an exception. Horses exhibit flehmen but do not have an incisive duct communication between the nasal and oral cavity because they do not breathe through their mouths; instead, the VNOs connect to the nasal passages by the nasopalatine duct. Chemical cues The chemical cue obtained by an animal exhibiting the flehmen response is the presence of a non-volatile organic compound. In contrast to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), non-volatile organic compounds are those carbon compounds that do not participate in atmospheric photochemical reactions or evaporate under normal atmospheric conditions.Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs): Technical Overview. United States Environmental Protection Agency. http://www.epa.gov/iaq/voc2.html#2. Updated April 10, 2012. Accessed May 9, 2012. The VNO detects non-VOCs, which must have direct contact with the odor source. Sources of non-VOCs relevant to the flehmen response include pheromones and hormones excreted from the genital regions or urine of animals. Function An animal may perform the flehmen response when investigating sites of particular interest, or perhaps (more generally) odors or tastes.  Intra-species communication The function of the flehmen response is intra-species communication. By transferring air containing pheromones and other scents to the vomeronasal organ (VNO), an olfactory-chemosensory organ located between the roof of the mouth and the palate, animals can gather chemical \\"messages\\". These scents tell an animal about other members of their species in some of the following ways: * Identifying reproductive status ‚Äì male individuals commonly use the flehmen response as an olfactory mechanism for identifying the reproductive state of females of the same species based on pheromones in the female's urine or genitals. This is exhibited in the reproductive behavior of sheep. The ram often exhibits flehmen after sniffing the ewes‚Äô external genital region, but this occurs most frequently on the day before estrus when the ewes are sexually receptive.Bland, K. P.; Jubilan, B. M. \\"Correlation of flehmen by male sheep with female behavior and oestrus\\". 1987. Animal Behavior 35(3): 735‚Äì8 * Reproductive synchrony ‚Äì flehmen behavior also plays a role in reproductive synchrony between females. In the sable antelope, the frequency of flehmen changes seasonally, with the highest levels just prior to conception. Female antelopes associate closely with other females in the same reproductive state. Flehmen rates between females anticipated birth synchrony. Additionally, the level of synchrony was predicted by the frequency of female urine sampling during the previous year. Flehmen is a mechanism used by female sable antelopes to manipulate the timing of both conception and birth of offspring.Thompson, K. V. \\"Flehmen and birth synchrony among female sable antelope, Hippotragus-niger\\". 1995. Animal Behavior 50: 475‚Äì84. In the American bison, flehmen behavior in females has also been shown to stimulate the onset of estrus and copulation synchronization.Wolff, J. O. Breeding strategies, mate choice, and reproductive success in American bison\\". 1998. Oikos 83(3): 529‚Äì44. Flehmen response in a New Forest pony * Post-parturition ‚Äì in horses, mares commonly show a peak in flehmen response during the first few hours after giving birth. Smelling the newborn foal and the amniotic fluids associated with birth often produces the reaction. * Immature animals ‚Äì in young horses, both colts (males) and fillies (females) exhibit flehmen behavior toward other conspecifics with neither sex performing the behavior more than the other.Weeks, J. W.; Cromwell-Davis, S. L.; Heusner, G. \\"Preliminary study of the development of the Flehmen response in Equus caballus. 2002. Applied Animal Behavior Science 78(2): 329‚Äì35. However, it has been reported that young colts flehmen up to five times more frequently than fillies, and fillies flehmen more frequently than mature mares. Young elephants also have a flehmen response to stimulants. The VNO of newborn elephants displays a structural maturity similar to adults, which supports the conclusion that flehmen at only six weeks of age is used to deliver chemical pheromones to a functional VNO. Inter-species communication The flehmen response is not limited to intra-species communication. Goats have been tested for their flehmen response to urine from 20 different species, including several non-mammalian species. This study suggests there is a common element in the urine of all animals, an interspecific pheromone, which elicits flehmen behavior. Specifically, chemical pheromone levels of a modified form of androgen, a sex hormone, were associated with the response in goats.Sasada, H.; Kanomata, K.; Fukuoka, T. \\"Flehmen induction with goats by the urine of twenty animal species\\". 1988. 11th International Congress on Animal Reproduction and Artificial Insemination, University College Dublin, Irelend, June 26‚Äì30, 1988. Volume 4. Brief Communications. Mammals exhibiting A wide range of mammals exhibit flehmen including both predatory and non- predatory species. The response is perhaps most easily observed in domestic cats and horses; both exhibit a strong flehmen response to odors. Stallions usually smell the urine of mares in estrus whereas the male giraffe's flehmen response includes actually tasting the female's urine. Elephants perform a flehmen response but also transfer chemosensory stimuli to the vomeronasal opening in the roof of their mouths using the prehensile structure, sometimes called a \\"finger\\", at the tips of their trunks. Other animals which exhibit the flehmen response include American buffalo, tigers, tapirs, lions, giraffes, goats, llamas, kobs, hedgehogs, rhinoceros, giant pandas, antelope and hippopotamuses.

In horses, it is often associated with low-grade abdominal pain.

It contains about 130 species, which are distributed in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. They are trees, with the larger species growing up to in height. The generic name is derived from the Greek word ŒµœÅœÖŒ∏œÅ√≥œÇ (erythros), meaning \\"red\\", referring to the flower color of certain species. Names Particularly in horticulture, the name coral tree is used as a collective term for these plants. Flame tree is another vernacular name, but may refer to a number of unrelated plants as well. Many species of Erythrina have bright red flowers, and this may be the origin of the common name. However, the growth of the branches can resemble the shape of sea coral rather than the color of Corallium rubrum specifically, and this is an alternative source for the name. Other popular names, usually local and particular to distinct species, liken the flowers' red hues to those of a male chicken's wattles, and/or the flower shape to its leg spurs. Commonly seen Spanish names for any local species are bucar√©, frejolillo or porotillo, and in Afrikaans some are called kafferboom (from the species name Erythrina caffra). Mullumurikku is a widespread name in Kerala. Description and ecology Asian pied starling (Gracupica contra) feeding on Indian coral tree (E. variegata) flowers in Kolkata, India. Not all species of Erythrina have bright red flowers; the Wiliwili (E. sandwicensis) has extraordinary variation in its flower colour, with orange, yellow, salmon, green and white all being found within natural populations. This striking color polymorphism is also found in Erythrina lysistemon and Erythrina caffra. All species except the sterile hybrids E. √ó sykesii and E. √ó bidwillii have legume-type fruit, sometimes called pods, containing one or more seeds. The resilient buoyant seeds are often carried by the sea for large distances and are commonly called \\"sea beans\\". Erythrina leaves are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the swift moth Endoclita damor and the woolly bears Hypercompe eridanus and Hypercompe icasia. The mite Tydeus munsteri is a pest on the coastal coral tree (E. caffra). Many birds visit the nectar-rich Erythrina flowers. In the Neotropics, these are usually larger hummingbirds, for example the swallow-tailed hummingbird (Eupetomena macroura) and the black-throated (Anthracothorax nigricollis) and green- breasted mangos (A. prevostii) - though they seem not to be especially fond of E. speciosa at least, which they visit rather opportunistically. In Southeast Asia, the black drongo (Dicrurus macrocercus) which usually does not eat nectar in quantity has been observed feeding on E. suberosa flowers, and mynas and of course more specialized nectar feeders also utilize coral tree flowers. Lorikeets such as the collared lory (Phigys solitarius) and the possibly extinct New Caledonian lorikeet (Charmosyna diadema) are known to consume (or have consumed) large amounts of Erythrina nectar. Use by humans Some coral trees are used widely in the tropics and subtropics as street and park trees, especially in drier areas. In some places, such as Venezuela, bucar√©s are used as shade trees for coffee or cocoa crops. In the Bengal region, they are used for the same purpose in Schumannianthus dichotoma plantations. E. lanceolata in particular is considered highly suitable as \\"frame\\" tree for vanilla vines to grow up on. Native Hawaiians made a number of items from wiliwili wood because of its low density, such as mouo (fishing net floats), ama (outrigger canoe floats, and extremely long papa hee nalu (surfboards) called olo. Olo, which averaged , were exclusively ridden by alii (royalty). The wood was sometimes used for the waa (hull) of outrigger canoes intended to be used near-shore, for recreation, or for training. The shiny orange-red seeds were strung into lei. The conspicuous, even dramatic coral trees are widely used as floral emblems. cockspur coral tree (E. crista-galli) is the national flower of Argentina and Uruguay. The coastal coral tree (E. caffra) is the official city tree of Los Angeles, California, where it is referred to simply as the \\"coral tree\\". The state trees of M√©rida and Trujillo in Venezuela are bucar√© ceibo (E. poeppigiana) and purple coral tree (bucar√© anauco, E. fusca), respectively. Yonabaru, Okinawa as well as the Okinawa Prefecture and Pathum Thani Province have the Indian coral tree (E. variegata) as floral emblems. Known as thong lang in Thailand, the latter species is also one of the thong (\\"trees\\") referred to in the name of Amphoe Chom Thong, Chiang Mai Province. In a similar vein, Zumpahuac√°n in Mexico derives its name from Nahuatl tzompahuac√°, \\"place of the Erythrina americana\\". In Vietnam, people use the leaves of E. variegata to wrap nem (a kind of fermented pork). In Hinduism, the mandara tree in Indra's garden in Svarga is held to be E. stricta. The same motif is found in Tibetan Buddhism, where the man da ra ba growing in Sukhavati is identified as an Indian coral tree (E. variegata). The concept of the Five Trees of Paradise is also found in Christian Gnosticism. Though as none of the trees is identified as an Erythrina here, the concept might not be as directly related to the Asian religions as some presume. Erythravine is tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid from Erythrina mulungu, studied for possible anxiolytic properties. The seeds of at least one-third of the species contain potent erythrina alkaloids, and some of these are used for medicinal and other purposes by indigenous peoples. They are all toxic to some degree, however, and the seeds of some can cause fatal poisoning. The chemical compounds found in plants in this genus include alkaloids such as scoulerine, erysodin, erysovin (namely in E. flabelliformis), and the putative anxiolytic erythravine (isolated from Mulungu, E. mulungu). Erysodienone is a precursor in the biosynthesis of many of these alkaloids. As food Root tubers of Erythrina species have been traditional food for aborigines of the Northern Territory of Australia.

He is officially styled as Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia, the Archbishop of Mtskheta-Tbilisi and Metropolitan Bishop of Bichvinta and Tskhum-Abkhazia, His Holiness and Beatitude Ilia II. Biography Ilia II was born as Irakli Ghudushauri-Shiolashvili () in Vladikavkaz, Soviet Russia's North Ossetia. His parents hailed from Georgia, particularly, the Kazbegi district; his father, Giorgi Shiolashvili, was from the village Sno, and his mother, Natalia Kobaidze, from the village Sioni. The Shiolashvili were an influential clan in the highlands of Khevi. Irakli Ghudushauri graduated from the Moscow Theological Seminary and was ordained, under the name of Ilia, a hierodeacon in 1957 and hieromonk in 1959; he graduated from the Moscow Theological Academy in 1960 and returned to Georgia, where he was assigned to the Batumi Cathedral Church as a priest. In 1961, he was promoted to hegumen and later to archimandrite. On 26 August 1963, he was chosen to be the bishop of Batumi and Shemokmedi and appointed a patriarchal vicar. From 1963 to 1972 he was also the first rector of the Mtskheta Theological Seminary‚Äîthe only clerical school in Georgia at that time. In 1967, Ilia was consecrated as the bishop of Tskhumi and Abkhazeti and elevated to the rank of metropolitan in 1969. After the death of the controversial Patriarch David V, he was elected the new Catholicos-Patriarch of Georgia on 25 December 1977. The new patriarch began a course of reforms, enabling the Georgian Orthodox Church, once suppressed by the Soviet ideology, to largely regain its former influence and prestige by the late 1980s. In 1988 there were 180 priests, 40 monks, and 15 nuns for a congregation variously estimated as being from one to three million. There were 200 churches, one seminary, three convents, and four monasteries. During the last years of the Soviet Union, he was actively involved in Georgia's social life. The patriarch oversaw the publication of a linguistically updated, modern Georgian version of the Bible, which was printed in the Gorbachov-era.Fairy von Lilienfeld, \\"Reflections on the Current State of the Georgian Church and Nation\\", 1993. The patriarch joined the people demonstrating in Tbilisi against the Soviet rule on 9 April 1989, and fruitlessly urged the protesters to withdraw to the nearby Kashueti Church to avoid the bloodshed. This peaceful demonstration was dispersed by the Soviet troops, leaving behind 22 dead and hundreds injured. During the civil war in Georgia in the 1990s, he called the rival parties to find a peaceful solution to the crisis. From 1978 to 1983, Ilia II was co-president of the World Council of Churches (WCC), an ecumenical organization the Georgian Orthodox Church had joined with other Soviet churches in 1962. In May 1997, a vocal group of conservative Orthodox clerics accused Ilia II of participating in \\"ecumenical heresy\\" and threatened schism. The patriarch hastily convened the Holy Synod and announced withdrawal from the WCC. In 2002, the then-president of Georgia Eduard Shevardnadze and Ilia II signed a concordat whereby the Georgian Orthodox Church was granted a number of privileges, and holders of the office of patriarch were given legal immunity.Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, International Religious Freedom Report for 2015, Georgia Awards and recognition As patriarch, he has received the highest Church awards from the Patriarchs of the Orthodox Churches of Antioch, Jerusalem, Alexandria, Russia, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania and almost all other Orthodox Churches. As a productive theologian and church historian, he was conferred an Honorary Doctorate of Theology from St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary in New York (1986), the Academy of Sciences in Crete (1997) and the St. Tikhon's Orthodox Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania (1998). Ilia II is an Honorary Academician of the Georgian Academy of Sciences (2003) and Hon. Fellow of the American School of Genealogy, Heraldry and Documentary Sciences. In February 2008, his grace was awarded the David Guramishvili Prize. For its supporting views regarding the monarchical restoration of the House of Bagration in Georgia, Patriarch Ilia II received the Grand Collar of the Order of the Eagle of Georgia from Prince David Bagration of Mukhrani. Views on constitutional monarchy Ilia II has a reputation as a proponent of constitutional monarchy as a form of government for Georgia. On 7 October 2007, he publicly called in a sermon for consideration of establishing a constitutional monarchy under the Bagrationi dynasty (which the Russian Empire had dispossessed of the Georgian crown early in the 19th century).Georgian Church Calls for Constitutional Monarchy.

He also made a pastoral visit, bringing food and aid, to the Russian-occupied central Georgian city of Gori and the surrounding villages which were at the verge of humanitarian catastrophe.

December 16, 2008 Initiative to incline Georgia's declining birth rate In the late 2007, concerned with Georgia's declining birth rate, Ilia II offered to personally baptize any child born to a family that already has at least two children, as long as the new child was to be born after his announcement. He conducts mass baptism ceremonies four times a year. According to the church official, the patriarch's initiative spurred a national baby boom, because being baptized by the Patriarch is a considerable honour among adherents of the Georgian Orthodox Church.

Following his comments, thousands of Georgians, led by Georgian Orthodox priests, took to the streets of Tbilisi to protest the gay rights rally. Due to escalating violence against the rally's participants the rally had to be abandoned and the activists driven in a bus to safety by the police. In his response to the event, Ilia II of Georgia deeply condemned any violence.

He was the third Republican elected to the office after Reconstruction, and the fifth overall. As of , he is also the last Republican to serve two full terms as governor. Early life and education James Grubbs \\"Jim\\" Martin was born on December 11, 1935 in Savannah, Chatham County, Georgia and subsequently raised in South Carolina. He graduated from Davidson College in 1957 with a Bachelor of Science degree. Shortly after graduation, on June 1, he married Dorothy Ann McAulay of Charlotte, North Carolina. An avid tuba player, he was a member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity and Beta Theta Pi Social Fraternity while an undergraduate at Davidson. Academic career Martin received his PhD in chemistry from Princeton University in 1960 after completing a doctoral dissertation titled \\"Stereochemistry of the Diels-Alder reaction.\\" He then served as an associate professor of chemistry at his alma mater Davidson College until 1972. As a professor at Davidson, he advised the school's Young Republicans chapter. Political career In 1966, he was elected to the Mecklenburg County Board of Commissioners. He served for seven years, chairing the body from 1967 to 1968 and briefly in 1971. He was a president of the North Carolina Association of County Commissioners. House of Representatives (1973‚Äì1985) He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1972 representing the Charlotte-based 9th Congressional district. He served there for six terms. He served as a Ways and Means Committee member, and as a House Republican Research Committee chairman. He became the first elected official to receive the Charles Lathrop Parsons Award, given by the American Chemical Society for outstanding public service by an American chemist, in 1983. In 1984, with incumbent governor Jim Hunt leaving office due to the term limit, Martin ran for the Republican nomination and won. He defeated state attorney general Rufus Edmisten by a nine-point margin. He was helped by the coattails from Ronald Reagan's landslide re- election victory. He was also helped when Lieutenant Governor Jimmy Green endorsed him after being defeated by Edmisten in the Democratic primary. Green was from eastern North Carolina, and his endorsement helped Martin win support among conservative Democrats in that part of the state.Political grudges are nothing new, Carolina Journal Online, John Hood, October 11, 2013. Retrieved April 17, 2014. Governor of North Carolina (1985‚Äì1993) While most political figures running for office were prone to make promises covering a wide range of issues from education to health care, Martin made one promise that garnered a lot of attention; he said he would address all of the priorities in the state, but his only promise was that construction on Interstate 40 from Raleigh to Wilmington, North Carolina would be finished before he left office. The long-neglected and last leg of I-40 from Barstow, California would open up the southeastern coastal area to the rest of the state. He was true to his promise; the last unfinished leg of I-40 was finished before the end of his first term. Martin was easily reelected in 1988, defeating Lieutenant Governor Bob Jordan by 13 points. In so doing, he became the only member of his party to have been elected to two terms as governor of North Carolina. He was part of a 28-year trend of Governors of North Carolina who were named James, having been preceded and succeeded by Jim Hunt, who in turn was preceded in his first term by James Holshouser. Later life In 1993 he retired from political life and became chairman of the board of the James Cannon Research Center of Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, NC.

He was the first Republican candidate to be elected as governor since 1896, when Republican Daniel L. Russell was elected as a Fusionist candidate. Holshouser's election reflected the new political realignment of the South.  Early life Holshouser was born in Boone, North Carolina in 1934 and was the son of James E. \\"Peck\\" Holshouser, who was United States Attorney in the middle district of North Carolina under President Dwight Eisenhower.Christensen, Rob. \\"Jim Holshouser, former North Carolina governor, dies at 78.\\"  Early political career  In 1962, two years after graduating from the University of North Carolina School of Law, Holshouser was elected to the first of several terms representing Watauga County in the North Carolina House of Representatives, eventually becoming minority leader. North Carolina had been virtually a one-party, Democratic-dominated state since disfranchisement of blacks in 1899; Holshouser came from one of the few areas of the state where the GOP even existed. During the 1960s and 1970s, however, a number of Southern whites began shifting their support to the Republicans. He chaired the state Republican Party from 1966 through 1972, following passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1964 and 1965 that ended segregation and authorized federal oversight and enforcement of suffrage for African Americans.  Gubernatorial career  In 1972, Holshouser defeated Jim Gardner for the Republican nomination for Governor, and then narrowly defeated Democrat Skipper Bowles in the general election with 51 percent of the vote, becoming North Carolina's first Republican governor elected since 1896. He was likely the beneficiary of coattails from Richard Nixon, who carried North Carolina and 48 other states in the Presidential election on the same ticket. Electorally, he performed well among women and younger voters, while also appealing more to blacks than more conservative Republicans such as Gardner and U.S. Senator Jesse Helms. At age 38, Holshouser was also the state's youngest governor since the nineteenth century. Upon taking office, he fired many incumbent state employees to accommodate the awarding of patronage to hundreds of Republicans who had been unable to work in the state administration under Democratic control. Holshouser lacked executive experience upon assuming gubernatorial office, and had a tendancy to react to others' proposals rather than create his own. With no veto power over the Democratic-dominated General Assembly, he also tried to avoid political conflict except over explicitly partisan issues. In some instances the legislature attempted to weaken the powers of his office. Party association aside, Holshouser maintained a good relationship with the Assembly, as most of its members had known him when he was a state representative. He enjoyed a good working relationship with Lieutenant Governor Jim Hunt, who held sway in the legislature, and during their first two years in office they minimized partisanship in dealing with each other. Holshouser came into office when North Carolina had a $265 million budget surplus, which enabled him to fulfill some of his campaign promises. He consulted Hunt on budget proposals and incorporated Hunt's plan to expand kindergarten in state education systems in his January 1973 budget. The plan was passed into law, and was gradually phased in so that by 1977 all children in North Carolina would be enrolled in kindergarten. His budget also expanded funding for state parks. Holshouser and Hunt encouraged the state legislature to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution, but it failed approval. Holshouser was a moderate Republican, which caused some chagrin among many members of his own party. The governor supported Gerald Ford for president in 1976, while Helms (a former Democrat) supported Ronald Reagan. When Reagan won the North Carolina presidential preference primary of 1976, the Republican state convention refused to appoint Holshouser as a delegate to the Republican National Convention. His accomplishments in office included consolidation of the University of North Carolina system under a Board of Governors, capital improvement funding for the community college system, statewide enrollment for children in kindergarten, and establishment of health clinics in rural areas not served by local physicians. He could not run for reelection in 1976. North Carolina governors were barred from immediate reelection at the time; while the state constitution had been amended to allow governors to run for reelection, this was not slated to take effect until 1976.  Later life  After leaving office, Holshouser returned to the practice of law (at one point forming a firm with former Democratic Gov. Terry Sanford), was elected to the Board of Governors of the University of North Carolina, and later served as a member emeritus. He also served on the Boards of St. Andrews Presbyterian College in Laurinburg, NC, and his undergraduate alma mater, Davidson College. Holshouser eventually became great friends with Democratic Lieutenant Governor Jim Hunt, who succeeded him in 1976. They served together on the North Carolina Advisory Board of DonorsChoose.

Biography He was born Henry Edward Ernest Victor de Barreto and lived in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England, as a youth. His father was Henry Aldridge, who inherited the estate of his uncle Edward Bliss of Brandon, Suffolk, a manufacturer of flintlock mechanisms for guns, and changed his surname to Bliss under the terms of his uncle's will. In 1855, Henry Bliss inherited the estate and title of his cousin the Baron de Alreyo of the Kingdom of Portugal, although he was styled the Baron de Bliss due to the conditions stated in his uncle's will. In June 1869, he was granted another bequest from Colonel Carlo Antonio Barreto of the Kingdom of Spain, with the stipulation that he change his name to Barreto, and he did so in spite of the earlier limitation from his uncle. Henry Edward Ernest Victor de Barreto was an engineer by trade and on the death of his father in 1890, became the 4th Baron de Barreto.Ruvigny, p. 21 However during the First World War he reverted to his family name of Bliss, and was known afterwards as Baron Bliss. He was apparently successful in his career, but it is not known how he obtained his fortune, whether due to business acumen or inheritance, or a combination thereof. Bliss became paralysed from the waist down in 1911 at the age of 42, likely due to polio, and was confined to a wheelchair. Despite this, he remained active. He was apparently an avid sailor, but had his yacht confiscated for war purposes during the First World War. When the war ended, he was wealthy enough to retire to a lifetime of fishing and leisure, so to that end he ordered a new 120 ft twin screw yacht from the famous Scottish yacht designer Alfred Mylne, which he christened Sea King II. In 1920, he sailed the yacht to the Bahamas, where he stayed for five years. Meanwhile, his wife Baroness Ethel Alice Bliss stayed in England, living off a portion of his fortune. The couple had no children. Although he had some property there, he eventually grew tired of Bahamanian society and decided to move on. Leaving the Bahamas behind, he sailed to Trinidad and was there for a short while when he came down with a serious bout of food poisoning. Deciding to accept a previous invitation from his friend Willoughby Bullock, who was then Attorney General of British Honduras, he sailed westward, stopping briefly in Jamaica likely for medical attention, and arriving in the Belize City harbour on 1926. Bliss's health appeared to improve over the next few weeks, and he spent much of this time sailing around the area in his launch, exploring the coastline and fishing. However, just days before his 57th birthday, his health took a turn for the worse, and doctors advised him that he was terminally ill. It was at this time that he decided he would leave the bulk of his fortune to the country, and signed a new draft of his will, dated . Several weeks later, he died on his yacht, never having landed on the Belize mainland. He was buried in Belize City, in what is now known as Bliss Park. This was a temporary arrangement, and he was later interred in a granite tomb near the sea, with a lighthouse nearby, built with funds from his estate. The burial instructions were explicitly stated in the will. The Bliss bequest At the time of his death, Bliss's fortune was worth nearly (about ). About $480,000 was claimed by the United Kingdom in inheritance taxes. His will gave specific instructions on how the money was to be used to the benefit of the citizens of British Honduras. Aside from small lifetime annuities to his wife and relatives in England and to his personal staff, the remainder of the funds was placed in a trust, executed by the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, and the Attorney General. The original monies were to be invested in British stocks and securities, and only the interest earned could be spent, and even that could not be spent on churches, dance halls or schools, except agricultural and vocational ones. One-hundred pounds sterling was to be set aside annually for a regatta, which has since been held every year on Baron Bliss Day. A peculiar condition attached to the money was that no American may be a trustee or an employee of a trustee. No explanation was given. Over the years, the trust has provided more than to fund projects, including the Bliss Institute, Bliss School of Nursing, and other capital projects across the country. , the fund was still worth roughly . National Heroes and Benefactors Day Soon after his death, the government declared to be Baron Bliss Day, a national public holiday. This was later renamed to National Heroes and Benefactors Day, and is now observed the Monday closest to , unless it falls on a Saturday or it has been moved by decree. In 2019, it was celebrated on Monday, 11 March.

During World War II, he served in Italy and was one of the players in the New Zealand Army rugby team along with Bob Stuart as fullback. All Blacks As an All Black he made his debut in 1946 against Australia. He toured South Africa in 1949 where he played in all four test matches. He also played against the 1950 British and Irish Lions. He did not play in the 1951 tour of Australia and announced his retirement from first-class rugby that year. He was bribed to play one game for the Auckland union in 1952. He then played for the Petone club in Wellington during 1954. In a publication he was described as: \\"for me (author) there will never be anyone as great as Scott. The man amazed me even in his final moments. His positional play was of course something out of the box. He was a genius and what other fullbacks had to do, Scott didn't, because he had the greatest balance, the greatest poise, that I've ever seen in any man.\\" In his autobiography, Hennie Muller stated: \\"Scott always appeared to have plenty of time, even under pressure. He loved coming into the line and his speed and elusiveness were such that he was always a danger. Altogether, the greatest player I've ever played in any position.\\" Scott was part of the Petone club committee between 1966 and 1970. Later years In 1990 Scott was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame, and in the 1995 New Year Honours he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to rugby and the community. Following the death of Fred Allen in April 2012, Scott was the oldest living All Black. He died on 16 November 2012 at his home in Whangamata, New Zealand, where he lived during his later years.

Life and career Born in Asheville, North Carolina, Moore earned undergraduate and law degrees from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he was a member of the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity. He practiced law in Sylva, North Carolina and served a term in the North Carolina House of Representatives in 1941 before entering the U.S. Army in World War II. After the war, Moore served as a North Carolina Superior Court judge from 1948 to 1958. Subsequently, Moore served as counsel for the Champion Papers company in Canton, North Carolina, while also serving on the state Board of Water Resources. He left Champion to run for Governor in 1964. He was seen as the moderate in the Democratic primary, between the conservative I. Beverly Lake, Sr. and the more progressive L. Richardson Preyer. Moore won a primary runoff with Preyer. After serving one term as governor (North Carolina governors were not then eligible to be re-elected), Moore's successor, Governor Robert W. Scott, appointed him to the North Carolina Supreme Court, the first governor of North Carolina to be so honored. He served on the Court from November 20, 1969 until December 31, 1978. At the 1968 Democratic National Convention Moore received 17¬Ω votes for president on the first ballot, finishing fifth behind Vice President Hubert Humphrey (1,760¬Ω), Sen. Eugene McCarthy (601), Sen. George McGovern (146¬Ω), and Rev. Channing E. Phillips (67¬Ω). Moore received 12 of North Carolina's 59 votes, 3 from Virginia, 2 from Georgia and ¬Ω vote from Alabama. He is buried in historic Oakwood Cemetery in Raleigh, North Carolina. On April 1, 2017, a North Carolina historical marker was dedicated at Mark Watson Park, in Sylva, North Carolina, in recognition of Moore's significant impact on the state's judicial system.

Referred to as Motown's \\"soul supergroup\\", the Miracles recorded 26 Top 40 Pop hits, sixteen of which reached the Billboard Top 20, seven top 10 singles, and a number one single (\\"The Tears of a Clown\\") while the Robinsons and Tarplin were members. Following the departure of Tarplin and the Robinsons, the rest of the group continued with singer Billy Griffin and managed by Martin Pichinson who helped rebuild the Miracles, they scored two final top 20 singles, \\"Do It Baby\\" and \\"Love Machine\\", a second No. 1 hit, which topped the charts before the group departed for Columbia Records in 1977, recording as a quintet with Billy's brother Donald Griffin replacing Marv Tarplin, where after a few releases, they disbanded in 1978. In all, the group had over fifty charted hits by the time they disbanded. On the R&B; charts, the Miracles scored 26 Top 10 Billboard R&B; hits, with 4 R&B; No. 1's, and 11 U.S. R&B; Top 10 Albums, including 2-No.1's. Bobby Rogers and Ronald White revived the group as a touring ensemble sporadically during the 1980s and again in the 1990s. Following White's death in 1995, Rogers continued to tour with different members until he was forced into retirement due to health issues in 2011, dying less than two years later. The Miracles have been awarded many top music industry honors over the years. In 1997, the group received the Pioneer Award at the Rhythm and Blues Foundation for their musical achievements. Four years later, in 2001, they were inducted to the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. In 2004, they were ranked No. 32 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, retaining that same position seven years later, in 2011. Four of their hit songs were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame (The most of any Motown group). In 2009, the group received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Throughout their careers, the Miracles were also enshrined with honors for their songwriting by both BMI and ASCAP. In 2008, Billboard listed them at No. 61 on their 100 most successful Billboard artists ever list. After much controversy, the Miracles were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012. The group's extensive work with Berry Gordy and Tamla Records gave the Motown Record Corporation its first million-selling hit record with the 1960 Grammy Hall of Fame smash, \\"Shop Around\\", and further established themselves as one of Motown's top acts with the hit singles \\"You've Really Got a Hold on Me\\", \\"What's So Good About Goodbye\\", \\"Way Over There\\", \\"I'll Try Something New\\", \\"Mickey's Monkey\\", \\"Going to a Go-Go\\", \\"(Come 'Round Here) I'm the One You Need\\", \\"Just A Mirage\\", \\"If You Can Want\\", \\"More Love\\", \\"I Don't Blame You at All\\", \\"Ooo Baby Baby\\", the multi-award-winning \\"The Tracks of My Tears\\",\\"My Girl Has Gone' \\"Special Occasion\\", \\"I Second That Emotion\\", \\"Baby Baby Don't Cry\\", the number-one Pop smashes \\"The Tears of a Clown\\" and \\"Love Machine\\", \\"Do It Baby\\", and \\"That's What Love Is Made Of\\", among numerous other hits. History=Initial career and success The Miracles in 1962, clockwise from top left: Bobby Rogers, Marv Tarplin, Ronald White, Claudette Robinson, and Smokey Robinson ‚Äì Pete Moore had been drafted into the Army at the time this photo was taken. The group that later became the Miracles was formed in 1955 by five teenage friends from Detroit, Michigan, under the name the Five Chimes. Three of the founding members, Smokey Robinson, Warren \\"Pete\\" Moore, and Ronnie White, had been singing together since they each were around the age of eleven. The group, influenced by acts such as Billy Ward and His Dominoes and Nolan Strong & the Diablos, featured Clarence Dawson and James Grice in the original lineup. All of the group's original members attended Northern High School in Detroit. After Dawson quit the group and Grice dropped out to get married, they were replaced by Emerson \\"Sonny\\" Rogers and his cousin Bobby and changed their name to the Matadors. Coincidentally, both Smokey Robinson and Bobby Rogers were born in the same hospital on the same date (February 19, 1940), despite not actually meeting each other until they were fifteen. In 1957, Sonny Rogers left to join the United States Army and Claudette Rogers, his sister, who had been singing with the sister group the Matadorettes, joined them shortly afterwards, and in 1958, the group became the Miracles. Following two years of courtship, Smokey and Claudette married in November 1959. The group auditioned for Brunswick Records in front of Alonzo Tucker (an original member of the Midnighters who had since left the group to join Jackie Wilson's management team), Nat Tarnopol (Jackie Wilson's manager) and one of the label's staff songwriters, Berry Gordy, who remained quiet during the audition. Tucker was unimpressed by the audition, stating that because there was the Platters that \\"there couldn't be two groups in America like that with a woman in the group.\\" After the Tarnopol and Tucker rejection, Gordy followed them and soon agreed to work with the group after discovering Robinson's notebook full of songs he had written and having been impressed with Robinson's singing voice. Gordy recorded their first single, \\"Got a Job\\", an answer song to the Silhouettes' \\"Get a Job\\" in January 1958. Gordy shortly thereafter struck a deal with George Goldner's End Records to distribute the single. Before the song was released, the group changed their name to the Miracles, taking it from the moniker \\"Miracletones\\", with the \\"'Tones\\" taken out. After earning only $3.19 for his production success, Gordy was told by Robinson to form his own label, which Gordy did, forming Tamla Records in 1959. One of the Miracles' first Tamla singles, the ballad \\"Bad Girl\\", became the Miracles' first song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 Pop chart that October when it was licensed to and issued nationally by Chess Records. The next Miracles song, \\"It\\", was credited to \\"Ron & Bill\\", in a duet between White and Robinson, and was released on Tamla and nationally picked by Chess subsidiary Argo Records. Following a dismal reception at the Apollo Theater in 1959, Robinson recruited guitarist Marv Tarplin to join them on a few touring dates after Tarplin played with the Primettes (later the Supremes), with Tarplin officially joining the Miracles shortly afterwards. The addition of Tarplin was the final element in making the Miracles' \\"classic lineup\\" complete.The Supremes: A Saga of Motown Dreams, Success, and Betrayal- Page 65 In 1960, the Miracles reached the charts with \\"Way Over There\\", their second national hit, which Robinson wrote and based on the Isley Brothers' \\"Shout\\". Later that year, the Miracles released \\"Shop Around\\", backed with \\"Who's Lovin' You\\", which became the group's first smash hit, reaching number one on the R&B; charts, number two on the Billboard Hot 100, and number one on the Cash Box Magazine \\"Top 100\\" Pop Chart, and was the first Motown single to sell a million copies. Both sides of this record became classics, and standards for R&B; and rock musicians alike for several decades afterwards. As a result of this success, the Miracles became the first Motown act to appear on Dick Clark's \\"American Bandstand\\" on December 27, 1960. The Miracles had modest success with their next few singles, including \\"Ain't It Baby\\", \\"Mighty Good Lovin'\\", \\"Brokenhearted\\" and \\"Everybody's Gotta Pay Some Dues\\", as 1961 continued. During this early period, the group suffered some problems as Robinson caught Asian Flu and had to be bedded for a month, leaving wife Claudette Robinson to lead the Miracles on tour until he recovered. Claudette herself had her share of problems, having suffered her first miscarriage that occurred after a car accident and Pete Moore was drafted to serve in the United States Army. The group's next charted successes included \\"What's So Good About Goodbye\\", and the string-laden \\"I'll Try Something New\\". \\"The Showstoppers\\" The group reached the top ten again with \\"You've Really Got a Hold on Me\\" (another Grammy Hall of Fame-inducted hit) in 1962, featuring lead vocals by Smokey Robinson and Bobby Rogers. (This song actually began life as the \\"B\\" side to the group's intended \\"A\\" side, \\"Happy Landing\\", but the nation's Dee Jays flipped the song over, because they liked \\"Hold on Me\\" better). The Miracles hit the top ten still a third time the following year with the Holland-Dozier-Holland-written-and-produced song \\"Mickey's Monkey\\". The group's exciting live performances were so well received, they were often referred to as \\"The Showstoppers\\". The Miracles' success paved the way for all future Motown stars, and, as Motown's first group, they would serve as the prototype for all other Motown groups to follow. The Miracles had become a national sensation, and their success catapulted them to the position of Motown's top-selling act, making them headliners at the nationwide Motortown Revue package touring shows, which showcased Motown artists, and that started around late 1962. The Miracles were also the first Motown act to receive coaching and instruction from famed choreographer Cholly Atkins, who had previously worked with Little Anthony & the Imperials, the Cadillacs, and future Motown act Gladys Knight & the Pips. (Bobby Rogers, the Miracles' best dancer, did choreography for the group prior to Atkins' arrival). Through his association with the Miracles, Atkins came into Motown at their insistence, and soon became the official in-house choreographer for all of the company's acts, including the Temptations, the Marvelettes, the Four Tops, the Contours, Martha & the Vandellas, and the Supremes.Motown: The Golden Years, p.132 Songwriting In addition to penning their own material, Miracles Robinson, White, Rogers, Tarplin, and Moore wrote for many of their labelmates as well. Motown hits written, but not recorded, by members of the Miracles include songs for the Temptations (\\"The Way You Do The Things You Do\\", \\"My Girl\\", \\"Don't Look Back\\", \\"Since I Lost My Baby\\", \\"It's Growing\\", \\"Get Ready\\", \\"My Baby\\"), Mary Wells (\\"My Guy\\", \\"The One Who Really Loves You\\", \\"What Love Has Joined Together\\", \\"Two Lovers\\"), Marvin Gaye (\\"I'll Be Doggone\\", \\"Ain't That Peculiar\\", \\"One More Heartache\\"), the Marvelettes (\\"Don't Mess With Bill\\", \\"My Baby Must Be a Magician\\", \\"The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game\\"), The Contours (\\"First I Look at the Purse), and Brenda Holloway (\\"When I'm Gone\\"). Unlike other Motown artists, whose songs were written for them by staff songwriters, the Miracles were one of the few Motown acts that composed their own songs, adding to the group's already impressive reputation. Around 1964, Smokey Robinson became Motown's vice president, while the other members of the Miracles also began to work staff jobs with the company. Smokey and Claudette Robinson made plans to begin a family, but the rough life of touring caused Claudette to have several miscarriages. In early 1964, Claudette decided to retire from the road and remain at home in Detroit after another miscarriage, her sixth. From this point on, Claudette did not tour with the Miracles or appear in any official group photographs or on television, although she remained as a non-touring member of the Miracles , and continued to sing backup with the group in the studio until 1972. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2V32NxPaeo After Claudette Robinson's departure, the remaining Miracles appeared on The T.A.M.I. Show, a landmark 1964 concert film released by American International Pictures that included performances by numerous popular rock and roll and R&B; musicians from the United States and England, filmed and recorded live at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium on October 28 and 29, 1964. This film had theatrical release in theatres across the United States, and also included performances by fellow Motown artists the Supremes and Marvin Gaye, along with Chuck Berry, Lesley Gore, the Beach Boys, the Rolling Stones, and James Brown and the Famous Flames. The Miracles' performance was one of the show's highlights, called \\"athletically electrifying\\" by critics. Miracles chart hit singles that year included \\"That's What Love Is Made Of\\" and \\"I Like It Like That\\". In early 1965, the group released Motown Records' first double album, The Miracles Greatest Hits from the Beginning, which was a success on Billboard's Pop and R&B; Album Charts. Also in 1965, the Miracles released their landmark Top 10 album, Going to a Go-Go, under the new group name of Smokey Robinson and the Miracles. This album launched four top 20 singles into the Billboard Hot 100, including the landmark million-selling Grammy Hall of Fame single, \\"The Tracks of My Tears\\", \\"Ooo Baby Baby\\", \\"Going to a Go-Go\\" and \\"My Girl Has Gone\\", all of which became top ten R&B; hit singles as well. During this period, their music had also made its way abroad, influencing several British groups along the way. The effects of this influence soon became even more pronounced when the Beatles, the Hollies, the Zombies, the Who, and the Rolling Stones all began recording covers of Miracles hits. Members of the Beatles, in particular, publicly stated that the music of the Miracles had greatly influenced their own. Around this time, the group had begun performing in nightclubs and other high-profile venues after years on the Chitlin' Circuit. According to an Ebony article on the group, the group began grossing $150,000 a year due to royalties and personal investments. They also were making between $100,000 and $250,000 for nightly shows. In addition, the Miracles appeared on many of the popular variety television programs of the period, including The Ed Sullivan Show, Shindig!, Hullabaloo, American Bandstand, Where The Action Is, The Mike Douglas Show, The Andy Williams Show,Teen Town,Hollywood A Go-Go, Upbeat, and Britain's Ready Steady Go!. The Miracles' success continued with several hits including \\"(Come 'Round Here) I'm the One You Need\\", \\"More Love\\", \\"Special Occasion\\", \\"If You Can Want\\", and the Top 10 hit \\"I Second That Emotion\\". Around this time, the group was starting to be billed as Smokey Robinson and the Miracles on several of their albums. The name change did not appear on their singles until the release of \\"The Love I Saw in You Was Just a Mirage\\", a Top 20 hit released in 1967. On that song's flipside was the tune \\"Come Spy with Me\\". The Miracles sang the original theme to the 1967 20th Century Fox film of the same name. The year 1968 brought a second \\"greatest hits\\" collection, The Miracles Greatest Hits, Vol. 2, which was the group's second Top 10 album, which featured the most popular singles from their successful Going to a Go-Go, Away We A Go-Go and Make It Happen albums of the 1965‚Äì67 period. Also in 1968, the group released their hit album Special Occasion which spawned 3 Top 40 singles, including the smash \\"If You Can Want\\", which the group performed on their first appearance on CBS' The Ed Sullivan Show, at the time considered television's top talent and entertainment showcase. The Miracles performing on The Smokey Robinson Show, a 1970 ABC Television special. (L-to-R) Bobby Rogers, Smokey Robinson, Ronnie White.(Pete Moore was sidelined with a leg injury) However, due to constant changes in the music industry and Motown, by 1969, Smokey Robinson sought to leave the Miracles and the stage, to settle for continued work as Motown's vice president as well as become more of a family man to his wife Claudette and their children. The year 1969 had brought a second Ed Sullivan Show appearance for the group, singing their then-current singles \\"Doggone Right\\", and their hit cover of Dion's \\"Abraham, Martin and John\\". Robinson's departure plans however, were thwarted after the group's 1969 song \\"Baby Baby Don't Cry\\" hit the Billboard Pop Top 10, and when the Miracles' 1967 song, \\"The Tears of a Clown\\",(their fourth Grammy Hall of Fame-inducted hit) was released as a single in 1970, it became a number-one hit in the UK. It was subsequently released in the U.S., where it duplicated its U.K. success, reaching number 1 on the 'Billboard Hot 100 Pop Chart and selling over 3 million copies. As a result, the Miracles became hotter than ever, and Robinson decided to stay with the group for another two years. In 1970, the group were given their own ABC television special, The Smokey Robinson Show, which starred the Miracles, with guest stars the Supremes, the Temptations, Stevie Wonder, and Fran Jeffries.The Smokey Robinson Show (1970) (TV) at the Internet Movie Database In 1971, they scored one more top 20 hit with 1971's \\"I Don't Blame You at All\\". In 1972, Robinson made good on his promise to leave the Miracles, starting a six-month tour which ended in July 1972 at Washington, D.C., later introducing Billy Griffin as his official replacement. This series of final live Miracles concerts with Robinson was released by Motown on the double album Smokey Robinson & The Miracles: 1957‚Äì1972 (Tamla TS320). About that final tour, Miracle Pete Moore stated: \\"We had 12 farewell engagements playing to sold-out houses. It was amazing.\\" Also released that year was the group's final studio album with Smokey, Flying High Together, with its lead single \\"We've Come Too Far to End It Now\\" reaching the Billboard R&B; Top Ten (their 23rd visit to the Top Ten of that chart). After Smokey's retirement, Billy Griffin was introduced to national television audiences on NBC's The Midnight Special, on an episode guest-starring the Miracles and hosted by Smokey Robinson, broadcast on July 13, 1973. Within a year afterwards, Marv Tarplin also decided to leave the group and continued working with Robinson on his solo material, while Claudette, who had essentially retired from the Miracles' live performances in 1964, permanently left the Miracles when her husband Smokey did, retiring from recording with them as well. Later career In 1973, the Miracles, with Griffin, re-emerged with the critically acclaimed album, Renaissance ‚Äì their first without Smokey Robinson on lead vocals, which included the Marvin Gaye composition, \\"I Love You Secretly\\", \\"What Is a Heart Good For\\" (the intended first single), and the charting single,\\"Don't Let It End (Til You Let It Begin)\\". The following year, in 1974, after releasing the much-covered single \\"Give Me Just Another Day\\", the group had their first top 20 hit in three years with the million-selling funk song, \\"Do It Baby\\".The Book of Golden Discs ‚Äì by Joseph Murrells, pgs 348 & 361 This was followed by the top 10 R&B; hit, \\"Don't-Cha Love It.\\" Late that following year, the group recorded the disco smash, \\"Love Machine\\", which came off their self-written- and-produced hit album, City of Angels. \\"Love Machine\\" reached number-one on the Hot 100 in early 1976, the Miracles' first since \\"Tears of a Clown\\", and later sold over 4.5 million copies. The Miracles, who had long been written off by the music industry, had proven that they could have big hits without Robinson. Despite this success,however, in 1976, the Miracles' relationship with Motown imploded during contract renewals after their contract with the label had expired. When Motown, then going through a contract issue with Stevie Wonder, advised the group to wait \\"six months\\" to discuss a new contract, the group took on an offer to sign with Columbia Records, signing with them in 1977. Following this, Billy's brother Donald joined them on lead guitar, replacing Marv Tarplin. The group immediately had problems after signing with Columbia, starting with the release of their first Columbia single, \\"Spy For Brotherhood\\". Expecting controversy from the single as well as possible threats from the FBI, Columbia pulled the song from the airwaves. The group failed to have a hit during their short Columbia run and in 1978, Pete Moore decided to retire from the road while Billy Griffin wanted to return to his solo career, leading to the group to disband. In 1980, Ronnie White and Bobby Rogers decided to carry on with the Miracles as a touring unit replacing Pete Moore and Billy Griffin with Dave Finley and Carl Cotton, which carried on for three years as \\"The New Miracles\\". This version of the Miracles was short-lived though after White decided to retire from show business following the death of his wife Earlyn, who died from breast cancer in 1983, disbanding the group again. Around this same time, most of the original Miracles including Smokey Robinson and Claudette Robinson as well as Pete Moore, Marv Tarplin, and Bobby Rogers reunited to perform a medley of their songs on the 1983 NBC television special, Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever. Ron White was attending his wife Earlyn's funeral around this time, and did not participate in the reunion. Following his exit from the Miracles, Smokey Robinson enjoyed a successful solo career; in 1979, he and Tarplin co- wrote his signature hit, \\"Cruisin'\\". Following his reunion with the original Miracles on Motown 25, Robinson became dependent on cocaine, which affected his life and career. He broke the addiction in the late 1980s and revived his singing career, with the Grammy-winning Top 10 hit single, \\"Just to See Her\\".Just to See Her In 1986, Smokey's marriage with Claudette Robinson ended in divorce while Bobby's marriage to Marvelettes member Wanda Young ended in 1975. After the release of a 35th anniversary commemorative compilation album in 1993, Ronnie White and Bobby Rogers decided to regroup the Miracles yet again, with Dave Finley returning to the fold and Sydney Justin , a former NFL player and former member of Shalamar, as lead singer. Rogers replaced Justin with Mark Scott, who toured the world as lead singer of the group. Both Justin and ScottThe Miracles featuring Mark Scott lead separate Miracles groups. Two years later, Ronnie White died from a longtime bout with leukemia, leaving the remaining Miracles as a trio until Tee Turner joined the group in 2001. Following White's death in 1995, Rogers continued to tour with different members. In 2009, the group received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame with Bobby Rogers, Berry Gordy, Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder, Pete Moore, Claudette Robinson, and Billy Griffin in attendance. Following another PBS appearance, Rogers was forced into retirement due to health issues, dying less than two years later. Bobby Rogers died in March 2013, 2 weeks after his 73rd birthday. Pete Moore died November 19, 2017, on his 79th birthday. Former members Carl Cotton, Marv Tarplin and Donald Griffin are also deceased (in 2003, 2011, and 2015 respectively).  Accolades, Hollywood Walk of Fame, and 2012 induction  During their tenure, the Miracles were awarded several times for their songwriting work from both the BMI and ASCAP songwriting and licensing organizations. In 1997, the Miracles were honored by the Rhythm and Blues Foundation with the Pioneer Award for their contributions to music. In 2001, the group was inducted to the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. Three years later, the Miracles were included in Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time at No. 32, still holding to that position in a revised 2011 edition, making the Miracles the highest-ranking Motown group on the Rolling Stone listing. In both editions, they were immortalized by rock musician Bob Seger, who grew up a Miracles fan. In 2006, Woodbridge Estates, an exclusive residential development in Detroit, named their community park \\"Miracles Park\\" and one of its streets \\"Miracles Boulevard\\", in recognition of the legendary Motown group's importance to the city, and as a tribute to their many accomplishments in the music industry. In June 2006, the Miracles were voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame. In 2009, all the known members of the group (including Billy Griffin) got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, attended by Berry Gordy and Stevie Wonder, who thanked the Miracles (in particular Ronnie White, who had brought the then 11-year-old to Motown's studios), for discovering him. Wonder stated: \\"Were it not for the Miracles, there would not be a Stevie Wonder\\". Gordy added that without the Miracles, \\"Motown would not be the Motown that it is today.\\" Also in 2009, Motown released a special 2-CD compilation: The Miracles ‚Äì Depend on Me: The Early Albums, a collection consisting of the group's first 5 albums.In 2011, the Miracles were inducted to the Doo-Wop Hall of Fame. That same year, Goldmine magazine named them as one of the twenty greatest doo-wop groups of all time. Finally, in 2012, 25 years after frontman Smokey Robinson's controversial solo induction, the rest of the original Miracles were inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, with Robinson inducting them along with five other groups. The inducted members were original members Claudette Rogers- Robinson, Pete Moore, Bobby Rogers, Ronnie White (posthumously), and Marv Tarplin (posthumously). On October 4, 2015 the Miracles were inducted into the Official Rhythm & Blues Music Hall of Fame in Detroit, MI. Legacy The Miracles and their music have had worldwide impact, influencing scores of artists of many different musical genres around the globe. The original lineup of the group has consistently been revered by several critics in major rock and music magazines and have received numerous honors and awards for their contributions to the music industry. One of their most honored songs, \\"The Tracks of My Tears\\", was included in the United States Library of Congress' National Recording Registry because of its \\"culturally, historically and aesthetically significance\\" in 2008.

In addition, \\"You Really Got a Hold on Me\\", \\"Going to a Go-Go\\", \\"Shop Around\\" and \\"Tracks of My Tears\\" were inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as part of their list of The 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll . In addition,The Miracles hit ‚Äî ‚ÄúThe Tracks of My Tears,‚Äù has been selected by the National Recording Preservation Board for the United States Library of Congress‚Äô National Recording Registry, which honors and preserves culturally, historically and aesthetically signiÔ¨Åcant American recordings. The group was also ranked No. 61 on VH-1's 100 Greatest Rock Stars of All Time in 1998 while also ranking at No. 71 on Billboard's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time in 2008.They have also been inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame as of 2014. and the R&B; Music Hall of Fame in 2015. Commenting to Rolling Stone Magazine, Bob Seger said: \\"I used to go to the Motown Revues, and the Miracles always closed the show. They were that good, and everybody knew it.\\" Producer Quincy Jones called the group the \\"Beethovens of The 20th Century\\" due to their songwriting talents.Smokey Robinson and the Miracles: The Definitive Performances (1963‚Äì1987) In addition, the Miracles have been regarded as the most covered act in Motown's roster and have influenced numerous artists worldwide in the last 50 years. The success of the Miracles actually launched the Motown Records label, and, according to Motown Records founder, Berry Gordy, without the Miracles, the Motown Record Corporation would not have been possible. The 1987 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame controversy In 1987, former Miracles lead singer Smokey Robinson was inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist, without his fellow Miracles, which Robinson expressed deep regret and disappointment that his group-mates weren't inducted with him. This solo induction triggered shockwaves and cries of protest throughout the music industry. In an article in the oldies music magazine Goldmine, editor Phil Marder stated: \\"How did Smokey Robinson get inducted without (the rest of) the Miracles?\\" \\"Robinson certainly deserves solo induction due to his songwriting, producing, solo career and his contributions in many official capacities in Motown‚Äôs front office. But if the Supremes got in with Diana Ross and the Vandellas made it in with Martha Reeves and the three other Tops made it in with Levi Stubbs, how could the Miracles, who were much more important, not get in with Smokey?\\" Miracles bass singer Pete Moore told the Cleveland Plain Dealer, \\"It was a slap in the face, very disappointing. We are the premier group of Motown. We were there before there was a Motown. We set the pace for all the other artists to come after us. We were a little older, and the other artists looked up to us. How could we not be in there?\\" Moore later stated, \\"When Terry Stewart [Rock Hall president and CEO] called and told me we were to be inducted, he was apologetic,\\" Moore said. \\"He said it should have been done years ago, everybody knew it. He said they received many, many calls over the years from angry (Miracles) fans.\\" Robinson had told Billboard that he had been lobbying for the Miracles since his own induction, \\"making calls and signing petitions and everything, because they really deserve it.\\" Though some felt Robinson should've been included as an inductee with the other Miracles, Robinson said, \\"I don't really even care about that. I'm already in there. I don't understand why it was, like, a task to get the Miracles in there. We were one of the hottest and most prolific groups in the world at that time, so I don't understand the hesitancy.\\" Claudette Robinson stated, \\"When I spoke to (Rock and Roll Hall of Fame & Museum President and CEO) Terry Stewart, he said he got no less than 900 e-mails per day saying the Miracles should be inducted, and why aren't they? I was surprised by that. I would think five or 10, but he said that amount, so it's a lot of people that were really pulling for us. You have to be thankful and grateful for that.\\" However, before this decision, Miracle Marv Tarplin died in September 2011 at the age of 70, just months before the induction ceremony. In 2015 the Miracles were inducted into The Official Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame in Detroit, MI. On their website it is stated that the Miracles' exclusion from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was \\"outrageous\\", pointing out Robinson's solo induction went against its own rules. Robinson had only spent 14 years as a solo performer and his name wasn't in front of the group's until 1967. It further stated the Miracles were \\"the heartbeat of Motown in the 1960s, one of the best vocal groups ever formed and owners of some of the greatest records Rock has ever produced.\\" It was also stated that with the Miracles' induction, the Hall of Fame \\"remedied its most shameful chapter and the biggest miracle is it took this long to do it.\\" In May 2016, The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences paid tribute to the Miracles with a special year-long career retrospective of the group at The Grammy Museum in Los Angeles entitled : \\"Legends of Motown: Celebrating the Miracles\\", highlighting their groundbreaking history and accomplishments as Motown's first recording artists, with appearances by original Miracles Claudette Rogers-Robinson and Pete Moore. The Miracles are four-time Grammy Hall of Fame Inductees. At this special showing,as an expression of her gratitude, Ms Robinson stated: \\"It is my honor to be recognized by the GRAMMY Museum's Legends of Motown series. I am very grateful that the GRAMMY Museum has provided a platform for fans to experience the history of the Miracles and include items from my private collection to be displayed. The Miracles along with Mr. Berry Gordy and Motown have become a part of musical history that changed the landscape of popular music, soul and R&B; to foster positive and progressive race relations in America and around the world. Thank you for the amazing opportunity.\\" In a tribute to Motown's first group, Martha Reeves of Martha and the Vandellas stated: \\"In Liverpool they have a statue of the Beatles. Someplace in Detroit there should be a statue of (Smokey Robinson and) the Miracles.\\" Cover versions and influenceAwards and achievementsMembers Original members: * Claudette Rogers Robinson (1957-1972, 1983, occasional appearances between 1993‚Äì2011) * Ronald \\"Ronnie\\" White (1955‚Äì1978, 1980‚Äì1983, 1993‚Äì1995) died 1995 * Robert \\"Bobby\\" Rogers (1955-1978, 1980‚Äì1983, 1993‚Äì2011) died 2013 * Warren \\"Pete\\" Moore (1955‚Äì1978) died 2017 * William \\"Smokey\\" Robinson, Jr. (1955‚Äì1972, 1983) * Marv Tarplin (1959-1973) died 2011 Discography The Miracles *Hi...

Her keel was laid down by Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company of Manitowoc, Wisconsin. She was launched on 9 April 1944 sponsored by Mrs. E. S. Hutchinson, and commissioned on 31 July with Commander R. L. Rutter in command. Departing Manitowoc 20 August, Kete sailed via New Orleans, Louisiana, to Panama. Arriving 5 September, she trained with SubRon 3 until 28 September; then the new submarine sailed to Pearl Harbor, arriving 15 October, and steamed westward on 31 October for her first war patrol. She topped off her fuel at Midway Island on 4 November and reached her assigned patrol area in the East China Sea on 15 November in company with . Harassed by heavy weather and nonfunctioning bow planes, she sailed 19 November for Saipan, where she arrived 24 November. She departed Saipan with on 24 December and resumed her war patrol north of Okinawa four days later. Despite prolonged periods of heavy weather, she made lifeguard patrols off the central Ryukyu Islands from 1 January to 27 January 1945 searching for American fliers downed during air strikes on the Ryukyu Islands. After gathering vital weather data, she sailed to Guam and arrived 30 January for refit. With Lieutenant Commander Edward Ackerman in command, Kete cleared Guam on 1 March for her second war patrol. Assigned to waters surrounding the Nansei Shoto Chain, she resumed lifeguard duty and gathered weather data for the forthcoming invasion of Okinawa. While patrolling west of Tokara Retto on the night of 9 March and 10 March, she surprised an enemy convoy and torpedoed three marus totaling 6881 tons (the Japanese troop transport Keizan Maru (2116 GRT) and the Japanese army cargo ships Sanka Maru (2495 GRT) and Dokan Maru (2270 GRT)https://usnamemorialhall.org/index.php/EDWARD_ACKERMAN,_LCDR,_USN). During the night of 14 March, she attacked a cable-laying ship. With only three torpedoes remaining, she was ordered to depart the area 20 March, refuel at Midway Island, and proceed to Pearl Harbor for refit. Kete acknowledged these orders 19 March; and, while steaming eastward the following day, she sent in a weather report from a position south of Colnett Strait. She was neither seen nor heard from again. She was scheduled to arrive Midway by 31 March; when repeated attempts to contact her by radio failed she was reported as presumed lost on 16 April. Circumstances surrounding her loss remain a mystery. The cause could have been an operational malfunction, a mine explosion, or enemy action. Some Western sources credit the medium-size Japanese submarine (type Kaich≈´) with the sinking of Kete but the only indisputable fact is that this submarine crossed the same area on the day Kete sent a weather report there. Ro-41 was possibly sunk on 23 March 1945, three days after a supposed kill. It is very unlikely the Japanese captain (Lt Honda) would not report such an attack. It is even emphasized by the last radio contact with Ro-41, happening on 22 March 1945 and mentioning just \\"sighting an enemy destroyer\\". Kete received one battle star for World War II service.

Early life and education  Umstead was born in the northern Durham County town of Bahama in 1895. In 1916, he earned a bachelor's degree in history from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where, like several of North Carolina's UNC-alumni Governors before him, he was a member of the Philanthropic Society. Reflecting on his time as a Phi, in 1948 Umstead (then a U.S. Senator) asserted in an article to the Daily Tar Heel \\"If I had in my hand everything I learned in the halls of [the Philanthropic Society] and in my left hand everything I learned in the University, I wouldn't swap my experiences in debating for other things I've learned here in the University.\\"  Career  Umstead taught high school history for approximately one school year before joining the army after the U.S. entry into World War I. He served as an officer and saw combat in France; Umstead was discharged in 1919 as a first lieutenant. He later entered law school at Trinity College (now Duke University). Umstead was a prosecutor for most of his legal career and served as the elected solicitor (today called district attorney) for a five-county district from 1927 to 1933. He served from 1933 to 1939 in the United States House of Representatives, choosing not to seek re-election in 1938. Umstead was chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party for several years until he was appointed to fill a vacant United States Senate seat in 1946. Defeated for a Senate term of his own in 1948, Umstead ran for governor in 1952 and won. However, on 10 January 1953, only two days after his inauguration, Umstead was crippled by a heart attack. In June, 1954, Umstead appointed Sam Ervin to fill the U.S. Senate seat of Clyde Hoey, who had died in office.  Death  Umstead was constantly in ill health until his death nearly two years after his 1953 heart attack, upon which he was succeeded as governor by Luther H. Hodges. Umstead is buried in the Mount Tabor Church Cemetery in Durham, North Carolina. William B. Umstead State Park in Raleigh, North Carolina was named in his honor in 1966.

It was founded in 1977 by Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Gian Carlo Menotti, who sought to establish a counterpart to the Festival dei Due Mondi (The Festival of Two Worlds) in Spoleto, Italy. When Italian organizers planned an American festival, they searched for a city that would offer the charm of Spoleto, Italy, and also its wealth of theaters, churches, and other performance spaces. Charleston was selected as an ideal location, with Menotti saying of Charleston: :It's intimate, so you can walk from one theatre to the next. It has Old World charm in architecture and gardens. Yet it's a community big enough to support the large number of visitors to the festival. The annual 17-day late-spring event showcases both established and emerging artists in more than 150 performances of opera, dance, theater, classical music, and jazz. History of the Charleston festival=Beginnings The festival experienced financial problems from its outset which produced a quick turnover in leadership. On September 27, 1976, Theodore \\"Ted\\" Stern, the president of the College of Charleston at that time, was named as the new chairman of the Charleston Coordinating Committee after the departure of Hugh Lane. Personality disputes also arose involving Menotti. Menotti, who had served as the artistic director for the festival since its founding, claimed in 1991 that he was not interested in renewing his three-year contract when it ended in 1992 over artistic differences. The board did not officially accept his resignation immediately, but Menotti stood by his intentions, blaming artistic differences with the board and lack of personal control: \\"I no longer feel it is my festival, and this has been my life for 15 years. I feel a bit lonely among them. I'm treated like a clerk.\\" Most significantly, Menotti had a poor relationship with the festival's general manager, Nigel Redden, who challenged programming decisions, expense accounts for Menotti, and administrative decisions by Menotti. Two camps developed on the board, splitting support between those backing Redden and those who supported Menotti (including Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley, Jr.). Mayor Riley supported Menotti so strongly that he threatened to withdraw city support for the festival if Menotti were pushed out. Eventually, in May 1991, Menotti issued an ultimatum that either Redden and his supporters resign or Menotti would. In August 1991, Redden resigned, as did 19 of the 46 board members the next month. The tumult affected the scope of the festival the following year; the budget for 1992's festival was $4.6 million, down about $1 million from 1991, and covering about 20 percent fewer presentations (103 in 1992 compared with over 120 in 1991). In 1990 and 1991, the festival had raised about 44% of its budget (about $2.4 million) from private donations, but in 1992, the festival raised only $1.2 million from such donations, about 33% of its $3.6 million budget that year. By 1993, personal conflicts reached a breaking point, with Menotti and the board of the Charleston festival arguing over those in charge of the festival, its artistic direction, and financing. Menotti, who had threatened the end the festival in Charleston left the festival in 1993; the local board, however, owned the rights to the name of the festival and pledged to continue it without Menotti. Milton Rhodes was appointed the general manager in November 1993, and he immediately set about righting the finances, including negotiating the cancellation of about $400,000 in debt and securing a loan from South Carolina to cover another $600,000 of debt. Still, the financial difficulties continued, and the 1995 festival lost an additional $900,000. In July 1995, Redden was recruited to return to the festival on an interim basis to help it overcome a debt of more than $1,000,000. The 1995 festival went over budget by 20%, and its full-time staff was cut in half. During his first tenure with the festival, Redden had been successful in repairing the festival's flagging finances and left the festival having gone from a $500,000 deficit to a surplus of $1.4 million. Upon his return in 1996, Redden was again successful in turning the finances of the festival around, quickly raising $1.6 million and cutting debt in half. The Festival's mission and programming philosophy Middleton-Motte-Pinckney House at 14 George St., Charleston, South Carolina The Festival‚Äôs mission is to present programs of the highest artistic caliber while maintaining a dedication to young artists, a commitment to all forms of the performing arts, a passion for contemporary innovation, and an enthusiasm for providing unusual performance opportunities for established artists. One of the Festival's tenets is to provide young artists the opportunity to work with veteran directors, designers and performers. World-renowned artists who performed at Spoleto Festival USA early in their careers include Ren√©e Fleming, Emanuel Ax, Joshua Bell, Jean-Yves Thibaudet and Yo-Yo Ma. Each year, the Festival produces its own operas, which are often rarely performed masterpieces by well-known composers or traditional works presented in new ways. It also presents theater, dance and music programs ranging from classical to jazz, bluegrass, soul and blues. Since its inception, the Festival has presented over 200 international and U.S. premieres, notably Creve Coeur by Tennessee Williams and The American Clock by Arthur Miller. Other premieres have included Monkey: Journey to the West by Chen Shi-Zheng, Damon Albarn, and Jamie Hewlett; Peter and Wendy by Lee Breuer; The American Clock by Arthur Miller; The Mechanical Organ by the Nikolais Dance Theatre; Miracolo d‚ÄôAmore by Martha Clarke; Empty Places by Laurie Anderson; Hydrogen Jukebox by Philip Glass and Allen Ginsberg; Praise House by Urban Bush Women; Three Tales by Steve Reich and Beryl Korot; and Tenebrae by Osvaldo Golijov Piccolo Spoleto The official companion festival to Spoleto Festival USA, is operated by the City of Charleston Office of Cultural Affairs. After two years of mini-festivals, Piccolo Spoleto was created as an official part of the overall Spoleto program in 1979. Whereas Spoleto Festival USA features artists and performers of national and international renown, Piccolo Spoleto highlights outstanding local and regional artists with several hundred performances throughout the city. Piccolo Spoleto is \\"the perfect complement to the international scope of its parent festival and its 700 events in 17 days transform Charleston into an exhilarating celebration of performing, literary and visual arts.\\"Piccolo Spoleto Festival website Piccolo Spoleto concludes the day before the main festival with a free concert in Hampton Park. Except for 2001 (when they were held on Daniel Island), the closing ceremonies have been held at Hampton Park since 1984 when the event coincided with the reopening of the refurbished park. Spoleto Festival USA Orchestra Each year members of the Festival Orchestra are selected by nationwide auditions to form the Festival's resident ensemble. The orchestra works with the Resident Conductor and Director of Orchestral Activities, John Kennedy, as well as with guest conductors in opera, symphonic, choral, chamber, and contemporary music performances. Over the years, the Festival Orchestra has proved to be an opportunity for young musicians to gain extensive performance experience. Alumni of the Spoleto orchestra can be found in almost every professional orchestra in the United States and many abroad.

Truman and Gordon Gray. Portrait as governor William Kerr Scott (April 17, 1896April 16, 1958) was an American Democratic Party politician from North Carolina. He was the 62nd Governor of North Carolina from 1949 until 1953 and a United States Senator from 1954 until 1958. A native of Alamance County, North Carolina, and a farmer by training, Scott was a lifelong advocate for agricultural issues and became known in his home state as \\"the Squire of Haw River.\\" He was elected as the state's Commissioner of Agriculture, but resigned that post to run for governor in 1948. His followers, popularly known as \\"Branchhead Boys,\\" fervently supported Scott in all his campaigns and remained a force in North Carolina politics for more than a decade following his death.  Early life  Scott graduated from Hawkins High School in 1913 and subsequently enrolled in the North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, graduating in 1917 with a Bachelor of Science in agriculture. He performed well as a student there, while also running track and volunteering for the Young Men's Christian Association. After graduating he held briefly worked as an emergency food production agent for the United States Department of Agriculture. After the United States entered World War I, he enlisted as a private in the United States Army. For four months he trained with field artillery at Camp Taylor in Kentucky. Shortly before he was due to enroll in officer training school, the war ended and he was discharged from service. Kerr was the only child in his family who had political ambitions. His father advised him that he should acquire land and develop his agricultural enterprise to ensure that when he sought public office he could campaign without fear of losing his job due to political reprisal. Thus, after he was discharged from the army he borrowed $4,000 from his father and bought 224 acres of land. He cleared it and began raising some sheep and cows.  Career  As governor, Scott created the \\"Go Forward\\" program with approval from the state legislature in 1949. He also signed a $200 million rural road building program, leading to nearly 15,000 additional miles of paved road in the state. Immediately following his term as governor, he represented North Carolina in the United States Senate from 1954 and 1958. His son, Bob Scott served as governor from 1969 to 1973, and his granddaughter, Meg Scott Phipps served as North Carolina Commissioner of Agriculture from 2001 to 2003. Relative to other Southern Democrats, Scott was a moderate regarding racial issues during his time as governor. While he supported segregation, he appointed the first black member of the North Carolina Board of Education, Dr. Harold Trigg, and nominated University of North Carolina President Frank Porter Graham to fill a vacant United States Senate seat in 1949. Graham was regarded as one of the most racially and generally progressive figures in the South, and became victimized by pernicious attacks concerning his views on race relations when he campaigned the following year to maintain his senate seat. In an effort to defend Graham, Scott lent the full weight of his political organization to him and assiduously campaigned across North Carolina. Despite intervention from Scott, President Harry Truman, U.S. House Speaker Sam Rayburn, and others, Graham was defeated by conservative lawyer Willis Smith for the Democratic Party's nomination. The tenor of Willis Smith's campaign was considered so offensive that Scott's wife, First Lady Mary Scott, refused to shake the senator-elect's hand at an Executive Mansion reception. Years later, when Scott elected to run for the same U.S. Senate seat which had been contested by Graham, he was queried by a local reporter about how his campaign would respond to the race- baiting strategies that are imputed with the loss of his appointee. To this, he is said to have grinned and replied, \\"I'll handle it, son. I'm not as good a Christian as Frank Porter Graham.\\" Scott attained the Senate seat by approximately 8,000 votes and served until he died of a heart attack in 1958. He was sworn in on November 29, 1954, instead of the following January, as he was filling a vacant seat. In December he voted to censure Senator Joseph McCarthy. As senator, Scott moved away from his previously moderate views on race. He was a signatory of the Southern Manifesto, objecting to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education that state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students are unconstitutional. According to Scott's executive secretary Bill Cochrane, Scott attempted to remove his name from the manifesto before it was read on the floor of the Senate, but it was too late. Reacting directly to the Brown ruling, Kerr expressed his wish that the Supreme Court \\"would reaffirm its own historic decisions approving equal, but separate, school facilities.\\" He added, \\"I have always...been opposed to Negro and white children going to school together.\\" Scott also opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and President Eisenhower's decision to send troops to escort black students to Little Rock Central High School.Pleasants, Julian M. The Political Career of W. Kerr Scott: The Squire From Haw River (University Press of Kentucky; 2014), Chapter 10. Scott died in Burlington, North Carolina on April 16, 1958, and is buried in Hawfields Presbyterian Church Cemetery in Mebane, North Carolina. His son, Robert Scott, was also elected governor in the 1960s. The W. Kerr Scott Dam and Reservoir in Wilkes County, North Carolina are named in honor of the governor. While Senator, he greatly assisted in obtaining approval for construction of the dam and reservoir. In addition, a residence hall is named in his memory on the campus of East Carolina University and a technology building on the campus of Appalachian State University is named for him. His home and farm, the Kerr Scott Farm, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.

Biography Born in York County, South Carolina near Rock Hill, Cherry grew up in Gastonia, North Carolina with relatives after the death of his parents. He earned bachelor's and law degrees at Trinity College (now Duke University). He organized and led a volunteer artillery company during World War I. Cherry served as mayor of Gastonia, as a member and speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives, as chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party (1937‚Äì1940), and as a member of the North Carolina Senate. In Gastonia, it was joked that he was the best lawyer in town when sober, and the second-best lawyer in town when drunk.Tar Heel Laughter By Richard Walser In 1944, Cherry was elected governor as the last in a series of governors affiliated with the political machine of former Gov. O. Max Gardner.Christensen, Rob. The Paradox of Tar Heel Politics. 2008. UNC Press. Gov. Cherry inherited an economy facing material and labor shortages as a result of the ongoing Second World War. One of his primary focuses during his term was the improvement of mental health care at state-run facilities. Cherry Hospital in Goldsboro, North Carolina, is named for him. Unlike most other Southern Democratic governors, Cherry supported Harry S. Truman for re-election in 1948. Cherry retired from politics and returned to the practice of law after his one term as governor (the maximum then allowed by the state constitution).

It inhabits Madrean and Mesoamerican pine-oak forests between . Description Salvia elegans has tubular red flowers and an attractive scent to the leaves that is similar to pineapple. It produces numerous erect leafy stems and flowers in the late autumn. The red flowers are attractive to hummingbirds and butterflies. In a highland temperate forest in central Mexico, pineapple sage was found to be one of the three most-visited species by hummingbirds. It is a short-day plant. The flowering season in Mexico is August onward; further north it may not flower till later autumn, and if there are no frosts, it may flower till spring. Cultivation In cultivation, pineapple sage grows to tall, with the roots extending underground to form a large clump. The pale yellow-green leaves are veined, and covered with fine hairs. Six to twelve scarlet flowers grow in whorls, with a long inflorescence that blooms gradually and over a prolonged period of time. With a hard frost, the plant will die down to the ground and grow back the following spring. Pineapple sage was introduced into horticulture about 1870. The variety \\"Honey Melon\\", which has the same pineapple fragrance in the leaves, blooms early in the summer, rather than in autumn. Phytochemistry The essential oil of S. elegans consists primarily of caffeic acid and its derivatives, such as rosmarinic acid and salvianolic acid, and flavones. Uses The leaves and flowers of S. elegans are edible. The plant is extensively used in Mexican traditional medicine, especially for the treatment of anxiety, and also for lowering of blood pressure. Although scientific information about these medicinal properties is scarce, a preliminary study on mice found support for the plant potentially having antidepressant and antianxiety properties. Pineapple sage has also been shown to have a dose-dependent antihypertensive effect, attributed to its action as an angiotensin II receptor antagonist and inhibitor of the angiotensin converting enzyme.

He was also major general over all North Carolina militia in 1780 and from 1781 to 1783. Early life He was born on August 3, 1729, in Joppa, Maryland, one of the eleven children of Richard Caswell and Christian Dallam Caswell. The younger Richard Caswell departed Maryland for the New Bern area of North Carolina in 1745. He married Mary Mackilwean, the daughter of James and Elinor Mackilwean. They had three children, including a daughter that died at birth in 1753, William Caswell born in 1754, and another daughter born in 1757, who died as an infant. Mary Caswell died from complications of childbirth. The family lived on a plantation home called Red House, which is the site of the Richard Caswell Memorial Park in western Kinston, North Carolina. After Mary's death, Caswell married Sarah Heritage (17401794) on June 20, 1758. Mary was a daughter of William Heritage and Susannah Moore. They had eight children: Richard Caswell born in 1759, Sarah Caswell born in 1762, Winston Caswell born in 1764, Anna Caswell born in 1766, Dallam Caswell born in 1769, John Caswell born in 1772, Susannah Caswell born in 1775, and Christian Caswell born in 1779. While a member of the Province of North Carolina House of Burgesses, a post he held for seventeen years, he introduced a bill in 1762 establishing the town of Kingston, which was changed to Kinston, NC after the Revolutionary War. Regulator Movement As an officer in the local militia, Caswell fought against the Regulators in the Battle of Alamance in 1771 during the War of the Regulation (1760‚Äì1771). According to some sources, he commanded the right wing of Governor William Tryon's forces at Alamance. American Revolutionary War Caswell house in Kinston, North Carolina A lawyer and surveyor by training, Caswell represented North Carolina in the Continental Congress of 1774 and 1775. When the Revolutionary War broke out, Caswell was the commander of the New Bern, NC district Minutemen. As a patriot officer in the American Revolutionary War, Caswell led the New Bern District Minutemen on February 27, 1776 in the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge. Soon there after, the North Carolina Provincial Congress disbanded the minutemen battalions in favor of militia. Caswell was commissioned as the first commander of the New Bern District Brigade of the North Carolina militia when it was formed on May 4, 1776. In 1780 he was commissioned as a major general of all North Carolina militia and state troops. At the Battle of Camden, his troops fled after the Virginia militia broke and fled in a panic, exposing Caswell's militia to attack without greater defense, leaving the Continentals behind to suffer defeat. After the Battle of Camden, Caswell returned home with an unnamed illness. The North Carolina General Assembly appointed William Smallwood of Maryland as his replacement over all North Carolina militia. However, they did not inform General Caswell, so he resigned on October 21, 1780. When Smallwood went back to Maryland in January of 1781, the General Assembly again appointed Caswell as Major General over all North Carolina militia and he retained this position through the end of the war in 1783. Military service record: *Colonel over the New Bern District Minutemen (1775-1776) *Brigadier General over the New Bern District Brigade of militia (1776-1777) *Major General over all North Carolina militia (1780 and 1781-1783) His son, Richard Caswell, Jr., was a colonel and commander of the Dobbs County Regiment and a lieutenant colonel in the 2nd North Carolina Regiment during the American Revolution. He was lost at sea in 1784. His son by his first marriage, William was colonel over the Dobbs County Regiment and brigadier general over the New Bern District Brigade during the American Revolution. Governor of North Carolina Caswell was president of the provincial congress that wrote the first Constitution of North Carolina in 1776. As the congress adjourned, it elected Caswell as acting governor. He took the oath of office on January 16, 1777. Under the new constitution, the state Legislature (\\"General Assembly\\") re-elected him as the first Governor in April 1777. He stepped down in 1780, as the constitution allowed only three consecutive one-year terms. He then assumed command of all of North Carolina's militia, which he commanded at the American defeat at the Battle of Camden, August 16, 1780. Later career and death He served as the state's comptroller and as a member of the North Carolina Senate between his two gubernatorial terms. Caswell was also chosen to be one of North Carolina's delegates to the United States Constitutional Convention of 1787, but he did not attend. Caswell was a prosperous farmer, land speculator, tanner, and Grand Master Mason of North Carolina.Francois X. Martin \\"A Funeral Oration of the Most Worshipful and Honorable Major-General Richard Caswell\\" (1791). Freemason's Magazine, Or General and Complete Library, Volume 5. He had training in surveying and was appointed deputy surveyor for the colony in 1750. At the time of his death in 1789, he had returned once again to the North Carolina General Assembly, this time serving as Speaker of the Senate. Caswell died in Fayetteville, North Carolina, on November 10, 1789. According to tradition, his body was returned to Kinston for burial in the family cemetery, near where a memorial and museum stands today. Legacy Among his many accomplishments was his proposal to use the reimbursement funds for aid rendered to the Crown during the French and Indian war for erecting and establishing a free school in every county in North Carolina. His \\"Address to the General Assembly\\" in 1760 on this topic was used for many years by other politicians in favor of public education, and he also wrote the proposal into the first state constitution in 1776.Holloman, Charles R. 1979.Caswell, Richard.

It is the result of reinvesting interest, rather than paying it out, so that interest in the next period is then earned on the principal sum plus previously accumulated interest. Compound interest is standard in finance and economics. Compound interest is contrasted with simple interest, where previously accumulated interest is not added to the principal amount of the current period, so there is no compounding. The simple annual interest rate is the interest amount per period, multiplied by the number of periods per year. The simple annual interest rate is also known as the nominal interest rate (not to be confused with the interest rate not adjusted for inflation, which goes by the same name). Compounding frequency The compounding frequency is the number of times per year (or rarely, another unit of time) the accumulated interest is paid out, or capitalized (credited to the account), on a regular basis. The frequency could be yearly, half-yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily, or continuously (or not at all, until maturity). For example, monthly capitalization with interest expressed as an annual rate means that the compounding frequency is 12, with time periods measured in months. The effect of compounding depends on: # The nominal interest rate which is applied and # The frequency interest is compounded. Annual equivalent rate The nominal rate cannot be directly compared between loans with different compounding frequencies. Both the nominal interest rate and the compounding frequency are required in order to compare interest-bearing financial instruments. To help consumers compare retail financial products more fairly and easily, many countries require financial institutions to disclose the annual compound interest rate on deposits or advances on a comparable basis. The interest rate on an annual equivalent basis may be referred to variously in different markets as effective annual percentage rate (EAPR), annual equivalent rate (AER), effective interest rate, effective annual rate, annual percentage yield and other terms. The effective annual rate is the total accumulated interest that would be payable up to the end of one year, divided by the principal sum. There are usually two aspects to the rules defining these rates: #The rate is the annualised compound interest rate, and #There may be charges other than interest. The effect of fees or taxes which the customer is charged, and which are directly related to the product, may be included. Exactly which fees and taxes are included or excluded varies by country, may or may not be comparable between different jurisdictions, because the use of such terms may be inconsistent, and vary according to local practice. Examples * 1,000 Brazilian real (BRL) is deposited into a Brazilian savings account paying 20% per annum, compounded annually. At the end of one year, 1,000 x 20% = 200 BRL interest is credited to the account. The account then earns 1,200 x 20% = 240 BRL in the second year. * A rate of 1% per month is equivalent to a simple annual interest rate (nominal rate) of 12%, but allowing for the effect of compounding, the annual equivalent compound rate is 12.68% per annum (1.0112 ‚àí 1). * The interest on corporate bonds and government bonds is usually payable twice yearly. The amount of interest paid (each six months) is the disclosed interest rate divided by two and multiplied by the principal. The yearly compounded rate is higher than the disclosed rate. * Canadian mortgage loans are generally compounded semi-annually with monthly (or more frequent) payments.http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/I-15/bo-ga:s_6//en#anchorbo- ga:s_6 Interest Act (Canada), Department of Justice. The Interest Act specifies that interest is not recoverable unless the mortgage loan contains a statement showing the rate of interest chargeable, \\"calculated yearly or half- yearly, not in advance.\\" In practice, banks use the half-yearly rate. * U.S. mortgages use an amortizing loan, not compound interest. With these loans, an amortization schedule is used to determine how to apply payments toward principal and interest. Interest generated on these loans is not added to the principal, but rather is paid off monthly as the payments are applied. * It is sometimes mathematically simpler, for example, in the valuation of derivatives, to use continuous compounding, which is the limit as the compounding period approaches zero. Continuous compounding in pricing these instruments is a natural consequence of It≈ç calculus, where financial derivatives are valued at ever increasing frequency, until the limit is approached and the derivative is valued in continuous time. Discount instruments * US and Canadian T-Bills (short term Government debt) have a different convention. Their interest is calculated on a discount basis as (100 ‚àí P)/Pbnm, where P is the price paid. Instead of normalizing it to a year, the interest is prorated by the number of days t: (365/t)√ó100. (See day count convention). Calculation=Periodic compounding The total accumulated value, including the principal sum P plus compounded interest I, is given by the formula: :P' = P \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{r}{n}\\\\right)^{nt} where: :P is the original principal sum :P' is the new principal sum :r is the nominal annual interest rate :n is the compounding frequency :t is the overall length of time the interest is applied (expressed using the same time units as r, usually years). The total compound interest generated is the final value minus the initial principal: :I = P \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{r}{n}\\\\right)^{nt} - P =Example 1= Suppose a principal amount of $1,500 is deposited in a bank paying an annual interest rate of 4.3%, compounded quarterly. Then the balance after 6 years is found by using the formula above, with P = 1500, r = 0.043 (4.3%), n = 4, and t = 6: :P' =1\\\\,500\\\\times \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{0.043}{4}\\\\right)^{4 \\\\times 6}\\\\approx 1\\\\,938.84 So the new principal P' after 6 years is approximately $1,938.84. Subtracting the original principal from this amount gives the amount of interest received: :1\\\\,938.84 - 1\\\\,500 = 438.84 =Example 2= Suppose the same amount of $1,500 is compounded biennially (every 2 years). (This is very unusual in practice.) Then the balance after 6 years is found by using the formula above, with P = 1500, r = 0.043 (4.3%), n = 1/2 (the interest is compounded every two years), and t = 6 : :P' = 1\\\\,500\\\\times \\\\left(1 + (0.043\\\\times 2)\\\\right)^{\\\\frac 6 2}\\\\approx 1\\\\,921.24 So, the balance after 6 years is approximately $1,921.24. The amount of interest received can be calculated by subtracting the principal from this amount. :1\\\\,921.24 - 1\\\\,500 = 421.24 The interest is less compared with the previous case, as a result of the lower compounding frequency. Accumulation function Since the principal P is simply a coefficient, it is often dropped for simplicity, and the resulting accumulation function is used instead. The accumulation function shows what $1 grows to after any length of time. Accumulation functions for simple and compound interest are :a(t)=1+t r\\\\, :a(t) = \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac {r} {n}\\\\right) ^ {nt} Continuous compounding As n, the number of compounding periods per year, increases without limit, the case is known as continuous compounding, in which case the effective annual rate approaches an upper limit of , where is a mathematical constant that is the base of the natural logarithm. Continuous compounding can be thought of as making the compounding period infinitesimally small, achieved by taking the limit as n goes to infinity. See definitions of the exponential function for the mathematical proof of this limit. The amount after t periods of continuous compounding can be expressed in terms of the initial amount P0 as :P(t)=P_0 e ^ {rt}. Force of interest As the number of compounding periods n reaches infinity in continuous compounding, the continuous compound interest rate is referred to as the force of interest \\\\delta. In mathematics, the accumulation functions are often expressed in terms of e, the base of the natural logarithm. This facilitates the use of calculus to manipulate interest formulae. For any continuously differentiable accumulation function a(t), the force of interest, or more generally the logarithmic or continuously compounded return is a function of time defined as follows: :\\\\delta_{t}=\\\\frac{a'(t)}{a(t)}=\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\ln a(t) This is the logarithmic derivative of the accumulation function. Conversely: :a(t)=e^{\\\\int_0^t \\\\delta_s\\\\, ds}\\\\ , (since a(0) = 1; this can be viewed as a particular case of a product integral). When the above formula is written in differential equation format, then the force of interest is simply the coefficient of amount of change: :da(t)=\\\\delta_{t}a(t)\\\\,dt\\\\, For compound interest with a constant annual interest rate r, the force of interest is a constant, and the accumulation function of compounding interest in terms of force of interest is a simple power of e: :\\\\delta=\\\\ln(1+r)\\\\, or :a(t)=e^{t\\\\delta}\\\\, The force of interest is less than the annual effective interest rate, but more than the annual effective discount rate. It is the reciprocal of the e-folding time. See also notation of interest rates. A way of modeling the force of inflation is with Stoodley's formula: \\\\delta_t = p + {s \\\\over {1+rse^{st}}} where p, r and s are estimated. Compounding basis To convert an interest rate from one compounding basis to another compounding basis, use :r_2=\\\\left[\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{r_1}{n_1}\\\\right)^\\\\frac{n_1}{n_2}-1\\\\right]{n_2}, where r1 is the interest rate with compounding frequency n1, and r2 is the interest rate with compounding frequency n2. When interest is continuously compounded, use :\\\\delta=n\\\\ln{\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{r}{n}\\\\right)}, where \\\\delta is the interest rate on a continuous compounding basis, and r is the stated interest rate with a compounding frequency n. Monthly amortized loan or mortgage payments The interest on loans and mortgages that are amortized‚Äîthat is, have a smooth monthly payment until the loan has been paid off‚Äîis often compounded monthly. The formula for payments is found from the following argument. =Exact formula for monthly payment= An exact formula for the monthly payment (c) is : c= \\\\frac{Pr}{1-\\\\frac{1}{(1+r)^n}} or equivalently : c= \\\\frac{Pr}{1-e^{-n\\\\ln(1+r)}} where: : c = monthly payment : P = principal : r = monthly interest rate : n = number of payment periods This can be derived by considering how much is left to be repaid after each month. The Principal remaining after the first month is : P_1=(1+r)P - c, that is, the initial amount plus interest less the payment. If the whole loan is repaid after one month then :P_1=0, so P=\\\\frac{c}{1+r} After the second month P_2=(1+r) P_1 - c is left, so :P_2=(1+r)((1+r)P-c)-c If the whole loan was repaid after two months, :P_2=0, so P = \\\\frac{c}{1+r}+\\\\frac{c}{(1+r)^2} This equation generalises for a term of n months, P = c \\\\sum_{j=1}^n \\\\frac{1}{(1+r)^j} . This is a geometric series which has the sum :P=\\\\frac{c}{r}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{(1+r)^n}\\\\right) which can be rearranged to give : c= \\\\frac{Pr}{1-\\\\frac{1}{(1+r)^n}}=\\\\frac{Pr}{1-e^{-n\\\\ln(1+r)}} ;Spreadsheet formula In spreadsheets, the PMT() function is used. The syntax is: :PMT( interest_rate, number_payments, present_value, future_value,[Type] ) See Excel, Mac Numbers, LibreOffice, Open Office, Google Sheets for more details. For example, for interest rate of 6% (0.06/12), 25 years * 12 p.a., PV of $150,000, FV of 0, type of 0 gives: := PMT(0.06/12, 25 * 12, -150000, 0, 0) := $966.45 =Approximate formula for monthly payment= A formula that is accurate to within a few percent can be found by noting that for typical U.S. note rates (I<8\\\\% and terms T=10‚Äì30 years), the monthly note rate is small compared to 1: r<<1 so that the \\\\ln(1+r)\\\\approx r which yields a simplification so that :c\\\\approx \\\\frac{Pr}{1-e^{-nr}}= \\\\frac{P}{n}\\\\frac{nr}{1-e^{-nr}} which suggests defining auxiliary variables :Y\\\\equiv n r = IT :c_0\\\\equiv \\\\frac{P}{n} . Here c_0 is the monthly payment required for a zero‚Äìinterest loan paid off in n installments. In terms of these variables the approximation can be written :c\\\\approx c_0 \\\\frac{Y}{1-e^{-Y}}, The function f(Y)\\\\equiv \\\\frac{Y}{1-e^{-Y}}-\\\\frac{Y}{2} is even: :f(Y)=f(-Y) implying that it can be expanded in even powers of Y. It follows immediately that \\\\frac{Y}{1-e^{-Y}} can be expanded in even powers of Y plus the single term: Y/2 . It will prove convenient then to define :X=\\\\frac{1}{2}Y = \\\\frac{1}{2}IT so that :c\\\\approx c_0 \\\\frac{2X}{1-e^{-2X}} which can be expanded: : c\\\\approx c_0 \\\\left(1 + X + \\\\frac{X^2}{3} - \\\\frac{1}{45} X^4 + ...\\\\right) where the ellipses indicate terms that are higher order in even powers of X. The expansion : P\\\\approx P_0 \\\\left(1 + X + \\\\frac{X^2}{3}\\\\right) is valid to better than 1% provided X\\\\le 1 . =Example of mortgage payment= For a $10,000 mortgage with a term of 30 years and a note rate of 4.5%, payable yearly, we find: :T=30 :I=0.045 which gives :X=\\\\frac{1}{2}IT=.675 so that : P\\\\approx P_0 \\\\left(1 + X + \\\\frac{1}{3}X^2 \\\\right)=\\\\$333.33 (1+.675+.675^2/3)=\\\\$608.96 The exact payment amount is P=\\\\$608.02 so the approximation is an overestimate of about a sixth of a percent. Investing: monthly deposits Given an principal (initial) deposit and a recurring deposit, the total return of an investment can be calculated via the compound interest gained per unit of time. If required, the interest on additional non-recurring and recurring deposits can also be defined within the same formula (see below).https://www.wavesofpaper.com/finance/Using-Compound-Interest-to- Optimize-Investment-Spread : P = Principal deposit : r = Rate of return (monthly) : M = Monthly deposit, and : t = Time, in months :M\\\\frac{(1+r)^t-1}{r}+P(1+r)^t If two or more types of deposits occur (either recurring or non-recurring), the compound interest earned can be represented as :M\\\\frac{(r+1)^t-1}{r}+P(r+1)^t+k\\\\frac{(r+1)^{t-x}-1}{r}+C(r+1)^{t-y} :where C and k are non-recurring and recurring deposits, respectively, and x and y are the differences in time between a new deposit and whichever variable t is modeling. History Compound interest was once regarded as the worst kind of usury and was severely condemned by Roman law and the common laws of many other countries. The Florentine merchant Francesco Balducci Pegolotti provided a table of compound interest in his book Pratica della mercatura of about 1340. It gives the interest on 100 lire, for rates from 1% to 8%, for up to 20 years. The Summa de arithmetica of Luca Pacioli (1494) gives the Rule of 72, stating that to find the number of years for an investment at compound interest to double, one should divide the interest rate into 72. Richard Witt's book Arithmeticall Questions, published in 1613, was a landmark in the history of compound interest. It was wholly devoted to the subject (previously called anatocism), whereas previous writers had usually treated compound interest briefly in just one chapter in a mathematical textbook. Witt's book gave tables based on 10% (the then maximum rate of interest allowable on loans) and on other rates for different purposes, such as the valuation of property leases. Witt was a London mathematical practitioner and his book is notable for its clarity of expression, depth of insight and accuracy of calculation, with 124 worked examples. Jacob Bernoulli discovered the constant e in 1683 by studying a question about compound interest. In the 19th century, and possibly earlier, Persian merchants used a slightly modified linear Taylor approximation to the monthly payment formula that could be computed easily in their heads.

The assembly appointed Richard Caswell as commander-in-chief (Major General) of the North Carolina militia and State troops, even though the constitution assigned this responsibility to the governor. Then in December 1780 they named a Council Extraordinary that further encroached on his office. Consequently, Nash resigned and went home in the spring of 1781. Thomas Burke was named to replace him. Death Later in 1782, North Carolina eased political tensions by sending Nash as a delegate to the Continental Congress. He would serve there the rest of his life, as he died at a session in New York City. Abner was originally buried in St. Paul's Churchyard in Manhattan, but his body was later returned for burial in a private, family plot in Craven County, North Carolina. Family His son, Frederick Nash, was also a lawyer and political leader. He would serve as Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court. Another descendant, also named Frederick, would later become a famous poet, going by his middle name, Ogden Nash.

The revolt, a major precursor to the Greek War of Independence (which erupted in 1821), was part of Catherine the Great's so-called \\"Greek Plan\\" and was eventually suppressed by the Ottomans. Background The Ottoman Empire had its longest period of peace between 1739 (Treaty of Belgrade) and 1768 - three decades when it did not engage any of its European rivals. Europe was caught up in costly and bloody conflicts while the Ottomans stayed out and tended to economy and politics, and rebuilding social and administrative organization. This peaceful period came to an end on 23 October 1768, when the Porte declared war on Russia. Causes included aggressive Russian foreign policy, Russian interference in Crimea (an Ottoman vassal), and the power struggle in Poland- Lithuania. There were insignificant events in 1768‚Äì69, as both sides prepared for a long campaign. Meanwhile, Greek rebels were readied. Wishing to weaken the Ottoman Empire and establish a pro-Russian independent Greek state, Russian emissaries had been sent to Mani in the mid-1760s to make a pact with the strongest local military leaders, and at the same time notable Greeks approached various Russian agents, discussing plans for the liberation of Greece. In preparation for war, Russian agents promoted Greek rebellion to support military actions in the north. Russian artillery captain Grigorios Papadopoulos (or Georgios Papasoglu), a Greek, was dispatched to Mani. Georgios Papazolis, another Greek officer of the Russian army, cooperated with the brothers Grigory and Alexei Orlov in preparations for a Greek insurrection in the Morea during the Russian military operations against the Ottoman Empire in 1769. The organization of the Greek rebellion was put under brothers Orlov, with Alexei as the Russian fleet commander. Some Greek notables joined the Russian side, and promised them men and supplies, while in return they expected massive Russian aid (10,000 soldiers and military equipment). Russia planned to incite Orthodox Christians to revolt, and sent agents to Bosnia, Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, Crete and the Morea. Another Orlov brother, , was sent to coordinate rebels in Morea, deemed the most important strategic area in mainland Greece (due to its ports). Russia assembled a war fleet for deployment in the Mediterranean, described as \\"one of the most spectacular events of the 18th century\\", which caught the Ottomans off-guard. The first fleet contingent (out of two) departed in August 1769 and arrived in the Aegean in December. This expedition of four ships, a few hundred soldiers and inadequate arms supplies greatly disappointed the Greeks. Nevertheless, combined Russian-Greek forces attempted a campaign. Progress of the revolt Among the Greek leaders that were approached were Panagiotis Benakis, a notable from Kalamata, the local metropolitan bishop Anthimos, and Cretan shipping magnate John Vlachos \\"Daskalogiannis\\". The arrival of the Russian fleet in Mani in February 1770 saw the establishment of local armed groups in Mani and Kalamata. However, the small Russian expeditionary force could not convince a part of the local Greeks to take arms. The Russian manpower was much fewer than expected and mutual distrust developed between the Greek and Russian leaders. Initially an army of 1,400 men was formed, but additional reinforcement of Cretans arrived the following days. The Greek forces were divided into major units (called legions) with the help of a small number of Russian officers and soldiers. The \\"Eastern Spartan Legion\\" in Laconia, with 1,200 men, was organized by P. P. Dolgorukov and led by Georgios \\"Yiorgakis\\" Mavromichalis, while the \\"Western Spartan Legion\\" in Messenia was led by G. M. Barkov and Antonios Psarros. The Greek rebels were initially successful and managed to defeat Ottoman forces in Laconia and eastern Messenia in southern Morea. The revolt however failed to effectively spread, thus the fortresses of Navarino, Methone and the administrative center of Morea, Tripolitsa (modern Tripoli), remained in Ottoman hands. The rebels did manage to control the fortress of Mystras, where they set up a local government. Meanwhile, the Greek revolt in Crete was led by Daskalogiannis. Soon after Sfakians refused to pay taxes and revolted in great numbers. However, the support promised by the Russian emissaries never arrived at Crete and Daskalogiannis was left to his own devices. He managed to organize a band of 2,000 well armed men who descended from the mountains onto the plains of western Crete. They attacked and killed local Turks in an unsuccessful effort to convince other Cretans to join them in their quest to overthrow the Ottomans. The Cretan uprising was soon suppressed by numerically superior Ottoman units. In April the revolutionaries managed to capture the fortress of Navarino however the uprising was already doomed and the Russian fleet abandoned the region in following June. As soon as the first news of the Russian-backed Greek revolt reached the Ottoman capital, the first anti-Greek pogroms broke out in various cities of the Ottoman Empire, including Smyrna. With the assistance of Greek islanders, the Russian fleet was able to score a major victory against the Ottoman Navy in the Battle of Cesme, but this did not help the Greek army in Morea. As the Russians failed to bring the forces they promised, the revolt was soon crushed. Greek reinforcements from Macedonia and Olympus region faced opposition in their descent to Morea and thus were unable to assist the revolutionaries. Hard-pressed by the arising necessity to fight a major war with Russia on its northern borders, the Ottoman Empire hired Albanian mercenary troops and they defeated the Russo-Greek expedition at Tripolitsa. Aftermath The Muslim Albanian mercenaries hired by the Ottomans remained in the Peloponnese for several years after the suppression of the revolt, periodically launching reprisals against the Greeks, thus taking frightful revenge for the Christian forces that had massacred Muslim civilians and destroyed property during the uprising. Referred to by the local Greek populace as \\"Turk-Albanians\\", those forces had also destroyed many cities and towns in Epirus during 1769‚Äì70. In Patras nearly no one was left alive after the Turkish-Albanian invasion. The city of Mystras was left in ruins and the metropolitan bishop Ananias was executed despite having saved the life of several Turks during the uprising. A great number of local Greeks was killed by the Albanian groups, while several children were sold to slavery. The Ottoman government was unable to pay the wages the Albanian mercenaries demanded for their service, causing the latter to ravage the region. In 1774 the Russo-Turkish War ended with the Treaty of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca which granted general amnesty to the population. Nevertheless attacks by Muslim Albanian mercenaries in the region continued not only against the Greek population but also against Turks. The extensive destruction and lack of control in the Peloponnese forced the central Ottoman government to send a regular Turkish military force to suppress those Albanian troops in 1779, and eventually drive them out from Peloponnese. From the Russian point of view, Count Orlov's mission was a success, damaging the Turkish fleet, directing Turkish troops south, and contributing to the victory that led to the signing of the Treaty of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca. From the Greek point of view, the revolt was a failure which cost a huge number of lives (both in battle, and in the Turkish reprisals that followed). The Greeks were effectively forgotten in the Treaty of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca, and they became increasingly distrustful of the Russians as a result. However, Greek ships gained the right to sail under Russian flag and Russia the right to protect the Orthodox population in the Ottoman empire. While Greek connections to Russia remained strong (in part because of the influence of prominent Greeks in Russia such as Count Demetrio Mocenigo of Zante that served as Russian Ambassador in Tuscany), many among the next generation of Greek leaders (such as Alexandros Mavrokordatos) would look also to Britain and France for support. In popular culture The revolt was a crucial event for the further development of Philhellenism as an important literary movement in the Western world. As such, the protagonist in Friedrich H√∂lderlin's novel Hyperion participates in a 1770 revolt inspired by the Orlov Revolt.

It may be sold as a pasteurized, refrigerated product; or as an ultra-high-temperature (UHT) treated product not requiring refrigeration. It may also be made in restaurants or homes by mixing flavorings into milk. In New England, milk blended with flavored syrups such as chocolate or strawberry in a milkshake machine, is commonly called a \\"milkshake\\"; in other parts of the country, a milkshake always includes ice cream or thickeners. Types Flavored milk, either cow, soy, almond, or camel, contains sugar, colorings, and (mostly inexpensive artificial) flavorings (one prominent example being the artificial strawberry flavor, ethyl methylphenylglycidate). These flavorings can be sold as a powder to be added to plain milk, or bought pre-mixed alongside other milk products. Flavoring can be included in a straw, and some flavored milk products are designed as dietary supplements by including additional vitamins or minerals. Bottled spiced (masala) milk is a popular beverage in the Indian subcontinent. Other companies provide flavored beverages in the United Kingdom, which sells packaged beverages to the mobile vendor market. Australia has the highest consumption rate of flavored milk in the world, standing at 9.5 liters per capita in 2004.http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/02/11/1076388435970.html theage.com.au Over the years, Kemps, a Midwestern milk company, has put various flavors of milk on the market, including their \\"Monkey Business\\" milk which is banana flavored. Contrary to popular belief, the milk does not contain any real bananas in it. Flavored milk is particularly popular in the Australian states of South Australia and Western Australia. A 2013 Sunday Times article reported Western Australia was the \\"flavoured milk capital of Australia\\", with a A$220-million industry, average consumption of per person, and more than 40 varieties of iced coffee alone available.Sonia Kohlbacher (9 November 2013). \\"WA in a flavoured milk war\\" ‚Äì PerthNow.

According to Coca-Cola Amatil, one of the largest bottlers in the Asia-Pacific region, South Australia is the only place where sales of flavored milk outstrip those of cola.(24 June 2008). \\"Coke hopes things go better with - milk\\" ‚Äì The Advertiser. Accessed 27 January 2015. Controversy and criticism Jamie Oliver, host of Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution, brought attention in the United States to public schools that serve flavored milk in the school cafeterias. Flavored milk advocates claim that many children will avoid the nutrition found in milk unless it has been flavored, with the benefits of milk outweighing a few teaspoons of sugar. Opponents say that with rising levels of obesity and heart disease, flavored milk should be removed from schools and children should be taught to drink plain milk. A 2018 analysis of more than 90 popular chilled flavoured dairy milks revealed that a carton of flavoured milk can contain as much sugar as a can of soft drink, with many of the bestselling brands containing more than a day‚Äôs worth of added sugar in a single serving.

The Order soon spread to France, Germany and Spain, and continues to exist today. Like the other mendicant orders, there are three separate components, or orders, of the movement: the friars, contemplative nuns and a Third Order of laypeople who live in the spirit of the Order in their daily lives. At present there are only two fraternities of the Minim tertiaries; both are in Italy. History The founder of the Order, Saint Francis of Paola, was born in 1416 and named in honor of St. Francis of Assisi. The boy became ill when he was only one month old, and his mother prayed to St. Francis and promised that her son would spend a year in a Franciscan friary if he were healed. Her prayer was granted, and at 13 years of age Francis fulfilled that votive year. After this year he dedicated himself to a life of solitude and penance as a hermit.A.M. Galuzzi, Dizionario degli istituti di perfezione, vol. IV (1977), col. 528. In 1435, two followers joined Francis and began the community, which was first called the \\"Poor Hermits of St. Francis of Assisi.\\" Francis and his followers founded hermitages at Paterno in 1444 and Milazzo, Sicily, in 1469. The Archbishop of Cosenza approved the group and established them as a religious order on November 30, 1470, and this approval was confirmed by Pope Sixtus IV in his bull Sedes Apostolica of May 17, 1474. At that time, the pope also changed their status from that of hermits to mendicant friars.A.M. Galuzzi, Dizionario degli istituti di perfezione, vol. V (1978), col. 1356. Marin Mersenne (1588‚Äì1648) The name Minims comes from the Italian word minimo, meaning the smallest or the least, and their founder would call himself il minimo dei minimi. Francis of Paola wanted to distinguish himself as being of even less significance than the Friars Minor founded by his patron saint. Francis composed a rule for the community in 1493, which was approved under the name of \\"Hermits of the Order of the Minims\\".A.M. Galuzzi, Dizionario degli istituti di perfezione, vol. V (1978), col. 1358. The definitive version of the rule was solemnly approved by Pope Julius II in the Bull Inter ceteros, July 28, 1506, who also simplified the name of the community to the Order of Minims ().A.M. Galuzzi, Dizionario degli istituti di perfezione, vol. V (1978), col. 1359. In addition to the standard three religious vows of chastity, poverty and obedience, the rule contains the vow of \\"a Lenten way of life\\" (), which is considered to be the distinctive feature of the Minims.Currier, Charles Warren. History of religious orders, Murphy, 1898 This vow is for perpetual abstinence from all meat and dairy products, veganism, except in case of grave illness and by order of a physician. Because of asceticism, The Order is also discalced in character and there are other acts of humility. The Minim habit consists of a black wool tunic, with broad sleeves, a hood, and a short scapular. It has a thick, black cord (with four knots that signify the four vows) with a tassel to gird the robe. The Order of the Minims spread throughout Italy in the fifteenth century and was introduced to France in 1482, and later to Spain and to Germany in 1497.Oliger, Livarius. \\"Minimi.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 27 April 2015 The houses in Spain, Germany, and France were suppressed during the period following the French Revolution. By the turn of the 20th century, only 19 friaries remained, all but one of them in Italy. On December 31, 2010, the Order had 46 communities with 174 members, 112 of them priests.Annuario Pontificio 2012, Vatican (2011), p. 1427. The majority of these were in Italy, but they are also established in Cameroon, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Czech Republic, India, Mexico, Ukraine and the United States of America.Website of the Order (in Italian) Paulaner brewery The Munich friary of the German Minims brewed beer as means of support, but after the friars were expelled, the brewery continued independently.

While he was there, the Spanish ambassador, Don Pedro de Lucena, who was a very pious man, grew to know and admire him. He sent reports of the holy friar to his family back in Ja√©n. His daughter, Elena, and her two daughters, Maria and Francisca, felt so inspired by Don Pedro's reports, they wanted to dedicate themselves to the way of life Francis had established. Through the ambassador, they communicated their interest to the saint, and asked for a rule of life which they might follow. St. Francis welcomed their request heartily, and, to this end, he adapted the rule of the friars for them to live as cloistered nuns. Don Pedro donated a portion of his estate to the young women, and there they formed a small monastic community. They received the Minim religious habit from a Friar Lionet on June 11, 1495, and established the Monastery of Jesus and Mary. This was first and remains the oldest monastery of the Minim nuns. Francisca was elected as the first corrector (religious superior) of the community. She spent many years as the corrector of the monastery, gaining a reputation for holiness, and is today honored as Blessed Francisca. Their proper rule was approved by the Holy See in 1506, at the same time as that of the friars.Website of the Monastery of Jesus and Mary in Ja√©n, Spain (in Spanish) The Federation of Minim Nuns of Saint Francis of Paola includes 14 monasteries in Spain, Italy, Mexico, and the Philippines.Federacj√≥n de Monjas Minims Notable Minim Nuns A new community was established in Barcelona on Easter 1623.

The book was in response to allegations that Christianity brought about the decline of Rome and is considered one of Augustine's most important works, standing alongside The Confessions, The Enchiridion, On Christian Doctrine, and On the Trinity. As a work of one of the most influential Church Fathers, The City of God is a cornerstone of Western thought, expounding on many profound questions of theology, such as the suffering of the righteous, the existence of evil, the conflict between free will and divine omniscience, and the doctrine of original sin. Background The sack of Rome by the Visigoths in 410 left Romans in a deep state of shock, and many Romans saw it as punishment for abandoning traditional Roman religion for Christianity. In response to these accusations, and in order to console Christians, Augustine wrote The City of God as an argument for the truth of Christianity over competing religions and philosophies. He argues that Christianity was not responsible for the Sack of Rome, but instead responsible for its success. Even if the earthly rule of the Empire was imperiled, it was the City of God that would ultimately triumph. Augustine's focus was Heaven, a theme of many Christian works of Late Antiquity. Despite Christianity's designation as the official religion of the Empire, Augustine declared its message to be spiritual rather than political. Christianity, he argued, should be concerned with the mystical, heavenly city, the New Jerusalem, rather than with earthly politics. The book presents human history as a conflict between what Augustine calls the Earthly City (often colloquially referred to as the City of Man, but never by Augustine) and the City of God, a conflict that is destined to end in victory for the latter. The City of God is marked by people who forego earthly pleasure to dedicate themselves to the eternal truths of God, now revealed fully in the Christian faith. The Earthly City, on the other hand, consists of people who have immersed themselves in the cares and pleasures of the present, passing world. Augustine‚Äôs thesis depicts the history of the world as universal warfare between God and the Devil. This metaphysical war is not limited by time but only by geography on Earth. In this war, God moves (by divine intervention, Providence) those governments, political/ideological movements and military forces aligned (or aligned the most) with the Catholic Church (the City of God) in order to oppose by all means‚Äîincluding military‚Äîthose governments, political/ideological movements and military forces aligned (or aligned the most) with the Devil (the City of the World). This concept of world history guided by Divine Providence in a universal war between God and the Devil is part of the official doctrine of the Catholic Church as most recently stated in the Second Vatican Council's Gaudium et Spes document: \\"The Church ... holds that in her most benign Lord and Master can be found the key, the focal point and the goal of man, as well as of all human history ... all of human life, whether individual or collective, shows itself to be a dramatic struggle between good and evil, between light and darkness ... The Lord is the goal of human history the focal point of the longings of history and of civilization, the center of the human race, the joy of every heart and the answer to all its yearnings.\\" Woodcut depicting Augustine writing The City of God Structure * Part I (Books I‚ÄìX): a polemical critique of Roman religion and philosophy, corresponding to the Earthly City ** Book I‚ÄìV: A critique of pagan religion *** Book I: a criticism of the pagans who attribute the sack of Rome to Christianity despite being saved by taking refuge in Christian churches. The book also explains good and bad things happen to righteous and wicked people alike, and it consoles the women violated in the recent calamity. *** Book II: a proof that because of the worship of the pagan gods, Rome suffered the greatest calamity of all, that is, moral corruption. *** Book III: a proof that the pagan gods failed to save Rome numerous times in the past from worldly disasters, such as the sack of Rome by the Gauls. *** Book IV: a proof that the power and long duration of the Roman empire was due not to the pagan gods but to the Christian God. *** Book V: a refutation of the doctrine of fate and an explanation of the Christian doctrine of free will and its consistency with God's omniscience. The book proves that Rome's dominion was due to the virtue of the Romans and explains the true happiness of the Christian emperors. ** Book VI‚ÄìX: A critique of pagan philosophy *** Book VI: a refutation of the assertion that the pagan gods are to be worshipped for eternal life (rather than temporal benefits). Augustine claimed that even the esteemed pagan theologist Varro held the gods in contempt. *** Book VII: a demonstration that eternal life is not granted by Janus, Jupiter, Saturn, and other select gods. *** Book VIII: an argument against the Platonists and their natural theology, which Augustine views as the closest approximation of Christian truth, and a refutation of Apuleius' insistence of the worship of demons as mediators between God and man. *** Book IX: a proof that all demons are evil and that only Christ can provide man with eternal happiness. *** Book X: a teaching that the good angels wish that God alone is worshipped and a proof that no sacrifice can lead to purification except that of Christ. * Part II (Books XI‚ÄìXXII): discussion on the City of God and its relationship to the Earthly City ** Books XI‚ÄìXIV: the origins of the two cities *** Book XI: the origins of the two cities from the separation of the good and bad angels, and a detailed analysis of Genesis 1. *** Book XII: answers to why some angels are good and others bad, and a close examination of the creation of man. *** Book XIII: teaching that death originated as a penalty for Adam's sin. *** Book XIV: teachings on the original sin as the cause for future lust and shame as a just punishment for lust. ** Books XV‚ÄìXVIII: the history or progress of the two cities, including foundational theological principles about Jews. *** Book XV: an analysis of the events in Genesis between the time of Cain and Abel to the time of the flood. *** Book XVI: the progress of the two cities from Noah to Abraham, and the progress of the heavenly city from Abraham to the kings of Israel. *** Book XVII: the history of the city of God from Samuel to David and to Christ, and Christological interpretations of the prophecies in Kings and Psalms. *** Book XVIII: the parallel history of the earthly and heavenly cities from Abraham to the end. Doctrine of Witness, that Jews received prophecy predicting Jesus, and that Jews are dispersed among the nations to provide independent testimony of the Hebrew Scriptures. ** Books XIX‚ÄìXXII: the deserved destinies of the two cities. *** Book XIX: the end of the two cities, and the happiness of the people of Christ. *** Book XX: the prophecies of the Last Judgment in the Old and New Testaments. *** Book XXI: the eternal punishment for the city of the devil. *** Book XXII: the eternal happiness for the saints and explanations of the resurrection of the body.

The Conservatoire national des arts et m√©tiers (; CNAM) is a doctoral degree-granting higher education establishment (or grand √©tablissement) and Grande √©cole in engineering, operated by the French government, dedicated to providing education and conducting research for the promotion of science and industry. It has a large museum of inventions accessible to the public. It was founded on 10 October 1794, during the French Revolution.Michel Nusimovici, Les √©coles de l'an III, 2010. It was first proposed by Abb√© Henri Gr√©goire as a \\"depository for machines, models, tools, drawings, descriptions and books in all the areas of the arts and trades\\".'LA CONVENTION ET LA CR√âATION DU CONSERVATOIRE' The deserted Saint-Martin-des- Champs Priory (and particularly its Gothic refectory by Pierre de Montereau) was selected as the site of collection, which formally opened in 1802.

The novel was published in 1989 prior to the pendulum being moved back to the Panth√©on during museum reconstruction.The pendulum at the Pantheon is said to be a copy of the original that still hangs in an 11th-century chapel inside the Mus√©e des Arts et M√©tiers.

It is named after the studio lot that was established in the area by film producer Mack Sennett in 1927, now known as CBS Studio Center. History Map of the Lankershim Ranch properties, 1887 Originally known as Laurelwood, the area that Studio City occupies was formerly part of Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando. This land changed hands several times during the late 19th Century and was eventually owned by James Boon Lankershim (1850‚Äì1931), and eight other developers who organized the Lankershim Ranch Land and Water Company. In 1899, however, the area lost most water rights to Los Angeles and therefore subdivision and sale of land for farming became untenable. Construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct began in 1908 and water reached the San Fernando Valley in November, 1913. Real estate boomed, and a syndicate led by Harry Chandler, business manager of the Los Angeles Times, with Hobart Johnstone Whitley, Isaac Van Nuys, and James Boon Lankershim acquired the remaining of the southern half of the former Mission lands‚Äîeverything west of the Lankershim town limits and south of present-day Roscoe Boulevard excepting the Rancho Encino. Whitley platted the area of present-day Studio City from portions of the existing town of Lankershim as well as the eastern part of the new acquisition. In 1927, Mack Sennett began building a new studio on 20 acres donated by the land developer. The area around the studio was named Studio City. In 1955, Studio City's Station 78 became the first racially integrated station in the Los Angeles City Fire Department. Population The 2000 U.S. census counted 34,034 residents in the 6.31-square-mile Studio City neighborhood‚Äî5,395 people per square mile, among the lowest population densities for the city but about average for the county. In 2008, the city estimated that the resident population had increased to 37,201. In 2000, the median age for residents, 38, was considered old for city and county neighborhoods; the percent of residents age 19 and older was among the county's highest. \\"Studio City,\\" Mapping L.A., Los Angeles Times The ethnic breakdown was whites, 78%; Latinos, 8.7%; Asians, 5.4%; blacks, 3.7%; and others, 4.1%. Iran (7%) and the United Kingdom (6.7%) were the most common places of birth for the 21.1% of the residents who were born abroad‚Äîa low percentage for Los Angeles. The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $75,657, considered high for the city. The percent of households earning $125,000 and up was high for Los Angeles County. The average household size of 1.9 people was low when compared to the rest of the city and the county. Renters occupied 55.9% of the housing stock and house- or apartment-owners held 44.1%. In 2000, there were 837 families headed by single parents, the rate of 11.2% being low for the city of Los Angeles. There were 2,591 veterans, 8.8% of the population, a high figure for the city.

Created by Ken Sugimori, Magikarp first appeared in the video games Pok√©mon Red and Blue and subsequent sequels. They have later appeared in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Known as the Fish Pok√©mon, Magikarp is found in many bodies of water, especially lakes, rivers, and ponds. Description Magikarp is a red, medium-sized fish. Its notable characteristics include large, heavy scales. Its fins are primarily white, but it has a stiff, three- pointed fin on its back and a four-pointed fin on its stomach which are both yellow. The shape of the dorsal fin resembles a crown, leading to its Japanese name Koiking. It also has long barbels, which are white on females and tan on males. Although this Pok√©mon is capable of surviving in even the most polluted ponds, it is usually overlooked by trainers because it is pathetically weak. Even in the heat of battle it will do nothing but flop around. They are normally seen using Splash, which is unusual, as it makes them easy targets to predators. Before the species multiplied, it is believed that the ancestors of Magikarp were actually much stronger than the Magikarp seen today, and this belief has led scientists to research this species. Long-lived Magikarp are able to utilize their immense splashing power to leap high enough to jump mountains. Magikarp is found in many bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, and ponds. It is not a strong swimmer, and currents in the water will sweep it downstream. The concept of Magikarp evolving into Gyarados is loosely based on the Chinese mythological tale of the Carps leaping over the Dragon Gate. According to the legend, carps that leap over a legendary waterfall, referred to as the Dragon Gate, are transformed into dragons. Magikarp has drawn comparisons to Feebas; however, the latter is usually regarded higher in the gaming community because it can learn far more moves than Magikarp in the Pok√©mon games. Appearances=In video games In the video game series, Magikarp is seen commonly when fishing with an Old or Good Rod. In Pok√©mon Red and Blue, and their remakes, an NPC will sell the player a Magikarp. A similar character appears in Pok√©mon Black and White. In Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl, Magikarp appear flopping around in a dried up lake. Outside of the main series, in Pok√©mon Stadium, Magikarp featured in its own mini game called \\"Magikarp Splash\\", in which players must Splash high enough to hit the button at the top of the screen as many times as it can. A mobile video game, called Pok√©mon: Magikarp Jump, was announced in February 2017 under the title Splash! Magikarp, and was released for Android and iOS on 25 May 2017. In other media In the anime, Magikarp has appeared several times, most notably as the subject of a running gag in which a salesman attempts to trick Team Rocket into buying Magikarp in various guises, the first one being in Battle Aboard the St. Anne. In The Joy of Pok√©mon, a Nurse Joy from the Orange Islands befriended a giant Magikarp that saved her as a child. It evolved into an equally large Gyarados, but it remained friendly, which happens rarely. In The Wacky Watcher, Ash, Misty and Tracey help a Pok√©mon Watcher named Dr. Quackenpoker observe the migration and evolution of a school of Magikarp. Another, in Ya See We Want an Evolution, was nicknamed the strongest Magikarp. This Magikarp was unique in that it was in fact able to battle very well, even knocking out Pikachu. Reception A Magikarp shaped taiyaki served in a restaurant in Japan. GamesRadar described it as \\"[t]he ultimate in useless Pok√©mon\\", though noted its evolution Gyarados as one of the \\"biggest\\" characters in the series. IGN called it \\"possibly the most docile, unassuming, and weak of all the monsters in the Pok√©mon world\\" and further described it as serving \\"solely as comic relief\\", until its evolution into Gyarados. IGN criticized Magikarp as the \\"worst Pok√©mon ever\\", citing its low statistics and inability to learn moves from Technical or Hidden Machines, calling it a \\"Water wussymon.\\" An IGN guide jokingly noted a trainer in Pok√©mon Platinum as having the \\"best team among those in the area\\" due to having six Magikarps, five of which are unable to attack. The book Gaming Cultures and Place in Asia-Pacific cited it as an \\"example of a common recurring and weak element\\" in the games, whose presence rather than function was to \\"emphasize the exclusivity and strength of other, rarer creatures for players to find\\". Loredana Lipperini, author of the book Generazione Pok√©mon: i bambini e l'invasione planetaria dei nuovi, described it as \\"innocuous-looking.\\" Kotaku's Stephen Totilo also gave criticism to Magikarp, commenting that the using it as his character in Pok√©mon Rumble made him learn the \\"hard way\\" that he \\"couldn't have had a worse idea.\\" The Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Good Game praised Pok√©Park Wii: Pikachu's Adventure for its faithfulness to various Pok√©mon's abilities; while Torterra and Hitmontop were described as using Razor Leaf and Rapid Spin, they merely described Magikarp's actions as just \\"being Magikarp.\\" The web site Bright Side of the Sun used an analogy involving Magikarp, commenting that the words \\"defense\\" and \\"rebounding\\" were \\"tossed around\\" more by their coach to them than \\"a Magikarp card at a Pok√©mon convention in 1997.\\" ReferencesFurther reading * External links * Magikarp on Bulbapedia * Magikarp on Pokemon.com Category:Fictional fish Category:Pok√©mon species Category:Video game characters introduced in 1996 Category:Video game characters with water abilities ca:L√≠nia evolutiva de Magikarp#Magikarp es:Anexo:Pok√©mon de la primera generaci√≥n#Magikarp pl:Lista Pok√©mon√≥w (121-140)#Magikarp ","title":"Magikarp"},{"id":"434502","text":"Tarzana is a neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, California. Tarzana is on the site of a former ranch owned by author Edgar Rice Burroughs. It is named after Burroughs' fictional jungle hero, Tarzan. hogs, 1921 History The area now known as Tarzana was occupied in 1797 by Spanish settlers and missionaries who established the San Fernando Mission. Later absorbed by Mexico, the land was surrendered to the United States in 1848 by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo following the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Under US rule it evolved into a series of large cattle ranches owned by local elites. Investors took over in the 1870s, turning grazing into large-scale wheat farm operation. The area was purchased in 1909 by the Los Angeles Suburban Homes Company. LA Times founder and publisher General Harrison Gray Otis invested in the company and also personally acquired in the center of modern-day Tarzana. In February 1919, Edgar Rice Burroughs, author of the popular Tarzan novels, arrived in California with his family, relocating from Oak Park, Illinois. He and his family had wintered in Southern California twice before, and he found the climate ideal. On March 1, Burroughs purchased Otis‚Äôs tract and established Tarzana Ranch. Burroughs subdivided and sold the land for residential development with neighboring small farms following suit. Geography Providence Tarzana Medical Center Boundaries Tarzana, which measures 8.79 square miles, is bounded on the south by Topanga State Park, on the east by Encino, on the north by Reseda and on the west by Woodland Hills. \\"San Fernando Valley\\", Mapping L.A., Los Angeles Times website \\"Tarzana\\" Mapping L.A., Los Angeles Times website Bing maps Victory Boulevard marks the northern edge of the neighborhood, Lindley Avenue the eastern, Corbin Avenue, with a jog to Oakdale Avenue, the western, and Topanga State Park the southern.The Thomas Guide, 2006, pages 530 and 560 Climate Tarzana experiences a hot-summer Mediterranean climate. Due to its inland location, there is a higher degree of diurnal temperature variation than more coastal areas of Los Angeles. Population The U.S. census counted 35,502 people living in Tarzana in 2000, and Los Angeles estimated the neighborhood's population at 37,778 in 2008. There were 4,038 people per square mile, among the lowest population densities in the city. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, the racial composition was predominantly white (70.7%), followed by Asian (5%), and black or African American (3.6%).

Iran (24.2%) and Mexico (12.1%) were the most common foreign places of birth. The percentage of divorced men and women was among the county's highest. Some 9% of the residents were military veterans, considered high for the city of Los Angeles. The percentages of residents aged 50 and older were among the county's highest. The median age, 38, was old when compared to the rest of the city and the county. The median household income in 2008 dollars was considered high, at $73,195.

The neighborhood includes a portion of the Santa Monica Mountains, which gives Sherman Oaks a lower population density than some other areas in Los Angeles. History A partner of the Los Angeles Suburban Homes Company, Gen. Moses Hazeltine Sherman, developed Sherman Oaks. The company had subdivided of land that would become Sherman Oaks. In 1927, each acre was sold for $780. Sherman's other major venture was the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad. In 1991, a group of homeowners living in the Chandler Estates area successfully petitioned former Los Angeles City Councilmember Zev Yaroslavsky to re-draw the boundaries of Sherman Oaks from Magnolia to Burbank Blvd to the north, and from Coldwater Canyon to Van Nuys Blvd to the west, with the goal of including their neighborhood. This request was nothing new to the San Fernando Valley; other neighborhoods had either sought to change their names, or sought to attach themselves onto more affluent neighborhoods. Residents in the area argued, however, that the area was originally part of Sherman Oaks, but was labeled Van Nuys instead through the creation of ZIP codes in 1962; a resident produced a property deed to butttress the case. Just a few weeks after the Chandler Estates area successfully seceded from Van Nuys, Magnolia Woods, a 45 block area bordered by Van Nuys Boulevard on the east and the San Diego Freeway on the west, and between Burbank and Magnolia Boulevards, also successfully petitioned Los Angeles City council member Marvin Braude to secede from Van Nuys and join Sherman Oaks. Petitioners in the area argued that their neighborhood was also part of Sherman Oaks, though they were only able to produce 22 deeds showing so. As a result of this change, Van Nuys Middle School became separated from its namesake neighborhood. Finally, in 2009, the Los Angeles City council voted to redraw neighborhood boundaries again to allow an area of about 1,800 homes in Van Nuys to be included. The 1994 Northridge earthquake caused damages in the surrounding area. The Community Redevelopment Agency sought to manage the rebuilding efforts. The homeowners in the Sherman Oaks area later won a lawsuit to prevent the agency from managing efforts. Geography The neighborhood is roughly bounded by Studio City to the east, Van Nuys to the north, Encino to the west, Bel Air and Beverly Hills Post Office to the south.  Demographics  Van Nuys Boulevard at Ventura Boulevard, 2008 La Reina Theater, 2008 2010 As of the 2010 census, according to the San Fernando Valley Almanac, Sherman Oaks had a population of 52,677 people and 25,255 households. The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 82% non-Hispanic white, 5% Asian American and 3% African American; 11% were Hispanic or Latino of any race. Other races made up less than 1%. 2000 The Los Angeles Times reported that the 2000 U.S. census counted 61,166 residents in the 9.15-square-mile Sherman Oaks neighborhood, including a wide swath of the Santa Monica Mountains‚Äîor 6,687 people per square mile, among the lowest population densities for the city. In 2008, the city estimated that the resident population had increased to 65,436. In 2000, the percentages of residents aged 19 to 49 and 65 and older were among the county's highest. The percentages of divorced residents and of widows were among the county's highest. The average household size of two people was low when compared to the rest of the city and the county. Renters occupied 58.9% of the housing stock and house- or apartment-owners held 41.1%. \\"Sherman Oaks,\\" Mapping L.A., Los Angeles Times The neighborhood was considered \\"not especially diverse\\" ethnically within Los Angeles, with a high percentage of white residents. The breakdown was whites, 73.8%; Latinos, 11.8%; Asians, 5.7%; blacks, 4.4%; and others, 4.4%. Iran (14.1%) and Mexico (8.8%) were the most common places of birth for the 26.2% of the residents who were born abroad‚Äîan average percentage for Los Angeles. The neighborhood had a median household income of $69,651 in 2008, which was high for the city of Los Angeles but about average for the county as a whole. (Median household income reports the amount of money earned by the household that falls exactly in the middle of the pack.) The percentage of households that earned $125,000 and up was high for Los Angeles County.

The LTA Gallery is located at the LTA office at Hampshire Road The Land Transport Authority (Abbreviation: LTA; Chinese: ÈôÜË∑Ø‰∫§ÈÄöÁÆ°ÁêÜÂ±Ä (shortform: ÈôÜ‰∫§Â±Ä); Malay: Penguasa Pengangkutan Darat; ) is a statutory board under the Ministry of Transport of Government of Singapore. It is located at Hampshire Road near Little India MRT station. History= Incorporation of Land Transport Authority  Land Transport Authority (LTA) was established on 1 September 1995, formed from the merger of various public sector entities, namely the Registry of Vehicles, Mass Rapid Transit Corporation, Roads & Transportation Division of the Public Works Department and Land Transportation Division of the former Ministry of Communications.  1996 Land Transport White Paper  In 1996, Land Transport Authority published the 1996 Land Transport White Paper, titled \\"A World Class Land Transport System\\". It outlined the government plans. Changes to existing schemes were proposed along with schemes were introduced across various transport sectors. This included the Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) scheme, which eventually become ubiquitous in the city state. = 1996 Rail Financing Framework = The 1996 Rail Financing Framework was a scheme that set out the financing framework of the rail transport system. In the white paper, it was phrased that the financing framework of the rail transport system would eventually be run on the basis of partnership, which the government and its regulatory authority would provide the assets and infrastructure (which remain fully owned by the regulatory authority), with commuters paying for the operating costs and operators extracting efficiency dividends within standards and fares set by the regulatory authority. The framework allowed for an open up of the rail transport market with the operation aspects of the industry no longer tied to the authorities, allowing for more autonomy of the incumbent operator and new operators to enter the market. This also laid the foundation for the restructure and flotation of SMRT Corporation, previously a state- owned incumbent operator under the name Mass Rapid Transit Corporation, in 2000. The framework was revised in 2008 as the New Rail Financing Framework (NRFF), which saw the regulatory authority re-assuming the full ownership of all rail assets, where the ownership and maintenance of which were previously held responsible under the individual operators.  Changes to public transport  To meet with the increasing number of commuters in Singapore, Land Transport Authority exercises on new changes over time. Rail LTA is responsible for the development of the rapid transit system and the expansion of the rail network. It aims to double the rail network by 2030. Since 2008, LTA has increased the length of Singapore's rail network from 138 km to about 180 km with the opening of the Boon Lay Extension in 2009, the Circle Line from 2009 to 2011 and the Circle Line Extension in 2012. Downtown Line, Thomson-East Coast Line are underway towards completion, with Cross Island Line and Jurong Region Line under planning. Half-height platform screen doors were installed in all 36 elevated stations in 2012 for the safety of passengers and to reduce delays in train service from track intrusions. HVLS fans are also installed at all elevated stations starting from 1 June 2012 and ending on 6 January 2013. Bus LTA took on the role of central bus network planner from 2009, working with communities and the bus operators, SBS Transit and SMRT Buses, to identify areas for bus improvements and to shift the focus to placing the commuter at the centre and taking a holistic approach in planning the bus network, taking into consideration development in the Rapid Transit System (RTS) network and other transport infrastructure. It is meant for their feedbacks, and any changes will be under the monthly updates, this has been brought through Bus Services Enhancement Programme. Under BSEP, about 80 new services are being introduced and 1000 buses are being added over five years. Quality of Service (QoS) standards have also been tightened to reduce waiting time and reduce crowding. Now, those with increased loads run every 10 minutes or less during weekday peak hours in 2015. Feeder bus services have become more frequent too, with 95% of bus services now running at intervals of 10 minutes or less during the weekday peak periods, tightened from 85%. Road projects Investment in road projects ensures that the economy will be ably supported with a strong and ever-improving transport infrastructure and coordinated system to help motorists to enjoy a safer and more pleasant journey. One such project is the introduction of the Parking Guidance System (PGS) in the city and HarbourFront area to guide drivers to the nearest parking facility with available parking spaces, reducing the need for vehicles to cruise around to find empty parking spaces. As part of investment in road projects, LTA will also be expanding the EMAS signages and upgrading the oldest EMAS signages in the expressways. To improve road safety, LTA implemented a variety of road engineering measures, such as adding pedestrian crossing lines with enhanced dash markings, traffic calming markings and \\"pedestrian crossing ahead\\" road markings in more locations in 2009. \\"Your Speed Signs\\", electronic signs displaying the speed of a passing vehicle, were also introduced so that motorists could be more aware of their speeds and would be more likely to keep to the speed limit. Road studs which flash in tandem with the green man signal at traffic junctions were also installed at more locations to alert motorists to stop for crossing pedestrians.

He's a singing, dancing, piano- playing dog who is considered to be \\"the first Merrie Melodies star\\", although he only starred in three cartoons. History The character is a tall, lanky anthropomorphic dog with scruffy whiskers and long, expressive ears. He was \\"a wisecracking entertainer -- 'part comedian, part musician and part dancer' -- inspired by vaudeville showmen of [the 1930s].\\" Goopy's character was based on a familiar archetype of entertainment, as Hank Sartin says in Reading the Rabbit: In all of his animated appearances, Goopy is depicted as light colored, but in an early promotional drawing for his first cartoon, he had black fur. Goopy Geer was the last attempt by animator Rudolf Ising to feature a recurring character in the Merrie Melodies series of films. Like most other early sound-era cartoon characters, Ising's Goopy has little personality of his own. Instead, he sings and dances his way through a musical world in perfect syncopation. Ising only featured the character in three cartoons. In the first, \\"Goopy Geer\\" (April 16, 1932), he plays a popular pianist entertaining at a nightclub. In Ising's other two Goopy films, both in 1932, he cast the dog first as a hillbilly in \\"Moonlight for Two\\" (June 11, 1932), then as a court jester in \\"The Queen Was in the Parlor\\" (July 9, 1932). All of these cartoons also feature Goopy's unnamed girlfriend who debuted without her gangly consort in the earlier Merrie Melodie \\"Freddy the Freshman\\" (February 20, 1932). A month after Goopy Geer's first cartoon had been released, Walt Disney released a cartoon called \\"Mickey's Revue\\" with a character named Dippy Dawg, whose overall appearance was very similar to that of Goopy Geer; due to the close proximity of the two cartoons' releases, there is little chance that either character was intended to be a copy of the other. Dippy Dawg would eventually be renamed to \\"Goofy\\". Goopy made a cameo in the Bosko cartoon \\"Bosko in Dutch\\" (January 14, 1933), but after Ising left Warner Bros. that same year, Goopy and other recurring Merrie Melodies characters were retired, to be later replaced by such recurring characters as Sniffles the Mouse, Inki and the Mynah Bird, the Curious Puppies, and, on two occasions, Porky Pig (a character who was more prevalent in the black and white Looney Tunes). Later appearances Goopy Geer had a small role in the 1990s animated series Tiny Toon Adventures episode \\"Two-Tone Town\\" voiced by Robert Morse. Goopy, reprising his role as the happy-go-lucky pianist from his first cartoon, meets the series' stars when they visit the \\"black-and-white\\" part of town. His appearance in this cartoon is updated somewhat and seems to be based on early promotional drawings where his fur is black rather than his actual cartoon appearances.

The species was described by Albert G√ºnther in 1877 after specimens arrived in London. By the end of the 19th century, most of the Pinta Island tortoises had been wiped out due to hunting. By the mid-20th century, the species was assumed to be extinct until a single male was discovered on the island in 1971. Efforts were made to mate the male, named Lonesome George, with other species, but no viable eggs resulted. Lonesome George died on 24 June 2012, and the species was believed to have become extinct with his death. However, 17 first-generation hybrids were reported in 2012 from Wolf Volcano on Isabela Island during a trip by Yale University researchers. As these specimens were juveniles, their parents might still be alive. The species is classified as extinct on the IUCN Red List. Taxonomy Dead specimen collected in 1905‚Äì1906 Lonesome George, along with other of the tortoises on Pinta Island, belonged to a genus of 21 species. Giant tortoises were once found on all of the continents except Australia and Antarctica. The Gal√°pagos tortoises remain the largest living tortoises. Albert G√ºnther, who described Testudo abingdonii in 1877 The Pinta Island tortoise was originally described in 1877 by German-born British herpetologist Albert G√ºnther, who named it Testudo abingdonii in his book The Gigantic Land-tortoises (Living and Extinct) in the Collection of the British Museum. The name abingdonii derives from Abingdon Island, now more commonly known as Pinta Island. The knowledge of its existence was derived from short statements of the voyages of Captain James Colnett in 1798 and Basil Hall in 1822. In 1876, Commander William Cookson brought three male specimens (along with other species of Gal√°pagos tortoise) to London aboard the Royal Navy ship HMS Peterel. Synonyms of Chelonoidis abingdonii include Testudo abingdonii G√ºnther, 1877; Testudo elephantopus abingdonii Mertens & Wermuth, 1955; Geochelone elephantopus abingdonii Pritchard, 1967; Geochelone nigra abingdonii Iverson, 1992; and Geochelone abingdonii Valverde, 2004. Evolution The origin and systematic relationships are still unresolved today; they captivated Charles Darwin himself. DNA sequencing results indicate that the three best candidates for the closest living relative of the Gal√°pagos tortoises all come from South America. They are the yellow-footed tortoise (Geochelone denticulata), the red-footed tortoise (Geochelone carbonaria), and the Chaco tortoise (Geochelone chilensis).  Behaviour and ecology  In the wild, Gal√°pagos tortoises, including the Pinta Island species, rest about 16 hours a day. Gal√°pagos tortoises are herbivores, feeding primarily on greens, grasses, native fruit, and cactus pads. They drink large quantities of water, which they can then store in their bodies for long periods of time for later use. They can reportedly survive up to six months without food or water. For breeding, the tortoises were most active during the hot season (January to May). During the cool season (June to November), female tortoises migrated to nesting zones to lay their eggs. Gal√°pagos giant tortoises represent the top herbivores in the Gal√°pagos, and as such they shape the entire island ecosystem. They provide critical ecosystem services by dispersing seeds and by acting as ecological engineers through herbivory and nutrient cycling. The extinction of the Pinta Island tortoise has diminished the functioning of the island ecosystem. Relationship with humans=Threats and conservation Several of the surviving species of Gal√°pagos tortoises are endangered. The decline of the population began in the 17th century as a result of visits by buccaneers and whalers. They hunted tortoises as a source of fresh meat, taking about 200,000 tortoises altogether. In 1958, goats were brought to Pinta Island and began eating much of the vegetation, to the detriment of the natural habitat. A prolonged effort to exterminate the goats was begun. As the goat populations declined, the vegetation recovered. Small trees began regenerating from the stumps left by the goats. Highland shrub species, forest tree seedlings, Opuntia cactus, and other endemic species increased. In 2003, Pinta Island was declared goat-free. In addition to conservation efforts such as the elimination of goat populations in the Gal√°pagos, there has been an effort to revive a number of species of Gal√°pagos tortoise through captive breeding. Future efforts may aim to recreate a population genetically similar to the original Pinta Island tortoise by breeding the first-generation hybrids discovered on Wolf Volcano. Lonesome George Lonesome George at the Charles Darwin Research Station The last known individual of the species was a male named Lonesome George (), who died on 24 June 2012. In his last years, he was known as the rarest creature in the world. George served as a potent symbol for conservation efforts in the Gal√°pagos and internationally. George was first seen on the island of Pinta on 1 December 1971 by Hungarian malacologist J√≥zsef V√°gv√∂lgyi. Relocated for his safety to the Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz Island, George was penned with two females of different species. Although the females laid eggs, none hatched. The Pinta tortoise was pronounced functionally extinct. Over the decades, all attempts at mating Lonesome George were unsuccessful, possibly because his species was not cross-fertile with the other species. On 24 June 2012, at 8:00 am local time, Director of the Gal√°pagos National Park Edwin Naula announced that Lonesome George had been found dead by his caretaker of 40 years, Fausto Llerena. Naula suspects that the cause of death was heart failure consistent with the end of the natural life of a tortoise. Possible remaining individuals In 2006, Peter Pritchard, one of the world's foremost authorities on Gal√°pagos tortoises, suggested that a male tortoise residing in the Prague Zoo might be a Pinta Island tortoise due to its shell structure. Subsequent DNA analysis, however, revealed it was more likely to be from Pinz√≥n Island, home of the species C. duncanensis. Whalers and pirates in the past used Isabela Island, the central and largest of the Gal√°pagos Islands, as a tortoise dumping ground. Today, the remaining tortoises that live around Wolf Volcano have combined genetic markers from several species. In May 2007, analysis of genomic microsatellites (DNA sequences) suggested that individuals from a translocated group of C. abingdonii may still exist in the wild on Isabela. Researchers identified one male tortoise from the Volcano Wolf region that had half his genes in common with George's species. This animal is believed to be a first-generation hybrid between the species of the islands Isabela and Pinta. This suggests the possibility of a pure Pinta tortoise among the 2,000 tortoises on Isabela. A subsequent trip to Isabela by Yale University researchers found 17 first-generation hybrids living at Wolf Volcano. The researchers planned to return to Isabela in the spring of 2013 to look for surviving Pinta tortoises and to try to collect hybrids in an effort to start a captive selective-breeding program and to hopefully reintroduce Pintas back to their native island.

Five Jews and four Arabs were killed, and several hundred were injured. The riots coincided with and are named after the Nebi Musa festival, which took place every year on Easter Sunday, and followed rising tensions in Arab-Jewish relations. The events came shortly after the Battle of Tel Hai and the increasing pressure on Arab nationalists in Syria in the course of the Franco-Syrian War. Speeches were given by Arab religious leaders during the festival (in which large numbers of Muslims traditionally gathered for a religious procession), which included slogans referencing Zionist immigration and previous confrontations around outlying Jewish villages in the Galilee. The trigger which turned the procession into a riot is not known with certainty - some evidence exists suggesting Jewish provocation, but it is also possible, though unreported, that Arab activities also contributed. The British military administration of Palestine was criticized for withdrawing troops from inside Jerusalem and because it was slow to regain control.Palin Report conclusions As a result of the riots, trust among the British, Jews, and Arabs eroded. One consequence was that the Jewish community increased moves towards an autonomous infrastructure and security apparatus parallel to that of the British administration. In its wake, sheikhs of 82 villages around the city and Jaffa, claiming to represent 70% of the population, issued a document protesting the demonstrations against the Jews. This condemnation may have been procured with bribes.Tom Segev,'When Zionism was an Arab cause,' at Haaretz, 6 April 2012. Notwithstanding the riots, the Palestinian Jewish community held elections for the Assembly of Representatives on 19 April 1920 among Jews everywhere in Palestine except Jerusalem, where they were delayed to 3 May.Palestine Through History: A Chronology (I) The Palestine Chronicle The riots also preceded the San Remo conference which was held from 19 to 26 April 1920 at which the fate of the Middle East was to be decided. Background British security forces searching Arab civilians, April 1920 Anti-Zionist demonstration at Damascus Gate, 8 March 1920 The contents and proposals of both the Balfour Declaration of 1917 and Paris Peace Conference, 1919, which later concluded with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, were the subject of intensive discussion by both Zionist and Arab delegations, and the process of the negotiations were widely reported in both communities. In particular, the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, led to an undertaking by the victorious powers, predominantly Great Britain and France, to assume a 'holy mission of civilization' in the power vacuum of the Middle East. Under the Balfour Declaration, a homeland for the Jewish people was to be created in Palestine. The principle of self- determination affirmed by the League of Nations was not to be applied to Palestine, given the foreseeable rejection by the people of Zionism, which the British sponsored. These post-World War I arrangements both for Palestine and other Arab societies led to a 'radicalization' of the Arab world. On 1 March 1920, the death of Joseph Trumpeldor in the Battle of Tel Hai at the hands of a Shiite group from Southern Lebanon, caused deep concern among Jewish leaders, who made numerous requests to the OETA administration to address the Yishuv's security and forbid a pro-Syrian public rally. However, their fears were largely discounted by the Chief Administrative Officer General Louis Bols, Military Governor Ronald Storrs and General Edmund Allenby, despite a warning from the head of the Zionist Commission Chaim Weizmann that a \\"pogrom is in the air\\", supported by assessments available to Storrs., pp. 127-144. Communiqu√©s had been issued about foreseeable troubles among Arabs, and between Arabs and Jews. To Weizmann and the Jewish leadership, these developments were reminiscent of instructions that Russian generals had issued on the eve of pogroms. In the meantime, local Arab expectations had been raised to a pitch by the declaration of the Syrian Congress on 7 March of the independence of Greater Syria in the Kingdom of Syria, with Faisal as its king, that included the British-controlled territory within its claimed domain. On 7 and 8 March, demonstrations took place in all cities of Palestine, shops were closed and many Jews were attacked. Attackers carried slogans such as \\"Death to Jews\\" or \\"Palestine is our land and the Jews are our dogs!\\", quoting the official history of the Hagana Jewish leaders requested that OETA authorise the arming of the Jewish defenders to make up for the lack of adequate British troops. Although this request was declined, Ze'ev Jabotinsky, together with Pinhas Rutenberg, led an effort to openly train Jewish volunteers in self-defense, an effort of which the Zionist Commission kept the British informed. Many of the volunteers were members of the Maccabi sports club and some of them were veterans of the Jewish Legion. Their month of training largely consisted of calisthenics and hand to hand combat with sticks. By the end of March, about 600 were said to be performing military drills daily in Jerusalem., p. 63; extract from a private letter dated 30 March 1920, citing CZA L3/27. Jabotinsky and Rutenberg also began organizing the collection of arms. The Nebi Musa festival was an annual spring Muslim festival that began on the Friday before Good Friday and included a procession to the Nebi Musa shrine (tomb of Moses) near Jericho. It had apparently existed since the time of Saladin. Arab educator and essayist Khalil al- Sakakini described how tribes and caravans would come with banners and weapons. The Ottoman Turks usually deployed thousands of soldiers and even artillery to keep order in the narrow streets of Jerusalem during the Nebi Musa procession. However, Storrs issued a warning to Arab leaders, but deployed only 188 policemen. 4‚Äì7 April 1920, Old City The Times report of the riots, Apr 08, 1920 Arab demonstrators in front of the Jerusalem municipality building, 1920 By 10:30 a.m. on Sunday, 4 April 1920, 60,000‚Äì70,000 Arabs had congregated in the city square for the Nebi Musa festival, and groups had been attacking Jews in the Old City's alleys for over an hour. Inflammatory anti-Zionist rhetoric was delivered by Amin al-Husayni from the balcony of the Arab Club. Another inciter was Musa al-Husayni, his uncle, the mayor, who spoke from the municipal building's balcony. The editor of the newspaper Suriya al-Janubia (Southern Syria), Aref al-Aref, another Arab Club member, delivered his speech on horseback at the Jaffa Gate. The nature of his speech is disputed. According to Benny Morris, he said \\"If we don't use force against the Zionists and against the Jews, we will never be rid of them\\", while Bernard Wasserstein wrote \\"he seems to have co-operated with the police, and there is no evidence that he actively instigated violence\\". In fact, Wasserstein adds, \\"Zionist intelligence reports of this period are unanimous in stressing that he spoke repeatedly against violence\\". The crowd reportedly shouted \\"Independence! Independence!\\" and \\"Palestine is our land, the Jews are our dogs!\\" Arab police joined in applause, and violence started., p. 123. The local Arab population ransacked the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem. The Torath Chaim Yeshiva was raided, and Torah scrolls were torn and thrown on the floor, and the building then set alight. During the next three hours, 160 Jews were injured. Khalil al-Sakakini witnessed the eruption of violence in the Old City: :\\"[A] riot broke out, the people began to run about and stones were thrown at the Jews. The shops were closed and there were screams. ‚Ä¶ I saw a Zionist soldier covered in dust and blood. ‚Ä¶ Afterwards, I saw one Hebronite approach a Jewish shoeshine boy, who hid behind a sack in one of the wall's comers next to Jaffa Gate, and take his box and beat him over the head. He screamed and began to run, his head bleeding and the Hebronite left him and returned to the procession. ‚Ä¶ The riot reached its zenith. All shouted, \\"Muhammad's religion was born with the sword\\". ‚Ä¶ I immediately walked to the municipal garden. ‚Ä¶ my soul is nauseated and depressed by the madness of humankind.\\"Khalil al-Sakakini, Such am I, Oh World!, quoted by Benny Morris, Righteous Victims The army imposed night curfew on Sunday night and arrested several dozen rioters, but on Monday morning they were allowed to attend morning prayers and were then released. Arabs continued to attack Jews and break into their homes, especially in Arab- majority mixed buildings. On Monday, as disturbances grew worse, the Old City was sealed off by the army and no one was allowed to exit the area. Martial law was declared, but looting, burglary, rape, and murder continued. Several homes were set on fire, and tombstones were shattered. British soldiers found that the majority of illicit weapons were concealed on the bodies of Arab women. On Monday evening, the soldiers were evacuated from the Old City, a step described in the Palin Report as \\"an error of judgment\\". Even with martial law, it took the British authorities another 4 days to restore order. The Old City's Jewish community had no training or weapons, and Jabotinsky's men had found themselves outside the walled Old City, and shut out by British soldiers. Two volunteers were able to enter the Jewish Quarter disguised as medical personnel to organize self-defense ‚Äì using rocks and boiling water. Five Jews and four Arabs died in the riots. Two-hundred and sixteen Jews were injured, 18 critically, and 23 Arabs, one critically. About 300 Jews were evacuated from the Old City. Accusations of British complicity Reaction of the soon-to-appointed High Commissioner for Palestine, Herbert Samuel, on a visit to Palestine a few days prior to the riots. Published in The Times. It was asserted soon after, by Chaim Weizmann and British army Lieutenant Colonel Richard Meinertzhagen, that Haj Amin al-Husseini had been put up to inciting the riot by British Field-marshal Allenby's Chief of Staff, Colonel Bertie Harry Waters-Taylor, to demonstrate to the world that Arabs would not tolerate a Jewish homeland in Palestine.For an interpretation that follows closely Meinertzhagen's reading of the events as a British army plot, see . The assertion was never proven, and Meinertzhagen was dismissed.Regarding the whole period preceding the riot, marked by conflicting rumours, Laurens writes:'For several months, the intelligence service Zionists organised in 1918 multiplied warnings about plots by Arab activists. These pieces of information never received any confirmation from the British (or French) intelligence service. Later Arab sources show this quite clearly: no one claimed responsibility for any planning (pr√©meditation) for the events, even several decades afterwards'. . The Zionist Commission noted that before the riots Arab milkmen started to demand their customers in Meah Shearim pay them on the spot, explaining that they would no longer be serving the Jewish neighbourhood. Christian storekeepers had marked their shops in advance with the sign of the cross so that they would not be mistakenly looted. A previous commission report also accused Storrs of inciting the Arabs, blaming him for sabotaging attempts to purchase the Western Wall as well. A petition circulated among American citizens and presented to their consul protested that the British had prevented Jews from defending themselves. After the violence broke out, Ze'ev Jabotinsky met Military Governor Storrs and suggested deployment of his volunteers, but his request was rejected. Storrs confiscated his pistol and demanded to know the location of his other weapons, threatening to arrest him for possessing a firearm. Later, Storrs changed his mind and asked for 200 volunteers to report to the police headquarters to be sworn in as deputies. After they arrived and the administering of the oath had begun, orders came to cease and he sent them away. Arab volunteers had also been invited, and were likewise sent away. On Sunday night, the first day of the riots, several dozen rioters were arrested, but on Monday morning they were allowed to attend morning prayers and were then released. On Monday evening, after martial law was declared, the soldiers were evacuated from the Old City, a step described in the Palin Report as \\"an error of judgment\\". After the riots, Storrs visited Menachem Ussishkin, the new head of the Zionist Commission, to express \\"regrets for the tragedy that has befallen us\\". \\\\- Ussishkin asked, \\"What tragedy?\\" \\\\- \\"I mean the unfortunate events that have occurred here in the recent days\\", Storrs said. \\\\- \\"His excellency means the pogrom\\", suggested Ussishkin. When Storrs hesitated to categorize the events as such, Ussishkin replied, \\\\- \\"You Colonel, are an expert on matters of management and I am an expert on the rules of pogroms.\\" The Palin Report noted that Jewish representatives persisted in describing the events as a \\"pogrom\\", implying that the British administration had connived in the violence.Palin Report 1920, British National Archives (FO 371/5121) p.41:'Dr. de Sola Pool gave as his definition of the word that it meant \\"an attack on the Jews of the city carried out by the lower lawless elements who were given free play by the non-interference of the police and those charged with the keeping of order. Not necessarily with the connivance of the Government, but almost invariably of the lower police officials\\".' Palin Commission of Inquiry The Palin Commission (or Palin Court of Inquiry), a committee of inquiry sent to the region in May 1920 by the British authorities, examined the reasons for this trouble. According to the Survey of Palestine:A Survey of Palestine, 1945‚Äì1946, Volume 1, p17 > Savage attacks were made by Arab rioters in Jerusalem on Jewish lives and > property.

The Palin Report on the April riots was not signed until July 1920, after the San Remo conference and replacement of the British OETA by a High Commissioner, Sir Herbert Samuel. The Report was submitted in August 1920, though never published, and was critical of both sides. The report blamed the Zionists, 'whose impatience to achieve their ultimate goal and indiscretion are largely responsible for this unhappy state of feeling‚ÄôSahar Huneidi,A Broken Trust: Herbert Samuel, Zionism and the Palestinians 1920-1925, I.B.Taurus, 2001 p.35 and singled out Amin al-Husayni and Ze'ev Jabotinsky in particular. The latter, however, was not, as the Court believed, an exponent of 'Bolshevism', which it thought 'flowed in Zionism's inner heart', but rather fiercely anti-Socialist. They had confused his politics with that of the Socialist-aligned Poalei Zion ('Zionist Workers') party, which it called 'a definite Bolshevist institution.' The report was critical of some of the actions of OETA military command, particularly the withdrawal of troops from inside Jerusalem early on the morning of Monday, 5 April and that, once martial law had been proclaimed, it was slow to regain control. Aftermath Musa Kazim al-Husayni, the mayor of Jerusalem, was dismissed by the British after the April riots. Over 200 people were put on trial as a result of the riots, including 39 Jews. Musa Kazim al-Husayni was replaced as mayor by the head of the rival Nashashibi clan, Ragheb Bey Nashashibi.Zeina B. Ghandour, A Discourse on Domination in Mandate Palestine: Imperialism, Property and Insurgency, Routledge 2009 pp.128,141. Amin al-Husayni and Aref al-Aref were arrested for incitement, but when they were let out on bail they both escaped to Syria. In another version, al-Aref was warned and escaped before being arrested. In their absence, a military court sentenced them to 10 years imprisonment. The Arab riots were publicly protested by sheikhs from 82 villages in the Jerusalem and Jaffa areas who issued a formal statement saying that, in their view, Zionist settlement was not a danger to their communities. Similar declarations would be repeated in cablegrams sent to London in 1922, as hundreds of sheikhs and muhktars lent their authority and support to Jewish immigration. The tenor of these positions was that such immigration would, as the Zionist movement itself affirmed, improve the lives of Arabs as industrial development progressed. The sheikhs protesting the riots, and telegramming later the British colonial secretary to express solidarity with the Zionist programme were sometimes bribed to state this position by the World Zionist Organisation. Their opinions were procured. British soldiers were sent to search Jews for arms at the demand of the Palestinian Arab leadership. They searched the offices and apartments of Chaim Weizmann, the head of the Zionist Commission, and Jabotinsky. At Jabotinsky's house, they found three rifles, two pistols, and 250 rounds of ammunition. Nineteen men were arrested, but not Jabotinsky, who went to the jail of his own volition to insist on his arrest. A military judge released him because he had not been home when the guns were discovered, but he was again arrested a few hours later. Jabotinsky was convicted of possessing the pistol that Storrs had confiscated on the riot's first day, among other things. The primary witness was none other than Ronald Storrs, who said he \\"did not remember\\" being told about the self-defence organization. He was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment and sent to Egypt, though the next day he was returned to Acre Prison. Jabotinsky's trial and sentencing created an uproar, and were protested by London press including The Times and questioned in the British Parliament. Even before the editorials appeared, the commander of British forces in Palestine and Egypt, General Congreve, wrote Field Marshal Wilson that Jews were sentenced far more severely than Arabs who had committed worse offences. He reduced Jabotinsky's sentence to a year, and that of the other 19 Jews arrested with him to six months. The new civilian government under Herbert Samuel granted a general amnesty in early 1921. However, Amin al-Husayni and Aref al-Aref were excluded from the amnesty because they had fled before their convictions had been passed down. Samuel pardoned Amin in March 1921 and appointed him Mufti of Jerusalem. When the Supreme Muslim Council was created in the following year, Husseini demanded and received the title Grand Mufti,:'Soon after the British began to style KƒÅmil al-Husaynƒ´ as the Grand Muftƒ´ (al-muftƒ´ al-akbar), a title which had hitherto been unknown in Palestine but which was probably copied from Egypt.This gesture was, in part, meant as a reward for KƒÅmil‚Äôs cooperation with the British, but it may have been intended to substitute some kind of a new hierarchy for the former Ottoman one'.:'He demanded that the title Grand Mufti, which had been granted to his brother by the British for cooperating with them, also be given to him, and that his salary be higher than that of the other muftis. Richmond and Storrs supported this claim, arguing that since, from the spiritual and religious points of view, the status of Jerusalem was superior to that of other regions in Palestine, the Mufti of Jerusalem should be considered head of the country's Muslim community'.:'After their occupation of the country, the British created the entirely new post of \\"grand mufti of Palestine\\" (al-mufti al-akbar), who was also designated the \\"mufti of Jerusalem and the Palestine region\\" (mufti al- Quds wal-diyar al-filistiniyya).. a position which came with life tenure.:. Also, General Storrs became the civil governor of Jerusalem under the new administration. As the riots began, Jewish immigration to Palestine was temporarily halted by the British. Also, feeling that the British were unwilling to defend Jewish settlements from continuous Arab attacks, Palestinian Jews set up self-defense units, which came to be called the Haganah (\\"defense\\"). Furthermore, the riots increased the feeling of Palestinian nationalism within the Palestinian Arab community.

Although a popular governor and an able administrator, Eden's authority was overthrown by the events of the American Revolution, and in June 1776 he was invited by the Maryland Convention to leave for England. Eden was well-regarded at home and in the same year, 1776, he was made a baronet. He eventually returned to Maryland where he died in 1784 at the age of 42. He was buried in Annapolis and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son, Frederick, a noted author. Early life Eden was born in Durham, England, on 14 September 1741, the second son of Sir Robert Eden, 3rd Baronet, of West Auckland, and the brother of William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland and Morton Eden, 1st Baron Henley and a relative of North Carolina Governor Charles Eden. Career In 1763 Eden made an advantageous marriage, wedding the Hon. Caroline Calvert, daughter of Maryland's proprietor Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore. In 1766 Caroline bore a son, Frederick. Three years later, in 1769, aged just 28, Robert Eden succeeded Horatio Sharpe as Governor of Maryland, the highest office in the Province. As Governor, Eden would attempt to maintain authority over the increasingly rebellious Province during the tumultuous years preceding the American Revolution. Maryland and the American War of Independence Eden was not among those who believed that coercion would force Marylanders into loyalty to the mother country. During the 1770s opposition to British taxation grew, and the Governor's authority began to falter. On 19 April 1774 Eden was forced to prorogue the Colonial Assembly, the last occasion on which it would convene. From this point on the government of Maryland was increasingly in the hands of the Revolutionaries. On 19 October 1774 the Peggy Stewart was burned in Annapolis harbour in protest against taxes on tea, in imitation of the famous Boston Tea Party, which took place on 16 December 1773. On 30 December 1774 Eden wrote: > The spirit of resistance against the Tea Act, or any mode of internal > taxation, is as strong and universal here as ever. I firmly believe that > they will undergo any hardship sooner than acknowledge a right in the > British Parliament in that particular, and will persevere in their non- > importation and non-exportation experiments, in spite of every inconvenience > that they must consequently be exposed to, and the total loss of their > trade.Andrews, p.303 Although Eden had some sympathy with the colonists' grievances, he was firmly opposed to armed opposition to the Crown. In the event, Maryland was the only state that did not forcibly eject its last colonial governor from office, choosing instead a formal and largely courteous transfer of power. By 1775 Eden's authority had been effectively usurped by the Annapolis Convention and Eden was eventually asked by the Maryland Council of Safety to step down as governor. The Maryland Convention had been pressed by the Continental Congress (and the Virginians in particular) to arrest and detain Eden but they demurred, preferring to avoid such an \\"extreme\\" measure. Instead they argued that: > This Convention, and the Council of Safety for the time being, were the only > proper and adequate judges of the propriety and expediency of suffering > Governor Eden to depart out of this Province, and have proceeded in that > matter upon evidence which was satisfactory to themselves, and to which the > convention of Virginia were strangersAndrews, p.317 Eventually the Maryland Convention formally asked the Governor to leave, and Governor Eden finally departed Maryland for England in the ship Fowey on 23 June 1776. He was created a baronet, of Maryland in North America, on 19 October 1776. Family life Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore, Eden's father-in-law.

Eagle Rock, 1900 Eagle Rock is a neighborhood of Northeast Los Angeles, located between the cities of Glendale and Pasadena, abutting the San Rafael Hills in Los Angeles County, California. Eagle Rock is named after a large rock whose shadow resembles an eagle with its wings outstretched. Eagle Rock was once part of the Rancho San Rafael under Spanish and Mexican governorship. In 1911, Eagle Rock was incorporated as a city, and in 1923 it combined with the City of Los Angeles. Today, it is an ethnically diverse, relatively high-income neighborhood (by national standards)‚Äîthe latter of which has risen in part due to the gentrification of Northeast Los Angeles that began in the 2000s and picked up in the 2010s. The neighborhood is known for being the home of Occidental College and for a counterculture element among its 34,000 residents. Eagle Rock maintains a number of historically significant buildings and has a connection with the motion picture industry. There are nine public schools‚Äîincluding two high schools‚Äîand six private schools, as well as a branch public library. Nomenclature A massive boulder at the district's northern edge contains an indentation which casts a bird-shaped shadow on the rock at certain times of day, giving the neighborhood its name. Eagle Rock Neighborhood Council, History of. Retrieved June 24, 2010 History Before the arrival of European settlers, the secluded valley below the San Rafael Hills that is roughly congruent to Eagle Rock's present boundaries was inhabited by the Tongva people, whose staple food was the acorns from the valley's many oak trees.Eagle Rock Historical Society Time Line. Retrieved June 24, 2010 These aboriginal inhabitants were displaced by Spanish settlers in the late 18th century, with the area incorporated into the Rancho San Rafael. Following court battles, the area known as Rancho San Rafael was divided into 31 parcels in 1870. Benjamin Dreyfus was awarded what is now called Eagle Rock. In the 1880s Eagle Rock existed as a farming community. The arrival of American settlers and the growth of Los Angeles resulted in steadily increasing semi-rural development in the region throughout the late 19th century. The construction of Henry Huntington's Los Angeles Railway trolley line up Eagle Rock Boulevard to Colorado Boulevard and on Colorado to Townsend Avenue commenced the rapid suburbanization of the Eagle Rock Valley. Although Eagle Rock‚Äîwhich is geographically located between the cities of Pasadena and Glendale‚Äîwas once incorporated as Eagle Rock City in 1911, it was thereafter annexed to the City of Los Angeles in 1923 due to need for an adequate water supply and a high school. Several of the major crime sprees that have become part of Los Angeles' late 20th century history have left their mark on the neighborhood. An early victim of the Hillside Strangler was discovered in an Eagle Rock neighborhood on October 31, 1977. The discovery, along with the successive murders of at least 10 other women in the area over the course of five months, rocked what was then a small, close-knit community on the outskirts of Los Angeles. In an opinion piece to the Los Angeles Times on December 6, 1977, a resident under the pseudonym Deirdre Blackstone wrote of the fear experienced by the community: \\"Groups of gum-chewing girls in look-alike hairdos and jeans who used to haunt the Eagle Rock Plaza ‚Äî they too are keeping close to home ... We are all afraid. For women living alone, ours is an actual visceral fear that starts at the feet. Then it hits the knees ‚Äî and finally it grips the mind.\\" Two men, Kenneth Bianchi and Angelo Buono, were subsequently convicted of the murders. On the night of March 20, 1985, an 8-year-old girl was abducted from her home in Eagle Rock and sexually assaulted by a man dubbed the \\"Valley Intruder,\\" \\"Walk-in Killer\\" and \\"The Night Stalker,\\" later identified as Richard Ramirez. This was the seventh in a long string of murders and sexual assaults committed by Ramirez in Los Angeles and San Francisco before he was apprehended. In 2002, an effort to designate an area of the community as \\"Philippine Village\\" for the large Filipino American population was stopped. Like the surrounding areas of Northeast Los Angeles, Eagle Rock has undergone gentrification. Beginning in the 2000s and picking up speed in the 2010s, the ‚Äúauthentic urbanism‚Äù and ‚Äúsmall-town intimacy‚Äù of the area's boulevards have played a role in drawing young professionals and fostering an emergent hipster culture. As a result, housing prices have dramatically risen and a new wave of restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and art galleries have appeared over the last decade. Population The neighborhood is inhabited by a wide variety of ethnic and socioeconomic groups and the creative class. Over the past decade the Eagle Rock and neighboring Highland Park have been experiencing gentrification as young urban professionals have moved from nearby neighborhoods such as Los Feliz and Silver Lake. A core of counter-culture writers, artists and filmmakers has existed in Eagle Rock since the 1920s. According to the \\"Mapping L.A.\\" project of the Los Angeles Times, the 2000 U.S. census counted 32,493 residents in the Eagle Rock neighborhood ‚Äî or 7,644 people per square mile, an average population densities for both the city and the county. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 34,466. In 2000 the median age for residents was 35, about average for city and county neighborhoods. \\"Eagle Rock,\\" Mapping L.A., Los Angeles Times The neighborhood was considered \\"highly diverse\\" ethnically within Los Angeles, with a relatively high percentage of Asian people. The breakdown was Latinos, 40.3%; whites, 29.8%; Asians, 23.9%; blacks, 1.8%; and others, 4.1%. The Philippines (35.1%) and Mexico (25.1%) were the most common places of birth for the 38.5% of the residents who were born abroad‚Äîan average figure for Los Angeles. The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $67,253, considered high for the city. The neighborhood's income levels, like its ethnic composition, can still be marked by notable diversity, but typically ranges from lower-middle to upper-middle class.\\"Mapping America,\\" New York Times Renters occupied 43.9% of the housing stock, and house- or apartment- owners held 56.1%.

Geography Eagle Rock is bordered by the City of Glendale on the north and west, Highland Park on the southeast, Glassell Park on the southwest and the cities of Pasadena and South Pasadena on the east. Major thoroughfares include Eagle Rock Boulevard and Colorado Boulevard, with Figueroa Street along the eastern boundary. The Glendale and Ventura freeways run along the district's western and northern edges, respectively. Notable sights Hill Avenue, now Hill Drive, is historically considered one of Eagle Rock's most beautiful streets. Other streets include Royal Drive (now Mt. Royal Drive), Acacia Street (now Laverna Avenue), Kenilworth Avenue (now Hermosa Avenue), Highland Avenue (now Highland View Avenue), and Fairmont Avenue (now Maywood Avenue). In the 1950s, newer streets such as Kincheloe Drive were extended into the hillsides for the building of larger homes with a view of the city. Today these streets are dotted with large and expensive homes on wide lots. The neighborhood is home to many historic and architecturally significant homes, many done in the Craftsman, Georgian, Streamline Moderne, Art Deco and Mission Revival styles. Eagle Rock, once a separate municipality, still has its original City Hall (Historic and Cultural Monument #59, 2035 Colorado Blvd.). Its original library, which was built with the aid of a Carnegie grant in 1914, was replaced in 1927 with a new structure which used one wall and the basement of the old library.

He is considered the father of cognitive clinical psychology and is best known for his theory of personality, personal construct psychology. Biography George Alexander Kelly was born in 1905 on a farm near Perth, Sumner County, Kansas to two strictly religious parents. He was their only child. They moved frequently during his childhood years, resulting in a fragmented early education. He later attended Friends University and Park College, where he received a bachelor's degree in physics and mathematics. Early on, he was interested in social problems, and he went on to get his masters degree in sociology at the University of Kansas, where he wrote a thesis on workers' leisure activities. He also completed minor studies in labor relations. Kelly taught at various colleges and other institutions, with course topics ranging from speech-making to \\"Americanization\\". In 1929, after receiving an exchange scholarship, he completed a Bachelor of Education degree at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, writing a thesis dealing with the prediction of teaching success. He then returned to the United States to continue psychology studies and completed a graduate and doctoral degrees in psychology at the State University of Iowa in 1931. After he received his Ph.D in Psychology, Kelly worked as a psychotherapist in Kansas. His dissertation was on speech and reading disabilities. For some years before World War II, Kelly worked in school psychology, developing a program of traveling clinics which also served as a training ground for his students. He had a keen interest in clinical diagnosis. It was during this period that Kelly left behind this interest in psychoanalytic approach to human personality, because he said people were more troubled by natural disasters than any psychological issue, such as the libidinal forces. In World War II, Dylan Brundage and Kelly worked as an aviation psychologist, where, among other things, he was responsible for a training program for local civilian pilots. After the war, he was appointed professor and director of clinical psychology at the Ohio State University, where he remained for twenty years. Under his guidance, OSU's graduate psychology training programs became some of the best in the United States, offering a unique blend of clinical skills and a strong commitment to scientific methodology. It is also at OSU that Kelly developed his major contribution to the psychology of personality. The Psychology of Personal Constructs was published in 1955 and achieved immediate international recognition, gaining him visiting appointments at various universities in the US as well as in Europe, the former Soviet Union, South America, the Caribbean, and Asia. He was also elected president of the clinical and the consulting divisions of the American Psychological Association, and served as president of the American Board of Examiners in Professional Psychology, providing expertise and insight, especially regarding ethical issues. Kelly went on a world tour in 1961, invited to speak about his essays and articles all over the country. In 1964, Kelly wrote a paper for the First Old Saybrook Conference, which has been renamed to Association for Humanistic Psychology (AHP). Kelly's paper, \\"The threat of aggression\\", was later published in the Journal of Humanistic Psychology. Kelly transferred from Ohio State University to Brandeis University in the United States for the psychology department. Kelly noted: \\"Johann Herbart's work on education and particularly mathematical psychology influenced me. I think mathematics is the pure instance of construct functioning‚Äîthe model of human behavior\\" Although Kelly was influenced by Herbart‚Äîa philosopher, psychologist, and founder of pedagogy as an academic discipline‚Äîsome of Kelly's inspiration for the theory of personal constructs came from a close friend of his. Namely, this friend had been an actor in some drama in college, and for two or three weeks he really got into his character and lived it as it was the real him. Kelly, unlike many people who would see this only as a sheer affectation, thought this was the expression of his real self and the behavior was authentic. Kelly also worked extensively on researching the implications and applications of his theory, while continuing to work in clinical psychology. Joseph Rychlak is among his prominent students who expanded on his theories. Brendan A. Maher, who became a professor himself, published a selection of Kelly's essays and articles after his death. Kelly had all his students refer to him as \\"Professor Kelly\\", however when they would receive a Ph.D. dissertation they could call him George and he would also call them by their first name instead of \\"Miss\\", \\"Mrs.\\", or \\"Mister\\". George Kelly died on March 6, 1967, at the age of 61, just two years after accepting the Riklis Chair of Behavioral Science at Brandeis University. Kelly's ideas are still used in today's findings to explore personality into greater depths. His ideas also help to uncover the patterns of behavior.  Work = Kelly's concerns  Kelly did not like his theory being compared to other theories. Oftentimes, people believed Kelly's personal construct theory was similar to humanistic theories or cognitive theories, but Kelly thought of his theory as its own category of theories. Some say Kelly was similar to Ulric Neisser, \\"the father of cognitive psychology\\", because they both studied cognitive psychology characteristics, others say Kelly was similar to Abraham Maslow, the creator of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, because they both studied humanistic psychology characteristics. Although Kelly's research had some humanistic psychology characteristics, it differed from that field in many ways as well. Kelly hated being known as a cognitive psychologist‚Äîso much so, he almost wrote another book stating his theory had no link to cognitive theories. Kelly saw that current theories of personality were so loosely defined and difficult to test that in many clinical cases the observer contributed more to the diagnosis than the patient. If people took their problems to a Freudian analyst, they would be analysed in Freudian terms; a Jungian would interpret them in Jungian terms; a behaviourist would interpret them in terms of conditioning; and so on. Kelly acknowledged that both the therapist and patient would each bring a unique set of constructs to bear in the consulting room. Therefore, the therapist could never be completely \\"objective\\" in construing his or her client's world. The effective therapist was, however, one who construed the patient's material at a high level of abstraction within the patient's (as opposed to the therapist's) system of construction. The therapist could then comprehend the ways in which the patient saw the world that were disordered and help the patient to change his or her maladaptive constructs.  Personal construct psychology  Kelly's fundamental view of personality was that people are like naive scientists who see the world through a particular lens, based on their uniquely organized systems of construction, which they use to anticipate events. Personal construct theory explores the individual's map they form by coping with the psychological stresses of their lives. But because people are naive scientists, they sometimes employ systems for construing the world that are distorted by idiosyncratic experiences not applicable to their current social situation. A system of construction that chronically fails to characterize and/or predict events, and is not appropriately revised to comprehend and predict one's changing social world, is considered to underlie psychopathology (or mental illness.) The body of Kelly's work, The Psychology of Personal Constructs, was written in 1955 when Kelly was a professor at Ohio State University. The first three chapters of the book were republished by W. W. Norton in paperback in 1963 and consist only of his theory of personality which is covered in most personality books. The re-publication omitted Kelly's assessment technique, the rep grid test, and one of his techniques of psychotherapy (fixed role therapy), which is rarely practiced in the form he proposed. Kelly believed that each person had their own idea of what a word meant. If someone were to say their sister is shy, the word \\"shy\\" would be interpreted in different ways depending on the person's personal constructs they had already associated with the word \\"shy\\". Kelly wanted to know how the individual made sense of the world based on their constructs. Kelly believed that a person's own meaning and definition is the foundation of who and what that person is and helps give shape to a person's idea of what the world is based on their individual constructs. On the other hand, Kelly's fundamental view of people as naive scientists was incorporated into most later-developed forms of cognitive- behavioral therapy that blossomed in the late 70s and early 80s, and into intersubjective psychoanalysis which leaned heavily on Kelly's phenomenological perspective and his notion of schematic processing of social information. Kelly's personality theory was distinguished from drive theories (such as psychodynamic models) on the one hand, and from behavioral theories on the other, in that people were not seen as solely motivated by instincts (such as sexual and aggressive drives) or learning history but by their need to characterize and predict events in their social world. Because the constructs people developed for construing experience have the potential to change, Kelly's theory of personality is less deterministic than drive theory or learning theory. People could conceivably change their view of the world and in so doing change the way they interacted with it, felt about it, and even others' reactions to them. For this reason, it is an existential theory, regarding humankind as having a choice to reconstrue themselves, a concept Kelly referred to as constructive alternativism. Constructs provide a certain order, clarity, and prediction to a person's world. Kelly referenced many philosophers in his two volumes but the theme of new experience being at once novel and familiar (due to the templates placed on it) is closely akin to the notion of Heraclitus: \\"we step and do not step in the same rivers.\\" Experience is new but familiar to the extent that it is construed with historically derived constructs. Kelly defined constructs as bipolar categories‚Äîthe way two things are alike and different from a third‚Äîthat people employ to understand the world. Examples of such constructs are \\"attractive,\\" \\"intelligent,\\" \\"kind.\\" A construct always implies contrast. So when an individual categorizes others as attractive, or intelligent, or kind, an opposite polarity is implied. This means that such a person may also evaluate the others in terms of the constructs \\"ugly,\\" \\"stupid,\\" or \\"cruel.\\" In some cases, when a person has a disordered construct system, the opposite polarity is unexpressed or idiosyncratic. The importance of a particular construct varies among individuals. The adaptiveness of a construct system is measured by how well it applies to the situation at hand and is useful in predicting events. All constructs are not used in every situation because they have a limited range (range of convenience). Adaptive people are continually revising and updating their own constructs to match new information (or data) that they encounter in their experience. Kelly's theory was structured as a testable scientific treatise with a fundamental postulate and a set of corollaries. * Fundamental postulate: \\"A person's processes are psychologically channelized by the ways in which he [or she] anticipates events.\\" * The construction corollary: \\"a person anticipates events by construing their replications.\\" This means that individuals anticipate events in their social world by perceiving a similarity with a past event (construing a replication). * The experience corollary: \\"a person's construction system varies as he successively construes the replication of events.\\" * The dichotomy corollary: \\"a person's construction system is composed of a finite number of dichotomous constructs.\\" * The organization corollary: \\"each person characteristically evolves, for his convenience in anticipating events, a construction system embracing ordinal relationships between constructs.\\" * The range corollary: \\"a construct is convenient for the anticipation of a finite range of events only.\\" * The modulation corollary: \\"the variation in a person's construction system is limited by the permeability of the constructs within whose range of convenience the variants lie.\\" * The choice corollary: \\"a person chooses for himself that alternative in a dichotomized construct through which he anticipates the greater possibility for extension and definition of his system.\\" * The individuality corollary: \\"persons differ from each other in their construction of events.\\" * The commonality corollary: \\"to the extent that one person employs a construction of experience which is similar to that employed by another, his psychological processes are similar to the other person.\\" * The fragmentation corollary: \\"a person may successively employ a variety of construction subsystems which are inferentially incompatible with each other.\\" * The sociality corollary: \\"to the extent that one person construes the construction processes of another, he may play a role in a social process involving the other person.\\" Disordered constructs are those in which the system of construction is not useful in predicting social events and fails to change to accommodate new information. In many ways, Kelly's theory of psychopathology (or mental disorders) is similar to the elements that define a poor theory. A disordered construct system does not accurately predict events or accommodate new data. Dimensions of transitions Transitional periods in a person's life occur when he or she encounters a situation that changes his or her naive theory (or system of construction) of the way the world is ordered. They can create anxiety, hostility, and/or guilt and can also be opportunities to change one's constructs and the way one views the world. The terms anxiety, hostility, and guilt had unique definitions and meanings in personal construct theory (The Psychology of Personal Constructs, Vol. 1, 486‚Äì534). Anxiety develops when a person encounters a situation that his or her construct system does not cover, an event unlike any he or she has encountered. An example of such a situation is a woman from the western United States who is accustomed to earthquakes, who moves to the eastern United States and experiences great anxiety because of a hurricane. While an earthquake might be of greater magnitude, she experiences greater anxiety with the hurricane because she has no constructs to deal with such an event. She is caught \\"with her constructs down.\\" Similarly, a boy who has been abused in early childhood may not have the constructs to accommodate kindness from others. Such a boy might experience anxiety in an outstretched hand that others view as benevolent. Guilt is dislodgement from one's core constructs. A person feels guilt if he or she fails to confirm the constructs that define him or her. This definition of guilt is radically different from in other theories of personality. Kelly used the example of the man who regards others as cow-like creatures \\"making money and giving milk.\\" Such a man might construe his role in relationship to others in terms of his ability to con favors or money from them. Such a man, who other psychologists might call a ruthless psychopath, and see as unable to experience guilt, feels guilt, according to Kelly's theory, when he is unable to con others: He is then alienated from his core constructs. Hostility is \\"attempting to extort confirmation of a social prediction that is already failing.\\" When a person encounters a situation in which s/he expects one outcome and receives quite a different one, s/he should change his/her theory or constructs rather than trying to change the situation to match his/her constructs. But the person who continually refuses to modify his or her belief system to accommodate new data, and in fact tries to change the data, is acting in bad faith and with hostility. Hostility, in Kelly's theory, is analogous to a scientist \\"fudging\\" his or her data. An example might be a professor who sees himself as a brilliant educator who deals with poor student reviews by devaluing the students or the means of evaluation.  Rep test  Rep stands for repertory grid. In 1955, George Kelly created an interactive grid known as the rep test based on his personal construct theory. The repertory grid is a mathematical way of giving meaning to one's own, or other people's, personal constructs. The repertory grid test needs a set of elements (such as people or things), and a set of constructs created by the individual. The test asks a person to list people or things that are important, then the responses are split into groups of three. There are three role-titles in each row; the person is to think how two of the constructs are alike, and how the other is different from the two that are alike. The responses are sorted into two poles, an emergent pole and implicit pole. The emergent pole is the way in which two elements are similar, while the implicit pole is the way in which the third element differs from the two that are similar. After extracting a construct, the individual analyzes the role-titles and checks the elements that are best described under the emergent pole and leaves blank the elements best described under the implicit pole. Kelly's repertory grid test can be used in many different situations, from clinical psychology to marketing, due to its ability to apply constructs to any kind of event. Kelly believed the repertory grid provided a \\"basis for a mathematics of psychological space\\"‚Äîa way to mathematically model any person's \\"psychological space\\".

The first Marquess served as Prime Minister of Great Britain. Origins This branch of the family descends from the Hon. John Petty-Fitzmaurice (originally John Fitzmaurice), second son of Thomas Fitzmaurice, 1st Earl of Kerry (see the Earl of Kerry for earlier history of the family), and his wife Anne, the daughter of the noted political economist Sir William Petty (whose wife had been created Baroness Shelburne and whose two sons had been created Baron Shelburne and Earl of Shelburne respectively, but who had died without heirs; see these titles for more information). In 1751 he succeeded to the estates of his maternal uncle Henry Petty, Earl of Shelburne, and assumed by Act of Parliament the surname of Petty in addition to FitzMaurice.Deed Poll Office: Private Act of Parliament 1750 (24 Geo. 2). c. 43 The same year he was created Baron Dunkeron and Viscount FitzMaurice in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1753 the earldom held by his uncle was revived when he was made Earl of Shelburne, in the County of Wexford, in the Peerage of Ireland. He later represented Wycombe in the House of Commons as a Whig. In 1760 he was created Baron Wycombe, of Chepping Wycombe in the County of Buckingham, in the Peerage of Great Britain, which gave him an automatic seat in the British House of Lords. Creation and descent The Earl of Shelburne was succeeded by his eldest son William Petty-FitzMaurice, 2nd Earl of Shelburne. He was a prominent statesman and served as Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1782 to 1783. The Prime Minister's brother, The Hon. Thomas FitzMaurice (1742-1793) of Cliveden, was also a fellow Member of Parliament. It was reported in 2012 that Thomas FitzMaurice's direct descendants included brothers Lieut. Osmund Fitzmaurice Bullock and Sir Christopher Bullock with Sir Christopher's wife - Lady Bullock (n√©e Barbara May Lupton) - being the second cousin of Olive Middleton (n√©e Lupton), the great grandmother of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. In 1784, William Petty-Fitzmaurice was created Viscount Calne and Calston, in the County of Wiltshire, Earl of Wycombe, of Chepping Wycombe, and Marquess of Lansdowne, in the County of Somerset, in the Peerage of Great Britain. Through his first wife Lady Sophia Carteret (1745‚Äì1771), only daughter of Robert Carteret, 3rd Earl Granville (see the Earl Granville 1715 creation), he acquired large estates, including Lansdowne Hill near Bath, from which he took his title of Marquess. However, he is better known to history under his former title of Earl of Shelburne. He sat as Whig Member of Parliament for Wycombe between 1786 and 1805. He was succeeded by his son from his first marriage to Lady Sophia Carteret, the second Marquess. His son, John Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 2nd Marquess of Lansdowne, died childless and was succeeded by his half-brother, the third Marquess. He was the son of the first Marquess's second marriage to Lady Louisa FitzPatrick. Known as Lord Henry Petty from 1784 to 1809, he was one of the most influential Whig politicians of the first half of the 19th century. In a ministerial career spanning over fifty years he served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1806 to 1807, as Home Secretary from 1827 to 1828, as Lord President of the Council from 1830 to 1834, 1835 to 1841 and 1846 to 1852, and as Minister without Portfolio from 1852 to 1858. He twice declined to become Prime Minister and refused the offer of a dukedom from Queen Victoria in 1857. In 1818 Lord Lansdowne also succeeded his cousin as fourth Earl of Kerry. His eldest son William Petty FitzMaurice, Earl of Kerry, was Member of Parliament for Calne but predeceased his father, without male issue. Lord Lansdowne was therefore succeeded by his second son, the fourth Marquess. He had already in 1856 been summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father's junior title of Baron Wycombe and served under Lord Palmerston as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from 1856 to 1858. He married as his second wife Emily Jane Mercer-Elphinstone-de Flahault, 8th Lady Nairne (see the Lord Nairne), eldest daughter of the French general and statesman Charles Joseph, comte de Flahaut, and his wife Margaret Nairne, 7th Lady Nairne. Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne He was succeeded by his eldest son from his second marriage, the fifth Marquess. Like his grandfather, he was a prominent statesman and had an equally long ministerial career. Lord Lansdowne was Governor-General of Canada from 1883 to 1888, Viceroy of India from 1888 to 1894, Secretary of State for War from 1895 to 1900, Foreign Secretary from 1900 to 1905, Co-Leader of the Conservative Party from 1911 to 1916 and also served in the war-time coalition government as Minister without Portfolio from 1915 to 1916. In 1895 he succeeded his mother as ninth Lord Nairne. His eldest son, the sixth Marquess, sat as Unionist Member of Parliament for West Derbyshire from 1908 to 1918 and was a Senator of the Irish Free State in 1922. On his death in 1936 he was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, the seventh Marquess, who was killed in action in 1944 during the Second World War, unmarried. As the third and youngest brother, Lord Edward Norman Petty-Fitzmaurice, had been killed in action only a week before, the Scottish lordship of Nairne was passed on to their eldest sister Katherine (see Lord Nairne for later history of this title). Lord Lansdowne was survived in the remaining titles by his first cousin, the eighth Marquess. He was the son of Major Lord Charles George Francis Mercer Nairne Petty-Fitzmaurice (1874‚Äì1914), second son of the fifth Marquess. Born George John Charles Mercer Nairne, he assumed by Decree of the Lord Lyon the additional surnames of Petty- Fitzmaurice in 1947. Lord Lansdowne sat on the Conservative benches in the House of Lords and served as Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from 1958 to 1962 and as Minister of State for Colonial Affairs from 1962 to 1964. As of 2014 the titles are held by his eldest son, the ninth Marquess, who succeeded in 1999. The courtesy title for the Lord Lansdowne's eldest son and heir apparent alternates between Earl of Kerry and Earl of Shelburne. The family seat is Bowood House, near Calne, Wiltshire. The family's former London residence was Lansdowne House in Berkeley Square.

The rioting began in Jaffa and spread to other parts of the country. The riot resulted in the deaths of 47 Jews and 48 Arabs. Another 146 Jews and 73 Arabs were wounded. The events Memorial for victims of the 1921 Jaffa riots, Petah Tikva On the night of 1 May 1921, the Jewish Communist Party (precursor of the Palestine Communist Party) distributed Arabic and Yiddish fliers calling for the toppling of British rule and the establishment of a \\"Soviet Palestine\\". The party announced its intention to parade from Jaffa to neighbouring Tel Aviv to commemorate May Day. On the morning of the parade, despite a warning to the 60 members present from one of Jaffa's most senior police officers, Toufiq Bey al-Said, who visited the party's headquarters, the march headed from Jaffa to Tel Aviv through the mixed Jewish-Arab border neighbourhood of Manshiyya. Another large May Day parade had also been organized for Tel Aviv by the rival socialist Ahdut HaAvoda group, with official authorization. When the two processions met, a fistfight erupted. Police attempted to disperse the about 50 communist protestors, and Muslims and Christians intervened to help the police against the Jews. A general disturbance quickly ensued and spread to the southern part of town. Hearing of the fighting and believing that Arabs were being attacked, the Arabs of Jaffa went on the offensive. Dozens of British, Arab, and Jewish witnesses all reported that Arab men bearing clubs, knives, swords, and some pistols broke into Jewish buildings and murdered their inhabitants, while women followed to loot. They attacked Jewish pedestrians and destroyed Jewish homes and stores. They beat and killed Jews in their homes, including children, and in some cases split open the victims' skulls. At 1:00 pm, an immigrant hostel run by the Zionist Commission and home to a hundred people who had arrived in recent weeks and days was attacked by the mob, and though the residents tried to barricade the gate, it was rammed open and Arabs attackers poured in. The stone-throwing was followed by bombs and gunfire, and the Jewish hostel residents hid in various rooms. When the police arrived, it was reported that they weren't shooting to disperse the crowd, but were actually aiming at the building. In the courtyard one immigrant was felled by a policeman's bullet at short-range, and others were stabbed and beaten with sticks. Five women fled a policeman firing his pistol; three escaped. A policeman cornered two women and tried to rape them, but they escaped him despite his shooting at them. A fourteen-year-old girl and some men managed to escape the building, but each was in turn chased down and beaten to death with iron rods or wooden boards. Yosef Haim Brenner The violence reached as far as Abu Kabir. The Jewish Yitzker family owned a dairy farm on the outskirts of the neighbourhood, in which they rented out rooms. At the time of the riots, Yosef Haim Brenner, one of the pioneers of modern Hebrew literature was living at the site. On May 2, 1921, despite warnings Yitzker and Brenner refused to leave the farm and were murdered, along with Yitzker's teenaged son, his son- in-law and two other renters. As in the previous year's Nebi Musa riots, the mob tore open their victims' quilts and pillows, sending up clouds of feathers. Some Arabs defended Jews and offered them refuge in their homes; many witnesses identified their attackers and murderers as their neighbours. Several witnesses said that Arab policemen had participated. High Commissioner Herbert Samuel declared a state of emergency, imposed press censorship, and called for reinforcements from Egypt. General Allenby sent two destroyers to Jaffa and one to Haifa. Samuel met with and tried to calm Arab representatives. Musa Kazim al-Husseini, who had been dismissed as Jerusalem's mayor on account of his involvement in the previous year's Nebi Musa riots, demanded a suspension of Jewish immigration. Samuel assented, and two or three small boats holding 300 Jews were refused permission to land, and were forced to return to Istanbul. At the same time, al-Husseini's nephew, Haj Amin al- Husseini, was appointed Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, a decision that later faced much criticism. An American architect of Russian Jewish origin, Peres Etkes, who worked for the Mandatory authorities, secretly transferred a stock of rifles from the British-run Jaffa armoury to supply Jewish forces in the riots.Oliver Holmes, 'Palestine: 1947 escape from British prison exposed as inside job,' The Guardian 30 August 2020 Fighting went on for several days and spread to nearby Rehovot, Kfar Saba, Petah Tikva, and Hadera. British aircraft dropped bombs \\"to protect Jewish settlements from Arab raiders.\\" Immediate aftermath The riot resulted in the deaths of 47 Jews and 48 Arabs. 146 Jews and 73 Arabs were wounded. Most Arab casualties resulted from clashes with British forces attempting to restore order.Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the disturbances in Palestine in May, 1921, with correspondence relating thereto (Disturbances), 1921, Cmd. 1540, p. 60. Thousands of Jewish residents of Jaffa fled for Tel Aviv and were temporarily housed in tent camps on the beach. Tel Aviv, which had been previously lobbying for independent status, became a separate city due in part to the riots. However Tel Aviv was still dependent on Jaffa, which supplied it with food, services, and was the place of employment for most residents of the new city. The victims were buried at the Trumpeldor Cemetery, established in Jaffa in 1902. The newspaper HaTzfira reported that meetings across the country had been postponed, all parties and celebration had been cancelled and schools closed for four days. The newspapers on May 3 appeared with black borders.Keepers of the City, Haaretz The newspaper Kuntress, whose author and co-editor Yosef Haim Brenner was one of the victims of the riots, published an article entitled Entrenchment. The article expressed the view that the Jews' outstretched hand had been spurned but that they would only redouble their efforts to survive as a self-reliant community. Some villages whose residents had participated in the violence were fined and a few rioters were brought to trial. When three Jews, including a policeman, were convicted of participating in the murder of Arabs, international outcry ensued. Although the Supreme Court ultimately acquitted them on grounds of self-defence, the incident served to continue the crisis of confidence between the Jewish community and the British administration. Three Arab men were tried for the murder of Brenner, but were acquitted due to reasonable doubt. Toufiq Bey al-Said, who resigned from the Jaffa police, was shot in the street; his assassin was dispatched by veterans of Hashomer in retribution for Brenner's murder, though another Jewish man was wrongly accused and acquitted. The Arab leaders submitted a petition to the League of Nations in which they expressed their demands for independence and democracy, noting that the Arab community contained sufficient educated and talented members to establish a stable representative democracy. Investigative Commission High Commissioner Sir Herbert Samuel established an investigative commission headed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in Palestine, Sir Thomas Haycraft (see Haycraft Commission of Inquiry). Its report confirmed the participation of Arab policemen in the riots and found the actions taken by the authorities adequate. The report angered both Jews and Arabs: it placed the blame on the Arabs, but said that, \\"Zionists were not doing enough to mitigate the Arabs' apprehensions.\\" The report concluded that, \\"the fundamental cause of the violence and the subsequent acts of violence was a feeling among the Arabs of discontent with, and hostility to, the Jews, due to political and economic causes, and connected with Jewish immigration.\\" . The report included an Appendix summarising the findings as follows.Haycraft Commission Report, Appendix A, p. 59 : The fundamental cause of the Jaffa riots and the subsequent acts of violence was a feeling among the Arabs of discontent with, and hostility to, the Jews, due to political and economic causes, and connected with Jewish immigration, and with their conception of Zionist policy as derived from Jewish exponents. : The immediate cause of the Jaffa riots on the 1st May was an unauthorised demonstration of Bolshevik Jews, followed by its clash with an authorised demonstration of the Jewish Labour Party. : The racial strife was begun by Arabs, and rapidly developed into a conflict of great violence between Arabs and Jews, in which the Arab majority, who were generally the aggressors, inflicted most of the casualties. : The outbreak was not premeditated or expected, nor was either side prepared for it ; but the state of popular feeling made a conflict likely to occur on any provocation by any Jews. : The general body of Jews is opposed to Bolshevism, and was not responsible for the Bolshevik demonstration.¬∑ : When the disturbance had once begun an already acute anti-Jewish feeling extended it into an anti-Jewish riot. A large part of the Moslem and Christian communities condoned it, although they did not encourage violence. While certain of the educated Arabs appear to have incited the mob, the notables on both sides, whatever their feelings may have been, aided the authorities to allay the trouble. : The police were, with few exceptions, half-trained and inefficient, in many cases indifferent, and in some cases leaders of or participators in violence. : The conduct of the military was admirable throughout. : The raids on five Jewish agricultural colonies arose from the excitement produced in the minds of the Arabs by reports of Arabs having been killed by Jews in Jaffa. In two cases unfounded stories of provocation were believed and acted upon without any effort being made to verify them. : In these raids there were few Jewish and many Arab casualties, chiefly on account of the intervention of the military. : This r√©sum√© is necessarily too condensed to be regarded as the expression of the conclusions of the Commission, except when read in conjunction with the report. Consequences In a speech in June 1921 on the occasion of the Royal birthday, Samuel stressing Britain's commitment to the second part of the Balfour Declaration of 1917, declared that Jewish immigration would be allowed only to the extent that it did not burden the economy. Those who heard the speech had the impression that he was trying to appease the Arabs at the Jews' expense, and some Jewish leaders boycotted him for a time. The Palestine government imposed fines on Arab villages and tribes believed to have been collectively involved in the riot. They were Tulkarm, Kakon, Kalkilieh, Kafr Saba, the Wadi Hawareth Bedouin and the Abu Kishik tribe.Official Gazette of the Government of Palestine, No. 56, December 1, 1921, page 9. New bloody riots broke out in Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem on November 2, 1921, when five Jewish residents and three of their Arab attackers were killed, which led to calls for the resignation of the city's commissioner, Sir Ronald Storrs.

History plat map of 1873 In 1769, the Spanish Portola expedition, first Europeans to see inland areas of California, traveled north through Sepulveda pass into the San Fernando Valley on August 5 and stayed two nights at a native village near what is now Los Encinos State Historic Park. Fray Juan Crespi, a Franciscan missionary travelling with the expedition, named the valley \\"El Valle de Santa Catalina de Bolonia de Los Encinos\\" (The Valley of St. Catherine of Bologna of the Holm Oaks).

Rancho Los Encinos (Ranch of Holm Oaks) was established in 1845 when a large parcel of former Mission San Fernando land was granted to three Mission Indians by governor Pio Pico. Many ranchos were created after the secularization of the California missions, which began in 1834. Encino derives its name from the rancho. Population The 2000 U.S. census counted 41,905 residents in the Encino neighborhood ‚Äî , among the lowest population densities for the city but average for the county. In 2008, the city estimated that the resident population had increased to 44,581. In 2000 the median age for residents was 42, considered old for city and county neighborhoods; the percentages of residents aged 50 and older were among the county's highest. \\"Encino,\\" Mapping L.A., Los Angeles Times The neighborhood was considered \\"not especially diverse\\" ethnically within Los Angeles, with a high percentage of white residents. The breakdown was whites, 80.1%; Latinos, 8.5%; Asians, 4.9%; blacks, 2.4%; and others, 4.1%. Iran (30.1%) and Russia (6.4%) were the most common places of birth for the 32.8% of the residents who were born abroad‚Äîan average percentage for Los Angeles. The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $78,529, considered high for the city. The percentage of households that earned $125,000 and up was high for Los Angeles County. The average household size of 2.3 people was low when compared to the rest of the city and the county. Renters occupied 38.4% of the housing stock and house- or apartment-owners held 61.6%. The percentages of divorced residents and of widowed men and women were among the county's highest. In 2000 military veterans amounted to 10.6% of the population, a high rate for the county.

Los Encinos State Historic Park features historic buildings, a small museum, and picnic grounds. In 2009 it faced closure due to California's budget crisis. However, the Park remains open today. The Sepulveda Basin Recreation Area is a large area with multiple golf courses, tennis courts, soccer fields, baseball diamonds, bike paths, and a lake bordered by about 2,000 Pink Cloud cherry trees that blossom in the spring and were donated anonymously. Encino Park was founded around 1937 and still draws youngsters to its playgrounds, as well as visitors to its basketball courts and two lighted tennis courts. For over a millennium, the area known as Encino was the home of a massive California live oak known as the Encino Oak Tree. It is possible that Encino is named because of this particular tree. (Encino is the Spanish word for \\"evergreen\\" or \\"holm oak.\\") It was known for its size and longevity. The tree died on February 7, 1998, after an El Ni√±o storm felled it. Today there is a monument to the great tree at the corner of Ventura Boulevard and Louise Avenue where the Encino Oak once stood. In popular culture *Encino is a recurring location in the SpongeBob SquarePants series, where the character, Patchy the Pirate, takes residence in the neighborhood. In the special episode, Atlantis SquarePantis, Patchy stars in a subplot in which he had to return home to Encino to watch the new SpongeBob episode, but the neighborhood had disappeared.

This family descends from Roger Townshend, who in 1617 was created a baronet, of Raynham in the County of Norfolk, in the Baronetage of England. He later represented Orford and Norfolk in the House of Commons. His younger son, the third Baronet (who succeeded his elder brother), played an important role in the restoration of the monarchy after the Civil War and was also Member of Parliament for Norfolk.George Edward Cokayne Complete Baronetage Volume 1 1900 In 1661 he was created Baron Townshend, of Lynn Regis in the County of Norfolk, and in 1682 he was further honoured when he was made Viscount Townshend, of Raynham in the County of Norfolk. Both titles were in the Peerage of England. He was succeeded by his son, the second Viscount. He was a prominent statesman and served as Secretary of State for the Northern Department from 1714 to 1716 and from 1721 to 1730. Lord Townshend is also remembered for the agricultural reforms he undertook at his Norfolk estate and gained the nickname \\"Turnip Townshend\\". His eldest son, the third Viscount, briefly represented Great Yarmouth in the House of Commons. However, in 1723, during his father's lifetime, he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father's junior title of Baron Townshend (although he was styled \\"Lord Lynn\\", taken from the territorial designation of the barony, to distinguish him from his father). Lord Townshend later served as Lord Lieutenant of Norfolk. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth Viscount. He was a Field Marshal in the Army and served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and as Master-General of the Ordnance. In 1787 he was created Marquess Townshend in the Peerage of Great Britain. Lord Townshend married as his first wife Charlotte Compton, 16th Baroness Ferrers of Chartley and 7th Baroness Compton. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Marquess. He had already on his mother's death in 1770 succeeded in the baronies Ferrers of Chartley and Compton. In 1784, 23 years before he succeeded his father, he was created Earl of Leicester in the Peerage of Great Britain. His choice of title derived from his descent from Lady Lucy Sydney, daughter of Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester (a title which had become extinct in 1743). Lord Townshend later held office as Master of the Mint, as Joint Postmaster General and as Lord Steward of the Household. His son, the third Marquess, was childless. On his death in 1855 the earldom of Leicester became extinct while the baronies of Ferrers of Chartley and Compton fell into abeyance. He was succeeded in the other titles by his first cousin, the fourth Marquess. He was the son of Lord John Townshend, second son of the first Marquess. Lord Townshend was a Rear-Admiral in the Royal Navy and also sat as Member of Parliament for Tamworth. His son, the fifth Marquess, also represented Tamworth in Parliament (as a Liberal). the titles are held by the latter's great-grandson, the eighth Marquess, who succeeded his father in April 2010. Several other members of the Townshend family have also gained distinction. Charles Townshend, second son of the third Viscount, was a prominent statesman and orator and served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1766 to 1767. The politician Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney, after whom the town of Sydney, Australia, was named, was the son of the Hon. Thomas Townshend, second son of the second Viscount. Sydney's grandson was the Liberal politician John Townshend, 1st Earl Sydney. Charles Townshend, 1st Baron Bayning, was the son of the Hon. William Townshend, third son of the second Viscount. See also Roger Townshend, Admiral George Townshend, Lord Charles Townshend, Lord John Townshend, Lord Charles Townshend, Lord James Townshend, Charles Fox Townshend and Major-General Sir Charles Vere Ferrers Townshend. As Lord Townshend holds no titles with names different from his main title, the territorial designation from his viscountcy is used for his heir, who is styled Viscount Raynham. Between 1807 and 1855 the courtesy title was Earl of Leicester (although the title was not used from 1811 to 1855 as there was no heir apparent to the marquessate during this period) while from 1782 to 1855 the courtesy title used by the heir apparent to the earldom of Leicester was Lord Ferrers of Chartley (and consequently was not used from 1811 to 1855 as there was no heir apparent either to the earldom or marquessate). The current Marquess holds the subsidiary titles: Viscount Townshend, of Raynham in the County of Norfolk (created 1682); Baron Townshend, of Lynn Regis in the County of Norfolk (created 1661); Townshend Baronet, 'of Raynham in the County of Norfolk' (created 1617), all of which in the Peerage of England. As noted above, due to being of the same name as the primary title, the Viscountcy has been called \\"Viscount Raynham\\" and the Barony \\"Baron Lynn\\".

Directed by Joseph Losey, it was the second of three collaborations between Pinter and Losey, the others being The Servant (1963) and The Go-Between (1970). At the 1967 Cannes Film Festival, it won the award for Grand Prix Sp√©cial du Jury. It also won the prestigious Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association. Plot Stephen, a married Oxford tutor in his forties, has two students: the rich and likeable William, of whom he is fond, and a beautiful, enigmatic Austrian named Anna, whom he secretly covets. William also fancies Anna and hopes to know her better. Stephen, while his wife is away having their third child, looks up an old flame in London and they sleep together. Returning home, he finds his pushy colleague Charley has broken in and is using the house for sex with Anna. Her tryst discovered, she tells Stephen privately she is getting engaged to William. Excited at his good fortune, William says he will call round to Stephen's house after a party that night. As William is too drunk to drive, Anna takes the wheel, but she crashes the car outside Stephen's gate. Upon finding the accident and William dead, Stephen pulls the deeply shaken Anna from the wreckage and hides her upstairs while he calls the police. When they have gone, he forces himself on her while she is still in shock, then takes her back to her room at the university. He comes by in the morning to find a bemused Charley, who cannot prevent Anna from packing to go back to Austria.

The crowning metaphor of the film comes when we see a dazed but unhurt Anna crushing her dying fianc√© beneath her high-heeled shoe as she steps on his face while trying desperately to climb out of the overturned car. Reception The film confused many viewers who were not sure what it meant. \\"It's obvious what Accident meant\\", said Stanley Baker, who acted a lead role in the film. \\"It meant what was shown on the screen.\\" Baker did concede of Joseph Losey's filmmaking that, \\"One of Joe's problems is that he tends to wrap things up too much for himself. I think that 75% of the audience didn't realise that Accident was a flashback.\\" In his review upon the film's release, New York Times critic Bosley Crowther was unimpressed, calling the film \\"a sad little story of a wistful don\\" that was \\"neither strong drama nor stinging satire\\". More recently, the film has been called a \\"masterpiece\\" by Boston Globe critic Peter Keogh. Financially the film performed poorly. In 1973 Losey said it was \\"officially in bankruptcy.\\" References Notes Further reading *Billington, Michael (2007) Harold Pinter.

Tephra horizons in south-central Iceland: The thick and light-coloured layer at the centre of the photo is rhyolitic tephra from Hekla. Volcanologists also refer to airborne fragments as pyroclasts. Once clasts have fallen to the ground, they remain as tephra unless hot enough to fuse together into pyroclastic rock or tuff. Tephrochronology is a geochronological technique that uses discrete layers of tephra‚Äîvolcanic ash from a single eruption‚Äîto create a chronological framework in which paleoenvironmental or archaeological records can be placed. When a volcano explodes, it releases a variety of tephra including ash, cinders, and blocks. These layers settle on the land and, over time, sedimentation occurs incorporating these tephra layers into the fossil record. Often, when a volcano explodes, biological organisms are killed and their remains are buried within the tephra layer. These fossils are later dated by scientists to determine the age of the fossil and its place within the fossil record. A 2007 eruptive plume at Mount Etna produced volcanic ash, pumice, and lava bombs. Overview Rocks from the Bishop tuff, uncompressed with pumice on left; compressed with fiamme on right Tephra is unconsolidated pyroclastic material produced by a volcanic eruption. It consists of a variety of materials, typically glassy particles formed by the cooling of droplets of magma, which may be vesicular, solid or flake-like, and a varying proportions of crystalline and mineral components originating from the mountain and the walls of the vent. As the particles fall to the ground, they are sorted to a certain extent by the wind and gravitational forces and form layers of unconsolidated material. The particles are further moved by ground surface or submarine water flow. The distribution of tephra following an eruption usually involves the largest boulders falling to the ground quickest, therefore closest to the vent, while smaller fragments travel further ‚Äì ash can often travel for thousands of miles, even circumglobal, as it can stay in the stratosphere for days to weeks following an eruption. When large amounts of tephra accumulate in the atmosphere from massive volcanic eruptions (or from a multitude of smaller eruptions occurring simultaneously), they can reflect light and heat from the sun back through the atmosphere, in some cases causing the temperature to drop, resulting in a temporary \\"volcanic winter\\". The effects of acidic rain and snow, the precipitation caused by tephra discharges into the atmosphere, can be seen for years after the eruptions have stopped. Tephra eruptions can affect ecosystems from miles to kilometers depending on the size of the eruption. Classification Tephra fragments are classified by size: Volcanic breccia in Jackson Hole. * Ash - particles smaller than 2 mm (0.08 inches) in diameter * Lapilli or volcanic cinders - between 2 and 64 mm (0.08 and 2.5 inches) in diameter * Volcanic bombs or volcanic blocks - larger than 64 mm (2.5 inches) in diameter The use of tephra layers, which bear their own unique chemistry and character, as temporal marker horizons in archaeological and geological sites, is known as tephrochronology. Etymology The word \\"tephra\\" and \\"pyroclast\\" both derive from Greek: tephra means \\"ash\\",. while the word pyroclast is derived from the Greek (pyr), meaning \\"fire\\",. and (klastos), meaning \\"broken in pieces\\"..  Environmental impacts  The release of tephra into the troposphere impacts the environment physically and chemically. Physically, volcanic blocks damage local flora and human settlements. Ash damages communication and electrical systems, coats forests and plant life reducing photosynthesis, and pollutes groundwater. Tephra changes below and above ground air and water movement. Chemically, tephra release can impact the water cycle. Tephra particles can cause ice crystals to grow in clouds which increases precipitation. Nearby watersheds and the ocean can experience elevated mineral levels, especially iron, which can cause explosive population growth in plankton communities. This, in turn, can result in eutrophication.  Disciplines and fossil record  In addition to tephrochronology, tephra is used by a variety of scientific disciplines including geology, paleoecology, anthropology, and paleontology, to date fossils, identify dates within the fossils record, and learn about prehistoric cultures and ecosystems. The carbonatite ash found in tephra serves as a fossilization catalyst burying and preserving fossils and tephra blocks near the site of the eruption. Under certain conditions, volcanic blocks can be preserved for billions of years and can travel up to 400 km away from the eruption. Volcanic eruptions around the world have provided valuable scientific information on local ecosystems and ancient cultures. Volcanoes The Mt.Saint Helens National Volcanic Monument after the 1980 eruption. Chait√©n volcano lava dome, Chile: The circular dome is brown and is surrounded by an ash covered landscape.  Africa  Africa's volcanoes have had a strong impact on the fossil record. Geographically, a part of Africa, El Hierro, a shield volcano, is located off the coast of El Hierro Island, the newest and smallest of the Canary Islands, The most recent El Hierro eruption occurred underwater, in 2011, and caused earthquakes and landslides throughout the Canary Islands. Instead of ash, floating rocks, restingolites, are released after every eruption. After the 2011 eruption, fossils of single- celled marine organisms were found in the restingolites verifying the origin theory that Canary Island growth comes from a single buoyant jet of magma from the Earth's core instead of cracks in the ocean floor. This is reflected in the decreasing age of the islands east to west from Fuerteventura to El Hierro. There are about 60 volcanoes in Ethiopia, located in east Africa. In Southern Ethiopia, the Omo Kibish Rock Formation is composed of layers of tephra and sediment. Within these layers, several fossils have been discovered. In 1967, 2 Homo sapien fossils were discovered in the Omo Kibish Formation by Richard Leaky, a paleoanthropologist. After radiocarbon dating, they were determined to be 195 thousand years old. Other mammals discovered in the formation include Hylochoerus meinertzhageni (forest hog) and Cephalophus (antelope).  Antarctica  Antarctica has a unique volcanic history. Today, volcanic activity occurs on islands located off the coast of Antarctica. One of the most active islands is Ross Island which has 4 volcanoes: Mount Erebus, Mount Terror, Mount Bird, and Mount Haddington. The most active of these four volcanoes is Mount Erebus, a stratovolcano, which has been continuously erupting since 2019 and is most famous for its lava lake. About 252 million years ago, the Permian-Triassic extinction event marked the transition between the Paleozoic era and Mesozoic era. This event included repeated meteor strikes which produced large volcanic eruptions releasing large quantities of methane gas into the atmosphere. During this time, Antarctica was still attached to South America. When the volcanoes erupted, whole forests growing in Antarctica were covered in lava. In 2015, a group of researchers led by Erik Gulbranson, professor at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee, discovered the Allan Hills fossil forest which dates back to the Triassic Period, about 252 to 200 million years ago. Many fossil forests have been found throughout Antarctica and are of interest to scientists around the world.  Asia  In Asia, several volcanic eruptions are still influencing local cultures today. In North Korea, Paektu Mountain, a stratovolcano, first erupted in 946 AD and is a religious site for locals. It last erupted in 1903. In 2017, new fossil evidence was discovered that determined the date of Paektu Mountain's first eruption, which had been a mystery. A team of scientists directed by Dr. Clive Oppenheimer, British volcanologist, discovered a larch trunk embedded within Paektu Mountain. After radiocarbon dating, the larch was determined to be 264 years old which coincides with the 946 AD eruption. Its tree rings are being studied and many new discoveries are being made about North Korea during that time. In northeastern China, a large volcanic eruption in the early Cretaceous caused the fossilization of an entire ecosystem known as the Jehol Biota when powerful pyroclastic flows inundated the area. The deposits include many perfectly preserved fossils of dinosaurs, birds, mammals, reptiles, fish, frogs, plants, and insects.  Australia  Australia's newly discovered prehistoric volcanoes are of interest to scientists worldwide because, at present, they are the oldest in Australia. There are only 2 active volcanoes in Australia, one located on Heard Island and McDonald Island. However, in 2019, about 100 prehistoric volcanoes were discovered underneath the Cooper- Eromanga Basins by teams of scientists from the University of Adelaide in Australia and the University of Aberdeen in Scotland. These volcanoes date back to the Jurassic Period, 160 to 180 million years ago. Researchers are excited about discovering more volcanoes underneath Australia and learning more about Australia's landscape during the Jurassic Period.  Europe  Europe's volcanoes provide unique information about the history of Italy. Mount Vesuvius, a stratovolcano, last erupted in March 1944, located in southern Italy. In 79 AD, Mount Vesuvius erupted covering the city of Pompeii in molten lava, ash, pumice volcanic blocks, and toxic gases. The entire eruption lasted 12 to 18 hours. Afterwards, everything was perfectly preserved and fossilized by the volcanic ash and has provided valuable information about the Roman culture. Also, in Italy, Stromboli volcano, a stratovolcano, last erupted in July 2019. In 2013, a team of researchers led by Ingrid Smet and Dr. Tom Pfeiffer, volcanologists, discovered dinosaur fossil footprints, from Diplodocus hallorum, in thick layers of ash.  North America  Several volcanic eruptions have been studied in North America. On 18 May 1980, Mt. Saint Helens, a stratovolcano, in Washington state erupted spreading five hundred million tons of tephra ash across Washington, Montana and Idaho causing earthquakes, rockslides, and megatsunami which severely altered the topography of nearby areas. The effects of the Mt. Saint Helens eruption was felt as far away as Yellowstone National Park, where eruption related flooding caused trees to collapse and wash into lake beds where they fossilized. Nearby forests were flooded, removing bark, leaves, and tree limbs. In 2006, the Augustine Volcano in Alaska erupted generating earthquakes, avalanches, and projected tephra ash approximately two hundred and ninety kilometers away. This dome volcano is over forty thousand years old and has erupted 11 times since 1800.  South America  In South America, there are several historic active volcanoes. In southern Chile, the Chait√©n volcano erupted in 2011 adding 160 meters to its rim. Prehistoric weapons and tools, formed from obsidian tephra blocks, were dated at 5,610 years ago and were discovered 400 km away. Due to the location of the subduction zone of the eastern Pacific's Nazca Plate, there are twenty one active volcanoes in southern Peru. In 2006, fossils, found under a layer of volcanic ash in Peru, were excavated by a team of paleontologists led by Mark D. Uhen, professor at George Mason University. The fossils were identified as 3 different types of archaeocetes, prehistoric whales, and are older than 36.61 million years which, as of 2011, makes them the oldest whale fossils discovered.

The name is believed to come from felfel, the Arabic for a peppercorn. Environment Filfla has an area of just with a coast of and is a crumbling flat-topped limestone plateau surrounded by high cliffs. Three species of seabirds breed on the islet: the European storm petrel (with an estimated 5000 - 8000 pairs), Cory's shearwater (c. 200 pairs) and yellow-legged gull (c. 130 pairs). The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International, principally because of the storm petrel colony. A type of wall lizard (Podarcis filfolensis ssp. filfolensis) and door snail (Lampedusa imitatrix gattoi) are endemic to Filfla. A large wild leek, growing up to high, also occurs. Access to Filfla is only possible for educational or scientific purposes and visitors must get prior permission from the Malta Environment and Planning Authority. History The island of Filfla was possibly sacred to the neolithic inhabitants of Malta, who built the temples of ƒ¶aƒ°ar Qim and Mnajdra on the Maltese coast opposite the islet. The only known permanent structure on the island was a chapel built inside a cave in 1343, which was destroyed by an earthquake in 1856 that also sank part of the island. A map of Malta dating back to 1798 shows a fort, a lighthouse and a monastery with a chapel on Filfla. Until 1971 the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force used the island for target practice, and spent cartridges from these bombardments can still be found on Filfla today. It became a bird reserve in 1980. The Filfla Natural Reserve Act, enacted in 1988, provided for further restrictions on access and use, including a prohibition on fishing within one nautical mile (1.9 km) around the island due to the possibility of encountering unexploded ordnance. Maltese Government notice 173 of 1990 once again permitted fishing within the one mile zone.http://www.um.edu.mt/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/43845/9..Marine_Protected_Areas_in_the_Maltese_Islands_1999.pdf Filfla was invoked in a territorial dispute over the continental shelf between Libya and Malta. The case was adjudicated by the International Court of Justice in 1985 essentially by ignoring the islet from the calculations.CASE CONCERNING THE CONTINENTAL SHELF (LIBYAN ARAB JAMAHIRIYA/MALTA) Judgment of 3 June 1985 Legends The creation story of Filfla is linked to the legends surrounding the formation of Il-Maqluba. Maltese legend recounts that the area that now forms Il-Maqluba was inhabited by people who lived such dissolute lives that a neighbour warned them against their sinful ways, without them taking notice. God therefore wished to punish the sinners by engulfing the hamlet, saving only the wise neighbour. Angels are then said to have thrown a fragment of the hamlet into the sea, creating the isle of Filfla.

The neighborhood is named after its colonial Spanish-Mexican land grantee, Jos√© Vicente Feliz, and, along with present-day Griffith Park, makes up the original Rancho Los Feliz land concession. While many who migrated to the area over the years pronounce the name of the neighborhood as (), in recent years, a number of residents have reverted to using the original pronunciation (\\"Los Feh-LEES\\"), Spanish for \\"the ones from the Feliz family\\", feliz meaning happy in English. Geography Deodar trees Los Feliz encompasses several smaller but distinct areas, including the Los Feliz Hills and Los Feliz Estates (north of Los Feliz Boulevard), Laughlin Park, Los Feliz Village, Los Feliz Square, Los Feliz Knolls, and Franklin Hills. According to the Mapping L.A. project of the Los Angeles Times, Los Feliz is part of Central Los Angeles. It is flanked on the north by Griffith Park, on the northeast by Atwater Village, on the southeast by Silver Lake, on the south by East Hollywood, and on the northwest by Hollywood and Hollywood Hills. Los Feliz is situated near the 101 and the 5 freeways in Hollywood and Atwater Village respectively. \\"Central L.A.\\", Mapping L.A., Los Angeles Times\\"Northeast L.A.\\", Mapping L.A., Los Angeles Times Its boundaries are the Griffith Park line between Fern Dell Drive and Riverside Drive on the north; the Los Angeles River on the east; Hyperion Avenue and Griffith Park Boulevard on the southeast; Fountain Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard on the south; and Western Avenue, Los Feliz Boulevard, and Fern Dell Drive on the west and northwest.\\"Los Feliz\\", Mapping L.A., Los Angeles TimesThe Thomas Guide: Los Angeles County, 2004, pages 593 and 594 Population Shakespeare Bridge over the Franklin Hills in the Los Feliz district General The 2000 U.S. census counted 35,238 residents in the 2.61-square-mile neighborhood‚Äîan average of 13,512 people per square mile, among the highest population densities in Los Angeles County. In 2008 the city estimated that the population had increased to 36,933. The median age for residents was 36, older than in the city as a whole; the percentage of residents aged 65 and older was among the county's highest. The neighborhood was highly diverse ethnically. The breakdown was whites, 57.6%; Latinos, 18.7%; Asians, 13.5%; blacks, 3.7%, and others, 6.6%. Armenia (25.3%) and Mexico (9.4%) were the most common places of birth for the 44.5% of the residents who were born abroad, a high ratio compared to the rest of Los Angeles. The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $50,793, about the same as the rest of Los Angeles, but a high rate of households earned $20,000 or less per year. The average household size of two people was low for the city of Los Angeles. Renters occupied 75.5% of the housing stock, and house or apartment owners the rest. The percentages of never-married men (50.2%) and never-married women (37.2%) were among the county's highest, as was the percentage of widowed women (10.1%). Los Feliz Hills The area north of Los Feliz Boulevard below Griffith Park is commonly referred to as the Los Feliz Hills. The Los Feliz Hills contain multimillion- dollar homes and have been known for the large share of their inhabitants being involved in creative pursuits. The mean household income is $196,585.Higley1000.com History Colonel Griffith, grantee of the Los Feliz family Native Americans Long before the Spanish settlers arrived to settle near the banks of the Los Angeles River, Native Americans were the only inhabitants. It is estimated that the first Native Americans came to the area approximately 10,000 years ago. The Native Americans established villages, known as rancherias, throughout the countryside. One of these settlements was within the boundaries of what was to become Rancho Los Feliz. Archeological surveys have found evidence of a substantial rancheria that existed in the mouth of Fern Dell Canyon in Griffith Park. The traditional name of this village is not known, but the inhabitants were Gabrielinos. This name was given by the Spanish because of the Native Americans' association with the San Gabriel Mission. When Gaspar de Portol√† traveled through the vicinity in 1769, his expedition encountered members of this village. Land grants The Rancho Los Feliz, one of the first land grants in California, was granted to Corporal Jos√© Vicente Feliz. An old adobe house built in the 1830s by his heirs still stands on Crystal Springs Drive in Griffith Park. Other sections of the rancho were developed and became the communities of Los Feliz and Silver Lake. Griffith's legacy Rancho Los Feliz had a succession of owners after the Feliz family. One owner, Griffith J. Griffith, donated over half of the ranch to the city of Los Angeles. This ranch became one of the largest city-owned parks in the country. In 1882, Colonel Griffith acquired of Rancho Los Feliz. The Lick estate still owned the southwest portion of the rancho and there developed the Lick Tract, which later became a part of Hollywood. Griffith never served in any branch of the U.S. armed forces, but he was given the honorary title of colonel by influential friends in the California National Guard. The title remained a permanent fixture to his name. In 1900, there were only 23 properties in Los Feliz. Griffith died on July 6, 1919, at the age of 67. Griffith bequeathed $700,000 and his Los Feliz acreage to the city of Los Angeles to be used for additions to Griffith Park.

It boasts some of the best-known residential architecture in the city, including two homes designed by Frank Lloyd Wright‚Äîthe Ennis House and the Hollyhock House‚Äîand Richard Neutra's Lovell House. Mickey Mouse was \\"born\\" in Los Feliz: Walt Disney drew his first image of the now-legendary character in the garage of his uncle's house, on Kingswell Avenue between Vermont Avenue and Rodney Drive. Disney's first animation studio (now a photocopy store) was also on Kingswell Avenue, just down the street from his uncle's house and east of Vermont Avenue. Disney's second, larger studio (now a Gelson's supermarket) was at the corner of Griffith Park Boulevard and Hyperion Avenue, on the Silver Lake side of the Los Feliz ‚Äì Silver Lake boundary. Los Feliz was also home to many other early studios, such as D. W. Griffith's, which now houses The Prospect Studios (formerly known as First National-Warner Brothers and more recently ABC Television Center), at the intersection of Prospect Avenue and Talmadge Street. On Sunset Boulevard was Monogram Pictures (KCET public television), where early Charlie Chan movies were filmed, as well as Hurricane, starring Dorothy Lamour, and the camp classic Johnny Guitar. (The Western street from that movie remained until the mid-1980s, when KCET razed the set to make way for a parking structure.)

Los Feliz Village Los Feliz Village is the southern section of Los Feliz, home to most of the commercial storefronts in the district. It is centered on the thoroughfares of Vermont and Hillhurst Avenues and spans from approximately Prospect Avenue to Los Feliz Boulevard. There are several coffee shops, restaurants, and small clothing and vintage stores. Los Feliz Village Business Improvement District helps promote local businesses and has an annual street fair. In February 2014, a local shop called Dumb Starbucks was opened as a bit for the Comedy Central show Nathan for You in Los Feliz Village. It has gained notoriety as a parody of Starbucks. Nightlife The Brown Derby c. 1945 Los Feliz Village is home or in proximity to numerous bars and restaurants catering to nightlife. They are mostly on Hillhurst Avenue between Los Feliz Boulevard and Prospect Avenue, and on Vermont Avenue between Franklin Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard. Some were classic dive bars in their heyday, frequented by the likes of Charles Bukowski, Lawrence Tierney, sundry working- class drunks, poets, artists, writers, and other creative types. The Derby, at Hillhurst Avenue and Los Feliz Boulevard, the last remaining location of the historic Brown Derby chain, was featured in the movie Swingers. It closed in 2009. The Dresden Room on Vermont Avenue, also featured in the film Swingers, has live entertainment by Marty and Elayne. (Marty and Elayne make brief, performing appearances in both Swingers and the fourth-season Mr. Show episode \\"Rudy Will Await Your Foundation\\".) Figaro Bistrot on Vermont Avenue was built in 1922. Disneyland Buena Vista Street, the entrance to the California Adventure theme park at the Disneyland Resort, is partly modeled after Los Feliz in the 1920s and 1930s. The Disney Buena Vista Street even includes a retail location called Los Feliz Five and Dime. Disney's Hyperion studio was situated in the Los Feliz area where a Gelson's Market now stands. In popular culture Several scenes in Double Indemnity are set in the Los Feliz area. in J.G. Quintel's series Close Enough, the main characters live in Los Feliz.

Founded in 1909, it includes the Southwest Museum, the world headquarters of the Self-Realization Fellowship, and Eldred Street, one of the three steepest streets in Los Angeles. History In the 19th century the area was part of Rancho San Rafael. Mount Washington was founded in 1909 as a subdivision laid out by real estate developer Robert Marsh. Marsh built the Mount Washington Hotel at the summit of Mount Washington, and the Los Angeles and Mount Washington Railway Company was soon established as a funicular railway up the hill as an alternative to constructing roads up the area's steep hillsides. The railway operated until January 1919. Mount Washington Railway By the late 2000s, the neighborhood attracted middle- and upper-income residents, mostly whites, Latinos, and Asians. The district is generally considered the most affluent area of the East Side, and also contains the region's largest concentration of non-Latino whites (though not as affluent as the neighboring cities of South Pasadena, San Marino, and southwest Pasadena; for instance, 30% of census tract 1851 (Mount Washington) has incomes of $100,000 or greater; while 35% of census tract 4806 (South Pasadena) has incomes of $100,000 or greater). The \\"beauty and the quirky nature of Mount Washington\\" has inspired songs. In recent years, many homebuyers have become attracted to the area as a relatively affordable alternative to the Westside. New York Times article, retrieved 20 May 2008 Population The 2000 U.S. census counted 12,728 residents in the 1.85-square-mile Mount Washington neighborhood‚Äîor 6,878 people per square mile, an average population density for the city. In 2008, the city estimated that the resident population had increased to 13,531. In 2008 the median age for residents was 33, about average for the city and the county. The percentage of never-married men (40.9%) was among the county's highest. \\"Mount Washington,\\" Mapping L.A., Los Angeles Times According to the Mapping L.A. project of the Los Angeles Times, based on the 2000 census, the neighborhood was \\"moderately diverse\\" ethnically, with a high percentage of Latino residents. The breakdown was Latinos, 61.2%; whites, 20.8%; Asians, 12.8% ; blacks, 2.6%; and others, 2.7%. Mexico (44.4%) and El Salvador (9.6%) were the most common places of birth for the 41.5% of the residents who were born abroad‚Äîan average figure for Los Angeles. Over the last decade, the demographics have been shifting. As of 2009, Mount Washington has no racial or ethnic group in a majority. According to the American Community Survey (2009), Mount Washington is 33% White, 3% Black, 47% Latino, 9% Asian, and 7% other (census tract 1851). The only census tract entirely within Mount Washington's boundaries is census tract 1851 (census tracts 1852 and 1862 are also in Mount Washington but also include surrounding neighborhoods). Census tract 1851 is on the east side of Mount Washington, and includes Moon Canyon Park and the Carlin G. Smith Recreation area; and it is extremely racially and ethnically diverse, even for Los Angeles. The 2000 census found that the median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $57,725, about average for the city. The average household size of 2.9 people was about the same as Los Angeles as a whole. Renters occupied 45.1% of the housing stock and house- or apartment- owners held 54.9%. Mount Washington (tract 1851) has a median household income of about $60,000; and 30% of its residents have a household income greater than $100,000 per year; neighboring census tracts shared with Mount Washington and other neighborhoods also have somewhat similar income data. Geography According to the Mapping L.A. project, Mount Washington is bordered on the north by Eagle Rock, on the east by Highland Park, on the south, southwest and west by Cypress Park and on the northwest by Glassell Park.

The $7 million in cash was the largest cash robbery in U.S. history at that time. On May 14, 1984, Gerena became the 386th fugitive to be placed on the FBI's Top Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list.

He then went to work and spent the rest of the day with co-workers James McKeon and Timothy Girard. At some point, Gerena removed McKeon's gun, handcuffed and tied up his two co-workers, and injected them with aspirin and water in order to further disable them, which did not work. He put $7,000,000 in the trunk of a car, then left with the money.

His signature soft focus style was called the \\"Hamilton Blur\\", which was erroneously thought to be achieved by smearing Vaseline on the lens of his camera. It was not created that way. Citation needed Hamilton's images became part of an \\"art or pornography\\" debate. In October 2016, French presenter Flavie Flament accused him of raping her in 1987, when she was 13 years old. In November 2016, French magazine L'Obs published anonymous accounts from three other former models claiming to have been raped by Hamilton. Hamilton issued a statement threatening legal action against his accusers and affirmed that he did not do anything wrong. On 25 November 2016, he was found dead in his Paris apartment by apparent suicide. Early life Hamilton was born in 1933 and grew up in London. His schooling was interrupted by World War II. As an evacuee, he spent some time in the countryside of Dorset, which inspired some of his work. After the war, Hamilton returned to London and finished his schooling. Career and later life His artistic skills began to emerge during a job at an architect's office. At age 20, he went to Paris, where he worked as graphic designer for Peter Knapp of Elle magazine. After becoming known and successful, he was hired away from Elle by Queen magazine in London as art director. Hamilton soon realised his love for Paris, however, and after returning there became the art director of Printemps, the city's largest department store. While Hamilton was still employed at Printemps, he began doing commercial photography, and the dreamy, grainy style of his images quickly brought him success. His photographs were in demand by other magazines such as R√©alit√©s, Twen and Photo. By the end of the 1960s, all of Hamilton's photographs appeared to have been snapped as if through a hazy mist. His further successes included dozens of photographic books with combined sales well into the millions; five feature films; countless magazine displays and museum and gallery exhibitions. His work was exhibited in every one of the first three years of The Photographers' Gallery, London, but were roundly condemned by Euan Duff for its \\"cliched pictorial symbolism, exploiting soft focus, pastel colours, country landscapes and old houses, old fashioned clothes and even white doves to give a phoney impression of heaIth-food ad naturalness; they are a sort of wholemeal stoneground pornography,\\" exhibited \\"because the gallery needs the money.\\"Euan Duff, 'Hamilton exhibition at the Photographers' Gallery,' The Guardian, Sat, Dec 1, 1973 p.10 In December 1977, Images Gallery‚Äîa studio owned by Bob Perskyhttps://www.forevermissed.com/robert-samuel-persky/lifestory#lifestory at 11 East 57th Street in Manhattan‚Äîshowed his photographs at the same time that Bilitishttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_ABT1bVeWY was released. At that time art critic Gene Thornton wrote in The New York Times that they reveal \\"the kind of ideal that regularly was expressed in the great paintings of the past\\". Hamilton has said that his work looks for \\"the candor of a lost paradise\\". In his book, Contemporary Photographers, curator Christian Caujolle wrote that Hamilton worked only with two fixed devices: \\"a clear pictorial intention and a latent eroticism, ostensibly romantic, but asking for trouble\\".David Hamilton, photographer known for nude images of girls, dies at 83, The New York Times, 28 November 2016 In 1995, Hamilton said that people \\"have made contradiction of nudity and purity, sensuality and innocence, grace and spontaneity. I try to harmonize them, and that's my secret and the reason for my success\\". Besides depicting young women, Hamilton composed photographs of flowers, men, landscapes, farm animals, pigeons and still lifes of fresh fruit. Several of his photographs look like oil paintings. Most of his work gives an impression of timelessness because of the absence of cars, modern buildings and advertisement boards. In 1976, Denise Coutt√®s explained Hamilton's phenomenal success on page 6 of The Best of David Hamilton. His images, she wrote, \\"express escapism. People can only escape from the violence and cruelty of the modern world through dreams and nostalgia\\". His soft focus style came back into fashion at Vogue, Elle, and other fashion magazines beginning around 2003. Hamilton had been in a relationship with Mona Kristensen (b. 1950), a model in many of his early photobooks who made her screen debut in Bilitis. Later, he married Gertrude Versyp, who co-designed The Age of Innocence, but they divorced amicably. Hamilton divided his time between Saint-Tropez and Paris. He had been enjoying a revival in popularity since 2005. In 2006, David Hamilton, a collection of captioned photographs, and Erotic Tales, which contains Hamilton's fictional short stories, were published. At the time of his death, Hamilton was working on another book, Monography of Montenegro. , the book is about to be realised. He was working with Jelica Bujic, who was his first and last photography assistant. Reception Much of Hamilton's work depicted early-teen girls, often nude, and he was the subject of some controversy including child pornography allegations, similar to those which the work of Sally Mann and Jock Sturges have attracted. For moral reasons, several of Hamilton's books were banned in South Africa. In the late 1990s, conservative Christian groups in America unsuccessfully protested against bookstores selling Hamilton's photography books. As Chris Warmoll, writing for The Guardian in 2005, commented, \\"Hamilton's photographs have long been at the forefront of the 'is it art or pornography?' debate.\\" Hamilton in 2012 In 2005, a man in the UK was convicted for being in possession of 19,000 images of children, including photos by Hamilton. The images were found to be in the lowest indecency rating. In response, Glenn Holland, Hamilton's spokesman, said: \\"We are deeply saddened and disappointed by this, as David is one of the most successful art photographers the world has ever known. His books have sold millions\\". In 2010, a man was convicted of level 1 child pornography for owning four books, including Hamilton's The Age of Innocence as well as Still Time by Sally Mann, which he purchased from a bookstore in Walthamstow, London. His conviction was overturned on appeal in 2011, with the judge calling his conviction \\"very unfair\\" and criticising the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for prosecuting him. The judge concluded that \\"If the [CPS] wishes to test whether the pictures in the books are indecent, the right way to deal with the matter is by way of prosecuting the publisher or retailer ‚Äì not the individual purchaser.\\" Sexual assault allegations On 22 October 2016, Thierry Ardisson, the host of the French talk-show Salut les Terriens! on TNT C8 channel, named Hamilton as the alleged rapist of now radio RTL presenter Flavie Flament. According to Flament, the acts were committed in 1987 when she was 13 years old, in Cap d'Agde, a naturist resort in H√©rault, southern France. She mentions them in her novel La consolation, a romanticised story based on her purported life experiences. After Flament publicly identified Hamilton, the book led to Hamilton being accused of being a predatory pedophile. Flament's brother has called certain revelations in her book into question. On 22 November 2016, Hamilton issued a statement threatening legal action against his accusers. When contacted by the French press agency AFP, Hamilton declared that he was not to blame. \\"I didn't do anything wrong,\\" he affirmed, while confirming only that he took a portrait of Flament, \\"29 or 30 years ago\\". Flament put the portrait on the cover of La consolation. On 17 November 2016, the weekly news magazine L'Obs published anonymous accounts by three other former models who claimed to have been raped by Hamilton. One day later, Flament confirmed that Hamilton was the rapist whom she had not identified in her book.  Death  On the evening of 25 November 2016, Hamilton's cleaning lady entered the apartment of the 83-year-old photographer at 41 Boulevard Montparnasse in southern Paris and found him dead with a plastic bag over his head and medications close at hand. The autopsy revealed that asphyxiation was the cause of death.

He was appointed Shadow Minister for Peace and Disarmament in November 2016.  Education and early career  Fabian Hamilton was born in London to a British Jewish family. His grandfather was a rabbi. His father Mario, a solicitor, and his mother Adrianne, a judge, were members of the Liberal Party, for which his father was several times an election candidate. He was educated at Brentwood School in Essex where he participated in the school's dramatic productions, playing a minor role in the Shakespeare play Julius Caesar alongside Douglas Adams and Griff Rhys Jones. He then attended the University of York where he was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree. He worked initially as a taxi driver for a year from 1978 before working as a graphic designer. From 1994 until his election to Parliament, he was a computer systems consultant with Apple Macintosh Computer Systems. He was elected as a councillor to the City of Leeds Council in 1987, stepping down in 1998. He was elected as the chairman of the Leeds West Constituency Labour Party in 1987.  Parliamentary career  Hamilton contested Leeds North East at the 1992 general election but was defeated by the sitting Conservative MP Timothy Kirkhope by 4,244 votes, gaining a 5.9% swing from the Conservative Party to Labour. Despite having achieved the highest Labour swing in the North of England, the constituency Labour Party voted, by a margin of one vote, in favour of an all-women shortlist. Hamilton was quoted by The Independent as saying: Leeds North-East made its selection on 1 July 1995, selecting Liz Davies, a barrister and councillor in the London Borough of Islington. Davies defeated four local women, two of whom were Leeds city councillors. Her selection was vetoed by the National Executive Committee, allegedly for her left-wing politics; unhappy with the situation, opponents took out an unsuccessful private prosecution against Hamilton under the Companies Act in connection with his printing business. Hamilton won the subsequent selection process. He was elected to the House of Commons at the 1997 general election when he defeated Kirkhope by 6,959 votes. He made his maiden speech on 23 June 1997, in which he explained that his constituency stretches from the inner- city Leeds district of Chapeltown all the way out to Harewood House, the stately home of the Earls of Harewood. He is said to be the first MP to hold a virtual surgery for constituents who can go to his constituency office while he is in London, and converse via webcam. He was a signatory of an open letter to the then-Labour Party leader Ed Miliband in January 2015 calling on the party to commit to oppose further austerity, take rail franchises back into public ownership and strengthen collective bargaining arrangements Hamilton was re-elected as the MP for Leeds North East at the 2019 General Election with a 17,089 majority. Middle East Hamilton is a signatory of the Euston Manifesto and of the statement of principles of the Henry Jackson Society a neoconservative foreign policy think tank. He supports Labour Friends of Israel and was critical of Ed Miliband's stance on the Israel-Gaza conflict in 2014.  Parliamentary offices  Fabian Hamilton with Labour leader Ed Miliband at the Royal Armouries in Leeds in 2011 In Parliament he served as a member of the Administration Select committee 1997‚Äì2001, and has been a member of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee since the 2001 general election. He is also the chairman of the all party groups on business services, prison health, and civil contingency, he also serves as the vice- chairman of the all-party Iran group. He also chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Tibet. On 7 January 2016, Hamilton was appointed a shadow Foreign Minister, outside the Shadow Cabinet. On 29 June 2016, Hamilton was appointed as Shadow Europe Minister to replace Pat Glass, who resigned over concerns about Corbyn's leadership. Hamilton resigned a few days later on 4 July 2016, saying that he was troubled by Corbyn's response to the Chakrabarti Inquiry into anti-Semitism. On 8 November 2016, Corbyn fulfilled a campaign pledge as Hamilton was appointed as Shadow Minister for Peace and Disarmament - the first time this role had been held. The role covers North Africa, the Middle East, North Korea and Labour Party policy on nuclear weapons. When elected Leader of the Labour Party, Sir Keir Starmer kept the role as Shadow Minister for Peace and Disarmament, with Hamilton continuing in the role.  Expenses scandal In 2009 The Daily Telegraph reported that Hamilton had incorrectly claimed ¬£3,000 on expenses for mortgage payments. In addition to the interest on the mortgage, which can be claimed as an expense, Hamilton claimed for interest on an equity release scheme on the house, which cannot. Hamilton responded in a statement that this was \\"a genuine mistake\\" and that the money was paid back when the error was discovered by the House of Commons Fees Office. The Telegraph also accused Hamilton of \\"flipping\\" his second home designation to decorate and furnish both his constituency home in Leeds and London flat. Hamilton defended his actions and accused the Daily Telegraph of \\"deliberately misrepresenting\\" him.  Personal life  He married Rosemary in 1980: they have two daughters and a son. He is a keen cyclist, and once cycled to Aachen, Germany, raising funds for the Funzi and Bodo Trust, a children's charity based in Kenya. He speaks fluent French. As a result of mergers, he has successively been a member of Graphical, Paper and Media Union, Amicus and Unite.

He contested Portsmouth South for the SDP at the 1983 general election but lost to the sitting Conservative MP Bonner Pink by 12,335 votes. Pink died on 6 May 1984, and Hancock was elected after being a candidate, again for the SDP, at the by-election by 1,341 votes. In his book Time To Declare, the SDP leader David Owen claimed that Hancock's victory prevented a Liberal attempt to subsume the SDP before the 1987 general election. However, Hancock later lost his seat in the 1987 general election to the Conservative David Martin by just 205 votes. He narrowly lost the seat to Martin again at the 1992 general election, this time by just 242 votes. He also contested the European Parliament seat of Wight and Hampshire South in 1994. He returned to parliament at the 1997 general election, defeating Martin by 4,327 votes and held the seat for the Liberal Democrats at each subsequent general election.\\"Portsmouth South\\", The Guardian (results in the constituency 1997‚Äì2010) He was promoted to the frontbench by Paddy Ashdown in 1997 as the spokesman on foreign and commonwealth affairs until 2000, when he was moved by Charles Kennedy to speak on the environment, transport and the regions, but following the 2001 general election, Hancock returned to the backbenches.

That is why I stood against him and ousted him. His research assistant, who provided secretarial support to the group, was incensed and walked out.\\" Hancock holds various positions on the Council of Europe, including a committee position on the Committee on the Honouring of Obligations and Commitments by Member States of the Council of Europe (Monitoring Committee). On 18 October 2011, amidst espionage allegations relating to his aide and mistress Katia Zatuliveter, Hancock resigned from his post on the defence select committee. (See below) Political views and stances Hancock has said that he will act to defend the government of Azerbaijan in the British Parliament. He says that he disapproves of criticism of President Ilham Aliyev's regime, and has stated that, in particular, he disapproves of the democratic opposition movement within Azerbaijan. In 2013 he voted against a critical report on political prisoners in Azerbaijan. Hancock has stated that he does not believe the Armenian Genocide actually happened, describing it as a \\"so-called genocide\\" based on \\"dubious historical\\" claims; in March 2010, he said: \\"Armenia is like a headless chicken that runs around in circles. They really do not know where to run.\\" Hancock is a patron of the Captive Animals Protection Society, a charity campaigning for an end to the use of animals in entertainment, including circuses, zoos, the exotic pet trade and the audio-visual industry. Hancock is a notable supporter of homoeopathy, having signed several early day motions in support of its continued funding on the National Health Service. Russian aide's arrest, espionage allegation and extra-marital affair On 8 August 2010, one of Hancock's parliamentary aides, Russian national Katia Zatuliveter, and her friend were questioned at Gatwick Airport on returning from celebrating her 25th birthday in Croatia. Hancock had met Zatuliveter in Strasbourg where she worked for the Council of Europe. She started working as an aide to Hancock in 2008, after having been an intern at the House of Commons for a while and undergoing security vetting. Until Hancock was ousted as chairman of the All-Party Group on Russia in June 2010, Zatuliveter had been the group's secretary, giving her direct access to all MPs with the greatest interest in Russia and legitimate reason to liaise with the Russian authorities;MI5 had been watching MP Mike Hancock's Russian aide for months The Times, 6 December 2010. according to sources at Westminster, Zatuliveter had access to Hancock's private emails, and virtually ran the UK-Russia group. Reportedly, Zatuliveter had been identified by MI5 (UK Security Service) when surveillance linked her to another person with close links to the Russian embassy in London; the latter was suspected of working for the SVR, Russia's foreign intelligence service. On 4 December 2010, it was reported that Zatuliveter was facing deportation in Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre, after she was arrested by the Metropolitan Police Service on behalf of MI5 and the Border and Immigration Agency on 2 December 2010, on suspicion of espionage, the police action having been approved by Home Secretary Theresa May. The incident happened in the wake of the uncovering and expulsion of ten Russian sleeper agents in the US in June 2010, including a young woman who had British citizenship, Anna Chapman. On 5 December 2010, Hancock confirmed the detention of Zatuliveter and advised the media that she was appealing against her potential deportation. In subsequent interviews on the same day, he called the espionage accusations \\"absolutely ludicrous\\" commenting further: \\"I have no reason to believe she did anything but act honourably during the time she was working for me. She is determined to fight her corner and she genuinely believes, and I back her 100%, that she has nothing to hide and has done nothing wrong. If she has, the (security) services are right. But they need to prove their point now.\\" The media quoted some of Hancock's former Council of Europe's liberal group colleagues as saying that in the 2000s Hancock would usually come to their regular private gatherings alongside a series of young Russian and Ukrainian women ‚Äì in spite of protests by some of those; Hancock's former colleagues said they had witnessed his assistants using the computers of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the liberal group secretariat, which were supposed to be protected by a password; apparently his assistants knew the password. Hancock denied claims by M√°ty√°s E√∂rsi that he had failed to declare all of his visits to Russia, saying that he did not know exactly how many trips he had made to Russia, as his passport had \\"fallen into the sea\\". It was also reported that Hancock had allegedly agreed to help another Russian national, a 25-year-old Ekaterina Paderina, stay in Britain after she ran into visa problems in the late 1990s. On 7 December 2010 Russia's Foreign Ministry described the affair as \\"vaudeville based on a threadbare spy plot\\" being whipped up by the UK media, which could \\"only be regarded with pity\\". On 9 December 2010, Katerina Zatuliveter filed an appeal against arrest and deportation to Russia; in a statement released by her lawyer Tessa Gregory, Zatuliveter said British authorities had failed to provide evidence of her work not being \\"conducive to national security\\"; of MI5 she said: \\"I fully cooperated with them when they questioned me. I have nothing to hide and was only doing my job as a parliamentary researcher.\\" Also on that day, Alexander Sternik, Russia's charg√© d'affaires said of Hancock: \\"Mike Hancock is one of those people who are known to have a balanced objective and sympathetic approach towards the modern Russia and its foreign policy.\\" Sternik also said that the Russian view of the affair was that Hancock was being targeted because he was a parliamentarian who \\"showed sympathy and understanding for the modern Russian state\\"; of Zatuliver's detention he said: \\"We have not received, although we insisted on this, any clarification as to the motives and the reasons that this detention was made.\\" At a Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) hearing on her case begun on 18 October 2011, Zatuliveter admitted to having had a four-year affair with Hancock. She also admitted that she had had affairs with a NATO official, a Dutch diplomat and a senior UN official. On 29 November 2011, the SIAC delivered its ruling that allowed the appeal; the SIAC's Open Judgment concluded: \\"Our conclusion, at least on the balance of probabilities, is that she was and is not a Russian agent. [...]\\"Open Judgment See ¬ß 62. The 2011 SIAC's ruling on Zatuliveter's appeal noted of her relationship with him: \\"The relationship with Mr Hancock was enduring and genuine on both sides.\\"Open Judgment See ¬ß 61. Indecent assault claim In October 2010 a complaint was made against Hancock of indecent assault, which Hampshire Police announced would not be pursued in December 2010 due to insufficient evidence.\\"MP Mike Hancock will not face charges over sex assault claims\\", The Guardian (Press Association), 22 December 2010 In February 2013, a civil suit against Hancock over the same complaint was filed. In September 2013 the police reopened their investigation, asking that a report for Portsmouth City Council, be handed over. Hancock was then still a Portsmouth councillor, as well as an MP for the city. The report was an investigation into whether Hancock had breached the Councillors Code of Conduct for Portsmouth City Council, the council suspended any action as a result of the report until all other proceedings have concluded. The Police decided after considering the report that Hancock would face no charges in relation to the complaint. In January 2014, Hancock was suspended from the Liberal Democrats after the party nationally reviewed the report commissioned by Liberal Democrat run Portsmouth City Council which had found \\"prima facie evidence of his unwelcome sexual approaches\\" to his constituent.Rajeev Syal and Daniel Foggo \\"MP Mike Hancock 'made unwelcome sexual approaches', lawyer concludes\\", The Guardian, 23 December 2013 The report, which has not been officially published, had become available to The Guardian in December 2013. The civil case was scheduled to come to trial in mid-June 2014, but a settlement between the parties emerged on 11 June. A week later, when details of the out of court settlement became public knowledge, Hancock apologised to his constituent (known only under the pseudonym of Annie) via a statement issued by the complainant's solicitors at the High Court in London. Any compensation paid to the complainant was not made publicly known.David Barrett \\"Disgraced MP Mike Hancock apologises for 'degrading' relationship with constituent\\", The Telegraph, 18 June 2014 In part, his statement says: \\"I understand that you felt degraded.

Harris began his career at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital in 1991 as a Pre-Registration House Officer (junior doctor). A year later, he moved to the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, specialising in acute medicine and surgery. In 1994 Harris moved to Oxfordshire Health Authority, becoming an honorary specialist registrar in public health and working on issues to do with NHS staffing and training. Harris held the position of local British Medical Association representative and negotiator from 1992 to 1994, following which he was elected to the BMA's National Council. Harris is a humanist, and a patron of Humanists UK. He was also a vice-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Humanist Group, before being unseated at the 2010 general election. In addition, he is an honorary associate of the National Secular Society, and the Patron of the Oxford Secular Society. Harris lists his interests as football, bridge and chess. Political career=Election to Parliament He was first elected to the House of Commons at the 1997 General Election for Oxford West and Abingdon. The seat had previously been held by Conservative John Patten, a former Cabinet minister. Harris gained the seat for the Liberal Democrats with a majority of 6,285, making his maiden speech on 21 May 1997,Debate Text for 21 May 1997 ‚Äì Hansard and remained the MP there until 2010. Promotion to the frontbench In parliament, he was made a frontbench spokesman on Health in 1997 by Paddy Ashdown. Following the election of Charles Kennedy as party leader in 1999, Harris became spokesman on Higher Education and Women's issues. He was promoted to the Liberal Democrat shadow cabinet following the 2001 general election as Shadow Secretary of State for Health, but stood down in 2003 to care for his girlfriend Liz O'Hara who had been diagnosed with terminal glioblastoma multiforme. Following the 2005 general election, Harris returned to the frontbench team as spokesman on Science, a position he held until his defeat in the 2010 general election. Harris was a member of the education and employment select committee between 1999 and 2001. He was then a member of the select committees for science and technology between 2003 and 2010, and for human rights between 2005 and 2010. Evan Harris is a member of the centre-left Beveridge Group within the Liberal Democrats,About us ‚Äì The Beveridge Group 28 October 2007 and was Honorary President of the Liberal Democrats Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender equality organisation (LGBT+ Liberal Democrats) from 2000 to 2012. In parliament, he served on many party groups, including the kidney group (as chairman); mental health; science; refugees; equality; and AIDS group. Expenses Harris was initially alleged to have profited from the sale of his second home by The Daily Telegraph during the expenses scandal. However, following Harris's response, the Telegraph withdrew its allegations. Sir Thomas Legg, the auditor brought in by the House of Commons, wrote to Harris to say that there were no problems with his expenses. Campaigns Harris is pro-choice on abortion, and supports the right of mentally competent, terminally ill people to take their own lives under certain circumstances. This has led to criticism from pro-life and Church leaders, such as George Pitcher. Harris has also spoken in support of medical research involving animals, including that carried out at Oxford University. Notably, he joined Pro-Test's Oxford march in February 2008. This led animal rights activist Keith Mann to stand against Harris in the 2010 general election, during which he referred to Harris as \\"Dr Death\\". Harris is a vocal backer of reform of defamation laws in the United Kingdom. He notably supported Simon Singh in his libel case against the British Chiropractic Association, saying \\"For every Simon Singh who wins there are hundreds of writers who never dare publish or who give up their legal battle because they cannot risk the cost of losing. That is why all the political parties must be held to their promises take action [to reform defamation law]\\". In 2009, Evan Harris was awarded (with Lord Avebury) the National Secular Society's Secularist of the Year Award in recognition of his role in the abolition of the common law offence of blasphemous libel. Defeat in 2010 general election In the 2010 general election, Harris was defeated by the Conservative candidate Nicola Blackwood. Harris received 23,730 votes to Blackwood's 23,906 ‚Äì a margin of 176 votes. This equated to a 6.9% swing from the Liberal Democrats to the Conservatives. Several political commentators commented that this was one of the most surprising results of the general election ‚Äì given Harris' high-profile position as a shadow minister and the size of his existing majority. =Pre-election campaign= For a number of years before the 2010 general election Harris' views on various social and theological matters had led to criticism within certain parts of the media. Christian conservatives criticised Harris, including Damian Thompson and Cristina Odone. In the final weeks of the 2010 campaign, leaflets were distributed by Keith Mann, a candidate for the Animal Protection Party, attacking Harris as 'Dr Death', and criticising him for his support for animal testing, abortion, secularisation, and other issues. Further leaflets were distributed by the unaffiliated Reverend Lynda Rose, also referring to Harris as 'Dr Death', and criticising him for his secularism, support for abortion, embryo research and assisted suicide. In contrast to these criticisms, Harris received support from a number of humanist and atheist figures, including Ben Goldacre, Simon Singh and Dave Gorman. Stephen Fry added his support, saying of Harris: \\"[Harris is] by far and away the most persuasive and impressive parliamentarian in the cause of good and open science and enquiry that we have had in the past decade. He has been central to mould-breaking and inspirational multiparty cooperation in issues of scientific concern since 1997.\\" =Boundary changes= Before the 2010 general election, Harris's seat of Oxford West and Abingdon had its boundaries changed, moving the central Oxford wards of Carfax and Holywell, composed primarily of students of the University of Oxford, to the Oxford East constituency. In return the constituency gained a ward each from Wantage and Witney. These changes reduced Harris' notional majority from 7683 to 5525 votes, or 11.3%. =Reactions to election defeat= Responses to the election result varied. Harris' defeat was lamented by a number of commentators as a 'loss for science'. However, Harris' defeat was also celebrated by some conservative Christians, including Christian Concern For Our Nation, and George Pitcher who described it as \\"the best result of the election\\". The causes of the electoral result remain disputed. Richard Dawkins, posting on his site, wondered whether the religious criticisms of Harris had \\"caused Evan Harris to lose votes\\" or \\"gain them\\", noting that the answer to this would reflect the true extent of secular thought in Britain. However, post-election analysis in the Oxford Mail suggested that Harris' strident secular opinions appeared to have \\"alienated a sufficiently large percentage of the electorate to lose what was considered a relatively safe seat for the Liberal Democrats\\".Oxford Mail 7 May 2010 It detailed that while the Liberal Democrats had nationally gained a 1% swing in their favour, in the Oxford West constituency there had been a 6.9% swing away from the party to the Conservatives. Although 2001 census figures show that Oxford had the 10th highest proportion of people in England and Wales who listed themselves as having no religion, the census also showed that 76.1% of those surveyed did not class themselves as having no religion.http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/38UC-A.asp Career after 2010 general election defeat From August 2010 Harris has been writing a blog on science policy for The Guardian. On 18 September 2010, Harris had an article published on The Guardian website called 'A secularist manifesto'. This was in turn critiqued by Dr Jonathan Chaplin, who wrote that 'the manifesto contains troubling elements, which serve to undermine his professed support for the right to manifest religious belief.' On 17 November 2010, Harris was elected as one of the three vice-chairs on the Liberal Democrats' Federal Policy Committee.

Biography Born at Schlo√ü Ehrenburg in Coburg, he was the youngest son of Duke Francis Josias, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and Princess Anna Sophie of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt. He was the great-uncle of King Leopold I of Belgium (1790‚Äì1865); and the great-great-uncle of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom (1819‚Äì1901). Military career Josias joined the Habsburg military as Colonel in 1759, participated in the Seven Years' War, and rose to the rank of Lieutenant Field Marshal by 1773. In the Russo- Turkish-Austrian war of 1788, he commanded an army corps under Freiherr von Laudon, occupying Moldavia, capturing Khotyn in Bessarabia and sharing in Aleksandr Suvorov's victory in the Battle of Foc»ôani (1 August 1789). Having completely beaten the main Ottoman army under Grand Vizier Koca Yusuf Pasha in the Battle of Rymnik, he captured the greater part of Wallachia, including Bucharest, being welcomed by the population after the flight of Prince Nicholas Mavrogenes (see History of Bucharest), and soon after becoming a field marshal. During the occupation of Moldavia, Josias met Therese Stroffeck, a commoner. On 24 September 1789, in the town of Roman, she bore him a son, named Frederick. Josias married Therese after their return to Coburg, on 24 December and recognized his son. Frederick was ennobled by the Austrian Emperor on 25 August 1808 and on 17 February 1853 the Duke Ernst II of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha created him Freiherr von Rohmann, named after the place of his birth. Frederick however, as the child of a morganatic marriage, and his descendants were barred of the succession of the duchy of Saxe-Coburg- Saalfeld. In 1793 and 1794 he commanded the army in the Austrian Netherlands during the Flanders Campaign. Due to his victory in the French Revolutionary Wars at Neerwinden in March 1793, he returned the region to Austrian control. Entering France, he took Cond√©, Valenciennes, Quesnoy and Landrecies. However, due to unfortunate positioning, partly due to disunity amongst the Allied powers and their forces, he suffered a string of minor setbacks in front of the Revolutionary Army on the Sambre, followed by a decisive defeat at Fleurus (26 June 1794). He thereupon abandoned the Netherlands, which Habsburg diplomats had already decided to give up. Angered by this, and openly criticizing the policies of the Baron Thugut, Josias resigned as Field Marshal (the Count of Clerfayt assumed command in his place) and retired to Coburg, where he later died.

When Gordon Brown took over as Prime Minister in June 2007, Harris kept his junior ministerial role but, in the October 2008 reshuffle, he was sacked and returned to the backbenches. On 9 June 2009, he was the first Scottish Labour MP to call for Gordon Brown to stand down as prime minister. Harris was a candidate in the 2011 Scottish Labour Party leadership election, but effectively admitted defeat on 10 December a week before the result was declared. In 2012, he returned to Ed Miliband's frontbench as shadow environment minister but left in June 2013 to spend more time with his family, being succeeded by Barry Gardiner.

He was active in the Edinburgh South Constituency Labour Party and was elected as the chairman of the Glasgow Cathcart Constituency Labour Party for two years in 1998. During his time at this post, he tried to stop the closure of the ABC Muirend/Toledo cinema, but was unsuccessful.

Scottish Labour Party leadership bid  In August 2011 Harris expressed an interest, and in September 2011 confirmed on Twitter he was standing in the election to be the next leader of the Scottish Labour Party, after the publication of the Murphy and Boyack review. He described the Scottish Labour Party as having had \\"no new ideas in 12 years [of devolution]\\", and that it must become a \\"party of aspiration\\" or it risked becoming irrelevant in the next few years. Harris was the only MP to enter the race and said Labour had become \\"too closely associated with the public sector\\", rather than being \\"a party of business\\". He also said the \\"Scottish Labour party was really in deep trouble and that we need to think outside the box. There is no indication that the party is prepared to do that yet and I don't know why\\". He considered standing in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, but announced via his podcast http://tomharrismp.podbean.com/2012/05/23/three-men-and-a-pod/ in May 2012 that he had given up this ambition and was committed to stand in his Glasgow South constituency at the United Kingdom general election of 2015.

In November 2019, he announced he would be voting for the Conservative Party in the 2019 general election.

He has held five ministerial positions and six shadow ministerial positions. Hayes served as Senior Parliamentary Adviser to David Cameron and was appointed as a Privy Councillor in April 2013, and a Knight Bachelor in November 2018. Hayes is considered a social conservative, economic protectionist, communitarian and Eurosceptic. He strongly supported Britain's withdrawal from the EU and has spoken regularly about his belief in conservative ideas and philosophy. Hayes is known for speaking passionately and theatrically in the House of Commons chamber and has been described as a \\"colourful character\\" who is \\"popular and influential on the Tory right\\". First elected in 1997, Hayes is the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Lincolnshire constituency of South Holland and The Deepings - the safest Conservative seat in the United Kingdom. South Holland delivered the nation's second-highest Leave vote in the 2016 referendum on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union. 73.6% of voters voted for withdrawal from the EU, second only to neighbouring Boston. Early life and career Hayes was born into a working-class family in Woolwich and grew up on a council estate. He was educated at the Colfe's Grammar School (Lewisham) and at the University of Nottingham from where he graduated with a BA degree in politics and a PGCE in history and English. Hayes was involved in a campaign to create a pipe-smoking society affiliated to the Students' Union. He also chaired the University's Conservative Association from 1981-82 while being President of one of the residential halls, Lincoln's Junior Common Room, and served as treasurer of the University's Students' Union from 1982‚Äì83. Hayes suffered a serious head injury in his early 20s, from which he has never fully recovered. He has focused much of his career on raising funds for research into acquired brain injury and support for those who suffer from it. Before entering Parliament, he was a sales director for The Data Base Ltd, an IT company based in Nottingham.

Brexit  Hayes described Britain's withdrawal from the EU as something \\"I've believed in for my whole life\\". He stated that voting Leave would provide an opportunity to \\"finally bring down the curtain on the Blair era\\". Following the referendum, Hayes criticised the \\"stunned hysteria\\" of an \\"establishment elite\\" who had \\"never before failed to get their own way\\".  Capital punishment  Hayes is reported as having asked the UK Government to consider bringing back the death penalty: referencing Westminster Bridge attacker Khalid Masood, Hayes stated that: \\"If he had survived I think most of the British public would have been OK if he had received a fair trial and been put to death - most people would deem that appropriate.\\". Additionally, Hayes states that, for murder, \\"I say capital punishment should be a sentence available to the courts but the death penalty should not be mandatory - that's always been my position.\\"  Constitutional monarchy  Hayes is a strong supporter of constitutional monarchy, but has voiced his opinion that the monarchy must resist the \\"culture of celebrity\\".  Economics  Hayes is a protectionist, rejecting \\"globalist free trade\\" and stating his belief that government should \\"redistribute advantage\\". He supports tariffs designed to protect \\"British jobs and British workers\\". Hayes has criticised the \\"gig economy\\" and believes that only \\"meaningful careers that contribute to societal good\\" can restore economic opportunities within the local communities they exist to serve. He has been a vocal critic of supermarkets, condemning their exploitation of farmers and suppliers and stating his belief that \\"supermarkets have decimated high streets, destroyed livelihoods and distorted the food chain\\". Hayes is a vocal proponent of small and medium-sized businesses and has reiterated his belief that \\"cooperatives, mutuals and guilds that can reshape and reform our economic system\\". He warned that the Conservative Party \\"must not allow itself to sleepwalk towards becoming a mouthpiece for globalist corporate business\\".  Foreign policy  Hayes has consistently voted in favour of military interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.  Safe standing  Hayes is in favour of safe standing at football stadiums.  Equal Marriage  Hayes has consistently voted against equal marriage. In line with his socially conservative views, he asserts marriage to be solely the lifetime union of one man and one woman.  Sex and gender  Hayes has argued the Government should respond with \\"compassion\\" to those who \\"feel compelled to identify as the opposite sex\\" but opposed proposals to allow individuals to change their natural gender without medical consultation. He criticised \\"radical LGBT groups\\" and stated his belief that \\"we must reaffirm that gender has no meaning if divorced from biological facts\\". In an article written in a local paper, Hayes argued \\"we should celebrate the God-given differences between men and women, enjoying the special characteristics of two naturally-ordained human types\\".  Wind turbines  During his time as Energy Minister, Hayes clashed with Liberal Democrat coalition partners when he declared that there should be no further construction of onshore wind turbines, declaring \\"enough is enough\\".

Hayes was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2016 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours for political and public service. He was appointed a Knight Bachelor in November 2018. This was an honour that was widely reported as bringing the awards system into disrepute; the supposition being that he had been offered and accepted the award in return for support for (or lack of opposition to) the Prime Minister's Brexit Draft Withdrawal Agreement. However, he subsequently announced his intention to vote against the proposed withdrawal agreement anyway.

Religious origins Babylonians made promises to their gods at the start of each year that they would return borrowed objects and pay their debts. The Romans began each year by making promises to the god Janus, for whom the month of January is named. In the medieval era, the knights took the \\"peacock vow\\" at the end of the Christmas season each year to re-affirm their commitment to chivalry. At watchnight services, many Christians prepare for the year ahead by praying and making these resolutions. This tradition has many other religious parallels. During Judaism's New Year, Rosh Hashanah, through the High Holidays and culminating in Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement), one is to reflect upon one's wrongdoings over the year and both seek and offer forgiveness. People can act similarly during the Christian liturgical season of Lent, although the motive behind this holiday is more of sacrifice than of responsibility. In fact, the Methodist practice of New Year's resolutions came, in part, from the Lenten sacrifices. The concept, regardless of creed, is to reflect upon self-improvement annually.  Participation  At the end of the Great Depression, about a quarter of American adults formed New Year's resolutions. At the start of the 21st century, about 40% did. In fact, according to the American Medical Association, approximately 40% to 50% of Americans participated in the New Year's resolution tradition from the 1995 Epcot and 1985 Gallop Polls Norcross, JC, Journal of Clinical Psychology, Vol. 58(4), 397-405, 2002 A study found 46% of participants who made common New Year's resolutions (e.g. weight loss, exercise programs, quitting smoking) were likely to succeed, over ten times as among those deciding to make life changes at other times of the year. Norcross, JC, Mrykalo, MS, Blagys, MD, J. Clin. Psych. 58: 397-405. 2009  Success rate  In a 2014 report, 35% of participants who failed their New Year's Resolutions admitted they had unrealistic goals, 33% of participants didn't keep track of their progress, and 23% forgot about them; about one in 10 respondents claimed they made too many resolutions. A 2007 study by Richard Wiseman from the University of Bristol involving 3,000 people showed that 88% of those who set New Year resolutions fail,Blame It on the Brain: The latest neuroscience research suggests spreading resolutions out over time is the best approach, Wall Street Journal, December 26, 2009 despite the fact that 52% of the study's participants were confident of success at the beginning. Men achieved their goal 22% more often when they engaged in goal setting, wherein resolutions are made in terms of small and measurable goals (e.g., \\"lose a pound a week\\" rather than \\"lose weight\\").

He represented the Clydesdale constituency until 2005, and the Lanark and Hamilton East constituency thereafter. Hood, a National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) trade union official during the miners' strike of 1984‚Äì85, remained a backbencher throughout his parliamentary career. Early life Jimmy Hood was born in Lesmahagow, Lanarkshire and was educated at the Lesmahagow Higher Grade School in Lesmahagow, Coatbridge College, Motherwell Technical College and University of Nottingham. He worked with the National Coal Board (NCB) for 23 years, as a mining engineer from 1964, the year he joined the NUM until 1987. He started his career with the NCB in the Lanarkshire Coalfield, at Auchlochan Colliery, moving to Nottinghamshire on the closure of the Lanarkshire coalfield in the summer of 1968 and became a NUM trade union official in 1973. During the Miners' Strike of 1984‚Äì5 he led the striking Nottinghamshire miners. From 1973‚Äì87 he was on Ollerton Parish Council. In 1979 he was elected as a councillor to the Newark and Sherwood District Council and served until his election to Westminster. Parliamentary career He was elected to the House of Commons as the Member of Parliament for Clydesdale at the 1987 general election, following the retirement of the sitting Labour MP Judith Hart. Hood won the seat with a majority of 10,502 votes. His Clydesdale-based seat was abolished as part of boundary changes directly before the 2005 general election. Hood then stood for the newly- created seat and was elected as MP for Lanark and Hamilton East. He represented the seat until his defeat at the 2015 general election to the Scottish National Party candidate, Angela Crawley. In Parliament, he joined the left-wing Campaign group and initially refused to pay the poll tax. In 1998, he called for the abolition of the system of parliamentary whips in a debate on workplace bullying, arguing that workplace abuses existed in Parliament \\"where careers are controlled by the carrot and stick of political patronage\\" and suggesting that \\"career assassination\\" was commonplace. Despite his credentials as a left-wing firebrand, he subsequently came to be regarded as a relatively loyal supporter of Tony Blair's 'New Labour'. He voted against the first Gulf War, and was one of many Labour rebels that voted against the invasion of Iraq in 2003 In Parliament, he served as the Chairman of the European legislation select committee from 1992‚Äì2006, having been a member from 1987. He was also member of the Liaison Committee from 1992-2006 and on the Defence Select Committee between 1997‚Äì2001. He was a Member of the Speaker's panel of Chairmen from 1997. In November 2008, Hood was one of 18 MPs who signed a Commons motion backing a Team GB football team at the 2012 Olympic Games, saying football \\"should not be any different from other competing sports and our young talent should be allowed to show their skills on the world stage\\". The football governing bodies of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all opposed to a Great Britain team, fearing it would stop them competing as individual nations in future tournaments. In February 2014, Hood outlined his opposition to Scottish independence in a commons debate, stating \\"Even if the SNP was right and there was a grand, great thing at the end of the rainbow for the SNP and its debate for independence, I would still be against it. If the Scottish people are going to be better off economically and so on, I would still be against breaking away from the Union\\". In October 2014, Hood invoked parliamentary privilege to link former Home Secretary Leon Brittan to accusations of improper conduct with children. He added that \\"I am just repeating what I read in the papers\\".https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm141028/debtext/141028-0003.htm#141028103001800%7C On 7 May 2015, Hood was unseated by the Scottish National Party candidate Angela Crawley, a South Lanarkshire Council councillor. Crawley overturned Hood's previous majority of 13,478 votes to command a 10,100 majority for the SNP.  Expenses  During the MPs expenses scandal, it was reported that Hood had claimed ¬£1,000 per month in second home expenses without claiming receipts, which was up to the permissible limits in place at the time. Hood said his second London home was necessary because of the distance of Westminster from Lanarkshire, and he accepted it would not be possible to make claims of that size in future without receipts and he \\"fully supported\\" putting details of expenses online. Personal life He married Marion McCleary in 1967; the couple had a son and a daughter and three grandchildren. He suffered a heart attack in 1998. Hood died of a second heart attack on 3 December 2017, aged 69.

Howarth, as Minister of State at the Home Office, chaired the Working Party on Electoral Procedures, which recommended that: absent voting should be allowed on demand and that the application and voting procedures for absent voting should be simplified. The Representation of the People Act 2000 implemented the recommendations.

On June 11, 1963, in a ceremonial demonstration, Wallace stood in front of the university's Foster Auditorium. Hood arrived to pay his fees, accompanied by Vivian Malone and Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach. Wallace intended to keep true to his promise of upholding segregation in the state and stopping \\"integration at the schoolhouse door\\".Elliot, Debbie. Wallace in the Schoolhouse Door. NPR.

As Malone and Hood waited in a car, Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach and a small team of federal marshals confronted Wallace to demand that Malone and Hood be allowed entry by order of the state court and for Wallace to step aside. Wallace had not only refused the order, but he interrupted Katzenbach; in front of the crowds of media crews surrounding him, Wallace delivered a short, symbolic speech concerning state sovereignty, claiming that \\"The unwelcomed, unwanted, unwarranted and force-induced intrusion upon the campus of the University of Alabama... of the might of the Central Government offers frightful example of the oppression of the rights, privileges and sovereignty of this State by officers of the Federal Government.\\" After seeing that Wallace would not step aside, Katzenbach called upon the assistance of President John F. Kennedy to force Wallace to permit the black students' entry into the university.Culpepper, Clark (1993), The Schoolhouse Door, Oxford University Press, p. 227. President Kennedy federalized the Alabama National Guard later the same day, which put them under the command of the President, rather than the Governor of Alabama. Guardsmen escorted Hood and Malone back to the auditorium, where Wallace moved aside at the request of General Henry Graham. Hood and Malone then entered the building, albeit through another door. Hood left the university after only two months but returned in 1995 to begin earning his doctorate degree. On May 17, 1997 he received his Ph.D. in interdisciplinary studies. In 1997, Wallace planned to give Hood his degree, but poor health prevented him from attending the ceremony. Hood himself was convinced that Wallace was sincere after that meeting, as he wrote in an interchange following the PBS documentary on Wallace, Setting the Woods on Fire. Hood attended Wallace's funeral in 1998, imploring others to forgive Wallace as he had, as Wallace had publicly apologized for his actions. Hood also received a bachelor's degree from Michigan's Wayne State University and a master's degree from Michigan State University.

He also told the meeting that, should his party attain government, he could accept the title of \\"Minister for War\\" reflecting his belief that wider Government should recognise that Great Britain is at war and support the armed forces appropriately.

It is not an aggressive or provocative gesture... it is a quiet demonstration of faith\\".

Homosexuals  In 2000, he described the lifting of the ban on homosexuals in the military as \\"appalling\\" and went on to state that the \\"decision will be greeted with dismay, particularly by \\"ordinary\\" soldiers in Her Majesty's forces, many of whom joined the services precisely because they wished to turn their backs on some of the values of modern society\\".

Retrieved 31 December 2012. is a British politician serving as Speaker of the House of Commons since November 2019 and Member of Parliament (MP) for Chorley since 1997. Before his election as Speaker, he was a Labour Party MP. As a Labour MP, Hoyle served as Chairman of Ways and Means and Deputy Speaker to John Bercow from 2010 to 2019, before being elected as Speaker on 4 November 2019.Deputy Speakers: Hoyle, Primarolo and Evans elected BBC News, 8 June 2010 Hoyle was unanimously re-elected as Speaker five days after the 2019 general election on 17 December. Early life The son of former Labour MP Doug Hoyle (born 1930) and Pauline Spencer (died 1991), Hoyle was born and raised in Adlington, Lancashire. He went to Anderton County Primary School in Adlington and Lord's College in Bolton. Prior to being elected as an MP, he ran his own textile and screen printing business. Political career=Councillor In the 1980 United Kingdom local elections, Hoyle was elected as the Labour Chorley Borough Councillor for the Adlington ward, defeating the sitting Conservative. He was re-elected four times, and served as Deputy Leader from 1994 to 1997. After being elected as an MP in 1997, he ended his time on the Council as the annual Mayor before stepping down at the local election in 1998. Backbench MP Hoyle in 2017 In February 1996, Hoyle was chosen to stand as the Labour candidate for the Chorley constituency at the 1997 general election. He won the election with a majority of 9,870, becoming the first Labour MP for Chorley in eighteen years. In the days after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in August 1997, Hoyle asked for a new national children's hospital to be built as a memorial to her. A few days later, Hoyle wrote to airport operator BAA, operators of London Heathrow Airport, urging them to change the airport's name to Diana, Princess of Wales Airport. Neither proposal was carried out. Hoyle served as a member of the Trade and Industry Committee (later the Business Committee) from 1998 to 2010 and as a member of the European Scrutiny Committee from 2005 to 2010. He is currently the President of the All-Party British Gibraltar Group in Parliament (of which his father is the Treasurer) and a Vice Chair of the All-Party British Virgin Islands Group. Hoyle clashed with then Prime Minister Tony Blair over issues such as Gibraltar and tuition fees. Regarding those clashes, Hoyle would say \\"I'm not anti-Tony; he made us electable and won three times. But there are principles and promises you don't break\\". Hoyle is one of the few MPs who refused to say whether they voted Leave or Remain in the 2016 referendum. Hoyle was created a Knight Bachelor in the 2018 New Year Honours. Chairman of Ways and Means Hoyle was elected Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons and Chairman of Ways and Means on 8 June 2010, the first time this appointment had been made by ballot of MPs, rather than by nomination of the Leader of the House. He was appointed to the Privy Council in January 2013. On 20 March 2013, Hoyle won wide public acclaim for his handling of the Budget proceedings, which were frequently interrupted by jeering MPs. In February 2017, Hoyle told off SNP MPs for singing the European Anthem during the vote for the Brexit Bill in the House of Commons, stating that he does not want parliament to turn into a sing-off. The same night, he had a clash with former Scottish First Minister, Alex Salmond, in a heated exchange over whether he had cut off an SNP MP while speaking. In March 2017, Hoyle called on social media companies to take swifter action to crack down on offensive posts, arguing it deters Jewish and Muslim women from becoming MPs. Hoyle was in the Speaker's Chair during the terrorist attack in Westminster on 22 March 2017, and the subsequent suspension and lockdown of the Commons. Hoyle was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2018 New Year Honours for parliamentary and political services.  Speaker of the House of Commons  On 4 November 2019, Hoyle entered the election for Speaker to replace John Bercow. In the days leading up to the election, Hoyle was consistently seen by the media as the front runner. Hoyle maintained a substantial lead in the first, second, and third ballots of the election, but without reaching the 50% required to win. Hoyle was elected Speaker on the fourth ballot, defeating Chris Bryant and winning 325 votes out of a total of 540 cast. Hoyle then duly received royal approbation in the House of Lords. In accordance with convention, following the election Hoyle rescinded his Labour party membership. In his acceptance speech, Hoyle stated that \\"this House will change, but it will change for the better\\", and stated that he would be a \\"transparent\\" Speaker, also pledging to take the welfare of House of Commons staff seriously. He was unanimously confirmed as Speaker after the 2019 election. Personal life Hoyle lives in Adlington, Lancashire. As Speaker of the House of Commons he has an official residence at Speaker's House, at the northeast corner of the Palace of Westminster, which is used for official functions and meetings and which has private accommodation in a four-bedroom apartment upstairs. Hoyle has been married twice and has had two daughters. He was married from 1974 to Lynda Anne Fowler; they divorced in 1982. In June 1993, Hoyle married Catherine Swindley, who succeeded him as the Labour Councillor for Adlington in May 1998. He has also employed his wife as his part-time constituency secretary. Hoyle's elder daughter, Emma, used to work at his constituency office, in which capacity she represented him at Chorley Borough Council. Hoyle and Conservative Maldon District Councillor Miriam Lewis also had a daughter, Natalie Lewis-Hoyle, who died suddenly in December 2017 at the age of 28. Lindsay Hoyle said he was \\"truly devastated\\" by the death of his daughter Natalie. Away from politics, he is a supporter of his local football league team, Bolton Wanderers, and Rugby league team Warrington Wolves. Hoyle stated that he had been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes shortly before the 2019 General Election. Hoyle was appointed as the Chancellor of the University of Gibraltar in 2020. Styles of address From his father's ennoblement in 1997 he was entitled to the style of The Honourable. He gained the style of The Right Honourable when sworn into the Privy Council on 12 February 2013.

He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Doncaster North from 1992 to 2005. He served as a government whip, and was previously a coal miner and official for the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). Early and private life Hughes was born in Doncaster, the son of a coal miner. He was educated at Owston Park secondary modern, and took up his father's profession in 1970. He remained a miner until 1990, but also attended University of Sheffield for three years under a day-release scheme. Personal life Kevin and Lynda Hughes married in 1972. They had a son and a daughter together. His son joined the Army, and served in the 2003 Gulf War. Political career Originally a communist, he joined the New Communist Party in 1977 but left to join the Labour Party in 1978. He served as a branch delegate and member of the Yorkshire area committee of the NUM. He was elected as a member of Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council in 1986, and elected to Parliament in the 1992 general election for the safe Labour seat of Doncaster North. As an MP, he was sponsored by the NUM, although the number of working coal pits in his constituency had been reduced from 6 to only 1. He campaigned on pit safety issues before the privatisation of British Coal in the early 1990s. Despite allegations being made against him by fellow councillor Ron Rose, Hughes avoided blame in the \\"Donnygate\\" scandal, which resulted in 21 former members of Doncaster council being convicted for fraud offences, and he retained his seat in the House of Commons in 1997, despite being opposed by an \\"anti-fraud\\" candidate, and again in 2001. He became a whip for the opposition in 1996, and was a junior whip in the Labour government from 1997 to 2001. He vigorously supported the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Hughes is renowned for his comment in Parliament about readers of The Guardian, many of whom support Labour, in support of new anti-terrorism legislation following the 9/11 attacks: Hughes stood down early from Parliament in 2005 after being diagnosed with motor neurone disease, which claimed his life the following year.

Familiar with making rubber devices, he re-invented pneumatic tyres for his child's tricycle and developed them for use in cycle racing. He sold his rights to the pneumatic tyres to a company he formed with the president of the Irish Cyclists' Association, Harvey Du Cros, for a small cash sum and a small shareholding in their pneumatic tyre business. Dunlop withdrew in 1896. The company that bore his name, Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company, was not incorporated until later using the name well known to the public, but it was Du Cros's creation. Veterinary practice He was born on a farm in Dreghorn, North Ayrshire, and studied to be a veterinary surgeon at the Dick Vet, University of Edinburgh, a profession he pursued for nearly ten years at home, moving to Downpatrick, Ireland in 1867. Quite early in his life he was told he had been a premature birth, two months before his mother had expected. He convinced himself his health was delicate and throughout his life acted accordingly, but he had no serious illness until he contracted a chill in October 1921 aged 81 and died unexpectedly. Sir Arthur Du Cros described him as a diffident and gentle-mannered man but confident in his abilities.Sir Arthur Du Cros, Bt, Wheels of Fortune, a salute to pioneers, Chapman & Hall, London 1938 He married Margaret Stevenson in 1871 and they had a daughter and a son. He established Downe Veterinary Clinic in Downpatrick with his brother James Dunlop before moving to a practice in 38‚Äì42 May Street, Belfast where, by the mid 1880s, his was one of the largest practices in Ireland. Dunlop developed pneumatic tyres for his son's tricycle and soon had them made commercially in Scotland. A cyclist using his tyres began to win all races and drew the attention of Harvey Du Cros. Dunlop sold his rights into a new business with Du Cros for some cash and a small shareholding. With Du Cros he overcame many difficulties experienced by their business, including the loss of his patent rights. In 1892 he retired from his veterinary practice and moved to Dublin soon after Harvey Du Cros with his assistance successfully refloated Booth Bros of Dublin as the Pneumatic Tyre and Booth's Cycle Agency. The pneumatic tyre revolutionised the bicycle industry, which had boomed after the 1885 introduction of J K Starley's safety bicycle.B. W. Best, Dunlop, John Boyd (1840‚Äì1921), rev. Trevor I. Williams, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 J B Dunlop sold out in 1895 and took no further interest in the tyre or rubber business. His remaining business interest was a local drapery. Pneumatic tyres Dunlop's first pneumatic bicycle tyre National Museum of Scotland Dunlop on a bicycle c. 1915 In October 1887, John Boyd Dunlop developed the first practical pneumatic or inflatable tyre for his son's tricycle and, using his knowledge and experience with rubber, in the yard of his home in Belfast fitted it to a wooden disc 96 centimetres across.The Bicycle, UK, 21 July 1943, p3 The tyre was an inflated tube of sheet rubber. He then took his wheel and a metal wheel from his son's tricycle and rolled both across the yard together. The metal wheel stopped rolling but the pneumatic continued until it hit a gatepost and rebounded. Dunlop then put pneumatics on both rear wheels of the tricycle. That too rolled better, and Dunlop moved on to larger tyres for a bicycle \\"with even more startling results.\\"The Bicycle, UK, 21 July 1943, p3 He tested that in Cherryvale sports ground, South Belfast, and a patent was granted on 7 December 1888. Unknown to Dunlop another Scot, Robert William Thomson from Stonehaven, had patented a pneumatic tyre in 1847. Willie Hume demonstrated the supremacy of Dunlop's tyres in 1889, winning the tyre's first-ever races in Ireland and then England.The Golden Book of Cycling ‚Äì William Hume, 1938. Archive maintained by 'The Pedal Club'. Dunlop, What sets Dunlop apart, History, 1889 The captain of the Belfast Cruisers Cycling Club, he became the first member of the public to purchase a bicycle fitted with pneumatic tyres, so Dunlop suggested he should use them in a race. On 18 May 1889 Hume won all four cycling events at the Queen's College Sports in Belfast, and a short while later in Liverpool, won all but one of the cycling events. Among the losers were sons of the president of the Irish Cyclists' Association, Harvey Du Cros. Seeing an opportunity, Du Cros built a personal association with J B Dunlop, and together they set up a company which acquired his rights to his patent. Two years after he was granted the patent, Dunlop was officially informed that it was invalid as Scottish inventor Robert William Thomson (1822‚Äì1873), had patented the idea in France in 1846 and in the US in 1847. (see Tyres.) To capitalise on pneumatic tyres for bicycles, Dunlop and Du Cros resuscitated a Dublin-listed company and renamed it Pneumatic Tyre and Booth's Cycle Agency. Dunlop retired in 1895. In 1896 Du Cros sold their whole bicycle tyre business to British financier Terah Hooley for ¬£3 million. Hooley arranged some new window-dressing, titled board members, etc., and re-sold the company to the public for ¬£5 million. Du Cros remained head of the business until his death. Early in the 20th century it was renamed Dunlop Rubber. Though he did not participate after 1895, Dunlop's pneumatic tyre did arrive at a crucial time in the development of road transport. His commercial production of cycle tyres began in late 1890 in Belfast, but the production of car tyres did not begin until 1900, well after his retirement. J B Dunlop did not make any great fortune by his invention. Death and legacy The Dunlop logo is widely recognised around the world John Boyd Dunlop died at his home in Dublin's Ballsbridge in 1921 and is buried in Deans Grange Cemetery. Although the Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company no longer exists as a corporate entity, the Dunlop name lives on in a number of Dunlop-branded products, including automotive, aerospatial, industrial and sporting products around the world. The Dunlop brand commonly appears as a corporate sponsor of international sporting events such as motor racing and tennis matches. From the 1980s, Dunlop was commemorated in Northern Ireland when his image featured on the ¬£10 banknote issued by the Northern Bank as part of its Inventor Series. The notes have been re-issued several times, and the banknotes bearing Dunlop's likeness (now issued by the Danske Bank) are still in circulation today. In 2005, Dunlop was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame. An avenue in the city of Campinas, in southeast Brazil, is also named after him; that is because a Dunlop tyre factory was established there in 1953.

He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Braintree in Essex from 1997 to 2005. Early life He is the son of George Hurst. He attended Westcliff High School for Boys in Westcliff-on-Sea. From the University of Liverpool, he gained a BA in History. Before his election as MP he had been deputy leader of Southend-on-Sea Council, joining the council in 1968. He continued to practise part-time as a solicitor while an MP. Parliamentary career At the 1997 general election he caused a stir by overturning Tony Newton's majority of 17,494, with a majority of 1,494; Braintree had been Conservative since the 1955 election. Almost as surprising (though not with hindsight, since the Tories made next to no progress nationally in 2001) was his holding the seat at the 2001 general election, though this time with a majority of 358, making it Labour's second-most marginal victory at that election and the sixth-most overall. He lost the seat in the 2005 general election to Brooks Newmark of the Conservative Party. Hurst never held government office, remaining a backbencher. He served on the Select committee for agriculture for a time (including during the 2001 UK foot and mouth crisis) and then on the Speaker's Panel. He occasionally rebelled against the government (see Public Whip page), often on judicial issues, though not on any high-profile issues or as part of any major rebellions, with the exception of supporting an amendment to the top-up fees bill (Higher Education Act 2004) which would have removed such fees from the bill whilst maintaining other aspects of it, an attempt to have the bill's increased funding for universities without higher fees (presumably by putting up the basic or higher rate of income tax or introducing a graduate tax); the government claimed that the greater funding (almost, though not quite, universally accepted to be necessary) could only be achieved with top-up fees, so the choice was fees or continuing underfunding, but many saw this as a false dichotomy imposed by the government (which had pledged not to raise income tax - indeed, had cut it in its first term - and had already raised National Insurance contributions once, though this move was very popular) to hold funding hostage, as it were, and ensure the bill's passing. This rebellion was not overly important, as the much larger rebellion on the bill's second reading had already failed (by a mere five votes). He did vote for a total ban on hunting with dogs when the government was proposing mere restriction, but this was not, strictly speaking, a rebellion as it was a free vote.

Unlike most structures in order theory, a cyclic order is not modeled as a binary relation, such as \\"\\". One does not say that east is \\"more clockwise\\" than west. Instead, a cyclic order is defined as a ternary relation , meaning \\"after , one reaches before \\". For example, [June, October, February]. A ternary relation is called a cyclic order if it is cyclic, asymmetric, transitive, and total. Dropping the \\"total\\" requirement results in a partial cyclic order. A set with a cyclic order is called a cyclically ordered set or simply a cycle. Some familiar cycles are discrete, having only a finite number of elements: there are seven days of the week, four cardinal directions, twelve notes in the chromatic scale, and three plays in rock- paper-scissors. In a finite cycle, each element has a \\"next element\\" and a \\"previous element\\". There are also continuously variable cycles with infinitely many elements, such as the oriented unit circle in the plane. Cyclic orders are closely related to the more familiar linear orders, which arrange objects in a line. Any linear order can be bent into a circle, and any cyclic order can be cut at a point, resulting in a line. These operations, along with the related constructions of intervals and covering maps, mean that questions about cyclic orders can often be transformed into questions about linear orders. Cycles have more symmetries than linear orders, and they often naturally occur as residues of linear structures, as in the finite cyclic groups or the real projective line. Finite cycles A 5-element cycle A cyclic order on a set with elements is like an arrangement of on a clock face, for an -hour clock. Each element in has a \\"next element\\" and a \\"previous element\\", and taking either successors or predecessors cycles exactly once through the elements as . There are a few equivalent ways to state this definition. A cyclic order on is the same as a permutation that makes all of into a single cycle. A cycle with elements is also a -torsor: a set with a free transitive action by a finite cyclic group. Another formulation is to make into the standard directed cycle graph on vertices, by some matching of elements to vertices. It can be instinctive to use cyclic orders for symmetric functions, for example as in : where writing the final monomial as would distract from the pattern. A substantial use of cyclic orders is in the determination of the conjugacy classes of free groups. Two elements and of the free group on a set are conjugate if and only if, when they are written as products of elements and with in , and then those products are put in cyclic order, the cyclic orders are equivalent under the rewriting rules that allow one to remove or add adjacent and . A cyclic order on a set can be determined by a linear order on , but not in a unique way. Choosing a linear order is equivalent to choosing a first element, so there are exactly linear orders that induce a given cyclic order. Since there are possible linear orders, there are possible cyclic orders. Definitions An infinite set can also be ordered cyclically. Important examples of infinite cycles include the unit circle, , and the rational numbers, . The basic idea is the same: we arrange elements of the set around a circle. However, in the infinite case we cannot rely upon an immediate successor relation, because points may not have successors. For example, given a point on the unit circle, there is no \\"next point\\". Nor can we rely upon a binary relation to determine which of two points comes \\"first\\". Traveling clockwise on a circle, neither east or west comes first, but each follows the other. Instead, we use a ternary relation denoting that elements , , occur after each other (not necessarily immediately) as we go around the circle. For example, in clockwise order, [east, south, west]. By currying the arguments of the ternary relation , one can think of a cyclic order as a one-parameter family of binary order relations, called cuts, or as a two-parameter family of subsets of , called intervals. The ternary relation The general definition is as follows: a cyclic order on a set is a relation , written , that satisfies the following axioms: #Cyclicity: If then #Asymmetry: If then not #Transitivity: If and then #Totality: If , , and are distinct, then either or The axioms are named by analogy with the asymmetry, transitivity, and totality axioms for a binary relation, which together define a strict linear order. considered other possible lists of axioms, including one list that was meant to emphasize the similarity between a cyclic order and a betweenness relation. A ternary relation that satisfies the first three axioms, but not necessarily the axiom of totality, is a partial cyclic order. Rolling and cuts Given a linear order on a set , the cyclic order on induced by is defined as follows:; . : if and only if or or Two linear orders induce the same cyclic order if they can be transformed into each other by a cyclic rearrangement, as in cutting a deck of cards. One may define a cyclic order relation as a ternary relation that is induced by a strict linear order as above. Cutting a single point out of a cyclic order leaves a linear order behind. More precisely, given a cyclically ordered set (, each element defines a natural linear order on the remainer of the set, , by the following rule:; . : if and only if . Moreover, can be extended by adjoining as a least element; the resulting linear order on is called the principal cut with least element . Likewise, adjoining as a greatest element results in a cut . Intervals Given two elements , the open interval from to , written , is the set of all such that . The system of open intervals completely defines the cyclic order and can be used as an alternate definition of a cyclic order relation. An interval has a natural linear order given by . One can define half-closed and closed intervals , , and by adjoining as a least element and/or as a greatest element. As a special case, the open interval is defined as the cut . More generally, a proper subset S of K is called convex if it contains an interval between every pair of points: for , either or must also be in S. A convex set is linearly ordered by the cut for any not in the set; this ordering is independent of the choice of . Automorphisms As a circle has a clockwise order and a counterclockwise order, any set with a cyclic order has two senses. A bijection of the set that preserves the order is called an ordered correspondence. If the sense is maintained as before, it is a direct correspondence, otherwise it is called an opposite correspondence.Coxeter 1949 page 25 Coxeter uses a separation relation to describe cyclic order, and this relation is strong enough to distinguish the two senses of cyclic order. The automorphisms of a cyclically ordered set may be identified with C2, the two- element group, of direct and opposite correspondences. Monotone functions The \\"cyclic order = arranging in a circle\\" idea works because any subset of a cycle is itself a cycle. In order to use this idea to impose cyclic orders on sets that are not actually subsets of the unit circle in the plane, it is necessary to consider functions between sets. A function between two cyclically ordered sets, , is called a monotonic function or a homomorphism if it pulls back the ordering on : whenever , one has . Equivalently, is monotone if whenever and , and are all distinct, then . A typical example of a monotone function is the following function on the cycle with 6 elements: : : : A function is called an embedding if it is both monotone and injective. Equivalently, an embedding is a function that pushes forward the ordering on : whenever , one has . As an important example, if is a subset of a cyclically ordered set , and is given its natural ordering, then the inclusion map is an embedding. Generally, an injective function from an unordered set to a cycle induces a unique cyclic order on that makes an embedding. Functions on finite sets A cyclic order on a finite set can be determined by an injection into the unit circle, . There are many possible functions that induce the same cyclic order‚Äîin fact, infinitely many. In order to quantify this redundancy, it takes a more complex combinatorial object than a simple number. Examining the configuration space of all such maps leads to the definition of an polytope known as a cyclohedron. Cyclohedra were first applied to the study of knot invariants; they have more recently been applied to the experimental detection of periodically expressed genes in the study of biological clocks. The category of homomorphisms of the standard finite cycles is called the cyclic category; it may be used to construct Alain Connes' cyclic homology. One may define a degree of a function between cycles, analogous to the degree of a continuous mapping. For example, the natural map from the circle of fifths to the chromatic circle is a map of degree 7. One may also define a rotation number. Completion *A cut with both a least element and a greatest element is called a jump. For example, every cut of a finite cycle is a jump. A cycle with no jumps is called dense. *A cut with neither a least element nor a greatest element is called a gap. For example, the rational numbers have a gap at every irrational number. They also have a gap at infinity, i.e. the usual ordering. A cycle with no gaps is called complete. *A cut with exactly one endpoint is called a principal or Dedekind cut. For example, every cut of the circle is a principal cut. A cycle where every cut is principal, being both dense and complete, is called continuous. and The set of all cuts is cyclically ordered by the following relation: if and only if there exist such that: :, :, and :. A certain subset of this cycle of cuts is the Dedekind completion of the original cycle. Further constructions=Unrolling and covers Starting from a cyclically ordered set , one may form a linear order by unrolling it along an infinite line. This captures the intuitive notion of keeping track of how many times one goes around the circle. Formally, one defines a linear order on the Cartesian product , where is the set of integers, by fixing an element and requiring that for all :; :If , then . For example, the months , , , and occur in that order. This ordering of is called the universal cover of . Its order type is independent of the choice of , but the notation is not, since the integer coordinate \\"rolls over\\" at . For example, although the cyclic order of pitch classes is compatible with the A-to-G alphabetical order, C is chosen to be the first note in each octave, so in note-octave notation, B3 is followed by C4. The inverse construction starts with a linearly ordered set and coils it up into a cyclically ordered set. Given a linearly ordered set and an order- preserving bijection with unbounded orbits, the orbit space is cyclically ordered by the requirement: :If , then . In particular, one can recover by defining on . There are also -fold coverings for finite ; in this case, one cyclically ordered set covers another cyclically ordered set. For example, the is a double cover of the . In geometry, the pencil of rays emanating from a point in the oriented plane is a double cover of the pencil of unoriented lines passing through the same point.; These covering maps can be characterized by lifting them to the universal cover. Products and retracts right Given a cyclically ordered set and a linearly ordered set , the (total) lexicographic product is a cyclic order on the product set , defined by if one of the following holds: * * and * and * and * and The lexicographic product globally looks like and locally looks like ; it can be thought of as copies of . This construction is sometimes used to characterize cyclically ordered groups. One can also glue together different linearly ordered sets to form a circularly ordered set. For example, given two linearly ordered sets and , one may form a circle by joining them together at positive and negative infinity. A circular order on the disjoint union } is defined by , where the induced ordering on is the opposite of its original ordering. For example, the set of all longitudes is circularly ordered by joining together all points west and all points east, along with the prime meridian and the 180th meridian. use this construction while characterizing the spaces of orderings and real places of double formal Laurent series over a real closed field. Topology The open intervals form a base for a natural topology, the cyclic order topology. The open sets in this topology are exactly those sets which are open in every compatible linear order. To illustrate the difference, in the set [0, 1), the subset [0, 1/2) is a neighborhood of 0 in the linear order but not in the cyclic order. Interesting examples of cyclically ordered spaces include the conformal boundary of a simply connected Lorentz surface and the leaf space of a lifted essential lamination of certain 3-manifolds. Discrete dynamical systems on cyclically ordered spaces have also been studied. The interval topology forgets the original orientation of the cyclic order. This orientation can be restored by enriching the intervals with their induced linear orders; then one has a set covered with an atlas of linear orders that are compatible where they overlap. In other words, a cyclically ordered set can be thought of as a locally linearly ordered space: an object like a manifold, but with order relations instead of coordinate charts. This viewpoint makes it easier to be precise about such concepts as covering maps. The generalization to a locally partially ordered space is studied in ; see also Directed topology. Related structures=Groups A cyclically ordered group is a set with both a group structure and a cyclic order, such that left and right multiplication both preserve the cyclic order. Cyclically ordered groups were first studied in depth by Ladislav Rieger in 1947. They are a generalization of cyclic groups: the infinite cyclic group and the finite cyclic groups . Since a linear order induces a cyclic order, cyclically ordered groups are also a generalization of linearly ordered groups: the rational numbers , the real numbers , and so on. Some of the most important cyclically ordered groups fall into neither previous category: the circle group and its subgroups, such as the subgroup of rational points. Every cyclically ordered group can be expressed as a quotient , where is a linearly ordered group and is a cyclic cofinal subgroup of . Every cyclically ordered group can also be expressed as a subgroup of a product , where is a linearly ordered group. If a cyclically ordered group is Archimedean or compact, it can be embedded in itself. Modified axioms A partial cyclic order is a ternary relation that generalizes a (total) cyclic order in the same way that a partial order generalizes a total order. It is cyclic, asymmetric, and transitive, but it need not be total. An order variety is a partial cyclic order that satisfies an additional spreading axiom . Replacing the asymmetry axiom with a complementary version results in the definition of a co-cyclic order. Appropriately total co-cyclic orders are related to cyclic orders in the same way that is related to . A cyclic order obeys a relatively strong 4-point transitivity axiom. One structure that weakens this axiom is a CC system: a ternary relation that is cyclic, asymmetric, and total, but generally not transitive. Instead, a CC system must obey a 5-point transitivity axiom and a new interiority axiom, which constrains the 4-point configurations that violate cyclic transitivity. A cyclic order is required to be symmetric under cyclic permutation, , and asymmetric under reversal: . A ternary relation that is asymmetric under cyclic permutation and symmetric under reversal, together with appropriate versions of the transitivity and totality axioms, is called a betweenness relation. A separation relation is a quaternary relation that can be thought of as a cyclic order without an orientation. The relationship between a circular order and a separation relation is analogous to the relationship between a linear order and a betweenness relation. Symmetries and model theory provide a model- theoretic description of the covering maps of cycles. studies groups of automorphisms of cycles with various transitivity properties. characterize cycles whose full automorphism groups act freely and transitively. characterize countable colored cycles whose automorphism groups act transitively. studies the automorphism group of the unique (up to isomorphism) countable dense cycle. study minimality conditions on circularly ordered structures, i.e. models of first-order languages that include a cyclic order relation. These conditions are analogues of o-minimality and weak o-minimality for the case of linearly ordered structures. continues with some characterizations of œâ-categorical structures. Cognition Hans Freudenthal has emphasized the role of cyclic orders in cognitive development, as a contrast to Jean Piaget who addresses only linear orders. Some experiments have been performed to investigate the mental representations of cyclically ordered sets, such as the months of the year. Notes on usage The relation may be called a cyclic order , a circular order , a cyclic ordering , or a circular ordering . Some authors call such an ordering a total cyclic order , a complete cyclic order , a linear cyclic order , or an l-cyclic order or ‚Ñì-cyclic order , to distinguish from the broader class of partial cyclic orders, which they call simply cyclic orders. Finally, some authors may take cyclic order to mean an unoriented quaternary separation relation . A set with a cyclic order may be called a cycle or a circle . The above variations also appear in adjective form: cyclically ordered set (cyklicky uspo≈ô√°dan√© mno≈æiny, ), circularly ordered set, total cyclically ordered set, complete cyclically ordered set, linearly cyclically ordered set, l-cyclically ordered set, ‚Ñì-cyclically ordered set. All authors agree that a cycle is totally ordered. There are a few different symbols in use for a cyclic relation. uses concatenation: . and use ordered triples and the set membership symbol: . uses concatenation and set membership: , understanding as a cyclically ordered triple. The literature on groups, such as and , tend to use square brackets: . use round parentheses: , reserving square brackets for a betweenness relation. use a function-style notation: . Rieger (1947), cited after ) uses a \\"less- than\\" symbol as a delimiter: . Some authors use infix notation: , with the understanding that this does not carry the usual meaning of and for some binary relation < . emphasizes the cyclic nature by repeating an element: . calls an embedding an \\"isomorphic embedding\\". In this case, write that is \\"rolled up\\".

He is best known for his discovery of the chemical elements holmium and thulium. Born in Stockholm in 1840, Cleve earned his BSc and PhD from Uppsala University in 1863 and 1868, respectively. After receiving his PhD, he became an assistant professor of chemistry at the university. He later became professor of general and agricultural chemistry. In 1874 he theorised that didymium was in fact two elements; this theory was confirmed in 1885 when Carl Auer von Welsbach discovered neodymium and praseodymium. In 1879 Cleve discovered holmium and thulium. His other contributions to chemistry include the discovery of aminonaphthalenesulfonic acids, also known as Cleve's acids. From 1890 on he focused on biological studies. He developed a method of determining the age and order of late glacial and postglacial deposits from the types of diatom fossils in the deposits, and wrote a seminal text in the field of oceanography. He died in 1905 at age 65. Early life Cleve in 1863 Cleve was born in Stockholm, Sweden, as the thirteenth child of his father, a merchant known as F. T. Cleve. Cleve's ancestors on his father's side came from western Germany and settled in Sweden in the late 18th century. Cleve showed interest in natural science and natural history from an early age. He attended the Stockholms Lyceum in 1858, studying chemistry and biology. He gained a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Uppsala in 1863 and a PhD from the same university in 1868. Career In 1860, aged 20, Cleve became assistant professor of mineralogy at the University of Uppsala, and was appointed assistant professor of chemistry in 1868. He also taught at the Royal Institute of Technology between 1870 and 1874, and eventually became professor of general and agricultural chemistry at the University of Uppsala. He was the chair of chemistry at the University of Uppsala starting in 1874. He was also the president of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry. Cleve's first work was N√•gra ammoniakaliska chromf√∂reningar (Some compounds of ammonia and chromium, 1861). He also wrote several more papers on complex compounds, including the compounds of platinum. Additionally, Cleve synthesized several hundred complex platinum compounds. Cleve visited a number of laboratories in England, France, Italy, and Switzerland in the 1860s. While in Paris, he visited the laboratory of Charles-Adolphe Wurtz and also made a number of friends there. Cleve in the lab, c. 1900 Cleve worked on the synthesis of complex chemical compounds until 1872. He theorized in 1874 that the element didymium consisted of two elements. This theory was proven right with the discovery of praseodymium and neodymium in 1885 by Carl Auer von Welsbach. In 1879, Cleve proved that the newly discovered element scandium was an element predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev to be \\"eka-boron\\". He isolated a quantity of scandium in this same year and determined its atomic weight. He discovered the element holmium in 1879 by examining a sample of erbium oxide. While removing impurities from a sample of erbium oxide, Cleve discovered a brown substance and a green substance, and the brown substance was holmium oxide (the green substance was thulium oxide). However, this sample may have been impure. He separated thulium from an erbium oxide sample in 1879. Additionally, Cleve and Abraham Langlet discovered helium in the mineral cleveite in 1895. Cleve discovered six forms of dichloronaphthalene and discovered aminonaphthalenesulfonic acids, which are sometimes named after him. He prepared a number of nitrosulfonic acids as well. In 1883, Cleve was the first person to describe the plankton species Nitzschia seriata. In 1890, Cleve began to mainly focus on the field of biology, mainly studying freshwater algae, diatoms, and plankton. Cleve participated in a Swedish expedition to Spitsbergen in 1898. While on this mission, he discovered a number of species of spumellarians, nassellarians, and phaeodarians. Cleve, in collaboration with Otto H√∂glund prepared numerous previously-undiscovered salts of yttrium and erbium. The two also did work on the chemistry of the chemical elements thorium and lanthanum. By 1874, Cleve discovered that thorium was a quadrivalent element and also determined lanthanum to be trivalent. These findings were initially doubted by the scientific community. Cleve was the first observer of isomerism in platinumamine derivatives. Additionally, Cleve created a method of dating glacial and post-glacial deposits in the fossil record. Cleve's PhD dissertation was \\"Mineral-analytiska under-s√∂kningar\\". He wrote a paper on samarium in 1879 and The Seasonal Distribution of Atlantic Plankton Organisms in 1900. In 1883, he published Kemiskt Handlexicon, which translates to Chemical Handbook. Notable students of Cleve include Ellen Fries (the first Swedish woman to earn a PhD) and Svante Arrhenius (a winner of the Nobel Prize). Cleve also studied hydrography and geology. Personal life, family, and death In 1874, Cleve married Alma √ñhbom, a teacher; the couple had three daughters. The first daughter, Astrid Cleve (born 22 January 1875), became a botanist. His son-in-law and grandson, Hans von Euler-Chelpin and Ulf von Euler, both won Nobel Prizes. Cleve was friends with Thomas Edward Thorpe. Per Teodore Cleve was a supporter of women's equality and Ellen Fries, the first Swedish woman to receive a PhD, was one of his students. Cleve began experiencing pleurisy in December 1904 and it affected his heart. He thought that he had recovered by the spring of 1905, and he returned home to Uppsala, Sweden,. but he died there on 18 June 1905. Awards and legacy Cleve joined the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1871. He received a Davy Medal in 1894 and 1904. The mineral cleveite is named for Cleve.

It is usually short-term help until the long-term help by the government and other institutions replaces it. Among the people in need are the homeless, refugees, and victims of natural disasters, wars, and famines. Humanitarian relief efforts are provided for humanitarian purposes and include natural disasters and man-made disaster. The primary objective of humanitarian aid is to save lives, alleviate suffering, and maintain human dignity. It may, therefore, be distinguished from development aid, which seeks to address the underlying socioeconomic factors which may have led to a crisis or emergency. There is a debate on linking humanitarian aid and development efforts, which was reinforced by the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016. However, the conflation is viewed critically by practitioners. Humanitarian aid is seen as \\"a fundamental expression of the universal value of solidarity between people and a moral imperative\\". Humanitarian aid can come from either local or international communities. In reaching out to international communities, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) of the United Nations (UN) is responsible for coordination responses to emergencies. It taps to the various members of Inter-Agency Standing Committee, whose members are responsible for providing emergency relief. The four UN entities that have primary roles in delivering humanitarian aid are United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Food Programme (WFP). According to The Overseas Development Institute, a London-based research establishment, whose findings were released in April 2009 in the paper \\"Providing aid in insecure environments:2009 Update\\", the most lethal year for aid providers in the history of humanitarianism was 2008, in which 122 aid workers were murdered and 260 assaulted. The countries deemed least safe were Somalia and Afghanistan. In 2014, Humanitarian Outcomes reported that the countries with the highest incidents were: Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen and Kenya. History=Origins The beginnings of organized international humanitarian aid can be traced to the late 19th century. The most well-known origin story of formalized humanitarian aid is that of Henri Dunant, a Swiss businessman and social activist, who upon seeing the sheer destruction and inhumane abandonment of wounded soldiers from the Battle of Solferino in June 1859, canceled his plans and began a relief response. Humanitarian efforts that precede the work of Henri Dunant include British aid to distressed populations on the continent and in Sweden during the Napoleonic Wars, and the international relief campaigns during the Great Irish Famine in the 1840s. In 1854, when the Crimean War beganHosein Karimi, Negin Masoudi Alavi. Florence Nightingale: The Mother of Nursing. Nurs Midwifery Stud. 2015 Jun;4(2) Florence Nightingale and her team of 38 nurses arrived to Barracks Hospital of Scutari where there were thousands of sick and wounded soldiers.Joseph H. Choate. What Florence Nightingale Did for Mankind. Am J Nurs. 1911 Feb;11(5):346‚Äì57. Nightingale and her team watched as the understaffed military hospitals struggled to maintain hygienic conditions and meet the needs of patients. Ten times more soldiers were dying of disease than from battle wounds.Elizabeth Fee, Mary E. Garofalo. Florence Nightingale and the Crimean War. Typhus, typhoid, cholera and dysentery were common in the army hospitals. Nightingale and her team established a kitchen, laundry and increased hygiene. More nurses arrived to aid in the efforts and the General Hospital at Scutari was able to care for 6,000 patients. Nightingale's contributions still influence humanitarian aid efforts. This is especially true in regard to Nightingale's use of statistics and measures of mortality and morbidity. Nightingale used principles of new science and statistics to measure progress and plan for her hospital. She kept records of the number and cause of deaths in order to continuously improve the conditions in hospitals.Understanding Uncertainty. Florence Nightingale and the Crimean War. Her findings were that in every 1,000 soldiers, 600 were dying of communicable and infectious diseases.Hosein Karimi, Negin Masoudi Alavi. Florence Nightingale: The Mother of Nursing. Nurs Midwifery Stud. 2015 Jun;4(2). She worked to improve hygiene, nutrition and clean water and decreased the mortality rate from 60% to 42% to 2.2%. All of these improvements are pillars of modern humanitarian intervention. Once she returned to Great Britain she campaigned for the founding of the Royal Commission on the Health of the Army. She advocated for the use of statistics and coxcombs to portray the needs of those in conflict settings.Forsythe, David. The Humanitarians: The International Committee of the Red Cross. (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005), 15. Despite little to no experience as a medical physician, Dunant worked alongside local volunteers to assist the wounded soldiers from all warring parties, including Austrian, Italian and French casualties, in any way he could including the provision of food, water, and medical supplies. His graphic account of the immense suffering he witnessed, written in his book ‚ÄúA Memory of Solferino\\", became a foundational text to modern humanitarianism.Barnett, Michael, and Weiss, Thomas. Humanitarianism in Question: Politics, Power, Ethics. (New York: Cornell University Press, 2008), 101. A Memory of Solferino changed the world in a way that no one, let alone Dunant, could have foreseen nor truly appreciated at the time. To start, Dunant was able to profoundly stir the emotions of his readers by bringing the battle and suffering into their homes, equipping them to understand the current barbaric state of war and treatment of soldiers after they were injured or killed; in of themselves these accounts altered the course of history.Bugnion, Francois. \\"Birth of an Idea: The Founding of the International Committee of the Red Cross and of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement: From Solferino to the Original Geneva Convention (1859‚Äì1864).\\" International Review of the Red Cross 94 (2013): 1306. Beyond this, in his two-week experience attending to the wounded soldiers of all nationalities, Dunant inadvertently established the vital conceptual pillars of what would later become the International Committee of the Red Cross and International Humanitarian Law: impartiality and neutrality.Bugnion, Francois. \\"Birth of an Idea: The Founding of the International Committee of the Red Cross and of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement: From Solferino to the Original Geneva Convention (1859‚Äì1864).\\" International Review of the Red Cross 94 (2013): 1303 Dunant took these ideas and came up with two more ingenious concepts that would profoundly alter the practice of war; first Dunant envisioned a creation of permanent volunteer relief societies, much like the ad hoc relief group he coordinated in Solferino, to assist wounded soldiers; next Dunant began an effort to call for the adoption of a treaty which would guarantee the protection of wounded soldiers and any who attempted to come to their aid.ugnion, Francois. \\"Birth of an Idea: The Founding of the International Committee of the Red Cross and of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement: From Solferino to the Original Geneva Convention (1859‚Äì1864).\\" International Review of the Red Cross 94 (2013): 1300 After publishing his foundational text in 1862, progress came quickly for Dunant and his efforts to create a permanent relief society and International Humanitarian Law. The embryonic formation of the International Committee of the Red Cross had begun to take shape in 1863 when the private Geneva Society of Public Welfare created a permanent sub-committee called ‚ÄúThe International Committee for Aid to Wounded in Situations of War‚Äù; composed of five Geneva citizens, this committee endorsed Dunant's vision to legally neutralize medical personnel responding to wounded soldiers.Forsythe, David. The Humanitarians: The International Committee of the Red Cross. (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005), 17.Bugnion, Francois. \\"Birth of an Idea: The Founding of the International Committee of the Red Cross and of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement: From Solferino to the Original Geneva Convention (1859‚Äì1864).\\" International Review of the Red Cross 94 (2013): 1311 The constitutive conference of this committee in October 1863 created the statutory foundation of the International Committee of the Red Cross in their resolutions regarding national societies, caring for the wounded, their symbol, and most importantly the indispensable neutrality of ambulances, hospitals, medical personnel and the wounded themselves.Bugnion, Francois. \\"Birth of an Idea: The Founding of the International Committee of the Red Cross and of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement: From Solferino to the Original Geneva Convention (1859‚Äì1864).\\" International Review of the Red Cross 94 (2013): 1320. Beyond this, in order to solidify humanitarian practice, the Geneva Society of Public Welfare hosted a convention between 8 and 22 August 1864 at the Geneva Town Hall with 16 diverse States present, including many governments of Europe, the Ottoman Empire, the United States of America (USA), Brazil and Mexico.Bugnion, Francois. \\"Birth of an Idea: The Founding of the International Committee of the Red Cross and of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement: From Solferino to the Original Geneva Convention (1859‚Äì1864).\\" International Review of the Red Cross 94 (2013): 1323. This diplomatic conference was exceptional, not due to the number or status of its attendees but rather because of its very raison d'√™tre. Unlike many diplomatic conferences before it, this conference's purpose was not to reach a settlement after a conflict nor to mediate between opposing interests; indeed this conference was to lay down rules for the future of conflict with aims to protect medical services and those wounded in battle.Bugnion, Francois. \\"Birth of an Idea: The Founding of the International Committee of the Red Cross and of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement: From Solferino to the Original Geneva Convention (1859‚Äì1864).\\" International Review of the Red Cross 94 (2013): 1324 The first of the renowned Geneva Conventions was signed on 22 August 1864; never before in history has a treaty so greatly impacted how warring parties engage with one another.Bugnion, Francois. \\"Birth of an Idea: The Founding of the International Committee of the Red Cross and of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement: From Solferino to the Original Geneva Convention (1859‚Äì1864).\\" International Review of the Red Cross 94 (2013): 1325 The basic tenents of the convention outlined the neutrality of medical services, including hospitals, ambulances, and related personnel, the requirement to care for and protect the sick and wounded during the conflict and something of particular symbolic importance to the International Committee of the Red Cross: the Red Cross emblem.Bugnion, Francois. \\"Birth of an Idea: The Founding of the International Committee of the Red Cross and of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement: From Solferino to the Original Geneva Convention (1859‚Äì1864).\\" International Review of the Red Cross 94 (2013):1325 For the first time in contemporary history, it was acknowledged by a representative selection of states that war had limits. The significance only grew with time in the revision and adaptation of the Geneva Convention in 1906, 1929 and 1949; additionally, supplementary treaties granted protection to hospital ships, prisoners of war and most importantly to civilians in wartime.Bugnion, Francois. \\"Birth of an Idea: The Founding of the International Committee of the Red Cross and of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement: From Solferino to the Original Geneva Convention (1859‚Äì1864).\\" International Review of the Red Cross 94 (2013):1326 The International Committee of the Red Cross exists to this day as the guardian of International Humanitarian Law and as one of the largest providers of humanitarian aid in the world. A contemporary print showing the distribution of relief in Bellary, Madras Presidency. From the Illustrated London News (1877) Another such examples occurred in response to the Northern Chinese Famine of 1876‚Äì1879, brought about by a drought that began in northern China in 1875 and led to crop failures in the following years. As many as 10 million people may have died in the famine.Edgerton-Tarpley, Kathryn, \\"Pictures to Draw Tears from Iron\\" , accessed 25 December 2013 British missionary Timothy Richard first called international attention to the famine in Shandong in the summer of 1876 and appealed to the foreign community in Shanghai for money to help the victims. The Shandong Famine Relief Committee was soon established with the participation of diplomats, businessmen, and Protestant and Roman Catholic missionaries.Janku, Andrea (2001) \\"The North-China Famine of 1876‚Äì1879: Performance and Impact of a Non-Event.\\" In: Measuring Historical Heat: Event, Performance, and Impact in China and the West. Symposium in Honour of Rudolf G. Wagner on His 60th Birthday. Heidelberg, 3‚Äì4 November, pp. 127‚Äì134 To combat the famine, an international network was set up to solicit donations. These efforts brought in 204,000 silver taels, the equivalent of $7‚Äì10 million in 2012 silver prices. A simultaneous campaign was launched in response to the Great Famine of 1876‚Äì78 in India. Although the authorities have been criticized for their laissez-faire attitude during the famine, relief measures were introduced towards the end. A Famine Relief Fund was set up in the United Kingdom and had raised ¬£426,000 within the first few months. 1980s RAF C-130 airdropping food during 1985 famine Early attempts were in private hands and were limited in their financial and organizational capabilities. It was only in the 1980s, that global news coverage and celebrity endorsement were mobilized to galvanize large-scale government-led famine (and other forms of) relief in response to disasters around the world. The 1983‚Äì85 famine in Ethiopia caused upwards of 1 million deaths and was documented by a BBC news crew, with Michael Buerk describing \\"a biblical famine in the 20th Century\\" and \\"the closest thing to hell on Earth\\". Live Aid, a 1985 fund-raising effort headed by Bob Geldof induced millions of people in the West to donate money and to urge their governments to participate in the relief effort in Ethiopia. Some of the proceeds also went to the famine hit areas of Eritrea.  2010s  The first global summit on humanitarian diplomacy was held on 23 and 24 May 2016 in Istanbul, Turkey. An initiative of United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the World Humanitarian Summit included participants from governments, civil society organizations, private organizations, and groups affected by humanitarian need. Issues that were discussed included: preventing and ending conflict, managing crises, and aid financing. Funding Aid is funded by donations from individuals, corporations, governments and other organizations. The funding and delivery of humanitarian aid is increasingly international, making it much faster, more responsive, and more effective in coping to major emergencies affecting large numbers of people (e.g. see Central Emergency Response Fund). The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) coordinates the international humanitarian response to a crisis or emergency pursuant to Resolution 46/182 of the United Nations General Assembly. The need for aid is ever-increasing and has long outstripped the financial resources available. Delivery of humanitarian aid Truck for delivery of aid from Western to Eastern Europe Humanitarian aid spans a wide range of activities, including providing food aid, shelter, education, healthcare or protection. The majority of aid is provided in the form of in- kind goods or assistance, with cash and vouchers constituting only 6% of total humanitarian spending.[High Level Panel on Humanitarian Cash Transfers Doing cash differently: how cash transfers can transform humanitarian aid] However, evidence has shown how cash transfers can be better for recipients as it gives them choice and control, they can be more cost-efficient and better for local markets and economies. It is important to note that humanitarian aid is not only delivered through aid workers sent by bilateral, multilateral or intergovernmental organizations, such as the United Nations. Actors like the affected people themselves, civil society, local informal first-responders, civil society, the diaspora, businesses, local governments, military, local and international non-governmental organizations all play a crucial role in a timely delivery of humanitarian aid.  Technology and humanitarian aid  Traditionally, humanitarian organizations have concentrated their efforts in the delivery of human, medical, food, shelter and water sanitation and hygiene resources during humanitarian emergencies. Nevertheless, since the 2010 Haiti Earthquake, the institutional and operational focus of humanitarian aid has been on leveraging technology to enhance humanitarian action, ensuring that more formal relationships are established, and improving the interaction between formal humanitarian organizations such as the United Nations (UN) Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and informal volunteer and technological communities known as digital humanitarians. The recent rise in Big Data, high-resolution satellite imagery and new platforms powered by advanced computing have already prompted the development of innovative computational solutions to help humanitarian organizations make sense of the vast volume and velocity of information generated during disasters. For example, crowdsourcing maps (such as Open Street Maps) and social media messages in Twitter were used during the 2010 Haiti Earthquake and Hurricane Sandy to trace leads of missing people, infrastructure damages and rise new alerts for emergencies. Satellite imagery is now used to predict how many people will be displaced from their homes and where they will likely move. Such insights helps emergency personnel to identify how much aid in terms of water, food and medical care will be needed and where to send it before they conduct a Rapid Needs Assessment on the field, and at the same time it helps prevent putting the humanitarian organization personnel at risk. Artificial intelligence algorithms may instantaneously assess flooding, building and road damage based on satellite images and weather forecasts, allowing rescuers to distribute emergency aid more effectively and identify those still in danger and isolated from escape routes. Another example that illustrates technology used for humanitarian purposes is the Artificial Intelligence for Digital Response (AIDR) platform which is a free and open source software that automatically collects and classifies tweets that are posted during emergencies, humanitarian crises and disasters. AIDR uses human and machine intelligence to automatically tag up to thousands of messages per minute so humanitarian organizations are able to take faster decisions depending on the trends from the data collected during a specific kind emergency. Big data for humanitarian operations provides a unique opportunity to access instantaneously contextual information about pending and ongoing humanitarian crises. The development of rigorous information management systems may lead to feasible mechanisms for forecasting and preventing crises. Nevertheless, there are important issues to be discussed concerning the veracity and validity of data. Data that are collected or generated through digital or mobile mechanisms will often pose additional challenges, especially regarding the verification when the information comes from social media. Though a significant amount of work is under way to develop software and algorithms for verifying crowdsourced or anonymously provided data, such tools are not yet operational or widely available. Also, multiple data transactions and increased complexity in data structures raise the potential for error in humanitarian data entry and interpretation, and this raises concerns about the accuracy and representativeness of data that is used for policy decisions in highly pressurized situations that demand quick decision-making.  Humanitarian aid and conflict  In addition to post-conflict settings, a large portion of aid is often directed at countries currently undergoing conflicts. However, the effectiveness of humanitarian aid, particularly food aid, in conflict-prone regions has been criticized in recent years. There have been accounts of humanitarian aid being not only inefficacious, but actually fueling conflicts in the recipient countries. Aid stealing is one of the prime ways in which conflict is promoted by humanitarian aid. Aid can be seized by armed groups, and even if it does reach the intended recipients, \\"it is difficult to exclude local members of local militia group from being direct recipients if they are also malnourished and qualify to receive aid.\\" Furthermore, analyzing the relationship between conflict and food aid, a recent research shows that the United States' food aid promoted civil conflict in recipient countries on average. An increase in United States' wheat aid increased the duration of armed civil conflicts in recipient countries, and ethnic polarization heightened this effect. However, since academic research on aid and conflict focuses on the role of aid in post-conflict settings, the aforementioned finding is difficult to contextualize. Nevertheless, research on Iraq shows that \\"small-scale [projects], local aid spending . . . reduces conflict by creating incentives for average citizens to support the government in subtle ways.\\" Similarly, another study also shows that aid flows can \\"reduce conflict because increasing aid revenues can relax government budget constraints, which can [in return] increase military spending and deter opposing groups from engaging in conflict.\\" Thus, the impact of humanitarian aid on conflict may vary depending upon the type and mode in which aid is received, and, inter alia, the local socio-economic, cultural, historical, geographical and political conditions in the recipient countries. Aid workers UNICEF humanitarian aid, ready for deploying. This can be food like Plumpy'nuts or water purification tablets. Wanda B≈Çe≈Ñska, Polish leprosy expert and missionary who successfully developed the Buluba Hospital in Uganda Aid workers are the people distributed internationally to do humanitarian aid work. They often require humanitarian degrees. Composition Bangladeshi citizens offload food rations from a US Marine CH-46E helicopter of 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit after Tropical Cyclone Sidr in 2007 The total number of humanitarian aid workers around the world has been calculated by ALNAP, a network of agencies working in the Humanitarian System, as 210,800 in 2008. This is made up of roughly 50% from NGOs, 25% from the Red Cross/ Red Crescent Movement and 25% from the UN system. In 2010, it was reported that the humanitarian fieldworker population increased by approximately 6% per year over the previous 10 years. Psychological Issues Aid workers are exposed to tough conditions and have to be flexible, resilient, and responsible in an environment that humans are not psychologically supposed to deal with, in such severe conditions that trauma is common. In recent years, a number of concerns have been raised about the mental health of aid workers. The most prevalent issue faced by humanitarian aid workers is PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). Adjustment to normal life again can be a problem, with feelings such as guilt being caused by the simple knowledge that international aid workers can leave a crisis zone, whilst nationals cannot. A 2015 survey conducted by The Guardian, with aid workers of the Global Development Professionals Network, revealed that 79 percent experienced mental health issues. Standards The humanitarian community has initiated a number of interagency initiatives to improve accountability, quality and performance in humanitarian action. Five of the most widely known initiatives are the Active Learning Network for Accountability and Performance in Humanitarian Action (ALNAP), Humanitarian Accountability Partnership (HAP), People in Aid, the Sphere Project and the Core Humanitarian Standard on Quality and Accountability (CHS). Representatives of these initiatives began meeting together on a regular basis in 2003 in order to share common issues and harmonise activities where possible. People in Aid The People in Aid Code of Good Practice was an internationally recognised management tool that helps humanitarian aid and development agencies enhance the quality of their human resources management. As a management framework, it was also a part of agencies‚Äô efforts to improve standards, accountability and transparency amid the challenges of disaster, conflict and poverty. ‚Äì Background to the People in Aid Code of Good Practice Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International Working with its partners, disaster survivors, and others, Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International (or HAP International) produced the HAP 2007 Standard in Humanitarian Accountability and Quality Management. This certification scheme aims to provide assurance that certified agencies are managing the quality of their humanitarian actions in accordance with the HAP standard.Capacity.org ‚Äì A Gateway for Capacity Development In practical terms, a HAP certification (which is valid for three years) means providing external auditors with mission statements, accounts and control systems, giving greater transparency in operations and overall accountability.The Economist ‚Äì Certifying Aid Agencies, 24 May 2007Reuters Alernet Website ‚Äì Can a certificate make aid agencies better listeners? 6 June 2008 As described by HAP-International, the HAP 2007 Standard in Humanitarian Accountability and Quality Management is a quality assurance tool. By evaluating an organisation's processes, policies and products with respect to six benchmarks setout in the Standard, the quality becomes measurable, and accountability in its humanitarian work increases. Agencies that comply with the Standard: * declare their commitment to HAP's Principles of Humanitarian Action and to their own Humanitarian Accountability Framework * develop and implement a Humanitarian Quality Management System * provide key information about quality management to key stakeholders * enable beneficiaries and their representatives to participate in program decisions and give their informed consent * determine the competencies and development needs of staff * establish and implement complaints-handling procedure * establish a process of continual improvementHAP-International Website ‚Äì The HAP 2007 Standard Sphere Project The Sphere Project handbook, Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response, which was produced by a coalition of leading non-governmental humanitarian agencies, lists the following principles of humanitarian action: * The right to life with dignity * The distinction between combatant and non-combatants * The principle of non-refoulement Core Humanitarian Standard on Quality and Accountability Logo of the Core Humanitarian Standard Another humanitarian standard used is the Core Humanitarian Standard on Quality and Accountability (CHS). It was approved by the CHS Technical Advisory Group in 2014, and has since been endorsed by many humanitarian actors such as \\"the Boards of the Humanitarian Accountability Partnership (HAP), People in Aid and the Sphere Project\\". It comprises nine core standards, which are complemented by detailed guidance notes and indicators. While some critics were questioning whether the sector will truly benefit from the implementation of yet another humanitarian standard, others have praised it for its simplicity. Most notably, it has replaced the core standards of the Sphere Handbook and it is regularly referred to and supported by officials from the United Nations, the EU, various NGOs and institutes. Humanitarian Encyclopedia The Humanitarian Encyclopedia, launched in June 2017, aims to create \\"a clear and comprehensive reference framework, influenced by local and contextualised knowledge ‚Ä¶ [including] analyses of lessons learned and best practices, as well as ‚Ä¶ insights for evidence-based decision and policy-making.\\" A part of this mission will be to provide a centralised data base for defining or clarifying different understandings of key concepts in humanitarian aid. The need for this stems from the experience in Haiti in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake, where international aid organisations pushed out local aid groups as a result of a lack of reflection and understanding of local contexts and aid concepts, making the relief effort less efficient. Free to access, the project is expected to be completed within five years, with the first parts slated to be published online by the end of 2018.

It was founded around 3000 BC and has survived to this day. It was inhabited by Greek populations from antiquity until the destruction of Smyrna in 1922 and the exchange of populations that followed with the Treaty of Lausanne. In its long history it has changed location twice. The first location (prehistoric times) was mentioned by Strabo as \\"Old Smyrna\\" and the second location was built by Alexander the Great and his descendants (Hellenistic period). Ionians, in about 11th century BC, established the League of Ionia. It was later conquered by the Persians and retaken by the Greeks before being subsumed into the Roman Empire. In Roman times it became very prosperous and the Romans honored it three times with the praiseworthy title of \\"young girl\\" because of its amazing prosperity. Izmir was not the first city to recognize Rome as a deity.The term \\"Catholic Church\\" was first used in 110 in a letter from St. Ignatius of Antioch to the Church of Smyrna. After the split of the Roman Empire, the area became part of what is now called the Byzantine Empire until it was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in the 14th century. In 1424, Smyrna was conquered by the Ottomans. However, before and after its occupation, Venetians and Genoese tried several times to include it in their Republics. On September 13, 1472, the Venetians, under Pietro Mokenigo, captured and destroyed the city, in a failed attempt. Following the First World War, the province was ceded to Greece, but was retaken by the forces of Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk in the Turkish War of Independence.

Early life She attended Whalley Range High School in Whalley Range, Manchester, then Footscray High School in Melbourne, Australia. She worked as welfare worker for disabled people for the CHS Manchester from 1963‚Äì70. From 1970‚Äì2, she was an education welfare officer for the Manchester Education Committee. From 1978‚Äì80, she was Registrar of Marriages for Bury Registration District. From 1989‚Äì96, she was a project worker for Calderdale Well Woman Centre. Before her election to parliament, McCafferty was a member of Hebden Royd Town Council 1991‚Äì95. She was also a councillor on Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council 1991‚Äì7, where she was chair of the Adoption Panel 1992‚Äì6. She served as member of the West Yorkshire Police Authority 1994‚Äì7. Parliamentary career McCafferty was selected as a Labour candidate through an all-women shortlist. She was elected in the 1997 Labour landslide, replacing the Conservative Sir Donald Thompson who had held the seat since 1979. Her election was subject of the book This England by Pete Davies. She held the seat in the 2001 and 2005 general elections despite Tory resurgence.

Since 1999, she has also been a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, chairing the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Population, Development and Reproductive Health. She was the author of the McCafferty Report, which proposed to limit the freedom of medical professionals to decline to perform controversial medical practices, such as abortion, in order to insure access to medical treatment. The initiative was ultimately defeated when, on 7 October 2010, a narrow majority of Members adopted a number of amendments that turned it into its opposite: it now re-affirms the free exercise of conscientious objection, instead of restricting it. In 2007, McCafferty announced that she would retire at the next general election.

She served as an Assistant Whip in the Labour Government, but was sacked following comments regarding a leadership contest to replace prime minister Gordon Brown. Early life McDonagh is a Roman Catholic of Irish descent.Siobhain McDonagh MP McDonagh was educated at the Holy Cross School, New Malden and later studied Politics at the University of Essex. She was a clerical officer for the DHSS between 1981‚Äì83, a receptionist at the Wandsworth Homeless Persons Unit from 1984‚Äì86, and a housing adviser from 1986‚Äì88. Prior to being elected to Parliament she worked as a Development Manager for Battersea Churches Housing Trust from 1988‚Äì97. She also served as a councillor on London Borough of Merton for Colliers Wood ward between 1982 and 1998, chairing the Housing Committee between 1990 and 1995, being instrumental in the rebuilding of Phipps Bridge Estate. Parliamentary career McDonagh was first elected in the 1997 election for Labour, having been selected through an all-women shortlist, defeating the Conservative incumbent, Dame Angela Rumbold, to whom she had lost in the 1987 and 1992 General Elections, on a swing of 11.6 percentage of the votes, similar to the national average. After the 2001 election, prime minister Tony Blair offered McDonagh the position of Parliamentary Undersecretary of State for the Communities. She declined the offer and remained a backbencher. After the May 2005 general election, she served as PPS to Dr. John Reid while he served as Secretary of State for Defence and from May 2006 to June 2007 Secretary of State for the Home Department. She was appointed to the position of Assistant Whip in June 2007 in the re-shuffle brought about by Gordon Brown becoming Prime Minister. On 12 September 2008, McDonagh became the first member of the government to call for a leadership contest, resulting in her dismissal from her government post. In June 2015, McDonagh nominated Liz Kendall, considered the Blairite candidate, for the leadership of the Labour Party. She supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election. In 2018, McDonagh offered her support to Labour MP Chris Leslie when he faced a confidence motion from his CLP, a vote he subsequently lost. McDonagh endorsed Jess Phillips in the 2020 Labour Party leadership election.  Middle East  In March 2003, McDonagh voted in favour of the country going to war with Iraq. She has consistently voted against any inquiry into the Iraq War. In December 2015, she was among the minority of Labour MPs who voted in favour of extending UK military airstrikes against ISIL into Syria. She has written that it was a decision \\"not easy to come to\\". McDonagh abstained from a vote about the UK's support for Saudi Arabia's military campaign in Yemen. The vote was defeated by a majority of 90. As noted by commentators, the vote would have succeeded if 97 Labour MPs had not abstained. Expenses In April 2000, her office sent a party political questionnaire to 200 of her constituents using parliamentary resources; a spokesman for McDonagh subsequently said it was a \\"mistake\\". McDonagh promised to apologise and reimburse the cost to her office. In 2007, her expenditure on stationery and postage attracted criticism, being more than any other MP's for postage from 2003 to 2006. In total, her office spent ¬£126,833 on postage in the four-year period, an average of almost ¬£32,000 per year. When adding in stationery costs, the expenditure was approximately ¬£50,000 in both 2004‚Äì05 and 2006‚Äì07. McDonagh responded stating, \\"I believe the job of an MP is to keep in contact with constituents on important issues.\\" Mobile phone theft In October 2010, her mobile phone was stolen from her car. Although not implicated in the robbery itself, it became evident that The Sun newspaper had accessed the phone, including messages stored on it. She sued the paper and in March 2013 won \\"substantial damages.\\" Antisemitism comments In 2019, McDonagh was criticised by some left-wing members of the party after she appeared to agree with a statement put forward by John Humphrys on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. McDonagh said anti-semitism is a problem in the Labour Party, because \\"part of [Labour] politics, of hard left politics, [is] to be against capitalists and to see Jewish people as the financiers of capital.\\" When Humphrys asked her if that meant that \\"to be anti-capitalist you have to be antisemitic\\", McDonagh replied, \\"Yes.\\" Personal life McDonagh lives in Colliers Wood in her constituency with her sister Margaret, who was General Secretary of the Labour Party between 1998 and 2001, during Tony Blair's premiership.

She worked as an advocate with the Community Law Office in Brussels, before becoming a political advisor to the European Democrats group in the European Parliament in 1983 until 1989.  European Parliament After an unsuccessful attempt at a UK Parliamentary seat (1987 general election at Workington), where she was defeated by the sitting Labour MP Dale Campbell-Savours, McIntosh was elected for Essex North East at the 1989 European Parliament election and later for its successor seat of Essex North and Suffolk South at the 1994 election. She served as a Member of the European Parliament until she stood down at the 1999 elections.  UK Parliamentary career =Member of Parliament for Vale of York McIntosh was elected to the House of Commons in the 1997 general election for the Vale of York which she won by a comfortable 9,721 majority and held the seat without difficulty until it was abolished in 2010. She was promoted to the Opposition frontbench in 2001 as Spokesperson for Culture, Media and Sport and has since held a number of front bench positions including Transport (2003‚Äì2005), Foreign Affairs (2005), Work and Pensions (2005‚Äì2007), and Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (2007‚Äì2010), though never at Shadow Cabinet level. McIntosh was elected as Chairman of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee in 2010. In 2014 she received wide acclaim for her \\"robust chairmanship\\" and \\"tackling the establishment head on\\". After boundary changes agreed in 2006, the Vale of York constituency was divided up leaving no obvious successor; the seat most closely associated was Thirsk and Malton which was the successor to Ryedale, held since 1987 by John Greenway.

Ireland had participated in the Commonwealth in the 1930s and 40s. Mackinlay's view was that historians were wrong to say that Ireland had left the Commonwealth in 1949. This was, he said, because the Commonwealth, to the extent that it existed, was nothing like the Commonwealth of today. He felt that the London Declaration formula that permitted republics to participate in the Commonwealth had not been offered to Ireland as an option, though he felt it was not too late to do so. He argued that Ireland should be formally invited to join and that the Commonwealth was its \\"natural place\\". Personal life He is a keen researcher on World War I history, travelling and discovering Ireland, and is an honorary patron of Tilbury Football Club.

Early life He was educated by the Irish Christian Brothers at St Mary's College, Crosby. He studied for an LLB at the University of Hull. He was head of department in History at St Mary's Grammar School (now called St Mary's College) in Hull from 1958‚Äì64 and a Law lecturer at Hull College of Commerce from 1964‚Äì66. Parliamentary career After unsuccessfully contesting Bridlington in 1964, McNamara was elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for Kingston upon Hull North, in a by-election in January 1966 following the death of sitting Labour MP Henry Solomons. Labour's hold of a former marginal seat with a significantly increased majority is widely considered to have helped to convince the Prime Minister Harold Wilson to call the 1966 election to seek a larger majority. McNamara retained his seat at the 1966 general election, and at subsequent elections until the constituency was abolished for the February 1974 general election, when he transferred to the new Kingston upon Hull Central constituency. When that constituency was abolished for the 1983 election, McNamara was re-elected for the re-created Kingston upon Hull North constituency. McNamara campaigned in his last years in parliament on many issues, protesting against the Act of Succession which prohibits a Roman Catholic or the spouse of a Roman Catholic to be the British monarch. He stepped down at the 2005 general election, with the local Constituency Labour Party choosing Diana Johnson to stand in his place. During the 2005 general election campaign McNamara claimed some of the policies regarding illegal travellers' sites of the leader of the Conservative Party, Michael Howard had \\"whiff of the gas chambers\\" about them. Howard's grandmother died at Auschwitz. Northern Ireland McNamara was known throughout his parliamentary career as a supporter of Irish nationalism who favoured a United Ireland. After entering parliament, he soon became interested in reports of discrimination against the Catholic minority in Northern Ireland and supported the Campaign for Democracy in Ulster (CDU). He served as a frontbench spokesman for the Labour Party, including Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland under Neil Kinnock, 1987‚Äì94, an appointment that was widely criticised by Unionists. After Tony Blair became Labour leader, he replaced McNamara as Northern Ireland spokesman with Mo Mowlam.Henry Patterson, Ireland since 1939: The persistence of conflict (Dublin: Penguin Ireland, 2006) p. 334 In 1997, he helped persuade the newly elected Labour government to donate ¬£5,000 (thereby matching the contribution of the Irish government) for the erection of a memorial in Liverpool to the victims of the Great Irish Famine.Christine Kinealy, The Great Irish Famine, (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2002), p. 12 McNamara also supported Republicanism in the United Kingdom and joined the All-Party Parliamentary Republic Group. Personal and later life McNamara was a Roman Catholic and a Knight of the Pontifical Order of Saint Gregory the Great.Papal Knights of Great Britain He was married to Nora McNamara, and was the father of four sons and a daughter. In 2006, McNamara received the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of Hull in recognition of his long service in politics. He graduated with a PhD from the University of Liverpool in 2007 having completed a thesis on the MacBride PrinciplesJ. K. McNamara, \\"The MacBride Principles\\", unpublished PhD thesis, (University of Liverpool, 2006) at the Institute of Irish Studies, where he gave the 2008 John Kennedy Lecture in Irish Studies, '.

He was Labour Party and Co-operative Member of Parliament for Hemel Hempstead between 1997 and 2005. Early life=Education He went to the independent catholic St Benedict's School in Ealing. At the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, he gained a BSc in Pure Maths in 1967, and a BSc in Philosophy in 1968. At McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, he gained an MA in Philosophy in 1968. At University College, Oxford, he gained a BPhil in Philosophy in 1971 and he was offered the degree of MLitt in 1983. Career From 1963‚Äì4, he was a teacher at the catholic Cardinal Wiseman secondary school in Greenford, west London. From 1964‚Äì7, he was periodically a lorry driver for EH Paterson Ltd. From 1968‚Äì9, he was a teaching fellow at McMaster University. He is a former philosophy lecturer at the University of Hertfordshire in Hatfield, beginning when it was known as Hatfield Polytechnic in 1974. He also lectured at Thames Polytechnic (now called the University of Greenwich) from 1972‚Äì4. In the late 1980s he was Director of Computing at the university's education campus at Wall Hall. McWalter's principal academic interest is in the philosophy of Kant, and with George MacDonald Ross he co- edited Kant and His Influence. After electoral defeat, McWalter established an educational consultancy business offering one to one tuition in mathematics and the sciences. In this role he taught again at the University of Hertfordshire, teaching mathematics on a contract basis until 2007. In 2007 he was appointed as an associate lecturer at the Open University mathematics department (London region): and in 2010 he gained qualified teacher status from the Institute of Education (London University). He is a key stage five specialist teacher at The Thomas Alleyne Academy in Stevenage, teaching mathematics and physics. Parliamentary career He contested St Albans in 1987 and Luton North in 1992. He also contested two European Parliament seats, Hertfordshire (1984) and Bedfordshire South (1989). McWalter won the Hemel Hempstead seat from Robert Jones (Conservative) in 1997 and held it in 2001, and was narrowly defeated by 499 votes by Mike Penning (Conservative) in 2005. Early in his Westminster career, McWalter was one of a number of Labour MPs who petitioned for a planned cut in single-parents benefits, scheduled by the previous Conservative administration, to be cancelled before it came into effect. The cancellation of the cut was announced but then later revoked. McWalter abstained on the first vote in the Commons on implementing the cut. On later votes on the Welfare Reform bill McWalter voted with the government, but he did so having secured amendments on mobility allowance for disabled children aged between three and five, and on the bereavement allowance (which had been scheduled to be cut to six months so that widowers and widows could be given equal treatment). McWalter often cites this as evidence that it is possible for backbenchers to get laws beneficially amended. McWalter served on the Northern Ireland select committee during the extraordinary period before and after the Good Friday Agreement. McWalter also served on the Procedure Committee, where his principal concern was the treatment of bill committees in the House. Specifically, the whips would only appoint \\"nodding dogs\\", and many clauses would be left both unamended and even undebated. On 27 February 2002, McWalter asked the prime minister the following question: \\"My right hon. Friend is sometimes subject to rather unflattering or even malevolent descriptions of his motivation. Will he provide the House with a brief characterisation of the political philosophy that he espouses and which underlies his policies?\\" The prime minister was famously confused. McWalter later claimed that he was annoyed by the constant theme in government that seemed to suggest that the main justification for a policy was that it was \\"modern\\". McWalter also claimed that the prime minister had had four days' notice of the question, and that his only motive was to get a carefully thought-out and principled response. McWalter hosted three adjournment debates which have been read widely. One was on the teaching of philosophy on 1 July 1999, and it was circulated in academic circles as a concise justification for why the subject is important. It attracted independent laudatory notes from Bernard Williams and Simon Blackburn (professors of philosophy at Oxford and Cambridge respectively). A second debate by him on mathematics (\\"quadratic equations\\") was reprinted by the British Association for the History of Mathematics and by the American equivalent body, and is cited by Puzzi in a recent text \\"The Equation They Couldn't Solve\\". The third debate for which McWalter is known was on scientific research. From 2001 he served on the Science and Technology select committee. At his initiative the committee reported in 2004 on the inadequacy of the current research council arrangements for funding research which would be of most immediate use for African countries: The report was strongly commended by the then secretary of state for international development (Hilary Benn) but despite that the report's fundamental recommendation (to inaugurate a research council especially for subjects germane to the interests of developing nations) was not acted on. Following the report McWalter hosted a \\"Science for Africa\\" debate, but he could not extract from the Minister an agreement to work to change research council structures. McWalter was one of the \\"Iraq 139\\", the one hundred and thirty nine Labour MPs who voted against the principal resolution on the Iraq war on 20 March 2003. Personal life He married Karen Omer on 30 March 1991. He has one stepson and two daughters.

The film has a sequel entitled Yossi ( Yossi's Story) released in 2012 that picks up the story a number of years after the events in the first film. Plot Yossi (Ohad Knoller) commands a company of soldiers in the snow-covered mountains near Lebanon. In secrecy, he leads a passionate romantic relationship with his second-in-command officer, Lior (Yehuda Levi), who is called Jagger by everyone for his rock star-like handsomeness and his lip-syncing Mick Jagger. The pair, Yossi and Jagger, lead a loving, yet secret life together, venturing off to be alone and open with one another. One day, a colonel (Sharon Raginiano) arrives at the base with two female soldiers, one of whom he immediately sleeps with in the bunker. The other one, Yaeli (Aya Koren, credited as Aya Steinovitz), is very interested in Jagger, while she refuses the sexual advances of Ofir (Asi Cohen), who tries to make clear to her that Jagger is not particularly interested in her. The colonel is there to supervise a night-time ambush, of which Yossi is resentful because of the full moon, and also because he fears for his soldiers' safety. And indeed Jagger is fatally injured that night, dying in the arms of his lover, who only now is able to articulate his love for him.

Prior to being granted a peerage, he was the Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Bassetlaw from the 2001 general election until 28 October 2019. Mann has served on the Treasury Select Committee. He had previously been the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Tessa Jowell and Richard Caborn. Mann is also a prominent campaigner against antisemitism. On 7 September 2019, he announced that he would not stand as an MP at the next general election and would instead take up full-time role his role as the government's independent adviser on antisemitism, at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, which he had been appointed to on 23 July 2019. On 9 September 2019, Mann was nominated to become a life peer and a member of the House of Lords by former Prime Minister Theresa May in her resignation honours list. He resigned his Commons seat on 28 October. He will not be affiliated to a political party in the House of Lords although he will maintain his membership of the Labour Party. Early life and career Mann is the son of Brenda (n√©e Cleavin) and James Mann. He attended Waterloo Infants school and Pudsey Waterloo Junior school in Pudsey, Yorkshire, then won a County Council scholarship to the private Bradford Grammar School. He holds a degree in Economics from the University of Manchester and a Diploma in Training Management. Active in the Labour Party from his youth (Pudsey South Labour Party), he was formerly a councillor in the London Borough of Lambeth. He was chair of the National Organisation of Labour Students in 1983 and 1984, and as a consequence a member of Labour's National Executive Committee. He subsequently co-authored a Fabian Society tract on the organisation of Labour's youth wing, which formed the basis of the later reorganisation of the youth wing by Tom Sawyer to reduce the influence of Militant tendency. Before entering Parliament he worked for the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union as Head of Research and Education and as the National Training Officer at the TUC National Education Centre in North London (now defunct). Mann was national trade union officer for the 1997 general election. He also was involved in running a family business organising international conferences, interpretation, translation, microphone hire and sound systems, alongside his trades union work. Parliamentary career Mann sought and failed to be selected as Labour candidate in a by-election for the Yorkshire South constituency for the European Parliament in 1998, losing out to Linda McAvan who went on to win the by-election. Mann was first elected as MP for Bassetlaw at the 2001 general election after the previous MP Joe Ashton retired, and retained his seat at each subsequent election in which he stood. Mann was the first Labour MP to call for Gordon Brown to resign after the 2010 general election. Mann was also vocal in criticising other MPs over the expenses scandal, arguing that they could not be trusted to self-regulate. He criticised the shredding of documents related to expenses before 2010, saying \\"it looks like MPs trying to protect MPs again\\". He was also responsible for lodging the complaint that resulted in an inquiry into Maria Miller's expense claims. During the 2015 leadership campaign, he wrote an open letter to Jeremy Corbyn saying that it would be \\"inappropriate\\" for him to become Labour leader due to allegations that he had failed to act over allegations of child abuse in his constituency. Just over two months after Corbyn had won the leadership campaign, Mann continued to refuse to back him in an interview with the BBC, indicating he had no confidence in him. Instead, he said that he had confidence in the then shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn.\\"Labour MP John Mann refuses to back Jeremy Corbyn\\" . BBC News. 18 November 2015. Retrieved 12 July 2017. He supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Corbyn in the 2016 Labour leadership election. Mann has faced criticism for allegedly perpetuating racial stereotypes in an out of print booklet he produced on antisocial behaviour in 2007. The criticisms were dismissed by Nottinghamshire Police in 2017. Drug policy One of Mann's earliest campaigns in his constituency was his inquiry into heroin use in the area. In September 2002, Mann called for more treatment for heroin users in North Nottinghamshire. The inquiry he instigated called for heroin addicts to be given the choice between treatment or prison. At the same time more local GPs were trained to help heroin addicts get their lives back under control. Following the reforms the number of addicts in treatment in Bassetlaw rose from 2 to 400, and acquisitive crime fell by 75%. Following a local newspaper story in October 2005,\\"Legal, but this is no party drug says net\\" . Worksop Guardian. 14 October 2015. Retrieved 12 July 2017. Mann raised an Early Day Motion calling for Salvia divinorum to be banned in the UK (EDM796). The motion only received 11 signatures.Early day motion 796 . Parliament UK. Retrieved 12 July 2017. It was later reported Mann had written to the Home Secretary in October 2008, urging her to take action with regard to salvia's legal status. The same report said that the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs had met to discuss salvia, among other substances, in April 2009, and that there would be a follow-up meeting in May. The Observer newspaper gave the content of Mann's letter to Jacqui Smith. \\"Sadly the issue has come to light again as our young people are using the internet and sites like YouTube to broadcast their friends taking the drug and witnessing the hallucinogenic effects. Our young people are at risk and a wider cultural attachment to this drug seems to be developing that I am sure you agree - regardless of its legal status - needs nipping in the bud\\". Local campaigns Mann was an active campaigner in his constituency of Bassetlaw, and an advocate of using campaigning strategies he refers to as \\"organising to win\\" elsewhere. He has organised numerous campaigns in his constituency, examples of which include, during 2003 and 2004, campaigning to save Bassetlaw Hospital Accident and Emergency Department, helping former coal miners fight double charging solicitors to get their compensation back, and fighting Bassetlaw District Council's policy of \\"topple testing\\" headstones in local cemeteries. Mann kept a weekly column in the Worksop Guardian and ‚Äì along with other local figures ‚Äì wrote occasional pieces for the Retford Times. Operation Midland In December 2014, Mann gave a dossier, compiled by him and containing child sexual abuse allegations against 22 high-profile individuals, to the Metropolitan Police, which as part of Operation Midland was pursuing investigations into homicide and child abuse allegedly committed some decades previously at the Dolphin Square apartment building in Pimlico, London. Mann said that he had made a detailed examination of hundreds of pieces of evidence from members of the public and that he believed some of the twelve former ministers named were \\"definitely child abusers\\". He said that evidence against half of those on the list was \\"very compelling\\" and that some could \\"definitely be prosecuted\\". Operation Midland was closed in 2016 when the allegations were found to be false. Antisemitism Mann has described antisemitism as \\"the worst of racisms\\", and chaired the All-Party Parliamentary Group against Antisemitism during 2004‚Äì2019. In May 2009, Mann received the American Jewish Committee's Jan Karski Award in recognition of his commitment to fighting antisemitism in all of its forms. (speech transcript ) On 28 April 2016, Mann confronted Ken Livingstone in a public stairwell in front of a news camera crew, calling him a \\"Nazi apologist\\" and a \\"fucking disgrace\\" over Livingstone's remarks in a radio interview that Adolf Hitler, on coming to power, supported Jewish emigration to Palestine. Labour's chief whip, Rosie Winterton, told Mann it was \\"completely inappropriate for Labour members of Parliament to be involved in very public rows on the television\\". Mann wrote in The Jewish Chronicle in early May 2016: \\"If Labour cannot combat racism then we are nothing ‚Äì and racism always includes antisemitism. If we cannot do that now, then we have no reason to exist\\". In June 2017, he criticised Corbyn as \\"a man who claims he's dedicated his entire life to racism\\" but was \\"not prepared to make a speech exclusively, explicitly, just on antisemitism\\". In September 2019, upon his announcement that he was leaving the Commons, Mann said he would \\"never forgive\\" Corbyn, believing he had allowed the party to be \\"hijacked\\" by antisemitic bigots. In July 2019, Prime Minister Theresa May appointed Mann as a government advisor on antisemitism. In September 2019, Mann announced that he was taking up a full-time role as the government's antisemitism tsar. Brexit Mann announced he would vote to leave the EU in the June 2016 referendum, saying he believed Labour voters \\"fundamentally disagree\\" with Labour's official stance.\\"Why I'm Voting Out on June 23rd\\" - John Mann MP official website, 10 June 2016 His own constituency voted to leave by a margin of 68% to 32%. Mann was one of only three Labour MPs, along with Ian Austin and Kevin Barron, to defy a three-line whip and to vote for Theresa May's Brexit deal in the 15 January 2019 Meaningful vote. On 29 January 2019, Mann was one of seven Labour MPs to vote with the Conservative Government supporting Graham Brady's amendment mandating Theresa May to renegotiate the Irish backstop in the Withdrawal Agreement. The other six MPs were Austin, Barron, Jim Fitzpatrick, Roger Godsiff, Kate Hoey and Graham Stringer. On 3 April 2019, Mann was one of twelve Labour and ex-Labour MPs to vote alongside the Conservatives against the Cooper Bill, which had been supported by the Labour Party. Nonetheless, the bill passed the House of Commons with a difference of one vote. On 3 September 2019, Mann and Hoey were the only Labour MPs to vote with the Government in an attempt to prevent MPs from taking control of the house to block a potential no-deal Brexit, saying \\"I didn't vote with the government. I voted against an amendment that is deliberately calculated to block Brexit\\". House of Lords On 7 September 2019, Mann announced that he would not stand as an MP at the next general election to take up a full-time role as the government's antisemitism tsar, citing his belief that Corbyn was unfit to become Prime Minister for his mishandling of allegations of antisemitism within the Labour Party. Two days later, it was reported in The Times that Theresa May's resignation honours list was held up by a row over her decision to give Mann a life peerage and that the independent watchdog on Lords appointments warned it would set a dangerous precedent and could be seen as a bribe for his support of her Brexit withdrawal bill. He was created Baron Mann, of Holbeck Moor in the City of Leeds, on 28 October 2019, and was introduced to the House of Lords the next day. Personal life Mann married Joanna White in July 1986 in Leeds. White is a Labour councillor and deputy leader of Bassetlaw District Council, and was employed by her husband as a part-time office manager, remunerated through his parliamentary expenses. The couple have two adult daughters and a son. He supports Leeds United.

Education Marshall was born into a working-class family in the Attercliffe district of Sheffield. He was educated at Sheffield City Grammar School (now called The City School) on Orchard Lane and the University of Leeds, gaining a BSc in Physics in 1963 and PhD in 1968 and working as a research scientist at the Wool Industries Research Association (became the Wira Technology Group, then British Textile Technology Group) in West Park, Leeds from 1963 to 1967. He was a councillor on Leeds City Council from 1965 to 1969. Politics In 1968, he became a lecturer at Leicester Polytechnic remaining until 1974, and in 1971 he was elected to Leicester City Council, becoming leader of the council in 1973. He contested the Harborough seat in 1970. In the February general election of 1974 he contested the constituency of Leicester South, and unseated the Conservative MP, Tom Boardman, in the October election that year. He held the seat until his death, with the exception of the period 1983‚Äì1987, when he lost the seat to the Conservative Derek Spencer by seven votes. During his time out of parliament, he worked as a supply teacher and market trader: building up a stronger, more community oriented reputation. Marshall was an assistant whip between 1977 and the end of James Callaghan's government in 1979. In opposition, he was assistant home affairs spokesman from 1982 to 1983, and deputy shadow spokesman on Northern Ireland from 1987 to 1992. In 1992, he voted for Bryan Gould, seen as the leftwing candidate in the leadership election which followed the resignation of Neil Kinnock. The victorious candidate, John Smith, dispensed with Marshall's services, and Marshall's support for Margaret Beckett in the following leadership election did not endear him to Tony Blair. Increasingly out of step with the mainstream of the Labour Party, he concentrated on constituency matters, and rebelled against Blair's government on many occasions, chiefly on matters relating to immigration and education. His constituency work, especially on immigration and benefit problems, won him strong personal support among local voters. Labour party chairman Ian McCartney described him as \\"a hard-working and dedicated member of parliament who spoke up for his Leicester constituents and did a great deal to help to transform their communities and the opportunities open to them.\\" Personal life and death Marshall married Shirley Ellis on 9 June 1962 in Sheffield, and they had a son and daughter. They divorced and he married Susan Carter on 15 July 1986 in Leicester. Marshall died suddenly and unexpectedly of a heart attack, precipitating a by-election dominated by the invasion of Iraq (which he had opposed).

(Porcia \\"of Cato\\", in full Porcia Catonis filia, \\"Porcia the daughter of Cato\\") also known simply as Porcia, occasionally spelled \\"Portia\\", especially in 18th-century English literature,Spelled Portia in Lempriere's Classical Dictionary (19th century) was a Roman woman who lived in the 1st century BC. She was the daughter of Marcus Porcius Cato Uticensis and his first wife Atilia. She is best known for being the second wife of Marcus Junius Brutus, the most famous of Julius Caesar's assassins, and for her suicide, reputedly by swallowing hot coals. Biography=Early life Porcia from Guillaume Rouill√©'s Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum . Porcia was born between 73 BCPlutarch, Cato the Younger, 7.3.Plutarch, Cato the Younger, 7.4 and 64 BC.Plutarch, Cato the Younger, 24.3 She had an affectionate nature,Plutarch, Marcus Brutus, 13.4. Porcia, being of an affectionate nature... and full of sensible pride. was addicted to philosophy and was full of an understanding courage.Plutarch, Marcus Brutus, 13.4. Plutarch describes her as being prime of youth and beauty.Plutarch, Cato the Younger, 25.3. When she was still very young, her father divorced her mother for adultery. At a young age she was married first to Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, her father's political ally. This marriage occurred between 58 BC and 53 BC. With him she may have had a son, Lucius Calpurnius Bibulus,Plutarch, Marcus Brutus, 13.3. although most modern historians believe Porcia was too young to have mothered Lucius, and that he was Bibulus' son by his previous marriage, as he was old enough to fight in the battle of Philippi in 42 BC. He died in 32 BC. It is possible that a son of Porcia and Bibulus was the man who wrote the biography of Brutus. A few years later, Quintus Hortensius desired to make an alliance with Cato and asked for Porcia's hand in marriage.Plutarch, Cato the Younger, 25.2. Bibulus, who was infatuated with his wife, was unwilling to let her go. Hortensius offered to marry her and then return her to Bibulus once she had given birth to an heir. Such an arrangement was not uncommon at the time.Plutarch, Cato the Younger, 25.3 He argued that it was against natural law to keep a girl of Porcia's youth and beauty from producing children for his allies and impractical for her to overproduce for Bibulus.Plutarch, Cato the Younger, 25.3. \\"According to the opinion of men, he argued, such a course was absurd, but according to the law of nature it was honourable and good for the state that a woman in the prime of youth and beauty should neither quench her productive power and lie idle, nor yet, by bearing more offspring than enough, burden and impoverish a husband who does not want them.\\" Nonetheless Bibulus refused to divorce her and Cato disliked the idea of marrying his daughter to a man who was four times her age. Instead, Cato divorced his wife, Porcia's stepmother Marcia, and gave her to Hortensius; he remarried her after Hortensius died. In 52 BC, Julius Caesar's Gallic Wars came to an end, but he refused to return to Rome, despite the Senate's demands that he lay down his arms. Cato personally detested Caesar, and was his greatest enemy in the Senate; Cato's political faction, the Optimates (also known as the Boni), believed that Caesar should return to Rome, in order for the Optimates to strip him of his property and dignitas, and permanently exile Caesar. In 49 BC, Caesar crossed the Rubicon with his army, thus declaring war, beginning the Great Roman Civil War. Both Cato and Bibulus allied with Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus against Caesar. Though both Boni hated Pompey, he did not pose the threat to their faction that Caesar did. Bibulus commanded Pompey's navy in the Adriatic Sea.Plutarch, Cato the Younger, 54.4. He captured a part of Caesar's fleet, although this was generally insignificant as Caesar went on to decisively defeat Pompey at the Battle of Pharsalus. Bibulus died in 48 BC following Pompey's defeat, leaving Porcia a widow. In 46 BC, Cato committed suicide following his defeat in the battle of Thapsus while Marcus Cato, Porcia's brother, was pardoned by Caesar and returned to Rome.Appian, The Civil Wars, Book II, 100. Marriage to Brutus Brutus, Porcia's first cousin, divorced his wife Claudia Pulchra and married Porcia when she was still very young.Cicero, Brutus, 77. 94 The marriage was scandalous as Brutus did not state any reasons for divorce despite having been married to Claudia for many years. Claudia was very popular for being a woman of great virtue, and was the daughter of Appius Claudius Pulcher, who had been Brutus' ally for many years.Cicero, Atticus, 13. 16 She was also related to Pompey by marriage through her younger sister. The divorce was not well received by some, including Brutus' mother, Servilia,Cicero, Atticus, 13. 10 who despised her half-brother, and appears to have been jealous of Brutus' affection for Porcia.Cicero, Atticus, 13. 22 Therefore, Servilia supported Claudia's interests against those of Porcia.Middleton, Conyers. History of the Life of Marcus Tullus Cicero, The. p 208 On the other hand, Porcia was highly favoured with the followers of both Pompey and Cato, so the marriage was favoured by people such as Marcus Tullius Cicero and Titus Pomponius Atticus.Cicero, Atticus, 13. 9 The marriage was Brutus' way of honouring his uncle. Nonetheless, it appears that Porcia deeply loved Brutus and was utterly devoted to him. She resolved not to inquire into Brutus' secrets before she had made a trial of herself and that she would bid defiance to pain. She and Brutus had a son, who died in 43 BC. Brutus, along with many other co-conspirators, murdered Caesar in 44 BC.Cassius Dio, 44.13.1. He promised to share the \\"heavy secrets\\" of his heart with his wife but it is unclear if he ever got the chance.Cassius Dio, 44.13.Plutarch, Marcus Brutus, 14.4 Some historians believe Porcia may have known about the plot, and may have even been involved in the conspiracy itself.Plutarch, Cato the Younger, 73.4. Plutarch claims that she happened upon Brutus while he was pondering over what to do about Caesar and asked him what was wrong. When he did not answer, she suspected that he distrusted her on account of her being a woman, for fear she might reveal something, however unwillingly, under torture. In order to prove herself to him, she secretly inflicted a wound upon her own thigh with a barber's knife to see if she could endure the pain. As a result of the wound, she suffered from violent pains, chills and fever.Plutarch, Marcus Brutus, 13.5 Some believe that she endured the pain of her untreated wound for at least a day. As soon as she overcame her pain, she returned to Brutus and said: Brutus marveled when he saw the gash on her thigh and after hearing this he no longer hid anything from her, but felt strengthened himself and promised to relate the whole plot.Cassius Dio, 44.14.1 Lifting his hands above him, he is said to have prayed that he might succeed in his undertaking and thus show himself a worthy husband.Plutarch, Marcus Brutus, 13.11. Yet Brutus never got the chance as they were interrupted and never had a moment's privacy before the conspiracy was carried out. On the day of Caesar's assassination, Porcia was extremely disturbed with anxiety and sent messengers to the Senate to check that Brutus was still alive.Plutarch, Marcus Brutus, 15.6. She worked herself up to the point whereupon her fainting, her maids feared that she was dying. When Brutus and the other assassins fled Rome to Athens, it was agreed that Porcia should stay in Italy.Plutarch, Marcus Brutus, 23.2. Porcia was overcome with grief to part from Brutus, but tried hard to conceal it. When she came across a painting depicting the parting of Hector from Andromache in the Iliad, however, she burst into tears.Plutarch, Marcus Brutus, 23.4. Brutus' friend Acilius heard of this, and quoted Homer where Andromache speaks to Hector: Brutus smiled, saying he would never say to Porcia what Hector said to Andromache in return (Ply loom and distaff and give orders to thy maids), saying of Porcia: Death The suicide of Porcia, Pierre Mignard. Museum of Fine Arts of Rennes. Porcia's death has been a fixation for many historians and writers. It was believed by a majority of the contemporary historians that Porcia committed suicide in 42 BC, reputedly by swallowing hot coals. Modern historians find this tale implausible, however, and one popular speculation has Porcia taking her life by burning charcoal in an unventilated room and thus succumbing to carbon monoxide poisoning.Roman Life in the Days of Cicero, Alfred J. Church The exact timing of her death is also a problem. Most contemporary historians (Cassius Dio, Valerius Maximus, and Appian) claim that she killed herself after hearing that Brutus had died following the second battle of Philippi.Cassius Dio, Roman History. 47.49.3.Appian, The Civil Wars, Book 5.136.Valerius Maximus, De factis mem. iv.6.5.Plutarch, Cato the Younger, 53.5. Nicolaus says it happened before Brutus' death, however, saying she died following the first battle of Philippi, claiming that she only thought he was dead, and that Brutus wrote a letter to their friends in Rome, blaming them for Porcia's suicide. Plutarch dismisses Nicolaus' claims of a letter stating that too much was disclosed in the letter for it to be genuine.Plutarch, Marcus Brutus, 53.7. Plutarch also repeats the story of swallowing charcoal, but disbelieves it:See also: Wills, Garry (2011), Rome and Rhetoric: Shakespeare's Julius Caesar ; New Haven and London: Yale University Press, pg 137. > As for Porcia, the wife of Brutus, Nicola√ºs the philosopher, as well as > Valerius Maximus, relates that she now desired to die, but was opposed by > all her friends, who kept strict watch upon her; whereupon she snatched up > live coals from the fire, swallowed them, kept her mouth fast closed, and > thus made away with herself. And yet there is extant a letter of Brutus to > his friends in which he chides them with regard to Porcia and laments her > fate, because she was neglected by them and therefore driven by illness to > prefer death to life. It would seem, then, that Nicola√ºs was mistaken in the > time of her death, since her distemper, her love for Brutus, and the manner > of her death, are also indicated in the letter, if, indeed, it is a genuine > one.Plutarch, Brutus; 53: 5-7. According to the political journalist and classicist Garry Wills, although Shakespeare has Porcia die by the method Plutarch repeats, but rejects, \\"the historical Porcia died of illness (possibly of plague) a year before the battle of Philippi\\"Wills (2011), Op. cit., pg 138 and ‚ÄúPorcia‚Äôs illness and death are reported in Cicero‚Äôs correspondence.‚Äù: Op. cit., Note 18, pg 174: Cicero, Ad Brutum, I.9.2 and I.17.7....‚Äúbut Valerius Maximus [mistakenly] wrote that she killed herself at news of Brutus‚Äôs death in that battle. This was the version of the story celebrated in works like Martial's Epigram 1.42.\\"Wills, Op. cit., citing: Valerius Maximus, Libri Novem, 4.6.5. Also see: Peter Howell (1989), A Commentary on Book One of the Epigrams of Martial (London: Athlone), pp 199-203. The claim that Porcia's death occurred before that of Brutus is backed up by a letter sent by Cicero. This letter would have been sent in late June or early July 43 BC, before either battle of Philippi.Cicero, Ad Brutum, 1.9.2. It further suggests that Porcia did not commit suicide, but died of some lingering illness. As Plutarch states, if the letter was genuine Brutus lamented her death and blamed their friends for not looking after her. There is also an earlier letter from Brutus to Atticus, which hints at Porcia's illness and compliments him for taking care of her.Ad Brut., 17, Valetudinem Porcia me√¶ tibi cur√¶ esse, non minorHistory of the Life of Marcus Tullus Cicero, The. Middleton, Conyers. p 278 Cicero later wrote his surviving letter to Brutus, consoling him in his grief.Cicero, Ad Brutum, 1.9, saying \\"You have suffered indeed a great loss (for you have lost that which had not left its fellow on earth), and must be allowed to grieve under so cruel a blow, lest to want all sense of grief should be thought more wretched than grief itself: but do it with moderation, is both useful to others and necessary to yourself.\\" This is probably the most accurateCicero, Ad Brutum, 1.9.2 includes a contemporary letter, which Cicero sent to Brutus, consoling him over Porcia's death. As this is addressed to her husband it is fair to assume this is one of the more accurate accounts of Porcia Catonis' death. account of Porcia's death.  Portia in popular culture  Portia, played by Deborah Kerr, and James Mason as Marcus Brutus, in the 1953 film Julius Caesar LiteratureClassic= *In Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, she appears in fictionalised form as Brutus' wife.Not to be confused with Portia She makes only two appearances. Portia and Calpurnia are the only two substantial female roles in the play. It is reported in the fourth act that she died by swallowing fire. *Portia is also briefly mentioned in Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice in regards to the character of her namesake, Portia: : In Belmont is a lady richly left; : And she is fair, and, fairer than that word, : Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes : I did receive fair speechless messages: : Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued : To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia.The Merchant of Venice. Shakespeare, William. 1.1.161-66 *In Robert Garnier's play Porcie, she is the heroine of the play, which describes her suicide. In the play, she is devastated to hear of the death of her husband and kills herself. Her servant announces to the Romans that Portia died swallowing live coals, before taking her own life with a dagger. *In The Purgatory of Suicide by Thomas Cooper, Portia is one of the suicides spoken of in the poem. Here Portia's life is compared to the death of Arria, P≈ìtus' wife.Purgatory of Suicides, Book 11. Cooper, Thomas. Page 239. 26. These, side by side,‚Äî Portia and Arria,‚Äîo'er the plain, conversing hied. =Modern= *In Masters of Rome, a series of seven novels by the Australian writer Colleen McCullough, Portia appears as a child in Caesar's Women, as a teenager in Caesar and as a young woman in The October Horse. Portia is portrayed as being, first a rabid unthinking follower of republican values, then as a raving maniac, and then as perhaps totally insane. Servilia, who abuses her constantly, later writes to Brutus before the battle of Philippi to inform him that Portia went mad and killed herself by swallowing live coals. Brutus, however, recognizes that it is more likely that Servilia murdered Portia by forcing burning coals down her throat. Given the vicious character of Servilia in the novel, this murder is perfectly believable. *She appears in The Ides of March, an epistolary novel by Thornton Wilder, describing the events leading up to the death of Julius Caesar. Portia is one of the main characters in fourth part of the book. Cicero speaks of her as the only person that Brutus loves. Portia and Servilia exchange several letters, hinting towards Servilia's dislike of her. Caesar later sends a letter to Portia informing her that Brutus is returning to Rome, and Portia replies with a polite thank you; Caesar later confesses to Lucius Mamilius Turrinus (the chief character) that he greatly envies Brutus his marriage to her and often wishes he could have married her himself. *She is referenced in The Stars' Tennis Balls by Stephen Fry. As part of his revenge, Simon Cotter gives Oliver Delft, the policeman who had him imprisoned, an alternative to being imprisoned himself. The alternative is for Delft to kill himself, with hot coals, as Portia did in Julius Caesar. Drama *Portia has been played in various adaptations of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. Actresses such as Deborah Kerr, Virginia McKenna and Diana Rigg have played the part in movies and television productions.Internet Movie Database search on character name Portia *Portia appears as a child and as an adult in the 2003 miniseries Julius Caesar. She is portrayed by Kate Steavenson-Payne as an adult. She is a companion to her cousin Brutus and later becomes his wife. The drama shows her as an unwilling pawn in Caesar's assassination, torn between her husband and her friend, Calpurnia.

At its core, the anti-pattern consists of a system partitioned into two parts: user interface and business logic, that are coupled through a single point, clicking the \\"magic pushbutton\\" or submitting a form of data. As it is a single point interface, this interface becomes over-complicated to implement. The temporal coupling of these units is a major problem: every interaction in the user interface must happen before the pushbutton is pressed, business logic can only be applied after the button was pressed. Cohesion of each unit also tends to be poor: features are bundled together whether they warrant this or not, simply because there is no other structured place in which to put them.  Drawbacks = For users  To a user, a magic pushbutton system appears clumsy and frustrating to use. Business logic is unavailable before the button press, so the user interface appears as a bland form-filling exercise. There is no opportunity for assistance in filling out fields, or for offering drop-down lists of acceptable values. In particular, it is impossible to provide assistance with later fields, based on entries already placed in earlier fields. For instance, a choice from a very large list of insurance claim codes might be filtered to a much smaller list, if the user has already selected Home/Car/Pet insurance, or if they have already entered their own identification and so the system can determine the set of risks for which they're actually covered, omitting the obscure policies that are now known to be irrelevant for this transaction. One of the most off-putting aspects of a magic pushbutton is its tendency for the user interaction to proceed by entering a large volume of data, then having it rejected for some unexpected reason. This is particularly poor design when it is combined with the infamous \\"Redo from scratch\\" messages of older systems. Even where a form is returned with the entered data preserved and the problem field highlighted, it is still off-putting to users to have to return to a field that they thought they had completed some minutes earlier. These features, and their lack with a magic pushbutton, are particularly important for naive users who are likely to make mistakes, less so for experts or the system's own programmers. This type of interface failing has been highlighted by the web, and the need to support more public users, rather than a more traditional user group of role-based office workers, carrying out the same tasks on the same system, over and over. Even though a developer who knows the system intimately and can enter data perfectly the first time round is able to use it efficiently, this is no indication that such a system is suitable for use by its actual users.  For implementation  The magic pushbutton often arises through poor management of the design process in the early stages, together with a lack of importance placed on user experience, relative to project completion. At a simple view, the simplicity of the magic pushbutton is attractive as it has few user interface modules and their interactions appear simple too. This view hides the complexity inside each module, and also devalues interface quality relative to cost.  Alternatives  In a modern system, i.e. one where processing is cheap and competing interface standards are high, users should simply not be left to enter data for long periods without some automatic interaction to guide, validate, or to tailor the system according to the developing state of the data they've so far entered. Leaving them alone to \\"just get on with it\\", then validating everything at the end, means that the corrections needed will be detected further and further from when that data was entered. As an a priori principle, corrections needed should be highlighted as soon and as close to when they are either entered, or could first be identified. In an event-driven interface, most events triggered by the \\"completion\\" of a field will present an opportunity to either validate that field, or to guide the choices for entering the next. They may even control which field the user is taken to next: sub-sections of a form are often made relevant or irrelevant by values entered early on, and users should not need to manually skip these, if it can be done for them. In this scenario, the programmer draws the user interface first and then writes the business logic in the automatically created methods.  Example  The following is a typical example of a magic pushbutton in Borland Delphi: procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject); var reg: TRegistry; begin reg := TRegistry.Create; try reg.RootKey := HKey_Current_User; if reg.OpenKey('\\\\Software\\\\MyCompany', true) then begin reg.WriteString('Filename', Edit1.Text); end; finally reg.Free; end; end; A better way to do this is to refactor the business logic (in this example storing the filename to the registry) into a separate class. type TPreferences = class private FFilename: String; procedure SetFilename(const Value: String); public property Filename: String read FFilename write SetFilename; procedure Load; procedure Save; end; and call this class Save method from the Click handler: procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject); begin Preferences.Save; end; procedure TForm1.Edit1Change(Sender: TObject); begin Preferences.Filename := Edit1.Text; end; References Category:Anti-patterns Category:Articles with example code ","title":"Magic pushbutton"},{"id":"434754","text":"Transience or Transient may refer to: Music * Transient (album), a 2004 album by Gaelle * Transience (album), a 2015 album by Steven Wilson Science and engineering * Transient (acoustics), a high-amplitude, short-duration sound at the beginning of a waveform * Transient (astronomy), an astronomical object or phenomenon of short duration * Transient (civil engineering), any pressure wave that is short lived * Transient (computer programming), a property of any element in the system that is temporary * Transient (oscillation), a short-lived burst of energy caused by a sudden change of state Other * \\"Transience\\" (short story), by Arthur C.

The Pan-American Highway also has a corresponding gap of , beginning at Turbo, Colombia, and ending at Yaviza, Panama. Roadbuilding through this area is expensive and detrimental to the environment. Political consensus in favor of road construction collapsed after an initial attempt failed in the early 1970s, resuming in 1992 only to be halted by serious environmental concerns, and to date has not reemerged. The geography of the Dari√©n Gap on the Colombian side is dominated primarily by the river delta of the Atrato River, which creates a flat marshland at least wide. The Serran√≠a del Baud√≥ range extends along Colombia's Pacific coast and into Panama. The Panamanian side, in stark contrast, is a mountainous rainforest, with terrain reaching from in the valley floors to at the tallest peak (Cerro Tacarcuna, in the Serran√≠a del Dari√©n). Pan-American Highway Map of the Dari√©n Gap and the break in the Pan-American Highway between Yaviza, Panama and Turbo, Colombia. The Pan- American Highway is a system of roads measuring about long that crosses through the entirety of North, Central, and South America, with the sole exception of the Dari√©n Gap. On the South American side, the Highway terminates at Turbo, Colombia, near . On the Panamanian side, the road terminus is the town of Yaviza at . This marks a straight-line separation of about . In between are marshland and forest. Efforts have been made for decades to remedy this missing link in the Pan-American Highway. Planning began in 1971 with the help of American funding, but this was halted in 1974 after concerns were raised by environmentalists. Another effort to build the road began in 1992, but by 1994 a United Nations agency reported that the road, and the subsequent development, would cause extensive environmental damage. Cited reasons include evidence that the Dari√©n Gap has prevented the spread of diseased cattle into Central and North America, which have not seen foot-and-mouth disease since 1954, and since at least the 1970s this has been a substantial factor in preventing a road link through the Dari√©n Gap. The Embera-Wounaan and Guna have also expressed concern that the road would bring about the potential erosion of their cultures. Many people, groups, indigenous populations, and governments are opposed to completing the Dari√©n portion of the highway. Reasons for opposition include protecting the rainforest, containing the spread of tropical diseases, protecting the livelihood of indigenous peoples in the area, preventing drug trafficking and its associated violence, and preventing foot-and-mouth disease from entering North America. The extension of the highway as far as Yaviza resulted in severe deforestation alongside the highway route within a decade. One option proposed, in a study by Bio-Pacifico, is a short ferry link from Colombia to a new ferry port in Panama, with an extension of the existing Panama highway that would complete the highway without violating these environmental concerns. Another idea is to use a combination of bridges and tunnels to avoid the environmentally sensitive regions.http://www.futuristspeaker.com/2014/12/the-coming-era-of- mega-systems-part-1-transportation/ The Coming Era of Mega Systems, Part 1 ‚Äì Transportation  History = Pre-Columbian history  thumbMajor areas of pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas: Archaeological knowledge of this area has received relatively little attention compared to its adjoining neighbors to the north and south, despite the fact that in the early 20th century, scholars such as Max Uhle, William Henry Holmes, C. V. Hartman, and George Grant MacCurdy undertook studies of archaeological sites and collections that were augmented by further research by Samuel Kirkland Lothrop, John Alden Mason, Doris Zemurray Stone, William Duncan Strong, Gordon Willey, and others. One of the reasons for the relative lack of attention is the lack of research by locals themselves in this regard. There is a large number of sites with impressive platform mounds, plazas, paved roads, stone sculpture, and artifacts made from jade, gold, and ceramic materials. The Dari√©n Gap is home to the Embera-Wounaan and Kuna (as well as the Cueva before the 16th century). Travel is often conducted with specialized canoes (\\"piragua\\"). On the Panamanian side, La Palma, the area's cultural center is the capital of the province. Other population centers include Yaviza and El Real. The Dari√©n Gap had a reported population of 1,700 in 1980. Maize, cassava, plantains, and bananas are staple crops in local farms. The Cunas lived in what is now Northern Colombia and the Dari√©n Province of Panama at the time of the Spanish conquest, and subsequently began to move westward due to a conflict with the Spanish and other indigenous groups. Centuries before the conquest, the Cunas arrived in South America as part of a Chibchan migration moving east from Central America. At the time of the Spanish invasion, they were living in the region of Uraba near the borders of what are now Antioquia and Caldas. The Cuna themselves attribute their migrations to conflicts with other chiefdoms, and their migration to nearby islands to mosquito populations on the mainland.

The regional border was initially created in 1508 after royal decree, to separate the colonial governorships of Castilla de Oro and Nueva Andaluc√≠a, using the River Atrato as the boundary between the two goverorships.Berrio-Lemm, Vladimir. A short survey of public international law: Limits of Costa Rica and Panama. Page 47. Lottery # 420 Cultural Magazine. September‚ÄìOctober 1998 Balboa heard of the \\"South Sea\\" from locals while sailing along the Caribbean coast. On 25 September 1513, he saw the Pacific. In 1519, the town of Panam√° was founded near a small indigenous settlement on the Pacific coast. After the discovery of Peru, it subsequently developed into an important transshipment port as well as an administrative center. In 1671, the Welsh pirate Henry Morgan crossed the Isthmus of Panam√° from the Caribbean side and destroyed the city; the town was subsequently relocated a few kilometers to the west on a small peninsula. The ruins of the old town, Panam√° Viejo, are preserved and were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997. Silver and gold from the viceroyalty of Peru were transported overland across the isthmus by Spanish Silver Train to Porto Bello, where Spanish treasure fleets shipped them to Seville and C√°diz from 1707. Lionel Wafer spent four years between 1680 and 1684 among the Cuna Indians. In 1698, Scotland tried to establish a settlement through the Darien scheme as part of its sole major attempt at colonialism. The first expedition of five ships (Saint Andrew, Caledonia, Unicorn, Dolphin, and Endeavor) set sail from Leith on 14 July 1698, with around 1,200 people on board. Their orders were \\"to proceed to the Bay of Darien, and make the Isle called the Golden Island ... some few leagues to the leeward of the mouth of the great River of Darien ... and there make a settlement on the mainland\\". After calling at Madeira and the West Indies, the fleet made landfall off the coast of Darien on November 2. The settlers christened their new home \\"New Caledonia\\". The aim was for the colony to have an overland route that connected the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Since its inception, claims have been made that the undertaking was beset by poor planning and provisioning, divided leadership, a poor choice of trade goods, devastating epidemics of disease, reported attempts by the East India Company to frustrate it, as well as a failure to anticipate the Spanish Empire's military response. It was finally abandoned in March 1700 after a siege by Spanish forces, which also blockaded the harbor. As the Company of Scotland was backed by approximately 20% of all the money circulating in Scotland, its failure left the Scottish Lowlands in substantial financial ruin; in fact, English financial incentives were a factor in persuading those in power to support the 1707 Acts of Union.Brocklehurst, \\"The Banker who Led Scotland to Disaster\\". According to this argument, the Scottish establishment (landed aristocracy and mercantile elites) considered that their best chance of being part of a major power would be to share the benefits of England's international trade and the growth of the English overseas possessions, so its future would have to lie in unity with England. Furthermore, Scotland's nobles were almost bankrupted by the Darien fiasco. The current border is regulated by the Victoria-Velez Treaty signed in Bogot√° on 20 August 1924 by the Foreign Ministers of Panama, Nicolas Victoria; and Colombia, Jorge Velez. This treaty is officially registered in the Register No. 814 of the Treaty League of Nations, on 17 August 1925; said border was based on the same Colombian law of 9 June 1855.De Leon, Raquel Maria.

Two major national parks exist in the Dari√©n Gap: Dari√©n National Park in Panama and Los Kat√≠os National Park in Colombia. The Dari√©n Gap forests had extensive cedrela and mahogany cover until many of these trees were removed by loggers.

Copa Airlines Flight 201 On 6 June 1992, Copa Airlines Flight 201, a Boeing 737 jet airplane covering a flight between Panama City and Cali, Colombia, crashed in the Dari√©n Gap, killing all 47 people on board. Crossings of the Dari√©n Gap Embera girl The Gap can be transited by off- road vehicles attempting intercontinental journeys. The first post-colonial expedition to the Dari√©n was the Marsh Darien Expedition in 1924‚Äì25, supported by several major sponsors, including the Smithsonian Institution. The first vehicular crossing of the Gap was made by three Brazilians in two Ford Model Ts. They left Rio de Janeiro in 1928 and arrived in the United States in 1938. The expedition intended to claim attention for the Panamerican highway, after an International Conference in Chile, in 1923. The participants were Leonidas Borges de Oliveira, a lieutenant from Brazilian army, Francisco Lopez da Cruz from Brazilian air force, and M√°rio Fava, a young mechanic. They took what appears to be the last photo of Augusto Sandino, who received them in Nicaragua, and was received by Henry Ford and Franklin Roosevelt in the United States. Their story is available with photos from the book O Brasil atrav√©s das tr√™s Am√©ricas written by Beto Braga. Another crossing was completed by the Land Rover La Cucaracha Cari√±osa (The Affectionate Cockroach) and a Jeep of the Trans-Dari√©n Expedition of 1959‚Äì60, crewed by Amado Ara√∫z (Panama), his wife Reina Torres de Ara√∫z, former Special Air Service man Richard E. Bevir (UK), and engineer Terence John Whitfield (Australia). They left Chepo, Panama, on 2 February 1960 and reached Quibd√≥, Colombia, on 17 June 1960, averaging 201 m (220 yd) per hour over 136 days. They traveled a great deal of the distance up the vast Atrato River. Prudhoe Bay, U.S.A., to Quell√≥n, Chile, and Ushuaia, Argentina, with official and unofficial routes shown in Mexico and Central and South America. A few selected unofficial routes shown through the United States and Canada as they existed in the early 1960s. In 1966, the new U.S. Interstate highway system brought official status to most previously unofficial routes in the lower 48 states. In December 1960, on a motorcycle trip from Alaska to Argentina, adventurer Danny LiskaDanny Liska attempted to transit the Dari√©n Gap from Panama to Colombia.Danny Liska \\"Across the Darien Gap by River and Trail II\\", Peruvian Times, Vol XXI, Num. 1068(June 2, 1961), pg. 10 Liska was forced to abandon his motorcycle and proceed across the Gap by boat and foot. In 1961, a team of three 1961 Chevrolet Corvairs and several support vehicles departed from Panama. The group was sponsored by Dick Doane Chevrolet (a Chicago Chevrolet dealer) and the Chevrolet division of General Motors. After 109 days they reached the Colombia Border with two Corvairs, the third having been abandoned in the jungle. It has been documented by a Jam Handy Productions film along with an article in Automobile Quarterly magazine (Volume 1 number 3, from the fall of 1962). A pair of Range Rovers was used on the British Trans-Americas Expedition in 1972 led by John Blashford-Snell, which is claimed to be the first vehicle-based expedition to traverse both American continents north to south through the Dari√©n Gap. The Expedition crossed the Atrato Swamp in Colombia with the cars on special inflatable rafts that were carried in the backs of the vehicles. However, they received substantial support from the British Army. Blashford-Snell's book, Something Lost Behind the Ranges (Harper Collins) has several chapters on the Dari√©n expedition. The Hundred Days of Darien, a book written by Russell Braddon in 1974, also chronicles this expedition. In addition to the book, a video exists that was filmed by two Vancouver, BC based cameramen, Alan Bibby and Eric Rankin. These cameramen were mentioned in the book several times and can be seen in some of the still photos in the book.This video is available online as Darien Conquest, presented by Forces Network. The first fully overland wheeled crossing (others used boats for some sections) of the Gap was that of British cyclist Ian Hibell, who rode from Cape Horn to Alaska between 1971 and 1973. Hibell took the \\"direct\\" overland south-to-north route, including an overland crossing of the Atrato Swamp in Colombia. Hibell completed his crossing of the Gap accompanied by two New Zealand cycling companions who had ridden with him from Cape Horn, but neither of these continued with Hibell on to Alaska.Hibell's \\"Cape Horn to Alaska\\" expedition forms part of his 1984 book Into the Remote Places. Ed Culberson's \\"Amigo\\" (a BMW R80G/S motorcycle) was the first motor vehicle to fully navigate the Pan-American Highway by land. The first motorcycle crossing was by Robert L. Webb in March 1975. Another four-wheel drive crossing was in 1978‚Äì1979 by Mark A. Smith and his team. They drove the stretch of the gap in 30 days using five stock Jeep CJ-7s, traveling many kilometres up the Atrato River on barges.Smith has since released his book, Driven by a Dream, which documents the crossing. The first all-land auto crossing was in 1985‚Äì87 by Loren Upton and Patty Mercier in a CJ-5 Jeep, taking 741 days to travel . This crossing is documented in the 1992 Guinness Book of Records. Ed Culberson was the first one to follow the entire Pan- American highway including the Dari√©n Gap proposed route on a motorcycle, a BMW R80G/S. From Yaviza, he first followed the Loren Upton team but would go solo just before Pucuru, hiring his own guides.Obsessions Die Hard In the 1990s, the gap was briefly joined by ferry service, provided by Crucero Express, until it ceased operations in 1997. A number of notable crossings have been made on foot. Sebastian Snow crossed the Gap with Wade Davis in 1975 as part of his unbroken walk from Tierra del Fuego to Costa Rica. The trip is documented in his 1976 book The Rucksack Man and in Wade Davis's 1985 book The Serpent and the Rainbow. In 1981, George Meegan crossed the gap on a similar journey. He too started in Tierra del Fuego and eventually ended in Alaska. His 1988 biography, The Longest Walk, describes the trip and includes a 25-page chapter on his foray through the Gap. In 2001, as a part of his Goliath Expedition‚Äîa trek to forge an unbroken footpath from the tip of South America to the Bering Strait and back to his home in England‚ÄîKarl Bushby (UK) crossed the gap on foot, using no transport or boats, from Colombia to Panama. In July 1996, as part of their hitchhiking trip to Ushuaia through 17 Latin American countries, Walter Bl√§s, Ana Cravioto, Albrecht von der Recke and Gustavo Ross crossed from Panama to Colombia, becoming the first Mexicans to cross the Gap on foot, according to the visitors log kept since 1946 in P√∫curo. The night of 28 July they survived the Hurricane Cesar‚ÄìDouglas in the jungle somewhere between Paya and Palo de las Letras. Accompanied by 11 and 13-year-old Lico and Juan from Paya, the survivors reported several big trees falling around them and river levels rising up to 3 meters (10 feet) that night. First Mexican by-foot crossers take a rest by the \\"Lost Corvair\\" abandoned 1961 by failed caravan from Chicago. In 1979, evangelist Arthur Blessitt traversed the gap while carrying a 12-foot wooden cross, a trek confirmed by Guinness World Records as part of \\"the longest round the world pilgrimage\\" for Christ. Traveling alone with a machete plus one backpack crammed with water bottles, a hammock, Bible, notepad, lemon drops, and Blessitt's signature Jesus stickers saying \\"Smile! God Loves you\\", Blessitt describes his experience in a book, The Cross, and in an eponymous full-length movie. Most crossings of the Dari√©n Gap region have been from Panama to Colombia. In July 1961, three college students, Carl Adler, James Wirth, and Joseph Bellina, crossed from the Bay of San Miguel to Puerto Obaldia on the Gulf of Parita (near Colombia) and ultimately to Mulatupu in what was then known as San Blas and now identified as Kuna Yala. The trip across the Dari√©n was by banana boat, piraqua, and foot via the Tuira river (La Palma and El Real de Santa Maria), R√≠o Chucunaque (Yaviza), Rio Tuquesa (Chaua's (General Choco Chief) Trading Post‚ÄîChoco Indian village) and Serran√≠a del Dari√©n.\\"Brought Back Darien Bush\\", Panama Star & Herald], July 9, 1961, pg. 1Carl Adler, \\"A Trip to Panama\\", The Scholastic, Vol. 104, No. 11, January 18, 1963, pg. 18 In 1985, Project Raleigh, which evolved from Project Drake in 1984 and in 1989 became Raleigh International, sponsored an expedition which also crossed the Dari√©n coast to coast.\\"After Trek Through the Jungle Youth's Ready to Go Again\\". Raleigh The News & Observer, June 25, 1985 Their path was similar to the 1961 route above, but in reverse. The expedition started in the Bay of Caledonia at the Serran√≠a del Dari√©n, following the R√≠o Membrillo ultimately to the R√≠o Chucunaque and Yaviza, roughly following the route taken by Balboa in 1513. Between the early 1980s and mid-1990s, Encounter Overland, a British adventure travel company, organized 2‚Äì3 week trekking trips through the Dari√©n Gap from Panama to Colombia or vice versa. These trips used a combination of whatever transport was available: jeeps, bus, boats, and plenty of walking, with travelers carrying their own supplies. These groups were made up of male and female participants from any number of nationalities and age groups, and were led by experienced trek leaders. One leader went on to do nine Dari√©n Gap trips and later acted as a logistics guide and coordinator for the BBC Natural History Unit during the production of a documentary called A Tramp in the Darien, which screened on BBC in 1990‚Äì91. A complete overland crossing of the Dari√©n rainforest on foot and riverboat (i.e., from the last road in Panama to the first road in Colombia) became more dangerous in the 1990s because of the Colombian conflict. The Colombian portion of the Dari√©n rainforest in the Katios Park region eventually fell under control of armed groups. Furthermore, combatants from Colombia even entered Panama, occupied some Panamanian jungle villages and kidnapped or killed inhabitants and travelers. Just as hostilities were starting to worsen, 18-year-old Andrew Egan traversed the Dari√©n Rainforest, detailing the excursion in the book Crossing the Darien Gap. As of 2013, the coastal route on the east side of the Dari√©n Isthmus has become relatively safe. This is by motorboat across the Gulf of Uraba from Turbo to Capurgan√°, and then hopping the coast to Sapzurro and hike from there to La Miel, Panama. Any inland routes through the Dari√©n remain highly dangerous.Crossing the Darien Gap, documentary film (2013, 2016), March 2013. In June 2017, CBS journalist Adam Yamaguchi filmed smugglers leading refugees on a nine-day journey from Colombia to Panama through the Dari√©n. Migrants from Africa, South Asia, the Middle East, and the Caribbean have been known to cross the Dari√©n Gap as a method of migrating to the United States. This route may entail flying to Ecuador (taking advantage of that nation's liberal visa policy), and attempting to cross the gap on foot. The journalist Jason Motlagh was interviewed by Sacha Pfeiffer on NPR's nationally syndicated radio show On Point in 2016 concerning his work following migrants through the Dari√©n Gap. Journalists Nadja Drost and Bruno Federico were interviewed by Nick Schifrin about their work following migrants through the Dari√©n Gap in mid-2019 and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic a year later, as part of a series on migration to the United States for the PBS NewsHour. Armed conflict FARC insurgents in 1998. The Dari√©n Gap was subject to the Marxist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which has undergone an insurgency against the Colombian government. FARC rebels were present on both the Colombian and Panamanian sides of the border. In 2000, two British travelers, Tom Hart Dyke and Paul Winder, were kidnapped by FARC in the Dari√©n Gap while hunting for exotic orchids, plants for which Dyke has a particular passion. The two were held captive for nine months and threatened with death before eventually being released unharmed and without a ransom being paid. Dyke and Winder later documented their experience in the book The Cloud Garden and in an episode of Locked Up Abroad. Other political victims include three New Tribes missionaries, who disappeared from the Panamanian side in 1993. In 2003, Robert Young Pelton, on assignment for National Geographic Adventure magazine, and two traveling companions, Mark Wedeven and Megan Smaker, were detained for one week by the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, a far-right paramilitary organization, in a highly publicized incident. In May 2013, Swedish backpacker Jan Philip Braunisch disappeared in the area after leaving the Colombian town of Riosucio with the intention of attempting a crossing on foot to Panama, via the Cuenca Cacarica. The FARC admitted to killing him, having mistaken him for a foreign spy.

Born in the late Eastern Han dynasty, Zhuge Jin started his career in the 200s as an official under the warlord Sun Quan, who later became the founding emperor of Eastern Wu in the Three Kingdoms period. In 215, he served as Sun Quan's representative in a territorial dispute over southern Jing Province between Sun Quan and his ally, Liu Bei. In 219, he joined Sun Quan's general L√º Meng in an invasion of Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province after Sun Quan broke the Sun‚ÄìLiu alliance. He was subsequently appointed as a general and commandery administrator. Before the Battle of Xiaoting of 221‚Äì222, Zhuge Jin attempted to dissuade Liu Bei from going to war with Sun Quan but was unsuccessful. The battle ultimately concluded with victory for Sun Quan's side; both sides made peace later and reestablished an alliance between the Eastern Wu and Shu Han states against their rival state, Cao Wei. From 222 until his death in 241, despite being rather incompetent in military affairs, Zhuge Jin served as one of Eastern Wu's top generals and participated in some battles against Cao Wei forces. Although Zhuge Jin was not as brilliant in statecraft and military strategy as his more famous brother Zhuge Liang, he was known throughout his life for his virtuous character. He had a reputation for conducting himself with grace and decorum, and for being thoughtful, magnanimous and tactful. In return, he gained Sun Quan's trust, and Sun Quan never questioned his loyalty towards him. Zhuge Jin was also known for helping to mediate conflicts between Sun Quan and his subjects, including Zhu Zhi and Yu Fan. Family background Zhuge Jin's ancestral home (and probably birthplace too) was in Yangdu County (), Langya Commandery (), which is located in present-day Yinan County or Yishui County, Shandong.(Ë´∏ËëõÁëæÂ≠óÂ≠êÁëúÔºåÁêÖÈÇ™ÈôΩÈÉΩ‰∫∫‰πü„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 52. There are two other accounts of his ancestral origins in the Wu Shu () and Fengsu Tong (). The Wu Shu recorded that his ancestral family name was actually Ge () and his ancestors were originally from Zhu County (Ë´∏Á∏£; southwest of present-day Zhucheng, Shandong) before they settled in Yangdu County. As there was already another Ge family in Yangdu County before they came, the locals referred to the newcomers as the Zhuge ‚Äì combining Zhu (County) and Ge ‚Äì to distinguish them from the other Ge family. Over time, Zhuge Liang's ancestors adopted Zhuge as their family name.(Âê≥Êõ∏Êõ∞ÔºöÂÖ∂ÂÖàËëõÊ∞èÔºåÊú¨ÁêÖÈÇ™Ë´∏Á∏£‰∫∫ÔºåÂæåÂæôÈôΩÈÉΩ„ÄÇÈôΩÈÉΩÂÖàÊúâÂßìËëõËÄÖÔºåÊôÇ‰∫∫Ë¨Ç‰πãË´∏ËëõÔºåÂõ†‰ª•ÁÇ∫Ê∞è„ÄÇ) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 52.

During the early Western Han dynasty, Emperor Wen considered that Ge Ying was unjustly put to death, so he enfeoffed Ge Ying's grandson as the Marquis of Zhu County to honour Ge Ying.

The earliest known ancestor of Zhuge Jin who bore the family name Zhuge was Zhuge Feng (), a Western Han dynasty official who served as Colonel-Director of Retainers () under Emperor Yuan ( 48‚Äì33 BCE). Zhuge Jin's father, Zhuge Gui (), whose courtesy name was Jungong (), served as an assistant official in Taishan Commandery (Ê≥∞Â±±ÈÉ°; around present-day Tai'an, Shandong) in the late Eastern Han dynasty under Emperor Ling ( 168‚Äì189 CE).(Ë´∏Ëëõ‰∫ÆÂ≠óÂ≠îÊòéÔºåÁêÖÈÇ™ÈôΩÈÉΩ‰∫∫‰πü„ÄÇÊº¢Âè∏Èö∑Ê†°Â∞âË´∏ËëõË±êÂæå‰πü„ÄÇÁà∂Áè™ÔºåÂ≠óÂêõË≤¢ÔºåÊº¢Êú´ÁÇ∫Â§™Â±±ÈÉ°‰∏û„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 35.

Early life In his youth, Zhuge Jin visited Luoyang, the imperial capital, where he studied classical texts such as the Mao Commentary on the Classic of Poetry, Book of Documents, and Zuo Zhuan. When his mother died, he went home and dutifully performed filial mourning. He also treated his stepmother in a courteous and respectful manner, which earned him fame for his filial piety.(ÁëæÂ∞ëÊ∏∏‰∫¨Â∏´ÔºåÊ≤ªÊØõË©©„ÄÅÂ∞öÊõ∏„ÄÅÂ∑¶Ê∞èÊò•Áßã„ÄÇÈÅ≠ÊØçÊÜÇÔºåÂ±ÖÂñ™Ëá≥Â≠ùÔºå‰∫ãÁπºÊØçÊÅ≠Ë¨πÔºåÁîöÂæó‰∫∫Â≠ê‰πãÈÅì„ÄÇ) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 52.

At the time ( 200s), Sun Quan had recently succeeded his deceased elder brother, Sun Ce, as the warlord ruling over the territories in Jiangdong. Hong Zi, a brother-in-law of Sun Quan, noticed and recognised Zhuge Jin's talent so he recommended Zhuge Jin to serve under Sun Quan. Sun Quan treated Zhuge Jin, Lu Su and other talents who came to join him like honoured guests. Zhuge Jin then started his career under Sun Quan as a Chief Clerk (). Later, he was reassigned to the position of a Central Major ().(Êº¢Êú´ÈÅø‰∫ÇÊ±üÊù±„ÄÇÂÄºÂ≠´Á≠ñÂçíÔºåÂ≠´Ê¨äÂßäÂ£ªÊõ≤ÈòøÂºòÂí®Ë¶ãËÄåÁï∞‰πãÔºåËñ¶‰πãÊñºÊ¨äÔºåËàáÈ≠ØËÇÖÁ≠â‰∏¶Ë¶ãË≥îÂæÖÔºåÂæåÁÇ∫Ê¨äÈï∑Âè≤ÔºåËΩâ‰∏≠Âè∏È¶¨„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 52. Sun‚ÄìLiu territorial dispute Sometime between June and August 215, Sun Quan sent Zhuge Jin as his representative to visit his ally, Liu Bei, who had recently seized control of Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing). Zhuge Jin's task was to ask Liu Bei to \\"return\\" the territories in southern Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan) to Sun Quan, according to an earlier agreement that Liu Bei would only use Jing Province as a temporary base and would return them to Sun Quan once he found another base. However, Liu Bei refused and said he would return the territories after he seized Liang Province. Sun Quan ignored Liu Bei and sent his officials to assume office in the three commanderies of Changsha (), Lingling () and Guiyang () in southern Jing Province. However, Guan Yu, Liu Bei's general in charge of defending those territories, drove Sun Quan's officials away. An enraged Sun Quan then ordered his general L√º Meng to lead 20,000 troops to seize the three commanderies by force. After a standoff between both sides and tense negotiations, Liu Bei agreed to divide southern Jing Province between his and Sun Quan's domains along the Xiang River: Liu Bei would keep Nan, Lingling and Wuling commanderies in the west, while Sun Quan would take Changsha, Jiangxia and Guiyang commanderies in the east. The territorial dispute was resolved by mid August to early September 215. Sun Quan then sent Zhuge Jin as his representative to visit Liu Bei again. During this trip, Zhuge Jin met his second brother Zhuge Liang, who was serving as an adviser to Liu Bei. They refrained from meeting each other in private(Âª∫ÂÆâ‰∫åÂçÅÂπ¥ÔºåÊ¨äÈÅ£Áëæ‰ΩøËúÄÈÄöÂ•ΩÂäâÂÇôÔºåËàáÂÖ∂Âºü‰∫Æ‰ø±ÂÖ¨ÊúÉÁõ∏Ë¶ãÔºåÈÄÄÁÑ°ÁßÅÈù¢„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 52. to dispel any suspicions that either of them was secretly collaborating with his brother against his lord. Role in the Wu‚ÄìShu conflict=Wu invasion of Jing Province In 219, Sun Quan broke the Sun‚ÄìLiu alliance and ordered his general L√º Meng to lead troops to seize Liu Bei's territories in southern Jing Province, which were guarded by Liu Bei's general Guan Yu, who was away at the Battle of Fancheng at the time. Zhuge Jin participated in the invasion, which turned out successful. Guan Yu was eventually captured and executed by Sun Quan's forces. L√º Meng died of illness a few months after the victory. In recognition of Zhuge Jin's contributions during the campaign, Sun Quan enfeoffed him as the Marquis of Xuancheng () and appointed him as General Who Pacifies the South () to replace L√º Meng as the Administrator () of Nan Commandery (ÂçóÈÉ°; around present-day Jingzhou, Hubei), the former headquarters of Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province. Zhuge Jin was stationed at Gong'an County, one of the key counties in Nan Commandery.(ÂæåÂæûË®éÈóúÁæΩÔºåÂ∞ÅÂÆ£Âüé‰æØÔºå‰ª•Á∂èÂçóÂ∞áËªç‰ª£ÂëÇËíôÈ†òÂçóÈÉ°Â§™ÂÆàÔºå‰ΩèÂÖ¨ÂÆâ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 52. In 220, Cao Pi usurped the throne from Emperor Xian, ended the Eastern Han dynasty, and established the state of Cao Wei (or Wei) with himself as the new emperor. This event marked the end of the Eastern Han dynasty and the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period in China. Sun Quan pledged nominal allegiance to Cao Pi and became a vassal of Wei. In return, Cao Pi awarded Sun Quan the title \\"King of Wu\\" and granted him autonomous rule over the Jiangdong (or Wu) territories. A year later, Liu Bei declared himself emperor and established the state of Shu Han (or Shu) to contest Cao Pi's legitimacy. Battle of Xiaoting In 221, when Liu Bei started the Battle of Xiaoting against Sun Quan to retake his lost territories in southern Jing Province, Sun Quan sent Zhuge Jin as his representative to meet Liu Bei and begin peace talks.(ÂäâÂÇôÊù±‰ºêÂê≥ÔºåÂê≥ÁéãÊ±ÇÂíåÔºå ...) Sanguozhi vol. 52. Zhuge Jin told Liu Bei: In his annotations to Zhuge Jin's biography in the Sanguozhi, the fifth-century historian Pei Songzhi rebutted Zhuge Jin's speech to Liu Bei. From Pei Songzhi's point of view, Liu Bei had good reason(s) to go to war with Sun Quan because Sun Quan thwarted his attempts to revive the Eastern Han dynasty when he broke the Sun‚ÄìLiu alliance and seized Jing Province. Pei Songzhi also noted that Liu Bei's relationship with Guan Yu was so close that it could not be described in words. He remarked that if Liu Bei and Guan Yu's relationship were to be described in words in the Sanguozhi, it would take up so much space that it becomes a waste of space.(Ëá£Êùæ‰πã‰∫ëÔºö‰ª•ÁÇ∫ÂäâÂêé‰ª•Â∫∏ËúÄÁÇ∫ÈóúÊ≤≥ÔºåËçäÊ•öÁÇ∫Á∂≠Áø∞ÔºåÈóúÁæΩÊèöÂÖµÊ≤î„ÄÅÊº¢ÔºåÂøóÈôµ‰∏äÂúãÔºåÈõñÂå°‰∏ªÂÆöÈú∏ÔºåÂäüÊú™ÂèØÂøÖÔºåË¶ÅÁÇ∫Â®ÅËÅ≤ÈÅ†ÈúáÔºåÊúâÂÖ∂Á∂ìÁï•„ÄÇÂ≠´Ê¨äÊΩõÂåÖÁ¶çÂøÉÔºåÂä©È≠èÈô§ÂÆ≥ÔºåÊòØÁÇ∫Áø¶ÂÆóÂ≠êÂã§Áéã‰πãÂ∏´ÔºåË°åÊõπÂÖ¨ÁßªÈÉΩ‰πãË®àÔºåÊãØÊº¢‰πãË¶èÔºåÊñºËå≤ËÄåÊ≠¢„ÄÇÁæ©ÊóóÊâÄÊåáÔºåÂÆúÂÖ∂Âú®Â≠´Ê∞èÁü£„ÄÇÁëæ‰ª•Â§ßÁæ©Ë≤¨ÂÇôÔºåËçÖ‰πã‰ΩïÊÇ£ÁÑ°Ëæ≠Ôºõ‰∏îÂÇô„ÄÅÁæΩÁõ∏ËàáÔºåÊúâËã•ÂõõÈ´îÔºåËÇ°ËÇ±Ê©´ËôßÔºåÊÜ§ÁóõÂ∑≤Ê∑±ÔºåË±àÊ≠§Â•¢Èóä‰πãÊõ∏ÊâÄËÉΩËø¥ÈßêÂìâÔºÅËºâ‰πãÊñºÁØáÔºåÂØîÁÇ∫Ëæ≠Á´†‰πãË≤ª„ÄÇ) Pei Songzhi's annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 52. The Battle of Xiaoting ended in late 222 with victory for Sun Quan's forces, which were led by Sun Quan's general Lu Xun. Liu Bei retreated to Baidicheng (in present-day Fengjie County, Chongqing) after his disastrous defeat and died of illness in early 223. Battles against Wei In late 222, Sun Quan, who was previously a vassal king under the Cao Wei state, broke ties with the Wei emperor Cao Pi and declared himself the independent ruler of his Eastern Wu state. He promoted Zhuge Jin to General of the Left (), granted him acting imperial authority, and ordered him to station at Gong'an County to oversee the Wu defences in southern Jing Province. He also enfeoffed Zhuge Jin as the Marquis of Wanling ().(ÈªÉÊ≠¶ÂÖÉÂπ¥ÔºåÈÅ∑Â∑¶Â∞áËªçÔºåÁù£ÂÖ¨ÂÆâÔºåÂÅáÁØÄÔºåÂ∞ÅÂÆõÈôµ‰æØ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 52. Battle of Jiangling (223) Between 222 and 223, the Wei generals Cao Zhen and Xiahou Shang led their troops to attack the Wu-controlled Jiangling County (Ê±üÈôµÁ∏£; in present-day Jingzhou, Hubei), which was defended by the Wu general Zhu Ran. At the same time, another detachment of Wei troops occupied Zhongzhou (), an island in the Yangtze River near Jiangling County. When Zhuge Jin heard about it, he led Wu forces from Gong'an County to reinforce Zhu Ran. However, he turned out to be an incompetent military commander as he showed weak leadership, adopted a slow and reactive approach, and spent too much time on discussion and planning as opposed to actively seizing opportunities to attack the enemy. Due to his incompetence, the siege dragged on, and Sun Quan became rather unhappy with him. The siege on Jiangling County was eventually lifted after the Wu general Pan Zhang came up with a plan to burn down the Wei forces' pontoon bridges and drive them back. Although Zhuge Jin did not make any significant achievements in the battle, he received credit for contributing to the Wu forces' overall success in defending Jiangling County.(Âê≥ÈåÑÊõ∞ÔºöÊõπÁúü„ÄÅÂ§è‰æØÂ∞öÁ≠âÂúçÊú±ÁÑ∂ÊñºÊ±üÈôµÔºåÂèàÂàÜÊìö‰∏≠Â∑ûÔºåÁëæ‰ª•Â§ßÂÖµÁÇ∫‰πãÊïëÊè¥„ÄÇÁëæÊÄßÂºòÁ∑©ÔºåÊé®ÈÅìÁêÜÔºå‰ªªË®àÁï´ÔºåÁÑ°ÊáâÂçíÂÄö‰ºè‰πãË°ìÔºåÂÖµ‰πÜ‰∏çËß£ÔºåÊ¨ä‰ª•Ê≠§Êúõ‰πã„ÄÇÂèäÊò•Ê∞¥ÁîüÔºåÊΩòÁíãÁ≠â‰ΩúÊ∞¥ÂüéÊñº‰∏äÊµÅÔºåÁëæÈÄ≤ÊîªÊµÆÊ©ãÔºåÁúüÁ≠âÈÄÄËµ∞„ÄÇÈõñÁÑ°Â§ßÂã≥Ôºå‰∫¶‰ª•ÂÖ®Â∏´‰øùÂ¢ÉÁÇ∫Âäü„ÄÇ) Wu Lu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 52.

At the same time, he ordered Zhuge Jin and Zhang Ba () to lead a separate Wu army to attack the Wei-controlled city of Xiangyang. However, Zhuge Jin lost the battle against Wei forces led by Sima Yi. Zhang Ba was killed in battle and the Wu army lost over 1,000 men.

Battle of Xiangyang (234) Between mid June and early September 234, Sun Quan personally led a 100,000 strong Wu army to attack the Wei fortress of Xincheng at Hefei. At the same time, he ordered Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin to lead another 10,000 troops to attack Xiangyang, and Sun Shao and Zhang Cheng to lead their troops to attack Huaiyin County () in Guangling Commandery (around present-day Huai'an, Jiangsu). The Wei general Man Chong, who oversaw Xincheng's defences, successfully repelled the Wu invaders and killed Sun Quan's nephew Sun Tai in battle. Sun Quan eventually ordered a retreat when a plague broke out in his army and after he heard that the Wei emperor Cao Rui was personally leading reinforcements to Hefei. Sun Shao and Zhang Cheng also pulled back from Guangling Commandery after learning of Sun Quan's retreat from Hefei. In the meantime, Lu Xun ordered a close aide, Han Bian (), to deliver a report to Sun Quan. On the journey back, Han Bian was captured by a Wei patrol. When Zhuge Jin learnt of Han Bian's capture, he became fearful so he wrote to Lu Xun and urged him to make a hasty retreat from Xiangyang. Lu Xun did not respond, and he instructed his men to plant turnips and peas while he played weiqi and other games with his officers as though nothing had happened. Zhuge Jin believed that Lu Xun knew what he was doing so he did not panic. He came to see Lu Xun, who told him: \\"The enemy knows that His Majesty (Sun Quan) has withdrawn his forces, so they have no worries and will concentrate their attacks on us.

Lu Xun then secretly conveyed his plan to Zhuge Jin and ordered him to supervise the fleet of vessels on which they would sail back to Wu, while he gathered his troops and headed towards Xiangyang. The Wei forces had been wary of Lu Xun all this while so they immediately retreated back into the city when they saw Lu Xun's army approaching. Lu Xun organised his men in an orderly manner and instructed them to pretend to prepare for an attack on Xiangyang. By then, Zhuge Jin and the fleet had shown up, so Lu Xun and his forces progressively retreated to the vessels and left. The Wei forces in Xiangyang did not dare to make any move.(‰πÉÂØÜËàáÁëæÁ´ãË®àÔºå‰ª§ÁëæÁù£ËàüËàπÔºåÈÅúÊÇâ‰∏äÂÖµÈ¶¨Ôºå‰ª•ÂêëË•ÑÈôΩÂüé„ÄÇÊïµÁ¥†ÊÜöÈÅúÔºåÈÅΩÈÇÑËµ¥Âüé„ÄÇÁëæ‰æøÂºïËàπÂá∫ÔºåÈÅúÂæêÊï¥ÈÉ®‰ºçÔºåÂºµÊãìËÅ≤Âã¢ÔºåÊ≠•Ë∂®ËàπÔºåÊïµ‰∏çÊï¢Âπ≤„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 58.

After the L√º Yi scandal ended in 238, Sun Quan sent a personal representative to meet all his senior generals and apologise to them, as well as to seek their views on how he could reform the bureaucracy to prevent corrupt officials like L√º Yi from abusing their powers again. However, to his disappointment, Zhuge Jin and other generals such as Bu Zhi, Zhu Ran and L√º Dai gave the excuse that they were not in charge of civil affairs and said that civil affairs were best left to civil officials such as Lu Xun and Pan Jun. Sun Quan then wrote an emotional letter to them, blaming himself for the mistakes and urging them to give him honest advice and point out his mistakes.(Â£πÊó£‰ºèË™ÖÔºåÂê≥‰∏ª‰Ωø‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈÉéË¢ÅÁ¶ÆÂëäË¨ùË´∏Â§ßÂ∞áÔºåÂõ†ÂïèÊôÇ‰∫ãÊâÄÁï∂ÊêçÁõä„ÄÇÁ¶ÆÈÇÑÔºåÂæ©ÊúâË©îË≤¨Ë´∏ËëõÁëæ„ÄÅÊ≠•È®≠„ÄÅÊú±ÁÑ∂„ÄÅÂëÇÂ≤±Á≠âÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåË¢ÅÁ¶ÆÈÇÑ‰∫ëÔºö ...

Previously, Le Parcq was in the arrondissement of Arras.INSEE, Modifications territoriales At the French canton reorganisation which came into effect in March 2015, the canton of Le Parcq was disbanded and its communes became part of the canton of Auxi-le-Ch√¢teau.D√©cret n¬∞ 2014-233 du 24 f√©vrier 2014 portant d√©limitation des cantons dans le d√©partement du Pas-de- Calais PopulationHistory The establishment of Le Parcq dates from the founding of a castle (on the current site of Vieil-Hesdin) by Baldwin I of Constantinople or Baudouin IX, Count of Flanders in about 1208. It was a wooden enclosure surrounded by walls within which wild animals were placed in large numbers. In 1329, portcullises were installed at all the gates of the castle. Unfortunately, in 1335, Edward III destroyed the castle just before the start of the Hundred Years War. This destruction was continued in 1337 by Charles III of Navarre who brought down the walls. In 1395, Philip II of Burgundy restored the castle walls. Several people were employed daily to feed the animals in the park which also had a vast falconry centre and two fishing lakes. The park totalled 940 hectares with a perimeter of approximately 8 miles (13 km), opening onto the outside world by many gates. After the destruction of Vieil-Hesdin in) 1553 by Charles V, the park was, at the initiative of Philippe V of France, made the parkland available to those displaced by the fall of the old town, who wished to build new homes on the parkland. To attract more people, tax benefits were given, on February 25, 1586 to all those moving into the area. Thus, the park became a village, originally known as Parc-l√®s-Hesdin.

He was perhaps the most important figure there between Andrea Palladio, whose unfinished projects he inherited at Palladio's death in 1580, and Baldassarre Longhena, Scamozzi's only pupil. The great public project of Palladio's that Scamozzi inherited early in the process of construction was the Teatro Olimpico at Vicenza, which Palladio had designed in the last months of his life. Biography Monument to Vincenzo Scamozzi. Church of San Lorenzo, Vicenza. Scamozzi was born in Vicenza. His father was the surveyor and building contractor Gian Domenico Scamozzi; he was Scamozzi's first teacher, imbuing him with the principles of Sebastiano Serlio, laid out in Serlio's book. Vincenzo visited Rome in 1579‚Äì1580, and then moved to Venice in 1581. In 1600, he visited France and left a sketchbook record of his impressions of French architecture, which first saw the light of day in 1959.Franco Barbieri, ed. Taccuino di Viaggio da Parigi a Venezia (14 marzo‚Äì11 maggio 1600) (Venice/Rome:Istituto per la Collaborazione Culturale), 1959. Scamozzi is famous for having inherited several unfinished projects from Andrea Palladio at the time of Palladio's death in 1580 and for bringing them to their completed form. The Idea of a Universal Architecture L'idea della Architettura universale di Vincenzo Scamozzi architetto veneto, 1615. Scamozzi's influence spread far beyond his Italian commissions through his two-volume treatise, L'idea dell'architettura universale (\\"The Idea of a Universal Architecture\\"), which is one of the last works of the Renaissance dealing with the theory of architecture.Vincenzo Scamozzi. The Idea of a Universal Architecture. English translation published in Amsterdam (2003). It was originally published with woodcut illustrations at Venice in 1615. Scamozzi depended for sections of his treatment of Vitruvius on Daniele Barbaro's commentary, published in 1556 with illustrations by Palladio;Inigo Jones' library included Palladio, Scamozzi and Barbaro on Vitruvius. he also discussed issues of building practice. At that time, such treatises were becoming a vehicle for self-promotion. Scamozzi was aware of the potential value of publicity distributed through the established channels of the book trade and he included many of his own plans and elevations, as built, as they should have been built, and as idealized projects. His first book entitled Discorsi sopra l'antichita di Roma (Venice: Ziletti, 1583) had been quickly cobbled together with some illustrated commentary on the ruins of Rome, assembled in \\"the space of a few of days.\\" According to his preface to the volumes, the images were stock productions that already existed. Over half were copied from a volume published by Hieronymus Cock in Antwerp in 1551.Praecipua aliquot Romanae Antiquitatis Ruinarum Monimenta, British Museum, UK. His major book came out one year before his death and was too late to influence his own success. Scamozzi's practice is sometimes spoken of as being a source of the neo-Palladian architecture as it was introduced by Inigo Jones, another follower of Andrea Palladio's own example. Rudolf Wittkower referred to him as among \\"the intellectual father(s) of neo-classicism\\". Piazza San Marco Scamozzi moved to Venice in 1581, where he had been invited to design the Procuratie Nuove on the Piazza San Marco itself. The Procuratie Nuove were a row of official housing for the Procuratorate of San Marco, presented as a unified palace front that continues the end facade of the Sansovino Library, with its arcaded ground floor and arch-headed windows of the first floor, but adding an upper floor to provide the necessary accommodation. In accomplishing this design, Scamozzi adapted a rejected project of Palladio's for a re-faced Doge's Palace, with colonnettes that flank the windows to support alternating triangular and arched pediments, upon which Scamozzi added reclining figures, to balance the richness of the Sansovinian decoration of the two lower floors. Eleven bays of this project were completed, and later were extended by Baldassare Longhena (Scamozzi's only pupil) to fill the whole south flank of the piazza.

Geography Le Portel is a tourist, fishing and light industrial town situated about southwest of Boulogne town centre, at the junction of the D236 and D119 roads. It has a beach and the white cliffs of the English coast can be seen across the sea on clear days. History Le Portel translates as \\"the little port.\\" The original Le Portel was a hamlet east of the town of Outreau. It became an independent municipality on June 13, 1856 by an imperial decree of Napoleon III. In the 19th century, flint tools were discovered in the centre of the village, by the river near the Hamel Bridge, evidence of the long occupation of the site. A Gallo-Roman cemetery has been excavated in the hamlet of Ch√¢tillon. Of agricultural origin, it grew rapidly during the 19th century because of fishing, along with the nearby port of Boulogne-sur-Mer. Sailors of Portel were as numerous as those of Boulogne before World War I. In 1841, two Le Portel sailors were on the ship Belle Poule, that brought back the remains of Napoleon. During the Second World War, on 8 and 9 September 1943, Le Portel suffered as part of Operation Cockade, a diversionary manoeuvre by the Allies to fool the Germans into believing the possibility of a landing on the English Channel. The bombings, which destroyed 93% of the village, also killed 376 civilians. On 12 August 1944, Charles de Gaulle was at Le Portel for its liberation. The town received the Croix de guerre with silver star for its sacrifice.

The population of the town itself is 5,368, the population of the canton is 14,939. History The county of Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise, usually referred to as just Saint-Pol, was originally a stronghold of the Counts of Flanders and was established as a county in the late 9th century. When the county passed out of the family of the Flemish counts, it remained subject to the Count of Flanders as his vassals until 1180. It became subject to France, then Artois (1237‚Äì1329), then France again until it ceased to exist as a county and was annexed to France in 1702. Saint-Pol was first controlled by the Flemish counts, then by the family known as Campdavaine from early in the 11th century. In 1205 the county passed to the seigneurs of Ch√¢tillon through marriage, and remained with this dynasty until 1360 when it passed to the Luxembourg dynasty. Around 1487 the county passed to the Capetian-Bourbon- Vend√¥me dynasty through marriage, then to the Longueville-Neuch√¢tel dynasty from around 1563. In 1702 it came under direct rule of France. In the Middle Ages, several of the Counts of Saint-Pol were active in the Crusades. On 7 November 1920, the remains of four unidentifiable, fallen British soldiers disintered from the battlefields at Aisne, Arras, the Somme and Ypres were brought to the town's chapel. There, Brigadier-General Louis John Wyatt of the North Staffordshire Regiment, aided by Lieutenant-Colonel EAS Gell, selected one to be carried to Westminster Abbey to be re-buried in the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior. The remaining three bodies were removed and reburied in the military cemetery St. Pol British Cemetery on rue de Canteraine, CWGC at Wyatt's headquarters at St Pol.North Staffs Regiment Officer selects the Unknown Warrior, Pursehouse, Richard and Crozier, Danielle, in Bulletin Number 112, a journal of the Western Front Association, December 2018, p.23 Notable people Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise was the birthplace of Marie de St Pol (c1303-1377), foundress of Pembroke College, Cambridge.

This usually accompanies a change in what is considered deviant. While typically preserving the rule \\"do not harm others\\" (harm principle), a permissive society would have few other moral, religious or legal codes (no victimless crimes, for example). Characteristics Permissive society can be seen as a supplement for a free society. The free society is based on political and philosophical liberalism of the nineteenth century, while the permissive society extends the freedom beyond political and intellectual ones and includes social and moral freedom. Aspects that have changed recently in modern permissive societies: * Sexual freedom has increased. This includes the freedom to take part in sexual activities which were previously considered unacceptable or even criminalized, such as BDSM, fetishes and homosexuality. Freedom to view violent and sexual material including movies, music, art and literature has increased, and censorship of these and other arts has decreased. * The power of religious groups subsides, often accompanied by a rising secularism. History The most cited example is the social revolution and sexual revolution of the late 1960s in Europe and America, giving rise to more liberal attitudes toward artistic freedom, homosexuality and drugs, which had its origins in blowback against repressive authoritarian regimes such as the Nazis, as described by the Bloomsbury Group. Also commonly mentioned is the general loosening of Britain's former adherence to Victorian values. The term permissive society was originally used as a hostile label by those who believed that sexual promiscuity was too high., though that may be due to a blanket ban of proper sexual education-- where abstinence-only rigours are the only 'proper' method of instruction-- in earlier generations, which is a known factor in rates of unprotected sexual activity. During the 1970s and 1980s, some British sociologists took a more sceptical approach to the question of the sixties 'permissive society', noting that it actually resulted in only partial and amended regulation of previously illegal and or stigmatised social activities. For example, the Sexual Offences Act 1967 decriminalised homosexuality but at an unequal age of consent, 21 (although it was subsequently reduced 18 (1994) and, finally, 16 (2002), additionally, the 1967 act decriminalised homosexuality only under limited circumstances. Similarly, the Abortion Act 1967 did not allow to abortion on request but required obtaining medical permission, with time limits. Furthermore, as with the case of cannabis decriminalisation, some instances of liberalised social attitudes were not met with legislative change. It is therefore important to note that the extent of 'permissiveness' that occurred in the 1960s may have been overstated.National Deviancy Conference (ed) Permissiveness and Control: The Fate of the Sixties Legislation: London: Macmilan: 1980Tim Newburn: Permission and Regulation: Morals in Postwar Britain: London: Routledge: 1992 Some would argue that in the case of LGBT rights in the United Kingdom, Western Europe, Canada and New Zealand, the initial changes were only a prelude to further periods of legislative change: same sex marriage or civil unions and gay adoption have all occurred since the initial decriminalisation of homosexuality. As well as this, there have been further periods of social reformist legislation that have not similarly been described as evidence of a permissive society. These include the passage of legislation that decriminalised prostitution in Australia and prostitution in New Zealand, as well as the decriminalisation of medical marijuana across many US states and partial legalization of recreational marijuana in Canada. The term appears to have been historicised. Criticism Though liberals view permissiveness as a positive, social conservatives claim that it weakens the moral and sociocultural structures necessary for a civilized and valid society. For example, lower divorce rates, decreasing the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases, and controlling crime are all desirable. Others answer that these issues themselves are outcomes of the very repressiveness that seeks to eliminate them. It is believed that citizens enjoying free thinking, speaking, and acting without coercion or recusancy, have contributed to a society where freethinkers thrive, that is, without having to fear repression through intolerance and injustice. Permissive society ultimately comes down to a question of if a given individual has enough capacity to make their own decisions, that is, intellectual independence; and also if the individual enjoys freedom of autonomy, that is, freedom of expression. If the individual does, then a permissive society is likely to exist. If they do not, then an alternative oppressive society instead, is the reality.

He was the founding Rector of Gomel State Medical Institute in Belarus in 1991, specially dedicated to scientific work on the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. Since 2013, Professor Bandazhevsky has been leading Chernobyl Ecology and Health https://chernobyl-health.org/ in Ukraine, supported by European Commission. In the aftermath of Chernobyl accident and also 2020 April wildfire near Chernobyl, Bandazhevsky has been calling for international help.  Background  In 1978, Bandazhevsky married Galina Bandazhevskaja, a medical doctor specialized in pediatrics. He studied at the Medical Institute of Grodno and became a specialist of anatomic pathology. He supported his doctoral thesis in 1987, and at the age of 31, he became the youngest professor in the USSR, a year after the Chernobyl disaster. He then named as the director of the Central Laboratory of Scientific Research. In 1990, he became the founding Rector (President) of the Gomel State Medical Institute.Interview du Professeur Yuri Bandazhevsky, at Minsk, April 2000 After 9 years of research including human body autopsy and animal experiments with cesium included feed, Professor Bandazhevsky made an official conclusion about the actual radiation effects on human body, especially concentrating on cesium accumulated in heart, kidney, liver, thyroid as well as genetic effects on fetus. In 1999, he was arrested on suspicion of terrorism, later convicted for allegedly receiving a bribe, and was released in 2005 and went to France. He became the 25th person to receive a Freedom Passport, approved by the European Parliament, and a honorary citizen of 17 French cities, including Paris. Since 2013, he has been leading an international research center \\"Ecology and Health (https://chernobyl-health.org/)\\", established in Kiev, conducting research on radiation effects on people especially on children in contaminated areas of Ukraine.  Imprisonment and Research Afterwards  On June 2001, Yury Bandazhevsky was sentenced to eight years imprisonment on the grounds that he had received bribes from students' parents. The institute's Deputy Director, Vladimir Ravkov, also received an eight-year prison sentence. Bandazhevsky's lawyer claimed that he had been convicted on the basis of two testimonies made under duress, without any material evidence. According to many human rights groups Dr. Bandazhevsky was a prisoner of conscience. Amnesty International has stated on their website, \\"His conviction was widely believed to be related to his scientific research into the Chernobyl catastrophe and his open criticism of the official response to the Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster on people living in the region of Gomel.\\" His arrest came soon after he published reports critical of the official research being conducted into the Chernobyl incident, and was issued by presidential decree N21 ¬ëOn Urgent Measures for the Combat of Terrorism. () Yury Bandazhevsky was released on parole from prison on August 5, 2005, and prohibited for five months from leaving Belarus. He was afterward invited by the mayor of Clermont-Ferrand, in France, to work at the university and at the hospital on Chernobyl's consequences. Clermont-Ferrand has been since 1977 linked to Gomel where Bandazhevsky used to work. In France, he is notably supported by the Commission de recherche et d'information ind√©pendantes sur la radioactivit√© (CRIIRAD). Since 2013, Bandazhevsky has been leading the research and health protection project, \\"Chernobyl: Ecology and Health\\" near Chernobyl in Ivankiv District in Ukraine, supported by European Commission.

It is primarily the power of expressing strong emotions in striking and appropriate language, thereby producing conviction or persuasion. The term is also used for writing in a fluent style. The concept of eloquence dates to the ancient Greeks, Calliope (one of the nine daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne) being the Muse of epic poetry and eloquence. The Greek god Hermes was patron of eloquence. Cicero is considered as one of the most eloquent orators of Antiquity. Fr. Louis Bourdaloue is regarded as one of the founders of French eloquence. \\"The Effects of Trim's Eloquence\\". George Cruikshank's illustration to Laurence Sterne's The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman Eloquence derives from the Latin roots: ƒì (a shortened form of the preposition ex), meaning \\"out (of)\\", and loqui, a deponent verb meaning \\"to speak\\". Thus, being eloquent is having the ability to project words fluidly out of the mouth and the ability to understand and command the language in such a way that one employs a graceful style coupled with the power of persuasion, or just being extremely graceful in the interpretation of communication. Petrarch (Fracesco Petrarca), in his study program of the classics and antiquity (Italian Renaissance) focused attention on language and communication. After mastering language, the goal was to reach a \\"level of eloquence\\", to be able to present gracefully, combine thought and reason in a powerful way, so as to persuade others to a point of view. Petrarch encouraged students to imitate the ancient writers, from a language perspective, combining clear and correct speech with moral thought. The Renaissance humanists focused on the correlation of speech and political principles as a powerful tool to present and persuade others to particular concepts. At the core of presentations was the use of graceful style, clear concise grammar and usage, and over time the insertion of rational and emotional arguments. In modern times, colloquial speech entered into presentation styles deemed eloquent. Eloquence is both a natural talent and improved by knowledge of language, study of a specific subject to be addressed, philosophy, rationale and ability to form a persuasive set of tenets within a presentation. \\"True eloquence,\\" Oliver Goldsmith says, \\"Does not consist ... in saying great things in a sublime style, but in a simple style; for there is, properly speaking, no such thing as a sublime style, the sublimity lies only in the things; and when they are not so, the language may be turgid, affected, metaphorical, but not affecting.\\" Eloquent politicians Politicians are often people with better eloquent skills than others. Marcus Antonius, c. 83‚Äì30 BCE, Roman politician and soldier gave one of the most memorable speeches in history, dramatized by William Shakespeare in the play Julius Caesar; Shakespeare used Antonius's famous opening line \\"Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears\\". Many famous political leaders, like Winston Churchill and Martin Luther King Jr., dictators such as Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, rose to prominence in large part due to their eloquence. In the Iranian Revolution, Ruhollah Khomeini came to power in part through the eloquence of his speeches, smuggled into the country on audio cassettes while he was still in exile .

History Sun-Times Media Group was founded in 1986 under the name American Publishing Company, as a holding company for Hollinger Inc.'s American properties. It focused on newspapers, mostly in smaller markets. In February 1994, it acquired the Chicago Sun-Times, holding an Initial Public Offering (IPO) to fund the acquisition. At the time, it was the fifteenth-largest U.S. newspaper group. It changed its name to Hollinger International in 1994. Hollinger's non-American properties, which included The Daily Telegraph and The Jerusalem Post were added to the company in 1996, and its Canadian papers in 1997. It created the National Post from the Financial Post in 1998. That year, it began a process of shrinking the company, selling many of its small papers to the private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners, who formed Liberty Group Publishing. In 2000, it sold most of the rest to four media companies (Bradford Publications Company, Community Newspaper Holdings, Paxton Media Group, and Forum Communications). Its Canadian holdings, notably the National Post, several smaller papers, and a majority stake in the Southam newspaper chain, were sold to CanWest in 2000 in connection with Conrad Black renouncing his Canadian citizenship to gain a British peerage. That year, Hollinger International bought the Chicago-area publications of Copley Press (The Herald News, The Beacon-News, The Courier-News, and Lake County News-Sun, along with several smaller papers). Conrad Black was fired by the Hollinger International board in 2004 for fraud. He attempted to sell his stake to the Barclay brothers in January 2004 and the brothers launched a takeover bid for the rest of Hollinger International. However the sale was blocked by a judge in the United States after the company's board lodged a court action against the sale. The Barclay brothers later bought The Telegraph Group which included The Daily Telegraph, The Sunday Telegraph, and The Spectator. On November 16, 2004, the sale of The Jerusalem Post to Mirkaei Tikshoret, a Tel Aviv-based publisher of Israeli newspapers, was announced. CanWest Global Communications, Canada's biggest media concern, announced it has agreed to take a 50 percent stake in The Jerusalem Post after Mirkaei buys the property. In February 2006, Hollinger sold substantially all of its Canadian assets. The corporation's name was changed to Sun-Times Media Group on July 17, 2006. On March 31, 2009, the company filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Code. In September 2009, Chicago financier James C. Tyree and a team of investors had a $5 million bid accepted to purchase the Sun-Times Media Group, contingent on the paper's unions accepting deep compensation cuts and work- rule changes. The purchase was completed the next month. Tyree died suddenly in March 2011. Jeremy Halbreich, chief executive, said that Tyree will be greatly missed and that his death will make no changes in the media company's strategy. Since the Tyree-Halbreich takeover, the organization has shown accelerating declines in circulation, advertising revenue and quality of editorial content. Industry analysts have repeatedly pointed to the group's failure to craft a competitive online product as evidence of continued decline. On December 6, 2011, the company announced it will institute a paywall to access its online content from December 8, 2011. On December 26, 2011, Chicago investment group Wrapports, L.L.C., led by Chairman Michael W. Ferro Jr. & CEO Timothy Knight, completed its purchase of the company.

At one time, the company was the third-largest media empire in the world. The company went bankrupt in 2007.  History  Hollinger Inc. was used by Conrad Black as a holding company for his media interests after he acquired control of The Daily Telegraph in 1986. The company took its name from Hollinger Gold Mines, which started in 1909 and later became Hollinger Mines, owner of one of the world's largest gold mines near Timmins, Ontario. It was acquired by E.P. Taylor's conglomerate, Argus Corporation. Black took control of Argus in 1978, and he sold off its assets by 1985. Hollinger Inc. was controlled by Canadian-based Ravelston Corporation, which was used as a personal holding company by Black. Ravelston was placed in receivership in the summer of 2005.  Holdings  Hollinger Inc. was the parent company of Chicago-based Hollinger International, whose primary holdings included a group of Chicago newspapers. Its flagship paper was the Chicago Sun-Times. Hollinger also owned The Jerusalem Post and interests in Australian and Canadian newspaper chains. Hollinger's non- Canadian papers were sold to Hollinger International in 1996. In 2000, Hollinger sold its Canadian newspaper, magazine and internet assets to Canwest Global for $3.5 billion. Hollinger became a holding company for stakes in various companies, including its controlling stake in Hollinger International. The ownership structure of Hollinger and other related companies was described as \\"complex\\" and \\"convoluted.\\"  Demise  A series of non-competition payments and management fees made between 1999 and 2003 to Black and his associates would later lead to lengthy court and regulatory proceedings. In 2003 and 2004, Black was removed as owner from Hollinger, and other corporate positions, after there were claims made that he had looted his companies for personal profit. Shareholders learned that the company was facing serious financial problems. Shortly afterward, a number of court and regulatory orders left the company with no income or operating business. On August 2, 2007, Hollinger filed for bankruptcy protection in Canada and the United States. At the time, the company was 78% owned by Black's company Ravelston. Hollinger continued to assert control over Sun-Media Times Group Inc. Hollinger shares were delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange in August 2008.

It is located west of Aire-sur-la-Lys and south of Saint-Omer, on the D 157 and D 341 road junction. Located on the river Lys. PopulationHistory At the time of the Gauls, Tarwanna or Tervanna was the capital of the Belgian tribe of the Morini. After the Romans conquered Gaul, they too made the city the capital of the Civitas Morinorum district. The origin of the name has several theories. According to the historian Malbracq, it got its name from its founder \\"Lucius Tauruannus\\", others say it is derived from \\"Terra avanae\\" The land of Oats. But this second derivation seems to be a generic used term. In the 7th century, probably around 639, Saint Audomar (Saint Omer) established the bishopric of Terwaan or Terenburg, the diocese of Th√©rouanne, which during the Middle Ages controlled a large part of the left bank of the river Scheldt. Territorially it was part of the county of Artois which belonged to the county of Flanders. In 1303 the town was burnt by Flemish forces during the Franco- Flemish War. Thanks to that ecclesiastical control of some of the most prosperous cities north of the Alps, like Arras and Ypres, the bishopric was able to build a cathedral which was at the time the largest in France. The town was captured by the Emperor Maximilian and Henry VIII from the French in 1513 after the battle of the Spurs. In 1553 Charles V besieged Th√©rouanne, then a French enclave in the Holy Roman Empire, in revenge for a defeat by the French at the siege of Metz. After he captured the city he ordered it to be razed, the roads to be broken up, and the area to be ploughed and salted.salting is mentioned in Elise Whitlock Rose, Cathedrals and Cloisters of Northern France, p. 8, but this is not a reliable historical source. Only a small commune which lay outside the city walls, then named Saint-Martin- Outre-Eaux, was left standing, and later (probably around 1800) took over the name Th√©rouanne. Part of the portal of the cathedral was acquired by Saint- Omer; a colossal statue of Christ is all that is left of it these days. The disappearance of the former bishopric led to a reform of sees at the Council of Trent, and the bishopric of Th√©rouanne was split between those of Saint- Omer and Ypres.

It was released in the United States as The Seduction of Mimi, although a literal translation of the title would be \\"Mimi the metalworker, wounded in honor\\". The film was entered into the 1972 Cannes Film Festival. The screenplay was very loosely adapted for the 1977 film Which Way Is Up? starring Richard Pryor. Plot Set in both Sicily and mainland Italy, the film follows the adventures of a man nicknamed Mimi (Giancarlo Giannini). Mimi is a poor laborer who is pressured by his employers to vote for the mafia candidate in a local election. Frustrated by the system and assured that the ballot will be secret Mimi votes for the communist representative instead. However he is fired and assured he will never work again as the ballot was not secret. Disgusted Mimi flees to Turin, while his wife, Rosalia, stays in Sicily. In Turin Mimi finds illegal construction work. When he witnesses one of the labourers falling to his death he helps the man into a van thinking that he is being taken to the hospital. When he discovers that his mafia bosses plan on dumping the body, Mimi tells him that his wife is the goddaughter of Liggio, a powerful mafioso. As a result, he is given a good union job at a factory. He also becomes further embroiled with the communist party. One day, Mimi sees the beautiful Fiore on the street, selling sweaters. When she and her friend are attacked he helps them and learns that she is a Trotskyist. When they walk in the park he sexually assaults and tries to rape her, but Fiore fends Mimi off and says that she is a virgin, and will not make love with a man until she falls in love. Mimi continues to see her until finally, heartbroken he tells her that he loves her, but cannot bear to be around her as he feels she will never return his love. Fiore finally tells Mimi she loves him. Aware that Mimi is married, Fiore nevertheless takes him as a lover, and finally becomes pregnant, giving birth to a son, Mimi. At the christening for their child Mimi goes to get more champagne and happens upon a murder perpetrated by the mob. Though he is supposed to be shot Mimi nevertheless ends up with only a scratch and, when the police question him, refuses to divulge any answers. As a result, he is promoted at work to a management job in Sicily. Terrified that his wife will discover his second family, Mimi hides Fiore and their child, and pretends to always be too tired for sex. That causes the townspeople to gossip, and begin to believe that Mimi is a homosexual. He is finally taken out by a few of his friends who tell him that Rosalia is pregnant with the child of another man, Amilcare. Mimi is outraged, and, after attacking Rosalia, tells her about Fiore and his son. Rosalia then decides to keep her child and refuses to divorce Mimi, gloating that her bastard child will bear his last name, while his son with Fiore will have a different name. To avenge his honour, Mimi attempts to rape and then seduces Amalia, the wife of Amilcare. After sleeping with her he informs her that Amilcare had impregnated his wife, Rosalia. Initially horrified, Amalia decides that the best way for the two of them to get back at their cheating spouses is to conceive a child together, leading to monthly visits between the two. When Amalia is several months pregnant, Mimi confronts her husband on the town steps, telling everyone there that Amalia is bearing Mimi's child. Enraged, Amilcare threatens to shoot Mimi, but Mimi is unconcerned; having considered the possibility, he warned Amalia to empty Amilcare's pistol. However, a man from the mafia, assigned to watch over Mimi, sees Amilcare reach for the pistol and shoots him, then shoves the smoking gun in Mimi's hand; Mimi is then jailed for Amilcare's murder. While in jail, Mimi is visited by a mafia man who informs him that, for taking the blame for the Amilcare murder, he is now a respected man and will be assured a job when he is released from jail. Mimi refuses; however, when released, Mimi is excited to see Fiore and little Mimi awaiting him. He is soon overwhelmed by Amalia and their child, and Rosalia's bastard son, all of whom clamor for him, calling him \\"Papa\\". In desperate need of money, Mimi goes to work for the mafia, promoting the election of Vico Tricarico. Disgusted that Mimi has abandoned his communist ideals, Fiore leaves him, taking young Mimi with her. Mimi chases after her, then collapses on the ground mourning his lost ideals.

The citizens making the choices about their society make them from an \\"original position\\" of equality and ignorance (left), without knowing what gender, race, abilities, tastes, wealth, or position in society they will have (right). Rawls claims this ensures they will choose a just society. The \\"veil of ignorance\\" is a method of determining the morality of issues. It asks a decision-maker to make a choice about a social or moral issue and assumes that they have enough information to know the consequences of their possible decisions for everyone but would not know, or would not take into account, which person they are. The theory contends that not knowing one's ultimate position in society would lead to the creation of a just system, as the decision-maker would not want to make decisions which benefit a certain group at the expense of another, because the decision-maker could theoretically end up in either group. The idea has been present in moral philosophy at least since the eighteenth century. The veil of ignorance is part of a long tradition of thinking in terms of a social contract that includes the writings of Immanuel Kant, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Jean Jacques Rousseau, and Thomas Jefferson. Prominent modern names attached to it are John Harsanyi and John Rawls. Overview Spencer J. Maxcy outlines the concept as follows: > Imagine that you have set for yourself the task of developing a totally new > social contract for today's society. How could you do so fairly? Although > you could never actually eliminate all of your personal biases and > prejudices, you would need to take steps at least to minimize them. Rawls > suggests that you imagine yourself in an original position behind a veil of > ignorance. Behind this veil, you know nothing of yourself and your natural > abilities, or your position in society. You know nothing of your sex, race, > nationality, or individual tastes. Behind such a veil of ignorance all > individuals are simply specified as rational, free, and morally equal > beings. You do know that in the \\"real world\\", however, there will be a wide > variety in the natural distribution of natural assets and abilities, and > that there will be differences of sex, race, and culture that will > distinguish groups of people from each other. It has been argued that such a concept can have grand effects if it were to be practiced both in the present and in the past. Referring again to the example of slavery, if the slave-owners were forced through the veil of ignorance to imagine that they themselves may be slaves, then suddenly slavery may no longer seem justifiable. A grander example would be if each individual in society were to base their practices on the fact that they could be the least advantaged member of society. In this scenario, freedom and equality could possibly coexist in a way that has been the ideal of many philosophers. For example, in the imaginary society, one might or might not be intelligent, rich, or born into a preferred class. Since one may occupy any position in the society once the veil is lifted, the device forces the parties to consider society from the perspective of all members, including the worst-off and best- off members. Rawls' version The version proposed in 1971 by American philosopher John Rawls in his \\"original position\\" political philosophy is based upon the following thought experiment: people making political decisions imagine that they know nothing about the particular talents, abilities, tastes, social class, and positions they will have within a social order. When such parties are selecting the principles for distribution of rights, positions, and resources in the society in which they will live, this \\"veil of ignorance\\" prevents them from knowing who will receive a given distribution of rights, positions, and resources in that society. For example, for a proposed society in which 50% of the population is kept in slavery, it follows that on entering the new society there is a 50% likelihood that the participant would be a slave. The idea is that parties subject to the veil of ignorance will make choices based upon moral considerations, since they will not be able to act on their class interest. As Rawls put it, \\"no one knows his place in society, his class position or social status; nor does he know his fortune in the distribution of natural assets and abilities, his intelligence and strength, and the like\\". The idea of the thought experiment is to render obsolete those personal considerations that are morally irrelevant to the justice or injustice of principles meant to allocate the benefits of social cooperation. History The concept of the veil of ignorance has been in use by other names for centuries by philosophers such as John Stuart Mill and Immanuel Kant whose work discussed the concept of the social contract, Adam Smith with his \\"impartial spectator\\", or the ideal observer theory. John Harsanyi helped to formalize the concept in economics, and argued that it provides an argument in favor of utilitarianism rather than an argument for a social contract, as rational agents consider expected outcomes, not maximin outcomes or the worst-case outcomes. The usage of the term by John Rawls was developed in his 1971 book A Theory of Justice. Modern work tends to focus on the different decision theories that might describe the choice of the decision-maker \\"behind the veil\\". In addition, Michael Moehler has shown that, from a moral point of view, decision theory is not necessarily central to veil of ignorance arguments, but the precise moral ideals that are assumed to model the veil. From a moral point of view, there is not one veil of ignorance but many different versions of it.Moehler, Michael (2018), Minimal Morality: A Multilevel Social Contract Theory.

After starting his career as a lawyer and teacher, he became active in the Democratic Party during the party's Solid South period, and was a strong proponent of the white supremacy campaigns of that period. Aycock was one of the leading perpetrators of the Wilmington insurrection of 1898, in which whites took over the city government by force, the only coup d'√©tat in U. S. history. He became known as \\"the Education Governor\\" for his advocacy for the improvement of North Carolina's public school systems, and following his term in office, he traveled the country promoting educational causes. Early life Charles B. Aycock was born in Wayne County, North Carolina, as the youngest of the 10 children of Benjamin and Serena Aycock. His family lived near the present-day town of Fremont, North Carolina, then known as Nahunta. Though his father died when he was 15, his mother and older brothers recognized his abilities and determined that he should go to college. Aycock attended the University of North Carolina (today the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) and joined the Philanthropic Society, a debate and literary society at the university. After graduating in 1880 with first honors in both oratory and essay writing, he entered law practice in Goldsboro and supplemented his income by teaching school. His success in both fields led to his appointment as superintendent of schools for Wayne County and to service on the school board in Goldsboro. His political career began in 1888 as a presidential elector for Grover Cleveland, when he gained distinction as an orator and political debater. From 1893 to 1897, he served as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina. White supremacy campaigns In 1898 and 1900, Aycock was prominent in the Democratic Party's \\"white supremacy\\" campaigns. Aycock's involvement with the Wilmington insurrection of 1898 is chronicled in an official state commission report. \\"Planned violence to suppress the African American and Republican communities grew into unplanned bloodshed. The frenzy over white supremacy victory, incessantly repeated by orators such as Alfred Moore Waddell and Charles Aycock, simply could not be quieted after an overwhelming and somewhat anticlimactic election victory.\\" Aycock was reportedly not present in Wilmington the day of the insurrection. In 1899, the heavily Democrat state legislature of North Carolina passed a suffrage amendment to the state constitution. This amendment added a poll tax and literacy test, as well as a grandfather clause to avoid disenfranchising poor white voters. Aycock supported the amendment, and urged legislatures to submit it to a popular vote in an August election - moved up from November.Zucchino, pp. 304 In the same election, Aycock ran for governor against Republican Spencer B. Adams. On the campaign trail, his supporters displayed one of the rapid-fire guns from the Wilmington insurrection of 1898 and Aycock regularly appeared with Red Shirts. Zucchino, pp. 313 In the 1900 North Carolina gubernatorial election, the suffrage amendment was confirmed and Aycock was elected governor. He reportedly won 60% of the vote, but this was in part due to voter fraud. In several counties the number of votes for Aycock exceeded the number of eligible voters by several hundred.Zucchino, pp. 316 Governor As governor, Aycock became known as the \\"Education Governor\\" for his support of the public school system. It was said that one school was constructed in the state for every day he was in office. He was supposedly dedicated to education after watching his mother make her mark when signing a deed. He felt that no lasting social reform could be accomplished without education. He supported increased salaries for teachers, longer school terms, and new school buildings; \\"690 new schoolhouses erected, including 599 for whites and 91 for blacks.\\" While credited for an expansion of schools for black students, Aycock is also noted as having advocated that black students be properly educated through curriculum and care tightly controlled by North Carolina whites, to \\"benefit the black race to fit them into a subordinate role.\\" Historian Morgan Kousser has demonstrated that Aycock's progressive attitude toward black education was based on white Democrats' desire to ensure that the disfranchisement of black voters would not be reversed by federal government intervention. Kousser observed, \\"Some scholars have made a great deal of the opposition of 'progressive' Governor Charles B. Aycock and state school superintendent James Y. Joyner to the movement for a constitutional amendment in North Carolina to limit black school expenditures to the amount paid by Negroes in taxes. It is true that Aycock threatened resignation if such a law passed and that, speaking to the legislature in 1903, he condemned the proposed measure as 'unjust, unwise and unconstitutional.' Yet in the same address he put greater stress on his view that the act was impolitic than he did on its injustice. The law would invite a challenge in federal court, he believed, and 'if it should be made to appear to the Court that in connection with our disfranchisement of the negro we had taken pains for providing to keep him in ignorance, then both amendments [the literacy test and racial separation of taxes] would fall together.' In other words, the disfranchisement of the almost unanimously Republican blacks, which was virtually priceless to the Democrats, would be bartered for the temporary gain of a few extra dollars of the school fund.\\"Kousser, J. Morgan. ‚ÄúProgressivism‚ÄîFor Middle-Class Whites Only: North Carolina Education, 1880‚Äì1910.‚Äù Journal of Southern History 46 (May 1980): 169‚Äì194. \\"The Negro Problem\\" Aycock's Address in Baltimore. \\"The News-Herald.\\" 24 Dec 1903. On December 18, 1903, while governor, Aycock went to Baltimore to give a speech to 300 people at the North Carolina Society. His speech, \\"The Negro Problem,\\" outlined his thoughts on keeping blacks separate, subservient, and locked out of representative government by circumventing the Fifteenth Amendment, which guarantees the right to vote. Aycock's may have been a response to the book, \\"The Negro Problem,\\" written by prominent black scholars, including W.E.B. DuBois and Booker T. Washington, in which they consider the web of economic, political, and social problems faced by blacks in their collective history as slaves and second class citizens after Emancipation. The book had been released about two months before Aycock's speech. The speech is one of Aycock's most well known, and controversial: Later life  After leaving the governor's office in 1905, Aycock resumed his law practice. He was persuaded to run for the Senate seat held by fellow Democrat Furnifold M. Simmons in 1912. But before the nomination was decided, Aycock died of a heart attack while making a speech to the Alabama Education Association in Birmingham on April 4, 1912. > The subject of Aycock's speech was 'Universal Education'. After he had > talked for a few minutes, Aycock spoke the words: 'I have always talked > about education‚Äî.'

Legacy Aycock's statue in the U.S. Capitol Memorial to Aycock at the North Carolina State Capitol In Greensboro, North Carolina, the auditorium at UNC Greensboro, as well as a street, a neighborhood, and a middle school were all named for him.\\"The risk of choosing names\\" : News-Record.com : Greensboro, North Carolina Dormitories at UNC-Chapel Hill and East Carolina University campuses were named after him, although ECU decided to rename the dorm in 2015. UNC-Chapel Hill followed suit in 2020.NC Policy Watch In Pikeville, North Carolina, there is a high school named after him as well. There is an Aycock Elementary School in Henderson, and another in Asheville. Aycock High School in Cedar Grove graduated its last class in 1963. In 1965, a junior high school in Raleigh, North Carolina was named after him, although it was absorbed into William G. Enloe High School in 1979. In the 1933 textbook The Story of North Carolina, Aycock is described as \\"one of the best friends that colored people had.\\"Zucchino, pp. 335 For most of the 20th century, Aycock was characterized by state historians and politicians as an admirable figure, reflected in the choice to have a statue of him as one of the two submitted by the state to the National Statuary Hall Collection. In recent years, that viewpoint has been challenged: > Often overlooked was Aycock's role as a leading spokesman in the white > supremacy campaigns of 1898 and 1900, which were marked by widespread > violence, voter intimidation, voter fraud and even a coup d'√©tat of the > government of Wilmington.... The campaigns had far-reaching consequences: > Blacks were removed from the voter rolls based on literacy tests, Jim Crow > customs were encoded into law, and the Democratic Party controlled Tar Heel > politics for two-thirds of the 20th century. In 2011, the N.C. Democratic Party dropped Aycock's name from its annual fundraiser after calls from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers brought attention to Aycock's white supremacy ties.\\"Vance-Aycock Dinner is history\\" : newsobserver.com : Raleigh, NC Aycock had been included in the fundraiser's name since 1960. On June 17, 2014, Duke University removed his name from a residence hall. On February 20, 2015, East Carolina University trustees voted to remove Aycock's name from a residence hall after a months-long debate with faculty, students, staff and alumni. The trustees directed the university to represent Aycock's name in another campus location, where founders and other university supporters would be recognized.\\"ECU to remove Aycock name from dorm, but retain it at another location\\" : News & Observer, Raleigh, NC As of early 2015, UNC Greensboro was also reviewing proposals to remove Aycock's name from campus buildings.\\"UNCG to move ahead with review of Aycock name\\" : News & Record : Greensboro, NC On February 18, 2016, UNCG's Board of Trustees voted unanimously to remove his name from the auditorium. On August 25, 2015, the Guilford County school board voted 9‚Äì2 to rename Aycock Middle School in Greensboro, dropping the Aycock name On August 15, 2017, the Greensboro City Council voted to rename the Aycock Historic District, which included the formerly named Aycock Middle School (now Swann Middle School) to Dunleath Historic District. On February 28, 2018, the governor of North Carolina requested from the Architect of the Capitol replacement of Aycock's statue with one of evangelist Billy Graham, pursuant to legislation signed in 2015. The statue will be replaced once sufficient private funds for Graham's statue are raised. On April 24, 2018, Greensboro City Council unanimously voted to rename North and South Aycock Street, which runs from West Florida Street to Wendover Avenue, to North and South Josephine Boyd Street after Josephine Boyd, the first Black student to attend the all-white Greensboro High School (now Grimsley High School) in 1957.

In ice hockey, it measures a player's goal differential. When an even-strength goal or shorthanded goal is scored, the plus‚Äìminus statistic is increased by one (\\"plus\\") for those players on the ice for the team scoring the goal; the plus‚Äìminus statistic is decreased by one (\\"minus\\") for those players on the ice for the team allowing the goal. Power play or penalty shot goals are excluded. An empty net does not matter for the calculation of plus‚Äìminus. The statistic is sometimes called the plus‚àíminus rating. A player's plus‚àíminus statistic is calculated for each game played, to provide a more meaningful measure over a full season. The statistic is directly affected by overall team performance, influenced by both the offensive and defensive performance of the team as a whole. History The NHL's Montreal Canadiens were the first team to track the plus‚àíminus of its players, starting sometime in the 1950s. Other teams followed in the early 1960s, and the NHL started officially compiling the statistic for the season. While Emile Francis is often credited with devising the system, he only popularized and adapted the system in use by the Canadiens. Awards The NHL awarded the NHL Plus-Minus Award each year to the player with the highest plus‚àíminus statistic during the regular season from to . The Western Hockey League (WHL) awards the WHL Plus-Minus Award each year to one of its players.  Situational plus‚Äìminus  There are some drawbacks to the traditional calculation of the plus‚Äìminus statistic in ice hockey. Not all types of goals are included, specifically power play goals. Every goal included in the calculation is weighted the same regardless of the situation - even strength, power play, short-handed or empty net. Also, traditional plus‚Äìminus is not applied to goaltenders. Situational plus‚Äìminus (Sit +/-) is an alternative calculation that takes into account all types of \\"team-based\\" goals, which excludes only penalty shot and shootout goals. Each goal is weighted based on the number of skaters (i.e. not goaltenders) on the ice. The plus‚Äìminus rating is calculated by dividing the number of skaters on the ice for the team scored upon by the number of skaters on the ice for the scoring team, applied as a plus to all players (including goaltenders) on the ice for the scoring team and as a minus for all players (including goaltenders) on the ice for the team scored upon. The situational plus‚àíminus statistic has recalculated the NHL plus‚Äìminus statistic going back to the 2008-09 season, for which the top achievements have been: NHL Top 5: Season high (since 2008‚Äì09) *Alex Ovechkin, 2009‚Äì10, +87.71 *Nicklas Backstrom, 2009‚Äì10, +74.05 *Daniel Sedin, 2010‚Äì11, +73.63 *Brayden Point, 2018‚Äì19, +72.77 *Mike Green, 2008‚Äì09, +70.76 NHL Top 5: Season low (since 2008‚Äì09) *Mike Smith, 2014‚Äì15, ‚Äì76.31 *Brendan Witt, 2008-09, ‚Äì56.22 *Filip Hronek, 2019-20, ‚Äì53.69 *Chris Phillips, 2010‚Äì11, ‚Äì52.77 *Nikolai Khabibulin, 2010‚Äì11, ‚Äì52.25 Basketball Although the statistic was pioneered in the sport of hockey, it has found its way into use in other sports and areas of life. For instance, the NBA's Houston Rockets first utilized a modified version of the stat, which helped reveal the unheralded effectiveness of light-scoring Shane Battier. It is now in regular use throughout the NBA. Association football A plus‚àíminus statistic has been used in sports economics to analyze the degree of competitive balance over time in association football.

TASS is the largest Russian news agency and one of the largest news agencies worldwide, along with Reuters, the Associated Press (AP) and Agence France-Presse (AFP). TASS is registered as a Federal State Unitary Enterprise, owned by the Government of Russia. Headquartered in Moscow, TASS has 70 offices in Russia and in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), as well as 68 bureaus around the world. In Soviet times, it was named the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union () and was the central agency for news collection and distribution for all Soviet newspapers, radio and television stations. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the agency was renamed Information Telegraph Agency of Russia (ITAR-TASS) () in 1992, but regained the simpler TASS name in 2014.  History  Historic TASS headquarters in Moscow  1902: TTA, SPTA, PTA, ROSTA  The origin of TASS dates back to December 1902 when it began operations as the Commercial Telegraph Agency (TTA, Torgovo-Telegrafnoe Agentstvo) under the Ministry of Finance, with Torgovo-Promyshlennaya Gazeta's staff being the main supplier of journalists. As the demand for non-business began during the first battles of the Russo- Japanese War in February 1904, the agency had to change its name to the St. Petersburg Telegraph Agency (SPTA). As there was no change of headquarters and almost no change in its staff and function, it was a mere rebranding. In August 1914, one day after St. Petersburg was renamed Petrograd, SPTA was renamed the Petrograd Telegraph Agency (PTA). It was seized by Bolsheviks in November 1917 and by December was renamed as the Central Information Agency of the Soviet Russian Council of People's Commissars. On 7 September 1918, the presidium renamed PTA and the Press bureau into the Russian Telegraph Agency (ROSTA), which became \\"the central information agency of the whole Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic\\".  1925: TASS  TASS building entrance with globe In July 1925 the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (Telegrafnoye agentstvo Sovetskogo Soyuza, TASS) was established by a decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, and took over the duties of the ROSTA as the country's central information agency. TASS enjoyed \\"exclusive right to gather and distribute information outside the Soviet Union, as well as the right to distribute foreign and domestic information within the Soviet Union, and manage the news agencies of the Soviet republics\\". Official state information was delivered as the TASS Report (, Soobshchyeniye TASS). TASS included affiliated news agencies in all 14 Soviet republics in addition to Russia: RATAU (Ukrainian SSR, now Ukrinform), BelTA (Byelorussian SSR), ETA (Estonian SSR), Latinform (Latvian SSR, now LETA), ELTA (Lithuanian SSR), ATEM (Moldavian SSR, now Moldpres), Armenpress (Armenian SSR), Gruzinform (Georgian SSR), Azerinform (Azerbaijan SSR, now AZERTAC), UzTAG (Uzbek SSR, now UzA), KazTAG (Kazakh SSR, now Kazinform), KyrTAG (Kyrgyz SSR, now Kabar), Turkmeninform (Turkmen SSR, now TDH) and TajikTA (Tajik SSR, now Khovar). Over the history other affiliates existed, e.g. KarelfinTAG for the Karelo-Finnish SSR. TASS news and photos were received by 4,000 Soviet newspapers, TV and radio stations and over a thousand foreign media outlets. The news agency ran one of the biggest networks of correspondents in the world ‚Äì 682 offices in the country and 94 bureaus abroad, with reporters in 110 countries. At its peak it employed nearly 5,000 people including close to 2,000 journalists and photo correspondents. In addition to producing reports for general consumption, TASS produced packages of content for non-public use. Western news reports and potentially embarrassing domestic news would be compiled daily into a collection known as \\"White Tass,\\" and particularly important news would be compiled into a smaller collection known as \\"Red Tass.\\" These collections were made available only to journalistic and political leaders, and to top journalists and political leaders, respectively. TASS was organized with five Main Editorial Boards for Union Information, Foreign Information, Socialist Countries, Information for Foreign Countries, Photo information, supplemented by a Main Directorate of Communications. In 1961 Ria Novosti was created to supplement TASS, mainly in foreign reporting and human-interest stories. After 1971, TASS was elevated to the status of State Committee at the Government of the Soviet Union. The agency was frequently used as a front organization by the Soviet intelligence agencies, such as the NKVD (later KGB) and Main Intelligence Directorate, with TASS employees serving as informants. In 1959, Alexander Alexeyev was dispatched to Cuba on a fact-finding mission, ostensibly working for TASS.  1992: ITAR-TASS  In January 1992, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a Presidential Decree signed by Boris Yeltsin re-defined status of TASS and renamed it the Information Telegraph Agency of Russia. In May 1994 The Russian Government adopted a resolution \\"On approval of the Charter of the Information Telegraph Agency of Russia\\", under which it operates as a central government news agency. The TASS acronym was, by this point, well-recognized around the world and so was retained after being redefined as the Telegraph agency of communication and messages (). The agency as a whole was referred to as \\"ITAR-TASS\\". In September 2014 the agency regained its former name as Russian News Agency TASS.

He is the original Black Ranger of the first generation of Power Rangers. He was played by actor Walter Emanuel Jones. Character history=Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Zack and his close friends Kimberly Hart, Jason Lee Scott, Billy Cranston and Trini Kwan were picked as the five original Power Rangers by the wise sage Zordon to defend Earth from the evil sorceress Rita Repulsa. Zack was chosen as the Black Power Ranger, gaining the Mastodon Power Coin and the Mastodon Dinozord. Quick-witted and clever, Zack relies on a combination of skill, strength, and agility to win his battles. The original Black Ranger is an energetic, charismatic, and fun-loving young man. He enjoys athletics (such as basketball, American football, and scuba diving), dancing (especially to a fresh beat bumping out of his friend's boombox), parties, and girls. Whenever he didn't have an arm around Trini or Kimberly, Zack could be found pursuing his attractive, but hard-to-get classmate, Angela. Zack always loved a good joke. Though he loved all the people close to him, Zack's best friend was clearly Jason. Zack is extremely confident and positive. Only four occasions saw Zack ready to give it up: when the Green Ranger took out Zordon, Alpha 5 and the Command Center while removing the Rangers from the Megazord; when his team was placed under a spell to take away their confidence; and when their Dinozords were commandeered by Lord Zedd's first monster, Pirantishead. But the first occasion happened very early in the series when his friends pretended to have forgotten his birthday. Zack went off into a secluded area, and into a trap by Rita Repulsa. For some time, he had to fight the powerful Knasty Knight alone. Oddly enough, despite his plentiful confidence, Zack is an extreme ophidiophobe, arachnophobe, and entomophobe meaning he is terrified of snakes, spiders, and insects although, on one occasion when performing magic for a group of children seeking shelter from a monster attack, he handled two fake snakes and used them to scare off Bulk and Skull. Because of this, it can be assumed that Zack's fear of snakes deteriorated over time, especially after an encounter on Rita's Island of Illusion where his strength of will was tested against his fear of snakes. Zack enjoyed martial arts just as much as he did dancing and, as a result, created his own fighting style, called Hip Hop kido. The customized art consisted of dance-like maneuvers flourished with fast and powerful strikes, much like Capoeira or as seen by actor Daniel O' Neill in Bangkok Adrenaline. This effective combination of power and prowess made Zack an incredibly formidable combatant. However, he would sometimes tone down his style and mimic the attacks of Billy to simultaneously strike opponents. He was also very resourceful. On several occasions, it was his cunning that led his team to victory. Such occasions included his discovery of the means to overcome the Knasty Knight who was sent to isolate and destroy him on his birthday- the monster possessed the ability to redistribute the Ranger's force in order to fry the weapons they used against him. When the storm-bringing chimera monster Goatan froze the Megazord, Zack analyzed what little resources the Megazord had left and used it to regain dominance in the battle. After Tommy Oliver joined the team, he and Zack quickly became close friends as a result of their similar interests. When Tommy was nervous about trying to engage a romantic relationship with Kimberly, it was Zack who Tommy sought for advice. Before Tommy appeared (or if Tommy is not at the Youth Center) Zack is usually Jason's sparring partner when practicing Karate. Tommy and Zack would also act as sparring partners for each other, as well. Though Jason was the Ranger Tommy selected to take on his Green Ranger powers after Rita eliminated Tommy's link to the Morphing Grid, Zack is the only other individual to don the Dragon Shield when Tommy gave it to him so that it's enhanced regenerative powers could heal Zack from the Oysterizer monster's acidic attack. In the Season 2 episode \\"Green No More, Part 1\\", Zack's cousin Curtis was introduced, who would have a small recurring role throughout the middle of the season. Curtis was very similar to Zack due to their similar interests in dance and music, as well as their smooth-talking speech pattern. He also formed a friendship with Trini's crush Richie. The two once even managed to fight off a group of Putties while they were skating. When Walter Jones (Zack), Austin St. John (Jason), and Thuy Trang (Trini) left the show (over contract disputes), their characters stopped making new on- screen or face-to-camera shots- simply being shown in their Ranger uniforms, using old footage, or with doubles who were never directly facing the cameras- before they were written off in the two-part \\"Power Transfer\\" episode in which their characters were chosen to attend the World Peace Conference. Zack's powers were transferred to Adam Park. Though Jason later returned in Power Rangers Zeo, Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie, and the tenth anniversary special \\"Forever Red,\\" it was never stated what became of Trini or Zack after the peace conference, although Jones did return to the show in a few episodes in Power Rangers Lost Galaxy and Power Rangers Wild Force mainly doing voicework for monsters and villains. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Pink Kimberly is the main character in this comic book mini series published by Boom! Studios. The series is a modern remake but also serves as a continuation from Kimberly's exit in the third season of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Kimberly needs to rescue a French town under siege from Goldar. She seeks help from Zordon who uses the Sword of Light to activate the latent pink energy within her. Kimberly then teleports to Zack and Trini in South America for their help. Zordon uses the Sword of Light to share Kimberly's power with them. Zack once again becomes the black ranger. It is also revealed that Zack and Trini are in a relationship. Power Rangers Super Megaforce During the final minutes of the episode \\"Legendary Battle\\", the Black Mighty Morphin Power Ranger appears and takes part in the battle against the Armada's final assault. It is assumed that it is Zack while his replacement, Adam, participates as the Green Zeo Ranger. Power Rangers Beast Morphers Zack returns in the extended trailer for Season 2 of Power Rangers Beast Morphers, set to air in 2020. However, only the Black Ranger suit is shown and it is unknown if Walter Jones will reprise his role unmorphed or through voice-over. 2017 film Ludi Lin as Zack in 2017 film Power Rangers. Zack appears in the 2017 film reboot, played by Chinese-Canadian actor Ludi Lin. He is initially introduced as a school truant with an apparent need for adrenaline, willing to attempt the team's more extreme stunts, such as jumping over a chasm. In the course of the film, it is revealed that he lives in a mobile home park with his ill mother, and Zack is her only carer. Zack is bilingual, speaking English, and using Mandarin Chinese to communicate with his mother. He is the first Ranger to try and pilot his zord, despite being told that it is only controllable once they have morphed, taking the Mastodon on a run through the hills. He rallies in time to assist the team in facing Rita in the final battle. Reception The choice of color for the Black Ranger (Zack Taylor) and Yellow Ranger (Trini Kwan) have been a source of criticism, due to the belief these colors are representations of their racial backgrounds. There are many parodies illustrating the perceived inherent racism of the show. According to the producers, this was not noticed until the tenth episode of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.

His book Sona; an auxiliary neutral language outlines the language's grammar and vocabulary. Encounters with Searight also influenced English author E.M. Forster's world-view, particularly with regard to soldiers. Searight was born in Kensington, England in 1883. He attended Charterhouse School (a boarding school) for his childhood and teenage years. In 1904 he received a commission into the Queen's Own Western Kent Regiment, and was stationed for several years in India. It was here that he befriended English author E.M. Forster (A Passage to India) and Cambridge don G.L. Dickinson. His regiment was later reassigned to Iraq, and then to Egypt. Searight also enjoyed leave time around the Mediterranean Sea‚Äîespecially in Italy. It was during this extensive travel that Searight developed his interest in linguistics and his familiarity with Middle Eastern and Far Eastern languages and cultures. At one point in his military career he was classified as an interpreter competent in \\"Arabic, Baluchi, Persian and Pushtu.\\" Searight retired to Rome in 1926. In 1934 he contacted Charles Kay Ogden to discuss publishing the Sona book. Ogden was the creator of a modified version of English known as \\"Basic English\\", which consisted of a reduced vocabulary (only 850 words) and simplified grammar. Ogden was also the editor of the Psyche Miniatures series at Cambridge University, and he approved and published the Sona book, as well as writing an introduction for it. Searight was gay. There is some reason to believe that Searight was the model for the hero of Forster's novel Maurice. Searight was also the author of six unpublished volumes of erotica, five of which were destroyed by a later owner in a moment of panic.Smith, Timothy D'Arch \\"Enumerating The Enfer\\", The Times Literary Supplement, 29 May 1981 The sixth survives: a 600-page manuscript work called the Paidikion. It was made up of homoerotic stories, a detailed listing of his sexual conquests ‚Äî the \\"Paidiology\\"‚Äî and a 137-page verse autobiography entitled \\"The Furnace\\". Ogden originally received the Paidikion, but it was later retrieved from a used bookstore for half a crown. Excerpts were published in the International Journal of Greek Love in 1966. The original manuscript is now kept in the Human Sexuality Collection at Cornell University (Rare Books Division, 7745 Bd. Ms. 1). Searight died in 1957.

Jason David Frank: Morphing From Karate Master To Mixed Martial Artist, Bleacher Report, January 15, 2010. Accessed August 20, 2010. He is a main character in the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers TV series, as well as four of its successive incarnations Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers, Power Rangers Zeo, Power Rangers Turbo, and Power Rangers Dino Thunder (where he returns as a legendary Power Ranger veteran). He also appeared in the Power Rangers Wild Force episode \\"Forever Red\\", the Power Rangers S.P.D. episode \\"Wormhole\\", the Power Rangers Super Megaforce episode \\"Legendary Battle\\", and in the Power Rangers Super Ninja Steel episode \\"Dimensions in Danger\\". He has been portrayed by actor Jason David Frank in all of his appearances with the exception of the episode \\"Wormhole\\", where he appeared only in Ranger form and was voiced by actor Jeffrey Parazzo (who played Trent Mercer in Dino Thunder). He was also infrequently portrayed by actor Michael R. Gotto in instances where the story required the character during childhood, such as in the series Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers. According to the character's history, Tommy is a legend among the Power Rangers community and is considered to be the greatest Power Ranger of all time, having been five different Power Rangers ‚Äî the Green Ranger, the White Ranger, Zeo Ranger V‚ÄìRed, the Red Turbo Ranger, and the Dino Thunder Black Ranger ‚Äî and a part of four Ranger teams over the years. In addition, Tommy is a lifelong practitioner of the martial arts; during the first season of Power Rangers, he was referred to as having a third-degree black belt in karate. By Power Rangers Dino Thunder, he is a 6th degree black belt. (\\"Return of the Ranger\\", Power Rangers Dino Thunder ‚Äì Collision Course DVD). Tommy serves as a love interest to the original Pink Ranger Kimberly Hart before their separation. He later pursues a relationship with Kimberly's successor Kat Hillard.  Fictional character history = Mighty Morphin Power Rangers  As the Green Ranger = Tommy as the Green Power Ranger. Tommy Oliver is first introduced in the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers five-part episode \\"Green with Evil\\" as a new student at Angel Grove High School. Unlike other Power Rangers, his outfit includes a golden shield armor, two golden armbands, triangles instead of diamonds on the gloves and boots, and the belt buckle is golden instead of silver. After he spars with Jason Lee Scott (Red Power Ranger) in a martial arts tournament, they begin to develop a friendship, and he catches the eye of both Kimberly Hart (Pink Power Ranger) and the evil witch Rita Repulsa. Rita decides to enchant Tommy to be her loyal servant, granting him the Dragon Power Coin to give him the power to transform into the Green Power Ranger, possessing the Dragon Shield, which makes him stronger than the other Power Rangers, and armed with the Dragon Dagger and the Sword of Darkness. She orders him to destroy the Power Rangers and their guardian Zordon so she may be able to conquer the Earth unopposed. He succeeds in his mission, dispatching of Zordon, destroying the Power Rangers' Command Center, and infecting the robot Alpha 5 with a computer virus, leaving the Rangers defenseless against attacks, but they are still able to ward him off with the Megazord. With the return of Goldar's wife Scorpina, the two wreak havoc in Angel Grove, leading the Power Rangers to use the Megazord once more, only to be attacked by Goldar, Scorpina, and the Green Ranger at once, putting the Megazord out of commission when it is thrown into the Earth's core. After this battle, the Power Rangers discover that their foe is none other than their classmate Tommy. After Tommy escapes, he uses the Dragon Dagger to summon the Dragonzord to attack the city. Zordon is revived and reveals the Power Rangers' Dinozords have been restored by the Earth's lava, allowing them to counter the Dragonzord's attack. The Red Ranger is then able to battle the Green Ranger one-on-one, and destroys the Sword of Darkness, freeing Tommy from Rita's spell. Zordon then offers Tommy a part on the team to atone for his misdeeds, and he agrees.In the original draft script for the Green Dream, Lord Zedd claims the Sword of Power was created from the remains of the Sword of Darkness. This is also stated by the announcer's intro to The Green Dream episode claiming it to be the Sword of Darkness. During his time with the group, Tommy recognizes Kimberly's feelings, having broken her heart while he was under Rita's spell, and he now begins to show affections for her. However, Rita's plan to use the evil Green Candle to get revenge on Tommy for leaving her employ, weakening Tommy, just as Kimberly returns his affections. Tommy is captured by Goldar and kept imprisoned in the Dark Dimension as the Green Candle burns down, draining him of his strength, due to the fact that Tommy's presence within the proximity of the Candle accelerates the Candle's burning process. Tommy is ultimately freed, but not before the Green Candle burns through completely. His powers nearly gone, after using them in one final battle with a powerful monster, he decides to give the Dragon Coin to Jason, permanently preventing Rita from attaining its power once more while allowing Jason to use Tommy's weapons and the Dragonzord. Tommy then leaves Angel Grove to recover from the endeavour. After Rita kidnaps all of the parents of the students of Angel Grove High School, the Power Rangers are forced to pay her ransom with their Power Coins, preventing them from using their powers. When they are double-crossed, and Rita acquires the Dragon Dagger by enchanting Billy Cranston, all seems hopeless, but Jason reveals he still has the Dragon Power Coin. The group finds Tommy once more, and with help from Zordon, Tommy is able to morph into the Green Ranger and retrieve the Power Coins and Dragon Dagger. However, his powers are now unstable and he requires constant energy boosts from Zordon in order to maintain his place as the Green Ranger. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Season 2 With the arrival of the evil Lord Zedd in season 2, the other Power Rangers are given new Thunderzords to battle his stronger monsters, but because of Tommy's unstable power reserves, the Dragonzord cannot be empowered into a new form. With this knowledge in mind, Lord Zedd sends several energy draining monsters to steal the Green Ranger's powers to the point where Zordon can no longer safely maintain himself and the Green Ranger. This culminates in the attack of the monster Turbanshell, who drains Tommy of his Green Ranger powers, trapping everyone in the Otherworld dimension, while charging the Dark Crystal to power Lord Zedd's evil Dark Rangers to attack the Earth. Tommy uses the last of his powers to destroy the Dark Crystal, ending the reign of terror of the Dark Rangers and allowing the others to defeat Turbanshell. With his powers gone once again, Tommy leaves Angel Grove, again, spending time at his uncle's lakeside cabin. = As the White Ranger = Tommy as the White Power Ranger and team leader. In season 2's two-part \\"White Light\\" saga, Lord Zedd sends his monsters Nimrod, A.C., and D.C. to attack, who easily overpower the Power Rangers, leading Zordon and Alpha to come up with a plan to recruit a new Ranger. Initially the teens are put off at the idea of a newcomer out of their loyalty to Tommy, but are thrilled once they discover that it is actually Tommy himself, who has now become the White Power Ranger with his powers created by the Light of Goodness, which are unable to be stolen by the forces of evil. Unlike other Power Rangers, his costume includes a black and golden shield armor as well as golden bands instead of the diamond shapes on the gloves and chest, and the mouthpiece on his helmet lacks sculpted lips. After being installed as the team's new leader, Tommy goes into battle using his new powers to defeat the monsters, including summoning the Tigerzord with his talking saber Saba. Tommy then meets Rocky DeSantos, Adam Park and Aisha Campbell as they were trying to save a baby who belongs to their teacher. After Rocky, Adam and Aisha discover Tommy's identity as the White Ranger while Tommy and Kimberly were trying to save Billy by removing his helmet, Jason, Zack and Trini were called to the peace conference in Switzerland as Tommy transfers their powers to Rocky, Adam and Aisha and allows them to join the team. Tommy later contends with a clone of his named \\"Tom\\", created and controlled by Lord Zedd's Wizard of Deception, who is given the powers of the Green Ranger, restored by using portion of the White Ranger's powers. With his worst fear from his past brought to life in front of him, Tommy battles Tom, initially seeks to destroy his clone under distress but he later recognizes that Tom is actually not evil but under the Wizard's spell as he was under Rita's, and then fights to save him. After the Wizard of Deception is destroyed during a series of battles that sends everyone back to the colonial era, Tom is freed from the spell and given free will. Tommy persuades his clone to fight to save people, and Tom decides to remain in the past to protect colonial Angel Grove despite Tommy offering Tom to join the Power Rangers, while the others return to the present time. Tom also keeps the Green Ranger powers. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Season 3 In season 3, Rita's brother Rito Revolto comes to Earth and manages to destroy the Rangers Zords and Power Coins. After the group seeks out the Power Coins creator Ninjor, he grants the team new Ninja Power Coins, and Tommy as the White Ninja Ranger receives the Falcon Power Coin and the new Falconzord. Later, Tommy meets Kat Hillard, who has been enchanted by Rita into serving her, resulting in Kimberly's powers being stolen as well as the Falconzord. When Kimberly is kidnapped by Kat and Goldar, the Power Rangers are forced by Lord Zedd to use the Shogunzords to destroy the Earth or Kimberly will be harmed. While Billy manages to take control of the Zords away from Zedd, Tommy saves Kimberly and Kat by freeing her from Rita's spell. When Kimberly is given the option to train for the Pan Global Games, she decides to give her powers to Kat, and she and Tommy keep a long-distance relationship. He and Kat also developed a close friendship due to their similar experiences with Rita; however, he is unaware that Kat is in love with him. The Falconzord is ultimately retrieved in time for Rita and Rito's father Master Vile's arrival on Earth, and the Rangers are able to use their new Metallic Armor to battle him. It is during this time that Tommy is tasked with retrieving the Zeo Crystal from beneath Rita and Zedd's palace, as only a being of pure heart can pass through its force field and survive. Tommy manages to traverse the Caves of Deception to find the Zeo Crystal, and the team uses their powers to split it into five pieces and send it to different parts of history so Master Vile can never use its powers to harm the Earth.  Alien / Zeo / Turbo  In the events of Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers, Tommy, the other Power Rangers, and all of Angel Grove are sent back in time by Master Vile's Orb of Doom, reverting the Power Rangers to children. While the Aquitian Rangers protect the Earth from Master Vile's monsters, Billy manages to create a device to restore them to their original age, using their six Ninja Power Coins to power it. Billy is restored to his original age, but the machine is stolen by Rito and Goldar, and Rita and Zedd destroy the Ninja Power Coins. The five child Power Rangers are sent through time to retrieve the pieces of the Zeo Crystal. Tommy is sent to a point in the past on Native American land, where he meets Sam Trueheart who leads him to a test where he must find the Red Sub-Crystal amongst two fakes. After succeeding, Tommy returns to the present time, but not before Sam gives him half of an arrowhead pendant. = As the Red Zeo Ranger V = Tommy as Zeo Ranger V Red. During Power Rangers Zeo, time is restored to normal and Tommy, with Kat, Rocky, Adam, and new friend Tanya Sloan replacing Aisha Campbell who chose to stay in Africa, is given the powers of the Zeo Crystal and the Zeo Rangers protect the Earth from the Machine Empire. Tommy remains the team's leader and is assigned to be the Red Zeo Ranger V. Later, Kimberly, while she is living in Paris for the Pan Global Games, sends Tommy a Dear John letter, ending their relationship. Kat attempts to find a new girlfriend for Tommy despite her feelings for him, but their duties as Power Rangers prevent any relationship from blossoming. Ultimately, Tommy and Kat begin dating. A holiday special during the season shows an elderly Tommy and Kat entertaining their granddaughter, and their teenaged grandson, who is hinted to be a Power Ranger. When the Zeo Megazord is heavily damaged, Tommy is given the Red Battlezord to control with his mind. Unable to control his emotions to use the Red Battlezord, Tommy goes on a spiritual journey to find peace of mind, and meets up with his long-lost twin brother David Truehart (portrayed by Jason David Frank's real brother Erik Frank). He too possesses half of an arrowhead pendant, and he reveals to Tommy that if the two halves are joined the holder could use the spirits trapped within them to control a darkness powerful enough to destroy the world. When David is captured by King Mondo, Tommy frees him, and under the stress of protecting his brother from the Machine Empire who will not leave as they are both in trouble, he reveals his identity as a Power Ranger to him. When the Rangers' ally Trey of Triforia can no longer sustain his Gold Ranger powers after a battle, Tommy recruits Jason, who has returned from Switzerland to be the new temporary Gold Ranger, reuniting the old friends. This proves useful when Tommy is brainwashed by the Machine Empire's Prince Gasket into thinking his friends are a threat to the world, as Jason and Kat are able to return Tommy to his senses. Jason leaves when Trey's health is restored. = As the Red Turbo Ranger = Tommy as the Red Turbo Ranger In Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie, Tommy and Kat are sent to save the wizard Lerigot from the evil Space Pirate Divatox, who plans on wedding Maligore, a powerful monster, in order to take over the world. With their Zeo Ranger powers not strong enough, Tommy, with the other Power Rangers- and new member Justin Stewart replacing Rocky DeSantos due to a recent back injury- are given new powers to morph into the Turbo Rangers, with Tommy still serving as team leader as the Red Turbo Ranger. They use their new powers to save Jason and Kimberly, who have been kidnapped by Divatox as sacrifices for Maligore, and Tommy's unsure feelings for Kimberly result in the group nearly losing and at the ending of the tournament Tommy hugs Kat. In Power Rangers Turbo, as he and his friends graduate from high school, Tommy becomes interested in stock car racing. The group also deals with the Blue Senturion who has been tricked by Divatox into thinking the Rangers are evil and preventing him from telling the Rangers the Millennium Message, a warning that the forces of evil are joining together out in space. After Zordon and Alpha 5 leave the Earth to deal this threat, the team's new guardian Dimitria eventually judges that Tommy, along with Kat, Adam, and Tanya, has fulfilled their duties as defenders of the Earth. In the episode \\"Passing the Torch\\", Divatox's mother Mama D convinces her that taking out Tommy will cause the fall of the rest of Power Rangers. Their new allies T.J. Johnson and Cassie Chan manage to help Kat fend off the Pirahantrons, and save Tommy from Divatox and Mama D's plans, resulting in Tommy (who is leaving for MIT) university to become a teacher, deciding that T.J. should be his successor as the new Red Turbo Ranger.  Power Rangers Wild Force  Five years after Tommy gave his powers to T.J., Tommy returns in the Power Rangers Wild Force episode \\"Forever Red\\", where he is shown to own a resort with Bulk and Skull. Tommy leads a team made up of former Red Power Rangers, recruiting the current Red Ranger Cole Evans to help stop remnants of the Machine Empire from resurrecting Lord Zedd's evil Zord Serpentera and attack the Earth. Tommy uses his Zeo Ranger powers to combat the enemies.  Power Rangers Dino Thunder  As the Black Dino Ranger = Tommy as the Black Dino Ranger. Between the events in Turbo and Power Rangers Dino Thunder, Tommy earns a PhD in paleontology at MIT. He also meets Hayley Ziktor and goes into business as partners with Terrence \\"Smitty\\" Smith and Dr. Anton Mercer, who together work on research that results in the creation of the Tyrannodrones, Raptor Riders, and the new Dinozords. A lab accident turns Mercer into the evil Mesogog, and Smitty is left for dead, until he is revived by Mesogog into the cyborg Zeltrax. It is during these events that Tommy discovers the Dino Gems, hiding them in his lab, and the location of the Shield of Triumph. While Mesogog gains control of the Tyrannodrones, Tommy keeps the Raptor Riders and Dinozords, working with Hayley to create equipment to harness the Dino Gems' powers, while he gets a job at Reefside High School as a science teacher. Three of his students who received detention‚ÄîConner McKnight, Ethan James, and Kira Ford‚Äîdiscover his lab and use three of the Dino Gems to become the new Dino Thunder Power Rangers. Tommy mentors the group, keeping his past secret, until he discovers the monsters attacking Reefside are controlled by Mesogog. His three students soon discover the man they know as \\"Dr. O\\" was one of the previous Power Rangers, a fact that Hayley corrects them on by saying that he was one of the best. Tommy, using the powers of the Black Dino Gem, joins the group as the Black Dino Ranger, controlling the Brachiozord. When the White Dino Ranger appears, Tommy's dedication to saving the lives of innocents seems to give Tommy cause to show no mercy to him, even after he discovers that the White Dino Ranger is Trent Mercer. For a while, Tommy is encased in amber by the White Dino Ranger, and once freed, finds himself unable to de-morph, due to his Dino Gem and his morpher re-molecularizing. He remains in his morphed form for a while. Despite this resolve, he cannot help but feel sympathy for Trent when his students did not, reminding the others of his tenure as the evil Green Power Ranger. After seeing the power of the White Ranger Clone and the Terrorsaurus, Tommy decides that the Rangers need an upgrade. He takes Trent to the location of the Shield of Triumph, as the shield can only be freed from its resting place by the power of Trent's Dino Gem. The Shield is then used by Conner to become the Triassic Ranger, just as a prophecy Tommy had read during its discovery foretold. Tommy is later freed from his permanently morphed status by a special substance, but is rendered invisible. He decides to run an experiment to return himself to normal, but it shatters the Black Dino Gem and leaves him comatose. In his subconscious, he battles against his previous Power Ranger alter-egos: Zeo Ranger V, the White Power Ranger, and then the Green Power Ranger. After proving that he will not give up the fight for his life, his inner selves each offer him a shattered piece of his Dino Gem, restoring him to full health and allowing him to attain Super Dino Mode when morphed. During his mentoring of the Dino Thunder Rangers, Tommy notes similarities in his past in Conner, placing a lot of trust into him. His mentoring of Conner through a point where the young man doubts himself, allows Conner to overcome these feelings and gain the Battlizer. When Tommy learns that Trent has been keeping his father's identity as Mesogog secret, Tommy considers removing Trent from the team. Although he comes to terms with Trent's loyalty to his father, he asks the others if Trent should stay, and they agree when Trent saves Conner's life. In the final battles against Zeltrax and Mesogog, having been liberated from sharing a body with Anton Mercer, Tommy informs the Rangers that they must give up their powers in order to save the world. Zeltrax is destroyed with the destruction of the Dinozords, and the Rangers give up their Dino Gems to stop Mesogog for good. In the end, Tommy decides to pursue his life after Mesogog's destruction as a normal high school science teacher.  Subsequent seasons  The character of Tommy Oliver is not present during the Power Rangers S.P.D. episode \\"History\\", in which Conner, Kira, and Ethan go to their high school reunion in 2005, wondering if Tommy will arrive, only to be taken into the future by the S.P.D. Power Rangers' foe Broodwing. Tommy does return in the episode \\"Wormhole\\" when Emperor Grumm travels back in time to take over the Earth without S.P.D.'s interference, only to encounter the Dino Rangers. According to S.P.D. Red Ranger Jack Landors, Tommy's services as a Power Ranger are well known in the future. In this episode, Jason David Frank didn't reprise his role as Tommy Oliver, and as such only appears morphed. He was instead voiced by Jeffrey Parazzo, who also portrays Trent. Although he doesn't appear on screen in the Power Rangers Operation Overdrive two-part episode \\"Once a Ranger\\", Kira mentions how Tommy would have enjoyed seeing the Operation Overdrive Power Rangers' base of operations, with Adam noting his incredulity that Tommy received a doctorate. = The Legendary Battle = Jason David Frank reprised the character of Tommy Oliver in Power Rangers Super Megaforce. He helped a boy out of a car that was dangling off the side of a bridge using Saba, the White Ranger's sword. He then appeared alongside the other Legendary Rangers including his former teammates, again as the original Green Ranger after, at some point prior, he found the restored Dragon Power Coin, to fight alongside the Megaforce Rangers and defeat the Armada. = Power Rangers Ninja Steel = Tommy returned in Power Rangers Super Ninja Steel as the Dino Thunder Black Ranger, the Mighty Morphin' Green and White Ranger, and the Red Zeo Ranger. He has a master morpher that lets him change into all of his Ranger forms (sans Red Turbo). The evil Lord Draven from the Antiverse dimension teams up with Madame Odius, to conquer all the dimensions including the main Power Rangers dimension, the RPM Power Rangers dimension and the Dino Charge Rangers dimension. He captures Tommy to make his first evil robot clone. The robot Tommy then captures six former rangers; Rocky DeSantos, Katherine Hillard, T.J. Johnson, Trent Fernandez, Antonio Garcia, and Gia Moran to make an army of evil robot clones. The real Tommy is able to break free, and with the help from Time Force Red Ranger Wes Collins, Ranger Operator Series Sliver Gemma, and Dino Charge Blue Ranger Koda, they break free the other captured rangers. The ten veteran rangers plus the Ninja Steel rangers defeat Lord Draven, and all dimensions are safe. Tommy is shown to still live in Reefside and has a son named J.J, and a wife who is presumably Kat since they were shown holding hands going back to their own dimension, and given the prediction from the Zeo holiday episode which shows an elderly Tommy and Kat entertaining their grandson.  Other versions = Comics  Frank as Lord Drakkon, in a promotional image of Boom! Studios' Power Rangers comic book event \\"Shattered Grid\\". The character also appears in the Power Rangers comic from Boom Studios. A villainous alternate version of Tommy from another universe known as Lord Drakkon is also featured, with his costume combining elements of Tommy's green and white Ranger suits. Drakkon also controls a unique Zord called the Black Dragon. Because of the chain of events including Lord Drakkon's attacks to the Power Rangers' universe, it creates an alternate reality from the television series' continuity. He also kills Tommy before he can become the White Ranger. In 2018, Jason David Frank has been involved with Boom! Studios' Power Rangers comic book storyline \\"Shattered Grid\\", about the character's war against all of the incarnations of the Power Rangers and their enemies throughout their universe's timeline with Frank portraying Lord Drakkon in its promotions. During the storyline, despite Drakkon having killed Tommy as part of his first attack, Tommy's spirit plays an important role in Lord Drakkon's defeat, with a chain of events having trapped Tommy's spirit in a crystal held in the weapon Drakkon used to kill his counterpart. When Drakkon succeeds in subverting the Morphing Grid and using it to rewrite the universe to make himself the hero, Tommy's spirit forces Drakkon to face his fundamental weakness, Drakkon having attacked the multiverse simply because he couldn't accept that he was the only Tommy Oliver to choose evil. Although Tommy offers his counterpart a truce, Drakkon chooses to die instead. After the multiverse is restored, the timeline returned to how it is supposed to be as depicted in the television franchise with no one remembering the events.  Films  1995 film = In Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie, Jason David Frank portrayed a similar version of his character from the television series, who endowed new powers from warrior Dulcea and becomes the White Ninja Ranger; he harnesses the spirit of the falcon and controlling the White Falcon Ninjazord to defeat Ivan Ooze with his team. Unlike the television series, Tommy's White Ranger costume is more of an armor than a formfitting spandex. = Power Rangers (2017 film) = While Tommy Oliver did not appear in the 2017 reboot film, Jason David Frank does have a cameo role, and Tommy Oliver is referenced in a post-credits scene, setting up his role as the Green Ranger in future sequels. Frank's cameo consists of a brief appearance of him as a random citizen of Angel Grove, accompanied by Amy Jo Johnson, where he is part of a crowd gathering after the Rangers have defeated Goldar in the Megazord, and is apparently the first person to bring out his cellphone to take a picture of the Megazord. The mid-credits sequence features a teacher in charge of the weekend detention class calling for Tommy Oliver, and the camera focusing on an empty chair with a green jacket with a dragon, draped over it. The cast of the film as well as Frank himself, have expressed interest in a female version in the sequel. = Power Rangers: Legacy Wars - Street Fighter Showdown (2018 shortfilm) = In this short film, Tommy Oliver is again played by Jason David Frank. He and former Megaforce ranger Gia Moran assist Ryu as well as Chun li in stopping criminal M.Bison and freeing a captured ninjor. During this film, it is revealed that ninjor, who created the original power coins, gave Tommy an upgrade to his suit. He now has a silver and gold helmet, as well as new weapons and a darker colored suit.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luI0jRMUjFo  Reception  Often voted as the most popular character of the entire franchise, Tommy has been criticized for perceived subtexts of racial stereotyping and American nationalism in his White Ranger incarnation. The character was only intended to appear for one season but became so popular that Tommy became a breakout character and a season regular.

Gaultheria shallon is tall, sprawling to erect. Evergreen, its dense, tough, egg-headed leaves are shiny and dark green on the upper surface, and rough and lighter green on the lower. Each finely and sharply serrate leaf is long. The inflorescence consists of a bracteate raceme, one-sided, with five to 15 flowers at the ends of branches. Each flower is composed of a deeply five-parted, glandular-haired calyx and an urn-shaped pink to white, glandular to hairy, five-lobed corolla, long. The reddish to blue, rough-surfaced, hairy, nearly spherical fruit is in diameter. Ecology Gaultheria shallon is tolerant of both sunny and shady conditions at low to moderate elevations. It is a common coniferous forest understory species and may dominate large areas with its spreading rhizomes. In coastal areas, it may form dense, nearly impenetrable thickets. It grows as far north as Baranof Island, Alaska. Western poison oak is a common associate in the California Coast Ranges.C.Michael Hogan (2008) Western poison-oak: Toxicodendron diversilobum, GlobalTwitcher, ed. Nicklas Stromberg Edibility Ripe berries of the salal plant, G. shallon The dark blue berries and young leaves of G. shallon are both edible and are efficient appetite suppressants, both with a unique flavor. The berries were a significant food resource for Indigenous peoples, who ate them fresh and dried them into cakes. They were also used as a sweetener, and the Haida used them to thicken salmon eggs. The leaves of the plant were also sometimes used to flavor fish soup. More recently, G. shallon berries are used locally in jams, preserves, and pies. They are often combined with Oregon-grape because the tartness of the latter is partially masked by the mild sweetness of G. shallon. Europe Gaultheria shallon was introduced to Britain in 1828 by David Douglas, who intended the plant to be used as an ornamental. There, it is usually known as shallon, or, more commonly, gaultheria, and is believed to have been planted as cover for pheasants on shooting estates.Wilkie, Thomas. 1890. Report upon the Rearing of underwood for game coverts in high forest. Transactions of Royal Scottish Arboriculture Society 12:371-374. It readily colonises heathland and acidic woodland habitats in southern England, often forming very tall and dense evergreen stands which smother other vegetation. Although heathland managers widely regard it as a problem weed on unmanaged heathland, it is readily browsed by cattle (especially in winter), so where traditional grazing management has been restored, the dense stands become broken up and the plant becomes a more scattered component of the heathland vegetation. Canada Used for thousands of years by Indigenous peoples, the primary non-Indigenous use in Canada in the 20th century has been as a source of florist greenery, and more recently as a ground cover in landscaping. Etymology Both salal and shallon are presumed to be of Native American origin: the former from Chinook Jargon sallal,salal, Oxford Dictionaries. April 2010.

Accessed 2 August 2012. Medicinal properties Gaultheria shallon has been used for its medicinal properties by local natives for generations. The medicinal uses of this plant are not widely known or used. However, the leaves have an astringent effect, making it an effective anti-inflammatory and anticramping herb. Leaves prepared in a tea or tincture are thought to decrease internal inflammation such as bladder inflammation, stomach or duodenal ulcers, heartburn, indigestion, sinus inflammation, diarrhea, moderate fever, inflamed / irritated throat, and menstrual cramps. A poultice of the leaf can be used externally to ease discomfort from insect bites and stings.Michael Moore, Medicinal Plants of the Pacific West, illustrated by Mimi Kamp, published by Red Crane Books, Inc. Economic use In the Pacific Northwest, the harvesting of G. shallon is the heart of a large industry which supplies cut evergreens worldwide for use in floral arrangements. It is used in native plant gardens. It is sold as \\"Lemon Leaf\\".

History The Outlaws Motorcycle Club was established out of Matilda's Bar on old Route 66 in McCook, Illinois, a southwestern suburb of Chicago, in 1935. The club stayed together during World War II, but like most organizations at that time, their activities were limited. In the 1950s, the club's logo was changed; a small skull replaced a winged motorcycle, and Old English-style letters were adopted. This design was embroidered on a black shirt and hand painted on leather jackets. In 1954, the Crossed Pistons were added to the original small skull. This design was embroidered on a black western-style shirt with white piping. The movie The Wild One with Marlon Brando influenced this backpatch. The Skull and Crossed Pistons were redesigned in 1959, making them much larger with more detail. The A.O.A. logo was adopted as an answer to the A.M.A. logo. The club featured in a work of photojournalism called The Bikeriders published in 1967 by Danny Lyon, a collection of photographs and interviews documenting the lifestyle of members of the club in the early 1960s.The Bikeriders.

The Detroit grand jury indictment included various charges, including assault and drug distribution. Eleven Outlaws leaders and high-ranking members of the gang were arrested after a five-year investigation. The FBI said several gang members were charged with conspiracy to commit assault on members of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club in Indiana. Members of the 69ers motorcycle gang killed Paul Anderson (president of the Cross Bayou Chapter in Pasco County, FL) in a targeted shooting, while Anderson was idling in a truck at a red light. Three members of the 69ers were arrested in December 2017 in connection to the killing. =Georgia= Frank Rego Vital of Roberta, Georgia, an Outlaws MC member, was shot and killed in an early morning gunfight June 24, 2007 in the parking lot of The Crazy Horse Saloon strip club in Forest Park, Georgia by two members of the Renegades MC in what has been described as a self-defense shooting after Vital and other Outlaws members followed the men from the club.

The FBI brought in a SWAT team and an urban assault vehicle to the clubhouse in the west side of the city in case violence were to break out. =Indiana= On July 11, 2012, U.S. Marshals raided the Indianapolis Outlaws Chapter clubhouse and arrested 42 members for crimes ranging from mail fraud to money laundering. Law enforcement agencies conducted the raids at dawn in an attempt to catch members off guard. U.S. Attorney Joe Hogsett said their offenses included using violence to collect debts and illegal gambling operations. =Maine= On June 15, 2010 the ATF surrounded the home of Thomas \\"Tomcat\\" Mayne. Gunfire was exchanged with the ATF, ultimately killing Mayne. The ATF was there to serve a federal search warrant for an indictment that included Mayne and 26 other members of the Outlaws, for RICO charges and for the shooting of a member of the rival Hells Angels.

According to Pennsylvania District Attorney Tom Corbett, the club sold methamphetamine in Philadelphia, Bucks, Montgomery, Chester, and Delaware counties in Pennsylvania and in Camden and Burlington counties in New Jersey. From Philly.com - website of the Philadelphia Inquirer =Tennessee= On January 1, 2010, the Knox County Sheriff's Office in conjunction with the Knoxville Police Department raided a house located at 205 Clifton Road to serve two arrest warrants and execute a search warrant on the property, alleged to be an Outlaw clubhouse. Officers, including members of the SWAT team, raided the facility just before midnight but found only a handful of elderly club members, who surrendered quickly and peaceably. Knox County Sheriff James Jones acted on information from an undercover informant who said many of the members of the club would be present at the informal celebration of New Year's Eve. Arrest warrants had been issued for Mark \\"Ivan\\" Lester and Kenneth Foster for their alleged roles in a confrontation with the undercover informant earlier in December 2009. The informant had infiltrated the organization over 14 months previous. According to Sheriff Jones, Lester and Foster allegedly threatened the informant with a pistol and demanded the colors in his possession. By Club bylaws, Club colors always remain the property of the Club and not of the individual member. The informant claimed to be in fear of his safety, and submitted to the men's demands. Mark Lester is alleged to be the Regional President in charge of the clubs operations in the states of Kentucky and Tennessee. Both Lester and Foster were arrested at the residence and were charged with aggravated robbery and aggravated kidnapping. Upon search of the residence the officers found a few legally owned handguns and small amounts of marijuana. They alleged they had evidence of other illegal activities. Both men were jailed and held in lieu of 3 million dollar bonds.\\"Sheriff raids biker gang house: Authorities serve warrants on Outlaws, two arrested\\", The Knoxville News Sentinel, Friday, January 1, 2010, Other than the charges stemming from the club's unmasking of the undercover officer, however, no other charges have been filed. All charges against Mark Lester and Kenneth Foster were later dropped. =Virginia= On June 15, 2010, a grand jury in Virginia indicted 27 Outlaws members on various charges under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) related to participating in a criminal enterprise that engaged in assaults, kidnapping, drug dealing, illegal gambling, and attempted murder. United Kingdom On August 12, 2007, Hells Angel Gerry Tobin, a Canadian living in Mottingham, London, was shot dead on the M40 motorway while returning from the Bulldog Bash festival held near Long Marston, Warwickshire. He was singled out at random by members of the Outlaws. In November 2008, seven members of the Warwickshire chapter were convicted of his murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. On January 20, 2008, there was a brawl between up to 30 of the rival clubs at Birmingham International Airport. Police recovered various weapons including knuckledusters, hammers and a meat cleaver. Four Outlaw members and three Hells Angels were imprisoned for six years each.Jail for Hells Angels and Outlaws in airport brawl, Steve Farrell, Motor Cycle News, 19 June 2009. Increased security at the court, for the period of the trial, cost around ¬£1 million. Belgium In April 2000 full-patch member Jan Wouters was killed by Outlaw Andr√© Renard in the presence of two other Outlaws on the club's domain in Mechelen. All three members were given life sentences for the murder of their fellow Outlaw. Among them was the brother-in-law of the victim. According to the three convicted Outlaws the murder took place after an argument escalated. Upon escalation Wouters supposedly aimed a gun at his brother-in-law after which he himself was killed. It was largely believed that the murder was not the result of an escalated discussion, but rather an execution approved by the club's hierarchy. On October 4, 2009 several Hells Angels and allied Red Devils performed a raid on an Outlaw MC clubhouse in Kortrijk. Shots were fired and three Outlaws were wounded before the Hells Angels and their Red Devils comrades fled the scene. The incident occurred after members of the Outlaws MC supposedly pushed over a motorcycle belonging to Red Devils MC president Johan F. in Moeskroen. The raid is also thought to be a part of a territorial dispute between the Hells Angels and the Red Devils on one side and the Outlaws on the other. Several months before the raid, on the 24th of July 2009, members of the Red Devils and Hells Angels already retaliated by setting fire to motorcycles outside an Outlaw clubhouse. Eventually six Hells Angels and two Red Devils were convicted for attempted murder and given sentences from five to twenty years in prison. On May 21, 2011 one full-patch member, one prospect, and one sympathizer of the Belgium Outlaws MC were shot and killed by rival bikers of the Belgian Hells Angels. The killings took place in Eisden, not far from Maasmechelen where the Outlaws had opened a new clubhouse just several days earlier. Two days after the murders several Hells Angels were linked to the murder and arrested, including the president of the 'Zwartberg' chapter. The funeral of the full-patch member, Freddy Put, was joined by some 200 Outlaws from across Europe. The investigation concerning the murders in Eisden is ongoing and is made difficult because within both the Hells Angels and the Outlaws there is a code of silence called 'omerta'. In a response to these murders the Belgian Army is investigating the possibility of removing members of criminal MC's from their ranks since two of the primary suspects were paracommandos. On the night of 24 December 2012, during a rock concert in Dilsen-Stokkem, members of the Hells Angels were attacked by members of the Outlaws MC. Several Hells Angels were inside the Nieuwenborgh hall listening to the evening's last rock band finishing their final songs when, at about 1:30 a.m. by local time, several Outlaws armed with expandable batons (illegal in Belgium) arrived at the scene. The situation quickly escalated into a brawl with three wounded as a result. The police quickly arrived at the scene in large numbers. One of the wounded was a 41-year-old man who suffered an open fracture to the leg.

Biography Ferrel was born in Fulton county in southern Pennsylvania. His family moved to what would become West Virginia in 1829. His formal elementary schooling was limited and he taught himself using science books well enough to become a school teacher. He attended Marshall College and despite financial difficulties, he was able to graduate from Bethany College's first graduating class in 1844. He would continue teaching in Missouri and Tennessee until 1858. At that point, he took up a full-time position on the staff of American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1882, Ferrel joined the U.S. Army Signal Service (which would become the Weather Bureau in 1891) and retired in 1886. He died in Maywood (Wyandotte county), a suburb of Kansas City, in 1891.. Work Ferrel demonstrated that it is the tendency of rising warm air, as it rotates due to the Coriolis effect, to pull in air from more equatorial, warmer regions and transport it poleward. It is this rotation which creates the complex curvatures in the frontal systems separating the cooler Arctic/Antarctic air polewards from the warmer tropical air towards the equator. Ferrel improved upon Hadley's theory by recognizing an until then overlooked mechanism. This is a quote from his first paper: > The fourth and last force arises from the combination of a relative east or > west motion of the atmosphere with the rotatory motion of the earth. In > consequence of the atmosphere's revolving on a common axis with that of the > earth, each particle is impressed with a centrifugal force, which, being > resolved into a vertical and a horizontal force, the latter causes it to > assume a spheroidal form conforming to the figure of the earth. But, if the > rotatory motion of any part of the atmosphere is greater than that of the > surface of the earth, or, in other words, if any part of the atmosphere has > a relative eastern motion with regard to the earth's surface, this force is > increased, and if it has a relative western motion, it is diminished, and > this difference gives rise to a disturbing force which prevents the > atmosphere being in a state of equilibrium, with a figure conforming to that > of the earth's surface, but causes an accumulation of the atmosphere at > certain latitudes and a depression at others, and the consequent difference > in the pressure of the atmosphere at these latitudes very materially > influences its motions.Ferrel, W.

Hadley's erroneous reasoning had been in terms of a tendency to conserve linear momentum, as air mass travels from north to south or from south to north. Ferrel recognized that in meteorology and oceanography what needs to be taken into account is a tendency, of an air mass that is in motion relative to Earth, to conserve its angular momentum with respect to Earth's Axis.

Mollo et Comp in Vienna in two books of three quartets each,Kerman, Joseph (1967). The Beethoven Quartets. New York: Knopf. consisted of his first six string quartets. They were composed between 1798 and 1800 to fulfill a commission for Prince Joseph Franz Maximilian Lobkowitz, who was the employer of Beethoven's friend, the violinist Karl Amenda. They are thought to demonstrate his total mastery of the classical string quartet as developed by Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The order of publication (numbering within the opus) does not correspond to the order of composition. Beethoven composed these quartets in the sequence 3, 1, 2, 5, 4, 6.

(1926 edition, Dent/Shedlock/Kalischer editing/translating.) \\"again\\" means, as Kerman corroborates in his discussion of the quartets, that this is a reference to the 2nd book - nos. 4-6 - not necessarily all 6 quartets, despite the editors' footnote in this edition of his letters. and Kerman makes a similar comment, leaving one to conclude that the poor Mollo edition of nos. 4-6 - which incited at least strong private protests from the composer - may also at the same time be the best existing primary source for those three works, unless manuscripts or sketches for them have been discovered. This applies only to quartets 4, 5 and 6; the situation for the first quartet in F, especially, is different, since an entire earlier version is preserved, has been published and even recorded.However, the early version of quartet no.1 - an autograph-copy sent to, and kept by, Karl Amenda before the composer gave the quartet a thorough overhaul - is little-known and has been recorded, as of July 2014, less than a half-dozen times.

Cultural competitions and games Among the cultural activities of Nova Roma, competitions and games associated with various Roman festivals have an important place. They can include a wide range of various programs from humorous online games up to serious art-competitions like the Certamen Petronianum, a literary contest of historical novel writing, where the jury was composed of notables including Colleen McCullough, author of many Roman- themed best-selling novels, and T. P. Wiseman, university professor of Roman history and former vice-president of the British Academy, or the second edition of the same competition, where the jury was Jo Walton, World Fantasy Award-winning novelist and poet.  Global chapters and subsidiaries  Nova Roma has an international decentralized administration, consisting of provincial, regional and urban subdivisions. The Nova Roman Republic is divided into a number of provinciae (provinces). A provincia can comprise of just a single country or be made of several. They could also be made up of sub-national units from a single country. Unlike the origins of the states and provinces of Canada and the United States of America, Nova Roman provinciae are creations of the senate, the 'national' governing body. Nova Roma governance permits the communities of administration for each provinciae to form their own not-for-profit or incorporated organizations, established under the respective legislation of their local country. This enables better local recognition and management, as well as provides the means for legal and insurance coverage, such as that offered by the Australasian Living History Federation (ALHF).  Australia And New Zealand  Australia and New Zealand come under one province, called Provincia Australia - so called as Australia is the prominent geographical feature in the region. Although Provincia Australia was established by Nova Roma in the year 2000, the region did not formally establish their own local organisational entity until 2019. The appointed administration established a formal local chapter of Nova Roma called Australia Nova Romana (ANR). They eventually seek to form an incorporated organisation in the near future, remaining a subsidiary to Nova Roma and reporting activities through to the Nova Roma governing body.  Germany & Germanic Speaking Regions  Germany and the surrounding Germanic speaking regions of Europe are all collectively referred to as Provincia Germania. Various small organisations have materialized through the last two decades underpinned by a public website. The latest Nova Roma community for this chapter emerged in 2020.

The quartet consists of four movements: # Allegro con brio (F major) # Adagio affettuoso ed appassionato (D minor) # Scherzo: Allegro molto (F major) # Allegro (F major) According to Beethoven's friend Karl Amenda, the second movement was inspired by the tomb scene from William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. The quartet was heavily revised between the version that Amenda first received and the one that was sent to the publisher a year later, including changing the second movement's marking from Adagio molto to the more specific Adagio affettuoso ed appassionato. Of these modifications, Beethoven wrote: \\"Be sure not to hand on to anybody your quartet, in which I have made some drastic alterations. For only now have I learnt to write quartets; and this you will notice, I fancy, when you receive them.\\" The theme of the finale is almost directly borrowed from the finale of his earlier string trio, Op. 9, No. 3 in C minor; the themes are very closely related.

This voting procedure is carried out in a parameter space, from which object candidates are obtained as local maxima in a so-called accumulator space that is explicitly constructed by the algorithm for computing the Hough transform. The classical Hough transform was concerned with the identification of lines in the image, but later the Hough transform has been extended to identifying positions of arbitrary shapes, most commonly circles or ellipses. The Hough transform as it is universally used today was invented by Richard Duda and Peter Hart in 1972, who called it a \\"generalized Hough transform\\"Duda, R. O. and P. E. Hart, \\"Use of the Hough Transformation to Detect Lines and Curves in Pictures,\\" Comm. ACM, Vol. 15, pp. 11‚Äì15 (January, 1972) after the related 1962 patent of Paul Hough.Hough, P.V.C.

High Energy Accelerators and Instrumentation, 1959 The transform was popularized in the computer vision community by Dana H. Ballard through a 1981 journal article titled \\"Generalizing the Hough transform to detect arbitrary shapes\\".  History  It was initially invented for machine analysis of bubble chamber photographs (Hough, 1959). The Hough transform was patented as in 1962 and assigned to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission with the name \\"Method and Means for Recognizing Complex Patterns\\". This patent uses a slope- intercept parametrization for straight lines, which awkwardly leads to an unbounded transform space since the slope can go to infinity. The rho-theta parametrization universally used today was first described in : although it was already standard for the Radon transform since at least the 1930s. O'Gorman and Clowes' variation is described in : The story of how the modern form of the Hough transform was invented is given in : Theory In automated analysis of digital images, a subproblem often arises of detecting simple shapes, such as straight lines, circles or ellipses. In many cases an edge detector can be used as a pre-processing stage to obtain image points or image pixels that are on the desired curve in the image space. Due to imperfections in either the image data or the edge detector, however, there may be missing points or pixels on the desired curves as well as spatial deviations between the ideal line/circle/ellipse and the noisy edge points as they are obtained from the edge detector. For these reasons, it is often non-trivial to group the extracted edge features to an appropriate set of lines, circles or ellipses. The purpose of the Hough transform is to address this problem by making it possible to perform groupings of edge points into object candidates by performing an explicit voting procedure over a set of parameterized image objects (Shapiro and Stockman, 304). The simplest case of Hough transform is detecting straight lines. In general, the straight line y = mx + b can be represented as a point (b, m) in the parameter space. However, vertical lines pose a problem. They would give rise to unbounded values of the slope parameter m. Thus, for computational reasons, Duda and Hart proposed the use of the Hesse normal form :r= x\\\\cos\\\\theta + y\\\\sin\\\\theta , where r is the distance from the origin to the closest point on the straight line, and \\\\theta (theta) is the angle between the x axis and the line connecting the origin with that closest point. left It is therefore possible to associate with each line of the image a pair (r, \\\\theta). The (r, \\\\theta) plane is sometimes referred to as Hough space for the set of straight lines in two dimensions. This representation makes the Hough transform conceptually very close to the two-dimensional Radon transform. In fact, the Hough transform is mathematically equivalent to the Radon transform, but the two transformations have different computational interpretations traditionally associated with them.CiteSeerX ‚Äî A short introduction to the Radon and Hough transforms and how they relate to each other Given a single point in the plane, then the set of all straight lines going through that point corresponds to a sinusoidal curve in the (r,Œ∏) plane, which is unique to that point. A set of two or more points that form a straight line will produce sinusoids which cross at the (r,Œ∏) for that line. Thus, the problem of detecting collinear points can be converted to the problem of finding concurrent curves. Implementation The linear Hough transform algorithm uses a two-dimensional array, called an accumulator, to detect the existence of a line described by r = x \\\\cos \\\\theta+y\\\\sin \\\\theta. The dimension of the accumulator equals the number of unknown parameters, i.e., two, considering quantized values of r and Œ∏ in the pair (r,Œ∏). For each pixel at (x,y) and its neighborhood, the Hough transform algorithm determines if there is enough evidence of a straight line at that pixel. If so, it will calculate the parameters (r,Œ∏) of that line, and then look for the accumulator's bin that the parameters fall into, and increment the value of that bin. By finding the bins with the highest values, typically by looking for local maxima in the accumulator space, the most likely lines can be extracted, and their (approximate) geometric definitions read off. (Shapiro and Stockman, 304) The simplest way of finding these peaks is by applying some form of threshold, but other techniques may yield better results in different circumstances ‚Äì determining which lines are found as well as how many. Since the lines returned do not contain any length information, it is often necessary, in the next step, to find which parts of the image match up with which lines. Moreover, due to imperfection errors in the edge detection step, there will usually be errors in the accumulator space, which may make it non-trivial to find the appropriate peaks, and thus the appropriate lines. The final result of the linear Hough transform is a two-dimensional array (matrix) similar to the accumulator‚Äîone dimension of this matrix is the quantized angle Œ∏ and the other dimension is the quantized distance r. Each element of the matrix has a value equal to the sum of the points or pixels that are positioned on the line represented by quantized parameters (r, Œ∏). So the element with the highest value indicates the straight line that is most represented in the input image. Examples=Example 1 Consider three data points, shown here as black dots. Example 1 *For each data point, a number of lines are plotted going through it, all at different angles. These are shown here in different colours. *To each line, a support line exists which is perpendicular to it and which intersects the origin. In each case, one of these is shown as an arrow. *The length (i.e. perpendicular distance to the origin) and angle of each support line is calculated. Lengths and angles are tabulated below the diagrams. From the calculations, it can be seen that in either case the support line at 60¬∞ has a similar length. Hence, it is understood that the corresponding lines (the blue ones in the above picture) are very similar. One can thus assume that all points lie close to the blue line. Example 2 The following is a different example showing the results of a Hough transform on a raster image containing two thick lines. 800px The results of this transform were stored in a matrix. Cell value represents the number of curves through any point. Higher cell values are rendered brighter. The two distinctly bright spots are the Hough parameters of the two lines. From these spots' positions, angle and distance from image center of the two lines in the input image can be determined. Variations and extensions=Using the gradient direction to reduce the number of votes An improvement suggested by O'Gorman and Clowes can be used to detect lines if one takes into account that the local gradient of the image intensity will necessarily be orthogonal to the edge. Since edge detection generally involves computing the intensity gradient magnitude, the gradient direction is often found as a side effect. If a given point of coordinates (x,y) happens to indeed be on a line, then the local direction of the gradient gives the Œ∏ parameter corresponding to said line, and the r parameter is then immediately obtained. (Shapiro and Stockman, 305) The gradient direction can be estimated to within 20¬∞, which shortens the sinusoid trace from the full 180¬∞ to roughly 45¬∞. This reduces the computation time and has the interesting effect of reducing the number of useless votes, thus enhancing the visibility of the spikes corresponding to real lines in the image. Kernel-based Hough transform (KHT)  Fernandes and Oliveira suggested an improved voting scheme for the Hough transform that allows a software implementation to achieve real-time performance even on relatively large images (e.g., 1280√ó960). The Kernel-based Hough transform uses the same (r,\\\\theta) parameterization proposed by Duda and Hart but operates on clusters of approximately collinear pixels. For each cluster, votes are cast using an oriented elliptical-Gaussian kernel that models the uncertainty associated with the best-fitting line with respect to the corresponding cluster. The approach not only significantly improves the performance of the voting scheme, but also produces a much cleaner accumulator and makes the transform more robust to the detection of spurious lines. 3-D Kernel-based Hough transform for plane detection (3DKHT) Limberger and Oliveira suggested a deterministic technique for plane detection in unorganized point clouds whose cost is n \\\\log(n) in the number of samples, achieving real-time performance for relatively large datasets (up to 10^5 points on a 3.4 GHz CPU). It is based on a fast Hough-transform voting strategy for planar regions, inspired by the Kernel-based Hough transform (KHT). This 3D Kernel-based Hough transform (3DKHT) uses a fast and robust algorithm to segment clusters of approximately co-planar samples, and casts votes for individual clusters (instead of for individual samples) on a (\\\\theta, \\\\phi, \\\\rho) spherical accumulator using a trivariate Gaussian kernel. The approach is several orders of magnitude faster than existing (non-deterministic) techniques for plane detection in point clouds, such as RHT and RANSAC, and scales better with the size of the datasets. It can be used with any application that requires fast detection of planar features on large datasets. Hough transform of curves, and its generalization for analytical and non-analytical shapes Although the version of the transform described above applies only to finding straight lines, a similar transform can be used for finding any shape which can be represented by a set of parameters. A circle, for instance, can be transformed into a set of three parameters, representing its center and radius, so that the Hough space becomes three dimensional. Arbitrary ellipses and curves can also be found this way, as can any shape easily expressed as a set of parameters. The generalization of the Hough transform for detecting analytical shapes in spaces having any dimensionality was proposed by Fernandes and Oliveira. In contrast to other Hough transform-based approaches for analytical shapes, Fernandes' technique does not depend on the shape one wants to detect nor on the input data type. The detection can be driven to a type of analytical shape by changing the assumed model of geometry where data have been encoded (e.g., euclidean space, projective space, conformal geometry, and so on), while the proposed formulation remains unchanged. Also, it guarantees that the intended shapes are represented with the smallest possible number of parameters, and it allows the concurrent detection of different kinds of shapes that best fit an input set of entries with different dimensionalities and different geometric definitions (e.g., the concurrent detection of planes and spheres that best fit a set of points, straight lines and circles). For more complicated shapes in the plane (i.e., shapes that cannot be represented analytically in some 2D space), the Generalised Hough transform is used, which allows a feature to vote for a particular position, orientation and/or scaling of the shape using a predefined look-up table.  Circle detection process  Altering the algorithm to detect circular shapes instead of lines is relatively straightforward. * First, we create the accumulator space, which is made up of a cell for each pixel. Initially each cell is set to 0. * For each edge point (i, j) in the image, increment all cells which according to the equation of a circle (i - a)^2 + (j - b)^2 = r^2 could be the center of a circle. These cells are represented by the letter a in the equation. * For each possible value of a found in the previous step, find all possible values of b which satisfy the equation. * Search for local maxima in the accumulator space. These cells represent circles that were detected by the algorithm. If we do not know the radius of the circle we are trying to locate beforehand, we can use a three-dimensional accumulator space to search for circles with an arbitrary radius. Naturally, this is more computationally expensive. This method can also detect circles that are partially outside of the accumulator space, as long as enough of the circle's area is still present within it.  Detection of 3D objects (Planes and cylinders)  Hough transform can also be used for the detection of 3D objects in range data or 3D point clouds. The extension of classical Hough transform for plane detection is quite straightforward. A plane is represented by its explicit equation z = a_x x + a_y y + d for which we can use a 3D Hough space corresponding to a_x, a_y and d. This extension suffers from the same problems as its 2D counterpart i.e., near horizontal planes can be reliably detected, while the performance deteriorates as planar direction becomes vertical (big values of a_x and a_y amplify the noise in the data). This formulation of the plane has been used for the detection of planes in the point clouds acquired from airborne laser scanning Vosselman, G., Dijkman, S: \\"3D Building Model Reconstruction from Point Clouds and Ground Plans\\", International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, vol 34, part 3/W4, October 22‚Äì24, 2001, Annapolis, MA, USA, pp.37- 44. and works very well because in that domain all planes are nearly horizontal. For generalized plane detection using Hough transform, the plane can be parametrized by its normal vector n (using spherical coordinates) and its distance from the origin \\\\rho resulting in a three dimensional Hough space. This results in each point in the input data voting for a sinusoidal surface in the Hough space. The intersection of these sinusoidal surfaces indicates presence of a plane.Tahir Rabbani: \\"Automatic reconstruction of industrial installations - Using point clouds and images\\", page 43-44, Publications on Geodesy 62, Delft, 2006. http://www.ncg.knaw.nl/Publicaties/Geodesy/62Rabbani.html A more general approach for more than 3 dimensions requires search heuristics to remain feasible. Hough transform has also been used to find cylindrical objects in point clouds using a two step approach. The first step finds the orientation of the cylinder and the second step finds the position and radius.Tahir Rabbani and Frank van den Heuvel, \\"Efficient hough transform for automatic detection of cylinders in point clouds\\" in Proceedings of the 11th Annual Conference of the Advanced School for Computing and Imaging (ASCI '05), The Netherlands, June 2005. Using weighted features One common variation detail. That is, finding the bins with the highest count in one stage can be used to constrain the range of values searched in the next.  Carefully chosen parameter space  A high-dimensional parameter space for the Hough transform is not only slow, but if implemented without forethought can easily overrun the available memory. Even if the programming environment allows the allocation of an array larger than the available memory space through virtual memory, the number of page swaps required for this will be very demanding because the accumulator array is used in a randomly accessed fashion, rarely stopping in contiguous memory as it skips from index to index. Consider the task of finding ellipses in an 800x600 image. Assuming that the radii of the ellipses are oriented along principal axes, the parameter space is four- dimensional. (x,y) defines the center of the ellipse, and a and b denote the two radii. Allowing the center to be anywhere in the image, adds the constraint 0 As discussed in the algorithm (on page 2 of the paper), this approach uses only a one-dimensional accumulator (for the minor axis) in order to detect ellipses in the image. The complexity is O(N3) in the number of non- zero points in the image. Limitations The Hough transform is only efficient if a high number of votes fall in the right bin, so that the bin can be easily detected amid the background noise. This means that the bin must not be too small, or else some votes will fall in the neighboring bins, thus reducing the visibility of the main bin. Also, when the number of parameters is large (that is, when we are using the Hough transform with typically more than three parameters), the average number of votes cast in a single bin is very low, and those bins corresponding to a real figure in the image do not necessarily appear to have a much higher number of votes than their neighbors. The complexity increases at a rate of \\\\mathcal{O}\\\\left({A^{m-2}}\\\\right) with each additional parameter, where A is the size of the image space and m is the number of parameters. (Shapiro and Stockman, 310) Thus, the Hough transform must be used with great care to detect anything other than lines or circles. Finally, much of the efficiency of the Hough transform is dependent on the quality of the input data: the edges must be detected well for the Hough transform to be efficient. Use of the Hough transform on noisy images is a very delicate matter and generally, a denoising stage must be used before. In the case where the image is corrupted by speckle, as is the case in radar images, the Radon transform is sometimes preferred to detect lines, because it attenuates the noise through summation.

Born free in North Carolina, he later lived and worked in Ohio, where he voted before the Civil War. He became the first African American to serve in the U.S. Congress when he was appointed to the United States Senate as a Republican to represent Mississippi in 1870 and 1871 during the Reconstruction era. During the American Civil War, Revels had helped organize two regiments of the United States Colored Troops and served as a chaplain. After serving in the Senate, Revels was appointed as the first president of Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Alcorn State University) and served from 1871 to 1873 and 1876 to 1882. Later in his life, he served again as a minister. Early life and education Revels was born free in Fayetteville, North Carolina, to free people of color, with ancestors who had been free since before the American Revolution.Paul Heinegg, Introduction, Free African Americans in Virginia and North Carolina, Baltimore, MD: Genealogical Publishing, 1995-2005. Quote: James Revell of Cumberland County [NC] entrusted his executor with the task of making application to the legislature for his wife's freedom [WB C:21]....Another member of this family, Hiram Revels, first African American to be elected to the U.S. Senate, was born in Fayetteville, Cumberland County, North Carolina in 1822 [Encyclopedia Britannica, Ready Reference & Index VIII:538]. Two books available online at this website, including supplementary material. His parents were of African American, European and Native American ancestry. His mother was also specifically of Scottish descent. His father was a Baptist preacher. Revels was taught by a local black woman for his early education. In 1838 he went to live with his older brother, Elias B. Revels, in Lincolnton, North Carolina, and was apprenticed as a barber in his brother's shop. Barbering was considered a respectable, steady trade for blacks in this period. As men of all races used barbers, it was also an opportunity for blacks to establish networks with the white community. After Elias Revels died in 1841, his widow Mary transferred the shop to Hiram before she remarried. Revels attended the Beech Grove Quaker Seminary, a school in Union County, Indiana founded by Quakers, and Darke County Seminary in Ohio. He was a second cousin to Lewis Sheridan Leary, one of the men who was killed taking part in John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry and to North Carolina lawyer and politician John S. Leary.Oates, John Alexander. The Story of Fayetteville and the Upper Cape Fear. Dowd Press, 1950. p. 714 In 1845 Revels was ordained as a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME); he served as a preacher and religious teacher throughout the Midwest: in Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee, Missouri, and Kansas. \\"At times, I met with a great deal of opposition,\\" he later recalled. \\"I was imprisoned in Missouri in 1854 for preaching the gospel to Negroes, though I was never subjected to violence.\\"Aaseng, Nathan. African-American Religious Leaders: A-Z of African Americans. Infobase Publishing, May 14, 2014. p 189-191 During these years, he voted in Ohio. He studied religion from 1855 to 1857 at Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois. He became a minister in a Methodist Episcopal Church in Baltimore, Maryland, where he also served as a principal of a black high school.\\"Hiram Rhodes Revels\\", Robinson Library, 2011, accessed October 17, 2014 During the American Civil War, Revels served as a chaplain in the United States Army. He helped recruit and organize two black Union regiments in Maryland and Missouri. He took part at the Battle of Vicksburg in Vicksburg, Mississippi.U.S. Senate: Art & History Home > Photo Exhibit at www.senate.gov Political career In 1865, Revels left the AME Church and joined the Methodist Episcopal Church. He was assigned briefly to churches in Leavenworth, Kansas, and New Orleans, Louisiana. In 1866, he was called as a permanent pastor at a church in Natchez, Mississippi, where he settled with his wife and five daughters. He became an elder in the Mississippi District of the Methodist Church, continued his ministerial work, and founded schools for black children. During Reconstruction, Revels was elected alderman in Natchez in 1868. In 1869 he was elected to represent Adams County in the Mississippi State Senate. As the Congressman John R. Lynch later wrote of him in his book on Reconstruction: > Revels was comparatively a new man in the community. He had recently been > stationed at Natchez as pastor in charge of the A.M.E. Church, and so far as > known he had never voted, had never attended a political meeting, and of > course, had never made a political speech. But he was a colored man, and > presumed to be a Republican, and believed to be a man of ability and > considerably above the average in point of intelligence; just the man, it > was thought, the Rev. Noah Buchanan would be willing to vote for. In January 1870, Revels presented the opening prayer in the state legislature. Lynch wrote, > That prayer‚Äîone of the most impressive and eloquent prayers that had ever > been delivered in the [Mississippi] Senate Chamber‚Äîmade Revels a United > States Senator. He made a profound impression upon all who heard him. It > impressed those who heard it that Revels was not only a man of great natural > ability but that he was also a man of superior attainments. Election to Senate Letter dated January 25, 1870 from the Governor of the State of Mississippi and the Secretary of State of Mississippi that certified the election of Hiram Revels to the United States Senate. At the time, as in every State, the state legislature elected U.S. senators: they were not elected by popular vote until the passage of the 17th Amendment in 1913. In 1870, Revels was elected by a vote of 81 to 15 in the Mississippi State Senate to finish the term of one of the state's two seats in the US Senate, which had been left vacant since the Civil War. Previously, it had been held by Albert G. Brown, who withdrew from the US Senate in 1861 when Mississippi seceded. When Revels arrived in Washington, D.C., southern Democrats in office opposed seating him in the Senate. For the two days of debate, the Senate galleries were packed with spectators at this historic event.\\"The Colored Member Admitted to His Seat in the Senate\\", New York Times, February 25, 1870, accessed October 10, 2012 The Democrats based their opposition on the 1857 Dred Scott Decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that people of African ancestry were not and could not be citizens. They argued that no black man was a citizen before the 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868, and thus Revels could not satisfy the requirement of the Senate for nine years' prior citizenship. Supporters of Revels made arguments ranging from relatively narrow and technical issues, to fundamental arguments about the meaning of the Civil War. Among the narrower arguments was that Revels was of primarily European ancestry (an \\"octoroon\\") and that the Dred Scott decision should be interpreted as applying only to those blacks who were of totally African ancestry. Supporters said that Revels had long been a citizen (as shown by his voting in Ohio) and that he had met the nine-year requirement before the Dred Scott decision changed the rules and held that blacks could not be citizens.Richard Primus, \\"The Riddle of Hiram Revels\\", 119 Harvard Law Review 1680 (2006) The more fundamental argument by Revels supporters was that the Civil War, and the Reconstruction Amendments, had overturned Dred Scott. Because of the war and the Amendments, they argued, the subordination of the black race was no longer part of the American constitutional regime and, therefore, it would be unconstitutional to bar Revels on the basis of the pre- Civil War Constitution's citizenship rules. One Republican Senator supporting Revels mocked opponents as still fighting the \\"last battle-field\\" of that war. US Senator Charles Sumner (R-Massachusetts) said, \\"The time has passed for argument. Nothing more need be said. For a long time it has been clear that colored persons must be senators.\\" Sumner, a Republican, later said, > \\"All men are created equal, says the great Declaration, and now a great act > attests this verity. Today we make the Declaration a reality. ... The > Declaration was only half established by Independence. The greatest duty > remained behind. In assuring the equal rights of all we complete the > work.\\"Congressional Globe, Senate, 41st Cong., 2nd sess. (February 25, > 1870): 1567. On February 25, 1870, Revels, on a party-line vote of 48 to 8, with Republicans voting in favor and Democrats voting against, became the first African American to be seated in the United States Senate. Everyone in the galleries stood to see him sworn in. Sumner's Massachusetts colleague, Henry Wilson, defended Revels's election, and presented as evidence of its validity signatures from the clerks of the Mississippi House of Representatives and Mississippi State Senate, as well as that of Adelbert Ames, the military Governor of Mississippi.Myers 2009, p. 129 Wilson argued that Revels's skin color was not a bar to Senate service, and connected the role of the Senate to Christianity's Golden Rule of doing to others as one would have done to oneself. U.S. Senator Revels was the both the first Black American and Native American to serve in the United States Senate. Revels advocated compromise and moderation. He vigorously supported racial equality and worked to reassure his fellow senators about the capability of African Americans. In his maiden speech to the Senate on March 16, 1870, he argued for the reinstatement of the black legislators of the Georgia General Assembly, who had been illegally ousted by white Democratic Party representatives. He said, \\"I maintain that the past record of my race is a true index of the feelings which today animate them. They aim not to elevate themselves by sacrificing one single interest of their white fellow citizens.\\"Ploski 18. He served on both the Committee of Education and Labor and the Committee on the District of Columbia. (At the time, the Congress administered the District.) Much of the Senate's attention focused on Reconstruction issues. While Radical Republicans called for continued punishment of ex-Confederates, Revels argued for amnesty and a restoration of full citizenship, provided they swore an oath of loyalty to the United States.REVELS, Hiram Rhodes. \\"History, Art & Archives,\\" United States House of Representatives. http://history.house.gov/People/Listing/R/REVELS,-Hiram-Rhodes-(R000166)/ Political cartoon: Revels (seated) replaces Jefferson Davis (left; dressed as Iago from William Shakespeare's Othello) in US Senate. Harper's Weekly February 19, 1870. Davis had been a senator from Mississippi until 1861. Revels's term lasted one year, February 1870 to March 3, 1871. He quietly and persistently‚Äîalthough for the most part unsuccessfully‚Äîworked for equality. He spoke against an amendment proposed by Senator Allen G. Thurman (D-Ohio) to keep the schools of Washington, D.C., segregated and argued for their integration. He nominated a young black man to the United States Military Academy; the youth was subsequently denied admission. Revels successfully championed the cause of black workers who had been barred by their color from working at the Washington Navy Yard. The northern press praised Revels for his oratorical abilities. His conduct in the Senate, along with that of the other black Americans who had been seated in the House of Representatives, prompted a white Congressman, James G. Blaine (R-Maine), to write in his memoir, \\"The colored men who took their seats in both Senate and House were as a rule studious, earnest, ambitious men, whose public conduct would be honorable to any race.\\"Blaine, Twenty Years in Congress Revels supported bills to invest in developing infrastructure in Mississippi: to grant lands and right of way to aid the construction of the New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad (41st Congress 2nd Session S. 712), and levees on the Mississippi river (41st Congress 3rd Session S. 1136). College president Revels accepted in 1871, after his term as U.S. Senator expired, appointment as the first president of Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Alcorn State University), a historically black college located in Claiborne County, Mississippi. He taught philosophy as well. In 1873, Revels took a leave of absence from Alcorn to serve as Mississippi's secretary of state ad interim. He was dismissed from Alcorn in 1874 when he campaigned against the reelection of Governor of Mississippi Adelbert Ames. He was reappointed in 1876 by the new Democratic administration and served until his retirement in 1882. On November 6, 1875, Revels wrote a letter to fellow Republican and President Ulysses S. Grant that was widely reprinted. Revels denounced Ames and the carpetbaggers for manipulating the black vote for personal benefit, and for keeping alive wartime hatreds:full text in James Wilford Garner. Reconstruction in Mississippi (1901) pp. 399‚Äì400. > Since reconstruction, the masses of my people have been, as it were, > enslaved in mind by unprincipled adventurers, who, caring nothing for > country, were willing to stoop to anything no matter how infamous, to secure > power to themselves, and perpetuate it. ... .

Revels remained active as a Methodist Episcopal minister in Holly Springs, Mississippi and became an elder in the Upper Mississippi District. For a time, he served as editor of the Southwestern Christian Advocate, the newspaper of the Methodist Church. He taught theology at Shaw College (now Rust College), a historically black college founded in 1866 in Holly Springs. Hiram Revels died on January 16, 1901, while attending a church conference in Aberdeen, Mississippi. He was buried at the Hillcrest Cemetery in Holly Springs, Mississippi.

He first held the seat from 2001 until his defeat in 2010. He regained at the seat at the 2015 general election, but stepped down at the 2017 general election.  Early life and career  The son of Dr. Charles Marris and Margaret Marris JP, he was born in Wolverhampton and partially educated at Warstones Primary School, before attending Birchfield Preparatory School and St. Edward's School in Oxford. He then moved to Canada and spent some time as a lumberjack, before obtaining a double first in History and Sociology from the University of British Columbia. He then completed a master's degree, working as a truck driver whilst finishing his thesis. Having decided he wanted a career in law in the UK and not being eligible for a UK grant, he spent 3 years driving trolleybuses, followed by a period as a forest fire fighter during which time he joined Greenpeace, newly founded in Vancouver, becoming world member no. 204. He was also a member of the New Democratic Party, Canada's counterpart to the Labour Party as members of the Socialist International. He served his articles of clerkship in Wolverhampton and went to work for Thompsons Solicitors, whose work he says is 90% Trade Union related, until he was elected to the House of Commons.  Parliamentary career = 2001‚Äì10  First elected at the 2001 general election, on 8 July 2007, he became Parliamentary Private Secretary to Shaun Woodward, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. In July 2008, Marris received the \\"Backbencher of the Year\\" award from The House, the magazine of the House of Commons. Marris spoke in a \\"well above average\\" number of parliamentary debates and had a \\"well above average\\" voting record. Marris emerged well from the May 2009 political scandal of MPs expenses disclosures being listed as a \\"saint\\", with minimal claims for second home. However, he was defeated in the 2010 general election by Paul Uppal of the Conservative Party.  2015‚Äì17  In May 2013, Marris was once again selected as the Labour Party's Parliamentary candidate for Wolverhampton South West in the 2015 General Election. The seat was once held by the Conservative Enoch Powell, known for his April 1968 \\"rivers of blood\\" speech in which he opposed immigration. In the run-up to the 2015 election, both Marris, his main opponent, Paul Uppal and even UKIP agreed that immigration was no longer a key issue. Marris expressed concern about zero hour contracts, foodbanks and workers earnings below living wages and whilst Uppal highlighted the improvement in community relations. In 2015, Marris introduced the Assisted Dying Bill, based on Lord Falconer of Thoroton's earlier proposals in the House of Lords. The bill was praised by Philip Collins, a leader writer for The Times as \\"a sophisticated and humane attempt\\" to clarify the law before the courts do so and which unlike religion \\"will actually ease suffering.\\" Archbishop Welby's subsequent objections were described as \\"histrionic\\" and lacking any religious reason. According to Linda Woodhead, professor of sociology of religion at Lancaster University, 70 per cent of religious people wanted the law changed. The bill was rejected by 330 to 118. A marginal at the 2015 general election, Marris regained Wolverhampton South West with a majority of 801 votes. He was appointed Shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury by Jeremy Corbyn in September 2015. On 30 June 2016, Marris resigned during the committee stage hearings on the Finance Bill and reportedly called on Corbyn to resign along with a number of Parliamentary colleagues preceding the 2016 leadership election. During the 2020 Labour Party leadership election, a video emerged of candidate Rebecca Long-Bailey, who at the time of the ultimately unsuccessful 2016 leadership challenge had been in post as Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury for 3 days, accusing Marris of having his assistant delete shared Shadow Cabinet files after resigning in an attempt to undermine loyalist frontbenchers. Marris strongly denied there was any malicious intent and said that his assistant deleted the files because the document was created by his Parliamentary office and was not the property of the Labour Party. In an interview Marris clarified that it was him who removed the shared files, not his assistant. Marris stood down at the 2017 general election, which Labour was expected to lose badly. His successor, Eleanor Smith, held the seat for Labour with an increased majority of 2,185.  Personal life  In June 2008, Marris was cautioned after causing damage, which he said was unintentional, to a van which was impeding his access to a bus stop. He is Honorary President of the Wolves on Wheels Cycle Campaign.

Since the absorption of Kalba by Sharjah in 1952, the Shamaliyah is shared by the emirates of Fujairah and Sharjah.Historical Summary of Events in the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms and the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, 1928-1953, S. 148 In 1952, Fujairah entered into treaty relations with Britain, becoming the last of the emirates to join the Trucial States. Having withheld this recognition for over fifty years, the British government only granted it because the oil exploration company Petroleum Concessions Limited (PCL) needed to sign a concession with a recognized ruler. On 2 December 1971, Fujairah joined the United Arab Emirates. Archaeological finds in the emirate of Fujairah point to a history of human occupation and trading links stretching back at least 4,000 years, with Wadi Suq (2,000 to 1,300 BCE) burials located at Bithnah and the Qidfa' Oasis. A third millennium BCE tower was used to construct the Portuguese fort at Bidiyah, identified with the Portuguese 'Libedia', a fortress recorded in de Resende's 1646 map - the fortress itself has been carbon dated to 1450‚Äì1670. Fujairah is also rich in late Islamic fortresses, as well as being home to the oldest mosque in use in the United Arab Emirates, Al Badiyah Mosque, which was built in 1446 of mud and bricks. It is similar to other mosques found in Yemen, eastern Oman, and Qatar. Al Bidyah Mosque has four domes (unlike the other similar mosques which have between seven and twelve) and lacks a minaret. Geography The emirate of Fujairah covers approximately , or about 1.5% of the area of the UAE, and is the fifth-largest emirate in the UAE. Its population is around 225,360 inhabitants (in 2016); only the Emirate of Umm al-Quwain has fewer occupants. The weather is seasonal, although it is warm most of the year. The months of December to March are generally the coolest, with daytime temperatures averaging around and rarely venturing above ‚Äîwith temperatures climbing to over degrees in the summer. The winter period also coincides with the rainy season and although by no means guaranteed, this is when Fujairah experiences the bulk of its precipitation. Rainfall is higher than the rest of the UAE, partly because of the effect of the mountains that encircle the Emirate, and partly because the prevailing winds are easterly bringing with them water-laden clouds off the warm Indian Ocean. The variability of the east coast climate is partly due to the presence of the Hajar mountain range. As with other mountainous areas, precipitation is higher, and this allows for a more varied micro-environment in the area. Tourist visitor numbers peak just before the school summer months. Population Fujairah had a population of 125,698 at the last census, held in 2005. The latest estimate of population is 152,000.Ministry of Economy, United Arab Emirates Government Fujairah is an absolute monarchy ruled by its Hakim, the ruler of Fujairah, Sheikh Hamad bin Mohammed Al Sharqi. The Sheikh heads the cabinet of Fujairah, and a few members of respected local families in the emirate make up the advisory committees. The Sheikh must ratify any decisions by the cabinet. After the ratification, such decisions may be enacted into law. Rulers * 1879‚Äì1936: Hamad bin Abdullah Al Sharqi * 1936‚Äì1938: Saif bin Hamad Al Sharqi * 1938‚Äì1975: Mohammed bin Hamad Al Sharqi * 1974‚Äìpresent: Hamad bin Mohammed Al Sharqi Economy Cement Factory in Dibba Fujairah's economy is based on subsidies and federal government grants distributed by the government of Abu Dhabi (the seat of power in the UAE). Local industries consist of cement, stone crushing, and mining. A resurgence in the construction activity helped the local industry. There is a flourishing free trade zone, mimicking the success of the Dubai Free Zone Authority which was established around Jebel Ali Port. The federal government employs the majority of the native, local workforce, with few opening businesses of their own. Many of the locals work in the service sector. The Fujairah government prohibits foreigners from owning more than 49% of any business. The free zones have flourished, partly due to the relaxation of such prohibition within the zones, as full foreign ownership is allowed there. Shaikh Saleh Al Sharqi, younger brother to the ruler, is widely recognized as the driving force behind the commercialization of the economy. Fujairah is a minor bunkering port with large scale shipping operations taking place every day. Shipping and ship-related services are thriving businesses in the city. Due to the business-friendly environment and ease of logistic support, ships trading from Persian Gulf anchor here for provisions, bunkers, repair, and technical support, spares, and stores before proceeding on long voyages. The city is also geographically well suited for such ship service- related activities. The government of Fujairah is a major shareholder in the National Bank of Fujairah, a UAE local bank. Incorporated in 1982, the National Bank of Fujairah (NBF) is active in the areas of corporate and commercial banking, trade finance and treasury. NBF has also expanded portfolio to include personal banking options and Shariah-compliant services. NBF supports industries ranging from oil and shipping to services, manufacturing, construction, education, and healthcare. Land Foreigners or visitors are not allowed to buy land. Emirati nationals can purchase land from the government, after proving their nationality. If there is no suitable land available via the official government offices, private purchases can also be made, with the eventual price being determined by the market and the individuals themselves. Developments The ruler is planning to make changes that will affect Fujairah. Among tourism projects is an $817m resort, Al- Fujairah Paradise, near Dibba Al-Fujairah, on the northern Omani border, next to Le Meridien Al Aqah Beach Resort. There will be around 1,000 five-star villas as well as hotels, and it is expected that all the construction work will be finished within two years. The Sheikh is trying to improve opportunities for the local workforce, by trying to entice businesses to locate in Fujairah and diverting Federal funds to local companies in the form of development projects. The Habshan‚ÄìFujairah oil pipeline was opened in 2012. Health care Health care is delivered in a mixed public and private system. Locals are treated for free at the federal government hospitals, while foreigners have to pay for medical care. The national government funds the federal hospitals and subsidize health care with petrodollar revenues. There are criticisms that the government is not providing health care sufficiently for those with low income, who have to pay for critical treatment themselves. The Fujairah government has built clinics, known locally as \\"medical houses\\". These clinics complement and help lighten the load on the main Fujairah Hospital by allowing walk-in appointments and providing ancillary medical services. These clinics have turned out to be a success, visited by the local populace. Education There are many government schools in Fujairah, which are mainly for Emirati people, besides some numbers of Arab residents. Aside from government schools, there are also private schools, and due to the majority of the population of the Emirate hailing from the Indian subcontinent, most of the private schools follow the Indian Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) syllabus, accredited by the Central Education Board of India. *Our Own English High School, Fujairah (which also provides International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE)), in the Al Faseel area. *St. Mary's Catholic High School, Fujairah (which also provides General Certificate of Education (GCE) A levels), in the Sakamkam area. *Diyar International Private School, Fujairah and Dibba branch. It is located in Sakamkam, Fujairah and Dibba area. *Indian School Fujairah, in the Al Faseel area. *Fujairah Private Academy, also provides International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE), A level, AS Level. *Pakistan Islamia School, Fujairah, also in the Al Faseel area. *Applied Technology High School, Fujairah Fujairah Montessori Nursery is the oldest pre-school in Fujairah. It admits children from the age of two years. It is located in the Al Faseel area. There are several nursery and kindergarten schools in Fujairah. 'Superbaby' in Al Faseel 'Smart kids', 'Mom and Kids' and 'Little Stars' are used by expat families. Travel A view of Fujairah at night Travel in and around Fujairah and the surrounding towns of Khor Fakkan, Kalba and Masafi has been made easy by the development of modern highways since independence in 1971. Highways are funded by the federal government directly, and contracts are tendered centrally. This is meant to safeguard the quality and delivery of the contracts and prevent corruption from damaging the construction. Fujairah has a very limited public transport, with a single bus service operating within the emirate and a service operating to Dubai. Aside from private transport, there are several taxis operated by the government- owned Fujairah Transport Corporation (FTC). The new Sheikh Khalifa Highway linking Dubai and Fujairah City was officially inaugurated on Saturday, December 4, 2011, following delays to the originally scheduled opening date of July 2011. It is a road that shortens the distance by . The Fujairah International Airport is near the city, with a large falcon statue at the airport roundabout. However, currently, it only offers commercial service to Abu Dhabi, a domestic destination within the UAE. Shopping LuLu Mall Fujairah opened in 2014. City Centre Fujairah opened in April 2012 with 105 units along with Century Mall near the Fujairah Ports. The construction of the Fujairah Mall was completed in 2016. Fathima Shopping Center in Fujairah is another shopping destination. Transport Fujairah is connected to other emirates by a highway called Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed highway and links Dubai and Sharjah to Fujairah within a 30 minutes drive. The road begins from the entrance of Fujairah City, crossing Al Gazirmi locality, Wadi Sahm, Asfeeni, Mamdooh, Kadra and Shawka Valleys in Ras Al Khaimah, and ends at Maleeha Road in Sharjah, at Hamda area.. Culture The UAE culture mainly revolves around the religion of Islam and traditional Arab culture. The influence of Islamic and Arab culture on its architecture, music, attire, cuisine, and lifestyle are very prominent as well. Five times every day, Muslims are called to prayer from the minarets of mosques which are scattered around the country. Since 2006, the weekend has been Friday-Saturday, as a compromise between Friday's holiness to Muslims and the Western weekend of Saturday-Sunday. Drinking alcohol is allowed at designated hotels, and as of 2000, at a few bars. Until 1998, gambling in the form of slot machines was allowed in certain hotels, but personal petitions by locals to the Sheikh outlawed the activity. Some players were losing entire monthly wages on the slots, leaving nothing for the upkeep of their families. Groups of Emirati youths tend to socialize together on the streets and caf√©s or outside games arcades, cinemas, and mini-malls. It is unusual to see mixed-sex groups due to gender segregation in Emirati society. On vacations, many Fujairah residents travel to western emirates such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi, for entertainment and shopping purposes. They also visit the Wadis surrounding the emirate on camping and hiking trips. At the same time, other emirates' residents visit Fujairah for relaxation purposes and to get away from the stifling heat of the desert. Watersports are becoming more and more popular amongst both locals and tourists. Examples of watersports are jet skis, windsurfing, waterskiing and diving. Professional driving instructors can be found in Le Meridien or in Royal Beach Hotel, where one can obtain an International Driving License, for a fee.

The city of Ras Al Khaimah, sometimes simply abbreviated to RAK or RAK City, is the capital of the emirate and home to most of the emirate's residents. It is linked to the medieval trading port of Julfar. Its name in English means \\"top of the tent\\". The emirate borders Oman's exclave of Musandam, and occupies part of the same peninsula. It covers an area of and has of beach coastline. As of 2020, the emirate had a population of about 191,753, of which about 31% were Emirati citizens. RAK city has two main areas - the Old Town and Nakheel - on either side of a creek that is home to mangroves and is framed by the North-Western Hajar Mountains. The emirate also consists of several villages and new gated residential developments, such as Al Hamra Village and Mina Al Arab. The emirate is served by Ras Al Khaimah International Airport. Its geography consists of a northern part (where Ras Al Khaimah City and most towns are situated) and a large southerly inland exclave (near the Dubai exclave of Hatta), and a few small islands in the Persian Gulf. Ras Al Khaimah has the most fertile soil in the country, due to a larger share of rainfall and underground water streams from the Hajar. History A tomb from the Umm al-Nar culture in Ras Al Khaimah. Ras Al Khaimah has been the site of continuous human habitation for 7,000 years, one of the few places in the country and the world where this is the case, and there are many historical and archaeological sites throughout the emirate - local sources cite 1,000 \\\\- dating from different time periods, including remnants of the Umm Al Nar Culture (3rd millennium BC). The area of Shimal contains both Umm Al Nar and Wadi Suq burials and a number of notable finds, including one grave that contained no fewer than 18 fine bronze arrowheads. Pirate coast British Expeditionary Force of 1809 off the coast of Ras Al Khaimah in 1809. There is considerable debate locally regarding the 18th-century charge of maritime piracy, attracting the British label 'The Pirate Coast' to the Eastern Gulf. Local interpretations of the dispute with the British were that the British became increasingly aggressive in protecting their trade but this resulted in interference in locals' livelihoods, so they naturally took exception to it. However, in the early 18th century, the Al Qasimi dynasty established itself in Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah on the Arabian Peninsula, growing to become a significant maritime force with holdings on both the Persian and Arabian coasts that frequently came into conflict with British flagged shipping. It was the Al Qasimi links to Persia that drew them to the attention of Ahmed bin Said, the Ruler of Muscat, who had wrested control of the coast and interior of Oman back from the Persian forces who had taken it under Nadir Shah and Mirza Taki Khan, the governor of Shiraz. Ahmed bin Said threw 12,000 men under the command of Kandhala bin Saif Al Suwaidi in an attack on Ras Al Khaimah which was met at Buraimi by 14,000 men of the Al Qasimi and Na'im. They were defeated, leading the garrison at Khor Fakkan, besieged by Ahmed bin Said, to surrender. He went on to take Khasab and then blockaded Ras Al Khaimah, Rams, Jazirat Al Hamra, Fasht and Sharjah. This led to all but Ras Al Khaimah suing for peace in 1763. The Sheikhs of Ras Al Khaimah submitted in 1771, but in 1775 revolted and re-took the towns on the West and East coast, consolidating their gains under the weak rule of Sultan bin Ahmed bin Saeed. This longstanding war between the Al Qasimi and Muscat pitted them naturally against Muscat's ally ‚Äì Britain. In the aftermath of a series of attacks in 1808 off the coast of Sindh involving 50 Qasimi raiders and following the 1809 monsoon season, the British authorities in India decided to make a significant show of force against the Al Qasimi, in an effort not only to destroy their larger bases and as many ships as could be found, but also to counteract French encouragement of them from their embassies in Persia and Oman. The British mounted the Persian Gulf campaign of 1809, in which the Al Qasimi fleet was largely destroyed. The British operation continued to Linga on the Persian coast which was, like the Greater and Lesser Tunbs islands, administered by the Al Qasimi. By the morning of 14 November, the military expedition was over and the British forces returned to their ships, having suffered light casualties of five killed and 34 wounded. Arab losses are unknown, but were probably significant, while the damage done to the Al Qasimi fleets was severe: a significant portion of their vessels had been destroyed. =1819 campaign= British Expeditionary force of 1819 in December 1819 With the 1809 campaign concluded without significant treaty concessions, an 1815 arrangement was made between the British and the Al Qasimi. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. By 1819, it was clear the arrangement had broken down and so in November of that year, the British embarked on a second expedition against the Al Qasimi, led by Major- General William Keir Grant, voyaging to Ras Al Khaimah with a force of 3,000 soldiers. The British extended an offer to Said bin Sultan of Muscat in which he would be made the ruler of the Pirate Coast if he agreed to assist the British in their expedition. Obligingly, he sent a force of 600 men and two ships. The force gathered off the coast of Ras Al Khaimah on 25 and 26 November and, on 2 and 3 December, troops were landed south of the town and set up batteries of guns and mortars and, on 5 December, the town was bombarded from both land and sea. Continued bombardment took place over the following four days until, on the 9th, fortress and town of Ras Al Khaimah were stormed and found to be practically deserted. On the fall of Ras Al Khaimah, three cruisers were sent to blockade Rams to the North and this, too was found to be deserted and its inhabitants retired to the 'impregnable' hill-top fort of Dhayah. The British landed a force at Rams on 18 December, which fought its way inland through date plantations to the hilltop fort of Dhayah on the 19th. There, 398 men and another 400 women and children held out, without sanitation, water or effective cover from the sun, for three days under heavy fire from mortars and 12-pound cannon. The hilltop fort of Dhayah The two 24-pound cannon from HMS Liverpool which had been used to bombard Ras Al Khaimah from the landward side were once again pressed into use and dragged across the plain from Rams, a journey of some four miles. Each of the guns weighed over 2 tonnes. After enduring two hours of sustained fire from the big guns, which breached the fort's walls, the last of the Al Qasimi surrendered at 10.30 on the morning of 22 December. =1820 treaty= In January 1820, the British imposed the General Maritime Treaty of 1820 signed by Sheikh Sultan Bin Saqr Al Qasimi of Sharjah who was reinstated by the British in Ras Al Khaimah after the deposition of Hasan Bin Rahma Al Qasimi. The treaty stipulated the end of piracy and slavery, and laid the foundation for the British protectorate over the Trucial States that lasted until December 1971. In 1869, Ras Al Khaimah became fully independent from neighbouring Sharjah. However, from September 1900 to 7 July 1921, it was re-incorporated into Sharjah; the last governor became its next independent ruler. Joining the United Arab Emirates On 10 February 1972,Kourosh Ahmadi, Islands and International Politics in the Persian Gulf: The Abu Musa and Tunbs in Strategic Context (Routledge, 2008) p96 Ras Al Khaimah, under the leadership of Sheikh Saqr bin Mohammad al-Qasimi, joined the United Arab Emirates. Modern History A partnership formed in 2020 between Ras Al Khaimah's Antiquities and Museums Department and two U.S. universities - University of South Alabama and Quinnipiac University in Connecticut - has led to 4,000-year-old human remains found in Shimal being studied for the first time. Wadi Suq era graves found at Seih Al Harf in the Emirate in October 2012 briefly held up the construction of the northern spur of the arterial E611 road. Ras Al Khaimah is linked with the medieval port and city of Julfar and it overtook Julfar as the commercial center of the area in the late 16th century. Ras Al Khaimah was an independent settlement but it eventually grew to encapsulate the area known as Julfar. By the end of the 16th century, Italian sources mention Ras Al Khaimah for the first time, after which the name Julfar fell out of usage. Archaeological evidence has demonstrated that the settlement known as Julfar shifted location over time as harbour channels silted up. Excavations of a sizable tell, which revealed remnants of a Sassanid era fortification, indicate that early Julfar was located in the north of the present city of Ras Al Khaimah, not far from other sites of historical and archaeological interest such as the Pre-Islamic Shimal Fort, known locally as 'Sheba's Palace'. One of Ras Al Khaimah's most celebrated sons, Ibn Majid, was a seaman and navigator.

In the 2020 iteration, Ethiopia's Ababel Yeshaneh broke the women's half marathon world record by 20 seconds with a time of 1:04:31, eclipsing the previous record of 1:04:51 set by Kenyan Joyciline Jepkosgei in Valencia in 2017. The UAE Awafi Festival is an annual cultural and heritage festival held in the Ras Al Khaimah desert. It is a three-week event, held in December or January, one attraction being a sand dune race. There is a heritage village with traditional food and dance, as well as shops for food and souvenirs. The Terry Fox Run RAK is a yearly charity run organized in Ras Al Khaimah to support cancer research in the UAE. The first event was organized in 2010. Participation in this event has grown from hundreds to thousands since its inception, averaging about 5,000 participants in recent years. Ras Al Khaimah Fine Arts Festival is an annual event that has taken place since 2013, organised by the Al Qasimi Foundation for Policy Research. It started with just 26 artists but by 2018 that number had grown to 84. The not-for-profit festival takes place every February-March and since 2019 has taken place at the redeveloped Al Jazirah Al Hamra Heritage Village. Each year, a number of events are lined up in Ras Al Khaimah to mark the United Arab Emirates' National Day, usually involving an air show by the Fursan Al Emarat aerobatics team and a free concert featuring some of the best singers in the Arab world. In 2018, Ras Al Khaimah became the new host for the season-ending tournament on the Challenge Tour, the second tier of European Tour golf. The \\"Road to Ras Al Khaimah\\" ends with the Ras Al Khaimah Challenge Tour Grand Final played at Al Hamra Golf Course. Infrastructure=Transportation Ras Al Khaimah International Airport Within Ras Al Khaimah city, the main mode of public transport are metered taxis, with public buses operating on long-haul routes and catering mainly to smaller towns (e.g. Sha\`am, Rams, and Al Jazirah Al Hamra). A local bus service operated by RAK Transport Authority provides infrequent connections between Nakheel, Al Hamra and the airport. In November 2019, RAK Transport Authority launched its five-year strategy for 2020‚Äì2025, part of which involved making its entire fleet of cars eco-friendly. At the time, 60% of its fleet of 850 taxis were already hybrid. Ras Al Khaimah is connected to the other emirates by taxis and buses which embark from the Bus station located at RAK Transport Authority Headquarters near the new Ras Al Khaimah Police Headquarters and opposite the Cove Rotana hotel. The main highways linking Ras Al Khaimah with other emirates is Mohammed bin Zayed Road (E311) and Emirates Road (E611), both of which travel from Ras Al Khaimah through Umm Al Quwain, Ajman and Sharjah and onto Dubai and Abu Dhabi. These highways allow for journeys from Ras Al Khaimah to Dubai in under 45 minutes. Dual carriageways connect major areas within the emirate, with one following the coast and another running inland towards the airport in the direction of Khatt, Masafi, Fujairah, Dhaid, and eventually Oman. In July 2018, the first phase of the Ras Al Khaimah Ring Road opened, connecting the industrial areas of the mountainous north with the E311 to the south. The road has decreased the volume of industrial traffic through RAK City. In spring 2013 work on the RAK Ring Road was held up by a three-month rescue excavation after the discovery of megalithic tombs dating to the Wadi Suq period, from 2000 to 1600 BC. Saqr Port, located in the industrial area of Khor Khwair, is the emirate's main port, providing bulk and container services. It is the largest bulk- handling port in the Middle East. It has eight deep-water berths, each long, is dredged to and has two \\"ro-ro\\" ramps plus specialised berths for handling bulk cement and aggregate. Other services include ship-handling, crew changes, and of covered storage, together with a vast open storage area. It is also the closest port in the UAE to Bandar Abbas, Iran, but there is no shipping from Saqr port to Bandar Abbas. Ras Al Khaimah International Airport (RKT) offers cargo and passenger services to a variety of destinations covering the Middle East, North & East Africa, Central Asia, the Indian Subcontinent and Europe (to Luxembourg). It serves as a hub for low-cost carrier Air Arabia and, in May 2019, it was announced that direct flights operated by Pegasus airline would commence to Istanbul, Turkey, from Ras Al Khaimah in October 2019. SpiceJet, India's second largest carrier, announced in October, 2019 that RAK Airport would become its first overseas hub in a deal that brought with it direct flights from the Indian capital New Delhi to Ras Al Khaimah. On 17 February 2006, Space Adventures announced its plans to develop a $265 million commercial spaceport in Ras Al Khaimah for space tourism. This plan has yet to be realized.

It is the second smallest and least populous Emirate in the UAE. The closest body of water near it is the Persian Gulf. The emirate is ruled by Saud bin Rashid Al Mualla. The current crown prince is Rashid bin Saud bin Rashid Al Mua'lla, and the deputy ruler is Abdullah bin Rashid Al Mualla III. It had 72,000 inhabitants in 2007 and has an area of . The emirate consists in the main of the coastal city of Umm Al Quwain and the inland oasis town of Falaj Al Mualla, some from the coast. Unlike some of its neighbours, Umm Al Quwain has not made any significant find of oil or gas in its territory and depends on revenue from hotels, parks and tourism, fisheries and general trading activities as well as the Umm Al Quwain Free Trade Zone (UAQFTZ) based at Port Ahmed Bin Rashid. A number of government initiatives and strategies have been put in place to incentivise growth in trade and industrial activity in the emirate, including a 2018 move to reduce government fees to business and waive fines and violations levied against businesses which had not renewed their trade licenses. Etymology Multiple theories have been established on the etymology of the name Umm Al Quwain. The most accepted meaning is that the name means \\"mother of the two powers\\" - from the phrase \\"Umm Al Quwatain\\" (). The two powers here are usually indicated as the two forms of geographical powers. Locals describe it as the richness of activities both on land and water, others refer to it as the two powers of economy and agriculture. Another theory is that the word \\"Quwain\\" is inspired by an Arabic word \\"Qawn\\" meaning ‚Äòiron‚Äò. Therefore, some believe that it may refer to iron in the place. History and prehistory Umm Al Quwain holds significant archaeological interest, with major finds at both Tell Abraq and Ed-Dur pointing to significant Ancient Near Eastern Cities. Arrowheads and other polished flint tools have been unearthed in various sites across the UAE while pieces of Ubaid Age pottery have been unearthed along the shores of the emirate. All evidence obtained so far indicate that contact with Mesopotamia existed as early as the 5th millennium BC, as an indigenous ceramic industry, did not emerge until the 3rd century BC. Finds at both Tell Abraq and Ed-Dur show habitation in the area throughout the Bronze Age, from the Hafit period, through the Umm Al Nar period and the later Wadi Suq and Iron I, II and III ages. Finds also link Ed-Dur with the inland settlement of Mleiha, especially distinctive burials of animals with their heads turned back on their bodies. Significant trading links with both the Western Sumerian culture and the Eastern Indus Valley culture are displayed at these sites, with the semi- nomadic Magan people smelting bronze mined in the Hajar Mountains and then shipping the smelted ore. Macedonian coinage unearthed at Ed-Dur dates back to Alexander the Great, while hundreds of coins have been found bearing the name of Abi'el. In March 2019, 15 tombs, bronze statues, settlement remains, jewellery and pottery, dating back to the 1st century CE, were unearthed here. It is thought Ed-Dur is the site of Omana, mentioned by both Pliny and Strabo as an important town in the Lower Persian Gulf. During the Bronze Age, agriculture flourished, with dates being the prominent crop. Wheat, millet and other grains were also cultivated wherever there was enough water for irrigation. It is now widely believed that the climate during the period was more temperate than now. 20th century The protective wall and watchtowers guarding the old town of Umm Al Quwain Umm Al Quwain was the site of a fort built in 1768 by the founder of the modern Al Mualla dynasty, Sheikh Rashid bin Majid of the Al Ali tribe. On 8 January 1820, Sheikh Abdullah bin Rashid signed the General Maritime Treaty with the United Kingdom, thus accepting a British protectorate in order to keep the Ottoman Turks out. Like Ajman, Dubai, Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah, its position on the route to India made it important enough to be recognized as a salute state with a three gun salute. By 1908, J. G. Lorimer's famous survey of the Trucial Coast, the Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman and Central Arabia, had Umm Al Quwain listed as a town of some 5,000 inhabitants and identified as the major boat- building centre on the coast, producing some 20 boats a year compared to 10 in Dubai and 5 in Sharjah. On 2 December 1971, Sheikh Ahmad bin Rashid joined its neighbors Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman and Fujairah in forming the United Arab Emirates, with Ras Al-Khaimah joining later in early 1972. =Petrochemicals= The American oil company Occidental acquired a concession to search for oil in Umm Al Quwain territorial waters on 19 November 1969. Occidental proposed drilling an exploratory well nine miles from the island of Abu Musa in the Persian Gulf in what it considered to be Umm Al Quwain waters. However, this conflicted with a 12-mile territorial limit claimed by Sharjah. On 15 May 1970, the British authorities referred the dispute to arbitration, but ruled that Occidental could continue to drill. On 20 May, Iran informed the British that it laid claim to Abu Musa and the two Tunbs' islands, and would intercede if Occidental continued to drill. The British proposed a three-month suspension of drilling pending the outcome of arbitration, a decision enforced by a British minesweeper, which intercepted Occidental's drilling platform and moved it out of the area. The agreement between Sharjah and Iran over the island of Abu Musa, made on 29 November 1971 and the subsequent invasion of the islands on 30 November 1971 rendered the issue moot. Occidental would never find oil under its Umm Al Quwain concession. Rulers The successive rulers of Umm Al Quwain were: * 1768‚Äì1820: Sheikh Rashid bin Majid Al Mualla * 1820‚Äì1853: Sheikh Abdullah bin Rashid Al Mualla (b.1794) * 1853‚Äì1873: Sheikh Ali bin Abdullah Al Mualla (b.1824 ‚Äì d.1873) * 1873‚Äì1904: Sheikh Ahmad bin Abdullah Al Mualla (b. 1832 ‚Äì d. 1904) * 13 June 1904 ‚Äì 1922: Sheikh Rashid bin Ahmad Al Mualla (b. 1876 ‚Äì d. 1922) *1922 ‚Äì October 1923: Sheikh Abdullah bin Rashid Al Mualla II * October 1923 ‚Äì 9 February 1929: Sheikh Hamad bin Ibrahim Al Mualla * 9 February 1929 ‚Äì 21 February 1981: Sheikh Ahmad bin Rashid Al Mualla (b. 1904 ‚Äì d. 1981) * 21 February 1981 ‚Äì 2 January 2009: Sheikh Rashid bin Ahmad Al Mualla II (b. 1932 ‚Äì d. 2009) * 2 January 2009‚Äìpresent: Sheikh Saud bin Rashid Al Mualla (b. 1952) Climate and environment desert landscape of Umm Al- Quwain During November to March, the average temperature is by day and at night, but it can rise to over in the peak of the summer and when humidity levels are high. The rainfall is minimal and averages a year. The coastline experiences cooling sea breezes during the day. Al Sinniyah island, close to the city of Umm Al Quwain is home to the UAE's largest Socotra cormorant colony, with over 15,000 pairs making it the third largest colony in the world. Arabian gazelles have been introduced to Sinniyah and appear to be prospering. Marine life is remarkable for its abundance and diversity. Blacktip reef sharks patrol the outer shoreline, while green turtles are ubiquitous in the inner leads in particular. Between Al Sinniyah and the mainland is Khor Al Beidah, an expansive area of sand and mud flats of international importance for its waterfowl. Although not formally protected, the island of Sinaiyah, along with Khor Al Beidah, is one of the largest areas of undisturbed and varied coastal environment remaining anywhere in the UAE. Culture The UAE culture mainly revolves around the religion of Islam and traditional Arab culture. The influence of Islamic and Arab culture on its architecture, music, attire, cuisine and lifestyle are very prominent as well. Five times every day, Muslims are called to prayer from the minarets of mosques which are scattered around the country. Since 2006, the weekend has been Friday-Saturday, as a compromise between Friday's holiness to Muslims and the Western weekend of Saturday-Sunday. Tourism Umm Al Quwain Fort * Umm Al Quwain Fort: A fort which was once home to the emirate's ruler and guarded the entrance to the old town, overseeing the sea on one side and the creek on the other. It eventually became a police station then a museum. The museum now houses artifacts found at important nearby sites including Ed-Dur and houses a collection of weapons that were used through the emirate's history. It is located near a Masjid (Mosque) in Umm Al Quwain Bazaar. * Old Harbour: An old harbour located in the old town overlooking the traditional dhow building yard where skilled craftsmen continue to assemble these traditional boats. The harbor is surrounded by old coral stone houses that display features of the original architecture and intricate sculptured plaster work. * Islands of Umm Al Quwain: Islands that lie to the east of the mainland peninsula on a unique stretch of coastline consisting of sandy islands surrounded by dense mangrove forests, separated by a series of creeks. The largest of the seven islands is Al Sinniyah, followed by Jazirat Al Ghallah and Al Keabe, all of which are visible from the old town. Tucked in between these and the coastal plains are the smaller islands of Al Sow, Al Qaram, Al Humaidi, Al Chewria and Al Harmala. The Madaar creek that runs between the islands provides a navigable waterway for fisherman even at low tide when the average depth is less than a few feet. * Ed-Dur: Located to the north of Umm Al Quwain, the ancient near eastern city of Ed-Dur is considered the largest pre-Islamic site on the Persian Gulf coast. There are two public monuments at Al-Dour, a small square fort with round corner towers and a small square temple dedicated to the Semitic sun god Shamash. The site is not open to the public. * Dreamland Aqua Park: the largest water park in the UAE is located on the coastline of Umm Al Quwain; about 40 minutes drive from Dubai, with expanse of landscaped gardens and over 30 rides, slides, and attractions. The Park is operated all year round with a daily capacity of ten thousand visitors.

He unsuccessfully ran for president in the 1995 French presidential election, coming in third place. At age , Balladur is currently the oldest living former French Prime Minister. Biography Balladur was born in Izmir, Turkey, to an ethnic Armenian family with five children and longstanding ties to France. His family emigrated to Marseille in the mid-to-late 1930s. In 1957, Balladur married Marie-Jos√®phe Delacour, with whom he had four sons. Early political career Balladur started his political career in 1964 as an advisor to Prime Minister Georges Pompidou. After Pompidou's election as President of France in 1969, Balladur was appointed under-secretary general of the presidency then secretary general from 1973 to Pompidou's death in 1974. He returned to politics in the 1980s as a supporter of Jacques Chirac. A member of the Neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR) party, he was the theoretician behind the \\"cohabitation government\\" from 1986 to 1988, explaining that if the right won the legislative election, it could govern with Chirac as prime minister without Socialist Party President Fran√ßois Mitterrand's resignation. As Minister of Economy and Finance, he sold off a large number of public companies and abolished the wealth tax. Balladur appeared as an unofficial deputy Prime Minister in the cabinet led by Chirac. He took a major part in the adoption of liberal and pro-European policies by Chirac and the RPR. After Chirac's defeat at the 1988 presidential election, part of the RPR held him responsible of the abandonment of Gaullist doctrine, but he kept the confidence of Chirac. Prime Minister When the RPR/UDF coalition won the 1993 legislative election, Chirac declined to become Prime Minister again in a second \\"cohabitation\\" with President Mitterrand, and Balladur became Prime Minister. He was faced with a difficult economic situation, but he did not want to make the political errors of the previous cohabitation government. If he failed to impose his project of minimum income for youth, he led a moderate liberal policy in economy. Conveying the image of a quiet conservative, he did not question the wealth tax (reestablished by the Socialists in 1988). Despite corruption affairs affecting some of his ministers, who he forced to resign (thus lending his name to the so-called \\"Balladur jurisprudence\\"), he became very popular and had the support of influential media. 1995 presidential election When he became Prime Minister, Balladur had promised Chirac that he would not enter the 1995 presidential election, and that he would support Chirac's candidacy. However, a number of right-wing politicians advised Balladur to run for the presidency in 1995. He went back on his promise to Chirac and entered the campaign. When he announced his candidacy, four months before the election, he was considered the favourite. In the polls, he led Chirac by almost 20 points. However, from the position of an outsider, Chirac criticized Balladur as representing \\"dominant ideas\\", and the difference between the two decreased quickly. The revelation of a bugging scandal which implicated Balladur also contributed to a drop in his popularity among voters. In the first round of the election, Balladur finished in third place with 18.6% of the vote behind the Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin and Chirac. He was thus eliminated from the final run- off election between the top two candidates, which Chirac won. Chirac immediately appointed Alain Jupp√© to replace Balladur as Prime Minister. Despite Chirac declaring that he and Balladur had been \\"friends for 30 years\\", Balladur's decision to stand against him greatly strained their relationship. As a result, the \\"Balladuriens\\" who had supported him in the presidential election, such as Nicolas Sarkozy, were ostracized from the new Chirac administration. Later political career Balladur failed to win the elections for the presidency of the √éle-de-France region in 1998, the RPR nomination for the mayoralty of Paris in 2001, and the Chair of the National Assembly in 2002. He presided over the National Assembly's foreign affairs committee during his last parliamentary term (2002‚Äì2007). Since the 1980s, he had advocated the unification of the right-wing groupings into a single large party, but it was Chirac who managed the feat, with the creation of the Union for a Popular Movement in 2002. Following the 2007 French presidential election, Nicolas Sarkozy nominated Balladur to the head of a committee for institutional reforms. The constitutional revision was approved by the Parliament in July 2008. From 1968 to 1980, Balladur was president of the French company of the Mont Blanc Tunnel while occupying various other positions in ministerial staff. Following the 1999 deadly accident in the tunnel, he gave evidence to the court judging the case in 2005 about the security measures he had or had not taken. Balladur claimed that he always took security seriously, but that it was difficult to agree on anything with the Italian company operating the Italian part of the tunnel. From 1977 to 1986, he was president of G√©n√©rale de Service Informatique (later merged into IBM Global Services), making him one of the few French politicians with business experience. In 2006, he announced that he would not run again for re- election in 2007 as a member of Parliament for the 15th arrondissement of Paris, a conservative stronghold. In 2008, Balladur visited the United States to speak at an event organized by the Streit Council, a Washington-based think tank. Balladur presented his latest book, in which he outlined a concept for a \\"Union of the West\\". Balladur is often caricatured as aloof, aristocratic, and arrogant in media, such as the Canard Encha√Æn√© weekly or the Les Guignols de l'info TV show. Incidentally, the percentage of French government ministers who were also members of Le Si√®cle peaked at 72% under Balladur's Prime Ministership (1993‚Äì95). Political offices held *Governmental functions **Prime minister: 1993‚Äì1995. **Minister of State, Minister of Economy and Finances: 1986‚Äì1988. *Electoral mandates *National Assembly of France **Member of the National Assembly of France for Paris: Elected in March 1986, but he became minister / 1988‚Äì1993 (Became Prime minister in 1993) / 1995‚Äì2007.

Reelected in 1995, 2001. Rwanda genocide On 5 August 2008, the government of Rwanda issued a report accusing Balladur of involvement in the 1994 Rwanda genocide that killed 800,000 people. He and other French officials were accused in the report of giving political, military, diplomatic, and logistical support during the genocide to Rwanda's extremist government and the Hutu forces that slaughtered minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.

Later, he was Vice President of the Convention on the Future of Europe that drafted the European Constitution and headed the Amato Group. He is commonly nicknamed dottor Sottile, (which means \\"Doctor Subtilis\\", the sobriquet of the Scottish Medieval philosopher John Duns Scotus, a reference to his political subtlety). From 2006 to 2008, he was the Minister of the Interior in Romano Prodi's government. On 12 September 2013, President Giorgio Napolitano appointed him to the Constitutional Court of Italy, where he has served since then. Biography Born in Turin into a Sicilian family, Amato grew up in Tuscany. He received a first degree in law from the University of Pisa in 1960, while attending the prestigious Collegio Medico-Giuridico of the Scuola Normale Superiore, which today is Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies, and a master's degree in comparative law from Columbia Law School in 1963. After teaching at the Universities of Modena, Perugia and Florence, he worked as professor of Italian and Comparative Constitutional Law at the University of Rome La Sapienza from 1975 to 1997. Amato began his political career in 1958, when he joined the Italian Socialist Party. He was a Member of Parliament from 1983 to 1993. He was Undersecretary of State to the Prime Minister's office from 1983 to 1987, Deputy Prime Minister from 1987 to 1988, and Minister for the Treasury from 1987 to 1989. From June 1992 to April 1993, Amato served as Prime Minister. During those ten months, a series of corruption scandals rocked Italy and swept away almost an entire class of political leaders. Amato himself was never implicated, notwithstanding how close he was to Bettino Craxi, a central figure in the corruption system. As Prime Minister, Amato responded effectively to two devaluations of the lira in the wake of currency speculation that led Italy to be expelled from the European Monetary System by cutting the budget deficit drastically, thus taking the first steps in the road that would bring Italy to adopt the Euro. At a point, his government was harshly contested because of a decree that suddenly moved the competence for corruption investigations into the hands of the police, which, being controlled directly by the government, would have not been independent. Fearing that the new system would have effectively blocked investigations on political corruption, Italians took to the streets in massive, spontaneous rallies. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro refused to sign the decree, deeming it blatantly unconstitutional. While his justice minister Giovanni Conso took the blame, it has been disputed whether Amato was a victim of circumstances or whether he really wanted to save the corruption-ridden system. At the end of his period as Prime Minister, Amato gave a speech to the Parliament in which he solemnly promised that at end of his term he would retire from politics, stressing that his was a true commitment and that he would not break this promise as some politicians (whom he characterized as \\"mandarins\\") used to do. However, this promise was short-lived; Amato has regularly come under criticism for having made such a solemn commitment and failing to keep it. Amato was President of the Italian antitrust authority from November 1994 to December 1997,Hawk B. Giuliano Amato, Antitrust and the Bounds of Power. Fordham International Law Journal [serial online]. 1998;21(4):1670-1675. Minister for Institutional Reforms in Massimo D'Alema's first government from October 1998 to May 1999, and, once again, Treasury Minister in D'Alema's second government from December 1999 to April 2000. Amato was nearly nominated for the Presidency of the Republic and was a close contender to replace Michel Camdessus as head of the International Monetary Fund. Amato served as Prime Minister again from April 2000 to May 2001. He promoted economic competitiveness as well as social protection. In addition to economic reforms, he pushed ahead with political and institutional reforms, trying to deal with a weak executive and fragmented legislature. In December 2001, European Union leaders at the European Council in Laeken appointed Amato and former Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene to be Vice Presidents of the Convention on the Future of Europe to assist former French President Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing in the drafting of the new European Constitution. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2002. Amato was a Member of the Senate representing the constituency of Grosseto in Tuscany from 2001 to 2006. In 2006, he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the Olive Tree list, and he was named Minister of the Interior in Romano Prodi's centre-left government. Since 2010, he also leads advanced seminar classes at the Master in International Public Affairs of the LUISS School of Government. Amato is married to Ms Diana Amato, a professor of Family Law at the University of Rome. They have two children, Elisa and Lorenzo, and five grandchildren, Giulia, Marco, Simone, Elena and Irene.

He was appointed as President of the Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies on 21 February 2012 by the Academic Senate of Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies and by a Decree of the Minister Francesco Profumo of the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (Italy). He resigned from his post at the Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies after being appointed to the Constitutional Court in September 2013.  Personal views  In 2011, Amato declared that Italian creativity is not supported by an adequate efficiency of the organization of its public and private entities. He believes it had a role in the lost hope in the future and in the sense of a common national identity, as well as it hadn't been yet perfectioned as whole in a way that was congruent with its essence. That loss had favoured the flourishing of xenophoby and purported regional identities (e.g. the Lega Nord movement). He think the Brigandage after 1861 in Southern Italy was an unfair and unlawful movement that can't be seen as form of antinational rebellion. However, the soldiers and the officials of the Borbonic Army who joined the movement can't be defined as betrayers of the ongoing Italy. It is also not credible the Expedition of the Thousand could have caused the annexation of the Southern Italy to the Kingdom of Sardinia by itself, while the main political and cultural foundations had been thrown by the works of intellectuals like Francesco Mario Pagano and Vincenzo Cuoco produced in the ninth decade of the XVIII century. If he didn't believe the national identity is always something of more important than sub- national or sovra-national ones, he believes in the multi-layer identities model proposed by Alberto Banti, in a way for which the European identity strengthens the Italian identity even when they live and work in a foreign country. According to him, the Italian identity is kept alive in any country in which they should have gone.

Ya'alon now serves as the number two on the Yesh Atid-Telem list that was created following the 2020 Israeli legislative election. Early life Ya'alon was born Moshe Smilansky, the son of David Smilansky and Batya Silber. His father, a factory worker, had moved to Mandatory Palestine with his parents from Ukraine in 1925, and was a veteran of the Haganah and Jewish Brigade. His mother was a Holocaust survivor who had fought against the Nazis with partisans during World War II. She came to Palestine in 1946. Ya'alon grew up in Kiryat Haim, a working-class suburb of Haifa. He was active in the Labor Zionist youth movement \\"HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed\\" and joined a Nahal group named Ya'alon, a name he later adopted.Ya'alon is widely known by his nickname, \\"Boogie\\" (also sometimes spelled \\"Bogie\\" or \\"Bogey\\" in English) He later moved to kibbutz Grofit, in the Arava region near Eilat. In 1968, he was conscripted into the Israel Defense Forces, and volunteered as a paratrooper in the Paratroopers Brigade. He served as a soldier and a squad leader in the Brigade's 50 battalion and fought in the War of Attrition. He was discharged in 1971.Gal Perl Finkel, It's the man (or woman) who makes the job, The Jerusalem Post, 19 November 2018. Military career In 1973, Ya'alon was called up as a reservist during the Yom Kippur War. On 15 October 1973, his unit, the 55th Paratroopers Brigade, became the first IDF unit to cross the Suez Canal into Egypt. He continued fighting as part of the Israeli drive into the Egyptian mainland, and participated in the encirclement of the Egyptian Third Army. Following the war, he rejoined the IDF as a career soldier, and became an infantry officer after completing Officer Candidate School. He then returned to the Paratroopers Brigade as a platoon leader. Later on he served as a company commander in the Brigade's 50 battalion and led the Brigade's Reconnaissance company in several special operations and during Operation Litani. During the 1982 Lebanon War, Ya'alon joined the Sayeret Matkal commando unit as a commander. He then rejoined the Paratroopers Brigade and was appointed as the commander of its 890 \\"Efe\\" (Echis) paratroop battalion. During this time, he was wounded in the leg while leading a pursuit of Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon. Ya'alon took a sabbatical to the United Kingdom to study at the British Army's Camberley Staff College. Upon his return to Israel, he was promoted to the rank of Colonel and appointed commander of Sayeret Matkal. Ya'alon led it to many notable achievements, for which the unit received four recommendations of honor. After his tenure as commander was finished, Ya'alon studied at the University of Haifa, obtaining a BA in Political Science, and took an Armored Corps course. In 1990, Ya'alon was appointed commander of the Paratroopers Brigade, and two years later, became commander of the Judea and Samaria Division. On 10 December 1992, Ya'alon killed a militant from the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine with a hand grenade after the militant had shot dead a Yamam operative attempting to arrest him.Moshe (Bogie) Ya'alon, A long way shor. Yediot Books (2008), pp.227‚Äì228. In 1993, he was appointed commander of an IDF training base, and commander of an armored division. In 1995, Ya'alon was promoted to Major General and appointed head of Military Intelligence. In 1998, he was appointed commanding officer of Israel's Central Command. He was serving in this position when the Second Intifada was launched in September 2000. Ya'alon was appointed Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on 9 July 2002, and served in that position until 1 June 2005. The major focus throughout his tenure as Chief of Staff was the army's effort to quell the Second Intifada. Under his watch, the IDF conducted Operation Defensive Shield. In February 2005, Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz decided not to extend Ya'alon's service as Chief of Staff for another year. This marked the climax of tensions between Mofaz and Ya'alon, which had arisen partly through Ya'alon's objection to the Gaza disengagement plan. On 1 June 2005, Ya'alon retired from the army, and Dan Halutz, his successor as Chief of Staff, oversaw the disengagement. In December 2005, relatives of the victims of the 1996 shelling of Qana filed a suit against Ya'alon in Washington, D.C., for his alleged role in their deaths.Lawsuit filed against Ya'alon in US court The Jerusalem Post In late 2006, while Ya'alon was in New Zealand on a private fund-raising trip for the Jewish National Fund, Auckland District Court judge Avinash Deobhakta issued a warrant for his arrest for alleged war crimes arising from his role in the 2002 assassination of Hamas commander Salah Shehade, who was killed in a targeted assassination, when an Israeli warplane bombed his home in Gaza City. About 14 Palestinian civilians were also killed in the airstrike. Deobhakta stated that New Zealand had an obligation to prosecute him under the Geneva Convention. Attorney-General Michael Cullen ordered a stay in the warrant after advice from the Crown Law office that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute, and the warrant was cancelled after Ya'alon left New Zealand. He was appointed Minister of Defense on 17 March 2013. He resigned on 20 May 2016, citing \\"difficult disagreements on moral and professional matters\\" with prime minister Netanyahu and warning that \\"extreme and dangerous elements have taken over Israel and the Likud Party\\". Think tanks and institutes After leaving his position as Chief of Staff, Ya'alon spent time in the think tank Washington Institute for Near East Policy and became a Senior Fellow at the Adelson Institute for Strategic Studies at the Shalem Center Institute for International and Middle East Studies. Ya'alon also served as the chairman of the Center for Jewish Identity and Culture at Beit Morasha in Jerusalem. Political career Ya'alon with Rob Nicholson, Canadian Minister of National Defence, and Chuck Hagel, US Secretary of Defense, at the Halifax International Security Forum 2013 Ya'alon meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, 2015 Israeli Minister of Defense Moshe Ya'alon speaks after meeting Ash Carter, 2015 Ya'alon backed the Oslo Accords, but later he \\"admitted his mistake.\\" On 17 November 2008, Ya'alon announced that he was joining Likud and that he would participate in the primaries which would determine the Likud candidates for the 2009 elections. He won eighth place on the party's list, and entered the Knesset as Likud won 27 seats. Upon the formation of the Netanyahu government, he was appointed Vice Prime Minister (alongside Silvan Shalom) and Minister of Strategic Affairs. In March 2013, he replaced Ehud Barak as Defense Minister. As Defense Minister Ya'alon decided to continue to manufacture and purchase Merkava tanks for the IDF, after the whole project was in question due to budget issues and the overall discussion of the necessity of tanks in modern battlefields. During Ya'alon's tenure, foreign sources claimed that the Israeli Air Force launched several airstrikes on advanced weapons deposits in Syria before they were transferred to Hezbollah. In January 2015, the leader of Lehava anti-assimilation group, Ben- Zion Gopstein, voiced harsh criticism against Ya'alon after Channel 2 reported that he was expected to categorize Lehava as a terrorist organization. Ya'alon ordered the Shin Bet and the Defense Ministry to assemble evidence required for the classification. Lehava promotes the ideology of the late Jewish Defense League leader Meir Kahane. Three members of Lehava were arrested and indicted in 2014 for committing arson and spray-painting anti-Arab graffiti at the Max Rayne Hand in Hand (Yad B'Yad) Bilingual School in Jerusalem and Lehava's leader Ben Zion Gopstein along with other group members were arrested shortly thereafter for incitement.\\"Report: Ya'alon moves to name anti- assimilation group Lehava a terrorist organization\\" (4 Jan 2015) The Jerusalem Post The arson incident received international attention.The White House \\"A Real Festival of Lights: Hanukkah at the White House 2014/5775\\" Gopstein said \\"I suggest that [Ya'alon] aim to outlaw the Islamist Movement and then preoccupy itself with an anti-assimilation group... Instead of taking care of an enemy of Israel, the defense minister is trying to win over votes from the Left [by] taking on Lehava. The group acts to save the daughters of Israel [Jewish women] and deserves the Israel Prize.\\"Anti-assimilation group could be classified as terrorist, Times of Israel 4 January 2015 In February 2015 Ya'alon took a political stand on gay marriage. In a speech he promised to help promote LGBT rights in Israel, and in particular noted he will support the establishment of civil marriage laws in Israel that would allow same-sex couples to be recognized as a family unit.\\"Ya'alon backs same-sex marriage in Israel\\" Times of Israel, 7 February 2015 Following the 2016 shooting by an Israeli soldier of a wounded Palestinian assailant, Ya'alon said that the soldier's action \\"completely contradicts IDF values and its battle ethics; even in a moment of great anger we must not permit such unbridled and uncontrolled behavior.\\" https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/world/middleeast/video-shows-israel- soldier-shooting-palestinian.html This statement was viewed by many Israelis as prejudging the case.https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/21/world/middleeast/moshe-yaalon-israeli- defense-minister-resigns.html Ya'alon formed Telem on 2 January 2019. On January 29, 2019, Ya'alon announced a political alliance with former IDF chief of staff Benny Gantz. Ya'alon was in the number two position on Gantz's Israel Resilience Party list. Ya'alon reiterated his opposition to a \\"two states for two peoples\\" solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. On 21 February 2019, the Israel Resilience Party and Telem merged with Yesh Atid. Ya'alon became the number three candidate on the united list, known as the \\"Blue and White\\" party. Following the party's split after the 2020 Israeli legislative election, Ya'alon's party aligned with Yair Lapid to form the Yesh Atid-Telem alliance and became second in the list. Controversial statements=Palestinian threat as 'cancer' On 27 August 2002, he told the Haaretz newspaper: \\"The Palestinian threat harbors cancer-like attributes that have to be severed. There are all kinds of solutions to cancer. Some say it's necessary to amputate organs but at the moment I am applying chemotherapy.\\"The enemy within, Ha'aretz, 29 August 2002 In January 2004, he publicly stated that the thirteen Sayeret Matkal soldiers who refused to serve in the Israeli- occupied territories were taking the unit's name in vain. On the need to confront Iran In January 2008, during a discussion at IDC Herzliya, Ya'alon said \\"There is no way to stabilize the situation all over the world and especially in the Middle East without confronting Iran.\\"Interview with Former IDF Chief-of-Staff Moshe Yaalon , The College Zionist According to The Sydney Morning Herald Ya'alon said: \\"We have to confront the Iranian revolution immediately. There is no way to stabilize the Middle East today without defeating the Iranian [government]. The Iranian nuclear program must be stopped.\\" When asked whether \\"all options\\" included a military deposition of Ahmadinejad and the rest of Iran's current leadership, Ya'alon told The Herald: \\"We have to consider killing him. All options must be considered.\\"Israeli hawks ready to fly on Iran, The Sydney Morning Herald 24 November 2008 The Peace Now/'virus' incident In August 2009, Ya'alon visited the ruins of Homesh, a settlement that was destroyed in Israeli disengagement from Gaza in 2005 and toured Israeli settlements in the north of the West Bank, considered as un-authorized outposts. He said that these communities are all legitimate and should not be called \\"illegal.\\"FR.jpost.com In addition, he participated in a convention of Manhigut Yehudit (\\"Jewish Leadership\\"), the more right-wing Settlers' segment within the Likud right- wing Party, in which he condemned the disengagement plan, called Peace Now a \\"virus\\"Ro\`i Sharon, \\"◊ô◊¢◊ú◊ï◊ü: ◊ô◊î◊ï◊ì◊ô◊ù ◊¶◊®◊ô◊õ◊ô◊ù ◊ú◊î◊™◊ô◊ô◊©◊ë ◊ë◊õ◊ú ◊û◊ß◊ï◊ù ◊ë◊ê◊®◊• ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú\\", Maariv, 19 August 2009. and said that \\"We become accustomed to Arabs being permitted to live everywhere, in the Negev, Galilee, Nablus, Jenin, and [on the other hand] there are areas where Jews are not allowed to live. We caused this.\\" He also stated that, \\"regarding the issue of the settlements, in my opinion Jews can and should live everywhere in the Land of Israel. Now, ... first of all, every settlement needs to get the approval of the authorities, and what goes up on the spot, in contradiction to these decisions and so on is not legitimate. It's against the law\\". Later, after meeting with PM Netanyahu, Ya'alon retracted parts of his statements and said that he \\"recognized the importance of democratic discourse and respecting other opinions.\\" Ya'alon explained that, indeed, all Israelis want peace, now. He stressed, however, the need to accept the fact that peace will not come immediately, otherwise it \\"hurts Israel.\\" Ya'alon stated that, in his view, the way of thinking that Israel just needs to give one more piece of land and then it will have peace is a kind of \\"virus.\\" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and U.S. engagement in the peace process In January 2014, Ya'alon was quoted in an Israeli newspaper calling U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry \\"obsessive\\" and \\"messianic,\\" and claiming that the \\"only thing that can save us is if Kerry wins the Nobel Prize and leaves us alone.\\" The remarks attributed to him precipitated a diplomatic row with the U.S. State Department and elicited criticism of members of Israel's government. In October 2014 during a visit to the U.S. Ya'alon met with his counterpart, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, but was denied requests to meet with Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry. A U.S. official told the Jerusalem Post that the snub should come as no surprise. Segregation of buses In October 2014, Ya'alon supported a plan that would effectively ban Palestinian workers from buses used by Jewish settlers. Ya'alon said that his plan was based on security needs. The IDF said that there was no security issue with integrated buses given that all West Bank Palestinian workers go through security checkpoints. When Ya'alon's move was criticized as being a form of apartheid, Yehuda Weinstein, Israel's Attorney General, demanded that Ya'alon explain his rationale. Resuming settlement construction once Obama is gone In late 2014 at a meeting with Jewish settlers on the West Bank who questioned Israel's apparent delay in settler construction, Ya'alon said that settlement construction represented the greatest growth in Israel and with regard to any apparent slowdown, he declared, \\"It's temporary. There is a certain administration now in the United States, which is leading this policy. This administration will not stay forever and I hope it's temporary.\\" He commented that it is important for Israel not to antagonize the U.S. at the moment, because American support is needed in countering diplomatic undertakings at the U.N. that he claimed were \\"anti-Israel.\\" \\"The publication of construction plans, even in Jerusalem, draws a response from various bodies, including our friends, that attack us,\\" he said. But he noted that he very much wanted to approve construction plans.\\"Ya'alon: Obama administration 'won't be around forever'\\" (10 December 2014) YNET\\"http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4601834,00.html Ya'alon's remarks about not antagonizing the U.S. came at a time when an opinion poll showed that the \\"overwhelming majority\\" of Israelis believe their country's relationship with the U.S. has been hurt as a result of the poor relationship between Obama and Netanyahu.\\"'Poll: Most say poor Netanyahu - Obama ties are harmful' (Dec.10, 2014) The Jerusalem Post\\" http://www.jpost.com/Diplomatic- Conference/Poll-Most-say-poor-Netanyahu-Obama-ties-are-harmful-384189\\"Winer, Stuart 'Ya'alon: After Obama, a West Bank construction boom: In closed-door meeting, defense minister says settlements already the fastest-growing towns in Israel, despite US protests' (Dec 10, 2014) The Times of Israel\\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/yaalon-after-obama-a-west-bank- construction-boom/ In response to the Ya'alon's remarks, which were broadcast of Israeli Army Radio, a spokesperson for Ya'alon claimed, \\"this does not diminish in any way the appreciation and esteem Minister Ya'alon has for the contribution of the U.S. and its government to the security of Israel and the fact that the U.S. is Israel's best friend and strategic anchor.\\"Cesana, Shlomo 'In final 2 years, Obama to seek Israeli-Palestinian peace' (10 December 2014) Israel Hayom http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=22037 Responding to the latest of Ya'alon negative comments about the Obama administration, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, \\"This administration's opposition to settlements is fully consistent with the policies of administrations for decades, including of both parties.

She served as the Member of Parliament for Watford from 1997 to 2010, and was a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Ministry of Justice from 2009‚Äì10. Early life and career Ward was born in North Shields, Northumberland, the daughter of Frank and Cathy Ward. Both her parents were Labour Party councillors and her father stood unsuccessfully as the Labour candidate for Hertsmere at the 1987 general election. She was brought up in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, where she attended the Loreto College, an all- girls Roman Catholic school in St Albans, and studied at the newly created University of Hertfordshire graduating with a LLB (Law degree) in 1993. She then completed an MA in Britain and the European Union at Brunel University, before qualifying as a solicitor at the College of Law in London. From 1995‚Äì98, she was a trainee solicitor. Ward joined the Labour Party, the Co- operative Party and the Transport and General Workers' Union at the age of fifteen, becoming an active member of Young Labour. In 1990, she won the South East TUC Mike Perkins Memorial Award for Young Trade Unionists before being elected as the Youth Representative on Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) the following year. She was elected as a Councillor on Elstree and Borehamwood Town Council in 1994, where she served as Mayor from 1996‚Äì97. She stepped down from the Labour Party NEC in 1995 upon her selection as the party's candidate for Watford. Parliamentary career Ward became the MP for Watford at the 1997 general election, succeeding the former Conservative Party Deputy Chief Whip Tristan Garel-Jones who had retired, and defeating Conservative candidate Robert Gordon by 5,792 votes. Elected at the age of 24, she was not quite the youngest MP, being 50 days older than Chris Leslie, the new MP for Shipley. After her election, Ward became a member of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee. From 2000 to 2002, she was the Chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Chocolate and Confectionery Industry Group. In the 2001 general election she retained her seat by 5,555 votes and was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary to John Hutton. The increasing dominance of local politics in Watford Borough council by the Liberal Democrats, including the election of a Liberal Democrat Mayor, led to speculation that Ward would find re-election extremely difficult. Ward even accused staff from the council of harassment during the 2005 general election campaign. However, she managed to hold off a strong Liberal Democrat challenge from Sal Brinton; despite a 12% swing against her, Ward held the seat with a majority of 1,148 votes, approximately 2.3% of the electorate. The Conservative candidate was narrowly forced into third place with 793 fewer votes than Brinton, making Watford a three way marginal seat. Upon her re-election in May 2005, Ward was appointed an Assistant Government Whip before being promoted to full Whip, as a Lord Commissioner of HM Treasury, on 5 May 2006. She was promoted again in October 2008 to Vice-Chamberlain of the Household, the lowest of the senior Whips. At the June 2009 Cabinet reshuffle, she replaced Shahid Malik as the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Justice. She claimed over ¬£90,000 in second home allowance between 2004 and 2009, despite living less than 30 miles from Westminster. Upon publication of MP's expenses in 2009, Ward defended her choice to fund a second home in Westminster from her parliamentary allowance, citing her need to balance her public duties with her duties as a mother of small children. Ward was one of 98 MPs who voted in favour of legislation which would have kept MPs expense details secret. She lost her seat at the 2010 general election when she finished third in the election in Watford with 14,750 votes, behind the Conservative Party candidate Richard Harrington (19,291 votes) and the Liberal Democrat Sal Brinton (17,866 votes). Voting record The Labour Party was in Government throughout Ward's time in Parliament. As of the end of 2009, Ward has rebelled against the Government's stated or majority position 19 times out of 2,629 votes she has attended, a rebelling rate of 0.72%. She has on occasion voted against her party line on changes to the schedule of the House of Commons, and the Government's position on reform of the House of Lords. In 2004, she voted with the Conservatives in favour of introducing a ban on the \\"reasonable chastisement\\" of children. In 2008, on a free vote, Ward voted against her party's majority position on abortion, where she unsuccessfully voted in several separate bills for a reduction in the time when an abortion can be carried out from 24 weeks. Post-parliamentary career From June 2011 until its closure in March 2015, Ward was executive director of the Independent Pharmacy Federation. In April 2015, Ward became the Chair of Pharmacy Voice, an association of trade bodies representing community pharmacy contractors. She resigned this role in April 2017 as part of the Pharmacy Voice's closure. Claire Ward is Chief Executive of the Institute for Collaborative Working since January 2019. She also continues roles in the pharmacy sector with the Pharmacists Defence Association and as Chair of Sigma Pharmaceuticals Annual Conference. She is Governor of the University of Hertfordshire since September 2018. A Non Executive Director of Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust since May 2013.

In January 2019 his adopted son, Stephen Waterson, was put on trial accused of manslaughter by crushing his girlfriend's son with his car seat. He was also accused of intimidating the driver of the car. His girlfriend was found guilty of child cruelty in May 2019, and sentenced to two and a half years in prison, but the jury failed to reach a verdict on Stephen Waterson.

Alan- Whitehead.org, 24 May 2004 He lobbied for changes to the Government's Education White Paper. He does not support building new nuclear power stations, believing that nuclear is uneconomic. He voted in favour of ID cards and for a ban on fox hunting. He supported Owen Smith in the 2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election. Renewable energy politics Whitehead has lobbied for the increased use of sustainable energy sources, particularly microgeneration. He criticised the results of the Energy Review, Alan- Whitehead.org, 13 July 2006 and was the co-author of EDM 2204 which states 'the case for nuclear has not yet been made' and urges the government to 'recognise the enormous potential for reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by energy efficiency and conservation, greater use of combined heat and power, and rapid investment in the full range of renewable technologies, including microgeneration.' As leader of Southampton City Council in 1986, Whitehead proposed that the city council take measures to become a 'self sustaining city' with regard to energy generation. Alan- Whitehead.org, 24 May 2006 One such measure was the conversion of Southampton Civic Centre to being heated by local reservoirs of geothermal energy. Whitehead sits as a non-executive director of a non-profit making company called SSEL Ltd, formed to deliver a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) project, which was partially funded by the Government as part of the regeneration of outer Shirley. Southampton City Council, 25 September 2006 The CHP system recycles the by-product 'low grade heat' made during the electricity generation process and uses the by-product to heat water which is piped to local homes. This scheme has been criticised by the current Cabinet Member with Responsibility for Environment & Transport, Matthew Dean, for being unviable and the Council's involvement in the project has now ended. Whitehead's Private Members Bill, was 'talked out' by Conservative backbenchers in 2005, but many of the Bill's most important aspects were incorporated into the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006, sponsored by Mark Lazarowicz MP. Whitehead's amendments to the bill included: * requiring better compliance of building regulations for energy efficiency * the removal of planning permission for microgeneration in homes * new regulations to ensure a minimum energy standard in new homes including microgeneration Whitehead is an outspoken supporter of action on anthropogenic climate change, and has called debate by members of parliament who reject the scientific view a \\"flat earth love-in\\". Houses in multiple occupancy Due to the high concentration of houses in multiple occupation in Southampton, in 2007 Whitehead proposed changing planning regulations which would mean a landlord would be required to apply for planning permission if they wanted to convert a family home into an HMO housing more than four people. Alan- Whitehead.org, 22 May 2007 The proposal was considered as part of the government's current review of the private housing sector, to report in October 2008. Communities and Local Government, 9 April 2008 Pre-pay meters Alan Whitehead is currently campaigning with the National Housing Federation to end the current pricing practice used by several energy companies which sees customers who pay for their electricity or gas via pre- pay meters pay more for the same amount of energy than customers who pay via direct debit. Whitehead argues: \\"Ten per cent of pre-pay electricity customers are in fuel poverty compared with only 3.5 per cent of direct debit customers. In short, those who need affordable energy most pay far more for it than those who do not. What is worse, because of the nature of pre-payment, most of them are not aware of that fact.\\" Education Bill 2006 Along with fellow Labour MPs Estelle Morris, John Denham and Martin Salter, Whitehead co-wrote the so- called alternative education white paper 'Shaping the Education Bill- Reaching for Consensus,' which criticised the weakening of the role of local education authorities in the provision of education services and called for the schools admissions code to be made mandatory. He voted for the Bill when Alan Johnson, the new Education Secretary, accepted many of the alternative white paper's proposals. Rebellions Whitehead has rebelled against a government 3-line whip on the following issues: * The renewal of the UK Trident programme * The invasion of Iraq Whitehead's rebellion against a government 3-line whip on Trident renewal is not surprising, given that archived documents have emerged showing that in 1982‚Äì83 Whitehead paid a subscription to Southampton CND. World Cup 2006 In June 2006, the UK Parliamentary Football Team ran a charity match in Portugal against the Portuguese Parliament, which coincided with part of the World Cup. The match and the trip were sponsored by McDonald's as part of their Football in the Community Programme. The UKPFC was criticised for accepting McDonald's sponsorship by the BMA. Whitehead, who at the time played in goal for the UKPFC, fully declared the sponsorship in his register of members interests. He also pointed out the trip was part of a long-standing fundraising campaign between the UKPFC and McDonald's that raised over 20,000 euros for local charities. In Southampton Whitehead is a Fellow of the Institute of Waste Management, and member of the Board for The Environment Centre (Southampton) and Third Age Centre (Southampton).

He was a member of parliament (MP) from 1992, first for Croydon North West and then for Croydon North, until his death in 2012. Early life and education Wicks was born in Hatfield, Hertfordshire to Arthur Wicks, a Labour member of the London County Council and later Greater London Council. He was educated at the independent Elizabeth College, Guernsey; North West London Polytechnic and the London School of Economics gaining a BSc in Sociology. Early career From 1968 to 1970, he was a research fellow of the Department of Social Administration at the University of York, then a research worker at the Centre for Environmental Studies from 1970 to 1972. Wicks worked in the Urban Deprivation Unit (abolished in 1978) of the Home Office as a social policy analyst from 1974 to 1977, and was a lecturer in Social Administration at Brunel University from 1970 to 1974. From 1977 to 1978, he was a lecturer in Social Policy at the Civil Service College (now called the National School of Government) in Ascot, then research director and secretary of the Study Commission on the Family from 1978 to 1983. He was later Director of the Family Policy Studies Centre from 1983 to 1992. He was the author and co- author of many publications, including Old and Cold: hypothermia and social policy and A Future for All: Do we need the Welfare State? His keen concern about fuel poverty led to him to act as a Trustee of the National Energy Foundation (1988‚Äì94). He was involved in politics in Croydon, chairing his local Constituency Labour Party and standing for election to Croydon Council before his election to Parliament. It was only revealed in his posthumous memoirs that in 1976 Wicks had leaked Cabinet papers to Frank Field at the Child Poverty Action Group. This action proved decisive in preventing the Callaghan government from introducing means testing of child benefit. Parliamentary career He was first elected in 1992 for Croydon North West after having previously contested the seat unsuccessfully in 1987. Wicks was one of the few MPs whose Private Member's Bill reached the statute books, with the Carers (Recognition and Services) Act 1995 recognising the needs of family carers. He was Chairman of the Education Select Committee from 1998 until his July 1999 appointment as Minister for Lifelong Learning in the Department for Education and Employment. In July 2001 he moved to the Department for Work and Pensions, where he spent four years, first as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, and then as Minister of State, for Pensions. In May 2005, he was appointed as Minister for Energy at the Department of Trade and Industry in the post-election Cabinet reshuffle. In a mini-reshuffle on 10 November 2006, following the retirement of Lord Sainsbury, Wicks was appointed as Minister of State for Science and Innovation in the same department. In Gordon Brown's first reshuffle on 28 June 2007, Wicks was moved to the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, which replaced the Department of Trade and Industry, to resume his old role as Minister for Energy. It is reported that Wicks was intended to serve in the cabinet, but the post-it note bearing his name and position fell onto the floor.

He was the inventor of a precision boring machine that could bore cast iron cylinders, such as cannon barrels NAM Rodger 'The Command Of The Ocean' Penguin 2004, p.377 and piston cylinders used in the steam engines of James Watt. His boring machine has been called the first machine tool. He also developed a blowing device for blast furnaces that allowed higher temperatures, increasing their efficiency, and helped sponsor the first iron bridge in Coalbrookdale. He is notable for his method of cannon boring, his techniques at casting iron, and his work with the government of France to establish a cannon foundry.Chaloner, 1951. Biography=Early life John Wilkinson was born in Little Clifton, Bridgefoot, Cumberland (now part of Cumbria), the eldest son of Isaac Wilkinson and Mary Johnson. Isaac was then the potfounder at the blast furnace there,W. H. Chaloner, 'Isaac Wilkinson, potfounder' in L. S. Pressnell (ed.), Studies in the industrial revolution presented to T.S. Ashton (Athlone Press, Univ. of London 1960), 23‚Äì51. one of the first to use coke instead of charcoal, which was pioneered by Abraham Darby. John and his half-brother William, who was 17 years younger, were raised in a non-conformist Presbyterian family and he was educated at a dissenting academy at Kendal, run by Dr Caleb Rotherham.Harris J R His sister Mary married another non- conformist, Joseph Priestley in 1762. Priestley also played a role in educating John's younger brother, William. In 1745, when John was 17, he was apprenticed to a Liverpool merchant for five years and then entered into partnership with his father. When his father moved to Bersham furnace near Wrexham in 1753 John remained at Kirkby Lonsdale in Westmorland where he married Ann Maudesley on 12 June 1755. Iron master From 1755 John Wilkinson became a partner in the Bersham concern and in 1757 with partners, he erected a blast furnace at Willey, near Broseley in Shropshire.B. Trinder, The Industrial Revolution in Shropshire (2000), 42. Later he built another furnace and works at New Willey. He made his home in Broseley in a house called 'The Lawns' which became his headquarters for many years. He had houses either side of 'The Lawns' which served for administration, one being named 'The Mint' used for distribution of the thousands of tokens, each valued equivalent to a halfpenny. In East Shropshire he also developed iron works at Snedshill, Hollinswood, Hadley and Hampton Loade. He and Edward Blakeway also leased land to build another at Bradley works in Bilston parish, near Wolverhampton.Herefordshire Record Office, E12/S/378, 20 October 1784. He became known as the Father of the extensive South Staffordshire iron industry with Bilston as the start of the Black Country. In 1761, he took over Bersham Ironworks as well. Bradley became his largest and most successful enterprise, and was the site of extensive experiments in getting raw coal to substitute for coke in the production of cast iron. At its peak, it included a number of blast furnaces, a brick works, potteries, glass works, and rolling mills. The Birmingham Canal was subsequently built near the Bradley works. Inventions Wilkinson was a prolific inventor of new products and processes, and especially anything connected with novel uses of cast iron and wrought iron. His development of a machine tool for boring cast iron cannons presaged the accurate boring of cylinders for the first Watt steam engines. He also improved the air supply for the blast furnace using a new design of bellows, and was the first to use wrought iron in canal barges. He supported the construction of the first important cast iron bridge at Coalbrookdale. Cannon boring machine Iron cannons at Youghal, County Cork, Ireland Bersham became well known for high-quality casting and a producer of guns and cannon. Historically cannons had been cast with a core and then bored to remove imperfections, but in 1774 Wilkinson patented a technique for boring iron guns from a solid piece, rotating the gun barrel rather than the boring- bar. This technique made the guns more accurate since the bore was uniform in diameter, and less likely to explode. While bronze cannon were already being bored from the solid, the boring of large iron naval cannon was novel. The patent was quashed in 1779 (the navy saw it as a monopoly and sought to overthrow it) but Wilkinson still remained a major manufacturer. In 1792 Wilkinson bought the Brymbo Hall estate in Denbighshire, not far from Bersham, where furnaces and other plant were installed. After his death and the decline of his industrial empire, the ironworks lay idle for some years until in 1842.Brymbo Steelworks ‚Äì the Scottish connection, Wrexham County Borough Council It became once again an important works and eventually became Brymbo Steelworks, which continued to operate until 1990.Brymbo Steelworks ‚Äì The last tap, Wrexham County Borough Council Boring machine for steam engines Steam engine by James Watt (1797) James Watt had tried unsuccessfully for several years to obtain accurately bored cylinders for his steam engines, and was forced to use hammered iron, which was out of round and caused leakage past the piston. In 1774 John Wilkinson invented a boring machine in which the shaft that held the cutting tool extended through the cylinder and was supported on both ends, unlike the cantilevered borers then in use. With this machine he was able to bore the cylinder for Boulton & Watt's first commercial engine, and was given an exclusive contract for the provision of cylinders owing to the lower tolerance between the piston and cylinder and the resulting improvement in efficiency by lowering steam losses through the gap.. Reprinted by McGraw-Hill, New York and London, 1926 (); and by Lindsay Publications, Inc., Bradley, Illinois, (). Until this era, advancements in drilling and boring practice had lain only within the application field of gun barrels for firearms and cannon; Wilkinson's achievement was a milestone in the gradual development of boring technology, as its fields of application broadened into engines, pumps, and other industrial uses. While the main market for steam engines had been for pumping water out of mines, he saw much more use for them in the driving of machinery in ironworks such as blowing engines, forge hammers and rolling mills, the first rotary engine being installed at Bradley in 1783. Among his many inventions was a reversing rolling mill with two steam cylinders that made the process much more economical. John Wilkinson took a key interest in obtaining orders for these more efficient steam engines and other uses for cast iron from the owners of Cornish copper mines. As part of this interest he bought shares in eight of the mines to help provide capital. Hydraulic blowing engine In 1757 Wilkinson patented a hydraulic powered blowing engine to increase the air blast through the tuyeres for blast furnaces, so improving the rate of production of cast iron. The historian Joseph Needham likened Wilkinson's design to the one described in 1313 by the Chinese Imperial Government metallurgist Wang Zhen in his Treatise on Agriculture. Iron Bridge The Iron Bridge spanning the River Severn in Shropshire In 1775 John Wilkinson was the prime mover initiating the building of the Iron Bridge connecting the then-important industrial town of Broseley with the other side of the River Severn. His friend Thomas Farnolls Pritchard, had written to him with plans for the bridge. A committee of subscribers was formed, mostly including Broseley businessmen, to agree to the use of iron rather than wood or stone and obtain price quotations and an authorising act of Parliament. Wilkinson's persuasion and drive held together the group support through several problems during the parliamentary process. Had Wilkinson not succeeded in this and also drawn support from influential parliamentarians, the bridge might not have been built or might have been made of other materials. Consequently, the name 'Ironbridge' would not have been coined for the district in Madeley; the area would not have attained the status of a World Heritage Site. Abraham Darby III was chosen as the preferred builder after quoting to build the bridge for ¬£3,150/-/-. When construction started, Wilkinson sold his shares to Abraham Darby III in 1777, leaving the latter to steer the project to its successful conclusion in 1779 and be opened in 1781. In 1787 he launched the first wrought iron, barge, constructed in Broseley. It was a development which would become common over the years ahead and in large ships in the following century. He patented several other inventions. Copper interests Parys Mountain opencast copper mine John Wilkinson made his fortune selling good quality goods made of iron and reached his limit of investment expansion. His expertise proved useful when he invested in many copper interests. In 1761 the Royal Navy clad the hull of the frigate with copper sheet to reduce the growth of marine biofouling and prevent attack by the Teredo shipworm. The drag from the hull growth cut the speed and the shipworm caused severe hull damage, especially in tropical waters. After the success of this work the Navy decreed that all ships should be clad and this created a large demand for copper that Wilkinson noted during his visits to shipyards. He bought shares in eight Cornish copper mines and met Thomas Williams, the 'Copper King' of the Parys Mountain mines in Anglesey. Besides supplying Williams with large quantities of plate and equipment, Wilkinson also supplied scrap for the process of recovery of copper from solution by cementation. Wilkinson bought a 1/16th share in the Mona Mine at Parys Mountain and shares in Williams industries at Holywell, Flintshire, St Helens, near Liverpool and Swansea, South Wales. Wilkinson and Williams worked together on several projects. They were amongst the first to issue trade tokens ('Willys' and 'Druids') to alleviate the shortage of small coins. Jointly they set up the Cornish Metal Company in 1785 as a marketing company for copper. Its aim was to ensure both a good return for the Cornish miners and a stable price for the users of copper. Warehouses were set up in Birmingham, London, Bristol and Liverpool. To help his business interests and to service his trade tokens, Wilkinson bought into partnerships with banks in Birmingham, Bilston, Bradley, Brymbo and Shrewsbury. Lead mines and works Wilkinson bought lead mines at Minera in Wrexham, five miles from Bersham, Llyn Pandy at Soughton (now Sychdyn) and Mold, also in Flintshire. He installed steam pumping engines to make them viable again. His lead was exported through the port of Chester. To use some of the lead produced, Wilkinson had a lead pipe works at Rotherhithe, London. This factory lasted for many years eventually making the solder filler alloys used in the car factory at Dagenham. Philanthropy Joseph Priestley, by Rembrandt Peale (c. 1801) Wilkinson had a good reputation as an employer. Wherever new works were established, cottages were built to accommodate employees and their families. He gave significant financial support to his brother-in-law, the famous chemist Dr Joseph Priestley. He became a church warden in Broseley and was later elected High Sheriff of Denbighshire. In schools that had no slates he was able to provide iron troughs to hold sand for the practice of writing and arithmetic. He provided a cast-iron pulpit for the church at Bilston. Family life, and death halfpenny token struck by Matthew Boulton's Soho Mint John married Ann Maudsley in 1759. Her family was wealthy and her dowry helped to pay for a share in the New Willey Company. After the death of Ann, his second marriage, when he was 35, was to Mary Lee, whose money helped him to buy out his partners. When he was in his seventies, his mistress Mary Ann Lewis, a maid at his estate in Brymbo Hall, gave birth to his only children, a boy and two girls. By 1796, when he was 68, he was producing about one-eighth of Britain's cast iron.Soldon, p. 67 He became \\"a titan\\" ‚Äì very wealthy, and somewhat eccentric. His \\"iron madness\\" reached a peak in the 1790s, when he had almost everything around him made of iron, even several coffins and a massive obelisk to mark his grave, which still stands in the village of Lindale-in-Cartmel, now in Cumbria. He was appointed Sheriff of Denbighshire for 1799. He died on 14 July 1808 at his works in Bradley, probably from diabetes. He was originally buried at his Castlehead estate at Lindale. He left a very large estate in his will (more than ¬£130,000 - equivalent to ¬£ in ), to which he intended to make his three children the principal heirs, with executors to manage the estate for them. However his nephew Thomas Jones contested the will in the Court of Chancery. By 1828, the estate had largely been dissipated by lawsuits and poor management. His corpse, in its distinctive iron coffin, was moved several times over the next decades, but is now lost.Soldon, pp 347‚Äì348 ReferencesBibliography * Braid, Douglas.

Previously, he was the MP for Croydon South from 1966 to 1970. Early life Born into a British Jewish family, Winnick was an advertising manager and a branch chairman of the Clerical and Administrative Workers Union. He was a councillor from 1959 on Willesden Borough Council, then on the London Borough of Brent. Parliamentary career After unsuccessfully fighting Harwich in 1964, Winnick was elected in 1966 as the MP for Croydon South (now the area covered roughly by Croydon Central constituency), defeating incumbent Richard Thompson. He lost the seat to Thompson in 1970. After completing a diploma in social administration at the London School of Economics, he stood again unsuccessfully in Croydon Central in October 1974 and was returned for Walsall North in 1979. Winnick is generally regarded as being on the left of the Labour Party and has a strong commitment to human rights. That commitment made him a strong voice in the House of Commons against both the Taliban and Saddam Hussein and he supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He was a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary body from its formation in 1990, and British co- chair, 1997‚Äì2005. On 9 November 2005, Winnick's amendment to a government bill on detention of terrorist suspects without trial, proposing that the maximum period of detention should be 28 days rather than 90, passed in the House of Commons by 323 votes to 290, shortly after the government's 90-day proposal was defeated by 322 to 291. This was Tony Blair's first defeat in the House of Commons on a whipped vote, after serving nearly nine years as Prime Minister, and may come to be seen as a critical moment of his term in office. In January 2009, he urged the Communities Minister to deplore the fact that Richard Williamson, a British-born bishop and Holocaust denier, had been brought back into the fold by the Vatican. Winnick played a prominent role in the campaign to force the resignation of the Speaker of the House of Commons, Michael Martin. This followed controversy from May 2009 concerning MPs' disclosure of expenses. At the 2010 general election, Walsall North was one of the most closely contested seats at the election, with Winnick being re-elected with a significantly reduced majority of 990 votes, compared to 6,640 votes at the previous election five years earlier. In 2015, however, Winnick gained a comfortable majority of 1,937, despite the Labour Party incurring a net loss of seats.

He was the Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Oldham East and Saddleworth from his election in 1997 to 2010. He was the Minister of State for Borders and Immigration in the Home Office, as well as being the Minister of State for the Treasury. On 5 November 2010, he was found to have breached the Representation of the People Act 1983 in the course of the 2010 general election. As a result, his victory of just 103 votes at the 2010 general election campaign was declared void, he lost his seat in the House of Commons, and was barred from standing again for three years. Woolas was also administratively suspended from the Labour Party until his case was considered by the Disputes Panel in January 2011 when it was lifted. Woolas's previous positions include heading the National Union of Students, working as a producer for the BBC's programme Newsnight and a role at the GMB trade union. Early life Woolas was born in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, on 11 December 1959. He went to Nelson Grammar School and, after O levels, Nelson and Colne College. He received a BA in Philosophy from the Victoria University of Manchester. Woolas joined the Labour Party at the age of 16 and became involved in student politics through the Anti-Nazi League. Before becoming an MP, he was president of the National Union of Students from 1984 to 1986, a television producer for the BBC on Newsnight from 1988 to 1990 (where he became firm friends with fellow Manchester United supporter Michael Crick), producer at ITN's Channel 4 News from 1990 to 1991 and head of communications at the GMB trade union from 1991 to 1997. Parliamentary career He first won his seat for Labour in the 1997 general election, having contested the predecessor Littleborough and Saddleworth seat at a by-election in 1995, which was marked by Labour's particularly vicious and personal campaign, attacking the Liberal Democrat candidate, Chris Davies, as \\"high on tax and soft on drugs\\". Peter Mandelson admitted in his autobiography that they had gone \\"on the attack\\", writing \\"After the campaign was over, not only our opponents but some in Labour would denounce our 'negative' tactics in highlighting Lib Dem front-runner Chris Davies' support for higher taxes and a Royal Commission to liberalise drugs laws. For tactical reasons, I felt we had had little choice\\".The Third Man: Life at the Heart of New Labour, Peter Mandelson, HarperPress (15 July 2010) In 1999 Woolas became parliamentary private secretary to Lord Macdonald of Tradeston, a Transport Minister, and became a whip in 2001. In June 2003 he was appointed Deputy Leader of the House of Commons under the Government's newly appointed Leader of the Commons, Peter Hain. During the May 2005 ministerial reshuffle, he also served briefly under Hain's successor, Geoff Hoon. Between the same reshuffle and June 2007, Woolas was Minister of State for Local Government at the Deputy Prime Minister's Office and then the Department for Communities and Local Government, the 2006 successor to the DPMO. During 2005, Woolas was accused of evading parliamentary questions with regard to public calls for reform of the Local Government Ombudsman in 2005. On 28 June 2007 he became Minister for the Environment at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (in the Brown ministry). He had responsibility for climate change, energy and sustainable development. In October 2006, Woolas was involved in the United Kingdom debate over veils, particularly the case of Aishah Azmi, a Muslim teaching assistant who wore an Islamic veil in class. In February 2008, he raised the question of inter-cousin marriage as a cause of the high incidence of disability within predominantly Pakistani culture. The debate was welcomed by Ann Cryer MP who cited incidences in her own constituency. This debate is (2011) still continuing. The Daily Telegraph 29. May 2011: Hay Festival 2011: Professor risks political storm over Muslim 'inbreeding‚Äô Following the cabinet re-shuffle of 3 October 2008, he was made Minister of State for Borders and Immigration at the Home Office and Minister of State for the Treasury. In the United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal of 2009, Phil Woolas reportedly claimed expenses for items not allowed under the rules. Woolas said the items were on a receipt he submitted under food claims, but were not claimed themselves, and threatened a newspaper with legal action. The Legge enquiry into MPs' expenses cleared Woolas. In November 2008, Woolas attacked lawyers and charities working on behalf of asylum seekers, accusing them of undermining the law and \\"playing the system\\" by taking legal action. In February 2010, following the accusations of bullyingChris Irvine \\"Downing Street bullying allegations: as it happened\\", Daily Telegraph, 22 February 2010 made against Gordon Brown and other members of the UK cabinet, Woolas was quoted as referring to the head of the National Bullying Helpline, Christine Pratt, as \\"this prat of a woman\\" in a radio interview.Nico Hines \\"Minister Phil Woolas launches personal attack on Christine Pratt\\", The Times, 23 February 2010 Gurkha veterans' resettlement rights In spring 2009, Woolas was involved in a controversy regarding the rights for Gurkhas to settle in the United Kingdom. On 24 April 2009, Woolas proposed a new settlement for Gurkhas who were discharged before 1997. According to The Economist: > Veterans would be allowed to settle only if they met one or more conditions > based on length of service, gallantry or related illness. Many of the > requirements seemed designed to frustrate: for example, one way to qualify > automatically was by soldiering for at least 20 years, though most rank-and- > file Gurkhas serve for only 15. Another was to prove that a long-term > medical condition was caused or worsened by active service; a tall order for > those whose injuries were sustained decades ago. These proposals later were denounced in a vote at the House of Commons, with many Labour MPs voting across party lines. Woolas was later confronted at the BBC Westminster studios by the actress Joanna Lumley, the face of the Gurkha Justice Campaign. After Ms Lumley pursued him around the studio, the pair held an impromptu press conference in which she pressured him into agreeing to further talks over the settlement rights of Gurkhas. On 21 May, Home Secretary Jacqui Smith announced that all Gurkha veterans who had served four years or more in the British Army before 1997 would be allowed to settle in Britain. Gurkhas serving after 1997 had been given UK settlement rights in 2004. Woolas stated that cost was a prime consideration: \\"Our estimate is ¬£1.4 billion, and I remind the House that that would come from the defence budget.\\" However, according to a Freedom of Information request, the only impact on the Defence budget has been ¬£20,000 per year to set up and run the settlement office in Kathmandu. 2010 Labour leadership election Woolas was re-elected in the 2010 general election, although the result would later be overturned by an election court. Woolas gave his backing to close political ally David Miliband and represented him at events throughout the country. The Times described Woolas as \\"a campaign fixer for Mr Miliband\\". However, Woolas officially nominated Diane Abbott, at the request of Miliband. Woolas said, \\"I nominated her as an act of pluralism. We thought it would send a strong signal that David will be an inclusive leader.\\" 2010 re-election and election court case In his 2010 re-election campaign, Woolas's campaigning methods were heavily criticised by his Liberal Democrat opponents and the Muslim Public Affairs Committee UK (MPACUK). Critics accused him, among other things, of \\"inflaming racial tensions\\" in an area that has already known race riots. Trevor Phillips, head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission and former Labour politician, described some of the language used in the party's leaflets as \\"not helpful.\\"Equality Commission Chief Criticises Woolas Leaflets Woolas and his agent, Joe Fitzpatrick, were also responsible for photo manipulation of images in his election addresses. In one case they manipulated an image to show his Liberal Democrat opponent Elwyn Watkins in front of armed police, allegedly to imply Watkins had been arrested. This was a composite image, consisting of a portrait of Watkins and a photograph of armed police patrolling London. The Metropolitan Police insignia was also airbrushed from a female officer's jacket. Woolas won the election and was returned to Parliament with a majority of 103 votes ‚Äì down from 3,590. Following the election of Ed Miliband as the Labour Party Leader, Woolas was reappointed to the immigration brief on the shadow front bench team. The New Statesman said it was a \\"bizarre decision\\" as Woolas had \\"run one of the most disgraceful election campaigns in recent history\\". Election court case On 28 May 2010, Woolas's Liberal Democrat opponent, Elwyn Watkins, issued an election petition against the result under section 106 of the Representation of the People Act 1983, which makes it illegal to make false statements of fact about a candidate. Watkins claimed that leaflets issued by Woolas falsely portrayed Watkins as taking unlawful foreign donations, and linked him to Muslim extremists. During the court case, held in public at Saddleworth Civic Hall, a number of emails between Woolas and his campaign team emerged. In one, Woolas's agent and former Labour councillor, Joseph Fitzpatrick emailed Woolas and Steven Green, the MP's campaign adviser, to say: \\"Things are not going as well as I had hoped ... we need to think about our first attack leaflet.\\" A reply from Fitzpatrick said: \\"If we don‚Äôt get the white vote angry he‚Äôs gone.\\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/8114201/Digraced-Phil-Woolas- and-the-plot-to-get-angry-white-votes.html During the course of the court case, both Woolas and Fitzpatrick were cautioned by the presiding judge in respect of possible criminal charges relating to election offences. The court hearing finished in September 2010. In November 2010, the court ruled that Woolas breached section 106 of the Representation of the People Act 1983, and ordered a fresh election for the seat to be held. In a statement released through his lawyer, Woolas stated that \\"this election petition raised fundamental issues about the freedom to question and criticise politicians\\" and that it \\"will inevitably chill political speech\\". Woolas applied for a judicial review into the ruling, but as the Labour Party withdrew its support he had to finance it himself, and he started to ask for donations. The High Court rejected his request for a judicial review. Woolas launched a second judicial review, technically a renewed application for permission to seek judicial review, and was heard in person at the High Court on 16 November 2010.Phil Woolas: I‚Äôve been humbled by support , Manchester Evening News, 15 November 2010 The judges' decision took longer than expected, with them saying that there were \\"difficult questions to resolve\\". Following the initial court result, Woolas received goodwill messages from former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown and from Cherie Blair, wife of former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair. Labour MP Graham Stringer (Blackley and Broughton) was vocally supportive and criticised Harman and the party for suspending Woolas.Gordon Brown and Cherie Blair back Phil Woolas over election fight , Manchester Evening News, 9 November 2010 A decision on this second request was published on 3 December 2010. Woolas was accompanied to court by the Labour Shadow Health Secretary John Healey.Woolas loses his appeal The court granted Woolas permission to bring judicial review and that review overturned one of the three breaches of the section 106 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 found by the Election Court. The other two breaches stood: \\"this does not affect the certificate as the findings of an illegal practice in relation to the other two matters cannot be impugned\\". On leaving court, Woolas said, \\"It is the end of the road ‚Äì I am out.\\" A by-election to elect a new Member of Parliament for his former seat was held on 13 January 2011, in which the new Labour candidate, Debbie Abrahams, defeated Elwyn Watkins. After the review ruling, a Labour spokesman said, \\"The Labour Party administratively suspended Phil Woolas after the original judgment of the election court. Following the conclusion of this judicial review, the Labour Party will consider this issue in detail and whether further action is appropriate.\\"Phil Woolas loses bid to overturn court decision removing him from parliament , by Andrew Sparrow, The Guardian, 3 December 2010 Although the verdict of the election court indicated a prima facie breach of criminal law, in March 2011 the Crown Prosecution Service announced that it would not bring criminal charges against Woolas as the finding of the Election Court already disqualified him from holding elected office and they felt that this was sufficient punishment. The CPS also declined to prosecute Joseph Fitzpatrick although as election agent he was responsible for the items deemed to have broken the law; he later stood unsuccessfully in Oldham as a council candidate for UKIP. Personal life Woolas is married to events organiser and ex-lobbyist Tracey Jane Allen, former co-director of lobbying firm Morgan Allen Moore. Current activities Woolas is a director of two organisations ‚Äì Boothwood Partners, an environmental consultancy, and Wellington Street Partners, a political lobbying partnership originally formed with former MPs Paul Keetch (Lib Dem) and Sir Sydney Chapman (Conservative).

Early life Wright attended to St George's Infant School, Priory Junior School, and Hospital Secondary Modern School. From 1970‚Äì74, he was an engineering apprentice, then a mechanical engineer from 1974‚Äì83. He worked originally with ErieElectronics, and then was subsequently employed at Brown and Root and Probe Oil Tools. It was through his work as an engineer that he became involved in a trade union and entered politics. Political career In his political career, Wright first stood for a Council seat in 1979 and missed out losing by 86 votes. He was subsequently voted in 1980 until 1982 when he lost by 15 votes. Wright was then re-elected in 1986 and remained a Councillor until 1998. In total he served fourteen years for Great Yarmouth Borough Council and was chairman of various committees, Deputy Leader for four years and Leader of the council for over two years from 1995 until 1997. In addition, in 1983 Wright was employed by Great Yarmouth Labour Party as full-time organiser up until the 1997 general election when he was elected as Member of Parliament for Great Yarmouth and retained his seat at both the 2001 and 2005 elections. He is a member of Amicus and the GMB Union. During his time in Parliament, Wright sat on several committees including the Public Administration Committee and Trade and Industry Select Committee. He was active within many All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG's), including chairing the APPG for Sea Cadets and acting as treasurer for the United Kingdom Parliamentary Football Club, which is itself attributed to a great deal of charity work. Wright lists among his main accomplishments during his parliamentary career as including the securing of Objective 2 status for Great Yarmouth, securing Assisted Area status helping to attract new investment to the area, the increase in funding to Great Yarmouth's schools, police force and hospital and the introduction of SureStart services.

Controversy Wright found himself landed in controversy in June 2009 during the British MPs' expenses scandal when it emerged that he had accepted a ¬£10,000 sweetener from the new owners of a rented accommodation in Dolphin Square, London SW1 on the understanding he accepted a ¬£1,000 a month rent increase at the tax payers expense. He justified keeping the money by claiming \\"he took a financial hit from having to work in London when he was first elected in 1997\\" and highlighting how the money actually saved the tax payer ¬£10,000 as it was not from the public purse. Shortly after on 1 June, Wright issued a statement on this issue on his personal website: > When I was first elected I decided not to purchase a property in London but > to rent instead as it was not my priority to get into the 'housing market' > in order to make a potential 'profit'. It was necessary however to have > somewhere to stay in London whilst I was carrying out my parliamentary > duties and for this reason, I rented. In the first few years the rent and > other costs exceeded the allowance at that time but I met these extra costs > personally. The lease ownership of this rented flat changed and as a result > of this I received a payment from the new owners. Wright was not asked to repay anything in the results of the Legg Report https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/oct/16/mps-expenses-list-who-owes but later had to repay a duplicated claim of ¬£3,050.

History Long before Birdsville was established by British colonists, the region in which it is situated was occupied by indigenous Australians, speakers of the Wangkangurru language (also known as Arabana/Wangkangurru, Wangganguru, Wanggangurru or Wongkangurru), whose extent ranged from Birdsville south towards Innamincka and Lake Eyre, including the modern local government areas of the Shire of Diamantina as well as the Outback Communities Authority of South Australia. Although British explorers had passed through the Diamantina district in the 1840s and early 1860s, pastoralists did not occupy this semi- arid region until the mid-1870s. Annandale, Pandie Pandie, Glengyle and Roseberth were taken up in 1876; Sandringham, Cacoory and Haddon Downs in 1877; and Dubbo Downs in 1878. Monkira, Mt Leonard, Cluny and Coorabulka were other early holdings. In the early 1880s the towns of Birdsville and Bedourie were established to service the newly taken up pastoral holdings of the Diamantina. Reputedly, a merchant named Matthew Flynn, who carried stores for the stations, built a rough depot in the late 1870s at the site of the present town of Birdsville, then known as the Diamantina Crossing, on the stock route from Boulia south to Adelaide. By mid-1885, when the township of Birdsville was officially surveyed, a number of buildings had been erected at the Diamantina Crossing, including a police lock-up (1883), Groth's Royal Hotel (), William Blair's Birdsville Hotel (), Curtain's Tattersalls Hotel, and at least 3 stores and 1 shop. Diamantina Shire was established in 1883, and its headquarters were at Birdsville until moved to Bedourie in 1953. Birdsville Post Office opened on 1 January 1883. Birdsville, over west of Brisbane and north of the Queensland-South Australian border, developed as an administrative centre for police and border customs. Nearly all the trade of the town was with Adelaide, and it became an important marshalling point for cattle being driven south to markets in South Australia. By 1889 the population of Birdsville was 110, and the town had 2 general stores, 3 hotels, a police station, school, 2 blacksmith shops, 2 bakers, a cordial manufacturer, bootmaker, saddler, auctioneer & commission agent, and a number of residences. The population peaked in 1895 at 220. Birdsville State School opened on 14 August 1899. The school closed in 1948 and has subsequently reopened. Birdsville is located at the border of South Australia and Queensland to collect tolls from the droves of cattle being moved interstate. Almost all the buildings in the town were of local sandstone, there being no local timber available. Distance and the lack of good access roads or a railway created prohibitively high transportation costs, so imported building materials were kept to a minimum. The name There are a number of different theories as to the origin of the name. One is that the name was suggested by Robert Frew, owner of Pandie Pandie Station, who also had a store and shop at the Diamantina Crossing, in reference to the prolific bird life in the district. The other is that a store was established by Percy Bird and George Field and they called it Birdfield. However, in 1882, G. and R. Wills, of Adelaide, misaddressed a consignment of goods as going to Birdsville and that name stuck. Another is that a man named Burt established a store and called it Burtsville which corrupted to Birdsville. Whatever its origin, by 1882, the name Birdsville was in common use. The name was adopted in the 1885 survey and was formalised at the proclamation of town in 1887. Population At the 2016 census, Birdsville had a population of 140. 86.1% of people were born in Australia and 94.2% of people only spoke English at home. Birdsville had a population of over 300 at the turn of the twentieth century. It had three hotels, a cordial factory, blacksmith store, market gardens, police and customs facilities but after Federation in 1901, the tolls were abolished and the town fell into decline to about 50 people throughout the 1950s. Livestock trade kept the region alive and in recent times tourism has joined cattle as the major industry in the area. Heritage listings Birdsville has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Adelaide Street: former Australian Inland Mission Hospital * Adelaide Street: Birdsville Courthouse * Adelaide Street: Royal Hotel * Burt Street: Birdsville Hotel * Eyre Developmental Road: Carcory Homestead Ruin * In the north of the locality: Burke and Wills \\"Plant Camp\\" * Glengyle Station, Bedourie: Kidman's Tree of Knowledge Geography Birdsville is located by the Diamantina River in the Diamantina Shire, which has a population of 326 persons (Census 2001). The Birdsville Track extends from Marree in South Australia through the Strzelecki Desert before ending at Birdsville. Facilities When it was proclaimed, the town had three hotels, two stores, a customs house for interstate trade, a police station and a large collection of commercial buildings but in 2007 there was just one hotel serving canned or bottled beer, library, visitor information centre, museum and a hospital. Diamantina Shire Council operates Birdsville Library at 29 Burt Street, Birdsville. Today Birdsville is a popular tourist destination with many people using it as a stopping point across the Simpson Desert. It is also known for the annual Birdsville Races, which are held in September each year in aid of the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia. The town's tiny population is augmented by between 7000 and 9000 people for the two-day event, and hundreds of aircraft fill the town's airstrip. In 2010 the races were cancelled for the first time in the event's history due to rain. There are many other events, such as \\"The Big Red Run\\" and the \\"Big Red Bash\\", held at Birdsville throughout the winter tourist season. Birdsville also has an 80 kW geothermal power station, the only one of its type in Australia. Water is extracted from an 80-year-old bore on the Great Artesian Basin at 98 ¬∞C and is used to heat the operating fluid isopentane in a Rankine Cycle engine. The geothermal plant produces around one third of the town's electricity. The water (once cooled) is also the source of the town's drinking water. A plan by Ergon Energy to expand the 80 kW power plant to completely meet Birdsville's electricity requirements has been shelved, in favour of increasing the use of solar power and battery storage. Birdsville boasts a state primary school, with a current enrolment of three children, a police station manned by one officer, and a hospital staffed by one nurse. The town is situated near a billabong on which a pontoon was built to facilitate swimming and non-powered boating activities. In 2012, the billabong became home to a stray freshwater crocodile, which was subsequently removed and relocated by park ranger Don Rowlands OAM. Climate Birdsville has a hot desert climate (BWh in the K√∂ppen climate classification) with an average of only 22 days of rain a year. Summers are extremely hot and dry, with winters being mild to warm. The median annual rainfall at Birdsville is The actual amount of rain which falls is highly variable, for example, in 1914 just was recorded while fell in 1917. Dust storms are most likely during periods of strong wind which typically occur in spring. Birdsville has recorded the highest confirmed temperature in the state of Queensland, with having been recorded on more than one occasion. Birdsville disease Birdsville disease is an illness observed in horses, caused by eating the native plant Birdsville indigo (Indigofera linnaei) which contain natural toxins including the neurotoxin 3 nitropropionic acid (3-NPA). The affected horses exhibit weakness and lack of coordination; it can be fatal. It does not appear to affect cattle. Although it is not unique to Birdsville, the condition was first observed in the Birdsville district in May 1886. While there were many theories about the cause of the disease including plants, worms and sunstroke, it was not until 1950 that researchers identified the precise cause. Mildly affected horses can recover with a regime of drenching with gelatine and feeding a diet high in arginine but euthanasia is recommended for severely affected horses. As there is no cure, preventing horses from grazing on indigo is recommended. In popular culture * Elizabeth Haran's 2004 novel Stars in the Southern Sky is set in the town (though renamed to Kangaroo Crossing). * The 2014 British comedy film The Inbetweeners 2 had scenes set in the town. * The 1983 novel 'The Film-Makers' by Kenneth and Kerry Cook is partially set in Birdsville. *Slim Dusty sings a song about the Birdsville Pub (hotel) called Where Country Is *The 1954 Film The Back of Beyond was about the 300 km mail run to Birdsville.

Tiger eye or goat eye is a gene causing diluted eye color in horses. There are two variants, Tiger-eye 1 (TE1) and Tiger-eye 2 (TE2), which are both recessive. Horses displaying tiger eye typically have a yellow, orange, or amber iris. Tiger eye has only been found in Puerto Rican Paso Fino horses. Horses of related breeds were tested (90 Colombian Pasos, 20 Mangalargas, 44 Lusitanos, and 42 Andalusian horses), and none were found to have either tiger eye allele. No obvious link between eye shade and coat color was seen, making this the first studied gene in horses to affect eye color but not coat color. Tiger eye does not appear to affect vision, and there were no signs of reduced pigment on the retina or retinal pigment epithelium. Genotypes This palomino is homozygous for Tiger-eye 2, and has blue eyes. * TE1/TE1 or TE1/TE2: Yellow, amber, or bright orange eyes. * TE2/TE2: Blue eyes when in combination with cream. It is not known what this looks like without cream. Only one horse has been tested to carry this genotype. * TE1/n, TE2/n, or n/n: Dark eyes. Molecular genetics The gene involved codes for SLC24A5, a solute carrier known to be involved in pigmentation in other species. SLC24A5 is found on equine chromosome 1 base pairs 141,657,837‚Äì141,678,329 and the protein is a potassium-dependent sodium‚Äìcalcium ion exchanger involved in melanocyte maturation. The protein is believed to be located in the trans-golgi network of melanocytes. Tiger-eye 1 is a missense mutation (c.272A>T and p.Phe91Tyr) in which a single adenine is replaced with a thymine in exon 2, changing a phenylalanine to a tyrosine in the resulting protein. Tiger-eye 2 is a deletion (c.875-340_1081+82del) in which the entirety of exon 7, and a bit of the introns on either side, are removed, resulting in a protein that is 69 amino acids shorter. Both mutations are predicted to be deleterious to protein function. In other species SLC24A5 is involved in pigmentation in humans, mice, and zebrafish. In mice a targeted mutation was found which diluted the eye color without visibly affecting coat color, though a closer examination found that the melanosomes were smaller and paler than the wild type. Unlike tiger eye in horses, the mice showed reduced pigment in the retinal pigment epithelium. In humans a widespread mutation to the homologous gene plays a large role in the light skin color of European humans, and another mutation can cause oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) type 6 (OCA6), which impairs vision. No vision impairment is seen in horses, and the coat color is not visibly affected.

Unlike primary elections in most other U.S. states, where registered voters go to polling places to cast ballots, Iowans instead gather at local caucus meetings to discuss and vote on the candidates. During both the presidential and midterm election seasons, registered Iowan voters vote in a per-precinct caucus for the party of which they are registered as a member. The caucuses are also held to select delegates to county conventions and party committees, among other party activities. The Iowa caucuses used to be noteworthy as the first major contest of the United States presidential primary season. Although caucus-goers have been unrepresentative of the nation's overall ethnic demographic, caucuses are still seen by some as a strong indicator of how a presidential candidate will do in later contests. This could be seen as a \\"self-fulfilling prophecy\\", however, due to the positioning of the Iowa caucus as the first major contest in the election season; being the first, it strongly influences later races and provides candidates with momentum going into the following contests. Further, candidates who do poorly in the Iowa caucus are likely to drop out in the following days. The 2020 Iowa Republican caucuses and the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses took place on February 3, 2020. The Democratic caucus proved controversial after difficulties and errors in the reporting of the final vote totals. Iowa Democratic Party Chair Troy Price resigned on February 12, 2020 over the chaos resulting from the caucus. Background Political parties in Iowa have used caucuses to select party leaders and candidates for office since the 1800s. Before 1907, parties selected all candidates for political office through the caucus system. Iowa held a presidential primary in 1916, but returned to the caucus system in 1917 due to high costs and low participation. After the 1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity, Democratic Party leaders decided to make changes to their presidential nomination process by spreading out the schedule in each state. Because Iowa had a complex process of precinct caucuses, county conventions, district conventions, and a state convention, they chose to start early. In 1972, Iowa was the first state to hold its Democratic caucus, and it had the first Republican caucus four years later. Under Iowa law, political parties are required to hold caucuses every two years to select delegates to county conventions and party committees. Process A 2008 Democratic caucus meeting in Iowa City, Iowa The Iowa caucuses operate very differently from the primary election used by most other states (see U.S. presidential primary). The caucuses are generally defined as \\"gatherings of neighbors\\". Rather than going to polls and casting ballots, Iowans gather at a set location in each of Iowa's precincts. Typically, these meetings occur in schools, churches, public libraries, or even individuals' houses. Caucuses are held every two years, during both the presidential and midterm election seasons, but those that receive national attention are the presidential preference caucuses, held every four years. The rules of the caucus process to determine delegates to national conventions are determined by the party and differ substantially between the Democratic and Republican parties. In addition to the voting and the presidential preference choices, caucus-goers begin the process of writing their parties' platforms by introducing resolutions. Criticisms Public focus has been increasingly drawn to the Iowa caucus procedure. Particularly after the 2020 Iowa Democratic Caucus in which numerous irregularities were revealed, disputed caucus totals following the disastrous initial use of a new smartphone app developed for the caucus, and a failure to publish official results for nearly a week heavily undermined public confidence in the integrity of the caucus system. Many individuals and groups argue that the caucus process inherently suppresses the vote of working-class people who are not able to take several hours away from work or caring for family to go caucus. There are also concerns that Iowa's racial demographics, nearly 93% white, are not reflective of the country's general ethnic makeup and therefore make it an inappropriate state to hold such a critical position in America's election system. Many political figures have also echoed concerns: Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL): \\"I think the Democratic caucus in Iowa is a quirky, quaint tradition which should come to an end. As we try to make voting easier for people across America, the Iowa caucus is the most painful situation we currently face for voting.\\" Former presidential candidate Juli√°n Castro, who has long been critical of the Iowa caucuses, blasted the process: \\"It's a mess. What we saw out there and heard about are, consistently, errors in the way that this process was done, whether in the initial phase or the realignment. Inconsistencies in how it was done across precinct sites, caucus sites. It is a total mess.\\" Democratic Party Each precinct divides its delegate seats among the candidates in proportion to caucus goers' votes. Participants indicate their support for a particular candidate by standing in a designated area of the caucus site (forming a preference group). An area may also be designated for an \\"uncommitted\\" group. Participants may try to convince their neighbors to support their candidates. Each preference group might informally deputize a few members to recruit supporters from the other groups and, in particular, from among those undecided. Undecided participants might visit each preference group to ask its members about their candidate. After some time, the electioneering is temporarily halted, and the supporters for each candidate (and for \\"uncommitted\\") are counted. At this point, the caucus officials determine which candidates or groups are viable, potentially including the \\"uncommitted\\" group. Depending on the number of county delegates to be elected, the viability threshold is no less than 15% of attendees. (For four or more delegates, the threshold is 15%. For three delegates, the threshold is the total number of voters, divided by 6, roughly 16.66%. For two delegates, the threshold is 25%. For one delegate, there is no threshold, and the delegate is elected by a majority vote of eligible voters in attendance, following the first round of alignment.) For a candidate (or the \\"uncommitted\\" group) to earn any delegates from a particular precinct, the candidate or group must have the support of at least the percentage of participants required by the viability threshold. Once viability is determined, participants have an opportunity to realign: although supporters of viable candidates or groups are locked into their choice, the supporters of nonviable candidates or groups may find a viable candidate or group to support, join together with supporters of another nonviable candidate or group to secure a delegate for one of the two, or abstain. This realignment is a distinction of caucuses in that (unlike in most primaries) a voter's second choice can help a candidate. When the voting is closed, a final headcount is conducted, and each precinct apportions delegates to the county convention. These numbers are reported to the state party, which counts the total number of delegates for each candidate (and delegates who are \\"uncommitted\\") and reports the results to the media. Most of the participants go home, leaving a few to finish the business of the caucus: each preference group elects its delegates, and then the groups reconvene to elect local party officers and discuss the platform. The delegates are chosen by the precinct then go to a later caucus, the county convention, to choose delegates to the district convention and state convention. Most of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention are selected at the district convention, with the remaining ones selected at the state convention. Delegates to each level of convention are initially bound to support their chosen candidate but can later switch in a process very similar to what occurs at the precinct level; however, as major shifts in delegate support are rare, the media declares the candidate with the most delegates on the precinct caucus night the winner and relatively little attention is paid to the later caucuses. In 2014, the Iowa Democratic Party introduced changes to the caucus system to allow members of the military to participate in a statewide caucus and establish satellite caucuses for voters with disabilities and others who have trouble making it to the physical location of the caucuses. They will also work for the passage of a new law that requires employers to allow employees to take time off for the caucuses. In 2016, the Iowa Democratic Party held a tele-caucus for military members serving out-of- state and Iowans living abroad. In addition, it held satellite caucuses in 2016, in an attempt to improve accessibility and participation in the Iowa caucuses. Starting in 2020, 10% of state convention delegates will be assigned through tele-caucuses. Beginning with the 2020 caucus, the Iowa Democratic Party publishes not only \\"State Delegate Equivalents\\", based on a calculation of likely delegate results after the state caucus is held, but also a statewide raw vote count after the first alignment round (including results for all non-viable candidates) and a statewide raw vote count for all viable candidates after the second alignment round. Republican Party For Republicans, the Iowa caucus used to follow the Iowa Straw Poll in August of the preceding year. The Iowa Straw Poll was held six times, but only three Straw Poll winners went on to win the caucus the following year. The Straw Poll was discontinued in June 2015. The process of selecting Iowa delegates to the Republican National Convention prior to the 2016 election cycle started with the selection of delegates to the county conventions, which in turn affected the delegates elected to district conventions who also served as delegates to the state convention where delegates were chosen for the national convention. This process rewarded candidate organizers who not only got supporters to the caucus sites but also got supporters willing to serve as delegates to county conventions and willing to vote for other delegates who supported a specific candidate. In 2012, this process resulted in Ron Paul supporters dominating the Iowa delegation to the Republican National Convention, having 22 of the 28 Iowa delegates, with Mitt Romney getting the other six delegates. Because the delegates elected at the caucuses are not required to declare a candidate preference, the media does not always have a purely objective way to determine the success of individual candidates at the caucuses. The media focused on the secret ballot polling conducted at the caucus sites and have generally referred to this non-binding poll as the caucus. There were irregularities in the 2012 caucus site polling results, including the fact that eight precinct results went missing and were never counted. Because of the irregularities in the process and the fact that the totals reported to the media were unrelated to the delegate selection process, there have been changes in both how the caucus site secret ballot polling is sent to state party headquarters and in how Iowa delegates to the national convention are required to vote. Beginning with the 2012 presidential election, Iowa switched from the old winner-take-all allocation to proportional allocation. The change was made to prolong the race, giving lesser-known candidates a chance and making it harder for a frontrunner to secure the majority early. It was also hoped that this change in the election system would energize the base of the party. Starting in 2016, caucus results have become binding when selecting delegates. Acting in accordance with a mandate from the Republican National Committee, the delegates are bound on the first ballot to vote for candidates in proportion to the votes cast for each candidate at the caucus sites. History Since 1972, the Iowa caucuses have had a 55% success rate at predicting which Democrat, and a 43% success rate at predicting which Republican, will go on to win the nomination of their political party for president at that party's national conventionStory Hinckley, How the Iowa caucus predicts presidential losers, not winners, The Christian Science Monitor January 26, 2016  2004  Since Republican President George W. Bush did not face any opposition in 2004, only Democratic caucuses were held. The meetings ran from 6:30 p.m. until approximately 7:00 p.m. on January 19, 2004, with a turnout of about 124,000 caucus-goers. The county convention occurred on March 13, the district convention on April 24, and the state convention on June 26. Delegates could and did change their votes based on further developments in the race; for instance, in 2004 the delegates pledged to Dick Gephardt, who left the race after the precinct caucuses, chose a different candidate to support at the county, district, and state level. The number of delegates each candidate receives eventually determines how many state delegates from Iowa that candidate will have at the Democratic National Convention. Iowa sends 56 delegates to the DNC out of a total of 4,366. Of the 45 delegates that were chosen through the caucus system, 29 were chosen at the district level. Ten delegates were at-large delegates, and six were \\"party leader and elected official\\" (PLEO) delegates; these were assigned at the state convention. There were also 11 other delegates, eight of whom were appointed from local Democratic National Committee members; two were PLEO delegates and one was elected at the state Democratic convention. John Kerry won the Iowa caucuses with 38% of the vote, John Edwards coming second. 2008 The 2008 Iowa Democratic caucuses and 2008 Iowa Republican caucuses took place January 3 at 7 p.m. CT. Candidates spent tens of millions of dollars on local television advertisements and hundreds of paid staff in dozens of field offices. Barack Obama (D) and Mike Huckabee (R) were the eventual winners. 2012 The 2012 Iowa caucuses took place on Tuesday, January 3, starting at 7 p.m. CST. Incumbent president Barack Obama only faced minor opposition in the Democratic caucus and received 98% of the vote, but the Republican caucus was heavily contested between several challengers. Initial results reported that Mitt Romney beat out Rick Santorum by just 8 votes, but when the final results came out two weeks later Rick Santorum secured the victory over Romney by a margin of 34 votes with Ron Paul in a strong 3rd. Results were certified by the Caucus, but not by the Republican party, who declared it a split decision due to missing reports from 8 precincts, but who later certified the caucus as a win for Santorum. The caucus winner changed yet again when the Iowa delegate totals were finally determined giving Ron Paul the win along with several other states that same weekend. 2016 Democratic precinct 61, 2016 The 2016 Iowa caucuses took place on Monday, February 1. The counting started at 7 p.m. CST and lasted one hour, after the caucus discussions. For the first time, results were electronically sent to both Democratic and Republican headquarters. In the Democratic caucus, Hillary Clinton received 45% of the vote and 23 pledged delegates, defeating Bernie Sanders, with 41% and 21 delegates. The Republican caucus awarded delegates to nine candidates: 8 to Ted Cruz, with 28% of the vote; 7 each to Donald Trump and Marco Rubio, with 24% and 23% respectively; 3 to Ben Carson, with 9%; and 1 delegate each to five other candidates. 2020 Iowa Caucus Precinct 15 in Ames (2020) During First Alignment The 2020 Iowa caucuses occurred on Monday, February 3. The results of the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucus were delayed due to \\"inconsistencies in the reporting of three sets of results,‚Äù according to Mandy McClure, the party's communications director. ‚ÄúIn addition to the tech systems being used to tabulate results, we are also using photos of results and a paper trail to validate that all results match and ensure that we have confidence and accuracy in the numbers we report. This is simply a reporting issue, the app did not go down and this is not a hack or an intrusion. The underlying data and paper trail is sound and will simply take time to further report the results.\\" Delays in reporting were attributed to the failure of a new reporting app for the Iowa Democratic Party presidential caucus, including an inability to download or launch the app as well as an inability for the app to function well once launched; the failure of the backup phone number system after too many people attempted to call the phone number due to the failing app; and confusion over the correct way to count and calculate the initial and final popular votes as well as state delegate equivalent values. A complete official count of the first alignment popular vote, the second alignment popular vote, and state delegate equivalents was released on February 6, 3 days after Iowa Democrats voted. However, various outlets including The New York Times and NBC News reported logical inconsistencies in certain precincts (such as state delegate equivalents being awarded to the wrong candidates and more people voting for the second alignment than the first alignment). This led to the Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez to request the state Democratic Party (which runs the caucuses) to \\"recanvass\\" or recalculate the results including state delegate equivalents. The app in question was provided by a 5-month-old company, Shadow Inc., which failed to develop and test the product adequately.Vaughan-Nichols, Steven J. (6 February 2020). \\"How the Iowa caucus app went wrong and how open source could have helped\\". ZDNet website Retrieved 8 February 2020. The CEO and founder, Tara McGowan, also founded the ACRONYM corporation in 2017 and Courier Newsroom in 2019. Her husband, Michael Halle, is a senior strategist to the campaign of Pete Buttigieg. Multiple unverified claims of the Buttigieg campaign funding the organization, having investment interests in, and even sharing partial ownership in either company have been made. However, the only verified transactions between the Buttigieg campaign and either entity is a contract for text and messages services. The Joe Biden campaign had also contracted with Shadow, Inc for the same services, as well as former candidate Kristen Gillibrand. After the app failure, McGowan distanced herself and ACRONYM from Shadow Inc., stating that it was an \\"independent\\" entity. Both companies are founded and directed by McGowan and Halle, and they share the same registered address.

Its setting is a utopian farming commune based on Brook Farm, of which Hawthorne was a founding member and where he lived in 1841. The novel dramatizes the conflict between the commune's ideals and the members' private desires and romantic rivalries. In Hawthorne (1879), Henry James called it \\"the lightest, the brightest, the liveliest\\" of Hawthorne's \\"unhumorous fictions,\\" while literary critic Richard Brodhead has described it as \\"the darkest of Hawthorne's novels.\\"Brodhead, Richard. Hawthorne, Melville, and the Novel, p. 111. Plot summary The story takes place primarily in the utopian community of Blithedale, presumably in the mid-1800s. The main character, Miles Coverdale, embarks on a quest for the betterment of the world through the agrarian lifestyle and community of the Blithedale Farm. The story begins with a conversation between Coverdale and Old Moodie, a character who reappears throughout the story. The legend of the mysterious Veiled Lady is introduced; she is a popular clairvoyant who disappears unannounced from the social scene. Coverdale then makes the voyage to Blithedale, where he is introduced to such characters as Zenobia and Mr. and Mrs. Silas Foster. At their first community dinner, they are interrupted by the arrival of Hollingsworth, a previous acquaintance of Coverdale, who is carrying a frail, pale girl. Though Hollingsworth believes the girl (whose age never is clarified) is an expected guest, none of the Blithedale citizens recognize her. She immediately develops a strong attachment to Zenobia, and reveals her name to be Priscilla. Soon after, Coverdale becomes severely ill and is bedridden. During his sickness, he believes he is on the brink of death and develops a closeness with Hollingsworth due to their anxiety-ridden situation and discussion of worldly ideals. Hollingsworth and Zenobia take care of him, and he returns to health shortly. As he recovers and spring comes, the residents of the community begin to work the land successfully and prove to their neighbors the plausibility of their cause. Priscilla starts to open up, and relationships between the other characters develop as well. Tension in the friendship between Coverdale and Hollingsworth intensifies as their philosophical disagreements continue. Meanwhile, Zenobia and Hollingsworth become close, and rumor flies they might build a house together. Mr. Moodie makes a reappearance and asks about Priscilla and Zenobia for reasons to be revealed later. Coverdale then meets a stranger who turns out to be a Professor Westervelt. Westervelt also asks about Zenobia and Hollingsworth. Coverdale does not like the Professor, and when he is retreating in a tree he overhears the Professor talking to Zenobia and implying that they have a prior relationship. At this point, the narrator of the story briefly switches to Zenobia as she tells a tale titled ‚ÄúThe Silvery Veil.‚Äù She describes the Veiled Lady and her background, though it is never revealed whether her version of the story is true or not. After switching narration back to Coverdale, the story proceeds to Eliot's Pulpit, a place of rest and discourse for the four main characters (Coverdale, Hollingsworth, Priscilla, and Zenobia). There they discuss women's rights, and Zenobia and Hollingsworth agree, against Coverdale, on a more misogynistic point of view. Their disagreements intensify the next day when Hollingsworth and Coverdale discuss their hopes for the future of Blithedale. They disagree so thoroughly that Coverdale renounces Hollingsworth and effectively ends their friendship. A turning point in the novel, the drama culminates with Coverdale's leaving the farm and returning to the city. He there shows a sort of voyeurism, peeping through hotel windows at a young man and another family. While peeping, he spies Zenobia and Westervelt in another window. They notice, and embarrassed and curious, Coverdale visits them and gets chastised by Zenobia. She reveals that Priscilla is staying with them, and then all three leave Coverdale for an unnamed appointment. Motivated once more by curiosity, he seeks Old Moodie, who when drunk tells him the story of Fauntleroy, Zenobia, and Priscilla. It turns out that Old Moodie is Fauntleroy and the father of Zenobia, and was once a wealthy man. He fell from grace, but remarried later and had another child, Priscilla, making the two women half sisters. Coverdale is extremely shocked and proceeds to a show of the Veiled Lady, where he recognizes Westervelt as the magician controlling the clairvoyant and Hollingsworth in the audience. He asks the whereabouts of Priscilla, and it is shortly revealed, when Hollingsworth removes the veil, that Priscilla is the Veiled Lady. All of the main characters then return and meet at Eliot's Pulpit. Zenobia accosts Hollingsworth for his love for Priscilla, expresses her depression, and acknowledges her sisterhood with Priscilla. However, Priscilla chooses Hollingsworth over her, and the three go their separate ways. When Zenobia realizes that Coverdale witnessed this scene, she asks him to tell Hollingsworth that he has ‚Äúmurdered‚Äù her and tells him that when they next meet it will be behind the ‚Äúblack veil,‚Äù representing death. She leaves and does not return. Hollingsworth, Coverdale, and Silas Foster form a search party and find Zenobia's body in the river. She is buried at Blithedale and given a simple funeral, at which Westervelt makes a last cryptic appearance and declares her suicide foolish. Hollingsworth is severely affected by the death, and it seems as she promised that Zenobia is haunting him. Priscilla is less affected due to her attachment solely to Hollingsworth, and the rest of the characters part and proceed with their lives. The last chapter reflects on the wisdom and ideals of Coverdale, now cynical about his purpose in life. The last sentence reveals cause for his bleak, apathetic outlook‚Äîhe was in love with Priscilla. Major characters Miles Coverdale: The story's protagonist and narrator, Coverdale is a simple observer of the activities of the Blithedale farm. However, his narrative occasionally exaggerates or becomes dreamlike and is not entirely trustworthy.Winslow, Joan. ‚ÄúNew Light on Hawthorne's Miles Coverdale‚Äù The Journal of Narrative Technique Fall 1977 https://www.jstor.org/stable/30225619 At points in the novel, Coverdale seems to practice mild voyeurism. He is a professed supporter of women's equality, as evidenced in an argument with Hollingsworth, although he also views Zenobia's feminism as a symptom of romantic disillusionment. He is typically mild-mannered, though often strange and illogical. He is consistently curious about his surroundings, leading to his voyeurism and mostly unsupported speculations on his fellow residents. Though he seems to fancy Zenobia and certainly regards her as beautiful, in the last line of the story he confesses that he is truly in love with Priscilla. However, critics often identify a strongly homoerotic relationship between Coverdale and Hollingsworth.Berlant, Lauren. ‚ÄúFantasies of Utopia in The Blithedale Romance‚Äù. American Literary History Spring 1989 https://www.jstor.org/stable/489970 Old Moodie: Though introduced as Old Moodie, he was formerly known as Fauntleroy, a wealthy but immoral man who loses his riches in a financial scandal. He is separated from his beautiful wife and daughter and disowned by the rest of his family. Years later, poorer and wiser, he remarries and has a second daughter. Coverdale uses him to discover the backgrounds of Zenobia and Priscilla, who are his two daughters. The Veiled Lady: She is a mystical character, first introduced as a public curiosity, who suddenly disappears from the public's eye. Her story is developed in a type of ghost story narrated by Zenobia in a segment titled The Silvery Veil. She is said to have been held captive by the curse of the veil, a symbol which in Hawthorne's literature typically represents secret sin.Sloan, Elizabeth. The Treatment of the Supernatural in Poe and Hawthorne. Ithaca: Cornell, 1930. She is controlled by the magician Westervelt, and is eventually revealed to be Priscilla herself when Hollingsworth removes the veil. Hollingsworth: A philanthropist overly concerned with his own ideals, he comes to the farm with Priscilla having been told she has a place there. He becomes good friends with Coverdale during the other's sickness, but his attempts to recruit the other to his cause eventually cause enough tension for a split in the friendship. He believes in the reform of all sinners and attempts to use Blithedale and its residents to achieve these ends, instead of those supported by the group. He is rumored to have a relationship with Zenobia partway through the novel, and they plan on building a cottage together. However, he falls for Priscilla, saving her from the fate of the Veiled Lady, and breaks up with Zenobia, which causes her to commit suicide. Silas Foster: Coverdale describes him as ‚Äúlank, stalwart, uncouth, and grizzly-bearded.‚Äù He is the only resident that seems to be truly experienced in the art of farming. He is level-headed and sensible, and is the first to suggest Priscilla stay upon her arrival. He is one of the three men to search for and find Zenobia's body and, while displaying proper sadness and emotion, also accepts her death with the most ease. Mrs. Foster: She is first to welcome Coverdale to Blithedale, wife of Silas Foster. She manages the farm and plays only a small role in the novel. Zenobia: Beautiful and wealthy, she wears a different tropical flower in her hair every day. She is admired by both Hollingsworth and Coverdale, though both eventually fall for her sister Priscilla instead. Priscilla herself is also quite taken with the older woman and follows her around the farm. Zenobia's main vice is pride, and she has an unusual and unexplained prior relationship with Professor Westervelt. She is the daughter of Old Moodie's first, prosperous marriage when he was still referred to as Faunteleroy. She often is thought to be analogous to the author Margaret Fuller, who although not a resident of Brook Farm was a frequent visitor there.The Brook Farm Community www.age-of-the- sage.org/transcendentalism/brook_farm.html Priscilla: A fragile, mysterious girl brought to the farm by Hollingsworth. She makes intricate purses that Coverdale considers a ‚Äúsymbol of her mystery.‚Äù She is known to frequently pause as if responding to a call, though no other characters hear it. She becomes progressively more open and less frail throughout the novel and develops a strong attachment to Hollingsworth on top of her sisterly affections for Zenobia. She is eventually revealed to be the second daughter of Old Moodie, as well as the alter ego of the Veiled Lady. Hollingsworth frees her from the curse of the veil, and at the book's close, she remains attached to him. Professor Westervelt: Stumbles into the plot looking for Priscilla and Zenobia. Coverdale takes an immediate distaste to him and describes him with such language as one would describe the devil. In fact, much of the imagery Coverdale uses, such as the flames on Westervelt's pin and the serpent-headed staff he carries are direct references to Satan. He presumably has a former, possibly romantic, relationship with Zenobia. He is revealed to be the magician controlling Priscilla near the end of the book, and his last appearance is at Zenobia's funeral where he criticizes her foolish suicide. Contemporary and modern criticism Following its publication, The Blithedale Romance was received with little enthusiasm by contemporary critics. As one reviewer claims, the preface which is merely a disclaimer of sorts, \\"is by no means the least important part of it\\".\\"Christian Examiner\\" September 1852 In fact, to many reviews this simple, non-fictional disclaimer seems to be the most important part of the book. Many reviews refer to the preface of the novel and express skepticism in regard to Hawthorne's plea contained therein for the reader not to take the characters and occurrences of the novel as representative of real-life people and events. They claim that there is simply too much correlation between fiction and nonfiction. One reviewer states \\"so vividly does [Hawthorne] present to us the scheme at Brook Farm, to which some of our acquaintance were parties, so sharply and accurately does he portray some incidents of life there, that we are irresistibly impelled to fix the real names of men and women to the characters of his book\\".\\"Christian Examiner\\" September 1852 As such they read into what Hawthorne writes about characters that have associated real-life figures. However, other reviews, while stating that there is correlation between the fiction of the novel and reality, these correlations should not lead to association of fiction and non-fiction. One review states \\"we can recognize in the personages of his Romance individual traits of several real characters who were [at Brook Farm], but no one has his or her whole counterpart in one who was actually a member of the community. There was no actual Zenobia, Hollingsworth, or Priscilla there, and no such catastrophe as described ever occurred there\\".Brownson's Quarterly Review (October 1852) A great deal of modern criticism centers around the relation between fiction and non-fiction as well. Critics believe that when viewed as representative of Hawthorne's own life and beliefs, \\"The Blithedale Romance\\" provides insight into the mind of the author. According to critics, the novel can be seen as a reflection of the religious conflict Hawthorne faced throughout his life. Irving Howe summarizes this religious conflict, stating, \\"Throughout his life Hawthorne was caught up in what we would call a crisis of religious belief. His acute moral sense had been largely detached from the traditional context of orthodox faith, but it had found little else in which to thrive\\".Howe, Irving. Hawthorne: Pastoral and Politics in Ed. Gross, Seymour. \\"The Blithedale Romance\\". New York: Norton & Company, 1978. p. 288. Although Hawthorne did not agree with Puritan dogmas, Transcendentalists often associated morality with observance of these dogmas. The novel presents an ironic contradiction between the perception of morality and actual morality, such as the \\"Utopian\\" Blithedale filled with sin and far less than \\"moral\\" individuals. Critics claim, therefore that Blithedale is an attempt by Hawthorne to represent morality as independent from faith.Howe, Irving. Hawthorne: Pastoral and Politics in Ed. Gross, Seymour. \\"The Blithedale Romance\\". New York: Norton & Company, 1978. p. 289. In a broader sense, critics have long argued that the majority of the people, places, and events of The Blithedale Romance can be traced back to Hawthorne's observations and experiences over his lifetime.Male, Roy R. The Pastoral Wasteland in Ed. Gross, Seymour. The Blithedale Romance. New York: Norton & Company, 1978. p. 297. The most obvious of these correlations between fiction and reality is the similarity between Blithedale and Brook Farms, an actual experimental community in the 19th century of which Hawthorne was a part. In addition, the character of Coverdale is often associated with Hawthorne himself. However, according to critics this self-portrait is \\"a highly and mocking self- portrait, as if Hawthorne were trying to isolate and thereby exorcise everything within him that impedes full participation in life\\".Howe, Irving. \\"Hawthorne: Pastoral and Politics\\" in Ed. Gross, Seymour. The Blithedale Romance. New York: Norton & Company, 1978. p. 290. Critics have also argued for less obvious connections such as the connection between Zenobia and Margaret Fuller, a contemporary of Hawthorne.Male, Roy R. \\"The Pastoral Wasteland\\" in Ed. Gross, Seymour. The Blithedale Romance. New York: Norton & Company, 1978. p. 298. Context Nathaniel Hawthorne in the 1860s The Blithedale Romance is a work of fiction based on Hawthorne's recollections of Brook Farm,McFarland, Philip. Hawthorne in Concord. New York: Grove Press, 2004. p. 149. a short-lived agricultural and educational commune where Hawthorne lived from April to November 1841. The commune, an attempt at an intellectual utopian society, interested many famous Transcendentalists such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Margaret Fuller, though few of the Transcendentalists actually lived there. While neither of them agreed to participate in the social experiment by living at the farm, they often visited the community. The Brook Farm Community www.age-of-the- sage.org/transcendentalism/brook_farm.html In the novel's preface, Hawthorne describes his memories of this temporary home as \\"essentially a daydream, and yet a fact\\" which he employs as \\"an available foothold between fiction and reality.\\" His feelings of affectionate scepticism toward the commune are reflected not only in the novel, but also in his journal entries and in the numerous letters he wrote from Brook Farm to Sophia Peabody, his future wife. Hawthorne's claim that the novel's characters are \\"entirely fictitious\\" has been widely questioned. The character of Zenobia, for example, is said to have been modelled upon Margaret Fuller,Blanchard, Paula. Margaret Fuller: From Transcendentalism to Revolution. Reading, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 1987: 187. an acquaintance of Hawthorne and a frequent guest at Brook Farm. The circumstances of Zenobia's death, however, were not inspired by the shipwreck that ended Fuller's life but by the suicide of a certain Miss Martha Hunt, a refined but melancholy young woman who drowned herself in a river on the morning of July 9, 1845. Hawthorne helped to search for the body that night, and later recorded the incident at considerable length in his journal.Hawthorne, Nathaniel.

Symbols Flower: Zenobia wears a new exotic flower every day. It represents vitality, and all the other characters are focused on destroying it. Coverdale is always probing and investigating into her life. Hollingsworth uses her in his conspiracy to create an ideal society. Priscilla betrays her when she chooses Hollingsworth over her. Lastly Westervelt blackmails her. She ultimately destroys herself through suicide. The exotic flower is a symbol of her pride, life and vitality all of which the characters in the Blithedale Romance are set on destroying. Zenobia's main vice is pride; however it is why she is admired by all. Its physical representation is demonstrated through her exotic flower.Male, Roy R. Jr. \\"Toward the Waste Land: The theme of the Blithedale Romance\\" College English February 1955 https://www.jstor.org/stable/372340 Veil: The veil represents withdrawal and concealment. Priscilla, as the Veiled Lady, is private and hidden. The image of the veil appears with almost every character. Old Moodie with his alias and eye patch illustrates his use of concealment. Westervelt's gold teeth, Hollingsworth's philanthropic project are also examples of a withdrawal. Additionally, the whole community is withdrawn from society, as it is a secluded Utopian community. The veil is a constantly recurring theme throughout the novel. Concealment and withdrawal continually surface through all the characters.Male, Roy R. Jr. \\"Toward the Waste Land: The theme of the Blithedale Romance\\" College English February 1955 https://www.jstor.org/stable/372340 Spring/Fall: The novel starts in spring and ends in fall. Upon moving to Blithedale, Coverdale proclaims his own rebirth. Spring is full of warmth and hope, while fall is full of dark imagery. In spring, Coverdale recovers from his illness. In fall, it concludes with the mutilated, marbled, rigid corpse of Zenobia.Male, Roy R. Jr. \\"Toward the Waste Land: The theme of the Blithedale Romance\\" College English February 1955 https://www.jstor.org/stable/372340 Sickness: In the beginning of the novel, Coverdale becomes deathly ill and is bedridden. Hollingsworth cares for him and he returns to health. Priscilla is also sick and gradually regains her health as time elapses and she adjusts to Blithedale. As Roy R. Male Jr. wrote, ‚ÄúThis sickness is what the book is about.‚Äù Coverdale's mental state also changes throughout the novel. Upon his return he emphasizes that there is a, \\"Sickness of the spirits [which] kept alternating with my flights of causeless buoyancy\\"Male, Roy R. Jr. \\"Toward the Waste Land: The theme of the Blithedale Romance\\" College English February 1955 https://www.jstor.org/stable/372340 Dreams: The dream of building a Utopian Society is just one of the dreams in the novel. As Daniel Hoffman wrote, \\"Whether Miles Coverdale is reporting what he has actually seen and heard, or what he has dreamed. Parts of the book indeed seem to rely on, to create, a stream-of-consciousness narration\\" Coverdale's dreams reveal his discovery and continued repression of his sexual desire of Zenobia.Ross, Donald. \\"Dreams and Sexual Repression in the Blithedale Romance\\" PMLA October 1971 https://www.jstor.org/stable/461086 There are dreams created in his imagination and memory, as well as the dreams in his sleep. All of which include the veil and mask imagery that recur in the novel.Griffith, Kelley. \\"Form in The Blithedale Romance\\" American Literature March 1968 https://www.jstor.org/stable/2923695 Style The novel is written from a first-person limited point of view and the narrator is Miles Coverdale. Coverdale's narrative style is erratic and dreamlike, bringing a strange form of syntax to the novel that is more Coverdale's than Hawthorne's.Griffith, Kelley. \\"Form in The Blithedale Romance\\" American Literature March 1968 https://www.jstor.org/stable/2923695 In a final chapter added after the original manuscript was completed but before publishing, Coverdale breaks the fourth wall and reveals that the writing takes place significantly after leaving Blithedale. He reveals the fates of the other characters from a still limited viewpoint. The title identifies the novel as a romance, probably of the dark romantic type as Hawthorne (along with Edgar Allan Poe and Herman Melville) was considered a dark romantic writer. It displays the characteristic symbolism of Satan, magic and the supernatural frequently used in dark romantic literature. Themes of sin, guilt, and the betterment of humanity also appear in the novel through symbols like the veil and Blithedale itself. These too are indicators of the book's Transcendentalist background and romantic nature.

Koreans began immigrating in larger numbers in the 1960s and found housing in the Mid- Wilshire area. Many opened businesses as they found rent and tolerance toward the growing Korean population. Many of the historic Art deco buildings with terra cotta fa√ßades have been preserved because the buildings remained economically viable for the new businesses.Hawthorne, Christopher (November 29, 2014) \\"KOREATOWN'S COOL OLD BUILDINGS POINT TO L.A.'S FUTURE\\" Los Angeles Times (online). Despite the name evoking a traditional ethnic enclave, the community is complex and has an impact on areas outside the traditional boundaries. While the neighborhood culture historically was oriented to the Korean immigrant population, Korean business owners are creating stronger ties to the Latino community in Koreatown. The community is highly diverse ethnically, with half the residents being Latino and a third being Asian. Two- thirds of the residents were born outside of the United States, a high figure compared to the rest of the city. History= 1900s‚Äì1980s  In 1882, the United States and Korea established the United States-Korea Treaty of 1882, which ended Korea's self-imposed isolation. The establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and Korea paved the way for Korean immigration to Hawaii in the late 1880s. In the early 1900s, Korean immigrants began making their way to Los Angeles, where they created communities based around ethnic churches. As the number of Koreans increased to the hundreds, their residential and commercial activities spread to the southwestern corner of the Los Angeles business district, putting them within walking distance of Little Tokyo and Chinatown. By the 1930s, approximately 650 Koreans resided in Los Angeles. They established churches, restaurants, and community organizations, as well as businesses that primarily focused on vegetable and fruit distribution. In 1936, the Korean National Association, one of the largest Korean immigrant political organizations, moved its central headquarters from San Francisco to Los Angeles to continue promoting political, cultural, educational, and religious activities. However, racial covenant laws and economic constraints limited Korean residents to an area bounded by Adams Boulevard to the north, Slauson Avenue to the south, Western Avenue to the west, and Vermont Avenue to the east. The 1930s also saw the height of the area's association with Hollywood. The Ambassador Hotel hosted the Academy Awards ceremony in 1930, 1931, 1932, and 1934. As the entertainment industry grew in the surrounding Koreatown area, Koreans remained segregated into low-income districts because of discriminatory housing policies. After the 1948 Shelley v. Kraemer Supreme Court case prohibited racially restrictive housing policies, Koreans began to move north of Olympic Boulevard to establish new homes and businesses. In the late 1960s, the surrounding neighborhood began to enter a steep economic decline. The once-glamorous mid-Wilshire area became filled with vacant commercial and office space that attracted wealthier South Korean immigrants. They found inexpensive housing and many opened businesses in Koreatown. Many of the area's Art Deco buildings with terracotta facades were preserved because they remained economically viable with the new commercial activity that occupied them. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 removed restrictions on Asian migration and helped further the growth of the immigrant community in Koreatown. By the late 1970s, most businesses in the Olympic Boulevard and 8th Street areas were owned by Koreans. This economic boom led to the creation of Korean media outlets and community organizations, which played a key role in developing a sense of communal identity in the neighborhood. The ethnic enclave was able to establish itself as the primary hub of the Korean community in Southern California, and the residents successfully lobbied for the installation of the first Koreatown sign in 1982.  1992 Los Angeles riots  The 1992 Los Angeles riots had a significant impact on the community, solidifying the importance of community-based nonprofit organizations, such as the Koreatown Youth and Community Center (KYCC) and Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance (KIWA) (see Community Organizations section) (Chung, 2005). These organizations advocated for reparations and protections for Korean Americans, who received little support from government authorities as a result of their low social status and language barrier. During the time of the riots, Black and Korean Americans were facing racial strife. In many predominantly Black neighborhoods, Korean citizens owned the majority of businesses. When white residents left the area, Koreans purchased their businesses from them for little money. Rapper Ice Cube spoke of this, along with Asian suspicion of Black residents in his 1991 album \\"Death Certificate\\" during the song \\"Black Korea\\". On March 16, 1991, a Korean store owner, Soon Ja Du, shot and killed a 15-year-old, black customer, Latasha Harlins. Du accused Harlins of stealing orange juice, and after watching her slamming down the jug and turning to leave, shot her in the head. Some historians view Du's posting bail as the breaking point in tensions. The 1992 unrest stimulated a new wave of political activism among Korean-Americans, but also split them into two camps. The liberals sought to unite with other minorities in Los Angeles to fight against racial oppression and scapegoating. The conservatives emphasized law and order and generally favored the economic and social policies of the Republican Party. The conservatives also tended to emphasize the political differences between Koreans and other minorities, specifically Blacks and Hispanics.Edward J.W. Park, \\"Competing visions: Political formation of Korean Americans in Los Angeles, 1992-1997\\" Amerasia Journal, 1998, Vol. 24 Issue 1, pp 41-57Nancy Abelmann and John Lie, Blue dreams: Korean Americans and the Los Angeles riots (1997) Despite this divide within the Korean American community, the 1992 riots also inspired further efforts to build coalitions rooted in intersectionality. The 1992 Koreatown Peace Rally was a record-setting demonstration with over 30,000 attendees representing intergenerational and interethnic solidarity. The week long rioting destroyed much of Koreatown. There was $50 million worth of damage done in LA, half of which was on Korean-owned businesses. During the riots, roads between Koreatown and safer neighborhoods were blocked off. Some Korean- Americans speculated that they were being trapped in the danger. One resident said, \\"It was containment. The police cut off traffic out of Koreatown, while we were trapped on the other side without help. Those roads are a gateway to a richer neighborhood. It can't be denied.\\" Many Korean Americans who survived the riot have argued that this showed that people of minority races and ethnicities must group together for protection from a system that does not protect non-white citizens with the commitment or vigor given to white citizens. An 18-year-old Korean American, Edward Song Lee, and his three friends went to protect a Korean-owned pizza shop. Lee was accidentally shot to death by Korean shopkeepers who mistook him and his friends as rioters. Hyungwon Kang captured a photograph of Lee's body in the street. Korean civilians felt that police did not protect them and that emergency responders did not respond to their calls for help. The effects of the riots, which displaced Korean Americans and destroyed their sources of income, combined with little aid having been given to those who suffered, are still being felt today as LA-based Koreans continue to struggle with poverty.  2000s‚Äìpresent  In late 2008, the City of Los Angeles designated Koreatown a special graphics district (along with Hollywood and the downtown neighborhood of South Park/LA Live). The designation allows for digital signage and electronic billboards, not permitted by city code, to be installed on building facades. The designation allowed Times Square and Shibuya District-inspired buildings lined with LCD jumbotrons. The 300-square block graphics district is bordered by 6th Street and Olympic Boulevard from the north and south, and St. Andrews Place and Shatto from the west to east. Koreatown has become a commercially driven area, yet continues to face pressing social and economic problems, including poverty and gentrification. The controversial construction of the Robert F. Kennedy Community Schools at the former site of the Ambassador Hotel highlighted the challenge of balancing resource expansion with business development and historic preservation. The schools were constructed with the intention of increasing educational opportunities for low-income Latina/Latino and Korean students, but the $578 million construction cost made the complex the most expensive public school in United States history. By 2020, Koreatown was \\"known for having one of the largest concentrations of nightclubs and 24-hour businesses and restaurants in the country. Other developments, such as the opening of new metro stations, shopping centers, and strip malls, have made Koreatown a popular tourist destination while also increasing economic inequality for locals. Protests against and in favor of building a homeless shelter took place in 2020. Since Koreatown has a Latino majority, it's not unusual to find Latino employees in restaurants and grocery stores speaking Korean with customers or Korean store owners engaging Latino customers in Spanish. An example of a cultural interchange between Koreans and Latinos in Koreatown is the popularity of Korean-inspired taco trucks in Los Angeles that feature classic Mexican food infused with Korean ingredients.

But the area extends south as Olympic Boulevard and north to 3rd Street, with spillover into adjacent Westlake and Hancock Park.  The beginnings of Koreatown  In the early 1900s, Koreans clustered around the downtown Los Angeles Bunker Hill area. This housing segregation was due to racial covenant laws that restricted them to mixed-race, low-income districts. By the 1930s, Koreans began to move to Jefferson Boulevard between Western and Vermont Avenue. The next major shift began in the 1960s. As the African American population increased in southern Los Angeles, middle-class White Americans began to move out of the mid- Wilshire district. The area north of Olympic Boulevard transitioned from a predominantly white suburb to a home for Asian residents. The area has become the mainstay of the Korean American community, although varying sources have established different boundaries for Koreatown. In 1980, the neighborhood of Koreatown was officially designated by Los Angeles.https://la.curbed.com/2019/5/6/18523959/koreatown-los-angeles- guelaguetza-riots City of Los Angeles boundaries The city of Los Angeles has set the official boundaries for Koreatown as Vermont Avenue on the east, Western Avenue on the west, Third Street on the north, and Olympic Boulevard on the south.

Demographics 6th Street at KenmoreKoreatown is one of the densest neighborhoods in the United States. The 2000 U.S. census counted 115,070 residents in the 2.7-square-mile neighborhood‚Äîan average of 42,611 people per square mile, the highest density of any community in Los Angeles County. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 124,281. The median age for residents was 30, an average age for both the city and Los Angeles County. Koreatown is considered \\"highly diverse\\" ethnically. The breakdown is Latinos, 53.5%; Asians, 32.2%; whites, 7.4%; blacks, 4.8%, and others, 2%. Korea (28.6%) and Mexico (23.9%) were the most common places of birth for the 68% of the residents who were born abroad, a figure that is considered high compared to the city as a whole. The median annual household income in 2008 dollars was $30,558, a low figure for Los Angeles, and the percentage of households that earned less than $20,000 was high. The average household size of 2.7 people was about the same as the rest of the city. Renters occupied 93% of the housing units, and house- or apartment owners the rest. In 2020, approximately 600 residents were unhoused. The percentages of never-married men and women, 44.6% and 36.2%, respectively, were among the county's highest. There were 2,833 military veterans in 2000, or 3.3%, a low figure for Los Angeles. Economy Olympic Boulevard has blocks dominated by Korean-language signs and new blue-tile-roofed shopping centers. This initial Korean business area has spread to an area bounded by Olympic Boulevard, Vermont Avenue, 8th Street and Western Avenue.

The project monitors a geographically distributed network of hardware random number generators in a bid to identify anomalous outputs that correlate with widespread emotional responses to sets of world events, or periods of focused attention by large numbers of people. The GCP is privately funded through the Institute of Noetic Sciences and describes itself as an international collaboration of about 100 research scientists and engineers. Skeptics such as Robert T. Carroll, Claus Larsen, and others have questioned the methodology of the Global Consciousness Project, particularly how the data are selected and interpreted, saying the data anomalies reported by the project are the result of \\"pattern matching\\" and selection bias which ultimately fail to support a belief in psi or global consciousness. Other critics have stated that the open access to the test data \\"is a testimony to the integrity and curiosity of those involved\\". But in analyzing the data for 11 September 2001, May et al. concluded that the statistically significant result given by the published GCP hypothesis was fortuitous, and found that as far as this particular event was concerned an alternative method of analysis gave only chance deviations throughout. Background Roger D. Nelson developed the project as an extrapolation of two decades of experiments from the controversial Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab (PEAR). In an extension of the laboratory research utilizing hardware random number generators called FieldREG, investigators examined the outputs of REGs in the field before, during and after highly focused or coherent group events. The group events studied included psychotherapy sessions, theater presentations, religious rituals, sports competitions such as the Football World Cup, and television broadcasts such as the Academy Awards.Bierman, 1996; Blasband, 2000; Nelson, 1995, 1997; Nelson et al., 1996, 1998a, 1998b; Radin, 1997; Radin et al., 1996. FieldREG was extended to global dimensions in studies looking at data from 12 independent REGs in the US and Europe during a web-promoted \\"Gaiamind Meditation\\" in January 1997, and then again in September 1997 after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. The project claimed the results suggested it would be worthwhile to build a permanent network of continuously-running REGs. This became the EGG project or Global Consciousness Project. Comparing the GCP to PEAR, Nelson, referring to the \\"field\\" studies with REGs done by PEAR, said the GCP used \\"exactly the same procedure... applied on a broader scale.\\" Methodology The GCP's methodology is based on the hypothesis that events which elicit widespread emotion or draw the simultaneous attention of large numbers of people may affect the output of hardware random number generators in a statistically significant way. The GCP maintains a network of hardware random number generators which are interfaced to computers at 70 locations around the world. Custom software reads the output of the random number generators and records a trial (sum of 200 bits) once every second. The data are sent to a server in Princeton, creating a database of synchronized parallel sequences of random numbers. The GCP is run as a replication experiment, essentially combining the results of many distinct tests of the hypothesis. The hypothesis is tested by calculating the extent of data fluctuations at the time of events. The procedure is specified by a three-step experimental protocol. In the first step, the event duration and the calculation algorithm are pre-specified and entered into a formal registry. In the second step, the event data are extracted from the database and a Z score, which indicates the degree of deviation from the null hypothesis, is calculated from the pre-specified algorithm. In the third step, the event Z-score is combined with the Z-scores from previous events to yield an overall result for the experiment. The remote devices have been dubbed Princeton Eggs, a reference to the coinage electrogaiagram, a portmanteau of electroencephalogram and Gaia. Supporters and skeptics have referred to the aim of the GCP as being analogous to detecting \\"a great disturbance in the Force.\\" Claims and criticism of effects from the September 11 terrorist attacks The GCP has suggested that changes in the level of randomness may have occurred during the September 11, 2001 attacks when the planes first impacted, as well as, the two days following the attacks. Independent scientists Edwin May and James Spottiswoode conducted an analysis of the data around the September 11 attacks and concluded there was no statistically significant change in the randomness of the GCP data during the attacks and the apparent significant deviation reported by Nelson and Radin existed only in their chosen time window. Spikes and fluctuations are to be expected in any random distribution of data, and there is no set time frame for how close a spike has to be to a given event for the GCP to say they have found a correlation. Wolcotte Smith said \\"A couple of additional statistical adjustments would have to be made to determine if there really was a spike in the numbers,\\" referencing the data related to September 11, 2001. Similarly, Jeffrey D. Scargle believes unless both Bayesian and classical p-value analysis agree and both show the same anomalous effects, the kind of result GCP proposes will not be generally accepted. In 2003, a New York Times article concluded \\"All things considered at this point, the stock market seems a more reliable gauge of the national‚Äîif not the global‚Äîemotional resonance.\\" In 2007 The Age reported that \\"[Nelson] concedes the data, so far, is not solid enough for global consciousness to be said to exist at all. It is not possible, for example, to look at the data and predict with any accuracy what (if anything) the eggs may be responding to.\\" Robert Matthews said that while it was \\"the most sophisticated attempt yet\\" to prove psychokinesis existed, the unreliability of significant events to cause statistically significant spikes meant that \\"the only conclusion to emerge from the Global Consciousness Project so far is that data without a theory is as meaningless as words without a narrative\\".

Following the German and Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939, Polish Jews were targeted from the outset. Within months inside occupied Poland, the Germans created hundreds of ghettos in which they forced the Jews to live. The new ghettos were part of the German official policy of removing Jews from public life with the aim of economic exploitation. The combination of excess numbers of inmates, unsanitary conditions and lack of food resulted in a high death rate among them. In most cities the Jewish underground resistance movements developed almost instantly, although ghettoization had severely limited their access to resources. The ghetto fighters took up arms during the most deadly phase of the Holocaust known as Operation Reinhard (launched in 1942), against the Nazi plans to deport all prisoners ‚Äì men, women and children ‚Äì to camps, with the aim of their mass extermination. History Armed resistance was offered in over 100 locations on either side of Polish-Soviet border of 1939, overwhelmingly in eastern Poland. Some of these uprisings were more massive and organized, while others were small and spontaneous. The best known and the biggest of all Jewish uprisings during the Holocaust took place in the Warsaw Ghetto between 19 April and 16 May 1943, and in Bia≈Çystok in August. In the course of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising 56,065 Jews were either killed on the spot or captured and transported aboard Holocaust trains to extermination camps before the Ghetto was razed to the ground. At the Bia≈Çystok Ghetto, following deportations in which 10,000 Jews were led to the Holocaust trains and another 2,000 were murdered locally, the ghetto underground staged an uprising resulting in a blockade of the ghetto which lasted for a full month. There were other such struggles leading to the wholesale burning of the ghettos such as in Ko≈Çomyja (now Kolomyia, Ukraine), and mass shootings of women and children as in Mizocz.Eve Nussbaum Soumerai, Carol D.

It is home to the NoHo Arts District and the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, and it has seven public and eight private schools. There is a municipal park and a recreation center. The neighborhood is an important transportation center for the region. North Hollywood was established by the Lankershim Ranch Land and Water Company in 1887. It was first named Toluca before being renamed Lankershim in 1896 and finally North Hollywood in 1927. Demographics The 2000 U.S. census counted 77,848 residents in the 5.87-square-mile North Hollywood neighborhood‚Äîor 13,264 people per square mile, about an average population density for the city but among the highest for the county. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 87,241. In 2000 the median age for residents was 30, considered an average age for city and county neighborhoods; the percentage of residents aged 19 to 34 was among the county's highest. The neighborhood was considered \\"moderately diverse\\" ethnically within Los Angeles. The breakdown was 57.7% Latino, 27% Non-Hispanic White, 5.7% Asian, 5.6 % black, and 4% from other groups. Foreign-born residents made up 46.4% of residents, a high percentage for Los Angeles; Mexico (43.2%) and El Salvador (16%) were the most common places of birth for this portion of the population. The percentages of never-married men and never-married women were among the county's highest. The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $42,791, considered average for the city but low for the county. The percentages of households that earned $40,000 or less were high for the county. Renters occupied 75.4% of the housing stock, and house- or apartment- owners held 24.6%. Geography North Hollywood is bordered on the north by Sun Valley and on the northeast and east by Burbank. Toluca Lake borders North Hollywood on the southeast and south, and Studio City abuts it on the southwest. It is flanked by Valley Village and Valley Glen on the west. North Hollywood is not contiguous with Hollywood, being separated by other parts of the San Fernando Valley and the Hollywood Hills. North Hollywood displays a hot summer Mediterranean Climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Csa). History Lankershim Ranch Land and Water Company, 1887 Before annexation North Hollywood was once part of the vast landholdings of the Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa√±a, which was confiscated by the government during the Mexican period of rule. A group of investors assembled as the San Fernando Farm Homestead Association purchased the southern half of the Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando. The leading investor was Isaac Lankershim, a Northern California stockman and grain farmer, who was impressed by the Valley's wild oats and proposed to raise sheep on the property. In 1873, Isaac Lankershim's son and future son-in-law, James Boon Lankershim and Isaac Newton Van Nuys, moved to the San Fernando Valley and took over management of the property. Van Nuys thought the property could profitably grow wheat using the dryland farming technique developed on the Great Plains and leased land from the Association to test his theories. In time, the Lankershim property, under its third name, the Los Angeles Farming and Milling Company, would become the world's largest wheat-growing empire.Link 1991, p.27Roderick 2001, pp. 32‚Äì34, 44‚Äì45 In October 1887, J.B. Lankershim and eight other developers organized the Lankershim Ranch Land and Water Company, purchasing north of the Cahuenga Pass from the Lankershim Farming and Milling Company.Link 1991, p. 31 Lankershim established a townsite which the residents named Toluca along the old road from Cahuenga Pass to San Fernando. On April 1, 1888, they offered ready-made small farms for sale, already planted with deep-rooted deciduous fruit and nut trees‚Äîmostly peaches, pears, apricots, and walnuts‚Äîthat could survive the rainless summers of the Valley by relying on the high water table along the Tujunga Wash rather than surface irrigation.Jorgenson 1982, p. 82Link 1991, pp. 31, 33 Lankershim School, located near what is now the intersection of Vineland and Riverside, and the first school in the San Fernando Valley, c. 1889 The land boom of the 1880s went bust by the 1890s, but despite another brutal drought cycle in the late 1890s, the fruit and nut farmers remained solvent. The Toluca Fruit Growers Association was formed in 1894. The next year the Southern Pacific opened a branch line slanting northwest across the Valley to Chatsworth. The Chatsworth Limited made one freight stop a day at Toluca, though the depot bore the new name of Lankershim. With the post office across the street being called Toluca, controversy over the town's name continued, and the local ranchers used to quip, \\"Ship the merchandise to Lankershim, but bill it to Toluca.\\" In 1896, under pressure from Lankershim, the post office at Toluca was renamed \\"Lankershim\\" after his father, although the new name of the town would not be officially recognized until 1905.Link 1991, pp. 34‚Äì35Roderick 2001. p. 46 By 1903, the area was known as \\"The Home of the Peach\\". In 1912, the area's major employer, the Bonner Fruit Company, was canning over a million tons of peaches, apricots, and other fruits.Bearchell and Fried 1988, p. 124 When the Los Angeles Aqueduct opened in 1913, Valley farmers offered to buy the surplus water, but the federal legislation that enabled the construction of the aqueduct prohibited Los Angeles from selling the water outside of the city limits.Bearchell and Fried 1988, p. 121 At first, resistance to the real- estate development and downtown business interests of Los Angeles remained strong enough to keep the small farmers unified in opposition to annexation. However, the fruit packing company interests were taken over by the Los Angeles interests. The two conspired to decrease prices and mitigate the farmers' profit margins, making their continued existence tenuous. When droughts hit the valley again, rather than face foreclosure, the most vulnerable farmers agreed to mortgage their holdings to the fruit packing company and banks in Los Angeles for the immediate future and vote on annexation. After annexation Circus Liquor, landmark sign dating from 1959 West Lankershim (more or less today's Valley Village) agreed to be annexed to the City of Los Angeles in 1919. Lankershim proper joined in 1923.Roderick 2001, p. 62‚Äì63 Much of the promised water delivery was withheld, and many of the ranchers one by one had their holding foreclosed or transferred to the packing companies. In turn, these were bought up by the real-estate developers and by the late 1920s a massive effort was underway to market the area to prospective home owners throughout the country. As part of this effort, in 1927, in an effort to capitalize on the glamour and proximity of Hollywood, Lankershim was renamed \\"North Hollywood\\". The result was a massive development of housing which transformed the area into a suburban development of Los Angeles. Valley Plaza and Laurel Plaza In the late 1940s and 1950s the area saw the first department-store-anchored, auto- oriented shopping center in the Valley: Valley Plaza, covering both a development at Laurel Canyon at Victory boulevards but also a loose collection of other retail stores south along Laurel Canyon to Oxnard, including a branch of the May Co., the second-largest suburban department store branch in the U.S. at the time. In the mid-1950s Valley Plaza claimed to be the largest shopping center on the West Coast of the United States and the third-largest in the country. The May Co. at the south end of the Valley Plaza shopping district built its own attached, enclosed mall, Laurel Plaza, opening in 1968. Alternate Link via ProQuest. The last department of Valley Plaza's anchors, Sears, closed in 2019 as department store-anchored shopping centers lost favor. As of 2020, much of the Valley Plaza retail space is either empty, portion is now a middle school, and the Laurel Plaza site is under construction to become NOHO West, a mixed-use development including retail. https://www.dailynews.com/regal-cinemas-24-hour-fitness-and-old-navy-headed- to-noho-west-project-at-former-laurel-plaza-shopping-center \\"Downtown\\" (Lankershim shopping district) Lankershim Blvd. around Magnolia Blvd. was the heart of the town of Lankershim and of North Hollywood and until the mid-1950s boasted the largest concentration of retail stores, banks, restaurants, and entertainment. In 1953, for example, the shopping strip included three full-line department stores: J.C. Penney at 5261 Lankershim, Yeakel & Goss department store at 5272, and the upscale single-location Rathbun's department store at nos. 5307‚Äì15. There were also branches of the large Harris & Frank clothing chain at 5236 Lankershim, J. J. Newberry five and dime at 5321, and Safeway at 5356.\\"Christmas Gift Ideas\\", supplement to the Valley Times, December 3, 1953 But nearby Valley Plaza shopping center, designed for accessibility by car with plenty of free parking, opened in 1951 and kept growing until by 1956 it claimed to be the third-largest shopping center in the country. It was difficult for the Lankershim retail district to compete and by 1980, most stores had closed including iconic Rathbun's. Changing demographics By the late 1950s, many of the original owners were aging, and their children were moving to other areas. School integration in the subsequent years, blockbusting, and subsequent ethnic turmoil encouraged many remaining families to move out, who in turn were replaced with black and Hispanic families moving from the downtown areas. By the 1990s, the demographic changes had almost completely transformed the region. 1990s The North Hollywood shootout occurred in 1997, leaving 12 Los Angeles Police Department officers and eight civilians injured and the two armed robbers dead. Renovation The opening of North Hollywood station in 2000, establishment and success of the NoHo Arts District in the old \\"downtown\\", and repurposing of disused lots such as Laurel Plaza into NOHO West, has revitalized the heart of North Hollywood. 21st century High-density property development in \\"NoHo\\" Since 2000, the community has been developing and undergoing many changes, thanks in large part to the formation of the 743-acre North Hollywood Development District and the subsequent NoHo Commons projects. In 2015, Lankershim Boulevard in North Hollywood was part of the first San Fernando Valley CicLAvia, an event sponsored by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority in which major roads are temporarily closed to motorized vehicle traffic and used for recreational human-powered transport. Attractions The Idle Hour Cafe on Vineland Ave. North Hollywood is home to the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences. Pierce Brothers Valhalla Memorial Park is located in the area, and includes the Portal of the Folded Wings Shrine to Aviation.

Transportation LA Metro station North Hollywood Pacific Electric Car Station, 1919 The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission approved the construction of the subway connecting North Hollywood to Hollywood, East Hollywood, Koreatown, Westlake and downtown Los Angeles along the Metro Rail Red Line in 1990. The decision followed the Los Angeles City Council unanimously endorsing North Hollywood as the northern terminal of the Red Line with the final route having termini at Union Station and North Hollywood. The North Hollywood Metro Subway station opened in June 2000. Close to half a million people took advantage of free rides on the Red Line subway in its first weekend in operation. The station is the starting point for the B Line of the Metro subway, which cost $4.5 billion to build. Instead of a further B Line extension further into the Valley, Metro built the Metro G Line bus rapid transit. Its terminus is located across the street from the subway station. This expanded the station area into a transit hub, and many local and rapid buses now stop at the station. Proposals have been made to extend the B Line northeasterly to Bob Hope Airport in Burbank and the Burbank Metrolink station in central Burbank, or to extend it in a northwesterly direction along Lankershim Boulevard and eventually to Sylmar. Neither project is currently funded nor is in Metro's Long Term Transportation Plan.

A glucoside is a glycoside that is derived from glucose. Glucosides are common in plants, but rare in animals. Glucose is produced when a glucoside is hydrolysed by purely chemical means, or decomposed by fermentation or enzymes. The name was originally given to plant products of this nature, in which the other part of the molecule was, in the greater number of cases, an aromatic aldehydic or phenolic compound (exceptions are sinigrin and jalapin or scammonin). It has now been extended to include synthetic ethers, such as those obtained by acting on alcoholic glucose solutions with hydrochloric acid, and also the polysaccharoses, e.g. cane sugar, which appear to be ethers also. Although glucose is the most common sugar present in glucosides, many are known which yield rhamnose or iso- dulcite; these may be termed pentosides. Much attention has been given to the non-sugar parts (aglyca) of the molecules; the constitutions of many have been determined, and the compounds synthesized; and in some cases the preparation of the synthetic glucoside effected. The simplest glucosides are the alkyl ethers which have been obtained by reacting hydrochloric acid on alcoholic glucose solutions. A better method of preparation is to dissolve solid anhydrous glucose in methanol containing hydrochloric acid. A mixture of alpha- and beta-methylglucoside results. Classification of the glucosides is a matter of some intricacy. One method based on the chemical constitution of the non-glucose part of the molecules has been proposed that posits four groups: (I) alkyl derivatives, (2) benzene derivatives, (3) styrolene derivatives, and (4) anthracene derivatives. A group may also be constructed to include the cyanogenic glucosides, i.e. those containing prussic acid. Alternate classifications follow a botanical classification, which has several advantages; in particular, plants of allied genera contain similar compounds. In this article the chemical classification will be followed, and only the more important compounds will be discussed herein.  Ethylene derivatives  These are generally mustard oils, which are characterized by a burning taste; their principal occurrence is in mustard and Tropaeolum seeds. Sinigrin, or the potassium salt of inyronic acid not only occurs in mustard seed, but also in black pepper and in horseradish root. Hydrolysis with baryta, or decomposition by the ferment myrosin, gives glucose, allyl mustard oil and potassium hydrogen sulfate. Sinalbin occurs in white pepper; it decomposes to the mustard oil, glucose and sinapin, a compound of choline and sinapic acid. Jalapin or scammonin occurs in scammony; it hydrolyses to glucose and jalapinolic acid.  Benzene derivatives  These are generally oxy and oxyaldehydic compounds. ; Benzoic acid derivatives The benzoyl derivative cellotropin has been used for tuberculosis. Populin, which occurs in the leaves and bark of Populus tremula, is benzoyl salicin. Benzoyl-beta-D- glucoside is a compound found in Pteris ensiformis. ;Phenol derivatives There are a number of glucosides found in natural phenols and polyphenols, as, for example, in the flavonoids chemical family. Arbutin, which occurs in bearberry along with methyl arbutin, hydrolyses to hydroquinone and glucose. Pharmacologically it acts as a urinary antiseptic and diuretic; Salicin, also termed saligenin and glucose occurs in the willow. The enzymes ptyalin and emulsin convert it into glucose and saligenin, ortho-oxybenzylalcohol. Oxidation gives the aldehyde helicin.  Styrolene derivatives  This group contains a benzene and also an ethylene group, being derived from styrolene. Coniferin, C16H22O8, occurs in the cambium of conifer wood. Emulsin converts it into glucose and coniferyl alcohol, while oxidation gives glycovanillin, which yields with emulsin, glucose and vanillin. Syringin, which occurs in the bark of Syringa vulgaris, is a methoxyconiferin. Phloridzus occurs in the root-bark of various fruit trees; it hydrolyses to glucose and phloretin, which is the phloroglucin ester of paraoxyhydratropic acid. It is related to the pentosides naringin, C27H32O14, which hydrolyses to rhamnose and naringenin, the phioroglucin ester of para-oxycinnamic acid, and hesperidin, which hydrolyses to rhamnose and hesperetin, the phloroglucin ester of meta- oxy-para-methoxycinnamic acid or isoferulic acid, C10H10O4. * Aesculin (C21H24O13), occurring in horse-chestnut and California buckeye, and daphnin, occurring in Daphne alpina, are isomeric; the former hydrolyses to glucose and aesculetin (C9H6O4 ‚Äî 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin), the latter to glucose and daphnetin (7,8-dihydroxycoumarin). * Fraxin, occurring in Fraxinus excelsior, and with aesculin, hydrolyses to glucose and fraxetin, 7,8-dihydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin. * Flavone or benzo-7-pyrone derivatives are numerous; in many cases they (or the non-sugar part of the molecule) are vegetable dyes. * Quercitrin is a yellow dyestuff found in Quercus velutina; it hydrolyses to rhamnose and quercetin, a dioxy-~3-phenyl-trioxybenzoy- pyrone. * Rhamnetin, a splitting product of the glucosides of Rhamnus, is monomethyl quercetin; fisetin, from Rhus cotinus, is monoxyquercetin; chrysin is phenyl-dioxybenzo-y-pyrone. * Saponarin, a glucoside found in Saponaria officinalis, is a related compound. * Strophanthin is the name given to two different compounds, g-strophanthin (ouabain) obtained from Strophanthus gratus and k-strophanthin from Stroph. komb√©.  Anthracene derivatives  These are generally substituted anthraquinones; many have medicinal applications, being used as purgatives, while one, ruberythric acid, yields the valuable dyestuff madder, the base of which is alizarin. Chrysophanic acid, a dioxymethylanthraquinone, occurs in rhubarb, which also contains emodin, a trioxymethylanthraquinone; this substance occurs in combination with rhamnose in Frangula bark. The most important cyanogenic glucoside is amygdalin, which occurs in bitter almonds. The enzyme maltase decomposes it into glucose and mandelic nitrile glucoside; the latter is broken down by emulsin into glucose, benzaldehyde and prussic acid. Emulsin also decomposes amygdalin directly into these compounds without the intermediate formation of mandelic nitrile glucoside. Several other glucosides of this nature have been isolated. The saponins are a group of substances characterized by forming a lather with water; they occur in soap-bark. Mention may also be made of indican, the glucoside of the indigo plant; this is hydrolysed by the indigo ferment, indimulsiri, to indoxyl and indiglucin.

He is most widely known for the theory that dinosaurs were killed by an asteroid impact, developed in collaboration with his father, Nobel Prize winning physicist Luis Alvarez. Biography Born in Berkeley, California, Alvarez is the son of Luis Walter Alvarez, a Nobel prize-winner in physics. His grandfather was the famed physician Walter C. Alvarez and his great- grandfather, Spanish-born Luis F. Alvarez, worked as a doctor in Hawaii and developed a method for the better diagnosis of macular leprosy. His great-aunt Mabel Alvarez was a noted California artist and oil painter. Alvarez earned his B.A. in geology in 1962 from Carleton College in Minnesota and Ph.D. in geology from Princeton University in 1967. He worked for American Overseas Petroleum Limited in the Netherlands, and in Libya at the time of Colonel Gadaffi's revolution. Having developed a side interest in archaeological geology, he left the oil company and spent some time in Italy, studying the Roman volcanics and their influence on patterns of settlement in early Roman times. Alvarez then moved to Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory of Columbia University, and began studying the Mediterranean tectonics in the light of the new theory of plate tectonics. His work on tectonic paleomagnetism in Italy led to a study of the geomagnetic reversals recorded in Italian deep-sea limestones. Alvarez and his colleagues were able to date the reversals for an interval of more than 100 million years of the Earth's history by using Foraminifera biostratigraphy. Impact theory Walter Alvarez at the original site where he discovered the dinosaur extinction evidence near Gubbio, Italy. Alvarez and his father Luis W. Alvarez are most widely known for their discovery (with Frank Asaro and Helen Michel) that a clay layer occurring right at the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene (K-Pg) boundary was highly enriched in the element iridium. Since iridium enrichment is common in asteroids, but very uncommon on the Earth, they further postulated that the layer had been created by the impact of a large asteroid with the Earth and that this impact event was the likely cause of the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event.People and Discoveries: Alvarez finds evidence of dinosaur-killing asteroid, 1980, PBS website, accessed April 17, 2011 This iridium enrichment has now been observed in many other sites around the world. And further, the very large Chicxulub crater was identified and is now regarded as the definitive evidence of a large impact. Consequently, a majority of scientists now accept the impact scenario as the most likely cause for the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event which occurred 66 million years ago and eliminated 75% of all species, including all non-avian dinosaurs. His book, T. Rex and the Crater of Doom, details the discovery of the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event. In addition to his interest in extinction events and impacts, Alvarez has contributed to the understanding of Mediterranean tectonics, Roman geology and archeology, and the establishment of magnetostratigraphic correlations. Big History Alvarez helped to organize a meeting of Big Historians at the Geological Observatory at Coldigioco in Italy in 2010 which resulted in the establishment of the International Big History Association. Alvarez began teaching a course in Big History at UC Berkeley in 2006 under the title \\"Big History: Cosmos, Earth, Life, Humanity.\\"Letters and Science Discovery Courses He last taught the course in 2011 where it was videotaped and made freely available online.Big History online According to Alvarez, Big History is the \\"attempt to understand, in a unified and interdisciplinary way, the history of the Cosmos, Earth, Life and Humanity.\\" This definition was later adopted by the International Big History Association (IBHA).International Big History Association (IBHA) Alvarez's course is open to all majors and grade levels and seeks to provide a broad understanding of the past, present and future. Alvarez helped organize a meeting of Big Historians at the Geological Observatory at Coldigioco in Italy in 2010Origins of the International Big History Association which resulted in the establishment of the International Big History Association. In 2011, the IBHA is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization.International Big History Association Articles of Incorporation Alvarez was one of the founding members of the IBHA,Contacts for the International Big History Association and served on the advisory board until August 7, 2014 when he stepped down at the 2014 IBHA conference held at Dominican University of California. ChronoZoom Alvarez presented \\"Earth History in the Broadest Possible Context\\" at Chevron Auditorium on the UC Berkeley campus where ChronoZoom was first publicly demonstrated in 2012. Alvarez's most recent contribution to the field of Big History has been the creation of a free, open source, zoomable timeline in partnership with Microsoft Research called ChronoZoom.Abstracts - Microsoft Research ChronoZoom is a computer-graphical approach to dealing with this problem of visualizing and understanding time scales, and presenting vast quantities of historical information in a useful way.ChronoZoom Project Information ChronoZoom was introduced at the 97th Annual Faculty Research Lecture at UC Berkeley. Awards and honors Alvarez is the recipient of numerous awards and honors. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1983, and elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1991. He was awarded the 2006 Nevada Medal, the 2008 Vetlesen Prize,Geologist Who Linked Cosmic Strike to Dinosaurs' Extinction Takes Top Prize; The Vetlesen, on Level with Nobel, Goes to Walter Alvarez, Columbia University Earth Institute, October 16, 2008 and the Penrose Medal from the Geological Society of America.

This is a category because the composition of two continuous maps is again continuous, and the identity function is continuous. The study of Top and of properties of topological spaces using the techniques of category theory is known as categorical topology. N.B. Some authors use the name Top for the categories with topological manifolds or with compactly generated spaces as objects and continuous maps as morphisms. As a concrete category Like many categories, the category Top is a concrete category, meaning its objects are sets with additional structure (i.e. topologies) and its morphisms are functions preserving this structure. There is a natural forgetful functor :U : Top -> Set to the category of sets which assigns to each topological space the underlying set and to each continuous map the underlying function. The forgetful functor U has both a left adjoint :D : Set -> Top which equips a given set with the discrete topology, and a right adjoint :I : Set -> Top which equips a given set with the indiscrete topology. Both of these functors are, in fact, right inverses to U (meaning that UD and UI are equal to the identity functor on Set). Moreover, since any function between discrete or between indiscrete spaces is continuous, both of these functors give full embeddings of Set into Top. Top is also fiber-complete meaning that the category of all topologies on a given set X (called the fiber of U above X) forms a complete lattice when ordered by inclusion. The greatest element in this fiber is the discrete topology on X, while the least element is the indiscrete topology. Top is the model of what is called a topological category. These categories are characterized by the fact that every structured source (X \\\\to UA_i)_I has a unique initial lift ( A \\\\to A_i)_I. In Top the initial lift is obtained by placing the initial topology on the source. Topological categories have many properties in common with Top (such as fiber- completeness, discrete and indiscrete functors, and unique lifting of limits). Limits and colimits The category Top is both complete and cocomplete, which means that all small limits and colimits exist in Top. In fact, the forgetful functor U : Top ‚Üí Set uniquely lifts both limits and colimits and preserves them as well. Therefore, (co)limits in Top are given by placing topologies on the corresponding (co)limits in Set. Specifically, if F is a diagram in Top and (L, œÜ : L ‚Üí F) is a limit of UF in Set, the corresponding limit of F in Top is obtained by placing the initial topology on (L, œÜ : L ‚Üí F). Dually, colimits in Top are obtained by placing the final topology on the corresponding colimits in Set. Unlike many algebraic categories, the forgetful functor U : Top ‚Üí Set does not create or reflect limits since there will typically be non-universal cones in Top covering universal cones in Set. Examples of limits and colimits in Top include: *The empty set (considered as a topological space) is the initial object of Top; any singleton topological space is a terminal object. There are thus no zero objects in Top. *The product in Top is given by the product topology on the Cartesian product. The coproduct is given by the disjoint union of topological spaces. *The equalizer of a pair of morphisms is given by placing the subspace topology on the set- theoretic equalizer. Dually, the coequalizer is given by placing the quotient topology on the set-theoretic coequalizer. *Direct limits and inverse limits are the set-theoretic limits with the final topology and initial topology respectively. *Adjunction spaces are an example of pushouts in Top. Other properties *The monomorphisms in Top are the injective continuous maps, the epimorphisms are the surjective continuous maps, and the isomorphisms are the homeomorphisms. *The extremal monomorphisms are (up to isomorphism) the subspace embeddings. In fact, in Top all extremal monomorphisms happen to satisfy the stronger property of being regular. *The extremal epimorphisms are (essentially) the quotient maps. Every extremal epimorphism is regular. *The split monomorphisms are (essentially) the inclusions of retracts into their ambient space. *The split epimorphisms are (up to isomorphism) the continuous surjective maps of a space onto one of its retracts. *There are no zero morphisms in Top, and in particular the category is not preadditive. *Top is not cartesian closed (and therefore also not a topos) since it does not have exponential objects for all spaces. When this feature is desired, one often restricts to the full subcategory of compactly generated Hausdorff spaces CGHaus. Relationships to other categories *The category of pointed topological spaces Top‚Ä¢ is a coslice category over Top. * The homotopy category hTop has topological spaces for objects and homotopy equivalence classes of continuous maps for morphisms. This is a quotient category of Top. One can likewise form the pointed homotopy category hTop‚Ä¢. *Top contains the important category Haus of Hausdorff spaces as a full subcategory. The added structure of this subcategory allows for more epimorphisms: in fact, the epimorphisms in this subcategory are precisely those morphisms with dense images in their codomains, so that epimorphisms need not be surjective. *Top contains the full subcategory CGHaus of compactly generated Hausdorff spaces, which has the important property of being a Cartesian closed category while still containing all of the typical spaces of interest. This makes CGHaus a particularly convenient category of topological spaces that is often used in place of Top. * The forgetful functor to Set has both a left and a right adjoint, as described above in the concrete category section. * There is a functor to the category of locales Loc sending a topological space to its locale of open sets. This functor has a right adjoint that sends each locale to its topological space of points. This adjunction restricts to an equivalence between the category of sober spaces and spatial locales.

In the United States, trolley parks, which started in the 19th century, were picnic and recreation areas along or at the ends of streetcar lines in most of the larger cities. These were precursors to amusement parks. Trolley parks were often created by the streetcar companies to give people a reason to use their services on weekends. The parks originally consisted of picnic groves and pavilions, and often held events such as dances, concerts and fireworks. Many eventually added features such as swimming pools, carousels, Ferris wheels, roller coasters, sports fields, boats rides, restaurants and other resort facilities to become amusement parks. Various sources report the existence of between 1,500 and 2,000 amusement parks in the United States by 1919. Coney Island One such location was Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, where a horse-drawn street car line brought pleasure seekers to the beach beginning in 1829. In 1875, a million passengers rode the Coney Island Railroad, and in 1876 two million reached Coney Island. Hotels and amusements were built to accommodate both the upper-classes and the working-class. The first carousel was installed in the 1870s, the first Switchback Railway in 1881. It wasn't till 1895 that the first permanent amusement park in North America opened: Sea Lion Park at Coney Island. This park was one of the first to charge admission for entrance to the park in addition to selling tickets for rides within the park. In 1897, it was joined by Steeplechase Park, the first of three major amusement parks that would open in the area. George Tilyou designed the park to provide thrills and sweep away the restraints of the Victorian crowds. The combination of the nearby population center of New York City and the ease of access to the area made Coney Island the embodiment of the American amusement park. In addition there was Luna Park (opened in 1903) and Dreamland (opened in 1904). Coney Island was a huge success, and by 1910 attendance on a Sunday could reach a million people. Trolley parks decline The Jack Rabbit Derby Racer at Ramona Park, a trolley park in East Grand Rapids, MI. The park closed in 1955. By the early 20th century, there were hundreds of amusement parks, many of them starting as trolley parks, in operation around the USA. Every major city boasted one or more parks, often based on (or named) Coney Island, Luna Park, or Dreamland. This began the era of the ‚Äúgolden age‚Äù of amusement parks that reigned until the late 1920s. This was an era when the number of hours worked was reduced, while the amount of disposable income rose. The amusement parks reflected the mechanization and efficiency of industrialization, while serving as a source of fantasy and escape from real life. With the increasing number of automobiles in use, urban trolley parks gradually declined, due to lack of parking and changing demographics in the urban areas. Although the automobile provided people with more options for satisfying their entertainment needs, amusement parks that were accessible by car continued to be successful and new parks were developed. It was urban trolley parks that saw declining attendance. By the end of the 1920s, amusement parks were to suffer steep declines for various reasons, particularly the Great Depression.

It was formerly known under the scientific name Atteva punctella (see Taxonomy section). This small, very colorful moth resembles a true bug or beetle when not in flight, but in flight it resembles a wasp. Host plants The ailanthus webworm is thought to be native to South Florida and the American tropics (south to Costa Rica), which were the habitat of its original larval host plants: the paradise tree (Simarouba glauca) and Simarouba amara. Another tree called tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima), originally from China, has been widely introduced and naturalized, and Atteva aurea has been able to adapt to this new host plant, giving rise to its common name, the \\"ailanthus webworm\\". Ailanthus, common name \\"tree of heaven\\", is considered an invasive species, although it is still sold by nurseries as a yard plant, mainly because it is one of the species that will grow in polluted or otherwise difficult places. Atteva aurea can be a minor pest in nurseries, although it rarely does serious damage. Ailanthus webworm in Ailanthus altissima tree Climate This tropical moth is commonly seen in summer throughout the continental US, and occasionally eastern Canada (its northern limit is eastern Ontario and south-western Quebec beyond the host range). This species appears to be either adapting to colder areas, or staying further north due to changing climates. Life cycle Larvae produce nests on the host plant by pulling two or more leaflets around a network of loose webbing. Then they consume the leaflets and bark. The caterpillars have a wide, light greenish-brown stripe down their backs and several thin, alternating white and olive-green stripes along their sides. The range of colors is from light brown to dark black. The adult moth visits flowers, is diurnal, and is a pollinator. The life cycle from egg to egg can happen in four weeks. Due to this being a species from warmer areas, it lacks a diapause stage. Larvae can be found from mid-spring to a hard freeze. There may be many generations each summer with eggs being laid on the webs of other larvae. This can result in a communal web that has multiple generations - from eggs to various larva stages to pupae. Mating happens in the mornings with egg-laying apparently happening in the evening. Eggs are found individually, not in clusters, even though each web may contain many separate eggs. Taxonomy Image:Atteva edithella.JPGAtteva edithella, now considered a synonym of Atteva aurea Image:Atteva exquisita.JPGAtteva exquisita, now considered a synonym of Atteva aurea Image:Atteva ergatica.JPGAtteva ergatica, now considered a synonym of Atteva aurea Image:Atteva microsticta.JPGAtteva microsticta, now considered a synonym of Atteva aurea Wilson et al. (2010) discovered that morphologically similar Attevid moths were assigned two different names, Atteva ergatica in Costa Rica and Atteva punctella in North America, but had identical DNA barcodes. Combining DNA barcoding, morphology and food plant records also revealed a complex of two sympatric species that are diagnosable by their DNA barcodes and their facies in Costa Rica. However, neither of the names could be correctly applied to either species, as A. ergatica is a junior synonym and A. punctella a junior homonym. By linking the specimens to type material through morphology and DNA barcoding, they determined that the species distributed from Costa Rica to southern Quebec and Ontario, should be called A. aurea, whereas the similar and marginally sympatric species found in Central America should be called A. pustulella. The name Phalaena (Tinea) punctella was recognized as a junior homonym almost immediately after its description but has been retained through several major works. The two objective replacement names proposed were Tinea punctella (Fabricius, 1787) and Crameria subtilis (H√ºbner, 1822). The oldest valid name to replace Phalaena punctella is Tinea pustulella but this remained overlooked until recently. Over time seven more nominal taxa were synonymized under Atteva pustulella, being Deiopeia aurea (Fitch, 1857), Poeciloptera compta Clemens, 1861, Oeta compta floridana (Neumoegen, 1891), A. edithella (Busck, 1908), A. exquisita (Busck, 1912), A. ergatica (Walsingham, 1914) and A. microsticta (Walsingham, 1914). There were early suspicions that A. aurea and A. pustulella might represent different species, the former distributed in the United States, the latter in South America, but at the time there was insufficient material to support this view (Walsingham 1897). A recent taxonomic review of New World Atteva introduced several nomenclatural changes and recognized three separate species within the long-standing concept of A. pustulella: A. pustulella, A. aurea and A. floridana. The most recent treatment retains A. floridana as a synonym of Atteva aurea.

The common name is derived from the head shape. Melon-headed whales are widely distributed throughout deep tropical/subtropical waters worldwide, however they are rarely encountered at sea. They are found near shore only around oceanic islands, such as Hawai ªi, French Polynesia and the Philippines. Taxonomy The melon-headed whale is the only member of the genus Peponocephala. First recorded from a specimen collected in Hawai ªi in 1841, the species was originally described as a member of the dolphin family and named Lagenorhynchus electra by John Edward Gray in 1846. The melon-headed whale was later determined to be sufficiently distinct from other Lagenorhynchus species to be accorded its own genus. A member of the subfamily Globicephalinae, melon-headed whales are closely related to long-finned and short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas and G. macrorhynchus, respectively) and the pygmy killer whale (Feresa attenuata). Collectively, these species (including killer whales Orcinus orca, and false killer whales Pseudorca crassidens) are known by the common name ‚Äòblackfish‚Äô. Melon-headed whales are one of the smallest species of cetacean (after pygmy killer whales) to have the word ‚Äòwhale‚Äô in their common name. Description Melon-headed whales have a robust, dolphin-like body, a tapering, conical head (head shape triangular when viewed from above) with no discernible beak and a relatively tall, falcate (sickle-shaped) dorsal fin located near the middle of the back. Body coloration is charcoal-gray to dark-gray body. A dark face ‚Äòmask‚Äô extends from around the eye to the front of the melon and larger animals have whitish lips. Melon-headed whales have a dark colored dorsal cape that starts narrowly at the front of the head and dips down at a steep angle below the dorsal fin. The boundary between the darker cape and coloration on the flanks is often faint or diffuse. Both the mask and dorsal cape are often only visible in good lighting conditions. Compared to females, adult males have more rounded heads, longer flippers, taller dorsal fins, broader tail flukes and some have a pronounced ventral keel posterior to the anus. Melon-headed whales grow up to in length, and weigh up to , adult males being slightly larger than females. Length at birth is approximately . Melon-headed whales are physically mature at 13‚Äì15 years and live up to 45 years. Similar species At-sea, melon- headed whales can be confused with pygmy killer whales, which are very similar in appearance and share almost identical habitat and range. The shape of the head, flippers and dorsal cape can be useful diagnostic features. Melon-headed whales have flippers with sharply pointed tips whereas pygmy killer whales have rounded flipper tips, and viewed from above, the head shape is more triangular than the rounded head of the pygmy killer whale. The dorsal cape of melon-headed whales is rounded and dips much lower below the dorsal fin than that of pygmy killer whales, which dips at a relatively shallow angle and is more sharply demarcated in color between the dark cape and lighter flanks. While both species have white around the mouth, in adult pygmy killer whales this can extend onto the face. Many of these traits are difficult to distinguish in challenging sea and/or lighting conditions, and behavior is often a useful aid to identification. Pygmy killer whales are slower moving (although melon-headed whales often log motionless at the surface), and are usually found in much smaller groups than melon-headed whales. Large groups (more than 100) are more likely to be melon-headed whales. From a distance melon-headed whales could also be confused with false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens), but the much larger size‚Äì adult length‚Äìlong slender body shape and relatively smaller dorsal fin of false killer whales should distinguish them from melon-headed whales. Stranded/post-mortem individuals can be easily identified by tooth number: melon-headed whales have 20 ‚Äì 25 pairs of slender teeth (more similar to the teeth of smaller dolphins than other blackfish) in both the upper and lower jaws compared to 8‚Äì13 pairs of robust teeth in both the upper and lower jaws for pygmy killer whales. Geographic range and distribution A pod in Bohol Sea between Balicasag Island and Alona Beach Melon-headed whales occur in deep tropical/subtropical oceanic waters, between 40¬∞N and 35¬∞S. Although considered an offshore pelagic species, in some regions there are island-associated populations (e.g., Hawai ªi) and they can be found close to shore associated with oceanic islands and archipelagoes, such as Palmyra and the Philippines. Sightings or strandings at the extremes of their range are likely associated with extensions of warm currents. Melon- headed whales are not known to be migratory. Behavior=Foraging Melon-headed whales feed primarily on pelagic and mesopelagic squid and small fish. Crustaceans (shrimp) have also been reported from stomach contents. Mesopelagic squid and fish species exhibit diel vertical migration behavior, inhabiting greater depths during the day and moving hundreds of meters to shallower depths after dusk to feed on plankton. Melon-headed whales feed at night, when their prey is within the upper of the water column. In the Hawaiian Islands, individuals fitted with depth-transmitting satellite tags made night-time foraging dives that had an average range of , with a maximum dive depth of recorded. Social Melon-headed whales are a highly social species and usually travel in large groups of 100 ‚Äì 500 individuals, with occasional sightings of herds as large as 1000‚Äì2000. Large herds appear to consist of smaller subgroups that aggregate into larger groups. Data from mass strandings in Japan suggest melon-headed whales may have a matrilineal social structure (i.e., related through female kin/groups organized around an older female and their relatives); the biased sex ratio (higher number of females) of the stranding groups suggesting mature males may move between groups. While melon-headed whales associate in large groups (a common trait amongst the oceanic dolphins, in contrast to the smaller group sizes of other blackfish species) their social structure may be more stable and intermediate between the larger blackfish (pilot whales, killer whales and false killer whales) and smaller oceanic dolphins. However, genetic studies of melon-headed whales across the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Ocean basins suggest that there is relatively high level of connectivity (inter-breeding) between populations. This indicates that melon-headed whales may not show strong fidelity to their natal group (the group into which the individual was born) and that there are higher rates of movement of individuals between populations than in other blackfish species. Larger group sizes may increase competition for prey resources, requiring large home ranges and broad-scale foraging movements. Observations of daily activity patterns of melon-headed whales near oceanic islands suggest they spend the mornings resting or logging in near-surface waters after foraging at night. Surface activity (such as tail slapping and spyhopping) and vocalizations associated with socializing (communication whistles, rather than echolocation clicks used for foraging) increase during the afternoons. The daily pattern of behavior observed in island-associated populations, combined with the larger group sizes of melon-headed whales (compared to that typically seen in other blackfish species) is more similar to the fission-fusion social structure of spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris). These behavioral traits may relate to predation avoidance (bigger groups offer some protection from large oceanic sharks) and foraging habits (both species are nocturnal predators that prey on predictable, relatively abundant mesopelagic squid and fish that make diel vertical migrations from the deep-sea to the surface). Melon-headed whales frequently associate with Fraser's dolphins (Lagenodelphis hosei), and are also sighted, although less commonly, in mixed herds with other dolphin species such as spinner dolphins, common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), rough- toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis), short-finned pilot whales and pantropical spotted dolphins (Stenella attenuata). A unique case of inter- species adoption between (presumably) an orphaned melon-headed whale calf and a common bottlenose dolphin mother was recorded in French Polynesia. The calf was first observed in 2014 at less than one month of age, swimming with the bottlenose dolphin female and her own biological offspring. The melon-headed whale calf was observed suckling from the bottlenose dolphin female, and was repeatedly sighted with its adoptive/foster mother until 2018. In August 2017 off the island of Kaua ªi, Hawai ªi, a hybrid between a melon-headed whale and rough-toothed dolphin was observed travelling with a melon-headed whale amongst a group of rough-toothed dolphins. The hybrid superficially resembled a melon-headed whale, but closer observation revealed it had features of both species and some features intermediate between the two species, particularly in head shape. Genetic testing of a skin biopsy sample confirmed that the individual was a hybrid between a female melon-headed whale and a rough- toothed dolphin male. Predators Melon-headed whales may be predated upon by large sharks and killer whales. Scars and wounds from non-lethal bites of cookie cutter sharks (Isitius brasiliensis) have been observed on free-ranging and stranded animals. Breeding Little is known about the reproductive behavior of melon-headed whales. The most information comes from analyses of large stranding groups in Japanese waters, where sexual maturity for females is reached at 7 years of age. Females give birth to a single calf every 3 ‚Äì 4 years after a gestation of approximately 12 months. Off Japan, the calving season appears to be long (from April to October) without an obvious peak. In Hawaiian waters newborn melon-headed whales have been observed in all months except December, suggesting births occur year round, but sightings of newborns peak between March to June. Newborn melon-headed whales have been observed in April and June in the Philippines. In the Southern Hemisphere calving also appears to occur over an extended period, from August to December. Strandings Melon-headed whales are known to mass strand, often in groups numbering in the hundreds, indicative of the strong social bonds within herds of this species. Mass strandings of melon-headed whales have been reported in Hawai ªi, eastern Japan, the Philippines, northern Australia, Madagascar, Brazil and the Cape Verde Islands. Two of these mass stranding events have been linked to anthropogenic sonar, associated with naval activities in Hawai ªi and high frequency multi-beam sonar used for oil and gas exploration in Madagascar. The mass stranding at Hanalei Bay, Kaua ªi, Hawai ªi is more precisely described as a ‚Äònear‚Äô mass stranding event, as the group of >150 melon-headed whales was prevented from stranding by human intervention. The animals occupied the shallow waters of a confined bay for over 28 hours before being herded back into deeper waters by stranding response staff and volunteers, community members, state and federal authorities. Only a single calf is known to have died on this occasion. The frequency of mass strandings of melon-headed whales appears to have increased over the past 30+ years. Movement Melon-headed whales are fast swimmers; they travel in large, tightly packed groups and can create a lot of spray when surfacing, often porpoising (repeatedly leaping clear of the water surface at a shallow angle) when travelling at speed, and are known to spyhop and also may jump clear out of the water. Melon-headed whales can be wary of boats, but in some regions will approach boats and bow-ride. Population status The world population is unknown, but abundance estimates for large regions are approximately 45,000 in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, 2,235 in northern Gulf of Mexico and in the Philippines 920 in the eastern Sulu Sea and 1,380 in Ta√±on Strait between Cebu and Negros Islands. There are two known populations in Hawai ªi: a population of approximately 450 individuals resident to shallower waters of the northwest side of Hawai ªi Island (the ‚ÄòKohola resident population‚Äô) and a much larger population of approximately 8,000 individuals that moves among the main Hawaiian Islands in deeper waters. Because the Hawai ªi Island resident population has a restricted range (sightings have only been recorded off the northwest side of Hawai ªi Island), and at times most of, or the entire resident population can be together in a single group, there is some concern that this population may be at risk from fisheries interactions, and exposure to anthropogenic noise, particularly in light of U.S. Navy activities in the region, given the potential link between sonar and mass stranding events. Interactions with humans=Fisheries bycatch Small cetaceans such as melon-headed whales are vulnerable to fisheries bycatch and may be injured or killed through interactions with fisheries or entanglement in lost or discarded netting. Small numbers of melon-headed whales have been caught incidentally in the longline fishery targeting tuna and swordfish off Mayotte, and in driftnet fisheries in the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Ghana and India. In the eastern tropical Pacific purse-seine tuna fisheries, melon-headed whales have been rarely taken as bycatch. and have not been recorded in the southwest Indian Ocean purse-seine fishery Individual melon-headed whales exhibit injuries such as body scars and dorsal fin disfigurements likely due to interactions with fisheries in Hawai ªi and near Mayotte in the Mozambique Channel Islands. The small numbers of injured individuals observed near Mayotte suggests that either interactions with the pelagic longline fishery in this region are rare for this species, or that individuals are more often killed rather than injured. Mortalities are also likely in other countries where gill- or driftnet fisheries occur, however data on bycatch in many regions are sparse. Animals caught as bycatch are sometimes used as bait in fisheries. Hunting Individuals are taken for bait or human consumption in small cetacean subsistence and harpoon fisheries in several regions, including Sri Lanka, the Caribbean, the Philippines and Indonesia. At Dixcove port in Ghana, melon-headed whales are the third highest cetacean species caught for ‚Äòmarine bushmeat‚Äô by artisanal fishermen, through both bycatch from drift gillnets and occasional directed catch. The Japanese drive fishery has taken herds of melon-headed whales occasionally in the past. In 2017/18 Japan increased the annual proposed catch quota to 704 individuals for the drive fishery at Taiji. Pollution Environmental contaminants stemming from plastic debris, oil spills and dumping of industrial wastes at-sea, in addition to agricultural run-off from terrestrial sources, can lead to bioaccumulation in marine ecosystems and pose a threat to melon-headed whales (as with all marine mammals and long-lived, high trophic level consumers). Persistent organic pollutants (POPs)‚Äìinclude environmental contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides e.g. dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) and hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and organobromine compounds such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)‚Äìare lipophilic (fat-soluble) and can accumulate in the blubber of marine mammals. In high concentrations these pollutants can interfere with overall health, hormone levels and impact both the immune and reproductive systems. Females with high contaminant levels can pass contaminant loads across the placenta or via lactation from mother to calf, leading to calf mortality. Blubber samples from melon-headed whales stranded in Japan and Hawai ªi were found to have PCB concentrations above thresholds considered toxic. Off Japan the levels of PBDE and chlordane related compounds (CHL) in blubber increased during 1980‚Äì2000. Noise Melon-headed whales may be vulnerable to impacts from anthropogenic (human generated) noise, such as those associated with military sonar activities, seismic surveys and high power multi-beam echosounder operations. Based on previous stranding events linking mass strandings with sonar, melon-headed whales appear to be one of the more sensitive species to mid-frequency active sonar (1 to 10 kHz) used in military operations and other types of sonar. For island-associated populations, such as those in the Hawaiian archipelago, Palmyra Atoll and the Marquesas Islands, exposure to anthropogenic noise could result in displacement from important habitat. Whale watching Regions in which melon-headed whales can be reliably sighted are few, however Hawai‚Äôi, the Maldives, the Philippines, and in the eastern Caribbean, especially around Dominica, are the best places to see them. The International Whaling Commission (IWC) has guidelines for whale watching to ensure minimum disturbance to wildlife, but not every operator adheres to them. Conservation status The melon-headed whale is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. There is little information available on current levels of bycatch and commercial hunting, therefore the potential effects on melon-headed whale populations are undetermined. The current population trend is unknown. The species is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). In Australia, there are stricter domestic measures for trade in cetaceans, and all species are treated as though they are listed on Appendix I. The melon-headed whale is included in the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia (Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU) and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MoU). As with all other marine mammal species, the melon-headed whale is protected in United States waters under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA).

It was published in 1956 in Psychological Review by the cognitive psychologist George A. Miller of Harvard University's Department of Psychology. It is often interpreted to argue that the number of objects an average human can hold in short-term memory is 7 ¬± 2. This has occasionally been referred to as Miller's law.  Miller's article  In his article, Miller discussed a coincidence between the limits of one-dimensional absolute judgment and the limits of short-term memory. In a one-dimensional absolute-judgment task, a person is presented with a number of stimuli that vary on one dimension (e.g., 10 different tones varying only in pitch) and responds to each stimulus with a corresponding response (learned before). Performance is nearly perfect up to five or six different stimuli but declines as the number of different stimuli is increased. The task can be described as one of information transmission: The input consists of one out of n possible stimuli, and the output consists of one out of n responses. The information contained in the input can be determined by the number of binary decisions that need to be made to arrive at the selected stimulus, and the same holds for the response. Therefore, people's maximum performance on one-dimensional absolute judgement can be characterized as an information channel capacity with approximately 2 to 3 bits of information, which corresponds to the ability to distinguish between four and eight alternatives. The second cognitive limitation Miller discusses is memory span. Memory span refers to the longest list of items (e.g., digits, letters, words) that a person can repeat back in correct order on 50% of trials immediately after presentation. Miller observed that memory span of young adults is approximately seven items. He noticed that memory span is approximately the same for stimuli with vastly different amount of information‚Äîfor instance, binary digits have 1 bit each; decimal digits have 3.32 bits each; words have about 10 bits each. Miller concluded that memory span is not limited in terms of bits but rather in terms of chunks. A chunk is the largest meaningful unit in the presented material that the person recognizes‚Äîthus, what counts as a chunk depends on the knowledge of the person being tested. For instance, a word is a single chunk for a speaker of the language but is many chunks for someone who is totally unfamiliar with the language and sees the word as a collection of phonetic segments. Miller recognized that the correspondence between the limits of one-dimensional absolute judgment and of short-term memory span was only a coincidence, because only the first limit, not the second, can be characterized in information-theoretic terms (i.e., as a roughly constant number of bits). Therefore, there is nothing \\"magical\\" about the number seven, and Miller used the expression only rhetorically. Nevertheless, the idea of a \\"magical number 7\\" inspired much theorizing, rigorous and less rigorous, about the capacity limits of human cognition. The number seven constitutes a useful heuristic, reminding us that lists that are much longer than that become significantly harder to remember and process simultaneously.  The \\"magical number 7\\" and working memory capacity  Later research on short-term memory and working memory revealed that memory span is not a constant even when measured in a number of chunks. The number of chunks a human can recall immediately after presentation depends on the category of chunks used (e.g., span is around seven for digits, around six for letters, and around five for words), and even on features of the chunks within a category. Chunking is used by the brain's short-term memory as a method for keeping groups of information accessible for easy recall. It functions and works best as labels that one is already familiar with‚Äîthe incorporation of new information into a label that is already well rehearsed into one's long-term memory. These chunks must store the information in such a way that they can be disassembled into the necessary data. The storage capacity is dependent on the information being stored. For instance, span is lower for long words than it is for short words. In general, memory span for verbal contents (digits, letters, words, etc.) strongly depends on the time it takes to speak the contents aloud. Some researchers have therefore proposed that the limited capacity of short-term memory for verbal material is not a \\"magic number\\" but rather a \\"magic spell\\". Baddeley used this finding to postulate that one component of his model of working memory, the phonological loop, is capable of holding around 2 seconds of sound. However, the limit of short-term memory cannot easily be characterized as a constant \\"magic spell\\" either, because memory span also depends on other factors besides speaking duration. For instance, span depends on the lexical status of the contents (i.e., whether the contents are words known to the person or not). Several other factors also affect a person's measured span, and therefore it is difficult to pin down the capacity of short-term or working memory to a number of chunks. Nonetheless, Cowan has proposed that working memory has a capacity of about four chunks in young adults (and less in children and older adults). Tarnow finds that in a classic experiment typically argued as supporting a 4 item buffer by Murdock, there is in fact no evidence for such and thus the \\"magical number\\", at least in the Murdock experiment, is 1. Other prominent theories of short-term memory capacity argue against measuring capacity in terms of a fixed number of elements.  Other cognitive numeric limits  Cowan also noted a number of other limits of cognition that point to a \\"magical number four\\", and different from Miller, he argued that this correspondence is no coincidence. One other process that seems to be limited at about four elements is subitizing, the rapid enumeration of small numbers of objects. When a number of objects are flashed briefly, their number can be determined very quickly, at a glance, when the number does not exceed the subitizing limit, which is about four objects. Larger numbers of objects must be counted, which is a slower process. The film Rain Man portrayed an autistic savant, who was able to rapidly determine the number of toothpicks from an entire box spilled on the floor, apparently subitizing a much larger number than four objects. A similar feat was informally observed by neuropsychologist Oliver Sacks and reported in his book The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat. Therefore, one might suppose that this limit is an arbitrary limit imposed by our cognition rather than necessarily being a physical limit. (On the other hand, autism expert Daniel Tammet has suggested that the children Sacks observed may have pre-counted the matches in the box.) There is also evidence that even four chunks is a high estimate: Gobet and Clarkson conducted an experiment and found that over half of the memory recall conditions yielded only about two chunks. Research also shows that the size, rather than the number, of chunks that are stored in short-term memory is what allows for enhanced memory in individuals.

Until 1999, all members of the Peerage of England held the right to sit in the House of Lords; they did not elect a limited group of representatives. All peers who were created after 1707 as Peers of Great Britain and after 1801 as Peers of the United Kingdom held the same right to sit in the House of Lords. Representative peers were introduced in 1707, when the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland were united into the Kingdom of Great Britain. At the time there were 168 English and 154 Scottish peers. The English peers feared that the House of Lords would be swamped by the Scottish element, and consequently the election of a small number of representative peers to represent Scotland was negotiated. A similar arrangement was adopted when the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland merged into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in January 1801. Scotland was allowed to elect sixteen representative peers, while Ireland could elect twenty-eight. Those chosen by Scotland sat for the life of one Parliament, and following each dissolution new Scottish peers were elected. In contrast, Irish representative peers sat for life. Elections for Irish peers ceased when the Irish Free State came into existence as a Dominion in December 1922. However, already-elected Irish peers continued to be entitled to sit until their death. Elections for Scottish peers ended in 1963, when all Scottish peers obtained the right to sit in the House of Lords. Under the House of Lords Act 1999, a new form of representative peer was introduced to allow some hereditary peers to stay in the House of Lords. Scotland The Act of Union 1707 was ratified in Scotland on 16 January 1707, and by the English Parliament on 19 March 1707 Under articles XXII and XXIII of the Act of Union 1707, Scottish peers were entitled to elect sixteen representative peers to the House of Lords. Each served for one Parliament or a maximum of seven years, but could be re-elected during future Parliaments. Upon the summons of a new Parliament, the Sovereign would issue a proclamation summoning Scottish peers to the Palace of Holyroodhouse. The elections were held in the Great Gallery, a large room decorated by eighty-nine of Jacob de Wet's portraits of Scottish monarchs, from Fergus M√≥r to Charles II. The Lord Clerk Register would read out the Peerage Roll as indicates his presence when called. The Roll was then re‚Äìread, with each peer responding by publicly announcing his votes and the return being sent to the clerk of the crown at London. The same procedure was used whenever a vacancy arose. The block voting system was used, with each peer casting as many votes as there were seats to be filled. The system, however, permitted the party with the greatest number of peers, normally the Conservatives, to procure a disproportionate number of seats, with opposing parties sometimes being left entirely unrepresented. The Lord Clerk Register was responsible for tallying the votes. The return issued by the Lord Clerk Register was sufficient evidence to admit the representative peers to Parliament; however, unlike other peers, Scottish representatives did not receive writs of summons. The position and rights of Scottish peers in relation to the House of Lords remained unclear during most of the eighteenth century. In 1711, The 4th Duke of Hamilton, a peer of Scotland, was made Duke of Brandon in the Peerage of Great Britain. When he sought to sit in the House of Lords, he was denied admittance, the Lords ruling that a peer of Scotland could not sit in the House of Lords unless he was a representative peer, even if he also held a British peerage dignity. They reasoned that the Act of Union 1707 had established the number of Scots peers in the House of Lords at no more and no less than sixteen. In 1782, however, the House of Lords reversed the decision, holding that the Crown could admit anyone it pleases to the House of Lords, whether a Scottish peer or not, subject only to qualifications such as being of full age. Under the Peerage Act 1963, all Scottish peers procured the right to sit in the House of Lords, and the system of electing representative peers was abolished. Scottish as well as British and English hereditary peers lost their automatic right to sit in the Upper House with the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999. During the debate on the House of Lords Bill, a question arose as to whether the proposal would violate the Treaty of Union. In suggesting that the Bill did indeed violate the Articles of Union, it was submitted that, prior to Union, the Estates of Parliament, Scotland's old, pre-Union parliament, was entitled to impose conditions, and that one fundamental condition was a guarantee of representation of Scotland in both Houses of Parliament at Westminster. It was implied, furthermore, that the Peerage Act 1963 did not violate the requirement of Scottish representation, set out in the Article XXII of the Treaty of Union, by allowing all Scottish peers to sit in the House of Lords: as long as a minimum of sixteen seats were reserved for Scotland, the principles of the Article would be upheld. It was further argued that the only way to rescind the requirement of Article XXII would be to dissolve the Union between England and Scotland, which the House of Lords Bill did not seek to do. Scottish representative peers were chosen in the Palace of Holyroodhouse Counsel for the Government held a different view. It was noted that the Peerage Act 1963 explicitly repealed the portions of the Articles of Union relating to elections of representative peers, and that no parliamentary commentators had raised doubts as to the validity of those repeals. As Article XXII had been, or at least purportedly, repealed, there was nothing specific in the Treaty that the bill transgressed. It was further asserted by the Government that Article XXII could be repealed because it had not been entrenched. Examples of entrenched provisions are numerous: England and Scotland were united \\"forever\\", the Court of Session was to remain \\"in all time coming within Scotland as it is now constituted\\", and the establishment of the Church of Scotland was \\"effectually and unalterably secured\\". Article XXII, however, did not include any words of entrenchment, making it \\"fundamental or unalterable in all time coming\\". Further, the Government pointed out that, even if the election of Scottish peers were entrenched, Parliament could amend the provision under the doctrine of Parliamentary sovereignty. Though the position of the Church of Scotland was \\"unalterably\\" secured, the Universities (Scotland) Act 1853 repealed the requirement that professors declare their faith before assuming a position. In Ireland, the Church of Ireland was entirely disestablished in 1869, though the Articles of Union with Ireland had clearly entrenched the establishment of that body. In December 1922, the Union with most of Ireland was dissolved upon the creation of the Irish Free State, though Great Britain and all of Ireland were supposedly united \\"forever.\\" It was therefore suggested that Parliament could, if it pleased, repeal an Article of Union as well amend as any underlying principle. The Privileges Committee unanimously found that the Articles of Union would not be breached by the House of Lords Bill if it were enacted. The bill did receive Royal Assent, and from 1999, hereditary peers have not had the automatic right to sit in Parliament. Ireland The Chamber of the Irish House of Lords in Parliament House on College Green in Dublin was the location of the first election of Irish representative peers. Irish representation in the Westminster parliament was outlined by articles IV and VIII of the agreement embodied in the Acts of Union 1800, which also required the Irish Parliament to pass an act before the union providing details for implementation.Malcomson 2000 p.312; Irish peers were allowed to elect twenty-eight representative peers as Lords Temporal, each of whom could serve for life. The Chamber of the Irish House of Lords, located in Parliament House on College Green in central Dublin, housed the first election, attended by the peers or their proxies. The government mistakenly circulated a list of the successful candidates before the vote. The Clerk of the Crown and Hanaper in Ireland was responsible for electoral arrangements; each peer voted by an open and public ballot. After the Union, new elections were held by postal vote within 52 days of a vacancy.Malcomson 2000 p.313 Vacancies arose through death or, in the case of Baron Ashtown in 1915, bankruptcy. No vacancy was created where a representative peer acquired a UK peerage, as when Lord Curzon was made Baron Scarsdale in 1911. The Lord Chancellor of Great Britain‚Äîthe presiding officer of the House of Lords‚Äîcertified the vacancy,Finnelly, (1830), p 164 while the Lord Chancellor of Ireland directed the Clerk of the Crown and Hanaper to issue ballots to Irish peers, receive the completed ballots, determine the victor, and announce the result, which was then published in both The Dublin Gazette and The London Gazette.May, A practical treatise ... of Parliament (1851), p 169; Roman Catholic peers could not vote or stand for election until the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829.Malcomson (2000) p. 311 The process of being recognised by the Westminster Committee of Privileges as an elector was more cumbersome and expensive than being recognised as a (British or Irish) peer, until the orders drawn up in 1800 were amended in 1857. Successive governments tried to prevent the election of absentee landlords. An exception was Lord Curzon, who won election as a representative peer in 1908, despite never having claimed the right to be an elector; he had been refused a peerage of the United Kingdom by the Liberal government of the day. The Acts of Union united the Church of England and Church of Ireland, whose bishops and archbishops had previously sat as Lords Spiritual in their respective Houses of Lords. In the united Parliament, there were at first four Irish prelates at any one time, one archbishop and three diocesan bishops, who sat for a session before ceding their seats to colleagues on a fixed rotation of dioceses.40 Geo. 4 c.39 [Ir.] sec.5Malcomson (2002), p. 325 The rotation passed over any bishop already serving as an elected representative peer, as when Charles Agar sat as Viscount Somerton rather than as Archbishop of Dublin. The rotation was changed by the Church Temporalities Act 1833, which merged many dioceses and degraded the archbishoprics of Tuam and Cashel to bishoprics. No Irish bishops sat in Westminster as Lords Spiritual after the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland in 1871, brought about by the Irish Church Act 1869, although Robin Eames, then Archbishop of Armagh was made a life peer in 1995. The Most Rev. the Earl of Normanton, Lord Archbishop of Dublin, one of the first 28 Irish representative peers Following the establishment of the Irish Free State in December 1922, Irish peers ceased to elect representatives, although those already elected continued to have the right to serve for life; the last of the temporal peers, Francis Needham, 4th Earl of Kilmorey, by chance a peer from an Ulster family, died in 1961. Disputes had arisen long before as to whether Irish representative peers could still be elected. The Act establishing the Irish Free State was silent on the matter, to some seeming to mean that the right had not been abolished, but the Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act 1922 had abolished the office of Lord Chancellor of Ireland, whose involvement was required in the election process; the office of Clerk of the Crown had also been abolished in Ireland. After 1922 various Irish peers petitioned the House of Lords for a restoration of their right to elect representatives. In 1962, the Joint Committee on House of Lords Reform again rejected such requests. In the next year, when the Peerage Act 1963 (which, among other things, gave all peers in the Peerage of Scotland the right to sit in the House of Lords) was being considered, an amendment similarly to allow Irish peers all to be summoned was defeated, by ninety votes to eight. Instead, the new Act confirmed the right of all Irish peers to stand for election to the House of Commons and to vote at parliamentary elections, which were rights they had always had. In 1965, the 8th Earl of Antrim,another peer from Ulster, and other Irish peers, petitioned the House of Lords, arguing that the right to elect representative peers had never been formally abolished. The House of Lords ruled against them. Lord Reid, a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, based his ruling on the Act of Union, which stated that representative peers sat \\"on the part of Ireland.\\" He reasoned that, since the island had been divided into the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland, there was no such political entity called \\"Ireland\\" which the representative peers could be said to represent. Lord Reid wrote, \\"A statutory provision is impliedly repealed if a later enactment brings to an end a state of things the continuance of which is essential for its operation.\\" In contrast, Lord Wilberforce, another Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, disagreed that a major enactment such as the Act of Union could be repealed by implication. He argued instead on the basis that the Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act 1922‚Äîwhich was silent on the election of representative peers‚Äîabolished the posts of Lord Chancellor of Ireland and Clerk of the Crown in Ireland. The Lord Chancellor of Ireland was responsible for calling elections of representative peers, and the Clerk of the Crown in Ireland was responsible for sending peers their ballots. Since these offices had been abolished; Lord Wilberforce argued against any mechanism by which Irish peers could be elected. Here too, the petitioners lost. The petitioners failed to raise the status of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom. Burke's Peerage & Baronetage suggests that if this fact had been foremost, Lord Wilberforce's arguments relating to the removal of the electoral mechanism for the election could be rebutted, as the Lord Chancellor of Ireland and the Clerk of the Crown in Ireland did have replacements in Northern Ireland. The reason for excluding the arguments relating to Northern Ireland from the petition \\"was that leading counsel for the petitioning Irish peers was convinced that the members of the Committee for Privileges were with him on what he considered was his best argument and did not want to alienate them by introducing another point.\\" To prevent further appeals on the matter, Parliament repealed, as a part of the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1971, the sections of the Acts of Union relating to the election of Irish representative peers. House of Commons After the Union of England and Scotland in 1707, Scottish peers, including those who did not sit as representative peers, were excluded from the House of Commons. Irish peers were not subject to the same restrictions. Irish members not nominated as representative peers were allowed to serve in Parliament as representatives of a constituencies in Great Britain, although not in Ireland, provided they gave up their privileges as a peer. Lord Curzon, for example, specifically requested an Irish peerage when made Viceroy of India, so that he would not be debarred from sitting in the House of Commons on his return.Malcomson 2000 p.320 The Peerage Act 1963 allowed all Scottish peers to sit in the House of Lords; it also permitted all Irish peers to sit in the House of Commons for any constituency in the United Kingdom, as well as to vote in parliamentary elections, without being deprived of the remaining privileges of peerage. Hereditary \\"representative peers\\" During the passage of the House of Lords Bill in 1999, controversy surrounding House of Lords reform remained, and the Bill was conceived as a first stage of Lords reform. The \\"Weatherill\\" amendment‚Äîso called since it was proposed by former House of Commons Speaker Bernard Weatherill‚Äîprovided for a number of hereditary peers to remain as members of the House of Lords, during the first stage of Lords reform. It could then be reviewed during the next stage of the reform, when the system of appointed life peerages came under examination. In exchange for the House not delaying the passage of the Bill into law, the Government agreed to this amendment, and it then became part of the House of Lords Act 1999, and 92 hereditary peers were allowed to remain. The ninety-two peers are made up of three separate groups. Fifteen 'office-holders' comprise Deputy Speakers and Deputy Chairmen, and are elected by the House, while seventy-five party and Crossbench members are elected by their own party or group. In addition, there are two royal appointments: the Lord Great Chamberlain, currently the Marquess of Cholmondeley, is appointed as the Queen's representative in Parliament, while the post of Earl Marshal remains purely hereditary; the office has been held since 1672 by the Dukes of Norfolk and is responsible for ceremonies such as the State Opening of Parliament.

They include retail nurseries which sell to the general public, wholesale nurseries which sell only to businesses such as other nurseries and to commercial gardeners, and private nurseries which supply the needs of institutions or private estates. Nurseries may supply plants for gardens, agriculture, forestry and conservation biology. Some of them specialize in one phase of the process: propagation, growing out, or retail sale; or in one type of plant: e.g., groundcovers, shade plants, or rock garden plants. Some produce bulk stock, whether seedlings or grafted, of particular varieties for purposes such as fruit trees for orchards, or timber trees for forestry. Some produce stock seasonally, ready in springtime for export to colder regions where propagation could not have been started so early, or to regions where seasonal pests prevent profitable growing early in the season. Methods left A tree nursery using gutters to decrease growing costs Nurseries grow plants in open fields, on container fields, in tunnels or greenhouses. In open fields, nurseries grow decorative trees, shrubs and herbaceous perennials. On a containerfield nurseries grow small trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants, usually destined for sales in garden centers. These have proper ventilation, sunlight etc. Plants may be grown by seed(s). The most common method is by cutting plants/plant cuttings. These can be taken from shoot tips or from roots etc. By these methods plants are grown in nurseries and gardens Conditioning With the objective of fitting planting stock more able to withstand stresses after outplanting, various nursery treatmens have been attempted or developed and applied to nursery stock. Buse and Day (1989),Buse, L.J.; Day, R.J. 1989. Conditioning three boreal conifers by root pruning and wrenching. USDA, For. Serv., Tree Plant. Notes 40(2):33‚Äì39. for instance, studied the effect of conditioning of white spruce and black spruce transplants on their morphology, physiology, and subsequent performance after outplanting. Root pruning, wrenching, and fertilization with potassium at 375 kg/ha were the treatments applied. Root pruning and wrenching modified stock in the nursery by decreasing height, root collar diameter, shoot:root ratio, and bud size, but did not improve survival or growth after planting. Fertilization reduced root growth in black spruce but not of white spruce. Hardening off, frost hardiness Seedlings vary in their susceptibility to injury from frost. Damage can be catastrophic if \\"unhardened\\" seedlings are exposed to frost. Frost hardiness may be defined as the minimum temperature at which a certain percentage of a random seedling population will survive or will sustain a given level of damage (Siminovitch 1963, Timmis and Worrall 1975).Siminovitch, D. 1963. Evidence from increase in ribonucleic acid and protein synthesis in autumn for increase in proto plasm during frost hardening of black locust bark cells. Can. J.

The term LT50 (lethal temperature for 50% of a population) is commonly used. Determination of frost hardiness in Ontario is based on electrolyte leakage from mainstem terminal tips 2 cm to 3 cm long in weekly samplings (Colombo and Hickie 1987).Colombo, S.J.; Hickie, D.F. 1987. A one-day test for determining frost hardiness using the electrical conductivity technique. Ont. Min. Nat. Resour., For. Res. Note 45. 4 p. The tips are frozen then thawed, immersed in distilled water, the electrical conductivity of which depends on the degree to which cell membranes have been ruptured by freezing releasing electrolyte. A ‚àí15 ¬∞C frost hardiness level has been used to determine the readiness of container stock to be moved outside from the greenhouse, and ‚àí40 ¬∞C has been the level determining readiness for frozen storage (Colombo 1997).Colombo, S.J. 1997. The role of operational frost hardiness testing in the development of container stock hardening regimes in Ontario. New. For. 13:449‚Äì467. In an earlier technique, potted seedlings were placed in a freezer chest and cooled to some level for some specific duration; a few days after removal, seedlings were assessed for damage using various criteria, including odour, general visual appearance, and examination of cambial tissue (Ritchie 1982).Ritchie, G.A. 1982. Carbohydrate reserves and root growth potential in Douglas-fir seedlings before and after cold storage. Can. J. For. Res. 12:905‚Äì912. Stock for fall planting must be properly hardened-off. Conifer seedlings are considered to be hardened off when the terminal buds have formed and the stem and root tissues have ceased growth. Other characteristics that in some species indicate dormancy are color and stiffness of the needles, but these are not apparent in white spruce. Forest tree nurseries Whether in the forest or in the nursery, seedling growth is fundamentally influenced by soil fertility, but nursery soil fertility is readily amenable to amelioration, much more so than is forest soil. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are regularly supplied as fertilizers, and calcium and magnesium are supplied occasionally. Applications of fertilizer nitrogen do not build up in the soil to develop any appreciable storehouse of available nitrogen for future crops.Armson, K.A.; Carman, R.D. 1961. Forest tree nursery soil management. Ont. Dep. Lands & Forests, Timber Branch, Ottawa ON. 74 p. Phosphorus and potassium, however, can be accumulated as a storehouse available for extended periods. Fertilization permits seedling growth to continue longer through the growing season than unfertilized stock; fertilized white spruce attained twice the height of unfertilized.Armson, K.A. 1966. The growth and absorption of nutrients by fertilized and unfertilized white spruce seedlings. For. Chron. 42(2):127‚Äì136.

Stock types, sizes and lots Nursery stock size typically follows the normal curve when lifted for planting stock. The runts at the lower end of the scale are usually culled to an arbitrary limit, but, especially among bareroot stock, the range in size is commonly considerable. Dobbs (1976)Dobbs, R.C. 1976.

PC 48-357, Exp. 72-F2. 5 p. examined how the performance of 2+0 bareroot white spruce related to differences in initial size of planting stock. The stock was regraded into large, medium, and small fractions according to fresh weight. The small fraction (20% of the original stock) had barely one-quarter of the dry matter mass of the large fraction at the time of outplanting. Ten years later, in the blade-scarified site, seedlings of the large fraction had almost 50% greater stem volume than had seedlings of the small fraction. Without site preparation, large stock were more than twice the size of small stock after 10 years. Nursery of apricot seedlings Similar results were obtained with regraded 2+1 transplants sampled to determine root growth capacity.McMinn, R.G. 1980. Root growth capacity and field performance of various types and sizes of white spruce stock following outplanting in the central interior of British Columbia. p. 37‚Äì41 in Schmidt-Vogt, H. (Ed.).

Field performance of various sizes of white spruce stock in recently cut and backlog sites. Can. For. Serv., Victoria BC, File Rep. PC 48-357, Exp. 78-F1. 4 p. The large stock had higher RGC as well as greater mass than the small stock fraction. The value of large size at the time of planting is especially apparent when outplants face strong competition from other vegetation, although high initial mass does not guarantee success. That the growth potential of planting stock depends on much more than size seems clear from the indifferent success of the transplanting of small 2+0 seedlings for use as 2+1 \\"reclaim\\" transplants. The size of bareroot white spruce seedlings and transplants also had a major influence on field performance. The field performance among various stock types in Ontario plantations was examined by Paterson and Hutchison (1989):Paterson, J.M.; Hutchison, R.E. 1989. Red pine, white pine, white spruce stock type comparisons. Ont. Min. Nat. Resour., For. Res. Note 47. 4 p. the white spruce stock types were 2+0, 1.5+0.5, 1.5+1.5, and 3+0. The nursery stock was grown at Midhurst Forest Tree Nursery, and carefully handled through lifting on 3 lift dates, packing, and hot-planting into cultivated weed-free loam. After 7 years, overall survival was 97%, with no significant differences in survival among stock types. The 1.5+1.5 stock with a mean height of 234 cm was significantly taller by 18% to 25% than the other stock types. The 1.5+1.5 stock also had significantly greater dbh than the other stock types by 30-43%. The best stock type was 57 cm taller and 1 cm greater in dbh than the poorest. Lifting date had no significant effect on growth or survival. High elevation sites in British Columbia's southern mountains are characterized by a short growing season, low air and soil temperatures, severe winters, and deep snow. The survival and growth of Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir outplanted in 3 silvicultural trials on such sites in gaps of various sizes were compared by Lajzerowicz et al. (2006).Lajzerowicz, C.C., Vyse, A., Jull, M., and Newsome, T. 2006. Performance of planted Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir seedlings in British Columbia's southern mountains. For. Chron. 82(1):84‚Äì94 Survival after 5 or 6 years decreased with smaller gaps. Height and diameter also decreased with decreasing size of gap; mean heights were 50 cm to 78 cm after 6 years, in line with height expectations for Engelmann spruce in a high- elevation planting study in southeastern British Columbia.Thompson, C. 1995. Preliminary height expectations of Engelmann spruce plantations for three elevations in the Nelson Forest Region. B.C. Min. For. Nelson For. Region, Res. Sum RS-020. (Cited by Lajzerowicz et al. 2006, orig. not seen.) In the larger gaps (‚â•1.0 ha), height increment by year 6 was ranging from 10 cm to 20 cm. Lajzerrowicz et al. Concluded that plantings of conifers in clearcuts at high elevations in the southern mountains of British Columbia are likely to be successful, even close to timberline; and group selection silvicultural systems based on gaps 0.1 ha or larger are also likely to succeed. Gaps smaller than 0.1 ha do not provide suitable conditions for obtaining adequate survival or for growth of outplanted conifers. Planting stock Planting stock, \\"seedlings, transplants, cuttings, and occasionally wildings, for use in planting out,\\"Ford-Robertson, F.C. (Ed.) 1971. Terminology of Forest Science, Technology, Practice and Products. English language version. Soc. Amer. For., Washington DC. 349 p. is nursery stock that has been made ready for outplanting.The amount of seed used in white spruce seedling production and direct seeding varies with method. A working definition of planting stock quality was accepted at the 1979 IUFRO Workshop on Techniques for Evaluating Planting Stock Quality in New Zealand: \\"The quality of planting stock is the degree to which that stock realizes the objectives of management (to the end of the rotation or achievement of specified sought benefits) at minimum cost. Quality is fitness for purpose.\\"Willen, P.; Sutton, R.F. 1980. Evaluation of planting stock quality: Evaluation of stock after planting. New Zealand J. For. Sci. 10:297‚Äì299. Clear expression of objectives is therefore prerequisite to any determination of planting stock quality.Sutton, R.F. 1982. Plantation establishment in the boreal forest: planting season extension. Can. Dep. Environ., Can. For. Serv., Sault Ste. Marie ON, Inf. Rep. O-X-344. 129 p. Not only does performance have to be determined, but performance has to be rated against the objectives of management.Sutton, R.F. 1987. Plantation establishment in boreal Ontario: a study of spring planting and mechanization. Gov't Can., Can. For. Serv., Sault Ste. Marie ON, Inf. Rep. O-X-383. 26 p. Planting stock is produced in order to give effect to the forest policy of the organization. A distinction needs to be made between \\"planting stock quality\\" and \\"planting stock performance potential\\" (PSPP). The actual performance of any given batch of outplanted planting stock is determined only in part by the kind and condition, i.e., the intrinsic PSPP, of the planting stock. The PSPP is impossible to estimate reliably by eye because outward appearance, especially of stock withdrawn from refrigerated storage, can deceive even experienced foresters, who would be offended if their ability were questioned to recognize good planting stock when they saw it. Prior to Wakeley's (1954)Wakely, P.C. 1954. Planting the southern pines. USDA For. Serv.. Monograph 18. 233 p. demonstration of the importance of the physiological state of planting stock in determining the ability of the stock to perform after outplanting, and to a considerable extent even afterwards, morphological appearance has generally served as the basis for estimating the quality of planting stock. Gradually, however, a realization developed that more was involved. Tucker et al. (1968),Tucker, R.E.; Jarvis, J.M.; Waldron, R.M. 1968. Early survival and growth of white spruce plantations, Riding Mountain National Park, Manitoba. Can. Dep. For. Rural Devel., For. Branch, Ottawa ON, Publ. 1239. 26 p. for instance, after assessing 10-year survival data from several experimental white spruce plantations in Manitoba noted that \\"Perhaps the most important point revealed here is that certain lots of transplants performed better than others\\", even though all transplants were handled and planted with care. The intuitive \\"stock that looks good must be good\\" is a persuasive, but potentially dangerous maxim. That greatest of teachers, Bitter Experience, has often enough demonstrated the fallibility of such assessment, even though the corollary \\"stock that looks bad must be bad\\" is likely to be well founded. The physiological qualities of planting stock are hidden from the eye and must be revealed by testing. The potential for survival and growth of a batch of planting stock may be estimated from various features, morphological and physiological, of the stock or a sample thereof. The size and shape and general appearance of a seedling can nevertheless give useful indications of PSPP. In low-stress outplanting situations, and with a minimized handling and lifting-planting cycle, a system based on specification for nursery stock and minimum morphological standards for acceptable seedlings works tolerably well.Sutton, R.F. 1979. Plantation establishment in the boreal forest: nutrient redistribution during mechanized planting. Can. Dep. Environ., Can. For. Serv., Sault Ste. Marie ON, Inf. Rep. O-X-303. 16 p. (Cited in Coates et al. 1994) In certain circumstances, benefits often accrue from the use of large planting stock of highly ranked morphological grades. Length of leading shoot, diameter of stem, volume of root system, shoot:root ratios, and height:diameter ratios have been correlated with performance under specific site and planting conditions.Mullin, R.E.; Christl, C. 1981. Morphological grading of white spruce nursery stock. For. Chron. 57(3):126‚Äì130. (Cited in Coates et al. 1994). However, the concept that larger is better negates the underlying complexities. Schmidt-Vogt (1980),Schmidt- Vogt, H. (Ed.) 1980. Characterization of plant material. Proc. IUFRO Meet. Div. 1, Freiburg, Germany. for instance, found that whereas mortality among large outplants is greater than among small in the year of planting, mortality in subsequent growing seasons is higher among small outplants than among large. Much of the literature on comparative seedling performance is clouded by uncertainty as to whether the stocks being compared share the same physiological condition; differences invalidate such comparisons.van den Driessche, R. 1976.

The rhizometer ‚Äì a new device for measuring roots of tree seedlings. For. Chron. 44: 21-23. or volume by displacement or gravimetric methods.Burdett, A.N. 1979. New methods for measuring root growth capacity: their value in assessing lodgepole pine stock quality. Can. J. For. Res. 9:63‚Äì67. Planting stock is always subject to a variety of conditions that are never optimal in toto. The effect of sub- optimal conditions is to induce stress in the plants. The nursery manager aims, and is normally able to avoid stresses greater than moderate, i.e., restricting stresses to levels that can be tolerated by the plants without incurring serious damage. The adoption of nursery regimes to equip planting stock with characteristics conferring increased ability to withstand outplanting stresses, by managing stress levels in the nursery to \\"condition\\" planting stock to increase tolerance to various post-planting environmental stresses, has become widespread, particularly with containerized stock. Outplanted stock that is unable to tolerate high temperatures occurring at soil surfaces will fail to establish on many forest sites, even in the far north.Helgerson, O.T. 1990. Heat damage in tree seedlings and its prevention. New For. 3:333‚Äì358. Factors affecting heat tolerance were investigated by Colombo et al.

In black spruce at least, there is an association between HSPs and increased levels of heat tolerance.Coclough, M.L. 1991. The induction of thermotolerance and heat shock protein synthesis in Picea mariana seedlings by heat conditioning. M.Sc. Thesis, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario.Colombo, S.J.; Colclough, M.L.; Timmer, V.R.; Blumwald, E. 1992. Clonal variation in heat tolerance and heat shock protein expression in black spruce. Silvae Gent. 41:234‚Äì239. Investigation of the diurnal variability in heat tolerance of roots and shoots in black spruce seedlings 14 to 16 weeks old found in all 4 trials that shoot heat tolerance was significantly greater in the afternoon than in the morning. The trend in root heat tolerance was similar to that found in the shoots; root systems exposed to 47 ¬∞C for 15 minutes in the afternoon averaged 75 new roots after a 2-week growth period, whereas only 28 new roots developed in root systems similarly exposed in the morning. HSP73 was detected in black spruce nuclear, mitochondrial, microsomal, and soluble protein fractions, while HSP72 was observed only in the soluble protein fraction. Seedlings exhibited constitutive synthesis of HSP73 at 26 ¬∞C in all except the nuclear membrane fraction in the morning; HSP levels at 26 ¬∞C in the afternoon were higher than in the morning in the mitochondrial and microsomal protein factions. Heat shock affected the abundance of HSPs depending on protein fraction and time of day. Without heat shock, nuclear membrane-bound HSP73 was absent from plants in the morning and only weakly present in the afternoon, and heat shock increased the abundance of nuclear membrane. Heat shock also affected the abundance of HSP73 in the afternoon, and caused HSP73 to appear in the morning. In the mitochondrial and microsomal protein fractions, an afternoon heat shock reduced HSP73, whereas a morning heat shock increased HSP73 in the mitochondrial but decreased it in the microsomal fraction. Heat shock increased soluble HSP72/73 levels in both the morning and afternoon. In all instances, shoot and root heat tolerances were significantly greater in the afternoon than in the morning. Planting stock continues to respire during storage even if frozen.Navratil, S. 1982. Storaging of bare-root planting stock. Proc. Fed.‚ÄìProv. Nurserymen's Meet., Smoky Lake AB, Nov. 1982. Alberta Energy & Nat. Resour. 13 p. Temperature is the major factor controlling the rate, and care must be taken to avoid overheating. Navratil (1982) found that closed containers in cold storage averaged internal temperatures 1.5 ¬∞C to 2.0 ¬∞C above the nominal storage temperature. Depletion of reserves can be estimated from the decrease in dry weight. Cold-stored 3+0 white spruce nursery stock in northern Ontario had lost 9% to 16% of dry weight after 40 days of storage. Carbohydrates can also be determined directly. The propensity of a root system to develop new roots or extend existing roots cannot be determined by eye, yet it is the factor that makes or breaks the outcome of an outplanting operation. The post- planting development of roots or root systems of coniferous planting stock is determined by many factors, some physiological, some environmental.Sutton, R.F. 1990. Root growth capacity in coniferous forest trees. HortSci. 25:259‚Äì266. Unsatisfactory rates of post-planting survival unrelated to the morphology of the stock, led to attempts to test the physiological condition of planting stock, particularly to quantify the propensity to produce new root growth. New root growth can be assumed to be necessary for successful establishment of stock after planting, but although the thesis that RGC is positively related to field performance would seem to be reasonable, supporting evidence has been meager. The physiological condition of seedlings is reflected by changes in root activity. This is helpful in determining the readiness of stock for lifting and storing and also for outplanting after storage. Navratil (1982) reported a virtually perfect (R¬≤ = 0.99) linear relationship in the frequency of 3+0 white spruce white root tips longer than 10 mm with time in the fall at Pine Ridge Forest Nursery, Alberta, decreasing during a 3-week period to zero on October 13 in 1982.Root regenerating research with white spruce in Canada (Hambly 1973, Day and MacGillivray 1975, Day and Breunig 1997)Hambly, E.S.L. 1973.

New For. 13:253‚Äì277. debated the proposition that root growth potential of planting stock predicts field performance; their conclusion was that root growth potential, as a surrogate for seedling vigor, can predict field performance, but only under such situations as site conditions permit. Survival after planting is only partly a function of an outplant's ability to initiate roots in test conditions; root growth capacity is not the sole predictor of plantation performance.Scagel, C.F.; Linderman, R.G. 2001. Modification of root IAA concentrations, tree growth, and survival by application of plant growth regulating substances to container-grown conifers. New For. 21:159‚Äì186. Some major problems militate against greater use of RGC in forestry, including: unstandardized techniques; unstandardized quantification; uncertain correlation between quantified RGC and field performance; variability within given, nominally identical, kinds of planting stock; and the irrelevance of RGC test values determined on a sub-sample of a parent population that subsequently, before it is planted, undergoes any substantive physiological or physical change. In its present form, RGC testing is silviculturally useful chiefly as a means of detecting planting stock that, while visually unimpaired, is moribund.Sutton, R.F. 1984. Plantation establishment in the boreal forest: glyphosate, hexazinone, and manual weed control. For. Chron. 60:282‚Äì287. Seedling moisture content can be increased or decreased in storage, depending on various factors including especially the type of container and the kind and amount of moisture-retaining material present. When seedlings exceed 20 bars PMS in storage, survival after outplanting becomes problematical. The Relative Moisture Content of stock lifted during dry conditions can be increased gradually when stored in appropriate conditions. White spruce (3+0) packed in Kraft bags in northern Ontario increased RMC by 20% to 36% within 40 days. Bareroot 1.5+1.5 white spruce were taken from cold storage and planted early in May on a clear-felled boreal forest site in northeastern Ontario.Grossnickle, S.C. 1988.

[Search 8 abstr 38 of 99] Similar plants were potted and kept in a greenhouse. In outplanted trees, maximum stomatal conductances (g) were initially low (<0.01 cm/s), and initial base xylem pressure potentials (PSIb) were -2.0 MPa. During the growing season, g increased to about 0.20 cm/s and PSIb to -1.0 MPa. Minimum xylem pressure potential (PSIm) was initially -2.5 MPa, increasing to -2.0 MPa on day 40, and about -1.6 MPa by day 110. During the first half of the growing season, PSIm was below turgor loss point. The osmotic potential at turgor loss point decreased after planting to -2.3 MPa 28 days later. In the greenhouse, minimum values of PSIT were -2.5 MPa (in the first day after planting. the maximum bulk modulus of elasticity was greater in white spruce than in similarly treated jack pine and showed greater seasonal changes. Relative water content (RWC) at turgor loss was 80-87%. Available turgor (TA), defined as the integral of turgor over the range of RWC between PSIb and xylem pressure potential at the turgor loss point) was 4.0% for white spruce at the beginning of the season compared with 7.9% for jack pine, but for the rest of the season TA for jack pine was only 2%, to 3% that of white spruce. Diurnal turgor (Td), the integral of turgor over the range of RWC between PSIb and PSIm, as a percentage of TA was higher in field-planted white spruce than jack pine until the end of the season. The stomata of both white and black spruce were more sensitive to atmospheric evaporative demands and plant moisture stress during the first growing season after outplanting on 2 boreal sites in northern Ontario than were jack pine stomata,Grossnickle, S.C.; Blake, T.J. 1986.

New For. 1:101‚Äì116. findings warrant mention in relation to the bareroot-containerized debate. During the first growing season after outplanting, containerized seedlings of both species had greater needle conductance than bareroot seedlings over a range of absolute humidity deficits. Needle conductance of containerized seedlings of both species remained high during periods of high absolute humidity deficits and increasing plant moisture stress. Bareroot outplants of both species had a greater early season resistance to water-flow through the soil‚Äìplant‚Äìatmosphere continuum (SPAC) than had containerized outplants. Resistance to water flow through the SPAC decreased in bareroot stock of both species as the season progressed, and was comparable to containerized seedlings 9 to 14 weeks after planting. Bareroot black spruce had greater new-root development than containerized stock throughout the growing season.

Res. 26(6):1015‚Äì1021. helps explain the commonly observed favourable response of young outplants to the nursing effect of a partial canopy. Silvicultural treatments promoting higher humidity levels at the planting microsite should improve white spruce seedling photosynthesis immediately after planting. Stock types (Seedling nomenclature) Planting stock is grown under many diverse nursery culture regimes, in facilities ranging from sophisticated computerized greenhouses to open compounds. Types of stock include bareroot seedlings and transplants, and various kinds of containerized stock. For simplicity, both container-grown and bareroot stock are generally referred to as seedlings, and transplants are nursery stock that have been lifted and transplanted into another nursery bed, usually at wider spacing. The size and physiological character of stock vary with the length of growing period and with growing conditions. Until the technology of raising containerized nursery stock bourgeoned in the second half of the twentieth- century, bareroot planting stock classified by its age in years was the norm. Classification by age The number of years spent in the nursery seedbed by any particular lot of planting stock is indicated by the 1st of a series of numbers. The 2nd number indicates the years subsequently spent in the transplant line, and a zero is shown if indeed there has been no transplanting. A 3rd number, if any, would indicate the years subsequently spent after a second lifting and transplanting. The numbers are sometimes separated by dashes, but separation by plus sign is more logical inasmuch as the sum of the individual numbers gives the age of the planting stock. Thus 2+0 is 2-year-old seedling planting stock that has not been transplanted, and Candy's (1929)Candy, R.H. 1929. Seedlings versus transplants at Petawawa Forest Experiment Station. For. Chron. 5(4):17‚Äì20. white spruce 2+2+3 stock had spent 2 years in the seedbed, 2 years in transplant lines, and another 3 years in transplant lines after a second transplanting. Variations have included such self-explanatory combinations, such as 1¬Ω+1¬Ω, etc. The class of planting stock to use on a particular site is generally selected on the basis of historical record of survival, growth, and total cost of surviving trees.Korstian, C.F.; Baker, F.S. 1925. Forest planting in the Intermountain region. USDA, For. Serv., Washington DC, Agric. Bull. 1264. 56 p. In the Lake States, Kittredge concluded that good stock of 2+1 white spruce was the smallest size likely to succeed and was better than larger and more expensive stock when judged by final cost of surviving trees. Classification by seedling description code Because age alone is an inadequate descriptor of planting stock, various codes have been developed to describe such components of stock characteristics as height, stem diameter, and shoot:root ratio.Cleary, B.D.; Greaves, R.D.; Hermann, R.K. (Compilers and Eds.). 1978. Regenerating Oregon's Forests. Oregon State Univ. Exten. Serv., Corvallis OR. 287 p. A description code may include an indication of the intended planting season. Physiological characteristics Neither age classification nor seedling description code indicate the physiological condition of planting stock, though rigid adherence to a given cultural regime together with observation of performance over a number of years of planting can produce stock suitable for performing on a \\"same again\\" basis. Classification by system Planting stock is raised under a variety of systems, but these have devolved generally into 2 main groupings: bareroot and containerized.

Some languages make this distinction and others do not.  Manner and path  The manner of motion refers to a type of distinct motion described by a particular verb, such as running, tumbling, sliding, walking, crawling, etc. The path of motion refers to the direction of the movement, such as movement into, out of, across, etc. The two concepts can be encoded in the verb as part of its root meaning, or encoded in a separate particle associated with the verb (a \\"satellite\\"). Manner or path may also not be expressed at all. Languages are considered verb-framed or satellite-framed based on how the motion path is typically encoded. English verbs use particles to show the path of motion (\\"run into\\", \\"go out\\", \\"fall down\\"The particles 'into', 'out' and 'down' differ in usage from the same words employed as prepositions because they indicate direction of movement as an attribute of the motion, without specifying location. Together with the verb, they form a phrasal verb. When the same word is linked to a specified location (such as 'run into the garden', 'go out of the house', 'fall down the hole'), it is a preposition introducing a prepositional phrase.), and its verbs usually show manner of motion; thus, English is a satellite-framed language. English verbs that are exceptions are mostly derived from Latin, such as \\"exit\\", \\"ascend\\", or \\"enter\\". All Germanic languages are satellite-framed languages. Accordingly, \\"to go out\\" is hinausgehen in German, uitgaan in Dutch and g√• ut in Swedish, wherein gehen / gaan / g√• are equivalents of \\"to go\\", and hinaus / uit / ut are equivalents of \\"out\\". In this manner, Germanic languages can form all kinds of compounds, even less manifest ones like (German) hinaustanzen \\"to dance out\\" and so on. On the other hand, all Romance languages are verb-framed. Spanish, for example, makes heavy use of verbs of motion like entrar, salir, subir, bajar (\\"go in\\", \\"go out\\", \\"go up\\", \\"go down\\"), which directly encode motion path, and may leave out the manner of motion or express it in a complement of manner (typically a participle): entr√≥ corriendo \\"he ran in\\", literally \\"he entered running\\"; sali√≥ flotando \\"it floated out\\", literally \\"it exited floating\\". The terms verb framing and satellite framing are not restricted to Romance and Germanic languages, respectively. Many languages can be assigned to one of the two systems. For example, verb framing is used in Turkish, Hebrew and Arabic. (In the last, dakhala rƒÅki·∏çan means \\"he entered running\\", with the perfect form dakhala meaning \\"he entered\\" and the participle rƒÅki·∏çan meaning \\"running\\".) Satellite framing is common in Greek. Some languages use both strategies. For example, Persian is chiefly verb-framed, but also has such compounds as dar-ƒÅmadan (, \\"to come in\\") from dar (\\"in\\") and ƒÅmadan (\\"to come\\"). Examples from English and French Romance languages, such as French, are normally verb-framed, and Germanic languages, such as English, are satellite-framed. This means that when expressing motion events, English speakers typically express manner in the verb, and French speakers (like Italian and Spanish speakers) typically express path in the verb, and either leave out the manner of motion completely or express it in a complement of manner. Thus for example, \\"He ran into the room\\" is routinely translated as Il est entr√© dans la pi√®ce; only sometimes will it be Il est entr√© dans la pi√®ce en courant (\\"he entered the room running\\").This was already mentioned in Vinay & Darbelnet (1958) This means, first, that the verb itself normally does not express manner in French, as opposed to what is generally the case in English; and if manner is expressed, it is expressed in a complement (or, more precisely, an adjunct) of manner: en courant (\\"running\\"). The question, then, remains of whether to express manner or not. It is not always easy to know, but manner is generally left unexpressed when it can be considered to be self- evident and can be inferred from the context; expressing the manner then tends to sound unnatural.\\"Users of verb-framed languages specify MANNER in clauses with PATH verbs only when motor pattern or rate of movement is really at issue\\" (Slobin 2004: 8). Thus, \\"He ran into the room\\" can be translated as Il est entr√© dans la pi√®ce en courant because it is slightly unusual to run into a room and so manner should be mentioned, but translating \\"He walked into the room\\" as Il est entr√© dans la pi√®ce √† pied (\\"on foot\\") or en marchant (\\"walking\\") is distinctly odd because it calls unintended attention to the usual way in which one enters a room. It is akin to saying in English \\"he entered the room walking\\". Only in a case where walking would be considered unusual or notable ‚Äì for example, when talking about someone who was riding a bicycle ‚Äì can the fact that he \\"walked\\" into the room be considered to be relevant. Likewise, saying \\"I'm flying to London\\" when on a plane is normal in English, but saying Je vole (\\"I'm flying\\") in French for the same situation is odd: first, because the verb is not where one should normally express manner in the first place, and also because flying is a common way of travelling to London from France. This means that the choice of complement and in particular the choice of the preposition can also be affected: in English, the particle or the prepositional phrase (the \\"satellite\\") is where the path is expressed, with the use of a dynamic preposition: \\"(walk) into (the room)\\", \\"(fly) to (London)\\", whereas in French, it is the verb that normally expresses the path. A preposition like √† (\\"to, at, in\\") is ambiguous between a static reading (Je suis √† Paris/\\"I'm in Paris\\") and a dynamic reading (Je vais √† Paris/\\"I'm going to Paris\\"). If the verb is dynamic and expresses directed motion (motion with an intrinsic direction), √† can express movement (Je vais √† Paris). If not, as is the case for instance with voler (\\"to fly\\"), which expresses manner of motion but not directed motion, √† tends to receive a static and not a dynamic, interpretation: je vole √† Paris would mean something like \\"I'm flying IN Paris\\", and not \\"I'm flying TO Paris\\". Using the same structure in French as directly translated from English can be doubly misleading, as the verb and the preposition are both unusual; Je vais √† (\\"I'm going to\\") or Je suis en route (\\"I am on my way\\") vers/pour Paris (\\"towards/for Paris\\") are much clearer in meaning. Opposition and its limitations Although languages can generally be classified as \\"verb-framed\\"/\\"satellite-framed\\", this is not a mutually- exclusive classification. Languages can use both strategies, as is the case in English with the Latinate verbs such as \\"enter\\", \\"ascend\\" and \\"exit\\". The existence of equipollently-framed languages in which both manner and path are expressed in verbs has been pointed out (Slobin 2004). It could be true of Chinese,Liang Chen, Jiansheng Guo, 2009, Motion events in Chinese novels: Evidence for an equipollently-framed language, Journal of Pragmatics 41 (2009) 1749‚Äì1766 for instance. Many Native American languages, such as the extinct Atsugewi, do not select verbs of motion based on path or manner. Instead, verbs of motion are specific to the kind of object that is moving or being moved.Zheng, M., & Goldin-Meadow, S.

The Georgian Chronicles credits him with being the first monarch founding the kingship of Kartli and the Pharnavazid dynasty, while other independent chronicles, such as The Conversion of Kartli make him the second Georgian monarch. Based on the medieval evidence, most scholars locate Pharnavaz's rule in the 3rd century BC: 302‚Äì237 BC according to Prince Vakhushti of Kartli, 299‚Äì234 BC according to Cyril Toumanoff and 284‚Äì219 BC according to Pavle Ingoroqva.Rapp, p. 274. Pharnavaz's rise, advent and imperial expansion of the Iberian monarchy was directly tied to the victory of Alexander the Great over the Achaemenid Empire.Rapp (2014), p. 203Rayfield (2013), p. 23 Pharnavaz ruled under the suzerainty of the Seleucid Empire.Rayfield (2013), pp. 22-23 Life According to the Georgian royal annals, Pharnavaz descended from Uplos, son of Mtskhetos, son of Kartlos, who was one of the powerful and famous eight brothers, who from their part were descendants of Targamos, son of Tarsi, the grandson of Japheth, son of the Biblical Noah. He is not directly attested in non-Georgian sources and there is no definite contemporary indication that he was indeed the first of the Georgian kings. His story is saturated with legendary imagery and symbols, and it seems feasible that, as the memory of the historical facts faded, the real Pharnavaz \\"accumulated a legendary fa√ßade\\" and emerged as the model pre- Christian monarch in the Georgian annals.Rapp, p. 276. According to the c. 800 chronicle The Life of Kings, Pharnavaz had a distinguished genealogy, tracing back to Kartlos, the mythical ethnarch of Kartli.Rayfield (2013), p. 15 His paternal uncle, Samara, held the position of mamasakhlisi (\\"father of the house\\") of the Georgian tribes around Mtskheta.Georgian royal annals, page of edition 20, line of edition 17-18-19 Pharnavaz's mother is claimed to have been a Persian woman from Spahan,Rapp (2014), p. 205-239 whom Prince Teimuraz of Georgia and Patriarch Anton I of Georgia identify with a daughter of King Darius III.Prince Royal Teimuraz, History of Iberia or Georgia, that is All of Sakartvelo, 1832, pp. 111-112 The entire story of Pharnavaz, although written by a Christian chronicler, abounds in ancient Iranian-like imagery and mystic allusions, a reflection of the archaeologically confirmed cultural and presumably political ties between Iran and Kartli of that time. The name \\"Pharnavaz\\" is also an illustrative example with its root par- being based upon the Persian farnah, the divine radiance believed by the ancient Iranians to mark a legitimate dynast (cf. khvarenah).Rapp, pp. 275-276. The dynastic tag Parnavaziani (\\"of/from/named for Pharnavaz\\") is also preserved in the early Armenian histories as P'arnawazean (Faustus of Byzantium 5.15; fifth century) and P'arazean (History of Armenia 14; probably the early fifth century), an acknowledgment that a king named Pharnavaz was understood to have been the founder of a Georgian dynasty.Rayfield (2013), p. 22 Pharnavaz is also mentioned in the Stele of Serapit.Gamkrelidze, p. 122Rapp (2014), p. 216 Perhaps the most artistically rounded section of the Georgian annals, the narrative follows Pharnavaz's life from birth to burial.Rayfield, p. 60. Aged 3,Toumanoff, p. 8Rapp (2014), p. 205 small Pharnavaz's family is destroyed, and his heritage is usurped by Azon installed by Alexander the Great during his campaign in Kartli. Alexander's invasion of Iberia, remembered not only by the Georgian historical tradition, but also by Pliny the Elder (4.10.39) and Gaius Julius Solinus (9.19), appears to be memory of some Macedonian interference in Iberia, which must have taken place in connection with the expedition mentioned by Strabo (11.14.9) sent by Alexander in 323 BC to the confines of Iberia, in search of gold mines. Pharnavaz is brought up fatherless, but a magic dream, in which he anoints himself with the essence of the Sun, heralds the peripeteia. He is persuaded by this vision to \\"devote [himself] to noble deeds\\". He then sets off and goes hunting. In a pursuit of a deer, he encounters a mass of treasure stored in a hidden cave.Rayfield, p. 61; Rapp, p. 276. Pharnavaz retrieves the treasure and exploits it to mount a loyal army against the tyrannical Azon. He is aided by Kuji of Colchis, who eventually marries Pharnavaz's sister.Georgian royal annals, page of edition 24, line of edition 3 The rebels are also joined by 1,000 soldiers from Azon's camp; they are anachronistically referred to by the author as Romans, and claimed to have been entitled by the victorious Pharnavaz as aznauri (i.e., nobles) after Azon (this etymology is false, however). The main threads of Pharnavaz's story - a fatherless boy hidden and raised in a remote mountains, a forgotten lineage, his dreams, sacral kingship, solar imagery, the hunt, discovery of cave-concealed treasure etc. are reminiscent of legends about Iran's founding kings, like Cyrus the Great and Ardashir I.Rapp (2014), p. 208 Pharnavaz's self-anointment may have been a later Sasanian inspiration, as some early Shahanshahs crowned themselves.Rapp (2014), p. 209 Reign The kingdom's borders per the Georgian royal annals. In the ensuing battle, Azon is defeated and killed, and Pharnavaz becomes the king of Kartli at the age of 27. He is reported to have acknowledged the suzerainty of the Seleucids, the Hellenistic successors of Alexander in the Middle East, who are afforded by the Georgian chronicles the generic name of Antiochus. Pharnavaz is also said to have patterned his administration upon an \\"Iranian\\" model.Rapp, p. 275. Pharnavaz had introduced a military-administrative organization based on a network of regional governors or eristavi.Rapp, p. 277; Suny, p. 12. The insignia of the eristavi, received from the king, constituted a sceptre, a special signet ring, belt and armament.Gamkrelidze, p. 134 Iberia had in total seven eristavis, in Colchis,Georgian royal annals, page of edition 24, line of edition 9-11 Kakheti,Georgian royal annals, page of edition 24, line of edition 12-13 KhunaniGeorgian royal annals, page of edition 24, line of edition 14-15 (modern-day northern Azerbaijan), SamshvildeGeorgian royal annals, page of edition 24, line of edition 16-17 (Kvemo Kartli), TsundaGeorgian royal annals, page of edition 24, line of edition 18-19 (included Javakheti, Kola and Artaani), OdzrkheGeorgian royal annals, page of edition 24, line of edition 20-21 and Klarjeti.Georgian royal annals, page of edition 24, line of edition 22-23 The kingdom had one spaspet who was under the direct control of the royal power based in Inner Kartli.Georgian royal annals, page of edition 24, line of edition 24-25; page of edition 25, line of edition 2-3 Eristavates mimicked aspects of Achaemenid satrapies and Seleucid strategoi. The major motive of later historian of the chronicles was to convince posterity that the basic political structure of Kartli was created by the very first Georgian monarch in the wake of Wars of Alexander the Great; was of Achaemenid administrative system and had remained stable throughout Hellenistic, Parthian and Sasanian times. In this way, the long-term viability and stability of the Georgian realm are established.Rapp (2014), p. 212 The hierarchic structure created by Pharnavaz was the following: king; commander- in-chief (spaspet) of the royal army; eristavis; middle commanders (atasistavis tsikhistavis) of the garrisons stationed in the royal strongholds; junior commanders (asistavis) who were the younger sons of the aristocratic families; mercenary professional warriors from the neighboring countries and all the soldiers organized around the entire kingdom.Gamkrelidze, p. 135 It is evident that the division of Iberia by Pharnavaz into saeristavos served first and foremost a military aim, namely the organization of people for the purpose of defence. This organization was not so much directed against other countries. Back then the total population of the kingdom would have been, including foreign captives and the population of the tributary areas, about 600,000, which could raise a fairly big army not less than 100,000. According to Strabo the Iberian army numbered 70‚Äì80,000 so it appears that each saeristavo had 10,000 soldiers.Henri J. M. Claessen, Peter Skalnik, The Early State, p. 263 While Georgian and Classical evidence makes the contemporaneous Kartlian links with the Seleucids plausible (Toumanoff has even implied that the kings of Kartli might have aided the Seleucids in holding the resurgent Orontids of Armenia in checkToumanoff, p. 185.), Pharnavaz's alleged reform of the eristavi fiefdoms is most likely a back-projection of the medieval pattern of subdivision to the remote past.Rapp, p. 277. Pharnavaz is then reported to have embarked on social and cultural projects; he supervised two building projects: the raising of the idol Armazi ‚Äì reputedly named after him ‚Äì on a mountain ledge and the construction of a similarly named fortress. Pharnavaz made alliances with various North Caucasian peoples during his reign, to whom he called upon for help against both Macedonia and internal foes. He took a Durdzuk woman in marriage, in order to consolidate the alliance of Iberia with the Durdzuks, who helped him consolidate his reign against his unruly vassals.Georgian royal annals, page of edition 25, line of edition 5 Similarly he married his sister to a Sarmatian chief.Georgian royal annals, page of edition 24, line of edition 2 According to the Georgian royal annals he also created the Georgian script and made the Georgian language an official language of the kingdom:Georgian royal annals, page of edition 26, line of edition 8-9-10 The chronicles report Pharnavaz's lengthy reign of 65 years.Georgian royal annals, page of edition 25, line of edition 14 Upon his death, he was buried in front of the idol Armazi and worshipped. His son Saurmag succeeded him to the throne.Rapp, p. 280.Georgian royal annals, page of edition 26, line of edition 13Rayfield (2013), p. 24 Pharnavaz's grave is undisclosed so far. One of the last monarchs who visited his grave to adorn it and pay his respects was King Mirian III.Georgian royal annals, page of edition 65, line of edition 19 Pharnavaz's very burial in front of idol Armazi suggests a Hellenistic deification of the early monarchs of Iberia. Pharnavaz and Arrian's Pharasmanes Several modern scholars have been tempted to make identification between the Pharnavaz of the medieval Georgian tradition and the Pharasmanes of the Greco-Roman historian Arrian, a 2nd-century AD author of The Anabasis of Alexander. Arrian recounts that \\"Pharasmanes (–§Œ±œÅŒ±œÉŒºŒ¨ŒΩŒ∑œÇ), king of the Chorasmians\\", visited Alexander the Great with 1500 horseman, and pledged his support should Alexander desire to campaign to the Euxine lands and subdue Colchians, whom Pharasmanes names as his neighbors. Apart from the similarity of the names of Pharasmanes and Pharnavaz (both names are apparently based on the same root, the Iranian farnah), the king of Chorasmia in Central Asia reports Colchis (today's western Georgia, i.e., the western neighbor of ancient Kartli/Iberia) to be a neighboring country.Rapp, p. 279.

One pretends to remove one or more balls from the urn; the goal is to determine the probability of drawing one color or another, or some other properties. A number of important variations are described below. An urn model is either a set of probabilities that describe events within an urn problem, or it is a probability distribution, or a family of such distributions, of random variables associated with urn problems.Dodge, Yadolah (2003) Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms, OUP.  Basic urn model  In this basic urn model in probability theory, the urn contains x white and y black balls, well-mixed together. One ball is drawn randomly from the urn and its color observed; it is then placed back in the urn (or not), and the selection process is repeated. Possible questions that can be answered in this model are: * Can I infer the proportion of white and black balls from n observations? With what degree of confidence? * Knowing x and y, what is the probability of drawing a specific sequence (e.g. one white followed by one black)? * If I only observe n balls, how sure can I be that there are no black balls? (A variation on the first question) Examples of urn problems * binomial distribution: the distribution of the number of successful draws (trials), i.e. extraction of white balls, given n draws with replacement in an urn with black and white balls. * beta-binomial distribution: as above, except that every time a ball is observed, an additional ball of the same color is added to the urn. Hence, the number of total marbles in the urn grows. See P√≥lya urn model. * multinomial distribution: the urn contains balls in more than two colors. * hypergeometric distribution: the balls are not returned to the urn once extracted. Hence, the number of total marbles in the urn decreases. This is referred to as \\"drawing without replacement\\", by opposition to \\"drawing with replacement\\". * multivariate hypergeometric distribution: as above, but with balls of more than two colors. * geometric distribution: number of draws before the first successful (correctly colored) draw. * negative binomial distribution: number of draws before a certain number of failures (incorrectly colored draws) occurs. * Statistical physics: derivation of energy and velocity distributions. * The Ellsberg paradox. * P√≥lya urn: each time a ball of a particular colour is drawn, it is replaced along with an additional ball of the same colour. * Hoppe urn: a P√≥lya urn with an additional ball called the mutator. When the mutator is drawn it is replaced along with an additional ball of an entirely new colour. * Occupancy problem: the distribution of the number of occupied urns after the random assignment of k balls into n urns. Historical remarks In Ars Conjectandi (1713), Jacob Bernoulli considered the problem of determining, given a number of pebbles drawn from an urn, the proportions of different colored pebbles within the urn. This problem was known as the inverse probability problem, and was a topic of research in the eighteenth century, attracting the attention of Abraham de Moivre and Thomas Bayes. Bernoulli used the Latin word urna, which primarily means a clay vessel, but is also the term used in ancient Rome for a vessel of any kind for collecting ballots or lots; the present-day Italian word for ballot box is still urna. Bernoulli's inspiration may have been lotteries, elections, or games of chance which involved drawing balls from a container, and it has been asserted that > Elections in medieval and renaissance Venice, including that of the doge, > often included the choice of electors by lot, using balls of different > colors drawn from an urn.

During the war, she was credited with sinking 13 Japanese ships (including two destroyers, a light cruiser, and the aircraft carrier ) and damaging another five; not all of these credits were confirmed by postwar JANAC accounting. She also holds the distinction of sinking the highest warship tonnage of any U.S. submarine. She was lost in 1944, probably sunk by a mine off northern Hokkaid≈ç on 7 November. Albacore was the second vessel of the United States Navy to be named for the albacore. Her keel was laid on 21 April 1941 by the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 17 February 1942 (sponsored by Mrs. Elise Riles Cutts, the wife of Captain Elvin F. Cutts), and commissioned on 1 June 1942, Lieutenant Commander Richard C. Lake (Class of 1929) in command. Service history=World War II1942= Following shakedown, the submarine proceeded via the Panama Canal to Pearl Harbor and, from that base on 28 August 1942, began her first war patrol, to waters of the north and northeast pass through the coral reef which surrounds Truk. On 13 September, Albacore sighted two cargo vessels in column and prepared for her first combat action. She made a submerged approach and fired three torpedoes at the leading ship and two at the second. One or two torpedoes hit on the first ship; none struck the second. Albacore claimed to have damaged the leading vessel. Her next enemy contact came on 1 October when she made a night surface attack on a Japanese tanker. She expended seven torpedoes and scored two hits. Although the tanker appeared to be low in the water, she was still able to leave the scene under her own power. On 9 October, Albacore spotted a Sh≈çkaku-class aircraft carrier escorted by a heavy cruiser and a destroyer, but the submarine was depth charged by the escorts and forced to break off her pursuit. The next day, she attacked a freighter. One torpedo hit the mark, and 12 minutes after firing, the sound of two heavy explosions caused the submarine's crew to presume they had downed the vessel. Beginning on the mid- morning of 11 October, Albacore was depth charged numerous times. At 1548, the conning officer finally spotted the Japanese attackers, two submarine chasers and an airplane. A third ship equipped with sound gear joined the group and continued the hunt. The ships crisscrossed over Albacore, close enough for propeller noise to reverberate throughout her hull and compelled her to proceed at silent running, with her ventilator fans shut down. After a chase of nearly seven hours, the Japanese ships disappeared astern, and Albacore then surfaced to clear the immediate area. The next day, Albacore headed for Midway Island. Although she had had several opportunities to score during the patrol, Albacore was not credited with any damage to Japanese shipping. The submarine arrived at Midway Island on 20 October and commenced a refit. Tenryu in Yokosuka 1925. With her refurbishing completed and a new Oerlikon 20 mm cannon installed, Albacore sailed on 11 November for her second patrol. Her assigned areas were the St. George's Channel, New Britain, along the east coast of New Guinea to Vitiaz Strait, and the Dallman Pass off Madang harbor. On 24 November, the submarine spotted a convoy of two cargo vessels. Albacore maneuvered into position and fired two stern tubes, but neither torpedo found its target. Two days later, on 26 November, Albacore herself became the quarry. Two Japanese destroyers depth charged her and the explosions caused numerous small leaks around the cable packing glands in the pressure hull. After a two-hour chase, the Japanese retired, and Albacore shifted her patrol area to Vitiaz Strait. Another golden opportunity arose on 13 December, when Albacore found three Japanese destroyers. She released a three-torpedo spread but again was unsuccessful. On 18 December, Albacore was stationed off Madang. The submarine discovered what seemed to be a transport and a destroyer. Albacore torpedoed the \\"transport,\\" and it exploded in a mass of flames and sank. Albacore had in fact downed the light cruiser , the second Japanese cruiser sunk by an American submarine in World War II. Albacore put into port at Brisbane, Australia, on 30 December. =1943= Japanese destroyer ≈åshio. After an overhaul of her engines, Albacore got underway on 20 January 1943 to begin her third patrol. Off the north coast of New Guinea, she spotted 11 targets in as many days. The first group, encountered on 20 February, consisted of a destroyer and a frigate escorting a minelayer. Albacore fired ten torpedoes and believed she had sunk the destroyer, Oshio and damaged the frigate. In the following days, Albacore attacked one tanker, several freighters, and another destroyer. Of eight torpedoes expended during these actions, all missed their targets. When Albacore ended her patrol at Brisbane on 11 March, she was credited with sinking one destroyer and a frigate for a total of 2,250 tons. Albacore was briefly dry-docked for repairs and underwent refresher training before sailing for a fourth patrol on 6 April. This time, her area was around the Solomon Islands and Bismarck Islands and off the north coast of New Guinea. While she sighted several convoys, she recorded no hits. Albacore returned to Brisbane on 26 May. While Albacore was being refitted at that port, Lieutenant Commander Oscar E. Hagberg relieved Lieutenant Commander Lake in command of the submarine. On 16 June, Albacore was underway for her fifth patrol and waters surrounding the Bismarcks and the Solomons. During this patrol, she sighted three separate convoys and attacked two. Albacore claimed to have damaged a transport on 19 July but the submarine failed to sink any vessels. Albacore arrived back at Brisbane and began a refit alongside . On 23 August, Albacore left to patrol roughly the same area as on her previous assignment. She spotted a Japanese submarine on 31 August but was unable to press home an attack. On 4 September, she encountered a two-ship convoy protected by two escorts and sank one of the ships, the auxiliary gunboat Heijo Maru, with three torpedo hits made shortly after the initial contact. The submarine then pursued the other vessel for the next two days but was able to inflict only minor hull damage on her target. She terminated her patrol at Brisbane on 26 September. Albacores seventh patrol began on 12 October 1943. She fired six torpedoes at a large merchant ship on 25 October but recorded no hits. On 6 November, she received a report of a convoy which had been spotted by , and began to search for it. On 8 November, the submarine found the convoy and started to track it. However, a plane from the Fifth Army Air Force bombed her and caused her to lose contact with the Japanese ships. The submarine sustained no damage. Albacore was again bombed by American aircraft on 10 November. This time, the submarine suffered considerable damage. All auxiliary power was knocked out, and the submarine was plunged into total darkness. The main induction valve went under water before it was shut, and it began filling up with water. Albacore plunged to a depth of before her dive was checked. For the next two and one-half hours, she bounced between and while at various attitudes. She finally managed to return to the surface with her trim almost restored. The submarine re-submerged, and it was decided to continue the patrol while simultaneously making necessary repairs. Following this ordeal, Albacore received orders to locate and attack the cruiser , which had been hit and damaged by . Albacore found Agano on 12 November and tried to attack, but Japanese destroyers held the submarine down with a four-hour depth charge barrage. On 25 November, Albacore sank Japanese army transport Kenzan Maru. On her return to Brisbane on 5 December, Lieutenant Commander James W. Blanchard replaced Hagberg in command. Sazanami 15 April 1940. Albacore departed Australia on 26 December to patrol north of the Bismarck Islands. She spotted her first target on 12 January 1944 and sank Choko Maru with two separate torpedo attacks. Two days later, in company with and , she blew up (flushed by Guardfish);Blair, Clay, Jr. Silent Victory (Philadelphia: Lippincott, 1975), p.484. the sinking was achieved by four torpedoes from Albacores stern tubes. Another destroyer pinned Albacore down and delivered fifty-nine depth charges, leaving Scamp and Guardfish free to pursue the three tankers; they succeeded in sinking one each.Blair, p.484. Following more than a fortnight of uneventful patrolling, the submarine headed home. She made brief fuel stops at Tulagi and Midway Island before reaching Pearl Harbor on 22 February. After three days of repairs to get her ready for the voyage, Albacore continued on to the Mare Island Navy Yard in Vallejo, California for overhaul. =1944= Taih≈ç. Albacore off Mare Island on 28 April 1944. She had just finished 2 months of overhaul after her eighth war patrol. Albacore off Mare Island on 28 April 1944. Albacore left Mare Island on 5 May 1944 and held training exercises with USS Shad en route to Hawaii. Albacore reached Pearl Harbor on 13 May and spent the next two weeks on final repairs and training. Albacore began her ninth patrol on 29 May, and was assigned waters west of the Mariana Islands and around the Palau Islands. In the next few days, she made only one contact, a Japanese convoy which she encountered on 11 June. But before the submarine could maneuver into attack position, a Japanese aircraft forced her to dive and lose contact. =The Sinking of Taih≈ç= On the morning of 18 June, two days after American forces began landing on Saipan, Albacore shifted from her position west of the Mariana Islands to a new location further south. Admiral Charles Andrews Lockwood (ComSubPac)Blair, p.654. ordered this move in the hope of enabling the submarine to intercept a Japanese task force (under command of Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa) reportedly steaming from Tawi Tawi toward Saipan. At about 0800 the next morning, Albacore raised her periscope and found herself in the midst of Ozawa's main carrier group. Blanchard allowed one Japanese carrier to pass unharmed and selected a second one for his target. Once inside , the submarine's Torpedo Data Computer started giving false information. To maximize the odds of a hit, Blanchard fired all six bow tubes. The carrier was in the process of launching an air strike, and one of the pilots (Sakio Komatsu) intentionally dove his plane into a torpedo, setting it off early. Three Japanese destroyers immediately charged Albacore. While the submarine was diving to escape, her crew heard one solid torpedo explosion. About that same time, 25 depth charges began raining down on the submarine. Then Blanchard heard \\"a distant and persistent explosion of great force\\" followed by another.Blair, p. 628. No one on Albacore thought Taih≈ç had sunk, and her skipper was angry for \\"missing a golden opportunity.\\" After this action, Albacore was assigned lifeguard duty for planes striking Yap and Ulithi. On 2 July, Albacore shifted over to intercept traffic between Yap and the Palau Islands. The submarine spotted a wooden inter-island steamer loaded with Japanese civilians. Albacore decided to stage a surface gun attack. After ensuring the ship was afire, Albacore dived to avoid an airplane. The submarine surfaced soon thereafter and picked up five survivors. The sunken vessel was the Taimei Maru from Yap to PalauUS Navy Chronology 3 July 1944 Albacore put into Majuro on 15 July. She was praised for an aggressive patrol and received credit for damaging a Sh≈çkaku-class carrier. American codebreakers lost track of Taih≈ç after the Battle of the Philippine Sea and, while puzzled, did not realize she had gone down. Only months later did a prisoner of war reveal her sinking. After a refit alongside , the submarine began her tenth patrol on 8 August. Her assignment was the Bungo Suido-Kii Suido area, and, during this period, Albacore was credited with sinking two Japanese vessels, an 880-ton cargo ship Shingetau Maru on September 5 and 170 ton Submarine Chaser #165 on September 11. The patrol ended at Pearl Harbor on 25 September. =Loss= Albacore left Pearl Harbor on 24 October 1944 (with Hugh Raynor Rimmer, Class of 1937,Blair, p.959. in command), topped up her fuel tanks at Midway Island on 28 October, and was never heard from again. According to Japanese records captured after the war, a submarine (presumed to be Albacore) struck a naval mine very close to the shore off northeastern Hokkaid≈ç on 7 November 1944. A Japanese patrol boat witnessed the explosion of a submerged submarine and saw a great deal of heavy oil, cork, bedding, and food supplies rise to the surface. On 21 December, Albacore was presumed lost with all hands. Her name was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 March 1945. Awards Albacore won nine battle stars for her service and the Presidential Unit Citation for her second, third, eighth, and ninth patrols during World War II.

Although the noble gases are generally unreactive elements, many such compounds have been observed, particularly involving the element xenon. From the standpoint of chemistry, the noble gases may be divided into two groups: the relatively reactive krypton (ionisation energy 14.0 eV), xenon (12.1 eV), and radon (10.7 eV) on one side, and the very unreactive argon (15.8 eV), neon (21.6 eV), and helium (24.6 eV) on the other. Consistent with this classification, Kr, Xe, and Rn form compounds that can be isolated in bulk at or near standard temperature and pressure (at least in principle for the highly radioactive radon), whereas He, Ne, Ar have been observed to form true chemical bonds using spectroscopic techniques, but only when frozen into a noble gas matrix at temperatures of 40 K or lower, in supersonic jets of noble gas, or under extremely high pressures with metals. The heavier noble gases have more electron shells than the lighter ones. Hence, the outermost electrons are subject to a shielding effect from the inner electrons that makes them more easily ionized, since they are less strongly attracted to the positively charged nucleus. This results in an ionization energy low enough to form stable compounds with the most electronegative elements, fluorine and oxygen, and even with less electronegative elements such as nitrogen and carbon under certain circumstances. History and background When the family of noble gases was first identified at the end of the nineteenth century, none of them was observed to form any compounds and it was initially believed that they were all inert gases (as they were then known) which could not form compounds. With the development of atomic theory in the early twentieth century, their inertness was ascribed to a full valence shell of electrons which render them very chemically stable and nonreactive. All noble gases have full s and p outer electron shells (except helium, which has no p sublevel), and so do not form chemical compounds easily. Their high ionization energy and almost zero electron affinity explain their non-reactivity. In 1933, Linus Pauling predicted that the heavier noble gases would be able to form compounds with fluorine and oxygen. Specifically, he predicted the existence of krypton hexafluoride (KrF6) and xenon hexafluoride (XeF6), speculated that XeF8 might exist as an unstable compound, and suggested that xenic acid would form perxenate salts. These predictions proved quite accurate, although subsequent predictions for XeF8 indicated that it would be not only thermodynamically unstable, but kinetically unstable. As of 2013, XeF8 has not been made, although the octafluoroxenate(VI) anion () has been observed. By 1960, no compound with a covalently bound noble gas atom had yet been synthesized. The first published report, in June 1962, of a noble gas compound was by Neil Bartlett, who noticed that the highly oxidising compound platinum hexafluoride ionised O2 to . As the ionisation energy of O2 to (1165 kJ mol‚àí1) is nearly equal to the ionisation energy of Xe to Xe+ (1170 kJ mol‚àí1), he tried the reaction of Xe with PtF6. This yielded a crystalline product, xenon hexafluoroplatinate, whose formula was proposed to be . It was later shown that the compound is actually more complex, containing both XeFPtF5 and XeFPt2F11. Nonetheless, this was the first real compound of any noble gas. The first binary noble gas compounds were reported later in 1962. Bartlett synthesized xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) by subjecting a mixture of xenon and fluorine to high temperature. Rudolf Hoppe, among other groups, synthesized xenon difluoride (XeF2) by the reaction of the elements. Following the first successful synthesis of xenon compounds, synthesis of krypton difluoride () was reported in 1963. True noble gas compounds In this section, the non- radioactive noble gases are considered in decreasing order of atomic weight, which generally reflects the priority of their discovery, and the breadth of available information for these compounds. The radioactive elements radon and oganesson are harder to study and are considered at the end of the section. Xenon compounds After the initial 1962 studies on XeF4 and XeF2, xenon compounds that have been synthesized include other fluorides (XeF6), oxyfluorides (XeOF2, XeOF4, XeO2F2, XeO3F2, XeO2F4) and oxides (, XeO3 and XeO4). Xenon fluorides react with several other fluorides to form fluoroxenates, such as sodium octafluoroxenate (), and fluoroxenonium salts, such as trifluoroxenonium hexafluoroantimonate (). In terms of other halide reactivity, short-lived excimers of noble gas halides such as XeCl2 or XeCl are prepared in situ, and are used in the function of excimer lasers. Recently, xenon has been shown to produce a wide variety of compounds of the type XeOnX2 where n is 1,2 or 3 and X is any electronegative group, such as CF3, C(SO2CF3)3, N(SO2F)2, N(SO2CF3)2, OTeF5, O(IO2F2), etc.; the range of compounds is impressive, similar to that seen with the neighbouring element iodine, running into the thousands and involving bonds between xenon and oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, boron and even gold, as well as perxenic acid, several halides, and complex ions. The compound Xe2+Sb4F21‚àí contains a Xe‚ÄìXe bond, which is the longest element-element bond known (308.71 pm = 3.0871 √Ö). Short-lived excimers of Xe2 are reported to exist as a part of the function of excimer lasers. Krypton compounds Krypton gas reacts with fluorine gas under extreme forcing conditions, forming KrF2 according to the following equation: ::Kr + F2 ‚Üí KrF2 KrF2 reacts with strong Lewis acids to form salts of the KrF+ and Kr cations. The preparation of reported by Grosse in 1963, using the Claasen method, was subsequently shown to be a mistaken identification. Krypton compounds with other than Kr-F bonds (compounds with atoms other than fluorine) have also been described. reacts with to produces the unstable compound, , with a krypton-oxygen bond. A krypton-nitrogen bond is found in the cation [HC‚â°N‚ÄìKr‚ÄìF], produced by the reaction of with [HC‚â°NH][AsF] below ‚àí50 ¬∞C. Argon compounds The discovery of HArF was announced in 2000. The compound can exist in low temperature argon matrices for experimental studies, and it has also been studied computationally. Argon hydride ion was obtained in the 1970s. This molecular ion has also been identified in the Crab nebula, based on the frequency of its light emissions. There is a possibility that a solid salt of ArF+ could be prepared with or anions. Neon and helium compounds The ions, Ne+, (NeAr)+, (NeH)+, and (HeNe+) are known from optical and mass spectrometric studies. Neon also forms an unstable hydrate. There is some empirical and theoretical evidence for a few metastable helium compounds which may exist at very low temperatures or extreme pressures. The stable cation HeH+ was reported in 1925, but was not considered a true compound since it is not neutral and cannot be isolated. In 2016 scientists created the helium compound disodium helide (Na2He) which was the first helium compound discovered. Radon and oganesson compounds Radon is not chemically inert, but its short half-life (3.8 days for Rn222) and the high energy of its radioactivity make it difficult to investigate its only fluoride (RnF2), its reported oxide (RnO3), and their reaction products. Oganesson isotopes have even shorter half-lives in the millisecond range and no compounds are known yet, although some have been predicted theoretically. It is expected to be even more reactive than radon, more like a normal element than a noble gas in its chemistry. Reports prior to xenon hexafluoroplatinate and xenon tetrafluoride =Clathrates Kr(H2)4 and H2 solids formed in a diamond anvil cell. Ruby was added for pressure measurement. Structure of Kr(H2)4. Krypton octahedra (green) are surrounded by randomly oriented hydrogen molecules. Prior to 1962, the only isolated compounds of noble gases were clathrates (including clathrate hydrates); other compounds such as coordination compounds were observed only by spectroscopic means. Clathrates (also known as cage compounds) are compounds of noble gases in which they are trapped within cavities of crystal lattices of certain organic and inorganic substances. The essential condition for their formation is that the guest (noble gas) atoms should be of appropriate size to fit in the cavities of the host crystal lattice; for instance, Ar, Kr, and Xe can form clathrates with crystalline Œ≤-quinol, but He and Ne cannot fit because they are too small. As well, Kr and Xe can appear as guests in crystals of melanophlogite. Helium-nitrogen (He(N2)11) crystals have been grown at room temperature at pressures ca. 10 GPa in a diamond anvil cell. Solid argon- hydrogen clathrate (Ar(H2)2) has the same crystal structure as the MgZn2 Laves phase. It forms at pressures between 4.3 and 220 GPa, though Raman measurements suggest that the H2 molecules in Ar(H2)2 dissociate above 175 GPa. A similar Kr(H2)4 solid forms at pressures above 5 GPa. It has a face- centered cubic structure where krypton octahedra are surrounded by randomly oriented hydrogen molecules. Meanwhile, in solid Xe(H2)8 xenon atoms form dimers inside solid hydrogen. Coordination compounds Coordination compounds such as Ar¬∑BF3 have been postulated to exist at low temperatures, but have never been confirmed. Also, compounds such as WHe2 and HgHe2 were reported to have been formed by electron bombardment, but recent research has shown that these are probably the result of He being adsorbed on the surface of the metal; therefore, these compounds cannot truly be considered chemical compounds. Hydrates Hydrates are formed by compressing noble gases in water, where it is believed that the water molecule, a strong dipole, induces a weak dipole in the noble gas atoms, resulting in dipole-dipole interaction. Heavier atoms are more influenced than smaller ones, hence Xe‚Ä¢5.75 H2O was reported to have been the most stable hydrate; Reprinted as it has a melting point of 24 ¬∞C. The deuterated version of this hydrate has also been produced. Fullerene adducts right Noble gases can also form endohedral fullerene compounds where the noble gas atom is trapped inside a fullerene molecule. In 1993, it was discovered that when C60 is exposed to a pressure of around 3 bar of He or Ne, the complexes He@C60 and Ne@C60 are formed. Under these conditions, only about one out of every 650,000 C60 cages was doped with a helium atom; with higher pressures (3000 bar), it is possible to achieve a yield of up to 0.1%. Endohedral complexes with argon, krypton and xenon have also been obtained, as well as numerous adducts of He@C60. Applications Most applications of noble gas compounds are either as oxidising agents or as a means to store noble gases in a dense form. Xenic acid is a valuable oxidising agent because it has no potential for introducing impurities‚Äîxenon is simply liberated as a gas‚Äîand so is rivalled only by ozone in this regard. The perxenates are even more powerful oxidizing agents. Xenon-based oxidants have also been used for synthesizing carbocations stable at room temperature, in solution. Stable salts of xenon containing very high proportions of fluorine by weight (such as tetrafluoroammonium heptafluoroxenate, NF4XeF7, and the related tetrafluoroammonium octafluoroxenate (NF4)2XeF8), have been developed as highly energetic oxidisers for use as propellants in rocketry. Karl O. Christe, William W. Wilson. Perfluoroammonium salt of heptafluoroxenon anion. , June 24, 1982 Xenon fluorides are good fluorinating agents. Clathrates have been used for separation of He and Ne from Ar, Kr, and Xe, and also for the transportation of Ar, Kr, and Xe. (For instance, radioactive isotopes of krypton and xenon are difficult to store and dispose, and compounds of these elements may be more easily handled than the gaseous forms.) In addition, clathrates of radioisotopes may provide suitable formulations for experiments requiring sources of particular types of radiation; hence. 85Kr clathrate provides a safe source of beta particles, while 133Xe clathrate provides a useful source of gamma rays. Oganesson has no applications.

He and Antonio Carlos Jobim, were the first two music composers, together with lyricists Vinicius de Moraes and Ronaldo Boscoli, to be recorded by Jo√£o Gilberto on his first LP entitled Chega de Saudade (1959), which was called the first generation of Bossa Nova. His first song to be recorded was \\"Menina\\" (1954), issued as a single by Sylvia Telles in 1955, with \\"Foi a noite\\" by Antonio Carlos Jobim on the other side of the record. The writers first met because of this single, when Jobim called Lyra \\"the other side of the record\\". At that time, both were writing their own music and lyrics creating a colloquial and completely new style. They wrote about their own experiences and feelings. A completely different lyrical style from most songs written at that time. His first compositions (music and lyrics), from 1954 to 1956 included: \\"Quando chegares\\"; \\"Menina\\"; \\"Barquinho de Papel\\"; \\"Ci√∫me\\"; \\"Criticando\\" and \\"Maria Ningu√©m\\". In 1957 he started to compose together with the lyricist Ronaldo B√¥scoli, songs such as \\"Lobo bobo\\", \\"Saudade fez um samba\\" and\\" Se √© tarde me perdoa\\". In 1958 wrote \\"Aruanda\\" and \\"Quem quiser encontrar o amor\\", with Geraldo Vandr√©. In 1960 he started to compose together with Vinicius de Moraes, songs such as \\"Voc√™ e eu\\"; \\"Coisa mais linda\\", Sabe voc√™?\\", \\"Samba do Carioca\\"; \\"Maria Moita\\" and many others. They wrote together a musical play, in 1962, called \\"Pobre Menina Rica\\" (Poor little rich girl blue). In 1961 he was one of the five founders of CPC (Center of Popular Culture) where he started to write songs for cinema and theater. He also wrote the song \\"Influ√™ncia do Jazz\\", one of the songs he sang at the Bossa Nova Concert at Carnegie Hall, in 1962. He continues to compose, record, and perform.

William F. Albright dated his reign to 732-721 BC, while E. R. Thiele offered the dates 732-723 BC.Edwin Thiele, The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings, (1st ed.; New York: Macmillan, 1951; 2d ed.; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1965; 3rd ed.; Grand Rapids: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983). , 9780825438257, 134, 217. Accession to the throne Assyrian records confirm the Biblical account of how he became king. Under Ahaz, Judah had rendered allegiance to Tiglath-Pileser III of Assyria, when the Northern Kingdom under Pekah, in league with Rezin of Damascus, had attempted to coerce the Judean king into joint action against Assyria. Hoshea, a captain in Pekah's own army, placed himself at the head of the Assyrian party in Samaria; he then removed Pekah by assassination; Tiglath-pileser rewarded Hoshea by making him king over Ephraim (a name used here for the entire northern kingdom), which had been reduced to smaller dimensions.\\"Hoshea\\", Jewish Encyclopedia An undated inscription of Tiglath- Pileser III boasts of making Hoshea king after his predecessor had been overthrown: > Israel (lit. : \\"Omri-house\\" Bit-Humria)...overthrew their king Pekah (Pa-qa- > ha) and I placed Hoshea (A-√∫ -si') as king over them. I received from them > 10 talents of gold, 1,000(?) talents of silver as their [tri]bute and > brought them to Assyria.James B. Pritchard, ed., Ancient Near Eastern Texts > Relating to the Old Testament (3rd ed.; Princeton NJ: Princeton University > Press, 1969) 284. The amount of tribute exacted from Hoshea is not stated in Scripture, but Menahem, about ten years previously (743 or 742 BC)T. C. Mitchell, \\"Israel and Judah until the Revolt of Jehu (931‚Äì841 BC)\\" in Cambridge Ancient History 3, Part 1, ed. John Boardman et al. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991) 326. was required to pay 1,000 talents of silver to Tiglath-Pileser in order to \\"strengthen his hold on the kingdom\\" (), apparently against Menahem's rival Pekah. So long as Tiglath-pileser was on the throne Hoshea remained loyal; but when Shalmaneser V succeeded, Hoshea made an effort to regain his independence and entered into negotiations with Egypt. Probably misled by favorable promises on the part of Egypt, Hoshea discontinued paying tribute. Winckler contends that in this anti-Assyrian movement, in which Tyre also had a share, a last effort was made on the part of the Arabic commercial states to shut out Assyria from the Arabo-Indian commerce, for which possession of the Mediterranean ports was of vital importance. Shalmaneser soon interpreted this as rebellious, and directed his armies against Samaria. The Assyrian Eponym Canon shows that Shalmaneser campaigned \\"against\\" (somewhere, name missing) in the years 727, 726, and 725 BC, and it is presumed that the missing name was Samaria.Thiele, Mysterious Numbers 165. The Babylonian Chronicle states that Shalmaneser ravaged the city of Sha-ma-ra-in (Samaria). Additional evidence that it was Shalmaneser, not Sargon II who initially captured Samaria, despite the latter's claim, late in his reign, that he was its conqueror, was presented by Tadmor, who showed that Sargon had no campaigns in the west in his first two years of reign (722 and 721 BC).Hayim Tadmor, \\"The Campaigns of Sargon II of Assur: A Chronological-Historical Study,\\" Journal of Cuneiform Studies 12 (1958) 39, cited in Thiele, Mysterious Numbers 165, n. 4. End of reign It is likely that Hoshea, disappointed by the lack of Egyptian support, endeavored to avert the calamity by resuming the payment of tribute, but that, distrusted, he was forced to fight, and was taken prisoner in battle. The capital, though deprived of the ruler, made an effective defense. Nonetheless, the Assyrians captured Samaria after a siege of three years. However, Shalmaneser died shortly after the city fell, and the Assyrian army was recalled to secure the succession of Sargon II. The land of Israel, which had resisted the Assyrians for years without a king, again revolted. Sargon returned with the Assyrian army in 720 BC, and pacified the province, deporting the citizens of Israel beyond the Euphrates (some 27,290 according to the inscription of Sargon II), and settling people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath and Sepharvaim in their place (2 Kings 17:6, 24). The author of the Books of Kings states this destruction occurred \\"because the children of Israel sinned against the Lord\\" (). What happened to Hoshea following the end of the kingdom of Israel, and when or where he died, is unknown. King So of Egypt Hoshea eventually withheld the tribute he promised Shalmaneser, expecting the support of \\"So, the king of Egypt\\". There is some mystery as to the identity of this king of Egypt: some scholars have argued that So refers to the Egyptian city Sais (as the New English Bible suggests), and thereby refers to king Tefnakht of the 24th Dynasty. However, the principal city of Egypt at this time was Tanis, which suggests that there was an unnecessary correction of the text, and Kenneth Kitchen is correct in identifying \\"So\\" with Osorkon IV of the 22nd Dynasty. Considering the fact that Osorkon (730-715 BC) reigned at the time of Hoshea, this is highly likely. Alternatively it may refer to a lesser Egyptian, such as Siebe, a commander mentioned in the Assyrian record. Chronological note The calendars for reckoning the years of kings in Judah and Israel were offset by six months, that of Judah starting in Tishri (in the fall) and that of Israel in Nisan (in the spring). Cross-synchronizations between the two kingdoms therefore often allow narrowing of the beginning and/or ending dates of a king to within a six-month range. In the case of Hoshea, synchronization with the reign of Hezekiah of Judah shows that he came to the throne some time between Tishri 1 of 732 BC and the day before the first of Nisan, 731 BC. The end of his reign occurred between the first of Nisan, 723 BC, and the day before Tishri 1 of the same year. This narrowing of the dates for Hoshea is supplied by later scholars who built on Thiele's work, because Thiele did not accept the Hoshea/Hezekiah synchronisms of 2 Kings 18. That Hoshea died before Tishri 1 in the fall of 723 BC is additional evidence that it was Shalmaneser V, not Sargon II, who initially captured Samaria. Shalmaneser did not die until December 722 or January 721 BC.

The -long beltway consists of two segments, the West Beltway (formerly signed as simply I-295), and the East Beltway (formerly signed as State Road 9A), with I-95 serving as the dividing line between the two. The entire highway carries a hidden designation as State Road 9A by the Florida Department of Transportation. The West Beltway was constructed in the 1970s, with the East Beltway being built from the 1980s-2000s. Route description Exit signs at the interchange with Interstate 95, on south I-295. In this picture from 2008, the East Beltway was signed as SR 9A. Beginning at the I-95 interchange in southeastern Duval as the West Beltway, the beltway travels west, passes through the Mandarin area with interchanges at Old St. Augustine Road, and SR 13 (San Jose Boulevard). It then travels along the three mile long Buckman Bridge crossing the St. Johns River immediately south of Naval Air Station Jacksonville, and serves as a major connection in the southern part of Jacksonville. At the western end of the river, I-295 continues west, serving as the border between Clay County and Duval County running just north of the town of Orange Park with interchanges at US 17/SR 15 (Roosevelt Boulevard) and SR 21 (Blanding Boulevard), serving Naval Air Station Jacksonville and Clay county. Before turning north through the Westside of Duval county, the freeway also has a full interchange at east- west connector Collins Road to serve the Argyle and Oak Leaf areas in addition to NASJAX. Continuing north, with full interchanges at SR 134 (103rd Street), SR 208 (Wilson Boulevard), and SR 228 (Normandy Boulevard), Interstate 295, the west half of Jacksonville's Beltway reaches its interchange with Interstate 10 approximately six miles west of Downtown, then crosses over Beaver Street (US 90), a railroad, creek, then continues into Northern Duval. North of the I-10 interchange, the western beltway loops around the northwest side of Jacksonville with full interchanges located at both Commonwealth Avenue and Pritchard Road, before curving northeast to an interchange at US 1/US 23 (New Kings Road). The road then crosses the Trout River before crossing SR 104 (Dunn Avenue), where this northern portion of the loop turns east, with interchanges at SR 115 (Lem Turner Road), SR 243 (International Airport Boulevard)/Duval Road, and I-95, all just south of the Jacksonville International Airport, where the East Beltway begins. I-295 at the Buckman Bridge East of the I-95 interchange near the airport, I-295 continues east as the East Beltway, with the next interchange being US 17 (North Main Street). I-295 starts to curve to the southeast, with interchanges at Pulaski Road, and Alta Drive/Yellowbluff Road. Before orienting itself southward at the SR 105 (Zoo Parkway/Heckscher Drive) area, the freeway crosses the Dames Point Bridge over the St. Johns River into the Fort Caroline area. Just south of the bridge, a partial interchange with SR 113 (Southside Connector) in the Regency area is followed by full interchanges with Merrill Road and Monument Road, providing access through Arlington between Jacksonville University and NS Mayport. Continuing south, it has full interchanges with SR 10 (Atlantic Boulevard), St. Johns Bluff Road, US 90/SR 212 (Beach Boulevard) and Town Center Parkway/University of North Florida Drive access to University of North Florida. The next interchange, (SR 202) J. Turner Butler Boulevard is a freeway to freeway interchange, finished in 2008. After interchanges with Gate Parkway and SR 152 (Baymeadows Road) and a partial interchange with SR 9B (future Interstate 795), I-295 curves to the west, it crosses US 1 (Philips Highway) before completing the loop at I-95 in south Jacksonville. The northern part of the I-295 loop, from Commonwealth Avenue just north of I-10 in the west to J. Turner Butler Boulevard (SR-202) in the east consists of two general purpose lanes in each direction (with the exception of the Dames Point bridge which contains three lanes in each direction). The southern part of the loop consists of three general purpose lanes (except for the Buckman bridge which contains four lanes in each direction), plus two toll express lanes in each direction between I-95 and the Buckman bridge, and, as of 2019, two toll express lanes and one additional general purpose lane under construction between I-795/SR 9B and J. Turner Butler Boulevard. The Blanding Boulevard/Collins Road interchange complex also includes a collector- distributor system. History The current version of I-295 appeared on maps in 1967, as a loop around central Jacksonville, with the first section between I-95 in south Duval County to SR 134 (exit 16) in 1970, and the section from SR 134 to I-10 opened in 1973. The section from I-10 to Commonwealth Ave. (exit 22) opened in 1975, followed by the extension to I-95 in north Jacksonville in 1977, completing the western section of the loop. I-295 northbound at the Dames Point Bridge The eastern section, formerly signed as SR 9A, had its first section open from I-95 in north Jacksonville to US 17 (exit 36) in 1983. The eastern half of the loop was constructed initially as a Super 2 highway with traffic lights in the late 1980s, and was not up to interstate standards. The Dames Point Bridge was signed as I-295 in 1990, but this designation was removed in 1993 and replaced by SR 9A. The final sections of SR 9A were completed in 2006, creating a complete loop around central Jacksonville. Several sections not under interstate compliance were upgraded, and the route was considered interstate ready in 2009. The I-295 East Beltway (formerly signed as SR 9A) was designated the Ronald Reagan Memorial Highway in a Florida Department of Transportation ceremony on August 27, 2009. After the Federal Highway Administration accepted the road as the eastern loop of Interstate 295 in 2010, the state was no longer able to name the highway.Hannan, Larry: \\"Jacksonville's 9A now Ronald Reagan Memorial Highway\\" Florida Times-Union, August 26, 2009. Improvements to the I-95 interchange north close by the airport were under construction, new lanes and a flyover ramp were constructed to help improve the interchange. This was completed in late September 2010. On December 4, 2011, the two halves of the Jacksonville beltway changed over to their current designations, the West Beltway (formerly the whole of I-295), and the East Beltway (formerly State Road 9A). The East Beltway was officially given the I-295 designation, making the entire beltway I-295, with State Road 9A remaining the hidden designation for the entire beltway for FDOT purposes.\\"I-295, SR 9A Getting $1.3 Million Name Change\\" First Coast News, December 2nd, 2011. In February 2011, construction began for a new interchange at Collins Road, just west of the congested Blanding Boulevard exit. The $63.4 million project was completed in December 2013, earlier than the originally projected 2014 date. On May 18, 2019, two express toll lanes in each direction stretching from the Buckman Bridge near Exit 5 at San Jose Boulevard (SR 13) to I-95 (Exit 61) at the southern end of Jacksonville opened after several years of construction.  Interstate 795 (SR 9B)  SR 9B in southeastern Jacksonville Extending from the southeast corner of the loop is Interstate 795, currently signed as SR 9B, an approximately expressway connecting to I-95 and proceeding southwards into St. John‚Äôs county. In May 2008, the SR 9B project was originally suspended by the Florida Department of Transportation. The project was reinstated in 2009, and construction of Phase 1 began in June 2010 and opened on September 19, 2013. Construction of Phase 2, which extends SR 9B from US 1 to I-95, started in May 2013 and opened on June 13, 2016. Construction of Phase 3 extending south of I-95 to County Road 2209 and Race Track Road via a connector road in St. Johns County began on September 8, 2015 and completed on August 8, 2018. I-795 signage along the route has yet to occur. 1992 attacks In 1992, a series of sniper shootings and concrete block- and brick-throwing attacks occurred on the West Beltway. Of the 36 confirmed attacks, \\"5 [were] shootings from moving vehicles, 15 shootings from overpasses or the side of the road, 15 cases in which concrete, bricks or rocks were thrown at vehicles and 1 instance in which shooting and concrete-throwing were combined.\\" At least one motorist, William Klinedinst, died after a concrete block landed on the hood of his moving car, causing it to crash; his body was not identified for several weeks. Another motorist, Debra Lewis, received a bullet wound to the face, and several other injuries occurred. The incidents spurred then-governor Lawton Chiles to dispatch the Florida National Guard to patrol the roadway and the American Automobile Association (AAA) to issue a rare travel warning for the interstate and direct its customers to avoid its use. A task force was set up by the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office (JSO) to investigate the incidents and, though charges were filed, they were eventually dropped. The task force was disbanded at the end of 1992 and the incidents remained unsolved to this day. Future tolled express lanes are being constructed from Exit 58 at I-795/SR 9B to Exit 53 at J. Turner Butler Boulevard (JTB; SR-202). Originally this work was expected to be completed in late 2019, however, in mid-2019 the FDOT extended construction by a year in order to increase the scope of the project to provide for an additional non-tolled general purpose lane in each direction between I-795/SR 9B and JTB (for a total of three contiguous general-purpose lanes along the entire section, eliminating the current lane drops at the Baymeadows Road and Gate Parkway interchanges).

The chronicles mention that the Kingdom of Iberia and its capital were conquered by Alexander the Great in the 4th century BC, but certain historians do not accept this. Eventually, the ruler appointed by Alexander ruined the walls of Mtskheta and left only four fortresses, one of them known today as Armazi. Ancient sources of the 4th-3rd centuries BC mention that Mtskheta had a number of neighbourhoods. Among them, Armazis-tsikhe, Tzitzamuri, Jvari and others. Like other Georgian towns it was divided into the city proper and the citadel. Both the excavations and The Georgian chronicles tell about considerable construction in the Hellenistic period: residential houses, palaces and fortifications. New wall around Mtskheta was built by the first Georgian King Parnavaz in the beginning of the 3rd century BC, and later strengthened by his son Saurmag in the late 3rd - beginning of 2nd century BC. In the end of the 2nd century - beginning of the 1st, the King Parnajom strengthened his relations with Persians and invited Zoroastrian priests to settle in Mtskheta. This probably lead to construction of Zoroastrian temples in the city. Meanwhile, no such archeological evidences exist. Again the walls of Mtskheta were improved during the reign of Bartom in the 1st century BC, and later also by Aderki, often identified with Pharasmanes I. The latter king is associated with appearance of first Christian communities in Kartli and arrival of the Holy Tunic to Mtskheta, brought from Jerusalem by local Jews. The city was strongly fortified at that period. Walls were on both sides of Mtkvari River, and three forts were protecting it. The main citadel, Armazi, on Mount Bagineti was controlling the entrance from south and east, Tsitsamuri, at the base of Mount Jvari from the north, and Sarkine from the west. Mtskheta was a site of early Christian activity resulting in Christianization of Iberia, where Christianity was proclaimed the state religion in 337. It remains the headquarters of the Georgian Orthodox Church. Around that period Mtskheta was a culturally developed city. A gravestone dated between the end of 4th and beginning and 5th centuries, found in Samtavro necropolis, contains an epitaph in Greek, telling about the main architect and archizograph (artist) of Mtskheta Aurelius Acholis. In the first years after the conversion of Georgia into Christianity, a small wooden church was built in the center of the city, later to become Svetitskhoveli Cathedral. Archeological excavations revealed the remnants of the wooden church within the cathedral. By the 5th century AD the small church was no longer satisfying the growing community of the city, and Vakhtang Gorgasali built a large basilica, the greatest Assumption church in Georgia, Svetitskhoveli, that survived until 11th century. The first katolikos was elected in the 5th century, and his residence was in Svetotskhoveli, in Mtskheta. Middle Ages King Dachi of Iberia (early 6th century AD), who was the successor of Vakhtang I of Iberia, moved the capital from Mtskheta to the more easily defensible Tbilisi according to the will left by his father. Afterwards the importance of Mtskheta began to decline, while that of Tbilisi grew. However, Mtskheta continued as the coronation and burial place for most kings of Georgia until the end of the kingdom in the 19th century. In the 11th century, the earlier basilica of Svetitskhoveli was too small again, and Katolikos Melchizedek I built a new church on top of it. Modern times The old city lies at the confluence of the rivers Mtkvari and Aragvi. In recognition of its role in the Georgian Christian history, Mtskheta was granted the status of a \\"Holy City\\" by Catholicos-Patriarch Ilia II of Georgia in accordance with the written testament of his 11th-century predecessor Melchizedek I of Georgia. Geography Mtskheta is set on a lowland, surrounded by mountains, at the confluence of the two rivers, Mtkvari and Aragvi. The city is approached from the north by the Greater Caucasus and from the south by the Lesser Caucasus mountains. Monuments Svetitskhoveli seen from an old street Svetitskhoveli Cathedral (11th century), Samtavro Monastery (4th century) and Jvari Monastery (6th century) in Mtskheta are amongst the most significant monuments of Georgian Christian architecture, and are historically significant in the development of medieval architecture throughout the Caucasus. Of special significance are early inscriptions, which form a valuable reference in the study of the origins of the early Georgian alphabet.. Samtavro necropolis, a burial place north of the monastery, is dated between the middle of the 3rd millennium BC and the 10th century. Jvari Monastery Samtavro Monastery In the outskirts of Mtskheta are the ruins of Armaztsikhe fortress (3rd century BC), the Armaztsikhe acropolis (dating to the late 1st century BC), remains of a \\"Pompey's bridge\\" (according to legends built by Roman legionnaires of Pompey the Great in the 1st century BC), the fragmentary remains of a royal palace (1st‚Äì3rd century AD), a nearby tomb of the 1st century AD, and the fortress of Bebris tsikhe (14th century). The Institute of Archaeology, and the garden of Mikheil Mamulashvili are also worthy of note. There is also a monument to sculptor Elena Machabeli. \\"Pompey's bridge\\", August 2008 A mausoleum of rich woman from 1st century AD was recovered near Mtskheta train station.

They may be attended by a midwife, or lay attendant with experience in managing home births. Home birth was, until the advent of modern medicine, the de facto method of delivery. The term was coined in the middle of the 19th century as births began to take place in hospitals. Since the beginning of the 20th century, home birth rates have fallen in most developed countries, generally to less than 1% of all births. Infant and mother mortality rates have also dropped drastically over the same time period. Women with access to high-quality medical care may choose home birth because they prefer the intimacy of a home and family-centered experience, to avoid risks related to in-hospital births, or desire to avoid a medically centered experience typical of a hospital, among other reasons. Professionals attending home births can be obstetricians, certified or uncertified midwives, and doulas. In developing countries, where women may not be able to afford medical care or it may not be accessible to them, a home birth may be the only option available, and the woman may or may not be assisted by a professional attendant of any kind. Multiple studies have been performed concerning the safety of home births for both the child and the mother. Standard practices, licensing requirements and access to emergency hospital care differ between regions making it difficult to compare studies across national borders. A 2014 US survey of medical studies found that perinatal mortality rates were triple that of hospital births, and a US nationwide study over 13 million births on a 3-year span (2007‚Äì2010) found that births at home were roughly 10 times as likely to be stillborn (14 times in first-born babies) and almost four times as likely to have neonatal seizures or serious neurological dysfunction when compared to babies born in hospitals, while a 2007 UK survey found that perinatal mortality rates were only slightly higher in that country than planned hospital births for low-risk pregnancies. Higher maternal and infant mortality rates are associated with the inability to offer timely assistance to mothers with emergency procedures in case of complications during labour, as well as with widely varying licensing and training standards for birth attendants between different states and countries. Etymology The word combination \\"home birth\\" arose some time in the middle of the 19th century and coincided with the rise of births that took place in lying-in hospitals. Since women around the world left homes to give birth in clinics and hospitals as the 20th century progressed, the term \\"home birth\\" came to refer to giving birth, intentionally or otherwise, in a residence as opposed to a hospital. History and philosophy Although the fact humans give birth is universal, the social nature of birth is not. Where, with whom, how, and when someone gives birth is socially and culturally determined. Historically, birth has been a social event. For the most of humankind history of birth is equivalent to history of home birth. The hypothesis exists that birth was transformed from a solitary to social event early in human evolution. Traditionally and historically other women assisted women in childbirth. A special term evolved in the English language around 1300 to name women who made assistance in childbirth their vocation - midwife, literally meaning \\"with woman\\". Yet midwife was a description of a social role of a woman who was \\"with woman\\" in childbirth to mediate social arrangements for woman's bodily experience of birth. Types Home births are either attended or unattended, planned or unplanned. Women are attended when they are assisted through labor and birth by a professional, usually a midwife, and rarely a general practitioner. Women who are unassisted or only attended by a lay person, perhaps a doula, their spouse, family, friend, or a non- professional birth attendant, are sometimes called freebirths. A \\"planned\\" home birth is a birth that occurs at home by intention. An \\"unplanned\\" home birth is one that occurs at home by necessity but not with intention. Reasons for unplanned home births include inability to travel to the hospital or birthing center due to conditions outside the control of the mother such as weather or road blockages or speed of birth progression. Factors Many women choose home birth because delivering a baby in familiar surroundings is important to them. Others choose home birth because they dislike a hospital or birthing center environment, do not like a medically centered birthing experience, are concerned about exposing the infant to hospital-borne pathogens, or dislike the presence of strangers at the birth. Others prefer home birth because they feel it is more natural and less stressful. In a study published in the Journal of Midwifery and Women's Health, women were asked, Why did you choose a home birth? The top five reasons given were safety, avoidance of unnecessary medical interventions common in hospital births, previous negative hospital experiences, more control, and a comfortable and familiar environment. One study found that women experience pain inherent in birth differently, and less negatively, in a home setting. In developing countries, where women may not be able to afford medical care or it may not be accessible to them, a home birth may be the only option available, and the woman may or may not be assisted by a professional attendant of any kind. Some women may not be able to have a safe birth at home, even with highly trained midwives. There are some medical conditions that can prevent a woman from qualifying for a home birth. These often include heart disease, renal disease, diabetes, preeclampsia, placenta previa, placenta abruption, antepartum hemorrhage after 20 weeks gestation, and active genital herpes. Prior cesarean deliveries can sometimes prevent a woman from qualifying for a home birth, though not always. It is important that a woman and her health care provider discuss the individual health risks prior to planning a home birth. Trends Home birth was, until the advent of modern medicine, the de facto method of delivery. In many developed countries, home birth declined rapidly over the 20th century. In the United States there was a large shift towards hospital births beginning around 1900, when close to 100% of births were at home. Rates of home births fell to 50% in 1938 and to fewer than 1% in 1955. However, between 2004 and 2009, the number of home births in the United States rose by 41%. In the United Kingdom a similar but slower trend happened with approximately 80% of births occurring at home in the 1920s and only 1% in 1991. In Japan the change in birth location happened much later, but much faster: home birth was at 95% in 1950, but only 1.2% in 1975. In countries such as the Netherlands, where home births have been a regular part of the maternity system, the rate for home births is 20% in 2014. Over a similar time period, maternal mortality during childbirth fell during 1900 to 1997 from 6‚Äì9 deaths per thousand to 0.077 deaths per thousand, while the infant mortality rate dropped between 1915 and 1997 from around 100 deaths per thousand births to 7.2 deaths per thousand. One doctor described birth in a working-class home in the 1920s: This experience is contrasted with a 1920s hospital birth by Adolf Weber: Midwifery, the practice supporting a natural approach to birth, enjoyed a revival in the United States during the 1970s. Ina May Gaskin, for example, sometimes called \\"the mother of authentic midwifery\\" helped open The Farm Midwifery Center in Summertown, Tennessee, in 1971, which is still in operation. However, although there was a steep increase in midwife-attended births between 1975 and 2002 (from less than 1.0% to 8.1%), most of these births occurred in the hospital. The US rate of out-of-hospital birth has remained steady at 1% of all births since 1989, with data from 2007 showing that 27.3% of the home births since 1989 took place in a free-standing birth center and 65.4% in a residence. Hence, the actual rate of home birth in the United States remained low (0.65%) over the twenty years prior to 2007. Home birth in the United Kingdom has also received some press since 2000. There was a movement, most notably in Wales, to increase home birth rates to 10% by 2007. Between 2005 and 2006, there was an increase of 16% of home birth rates in Wales, but by 2007 the total home birth rate was still 3% even in Wales (double the national rate). A 2001 report noted that there was a wide range of home birth rates in the UK, with some regions around 1% and others over 20%. In Australia, birth at home has fallen steadily over the years and was 0.3% as of 2008, ranging from nearly 1% in the Northern Territory to 0.1% in Queensland. In 2004, the New Zealand rate for births at home was nearly three times Australia's with a rate of 2.5% and increasing. In the Netherlands, the trend has been somewhat different from other industrialized countries: while in 1965, two-thirds of Dutch births took place at home, that figure has dropped to about 20% in 2013, which is still more than in other industrialized countries. Less than 1% of South Korean infants are born at home.  Research on safety  In 2014, a comprehensive review in the Journal of Medical Ethics of 12 previously published studies encompassing 500,000 planned home births in low-risk women found that neonatal mortality rates for home births were triple those of hospital births. This finding echoes that of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Due to a greater risk of perinatal death, the College advises women who are postterm (greater than 42 weeks gestation), carrying twins, or have a breech presentation not to attempt home birth. The Journal of Medical Ethics review additionally found that several studies concluded that home births had a higher risk of failing Apgar scores in newborns, as well as a delay in diagnosing hypoxia, acidosis and asphyxia. This contradicts a 2007 UK review study by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), a British governmental organization devoted to creating guidelines for coverage throughout the UK, which expressed concern for the lack of quality evidence in studies comparing the potential risks and benefits of home and hospital birthing environments in the UK. Their report noted that intrapartum-related perinatal mortality was low in all settings in the UK, but that in cases of unanticipated obstetric complications, the mortality rate was higher for home births due to the time needed to transfer the mother to an obstetric unit. A 2002 study of planned home births in the state of Washington found that home births had shorter labors than hospital births. In North America, a 2005 study found that about 12 percent of women intending to give birth at home needed to be transferred to the hospital for reasons such as a difficult labor or pain relief. A 2014 survey of American home births between 2004 and 2010 found the percent of women transferred to a hospital from a planned home birth after beginning labor to be 10.9%. Both the Journal of Medical Ethics and NICE report noted that usage of caesarean sections were lower for women who give birth at home, and both noted a prior study that determined that women who had a planned home birth had greater satisfaction from the experience when compared with women who had a planned birth in a hospital. In 2009 a study of 500,000 low-risk planned home and hospital births in the UK, where midwives have a strong licensing requirement, was reported in the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. The study concluded that for low-risk women there was no increase in perinatal mortality, provided that the midwives were well-trained and there was easy and quick access to hospitals. Further, the study noted there was evidence that \\"low risk women with a planned home birth are less likely to experience referral to secondary care and subsequent obstetric interventions than those with a planned hospital birth.\\" The study has been criticised on several grounds, including that some data might be missing and that the findings may not be representative of other populations. In 2012, Oregon performed a study of all births in the state during the year as a part of discussing a bill regarding licensing requirements for midwives in the state. They found that the rate of intrapartum infant mortality was 0.6 deaths per thousand births for planned hospital births, and 4.8 deaths per thousand for planned home births. They further found that the death rate for planned home births attended by direct-entry midwives was 5.6 per thousand. The study noted that the statistics for Oregon were different for other areas, such as British Columbia, which had different licensing requirements. Oregon was noted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as having the second-highest rate of home births in the nation in 2009, at 1.96% compared to the national average of 0.72%. A 2014 survey of nearly 17,000 voluntarily reported home births in the United States between 2004 and 2010 found an intrapartum infant mortality rate of 1.30 per thousand; early neonatal and late neonatal mortality rates were a further 0.41 and 0.35 per thousand. The survey excluded congenital anomaly-related deaths, as well as births where the mother was transferred to a hospital prior to beginning labor. In October 2013 the largest study of this kind was published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology and included data on more than 13 million births in the United States, assessing deliveries by physicians and midwives in and out of the hospital from 2007 to 2010. The study indicated that babies born at home are roughly 10 times as likely to have an Apgar score of 0 after 5 minutes and almost four times as likely to have neonatal seizures or serious neurological dysfunction when compared to babies born in hospitals. The study findings showed that the risk of Apgar scores of 0 is even greater in first-born babies‚Äî14 times the risk of hospital births. The study results were confirmed by analyzing birth certificate files from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Center for Health Statistics. Given the study's findings, Dr. Amos Grunebaum, professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at Weill Cornell Medical College and lead author of the study, stated that the magnitude of risk associated with home delivery is so alarming that necessitates the need for the parents-to-be to know the risk factors. Another author, Dr. Frank Chervenak, added that the study underplayed the risks of home births, as the data used counted home births where the mother was transferred to a hospital during labor as a hospital birth. Study design Randomized controlled trials are the \\"gold standard\\" of research methodology with respect to applying findings to populations; however, such a study design is not feasible or ethical for location of birth. The studies that do exist, therefore, are cohort studies conducted retrospectively by selecting hospital records and midwife records. by matched pairs (by pairing study participants based on their background characteristics), In February 2011 the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists identified several factors that make quality research on home birth difficult. These include \\"lack of randomization; reliance on birth certificate data with inherent ascertainment problems; ascertainment of relying on voluntary submission of data or self-reporting; a limited ability to distinguish between planned and unplanned birth; variation in the skill, training, and certification of the birth attendant; and an inability to account for and accurately attribute adverse outcomes associated with transfers\\". Quality studies, therefore, need to take steps in their design to mitigate these problems in order to produce meaningful results. The data available on the safety of home birth in developed countries is often difficult to interpret due to issues such as differing home-birth standards between different countries, and difficult to compare with other studies because of varying definitions of perinatal mortality. Additionally, it is difficult to compare home and hospital births because only the risk profiles are different between the two groups, according to the CDC: people who choose to give birth at home are more likely to be healthy and at low risk for complications. There are also unquantifiable differences in home birth patients, such as maternal attitudes towards medical involvement in birth.  Methods of scientific inquiry  Modern scientific inquiry into home birth takes place in the fields of anthropology, epistemology, ethnology, history, jurisprudence, medicine, midwifery, public health, sociology, and women's studies. Research of home birth is complicated by ancient and modern biases about the nature of women and birth that are manifested in our language and ideas that we transmit about women, women's bodies, and what women do. It has been demonstrated that reports of research of physiological phenomena, such as conception, transmit deep-seated biased cultural notions of women and women's bodies. Most last century and 21st century researchers of home birth view the phenomenon through two broad perspectives that are closely tied to the ideas and perceptions of birth itself - social and biomedical. Insurance and Licensing Issues While a woman in developed countries may choose to deliver her child at home, in a birthing center, or at hospital, health coverage and legal issues influence available options. Australia In April 2007, the Western Australian Government expanded coverage for birth at home across the State. Other state governments in Australia, including the Northern Territory, New South Wales and South Australia, also provide government funding for independent, private home birth. The 2009 Federal Budget provided additional funds to Medicare to allow more midwives to work as private practitioners, allow midwives to prescribe medication under the Medicare Benefits Schedule, and assist them with medical indemnity insurance. However, this plan only covers hospital births. There are no current plans to extend Medicare and PBS funding to home birth services in Australia. As of July 2012, all health professionals must show proof of liability insurance. In March 2016 the Coroners Court of Victoria found against midwife Gaye Demanuel in the case of the death of Caroline Lovell. . \\"Coroner White also called for a review of the regulation of midwives caring for women during home births, and for the government and health authorities to consider an offence banning unregistered health practitioners from taking money for attending home births.\\" Canada Public health coverage of home birth services varies from province to province as does the availability of doctors and midwives providing home birth services. The Provinces of Ontario, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Alberta, and Quebec currently cover home birth services. United Kingdom There are few legal issues with a home birth in the UK. Woman can not be forced to go to a hospital. The support of the various Health Authorities of the National Health Service may vary, but in general the NHS will cover home births - the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health, Lord Hunt of King's Heath has stated \\"I turn to the issue of home births. The noble Lord, Lord Mancroft, made some helpful remarks. As I understand it, although the NHS has a legal duty to provide a maternity service, there is not a similar legal duty to provide a home birth service to every woman who requests one. However, I certainly hope that when a woman wants a home birth, and it is clinically appropriate, the NHS will do all it can to support that woman in her choice of a home birth.\\" United States Practicing as a direct-entry midwife was illegal in states shown here in red in 2006 27 states license or regulate in some manner direct-entry midwives, or certified professional midwife (CPM). In the other 23 states there are no licensing laws, and practicing midwives can be arrested for practicing medicine without a license. It is legal in all 50 states to hire a certified nurse midwife, or CNM, who are trained nurses, though most CNMs work in hospitals.

It was launched in July 1982, with a US sales price of US$99.95, making it the cheapest home computer at the time; it was advertised as \\"the first computer under $100\\". The computer was aimed at regular home users. Unlike earlier computers aimed at home users, the TS1000 was not a kit which had to be soldered and assembled. As purchased, the TS1000 was fully assembled and ready to be plugged into the users' home TV (which served as a video monitor). The TS1000 was a slightly modified version of the Sinclair ZX81 with an NTSC RF modulator, designed for use with North American TVs, instead of the UK PAL RF modulator which was used for units sold in Portugal. The TS1000 doubled the onboard RAM from 1 KB to 2 KB. The TS1000's casing had slightly more internal shielding but remained the same as Sinclair's, including the membrane keyboard. It had black-and-white graphics and no sound. It was followed by an improved version, the Timex Sinclair 1500 which had substantially more RAM (16 KB) and a lower price (US$80). However, the TS1500 did not achieve market success, given that the marketplace was by this time dominated by Commodore, RadioShack, Atari and Apple. History Revision of the Timex Sinclair 1000 motherboard with \\"Sinclair ZX81\\" printed on the PCB Timex claimed to have sold 600,000 TS1000s in the US by early 1983, and other companies imported localized versions of British software. It sold for US$99.95 in the US when it debuted, making it the cheapest home computer at the time; it was advertised as \\"the first computer under $100\\". This pricing initiated a price war with Commodore International, who quickly reduced the price of its VIC-20 to match and later announced a trade-in program offering $100 for any competing computer toward the purchase of a Commodore 64. Since the TS1000 was selling for $49 by this time, many customers bought them for the sole purpose of trading them in for a Commodore 64. Like the Sinclair ZX81, the TS1000 used a form of BASIC as its primary interface and programming language. To make the membrane keyboard less cumbersome for program entry, the TS1000 used a shortcut system of one-letter \\"keywords\\" for most commands (e.g., pressing \\"P\\" while the cursor was in \\"keyword mode\\" would generate the keyword \\"PRINT\\"). Some keywords required a short sequence of keystrokes (e.g., SHIFT-ENTER S would generate the keyword \\"LPRINT\\"). One notable thing about this version of BASIC was that, unlike other versions where it's optional in a program, the LET command was used extensively for data. The TS1000 was normally plugged into a regular TV that served as a computer monitor. The computer produced a black-and-white display that consisted of 32 columns and 24 lines. Of those lines, 22 were accessible for display, with two reserved for data entry and error messages. The limited graphics were based on geometric shapes contained within the operating system's non-ASCII character set. The only form of long- term storage was Compact Cassette. The 16 KB memory expansion module sold for $49.95. A shortage of the memory expansion modules coupled with a lack of software that would run within 2 KB meant that the system had little use for anything other than as an introduction to programming. Home computer magazines of the era such as Compute! showed enthusiasts how to interface the computer with various kinds of equipment. These tutorials provided an opportunity for learning about early speech synthesis technology through a Speak & Spell, robotics control through the memory port, and scrolling text displays for advertising. Over time, the TS1000 spawned a cottage industry of third-party add-ons designed to help remedy its limitations and provide more functions. Full-size keyboards, speech synthesizers, sound generators, disk drives, and memory expansions (up to 64 KB) were a few of the options available. Languages such as Forth and Pascal, as well as BASIC compilers and assemblers, augmented the TS1000's programming possibilities. Computer enthusiast magazines from the early 1980s included articles that contained the programming instructions for simple games and other programs that could be used with the device. Microcomputing magazine published an article in April 1983, criticizing the membrane keyboard (\\"The designers of the Timex-Sinclair 1000 ... reduced this important programming tool to a fraction of the required size\\") and describing how to connect external full-size keyboards. Timex Sinclair 1500  Timex Sinclair 1500 The TS1500 was an upgraded TS1000 with a better keyboard and 16 KB RAM. Timex Sinclair (TMX Portugal) designed the TS1500 and offered it to the Timex Corporation. The design utilized the TS2000 (ZX Spectrum) silver cases that weren't previously used because of the launch of the TS2068. The TS1500 replaced the earlier machine's ZX81-like case with a silver ZX Spectrum-like case, the same ZX Spectrum rubber keyboard, and a custom ULA. The TS1500 did not incorporate the Ferranti ULA. The TS1500 used a standard television for its display, \\"broadcasting\\" on either channel 2 or 3. It defaulted to TV channel 2, but if the \\"3\\" was pressed on the keyboard within a few seconds of turning the computer on, it changed to channel 3 instead. Although the TS1500 came with 16 KB internal RAM, an external 16 KB RAM pack could be added for a total of 32 KB RAM. A few keyboard commands (POKEs) were required for the system to recognize the additional memory space (the RAM pack is multiplexed to the start of the RAM). The TS1500 sold for $80 and was not a commercial success because of its late launch long after the success of the TS1000 and TS2068. The ZX81/TS1000's successors, the ZX Spectrum/TS2068, were already available, and the home computer market in general was dominated by Commodore, RadioShack, Atari and Apple. It was sold in the United States, Canada and Portugal. Bugs There are two little-known software differences between the TS1000 and TS1500. On the TS1000 and ZX81, the command: LPRINT 0.00001 results in the Timex printer outputting 0.0XYZ1. This well-known fault was corrected on the TS1500. The TS1000 runs the following loop correctly, but the TS1500 does not; it makes one fewer iteration than it should. 10 FOR I=0 TO 1 STEP 0.25 20 PRINT I 30 NEXT I Peripherals Timex Computer Corporation produced a cartridge interface for the TS1000, the Timex Sinclair 1510 Command Cartridge Player.

The TS1510 can be used with a TS1000 and a 16 KB RAM pack (an additional RAM pack). Users could also load programs using a tape recorder and compact cassettes. Timex released a thermal printer for use with the TS1000. The printer retailed for $100.00.

Although she had been writing since childhood, much of her work was published posthumously. Among those are her best known works, the novels Home Influence and A Mother's Recompense. Aguilar was the eldest child of Sephardic Jewish refugees from Portugal who settled in the London Borough of Hackney. An early illness resulted in her being educated by her parents, especially her mother, who taught her the tenets of Judaism. Later, her father taught the history of Spanish and Portuguese Jews during his own bout with tuberculosis which had led the family to move to the English coast. After surviving the measles at the age of 19, she began to embark on a serious writing career, even though her physical health never completely recovered. Aguilar's debut was an anonymous collection of poems, The Magic Wreath of Hidden Flowers. Three years later she translated Isaac Orobio de Castro's Israel Defended into English at her father's behest. Later her The Spirit of Judaism drew interest and sales in both Britain and the United States after being published in Philadelphia by Isaac Leeser. He added a preface to the work elucidating his differences with her, the first of many clashes her work would have with mainstream Jewish thought. In the 1840s her novels began to attract regular readers, and Aguilar moved back to London with her parents. Despite her success, she and her mother still had to operate a boys' Hebrew school to stay solvent, which she resented for the time and energy it took from her writing. In 1847, she became ill again with a spinal paralysis which she did not let prevent her from visiting her brother in Frankfurt. Her health worsened and she died there that September.  Biography = Childhood  Grace Aguilar was born in the northeast London suburb of Hackney, London, on 2 June 1816. She was the oldest child of her parents descended from Portuguese Marranos who had sought asylum in England in the 18th century following the Portuguese Inquisition. Emanuel, her father, was the lay leader of London's Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue, and her mother Sarah was active in the city's Jewish community as well. Her religious background and illnesses, both hers and her parents', were major factors in her life and influential on her work.Galchinsky, 17.,  Illness and education  For her first eight years, Aguilar was an only child. During this time, Aguilar suffered from a chronic long-term illness that led her parents to educate her at home. She was tutored in the classics at home and (even in adulthood) was not permitted to move outside of her family circle. Her mother, in keeping with post-Inquisition practice among Sephardic Jews from the Iberian Peninsula, educated the young Aguilar in her religion and its tenets. Her condition did not stop her from learning to dance and play the harp and piano, common pursuits for middle-class English girls of that era, or traveling‚Äîwhen her brother Emanuel was born in 1823, the family went on an extended tour of Gloucestershire.Galchinsky, 18. When Aguilar's father contracted tuberculosis, the family moved to Devon. While Grace was taking care of him, her father taught her the oral history of the Jews of Spain and Portugal, complementing her mother's earlier instruction in Judaism. He may also have taught her Hebrew, which was extremely unusual for a Jewish woman to know at that time. Both her religious and literary interests date to that time of her life; she began indulging them both by making her first efforts at poetry and fiction and attending some Protestant services. A collection of conch shells she found on a Teignmouth beach spurred her to attempt a scientific paper on the subject. Sarah Aguilar's health took a turn for the worse during this period, as she recovered from surgical treatment for an illness that has not yet been identified from the records available, and Grace spent time taking care of her as she had her father.Galchinsky, 20. In 1835, at the age of 19, Grace was again taken ill herself, with measles. She never completely recovered.  Writing career  The family moved to Brighton afterwards, perhaps to be closer to London's Jewish community. The two Aguilar boys had been sent to boarding school, but with her parents' health declining, Grace began to think about her responsibilities to not only them but her brothers as well. She decided to try making a living as a writer, and that year was able to get her first book of poems published. Her first book was successful enough that a second run was printed in 1839, and she began writing in earnest. Much of this work was published posthumously, with one exception. In 1838 Aguilar's father prevailed upon her to translate Isaac Orobio de Castro's Israel Defended, an apologia for Judaism, from the original French for private distribution among Brighton's Jewish community. She added a preface that, albeit with some ambivalence, explained that she had softened Orobio's castigations of Christians as a result of the tolerance she felt Victorian England had shown to its Jewish population compared with Catholic Spain and Portugal. Two years later the family returned to London.Galchinsky, 21. There, Aguilar befriended the young Benjamin Disraeli, whose father Isaac was a well-known author. The older man was able to help her find a publisher. He declined, but on her own she was able to persuade Isaac Leeser, editor of The Occident, an American Jewish magazine, to publish her theological tract The Spirit of Judaism as the initial volume of a new series of books he was bringing out. The original manuscript was lost at sea, but Aguilar was able to recreate it from her notes, and it was published in 1842. When she received her copy, Aguilar was angry that Leeser had added a preface detailing his differences of opinion with Aguilar.Galchinsky, 22. The book was nevertheless well-received, and Aguilar began publishing poems in small English journals. Isaac D'Israeli now chose to help her, possibly introducing her to Edward Moxon, his own publisher. Moxon in turn introduced her to R. Groombridge & Sons, the large publisher that would eventually bring out most of her work in Britain.Galchinsky, 23. Despite her anger over the preface he added to The Spirit of Judaism, Aguilar continued to publish her poetry in Leeser's journals. She befriended Solomon Cohen, the first Jewish state senator in Georgia and his wife Miriam, which contributed to the success of her work in the South as they distributed her books widely there. In England, her domestic fiction drew readers and acclaim. However, she still needed to run a boys' Hebrew school with her mother to make enough money to live on, an obligation she complained about bitterly and repeatedly in her letters to Miriam Cohen, since she felt it took away from the time she had to write. She also anguished over the fate of her brother Henry, who had chosen a career as a sailor.Galchinsky, 24. The last three years of her life were busy. Aguilar turned to nonfiction, producing Women of Israel, an account of the lives of Jewish women that was recognized as her masterpiece. In 1845, the family was able to move again, to a house on Hackney's Clapton Square, where she tended to her father until his death the following year.Galchinsky, 27.  Last years and death  In 1847 Aguilar came down with a spinal paralysis; in spite of the illness she went ahead with a planned trip to Europe. Before her departure some Jewish women of London presented her with a gift and an address recounting her achievements in behalf of Judaism and Jewish women. She later visited Emanuel at Frankfurt, where he had become a successful musician. At first she seemed to benefit by the change of scene and climate, but after a few weeks she went to the baths of Schwalbach for treatment. More symptoms led her return to Frankfurt, where she died on 16 September 1847. Aguilar was buried at the Frankfurt Jewish cemetery in Hessen, Germany. The epitaph of her tombstone was taken from Proverbs 31, the section of the biblical work on the \\"woman of valor\\":\\"Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her at the gate\\".Galchinsky, 28. Literary works Aguilar's literary career began with the diary she started at seven and continued, uninterrupted, until her death. Before she was twelve she had written a drama, Gustavus Vasa, which has since been lost. Her first verses were evoked two years later by the scenery about Tavistock in Devonshire. Her early collected poems, under the title The Magic Wreath of Hidden Flowers, were published anonymously in 1835; each is a riddle with clues to the name of a particular flower. Aguilar's productions are chiefly stories and religious works dealing with Jewish subjects. The former embrace domestic tales, tales founded on Marano history, and a romance of Scottish history, The Days of Bruce (1852). The most popular of the Jewish tales is The Vale of Cedars, or the Martyr: A Story of Spain in the Fifteenth Century, written before 1835, published in 1850, and twice translated into German and twice into Hebrew. Her other stories founded on Jewish episodes are included in a collection of nineteen tales, Home Scenes and Heart Studies (published posthumously 1852); The Perez Family (1843) and The Edict together with The Escape, had appeared as two separate volumes; the others were reprinted from magazines. Her domestic tales are Home Influence (1847) and its sequel, The Mother's Recompense (1850), both of them written early in 1836, Woman's Friendship (1851), and Helon: A Fragment from Jewish History (1852). The first of Aguilar's religious works was a translation of the French version of Israel Defended, by the Marrano Orobio de Castro, printed for private circulation. It was closely followed by \\"The Spirit of Judaism,\\" the publication of which was for a time prevented by the loss of the original manuscript. Sermons by Rabbi Isaac Leeser, of Philadelphia, had fallen into her hands and, like all other accessible Jewish works, had been eagerly read. She requested him to revise the manuscript of the Spirit of Judaism, which was forwarded to him, but was lost. The author rewrote it; and in 1842 it was published in Philadelphia, with notes by Leeser. A second edition was issued in 1849 by the first American Jewish Publication Society; and a third (Cincinnati, 1864) has an appendix containing thirty-two poems (bearing date 1838-1847), all but two reprinted from \\"The Occident\\". The editor's notes serve mainly to mark dissent from Aguilar's depreciation of Jewish tradition ‚Äî due probably to her Marrano ancestry and to her country life, cut off from association with Jews. In 1845 The Women of Israel appeared‚Äîa series of portraits delineated according to the Scriptures and Josephus. This was soon followed by \\"The Jewish Faith: Its Spiritual Consolation, Moral Guidance, and Immortal Hope,\\" in thirty-one letters, the last dated September, 1846. Of this work‚Äîaddressed to a Jewess under the spell of Christian influence, to demonstrate to her the spirituality of Judaism‚Äîthe larger part is devoted to immortality in the Old Testament. Aguilar's other religious writings ‚Äîsome of them written as early as 1836‚Äîwere collected in a volume of Essays and Miscellanies (1851‚Äì52). The first part consists of Sabbath Thoughts on Scriptural passages and prophecies; the second, of \\"Communings\\" for the family circle. In her religious writings Aguilar's attitude was defensive. Despite her almost exclusive intercourse with Christians and her utter lack of prejudice, her purpose, apparently, was to equip English Jewish women with arguments against conversionists. She inveighed against formalism, and laid stress upon knowledge of Jewish history and the Hebrew language. In view of the neglect of the latter by women (to whom she modestly confined her expostulations), she constantly pleaded for the reading of the Scriptures in the English version. Her interest in the reform movement was deep; yet, despite her attitude toward tradition, she observed ritual ordinances punctiliously. Her last work was a sketch of the \\"History of the Jews in England\\", written for \\"Chambers's Miscellany.\\" In point of style it is the most finished of her productions, free from the exuberances and redundancies that disfigure the tales‚Äîpublished, for the most part, posthumously by her mother. The defects of her style are mainly chargeable to youth. With her extraordinary industry‚Äîshe rose early and employed the day systematically‚Äîand her growing ability of concentration she gave promise of noteworthy productions.

Third patrol Robalo departed Fremantle on 22 June 1944 on her third war patrol. She set a course for the South China Sea to conduct her patrol in the vicinity of the Natuna Islands. After transiting Makassar Strait and Balabac Strait (which was well-known to be mined),Blair, p.687. she was scheduled to arrive on station about 6 July and remain until dark on 2 August 1944. On 2 July, a contact report stated Robalo had sighted a Fus≈ç-class battleship, with air cover and two destroyers for escort, just east of Borneo. No other messages were ever received from the submarine, and when she did not return from patrol, she was presumed lost. Fate of survivors On 2 August, a note was handed from the cell window of the Kempei Tai military prison on Palawan Island in the Philippines, to Ed Petry, an American POW from the Puerto Princesa Prison Camp who was passing by. The note was in turn given to Hubert D. Hough, Yeoman Second Class, who was also a prisoner at the camp. He contacted Trinidad Mendoza (Red Hankie), wife of guerrilla leader Dr. Mendoza, who had the Coastwatchers radio General MacArthur and Admiral Ralph Christie in Australia. From these sources, it was concluded Robalo was sunk on 26 July 1944, off the western coast of Palawan Island from an explosion in the vicinity of her after battery, probably caused by an enemy mine. Only four men swam ashore,[Ensign Samuel L. Tucker; QMC 1/Floyd G laughlin; SM3c Wallace K. Martin; Emc2 MAson C. Poston .p.100 \\"United States Submarine Losses World War II\\"] and made their way through the jungles to a small barrier northwest of the Puerto Princesa Prison Camp, where Japanese Military Police captured them and jailed them for guerrilla activities. On 15 August, they were evacuated by a Japanese destroyer and never heard from again. The exact fate of the survivors is unknown.USS Robalo Even though Admiral Christie knew better it was reported for morale reasons that all hands went down with the boat. However, other prisoners on Palawan reported that the boat's skipper, Lieutenant Commander Manning Kimmel, son of Admiral Husband Kimmel, was one of the survivors. After an air strike on Palawan, the Japanese were so angered that they pushed Kimmel and the other prisoners into a ditch, poured in gasoline, and burned them alive. This incident was reported by Clay Blair Jr., a submarine veteran of the war and author of the definitive work Silent Victory: The US Submarine War Against Japan (see Volume 2, pp660‚Äì662 for details). Robalo was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 16 September 1944. Robalo earned two battle stars for World War II service.Information on the fate of survivors is from Silent Victory, Vol 2, by Clay Blair, Jr. Discovery The wreckage of the Robalo was found by the Sea Scan Survey Team in May, 2019, east coast of Balabec Island.

For example, National Highway 1 has four spur routes: NH 1A, NH 1B, NH 1C, and NH 1D, the shortest of which is just in length (NH 1C) and the longest is (NH 1A). While the spur routes essentially originate at the parent National Highway, they are not merely secondary in status as some of the spur routes serve important cities in India. For example, Srinagar, the capital of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, is served by the spur route NH 1A. Some spur routes are specifically used to connect important Indian ports: NH 5A links Paradip with its parent NH 5 and NH 7A links Tuticorin with NH 7). Japan The Aomori Expressway (E4A) spur splits from the T≈çhoku Expressway (E4) In Japan, spurs of its expressways are usually designated with an added letter \\"A\\". This designation applies to all routes that are part of a \\"family\\" of routes with the \\"parent\\" route lacking the added \\"A\\". Examples of spur routes in the system include the Aomori Expressway (E4A), linking the T≈çhoku Expressway (E4) to the eastern limits of Aomori, and the Sasson Expressway (E5A), linking the D≈ç-≈å Expressway (E5) to Otaru; however, some expressways that lack the \\"A\\" designation could also be considered spurs, such as the Kansai-K≈´k≈ç Expressway (E71) or the ≈åita Airport Road (E97). New Zealand In New Zealand, spurs on state highways are usually designated with an added letter. Examples include SH 2B, linking SH 2 to Napier Airport, and SH 6A, linking SH 6 with Queenstown town center. Not all such alphabetic suffixes refer to spurs, however; ring roads and linking roads between highways are also so designated. Conversely, some State Highways could themselves be considered spurs, notably SH 78, New Zealand's shortest state highway, which links SH 1 in Timaru city center with the Port of Timaru. Such spurs and spur roads leading from smaller urban thoroughfares to individual facilities are often referred to in New Zealand as \\"feeder roads\\". Romania All national roads, local roads and county roads have spur routes. A good example is DN1 and DN1A. DN1A goes from Bucure»ôti to Bra»ôov via Buftea, and have an intersection with DN1 at Ploie»ôti. After Ploie»ôti, DN1A goes to VƒÉlenii de Munte, Cheia, and then DN1A goes directly onto the Bra»ôov.  United Kingdom  In the UK, a spur route carries the same definition, but the numbering rules differ.  Same-number spurs  Short spurs from primary roads or motorways typically are not given a unique number, and three arms of the junction will apparently have the same number. For example, the A14 has a same-number spur to the A1(M) motorway at Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, the M23 motorway has one to Gatwick Airport in West Sussex and the M4 has one to Heathrow Airport. To distinguish the spur on road signs, the road it leads to is usually given - for example \\"Gatwick Airport (A23)\\".  Unique-number spurs  Typically, slightly longer spurs, or those with intermediate junctions of their own, are given unique numbers to distinguish them from their parent road, for example, the A48(M) motorway, a spur of the M4. There is a loose numbering system for these spurs on the motorway network, not dissimilar to the US system ‚Äì the road takes a three-digit number derived from that of the parent road. Examples include the M602 motorway (spur of the M60 and M62 motorways), M621 motorway (spur of the M62 and M1 motorways), and M271 motorway (spur of the M27 motorway). There are anomalous spur numbers though, for instance the M898 motorway (spur of the M8 motorway; number given to match with a unique A-number road) and the unique case of the M181 motorway, a spur of a spur M180 motorway, and that of the M18 motorway A-road spurs do not follow a noticeable numbering system; they would be impossible to assign due to the quantity of A-road numbers in use.  United States  Interstate 384, a spur of Interstate 84 in Connecticut Spur route of Washington State Route 100 In the US, many Interstate Highways have spur routes when they enter a large metropolitan area. Interstate spur routes are numbered with a three- digit number. The last two digits of the number are the number of the \\"parent\\" Interstate (Interstate 238, which connects Interstate 880 with Interstate 580 near Hayward, CA, is the only exception to this); e.g. a spur route of Interstate 90 could be 990; a spur route of Interstate 5 could be 105. Spur Interstate routes have three-digit numbers with an odd first digit. A subsidiary route either passing through a city or bypassing it and then reconnecting to a major highway would receive an even first digit, and be considered a loop rather than a spur. For example, in the case of Interstate 5, Interstate 105 is a spur route ending at Los Angeles International Airport, whereas Interstate 405 begins and ends at Interstate 5, bypassing downtown Los Angeles. Spurs are also found branching from US highways, state routes, and county routes, often as extended onramps and offramps of expressways. There are many numbering violations in the spur route numbering system, thus the general rules above do not always apply (e.g. U.S. Route 400‚Äîthere is no parent \\"route 0\\").

Like his former co-pastor Homer G. Lindsay Jr., Vines is well known for his conservative and sometimes controversial public stances, as well as his wide-reaching influence in the Southern Baptist Convention and the local political arena. He retired from the First Baptist pulpit on February 7, 2006, and was succeeded by Mac Brunson. On February 4, 2007, Brunson named Vines Pastor Emeritus of the church. Biography Jerry Vines was born in Carrollton, Georgia near Atlanta in 1937. Before attending seminary, he pastored his first church, Centralhatchee Baptist Church, at the age of 16. He was educated at Mercer University, New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary, and Luther Rice University before pastoring in churches in Alabama and Georgia. While pastor of Dauphin Way Baptist Church in Mobile, Alabama he was elected President of the Alabama Pastors' Conference. He relocated to Jacksonville in 1982 to co-pastor the First Baptist Church with Homer G. Lindsay Jr. In June 1988, he was elected president of the Southern Baptist Convention, served two terms, and was supportive of the Southern Baptist Convention conservative resurgence. During his first 20 years at First Baptist Jacksonville, he baptized 18,177 people and oversaw the building of an $8 million preschool building, a $16 million auditorium and four parking garages, totaling almost $14 million. Vines also was influential in starting the First Baptist Church Pastors' Conference which drew thousands of ministers and church works from across the world. Vines announced his retirement from First Baptist in May 2005 and preached his last sermon as pastor of the church in 2006 at the close of the 20th annual Pastors' conference. In 2017, Vines enrolled in the Ph.D program at the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, TX. He has since started his own ministry, Jerry Vines Ministries. This ministry is an outreach to further educate pastors in different areas of the ministry. Vines is married to the former Janet Denney and they have four children and seven grand children. Controversy Vines sparked controversy in June 2002 for remarks he made at a Southern Baptist Convention conference that were critical of Islam and Muhammad. Referencing Ergun and Emir Caner's book Unveiling Islam, Vines said that \\"Allah is not Jehovah‚Ä¶ Jehovah's not going to turn you into a terrorist that'll try to bomb people and take the lives of thousands and thousands of people,\\" and that \\"Christianity was founded by the virgin-born Jesus Christ\\" while \\"Islam was founded by Muhammad, a demon-possessed pedophile who had 12 wives, and his last one was a 9-year-old girl.\\"\\"Vines calls founder of Islam a 'demon-possessed pedophile'\\" .

This reference was to Aisha, who is said to have been married to Muhammad when she was six years old and about nine when her marriage to Muhammad was consummated, according to several hadith or Islamic accounts of the life of Muhammad.For example , , , and , said to have been narrated by Aisha. Other hadith that report the same account are , ,, , . The comments stirred a brief national debate on \\"Islamophobia\\" and the demonization of Islam in relation to the War on Terrorism. Vines initially defended his comments and invited \\"Muslim scholars to explain their own documents to us all.\\"\\"Vines: No Apology To Muslims\\" . (June 17, 2002). News4Jax.com. He also refused to apologize for the statements or to meet with local Muslim leaders. He was heavily criticized, but was defended by fellow Baptist preacher Jerry Falwell, who wrote a letter supporting him. Falwell was asked about the letter during a 60 Minutes interview in October, and sparked an even greater outrage by declaring that he considered Muhammad a terrorist.\\"Zion's Christian Soldiers\\" .

The main Downtown Campus comprises several square blocks of property connected by above-ground crosswalks. The campus includes several auditoriums for services, a Sunday school building, and facilities for First Baptist Academy, a private K-12 school. First Baptist Church has its origins in the oldest Baptist congregation in Jacksonville, Bethel Baptist Church, established in 1838. The church experienced a period of considerable growth in the mid-20th century, eventually encompassing eleven square blocks of downtown Jacksonville. Several former pastors, including Homer G. Lindsay, Jr. and Jerry Vines, were widely influential in the Southern Baptist Convention, leading it in both growth and a shift towards conservatism. History=Early years First Baptist Church traces its origins to Bethel Baptist Church (now Bethel Baptist Institutional Church), the earliest Baptist church to be founded in Jacksonville. Bethel Baptist was established under co-pastors James McDonald and Ryan Frier in July 1838 with only six charter members, four whites and two blacks, the latter of whom were slaves of white members.Bartley, pp. 13‚Äì14.Rosser, p. 20. Membership quickly grew, with most early congregants being black slaves who received day passes from their masters to attend. The first meetings were held at \\"Mother Sam's\\", a local plantation, and in 1861 a permanent meeting hall was erected in Downtown Jacksonville at Church and Julia Streets. The Bethel Baptist Church remained interracial until after the American Civil War, at which point the decision was made to segregate the congregation by race. White members attempted to force out the blacks, and took their case to court. However, the court found in favor of the blacks, who were in the majority, determining that they were the rightful owners of the Bethel Baptist name and property. As a result the whites left the congregation, forming Tabernacle Baptist Church, which was eventually renamed First Baptist Church. In 1866 Tabernacle Baptist Church purchased the Church Street property from Bethel Baptist Church, as was required by the court. The church went through a number of changes over the next years, and in 1892 it moved to its current location between Church and Hogan Streets, adopting the name First Baptist Church. The building was entirely destroyed in the Great Fire of 1901, which ravaged downtown Jacksonville. In 1903 the foundation was laid for a new building, which was completed within a year. This building, now known as Hobson Auditorium, still serves as part of the larger First Baptist complex. 20th century to present The church did not fare well in the early 20th century. By 1940, First Baptist had accumulated a debt of $125,000 and saw its educational building repossessed by its creditors. That year, the church hired Homer Lindsay Sr. as their senior pastor. Under his leadership the church reversed its fortunes, and within a few years it paid off its debt, acquired a new education building, and grew its congregation. In 1969 First Baptist hired Lindsay's son, Homer G. Lindsay Jr., as co-pastor; he took over sole pastoral duties upon his father's retirement in 1975. Under Lindsay Jr. the church experienced even faster growth, emerging as a megachurch with thousands of members and many new buildings, including a new 3,500-seat auditorium. Jerry Vines joined Lindsay as co-pastor in 1982. First Baptist grew even further, becoming a major power in the Southern Baptist Convention and adding a 10,000-seat auditorium in 1993. Vines became a key leader in the growing Convention and was a major figure in its shift toward strict conservatism. Vines and First Baptist Church received national attention in June 2002 for Vines' controversial statements regarding Islam.Vines calls founder of Islam a 'demon-possessed pedophile'  Friday, June 14, 2002 Lindsay died in 2000 and Vines retired in 2006; Mac Brunson was hired as senior pastor that year. Recent developments include the establishment of First Baptist Academy and of a satellite campus of the church in neighboring St. Johns County. Heath Lambert is the current senior pastor.\\"Heath Lambert, Senior Pastor,\\" FBC JAX, 2018. Retrieved 3 Nov. 2018.

It is an open problem in the field of number theory and is widely recognized as one of the most challenging mathematical problems. The conjecture was chosen as one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems listed by the Clay Mathematics Institute, which has offered a $1,000,000 prize for the first correct proof.Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture at Clay Mathematics Institute It is named after mathematicians Bryan Birch and Peter Swinnerton-Dyer, who developed the conjecture during the first half of the 1960s with the help of machine computation. , only special cases of the conjecture have been proven. The modern formulation of the conjecture relates arithmetic data associated with an elliptic curve E over a number field K to the behaviour of the Hasse‚ÄìWeil L-function L(E, s) of E at s = 1\\\\. More specifically, it is conjectured that the rank of the abelian group E(K) of points of E is the order of the zero of L(E, s) at s = 1, and the first non-zero coefficient in the Taylor expansion of L(E, s) at s = 1 is given by more refined arithmetic data attached to E over K .  Background  proved Mordell's theorem: the group of rational points on an elliptic curve has a finite basis. This means that for any elliptic curve there is a finite subset of the rational points on the curve, from which all further rational points may be generated. If the number of rational points on a curve is infinite then some point in a finite basis must have infinite order. The number of independent basis points with infinite order is called the rank of the curve, and is an important invariant property of an elliptic curve. If the rank of an elliptic curve is 0, then the curve has only a finite number of rational points. On the other hand, if the rank of the curve is greater than 0, then the curve has an infinite number of rational points. Although Mordell's theorem shows that the rank of an elliptic curve is always finite, it does not give an effective method for calculating the rank of every curve. The rank of certain elliptic curves can be calculated using numerical methods but (in the current state of knowledge) it is unknown if these methods handle all curves. An L-function L(E, s) can be defined for an elliptic curve E by constructing an Euler product from the number of points on the curve modulo each prime p. This L-function is analogous to the Riemann zeta function and the Dirichlet L-series that is defined for a binary quadratic form. It is a special case of a Hasse‚ÄìWeil L-function. The natural definition of L(E, s) only converges for values of s in the complex plane with Re(s) > 3/2. Helmut Hasse conjectured that L(E, s) could be extended by analytic continuation to the whole complex plane. This conjecture was first proved by for elliptic curves with complex multiplication. It was subsequently shown to be true for all elliptic curves over Q, as a consequence of the modularity theorem. Finding rational points on a general elliptic curve is a difficult problem. Finding the points on an elliptic curve modulo a given prime p is conceptually straightforward, as there are only a finite number of possibilities to check. However, for large primes it is computationally intensive.  History  In the early 1960s Peter Swinnerton-Dyer used the EDSAC-2 computer at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory to calculate the number of points modulo p (denoted by Np) for a large number of primes p on elliptic curves whose rank was known. From these numerical results conjectured that Np for a curve E with rank r obeys an asymptotic law :\\\\prod_{p\\\\leq x} \\\\frac{N_p}{p} \\\\approx C\\\\log (x)^r \\\\mbox{ as } x \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty where C is a constant. Initially this was based on somewhat tenuous trends in graphical plots; this induced a measure of skepticism in J. W. S. Cassels (Birch's Ph.D. advisor).. Over time the numerical evidence stacked up. This in turn led them to make a general conjecture about the behaviour of a curve's L-function L(E, s) at s = 1, namely that it would have a zero of order r at this point. This was a far-sighted conjecture for the time, given that the analytic continuation of L(E, s) there was only established for curves with complex multiplication, which were also the main source of numerical examples. (NB that the reciprocal of the L-function is from some points of view a more natural object of study; on occasion this means that one should consider poles rather than zeroes.) The conjecture was subsequently extended to include the prediction of the precise leading Taylor coefficient of the L-function at s = 1\\\\. It is conjecturally given by :\\\\frac{L^{(r)}(E,1)}{r!} = \\\\frac{#\\\\mathrm{Sha}(E)\\\\Omega_E R_E \\\\prod_{pN}c_p}{(#E_{\\\\mathrm{Tor}})^2} where the quantities on the right hand side are invariants of the curve, studied by Cassels, Tate, Shafarevich and others: these include the order of the torsion group, the order of the Tate‚ÄìShafarevich group, and the canonical heights of a basis of rational points .  Current status  A plot of \\\\prod_{p\\\\leq X} \\\\frac{N_p}{p} for the curve y2 = x3 ‚àí 5x as X varies over the first 100000 primes. The X-axis is log(log(X)) and Y-axis is in a logarithmic scale so the conjecture predicts that the data should form a line of slope equal to the rank of the curve, which is 1 in this case. For comparison, a line of slope 1 is drawn in red on the graph. The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture has been proved only in special cases: # proved that if E is a curve over a number field F with complex multiplication by an imaginary quadratic field K of class number 1, F = K or Q, and L(E, 1) is not 0 then E(F) is a finite group. This was extended to the case where F is any finite abelian extension of K by . # showed that if a modular elliptic curve has a first-order zero at s = 1 then it has a rational point of infinite order; see Gross‚ÄìZagier theorem. # showed that a modular elliptic curve E for which L(E, 1) is not zero has rank 0, and a modular elliptic curve E for which L(E, 1) has a first-order zero at s = 1 has rank 1. # showed that for elliptic curves defined over an imaginary quadratic field K with complex multiplication by K, if the L-series of the elliptic curve was not zero at s = 1, then the p-part of the Tate‚ÄìShafarevich group had the order predicted by the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, for all primes p > 7. # , extending work of , proved that all elliptic curves defined over the rational numbers are modular, which extends results #2 and #3 to all elliptic curves over the rationals, and shows that the L-functions of all elliptic curves over Q are defined at s = 1. # proved that the average rank of the Mordell‚ÄìWeil group of an elliptic curve over Q is bounded above by 7/6. Combining this with the p-parity theorem of and and with the proof of the main conjecture of Iwasawa theory for GL(2) by , they conclude that a positive proportion of elliptic curves over Q have analytic rank zero, and hence, by , satisfy the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. Nothing has been proved for curves with rank greater than 1, although there is extensive numerical evidence for the truth of the conjecture.  Consequences  Much like the Riemann hypothesis, this conjecture has multiple consequences, including the following two: * Let be an odd square-free integer. Assuming the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, is the area of a right triangle with rational side lengths (a congruent number) if and only if the number of triplets of integers (, , ) satisfying is twice the number of triplets satisfying . This statement, due to Tunnell's theorem , is related to the fact that n is a congruent number if and only if the elliptic curve has a rational point of infinite order (thus, under the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, its -function has a zero at ). The interest in this statement is that the condition is easily verified. *In a different direction, certain analytic methods allow for an estimation of the order of zero in the center of the critical strip of families of L-functions. Admitting the BSD conjecture, these estimations correspond to information about the rank of families of elliptic curves in question. For example: suppose the generalized Riemann hypothesis and the BSD conjecture, the average rank of curves given by is smaller than .

It was also marketed in Canada, Argentina, Portugal and Poland, as the Timex Computer 2068. A cut-down version, Timex Sinclair 2048, was cancelled before production. Timex Computer 2048, based on the TS2048 prototype was released in 1984 in Portugal and Poland. A variant of TS2068 was sold in Poland in 1986 under the name Unipolbrit Komputer 2086. HCM: East-European Home-Computer, homecomputer.de website. Article retrieved 2006-11-15. The final computer in the Timex line, Timex Computer 3256, was cancelled before production. Technical specifications The TS2068 was based on the ZX Spectrum and followed Timex's ZX81-based TS1000 and TS1500. Advertisements described the TS2068 as offering 72K of memory, color, and sound for a price under $200. Like the TS2048 was announced as a 40K memory machine (16K RAM + 24K ROM), so the 2068 was announced as a 72K machine (48K RAM + 24K ROM). The TS2068 was a more sophisticated device, significantly changed from its UK ancestor. Arguably one of the first Sinclair clones to significantly improve on the original design, it added a number of new features: * an AY-3-8912 sound chip, as later used by Sinclair in the ZX Spectrum+ 128K (but mapped to different I/O ports and thus incompatible) * twin joystick ports * a slightly better \\"chiclet keyboard\\" with plastic keycaps * a cartridge port to the right of the keyboard for ROM- based software * an improved ULA offering additional screen modes: ** The standard Sinclair 256√ó192 mode with a colour resolution of 32√ó24 ** Dual screens (two 256√ó192 pixels, 32x24 colour resolution screens can be placed in memory) ** An \\"extended colour mode\\", 256√ó192 pixels with colour resolution of 32√ó192 ** A monochrome 512√ó192 mode Sinclair BASIC was extended with new keywords (\`STICK, SOUND, ON ERR, FREE, DELETE, RESET\`) to address the new hardware and the machine offered bank-switched memory, allowing ROM cartridges to be mapped in. However, these changes made the machine incompatible with most Spectrum machine-code software, which is to say virtually all commercial titles; less than 10% would run successfully. In an attempt to remedy this, many TS users built a cartridge with a Spectrum ROM for emulation. The emulation was sufficiently accurate that it was able to run the majority of software produced for the Spectrum. Later, Timex of Portugal produced a Spectrum emulator cartridge that would auto-boot. This cartridge did not fit in a TS2068 as it was higher than TC2068 cartridges. The TC2068 casing was changed to accommodate this. Although Timex Computer Corporation folded in February 1984, the independent Portuguese division continued to sell the machine in Portugal as the Timex Computer 2068, and Poland until 1989, as the Unipolbrit Komputer 2086. Although the Portuguese-made TC2068 was also sold in Poland, only the UK2086 was actually made there. Timex of Portugal sold 2 versions of TC2068: the Silver TC2068 version came with a ZX Spectrum emulator cartridge and a black TC2068 version sold with TimeWord word processing cartridge plus the Timex RS232 Interface to use TimeWord with a RS232 printer. Strangely the black version came with a silver keyboard template with TimeWord commands to be used with the program. It can be removed because it is not glued to the black keyboard template. Although the TS2068's main improvements over the original Spectrum were in areas that had come in for widespread criticism (graphics, sound, keyboard and‚Äîto a lesser extent‚Äîthe lack of joystick ports and cartridge support), it was not used as the basis for the Spectrum's successors. The ZX Spectrum+ (1984) changed the keyboard only, and even the ZX Spectrum+ 128K (announced in May 1985, but not released in the UK until February 1986) retained the original machine's graphical capabilities. However, unlike the UK models, the TS2068 was not burdened by the requirement of compatibility with previous models. Differences between TS2068, TC2068 and UK2086 As Timex Computer Corporation made the TS2068 hardware-incompatible with the ZX Spectrum, Timex of Portugal made some changes to the TC2068: *Replaced the bus buffers with resistors like ZX Spectrum *Changed the I/O connector to be ZX Spectrum compatible (not requiring the Zebra Twister board). *Changed the cartridge slot top casing to accept bigger cartridges (ZX Spectrum emulator and Timeword cartridges will not fit in the TS2068 cartridge slot without modification of the slot) *Instead of 15V, it uses 9V. UniPolbrit also made some changes to the TC2068 for their Komputer 2086: *Modified ROM *Replaced a joystick port with a parallel printer interface Software List Timex Computer Corp published 7 cartridges and 37 cassettes to start the launch of the TS2068 (some titles were released both on cartridge and tape). The software was varied, ranging from utilities and personal accounting programs, to educational titles and games. All software have a \\"part number\\" and are grouped with all software of the same kind. 4 cartridges and 22 tapes planned were never released and from the known list, 10 titles are missing. Timex of Portugal released some more cartridges (ZX Spectrum Emulator and Time Word were sold with the TC2068), software in tapes and software on FDD disks. Tasword for Timex FDD was sold by Timex of Portugal. Reception Popular Mechanics in February 1984 called the Timex Sinclair 2068's keyboard a \\"mixed blessing\\" and reported a flaw in the video signal, but liked its BASIC and concluded that \\"for $200, the 2068 is a nice package\\". Timex Sinclair 2048 The Timex Sinclair 2048 was never produced. It was not released by Timex Corporation because of TS1500 failure. According to an early Timex Sinclair 2000 computer flyer, it would be a cut- down TS2068 with 16 KB of RAM. It had an added Kempston-compatible joystick interface and a monochrome high resolution mode for 80 column text.https://rk.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/computers/timex/ts2048.htm Timex Computer 2048 would be developed in 1984 based on TS2048. It was sold in Portugal and Poland. It seems that Timex Computer Corporation used the 2048 model number before. It was the intended model number for what finally got named Timex Sinclair 2068. In an interview with Lou Galie, senior vice president of technology at Timex, he tells what he claims to be the real story. Danny Ross, Timex Computer Corporation president, was giving a speech.

At one time, all species were placed in the genus Casuarina. Lawrence Alexander Sidney Johnson separated out many of those species and renamed them into the new genera of Gymnostoma in 1980 and 1982, Allocasuarina in 1982, and Ceuthostoma in 1988, with some additional formal descriptions of new species in each other genus. At the time, it was somewhat controversial. The monophyly of these genera was later supported in a 2003 genetics study of the family. In the Wettstein system, this family was the only one placed in the order Verticillatae. Likewise, in the Engler, Cronquist, and Kubitzki systems, the Casuarinaceae were the only family placed in the order Casuarinales. Members of this family are characterized by drooping equisetoid (meaning \\"looking like Equisetum\\"; that is, horsetail) twigs, evergreen foliage, monoecious or dioecious and infructescences ('fruiting bodies') cone-like, meaning combining together many outward- pointing valves, each containing a seed, into roughly spherical, cone-like, woody structures. The roots have nitrogen-fixing nodules that contain the soil actinomycete Frankia. In Australia the most widely used common name for Casuarinaceae species is sheoak or she-oak (a comparison of the timber quality with English oak). Male specimens bear no fruit and are perhaps therefore colloquially referred to as sheoak. Other common names in Australia include ironwood, bull-oak or buloke, beefwood,Cox, P., & Freeland, J. 1969. Rude timber buildings in Australia. Thames and Hudson. page 18. Cox states that the name 'she-oak' is derived from Native America sheac - beefwood. or cassowary tree.

Tall tales, such as those of the Baron, often feature unreliable narrators. An unreliable narrator is a narrator whose credibility is compromised. They can be found in fiction and film, and range from children to mature characters. The term was coined in 1961 by Wayne C. Booth in The Rhetoric of Fiction. While unreliable narrators are almost by definition first-person narrators, arguments have been made for the existence of unreliable second- and third-person narrators, especially within the context of film and television, and sometimes also in literature.Unreliable Third Person Narration? The Case of Katherine Mansfield, Journal of Literary Semantics, Vol. 46, Issue 1, April 2017 Sometimes the narrator's unreliability is made immediately evident. For instance, a story may open with the narrator making a plainly false or delusional claim or admitting to being severely mentally ill, or the story itself may have a frame in which the narrator appears as a character, with clues to the character's unreliability. A more dramatic use of the device delays the revelation until near the story's end. In some cases, the reader discovers that in the foregoing narrative, the narrator had concealed or greatly misrepresented vital pieces of information. Such a twist ending forces readers to reconsider their point of view and experience of the story. In some cases the narrator's unreliability is never fully revealed but only hinted at, leaving readers to wonder how much the narrator should be trusted and how the story should be interpreted. Overview=Classification Attempts have been made at a classification of unreliable narrators. William Riggan analysed in a 1981 study discernible types of unreliable narrators, focusing on the first-person narrator as this is the most common kind of unreliable narration. Adapted from his findings is the following list: ;The P√≠caro: a narrator who is characterized by exaggeration and bragging, the first example probably being the soldier in Plautus' comedy Miles Gloriosus. Examples in modern literature are Moll Flanders, Simplicius Simplicissimus or Felix Krull.Berlinale ;The Madman: a narrator who is either only experiencing mental defense mechanisms, such as (post-traumatic) dissociation and self-alienation, or severe mental illness, such as schizophrenia or paranoia. Examples include Franz Kafka's self- alienating narrators, noir fiction and hardboiled fiction's \\"tough\\" (cynical) narrator who unreliably describes his own emotions, Barbara Covett in Notes on a Scandal, Charles Kinbote in Pale Fire, and Patrick Bateman in American Psycho. ;The Clown: a narrator who does not take narrations seriously and consciously plays with conventions, truth, and the reader's expectations. Examples of the type include Tristram Shandy and Bras Cubas. ;The Na√Øf: a narrator whose perception is immature or limited through their point of view. Examples of na√Øves include Huckleberry Finn, Holden Caulfield and Forrest Gump. ;The Liar: a mature narrator of sound cognition who deliberately misrepresents themselves, often to obscure their unseemly or discreditable past conduct. John Dowell in Ford Madox Ford's The Good Soldier exemplifies this kind of narrator. It remains a matter of debate whether and how a non- first-person narrator can be unreliable, though the deliberate restriction of information to the audience can provide instances of unreliable narrative, even if not necessarily of an unreliable narrator. For example, in the three interweaving plays of Alan Ayckbourn's The Norman Conquests, each confines the action to one of three locations during the course of a weekend. Definitions and theoretical approaches Wayne C. Booth was among the first critics to formulate a reader-centered approach to unreliable narration and to distinguish between a reliable and unreliable narrator on the grounds of whether the narrator's speech violates or conforms with general norms and values. He writes, \\"I have called a narrator reliable when he speaks for or acts in accordance with the norms of the work (which is to say the implied author's norms), unreliable when he does not.\\" Peter J. Rabinowitz criticized Booth's definition for relying too much on facts external to the narrative, such as norms and ethics, which must necessarily be tainted by personal opinion. He consequently modified the approach to unreliable narration. Rabinowitz' main focus is the status of fictional discourse in opposition to factuality. He debates the issues of truth in fiction, bringing forward four types of audience who serve as receptors of any given literary work: # \\"Actual audience\\" (= the flesh-and-blood people who read the book) # \\"Authorial audience\\" (= hypothetical audience to whom the author addresses his text) # \\"Narrative audience\\" (= imitation audience which also possesses particular knowledge) # \\"Ideal narrative audience\\" (= uncritical audience who accepts what the narrator is saying) Rabinowitz suggests that \\"In the proper reading of a novel, then, events which are portrayed must be treated as both 'true' and 'untrue' at the same time. Although there are many ways to understand this duality, I propose to analyze the four audiences which it generates.\\"Rabinowitz,Peter J.: Truth in Fiction: A Reexamination of Audiences. In: Critical Inquiry. Nr. 1, 1977, S. 121‚Äì141. Similarly, Tamar Yacobi has proposed a model of five criteria ('integrating mechanisms') which determine if a narrator is unreliable. Instead of relying on the device of the implied author and a text-centered analysis of unreliable narration, Ansgar N√ºnning gives evidence that narrative unreliability can be reconceptualized in the context of frame theory and of readers' cognitive strategies. Unreliable Narration in this view becomes purely a reader's strategy of making sense of a text, i.e. of reconciling discrepancies in the narrator's account (cf. signals of unreliable narration). N√ºnning thus effectively eliminates the reliance on value judgments and moral codes which are always tainted by personal outlook and taste. Greta Olson recently debated both N√ºnning's and Booth's models, revealing discrepancies in their respective views. and offers \\"an update of Booth's model by making his implicit differentiation between fallible and untrustworthy narrators explicit\\". Olson then argues \\"that these two types of narrators elicit different responses in readers and are best described using scales for fallibility and untrustworthiness.\\"Olson, Greta: Reconsidering Unreliability: Fallible and Untrustworthy Narrators. In: Narrative. Nr. 11, 2003, S. 93‚Äì109. She proffers that all fictional texts that employ the device of unreliability can best be considered along a spectrum of fallibility that begins with trustworthiness and ends with unreliability. This model allows for all shades of grey in between the poles of trustworthiness and unreliability. It is consequently up to each individual reader to determine the credibility of a narrator in a fictional text. Signals of unreliable narration Whichever definition of unreliability one follows, there are a number of signs that constitute or at least hint at a narrator's unreliability. N√ºnning has suggested to divide these signals into three broad categories.N√ºnning, Ansgar (ed.): Unreliable Narration: Studien zur Theorie und Praxis unglaubw√ºrdigen Erz√§hlens in der englischsprachigen Erz√§hlliteratur, Wissenschaftlicher Verlag: Trier (1998). * Intratextual signs such as the narrator contradicting himself, having gaps in memory, or lying to other characters * Extratextual signs such as contradicting the reader's general world knowledge or impossibilities (within the parameters of logic) * Reader's literary competence. This includes the reader's knowledge about literary types (e.g. stock characters that reappear over centuries), knowledge about literary genres and its conventions or stylistic devices Notable examples=Historical occurrences One of the earliest uses of unreliability in literature is in The Frogs by Aristophanes. After the god Dionysus claims to have sunk 12 or 13 enemy ships with Cleisthenes, his slave Xanthias says \\"Then I woke up.\\" A more well-known version is in Plautus' comedy Miles Gloriosus (3rd‚Äì2nd centuries BC), which features a soldier who constantly embellishes his accomplishments while his slave Artotrogus, in asides, claims the stories are untrue and he is only backing them up to get fed. The literary device of the \\"unreliable narrator\\" was used in several medieval fictional Arabic tales of the One Thousand and One Nights, also known as the Arabian Nights. In one tale, \\"The Seven Viziers\\", a courtesan accuses a king's son of having assaulted her, when in reality she had failed to seduce him (inspired by the Biblical and Qur'anic story of Joseph). The unreliable narrator device is also used to generate suspense in another Arabian Nights tale, \\"The Three Apples\\", an early murder mystery. At one point of the story, two men claim to be the murderer, one of whom is revealed to be lying. At another point in the story, in a flashback showing the reasons for the murder, it is revealed that an unreliable narrator convinced the man of his wife's infidelity, thus leading to her murder.Pinault 1992, pp. 93‚Äì97. Another early example of unreliable narration is Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales. In \\"The Merchant's Tale\\" for example, the narrator, being unhappy in his marriage, allows his bias to slant much of his tale. In the prologue to \\"The Wife of Bath\\", the Wife often makes inaccurate quotations and incorrectly remembers stories. Novels Vanity Fair‚Äôs Becky Sharp as a man-killing mermaid, by the work's author William Thackeray: \\"There are things we do and know perfectly well in Vanity Fair, though we never speak them... In describing this syren, singing and smiling, coaxing and cajoling, the author, with modest pride, asks his readers all around, has he once forgotten the laws of politeness, and showed the monster's hideous tail above water? No! Those who like may peep down under waves that are pretty transparent, and see it writhing and twirling, diabolically hideous and slimy, flapping amongst bones, or curling round corpses; but above the water-line, I ask, has not everything been proper, agreeable, and decorous...?\\" The concept of the unreliable narrator is exploited and finessed in the Ry≈´nosuke Akutagawa short story \\"In a Grove\\" (Yabu no Naka) (1922). A classic example of conflicting testimonies, Akutagawa deliberately leaves the reader wondering whose perspectives are honest, but misguided, whose are deliberately false to suit their own ends, and whose fall somewhere in between. As such, the unreliablity of narrators is presented as something which can be complex, a facet of human perception, rather than as a single feature of discourse.Kirszner, L. and Mandell, S. (1993) Fiction: Reading, Reacting, Writing, Fort Worth: Harcourt Brace , p. 173 A controversial example of an unreliable narrator occurs in Agatha Christie's novel The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, a novel in which the narrator hides essential truths in the text (mainly through evasion, omission, and obfuscation) without ever overtly lying. Many readers at the time felt that the plot twist at the climax of the novel was nevertheless unfair. Christie used the concept again in her 1967 novel Endless Night. The same technique was employed baldly in William Makepeace Thackeray's 1847‚Äì48 serial and novel Vanity Fair‚Äîone of the few examples of an unreliable authorial narrator in the English novel‚Äîwhere he admits passing over the worst of Becky's misdeeds in silence while providing enough allusions and clues (including in the content and captions of the illustrations, also done by Thackeray) to show the way to those interested in them;. even their accuracy, however, is made dubious by his admission that he learned the story second-hand from the diplomat Tapeworm.. The Norwegian crime writer Sven Elvestad's 1909 The Iron Wagon is another early example of the trope. Similar unreliable narrators often appear in detective novels and thrillers, where even a first-person narrator might hide essential information and deliberately mislead the reader in order to preserve the surprise ending. In some cases, the narrator describes himself or herself as doing things which seem questionable or discreditable, only to reveal in the end that such actions were not what they seemed (e.g. Alistair MacLean's The Golden Rendezvous and John Grisham's The Racketeer). Crime novelist Jim Thompson used the device of a narrator who is belatedly revealed to be psychotic and possibly delusional repeatedly in his books, most notably The Killer Inside Me, Savage Night, A Hell of a Woman, and Pop. 1280. Many novels are narrated by children, whose inexperience can impair their judgment and make them unreliable. In Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884), Huck's innocence leads him to make overly charitable judgments about the characters in the novel. Ken Kesey's two most famous novels feature unreliable narrators. \\"Chief\\" Bromden in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest has schizophrenia, and his telling of the events often includes things such as people growing or shrinking, walls oozing with slime, or the orderlies kidnapping and \\"curing\\" Santa Claus. Narration in Sometimes a Great Notion switches between several of the main characters, whose bias tends to switch the reader's sympathies from one person to another, especially in the rivalry between main characters Leland and Hank Stamper. Many of Susan Howatch's novels similarly use this technique; each chapter is narrated by a different character, and only after reading chapters by each of the narrators does the reader realize each of the narrators has biases and \\"blind spots\\" that cause him or her to perceive shared experiences differently. The technique is often employed by Vladimir Nabokov. Humbert Humbert, the main character and narrator of Nabokov's Lolita, often tells the story in such a way as to justify his hebephilia (fixation on pubescent girls), in particular his sexual relationship with his 12-year-old stepdaughter. In Nabokov's Pale Fire, the reliability, sanity and intentions of the narrator, Charles Kinbote, is one of the central themes of the novel. The narrator of A. M. Homes' The End of Alice deliberately withholds the full story of the crime that put him in prison‚Äîthe rape and subsequent murder of a young girl‚Äîuntil the end of the novel. In some instances, unreliable narration can bring about the fantastic in works of fiction. In Kingsley Amis' The Green Man, for example, the unreliability of the narrator Maurice Allington destabilizes the boundaries between reality and the fantastic. The same applies to Nigel Williams's Witchcraft.Martin Horstkotte. \\"Unreliable Narration and the Fantastic in Kingsley Amis's The Green Man and Nigel Williams's Witchcraft\\". Extrapolation 48,1 (2007): 137‚Äì151. An Instance of the Fingerpost by Iain Pears also employs several points of view from narrators whose accounts are found to be unreliable and in conflict with each other. Mike Engleby, the narrator of Sebastian Faulks' Engleby, leads the reader to believe a version of events of his life that is shown to be increasingly at odds with reality. Zeno Cosini, the narrator of Italo Svevo's Zeno's Conscience, is a typical example of unreliable narrator: in fact the novel is presented as a diary of Zeno himself, who unintentionally distorts the facts to justify his faults. His psychiatrist, who publishes the diary, claims in the introduction that it's a mix of truths and lies. Stephen Fry's 1991 novel The Liar follows the upper-class Englishman Adrian Healey through his years at public school, at Cambridge University, and afterwards. He excels at lying and entire chapters are later revealed to have been fictions (for which the reader could have been warned by the book's title). Pi Patel, the narrator of Yann Martel's 2001 novel Life of Pi, tells two conflicting versions of his story. After spending many days adrift at sea, he recounts a fanciful story in which he shared his lifeboat with a zebra, orangutan, hyena (which killed the zebra and orangutan), and tiger (which killed the hyena). When they question his story, he provides a darker, but more plausible recounting of events, in which a sailor and Pi's mother are murdered by the ship's cook, whom Pi then kills and eats to survive. The rescuers notice that the animals in the first story could be allegories for the people in the second one. Pi points out that neither story is provable and both have the same outcome, and the rescuers choose to believe the story featuring the animals, because it is a \\"better\\" story. In Alberto Manguel's 2008 novel Todos los hombres son mentirosos (All Men Are Liars), tales about the life of a deceased author, Alejandro Bevilacqua, are told by four different acquaintances of his. Both smaller and larger aspects of their stories often contradict each other, and the frame narrative is actually that of a young journalist who tries to deduce the ultimate truth about the life of Bevilacqua, in order to write a book about him. Iain Pears's historical mystery novel An Instance of the Fingerpost consists of four accounts narrated by diverse 17th Century English characters. One of them begins by boasting to the reader of his great success and his rich and luxurious life, which he describes in detail. In the end, however, it turns out that in fact all his schemes ended in utter and abject failure and that - unable to face that disaster - he had gone mad and was confined in Bedlam, where he lives in complete illusion, unable to comprehend his real situation. Malcolm Bannister, the protagonist and narrator of John Grisham's novel The Racketeer tells the reader at length of his getting out of prison by providing the FBI with incriminating information about drug dealer Quinn Rucker - which exposes him to Rucker's revenge and requires him to go into the Witness Protection Program. Only later in the book does it turn out that Bannister had cheated both the FBI and the reader, that in fact Quinn Rucker is Bannister's best friend and that the two of them carefully planned Bannister's \\"betrayal\\" of Rucker as part of an elaborate plan, culminating with both of them free and in possession of very much gold. Jason, the first person narrator of Danny Wallace's novel Charlotte Street, starts off by telling the reader at great length about his being terribly broken up over his girlfriend Sarah having left him and become engaged to another man. When he tells of his work at the London Today weekly, he gives the clear impression that his contact with Zoe, the paper's editor, is strictly professional. Only more than halfway through the book does Jason revel to the reader that in fact Sarah left him over his having sex with Zoe. Home (2012) by Toni Morrison is a recent example where there are two main perspectives, the narrator and the first person, who tend to contradict one another, while the first person also proves to fail to convey full truths as a product of his failure to remember, while the narrator too fails to do so as a result of not truly knowing all, where their omniscient perspective, is not truly, omniscient. Films One of the earliest examples of the use of an unreliable narrator in film is the German expressionist film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, from 1920. In this film, an epilogue to the main story is a twist ending revealing that Francis, through whose eyes we see the action, is a patient in an insane asylum, and the flashback which forms the majority of the film is simply his mental delusion. The 1945 film noir Detour is told from the perspective of an unreliable protagonist who may be trying to justify his actions. In Possessed (1947), Joan Crawford plays a woman who is taken to a psychiatric hospital in a state of shock. She gradually tells the story of how she came to be there to her doctors, which is related to the audience in flashbacks, some of which are later revealed to be hallucinations or distorted by paranoia. In Rash√¥mon (1950), a Japanese crime drama film directed by Akira Kurosawa, adapted from \\"In a Grove\\" (1921), uses multiple narrators to tell the story of the death of a samurai. Each of the witnesses describe the same basic events but differ wildly in the details, alternately claiming that the samurai died by accident, suicide, or murder. The term \\"Rash√¥mon effect\\" is used to describe how different witnesses are able to produce contradictory accounts of the same event, though each version is presented with equal sincerity and each is plausible when considered independently of the others. The film does not select the \\"authentic\\" narrator from the differing accounts: at its conclusion, all versions remain equally plausible and equally suspect. In the film Forrest Gump (1994), the simple-minded title character narrates his life story, demonstrating misunderstandings that are clear to the audience, such as Apple Computer being a \\"fruit company\\", and that one would get paid for sustaining a \\"million-dollar wound\\". He states that the father of his beloved Jenny treated her well, not understanding that the man's ongoing kissing and touching of her and her sisters was indicative of sexual abuse. The ending of the 1995 film The Usual Suspects reveals that the narrator had been deceiving another character ‚Äì and hence the audience ‚Äì by inventing the events and characters he is describing from whole cloth, and rather than being the weak, humble, and quiet criminal he presents as, is in fact Keyser S√∂ze, the film's fabled crime boss. In the 1999 film Fight Club, it is revealed that its protagonist the Narrator has dissociative identity disorder and that some events were fabricated, which means only one of the two main protagonists actually exists, as the other is in the Narrator's mind. In the 2001 film A Beautiful Mind, it is eventually revealed that the protagonist has paranoid schizophrenia, and many of the events he witnessed occurred only in his own mind. In the 2002 film Hero, the protagonist is identified as an unreliable narrator by the antagonist, who responds by constructing his own alternate version of the false story. In the last part of the film, the protagonist tells the real story, which explains his presence in the current situation. In the 2003 film ‚ÄúIdentity‚Äù, ten strangers stranded at a desolate Nevada motel during a nasty rain storm become acquainted with each other when they realize that they're being killed off one by one. The protagonist turns out not only to be the ultimate unreliable narrator, but also the antagonist in this psychological thriller by James Mangold. In the 2007 film 300, the events of the Battle of Thermopylae are revealed to be a story told by Delios, the only one of the 300 Spartans to survive the battle. This explains the inhuman nature of many of the Persian soldiers and the immortals and tyrannical characterization of Persian emperor Xerxes. In the 2010 film Shutter Island, the viewer is led to believe the protagonist and main character, U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels, is on a mission to find the person who maliciously set a fire that killed Daniels' wife. At the end of the movie the viewer is left conflicted as they discover Teddy Daniels might be a patient in a mental institution, and the plot of the movie might have been a ploy to get Daniels over his past trauma. In the 2013 film The Lone Ranger, the narrator Tonto is identified quickly as potentially unreliable by a child attending a 1930s carnival sideshow and questioning him about the origin of the Wild West legend of the Lone Ranger. Tonto's story vaguely follows an alternative version of the story as told in the popular radio dramas and television series, but with novel disclosures of graphic details. Along with the child, the audience is left to make their own judgments about his reliability. In the 2019 DC Comics film Joker, Arthur Fleck is the central protagonist. Arthur depicts himself as a man who lived a sad life and had episodes in which he had delusions of grandeur. His delusional moments include being in the audience of his favourite late night comedy talk show, being in a relationship with his beautiful neighbour and his belief that he was the result of an affair between his mother and billionaire Thomas Wayne. Television As a framing device on the sitcom How I Met Your Mother, the main character Ted Mosby, in the year 2030, recounts to his son and daughter the events that led him to meeting their mother. Show creator Craig Thomas explicitly said in a 2008 interview that the narrator, \\"Future Ted\\" (voiced by Bob Saget), is unreliable. This is demonstrated in episodes such as \\"The Mermaid Theory\\", in which Future Ted struggles to remember the subject, among other details, of an argument between two characters. In some cases, the unreliability is not Ted's, as he is simply relaying details provided by others; an example appears in \\"I Heart NJ\\", when Robin supposedly flips over a car while riding a bike. The 2012-2015 TNT series Perception featured a protagonist Daniel Pierce (played by Eric McCormack), a talented but eccentric neuropsychiatrist with schizophrenia who assists the FBI on some of their most complex cases. Much of the plot tension revolves around the viewer being unsure of whether events are actually happening or are just inside the mind of Daniel Pierce. In the 2014 Showtime series The Affair, the storyline is set to two independent and overlapping re- tellings of the events surrounding the affair, neither of which are shown to be completely accurate. The 2015 USA Network series Mr. Robot features an unreliable narrator as the main character and also a plot-device. The 2015 anime series Gakkougurashi! (School-Live!) features the main character Yuki as an unreliable narrator. Despite that a zombie apocalypse happened, she still sees the world as if nothing has happened. This is due to her PTSD and her dissociative disorder. Critics have claimed that Yuri Katsuki, the title character in the Japanese anime series Yuri on Ice, is an unreliable narrator due to his anxiety. The FX television series Legion focuses on the mutant David Haller, who suffers from schizophrenia. Haller's fractured psyche acts as a plot-device, warping Haller's view of the world. Creator Noah Hawley described Haller as an unreliable narrator. The Netflix series You has the unreliable narrator Joe rationalize his relentless stalking of Beck throughout the first season and then of Love throughout the second. Comics In Alan Moore and Brian Bolland's Batman: The Killing Joke, the Joker, who is the villain of the story, reflects on the pitiful life that transformed him into a psychotic murderer. Although the Joker's version of the story is not implausible given overall Joker storylines in the Batman comics, the Joker admits at the end of The Killing Joke that he is uncertain if it is true. Video games Final Fantasy VII (1997) has been noted for its use of the unreliable narrator concept with its protagonist, Cloud Strife. Patrick Holleman and Jeremy Parish argue that the interactivity between the player and the protagonist sets Final Fantasy VII apart from films as well as other video games. According to Holleman, \\"no RPG has ever deliberately betrayed the connection between protagonist and player like FFVII does.\\" In The Stanley Parable, the unnamed Narrator is unreliable, especially when the player's actions contradict the narrative he presents. The Beginner's Guide has an unreliable narrator in the form of Davey throughout the game. Call of Juarez: Gunslinger features the main protagonist, Silas Green, who retells his stories in a bar but makes occasional mistakes, resulting in changes of environment and enemy type. Vitamin Connection has an unlockable play mode in which the story of the game is re-told from the perspective of rival character Pro- Biotic. As Pro-Biotic prefaces the story in this mode, he portrays himself as the hero, without acknowledging his defeat in the true story. Short stories \\"The Yellow Wallpaper\\" by Charlotte Perkins Gilman is an example of a story that is narrated unreliably. The story is told from the point of view of an unnamed woman who is suffering from postpartum depression. Her husband, who also serves as her in-home physician, states that her condition is nothing more than a \\"temporary nervous depression ‚Äì a slight hysterical tendency.\\" To overcome her depression, her husband prescribes her a regiment of inactivity: she is not to engage herself in anything that might overstimulate her mentally or physically. Unbeknown to her husband, the woman kept a secret journal where she chronicled her feelings of entrapment, her distaste with her situation, and her disgust of her surroundings, particularly emphasizing the yellow wallpaper that surrounds her. Eventually, she writes about her hallucinations of a woman that lurks behind the pattern of the wallpaper. In a fit of delusion, the narrator rips all of the wallpaper off the wall in order to free the woman imprisoned behind it. She then takes up the menial task of pacing around the room, just as the woman in the wallpaper did. Because the narrator's awareness is compromised due to her worsening mental state, her reliability is questionable. An example of a short story that has an unreliable narrator is \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\" by Edgar Allan Poe. The story is told by a mentally-unstable person who has killed someone. In the beginning of the story, we get the impression that the narrator is not mentally insane, but as the story goes the narrator true mind get revealed whenever he gets paranoid of someone finding out that he murdered someone. A good example of an unreliable narrator is \\"Hearts and Hands\\" by O. Henry. In this story narrator is a con man. Mr. Easton is handcuffed to a man. A woman noticed this as she greets the two men. Mr. Easton tell her that he is marshal and the man next to him is a man who got in trouble for counterfeit. At the end of the story the audience finds out that Mr. Easton is the real prisoner. The entirety of the story comes in to question.

As with the rest of the third season of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, this mini-series adapted footage and costumes from the eighteenth Super Sentai series, Ninja Sentai Kakuranger. During fight scenes (and during opening of the show) an alternate version of the MMPR theme song was played, saying \\"Go Go Alien Rangers\\" instead of \\"Go Go Power Rangers\\", although the premiere episode \\"Alien Rangers of Aquitar\\" still uses the \\"Go Go Power Rangers\\" theme. Synopsis The five Alien Rangers Picking up where the third season of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers left off, Master Vile has used the Orb of Doom to reverse the ages of everyone on Earth, including the Power Rangers, reducing them to children. However, unlike the last time, the rangers retain their memories of the proper time thanks to the Ninja Power Coins. Unfortunately, the rangers are unable to morph and fight; Zordon recruits the Alien Rangers of Aquitar for help. These Rangers are humanoid, partially aquatic aliens and though Earth's environment is ultimately inhospitable to them, they agree to help. Master Vile's plans are foiled, and he leaves in annoyance, but Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa remain and intend to conquer Earth. Hoping to restore everyone's proper ages, Billy Cranston builds a Regenerator powered by the Ninja Power Coins. However, only Billy is restored to normal before the device is stolen by Goldar and Rito Revolto. The Power Coins are then destroyed by Rita and Zedd. With the human Rangers' powers destroyed, only the Aquitian Rangers stand between Earth and the forces of evil, and they can't stay on Earth forever. Ultimately, Zordon realizes that only one thing can restore everything to normal: the Zeo Crystal, which the human Rangers had split into five sub-crystals and scattered throughout time to keep it safe from Master Vile. The five young Rangers are each sent back to a different country and point in time to find a sub-crystal. Upon success, they are returned to the present. All the while, the Aquitian Rangers, Billy, Zordon and Alpha 5 fend off the forces of Lord Zedd and Rita. The villains also plot to destroy the Command Center and steal the completed Zeo Crystal. Ultimately, Zedd and Rita succeed in summoning the Aquitian Rangers' arch-foe, Hydro-Hog, to destroy them. After a great deal of difficulty, the Aquitian Rangers destroy him. Meanwhile, Aisha Campbell acquires the final sub-crystal in Africa. However, she chooses to remain in exchange for the sub-crystal and new friend Tanya Sloan goes in her place. Once the Zeo Crystal is recombined in a machine devised by Billy, Earth is restored to normal. The teenaged Rangers bid thanks and farewell to their Aquitian counterparts, who return to Aquitar. However, Goldar and Rito Revolto steal the Zeo Crystal out of the Command Center and their bomb goes off soon afterwards. The Rangers are teleported to safety just before the Command Center is destroyed. Aftermath The series sets up the transition from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers to Power Rangers Zeo. The two-part premiere of the latter resolved the cliffhanger ending and established the Rangers' new powers (as well as new foes, the Machine Empire). The Aquitian Rangers are later seen or referenced in further seasons. Cestro returns unmorphed in \\"Graduation Blues\\", seeking Billy's help against the Hydro-Contaminators. Cestro later briefly appears with Delphine in \\"Revelations of Gold\\". The Aquitian and Zeo Rangers team-up in the \\"Rangers of Two Worlds\\" two-parter, the first instance on the series of two full teams appearing together. The two-parter also centered around Billy rapidly aging because of his use of the regenerator. In \\"Countdown to Destruction\\" in Power Rangers in Space, the Aquitian Rangers battle and are overwhelmed by Divatox's forces. Aurico later appears morphed in the Power Rangers Wild Force episode, \\"Forever Red\\", which saw every previous Red Ranger (save Rocky, as Jason returned to his previous role as Red Ranger, for which Rocky originally replaced him) united to stop the remnants of the Machine Empire. All five Rangers would later return in the series finale of Power Rangers Super Megaforce to battle alongside other veteran Ranger teams and the Megaforce Rangers. Characters=Aquitian Rangers * Aurico The Red Aquitian Ranger, portrayed by David Bacon. As field commander and second-in-command of the Alien Rangers, Aurico leads the Rangers in battle, and devises strategies that ensure victory. His symbol is the circle and he uses ninjutsu to vanish from one place and appear in another to dodge his enemies. He pilots the Red Battle Borg and, during his stay on Earth, the Red Shogunzord, as well. Years later he joined nine other Red Rangers to fight the Machine Empire on the moon. He did not appear unmorphed in this episode, and was voiced by Christopher Glenn. * Cestro The Blue Aquitian Ranger, portrayed by Karim Prince. Cestro is the brains of the team. A master of technology, he creates weapons and devices that get the Aquitian Rangers out of tough situations. He is entrusted with the power of the Blue Battleborg and Blue Shogunzord. The Blue Aquitian Ranger's symbol is the square. His special attack is called the Aquitar Water Fall. * Tideus The Yellow Aquitian Ranger, portrayed by Jim Gray. He is a very strong and levelheaded individual. He is also the first male Yellow Ranger, a tradition which occurs frequently in the Sentai counterpart, but does not happen again in the American releases until Dustin becomes the Yellow Wind Ranger in Power Rangers Ninja Storm several years later. Tideus was entrusted with the power of the Yellow Battle Borg and the Yellow Shogunzord. The Yellow Aquitian Ranger's symbol is the triangle. He can send yellow triangular energy beams at his enemies (created by slashing his sword through the air in a triangular motion). * Corcus The Black Aquitian Ranger, portrayed by Alan Palmer. He is the quietest member of the team, often lurking in the background, but fights with extreme ferocity against his enemies. The Black Aquitian Ranger's symbol is the pentagon. He controls the Black Battle Borg and the Black Shogunzord. * Delphine The White Aquitian Ranger, the leader of the Alien Rangers. She's portrayed by Rajia Baroudi. She is the first female leader and White Ranger. Her symbol is the arrow (left-pointing on her helmet's forehead, downward-pointing on her visor). She pilots the White Battleborg and the White Shogunzord. Delphine has more endurance and can survive far longer outside of water than her team. Allies * Billy Cranston He is portrayed as a child by Justin Timsit and as a teenager by David Yost. * Thomas \\"Tommy\\" Oliver He is portrayed as a child by Michael R. Gotto and as a teenager by Jason David Frank. * Rocky DeSantos He is portrayed as a child by Michael J.

Sorich). * Baboo He is voiced by Dave Mallow (credited as Colin Phillips). * Finster He is voiced by Robert Axelrod. * Hydro Hog He is voiced by Brad Orchard. *Monsters (note: all voice actors uncredited) **Parrot Top He is voiced by Matt K. Miller. **See-Monster He is voiced by Brian Tahash. **Crabby Cabbie He is voiced by Michael Sorich. **Garbage Mouth He is voiced by Matt K. Miller. **Brick Bully He is voiced by Richard Epcar the first time and by Brian Tahash the second time. **Professor Longnose He is voiced by Kirk Thornton. **Slotsky He is voiced by Jimmy Theodore. **Eric and Merrick, The Barbaric Brothers Voice actors unknown. **Bratboy He is voiced by Paul Schrier. **Witchblade She is voiced by Wendee Lee. **Arachnofiend She is voiced by Julie Maddalena. Zords * Battle Borgs Humanoid Zords used by each Aquitian Ranger that were brought with them from Aquitar to Earth. They are less armored and more agile versions of the Shogunzords (like in Kakuranger). They were controlled through telepathy. * Shogunzords The Aquitian Rangers also had access to the original Power Rangers' Shogunzords and were able to form the Shogun Megazord (most of the monsters they fought were eliminated this way). Along with the Falconzord, they could form the Shogun Mega Falconzord, which they used to defeat their most feared nemesis, the Hydro Hog. ArsenalWeapons= * Alien Power Coins The Aquitian Alien Rangers were given Power Coins by Ninjor, 1,000 years ago, though it is unknown if he granted them the ability to morph into Power Rangers or even when the Aquitian Rangers received the power. Unlike the others, the Aquitians drew their power directly from their Coins in order to morph, as they did not need to use a Morpher. * Aquitian Saber The main weapons used by the Alien Rangers in Season 3. They worked identically to the Earth-made Katana when in use, but had strange alien markings inscribed upon the blade, presumably to grant it greater cutting ability. * Aquitian Laser Small laser guns that could turn into a knife by removing the sheath. * Aquitian Fist A knuckle device.

It was founded in June 1986 in Cambridge, England by Alan Miles and Bruce Gordon, former employees of Sinclair Research, after Sinclair sold the rights for the Spectrum to Amstrad. They moved to Swansea, Wales, in May 1989, became a public company in July 1989 and went into receivership in June 1990.  The DISCiPLE and +D  As the ZX Spectrum became hugely popular, the lack of a mass storage system became a problem for more serious users. While Sinclair's response, the ZX Interface 1 and ZX Microdrive, was very cheap and technologically innovative, it was also rather limited. Many companies developed interfaces to connect floppy disk drives to the ZX Spectrum, one of the most successful being the Opus Discovery; however, these were all to some degree incompatible with Sinclair's system. MGT's approach was different. It produced two different floppy-disk interfaces for the Spectrum, first the DISCiPLE (marketed by Rockfort Products) and later the cut-down +D interface (marketed by MGT themselves). Both, however, shared certain features: * A Shugart-compatible port for connecting one or two floppy diskette drives (the de facto standard created by Shugart Associates) * A parallel printer port * A \\"magic button\\" The latter generated a non-maskable interrupt, freezing any software running on the Spectrum and allowing it to be saved to disk. This made it simple to store tape-based games on disk, to take screenshots and to enter cheat codes. A duplicate expansion connector at the back allowed other peripherals to be daisy chained, although the complexity of the DISCiPLE meant that many would not work correctly. However, the real innovation was in the ROM. Unlike most of the competing systems, this was compatible with the Sinclair's extended ROM, meaning that the same BASIC commands used to operate Microdrives or the ZX Printer now could control floppy disk drives or a standard parallel printer. As well as being BASIC- compatible, it also mimicked the machine code entry points in the ZX Interface 1 - the so-called \\"hook codes\\". This meant that any Microdrive-specific software could use floppy disk drives connected to MGT interfaces instead without modification, provided the hook codes were used. The floppy drives simply appeared to Microdrive-aware applications to be very big, fast Microdrives. Sinclair's Microdrive command syntax was so complex that a selling point of many disk interfaces was that their commands were simpler. While loading from tape required a simple: LOAD \\"progname\\" the equivalent Microdrive syntax was: LOAD *\\"m\\";1;\\"progname\\" Given the complexity of entering punctuation on the Spectrum's tiny keyboard, this was cumbersome. In addition to supporting the Sinclair syntax, MGT's code reduced the command to: LOAD d1\\"progname\\" Later, MGT produced the Lifetime Drive range of floppy disk drives (later named Universal Drive after concerns about warranty expectations). The drive was advertised as being compatible with major systems on the market at the time and comprised four models (3.5\\" and 5.25\\", with and without their own power supplies). Compatibility with various machines was achieved using a DIP switch and computer-specific cables. The SAM Coup√© MGT started working on their own home computer, the SAM Coup√©, early on, while profits from MGT's other product financed its development. The SAM was essentially a ZX Spectrum 48K-compatible system with enhanced graphics and sound, more interfaces, expanded memory and a new BASIC interpreter. The machine was eventually launched late in 1989. While technically advanced, it arrived too late to establish a market and resulted in the company's demise. The rights to the +D interface were sold to Datel Electronics Limited in an effort to finance the SAM Coup√©. Alan Miles and Bruce Gordon bought the assets of MGT to form Sam Computers. However, that was a temporary reprieve and that company also ceased trading in 1992.

Origin The exact origins of the terms 'beat music' and 'Merseybeat' are uncertain. The \\"beat\\" in each, however, derived from the driving rhythms which the bands had adopted from their rock and roll, rhythm and blues and soul music influences, rather than the Beat Generation literary movement of the 1950s. As the initial wave of rock and roll subsided in the later 1950s, \\"big beat\\" music, later shortened to \\"beat\\", became a live dance alternative to the balladeers like Tommy Steele, Marty Wilde, and Cliff Richard who were dominating the charts.B. Longhurst, Popular Music and Society (Polity, 2nd edn., 2007), , p. 98. The German anthropologist and music critic Ernest Borneman, who lived in England from 1933 to 1960, claimed to have coined the term in a column in Melody Maker magazine to describe the British imitation of American Rock'n'Roll, Rhythm & Blues and Skiffle bands. The name Mersey Beat was used for a Liverpool music magazine founded in 1961 by Bill Harry. Harry claims to have coined the term \\"based on a policeman's beat and not that of the music\\". The band the Pacifics were renamed the Mersey Beats in February 1962 by Bob Wooler, MC at the Cavern Club, and in April that year they became the Merseybeats.B. Eder and R. Unterberger, \\"The Merseybeats\\", Allmusic, retrieved 16 June 2009. With the rise of the Beatles in 1963, the terms Mersey sound and Merseybeat were applied to bands and singers from Liverpool, the first time in British pop music that a sound and a location were linked together. The equivalent scenes in Birmingham and London were described as Brum beat and the Tottenham Sound respectively.B. Eder, \\"Various artists: Brum Beat: the Story of the 60s Midland Sound\\", Allmusic, retrieved 5 February 2011. Characteristics The most distinctive characteristic of beat music was its strong beat, using the backbeat common to rock and roll and rhythm and blues, but often with a driving emphasis on all the beats of 4/4 bar.P. Hurry, M. Phillips and M. Richards, Heinemann Advanced Music (Heinemann, 2001), p. 158. The rhythm itself‚Äîdescribed by Alan Clayson as \\"a changeless four-four offbeat on the snare drum\\"‚Äîwas developed in the clubs in Hamburg, West Germany, where many English groups, including the Beatles, performed in the early 1960s and where it was known as the mach schau (make show) beat. The 8/8 rhythm was flexible enough to be adopted for songs from a range of genres. In addition, according to music writer Dave Laing, > \\"[T]he chord playing of the rhythm guitar was broken up into a series of > separate strokes, often one to the bar, with the regular plodding of the > bass guitar and crisp drumming behind it. This gave a very different effect > from the monolithic character of rock, in that the beat was given not by the > duplication of one instrument in the rhythm section by another, but by an > interplay between all three. This flexibility also meant that beat music > could cope with a greater range of time-signatures and song shapes than rock > & roll had been able to\\". Beat groups usually had simple guitar-dominated line-ups, with vocal harmonies and catchy tunes.J. Shepherd, Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: Volume II: Performance and Production (Continuum, 2003), , p. 78. The most common instrumentation of beat groups featured lead, rhythm and bass guitars plus drums, as popularized by the Beatles, the Searchers, and others. Beat groups‚Äîeven those with a separate lead singer‚Äîoften sang both verses and choruses in close harmony, resembling doo wop, with nonsense syllables in the backing vocals.Nell Irvin Painter, Creating Black Americans: African-American History and Its Meanings, 1619 to the Present (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 261. Emergence The Dave Clark Five appearing on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1966 In the late 1950s, a flourishing culture of groups began to emerge, often out of the declining skiffle scene, in major urban centres in the UK like Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham and London. This was particularly true in Liverpool, where it has been estimated that there were around 350 different bands active, often playing ballrooms, concert halls and clubs. Liverpool was perhaps uniquely placed within Britain to be the point of origin of a new form of music. Commentators have pointed to a combination of local solidarity, industrial decline, social deprivation, and the existence of a large population of Irish origin, the influence of which has been detected in Beat music. It was also a major port with links to America, particularly through the Cunard Yanks, which made for much greater access to American records and instruments like guitars, which could not easily be imported due to trade restrictions.R. Stakes, \\"Those boys: the rise of Mersey beat\\", in S. Wade, ed., Gladsongs and Gatherings: Poetry and its Social Context in Liverpool Since the 1960s (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 2001), , pp. 157‚Äì66. As a result, Beat bands were heavily influenced by American groups of the era, such as Buddy Holly and the Crickets (from which group the Beatles derived their name, combining it with a pun on the beat in their music), and to a lesser extent by British rock and roll groups such as the Shadows.W. Everett, The Beatles as Musicians: The Quarry Men through Rubber Soul (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 37‚Äì8. After the national success of the Beatles in Britain from 1962, a number of Liverpool performers were able to follow them into the charts, including Gerry & The Pacemakers, the Searchers, and Cilla Black. The first act who were not from Liverpool or managed by Brian Epstein to break through in the UK were Freddie and the Dreamers, who were based in Manchester, a short distance away,Daily Telegraph \\"'Dreamers' star Freddie Garrity dies\\", 20 May 2006, accessed August 2007. as were Herman's Hermits and the Hollies.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra, and S. T. Erlewine, All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul (Backbeat Books, 2002), , p. 532. Outside of Liverpool many local scenes were less influenced by rock and roll and more by the rhythm and blues and later directly by the blues. These included bands from Birmingham who were often grouped with the beat movement, the most successful being the Spencer Davis Group and the Moody Blues. Similar blues influenced bands who broke out from local scenes to national prominence were the Animals from Newcastle and Them from Belfast.I. Chambers, Urban Rhythms: Pop Music and Popular Culture (Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1985), , p. 75. From London, the term Tottenham Sound was largely based around the Dave Clark Five, but other London-based British rhythm and blues and rock bands who benefited from the beat boom of this era included the Rolling Stones, the Kinks and the Yardbirds.J. R. Covach and G. MacDonald Boone. Understanding Rock: Essays in Musical Analysis (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), , p. 60. British Invasion The arrival of the Beatles in the U.S., and subsequent appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, marked the start of the British Invasion The Beatles' appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show soon after led to chart success. During the next two years, the Animals, Petula Clark, the Dave Clark Five, the Rolling Stones, Donovan, Peter and Gordon, Manfred Mann, Freddie and the Dreamers, The Zombies, Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders, Herman‚Äôs Hermits, and the Troggs would have one or more number one singles in America.  Freakbeat  Freakbeat is a subgenre of rock and roll music developed mainly by harder-driving British groups, often those with a mod following during the Swinging London period of the mid to late 1960s. Freakbeat bridges \\"British Invasion mod/R&B;/pop and psychedelia\\". The term was coined by English music journalist Phil Smee. Allmusic writes that \\"freakbeat\\" is loosely defined, but generally describes the more obscure but hard-edged artists of the British Invasion era such as the Creation, the Pretty Things or Denny Laine's early solo work. Other bands often mentioned as Freakbeat are the Action, the Move, the Smoke, the Sorrows, and Wimple Winch. Decline By 1967, beat music was beginning to sound out of date, particularly compared with the \\"harder edged\\" blues rock that was beginning to emerge. Most of the groups that had not already disbanded by 1967, like the Beatles, moved into different forms of rock music and pop music, including psychedelic rock and eventually progressive rock.E. Macan, Rocking the Classics: English Progressive Rock and the Counterculture (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), , p. 11. Influence Beat was a major influence on the American garage rockV. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, All music guide to rock: the definitive guide to rock, pop, and soul (Backbeat Books, 3rd end., 2002), pp. 1320-1. and folk rock movements,R. Unterberger, \\"Merseybeat\\", retrieved 5 February 2011. and would be a source of inspiration for subsequent rock music subgenres, including Britpop in the 1990s.D. B.

He was held for 564 days before being released and allowed to return to the U.S. He died in the rectory of St.Domitilla Church in Hillside, Illinois, of cancer, in 1996. He is buried in The Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois. See his final resting place in FindaGrave.com submitted and created by Tim Kovacik. Life Jenco was taken hostage in Beirut by five armed men on January 8, 1985, while serving as director of Catholic Relief Services there. In his book, Bound to Forgive, Jenco relives his kidnapping and imprisonment, and offers portraits of the Shiite Muslims who held him captive. He also discusses how his faith sustained him. He spent much of his time in prayer and meditation, making a rosary out of threads from a sack, and celebrated clandestine Masses whenever he could. At times he was imprisoned with other hostages (see: Terry A. Anderson and Benjamin Weir ) who worshiped together as \\"The Church of the Locked Door\\". He spent much of his time chained and blindfolded, and was allowed to use the toilet only once a day. Jenco suffered serious eye infections and other health problems as a result of his captivity. In changing from one hiding place to another, he was bound with tape and placed in stifling hiding places in trucks, lest he be found by soldiers or police inspecting a vehicle. He also suffered beatings by the guards. After a period of 18 months' imprisonment, Jenco was freed on July 26, 1986, after months of negotiations involving the Reagan Administration, Shiite radicals and the Anglican envoy Terry Waite, who was himself later held hostage in Beirut for four and a half years. After his death, federal judge Royce C. Lamberth awarded the estate and family of Jenco $314.6 million in damages from Iran for the period he was held hostage in Lebanon. The ruling includes $14.6 million in compensatory damages to Jenco and his six siblings or their estates and $300 million in punitive damages. Jenco \\"was treated little better than a caged animal\\" said Lamberth in his ruling, which laid the blame upon the Iranian government. The Iranian government defaulted on the lawsuit, declining to answer any of the allegations. Victims of foreign terrorism are allowed by law to collect court judgments from the U.S. government. Toward the end of his captivity, Jenco was asked by one of his guards if he forgave his captors. Jenco tells in his book that at that moment he realised that he was being called to forgive, to \\"let go of revenge, retaliation and vindictiveness\\". Jenco received the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award for his capacity to forgive his captors having been held hostage for 18 months and tortured by religious extremists in Beirut. The Father Lawrence Jenco Foundation was created by fellow hostage and friend Terry Anderson after his death. It seeks to support people doing faith-based charitable work in Appalachia.

Enigmail works under Microsoft Windows, Unix-like, and Mac OS X operating systems. Enigmail can operate with other mail clients compatible with PGP/MIME and inline PGP such as: Microsoft Outlook with Gpg4win package installed, Gnome Evolution, KMail, Claws Mail, Gnus, Mutt. Its cryptographic functionality is handled by GNU Privacy Guard. In their default configuration, Thunderbird and SeaMonkey provide e-mail encryption and signing using S/MIME, which relies on X.509 keys provided by a centralised certificate authority. Enigmail adds an alternative mechanism where cooperating users can instead use keys provided by a web of trust, which relies on multiple users to endorse the authenticity of the sender's and recipient's credentials. In principle this enhances security, since it does not rely on a centralised entity which might be compromised by security failures or engage in malpractice due to commercial interests or pressure from the jurisdiction in which it resides. Enigmail was first released in 2001 by Ramalingam Saravanan, and since 2003 maintained by Patrick Brunschwig. Both Enigmail and GNU Privacy Guard are free, open-source software. Enigmail with Thunderbird is now the most popular PGP setup. Enigmail has announced its support for the new \\"pretty Easy privacy\\" (p‚â°p) encryption scheme in a joint Thunderbird extension to be released in December 2015. As of June 2016 the FAQ note it will be available in Q3 2016. Enigmail also supports Autocrypt exchange of cryptographic keys since version 2.0. In October 2019, the developers of Thunderbird announced built-in support for encryption and signing based on OpenPGP Thunderbird 78 to replace the Enigmail add-on. The background is a change in the code base of Thunderbird, removing support for legacy add-ons. Since this would require a rewrite from scratch for Enigmail, Patrick Brunschwig instead supports the Thunderbird team in a native implementation in Thunderbird. Enigmail will be maintained for Thunderbird 68 until 6 months after the release of Thunderbird 78. The support of Enigmail for Postbox will be unaffected.

The line was launched as the Sun Ultra Enterprise series; the Ultra prefix was dropped around 1998. These systems are based on the 64-bit UltraSPARC microprocessor architecture and related to the contemporary Ultra series of computer workstations. Like the Ultra series, they run Solaris. Various models, from single-processor entry- level servers to large high-end multiprocessor servers were produced. The Enterprise brand was phased out in favor of the Sun Fire model line from 2001 onwards.  Ultra workstation-derived servers  The first UltraSPARC-I-based servers produced by Sun, launched in 1995, are the UltraServer 1 and UltraServer 2. These are server configurations of the Ultra 1 and Ultra 2 workstations respectively. These were later renamed Ultra Enterprise 1 and Ultra Enterprise 2 for consistency with other server models. Later these were joined by the Ultra Enterprise 150, which comprises an Ultra 1 motherboard in a tower-style enclosure with 12 internal disk bays. In 1998, Sun launched server configurations of the UltraSPARC-IIi-based Ultra 5 and Ultra 10 workstations, called the Enterprise Ultra 5S and Enterprise Ultra 10S respectively.  Entry-level servers  Ultra Enterprise 450 The Sun Enterprise 450 is a rack-mountable entry-level multiprocessor server launched in 1997, capable of up to four UltraSPARC II processors. The Sun Enterprise 250 is a two-processor version launched in 1998. These were later joined by the Enterprise 220R and Enterprise 420R rack-mount servers in 1999. The 220R and 420R models are respectively based on the motherboards of the Ultra 60 and Ultra 80 workstations. The 250 was replaced by the Sun Fire V250, the 450 by the Sun Fire V880. The 220R was superseded by the Sun Fire 280R and the 420R by the Sun Fire V480. Ultra Enterprise X000/Enterprise X500 mid-range servers Ultra Enterprise 4000, rear In 1996, Sun replaced the SPARCserver 1000E and SPARCcenter 2000E models with the Ultra Enterprise 3000, 4000, 5000 and 6000 servers. These are multiprocessor servers based on a common hardware architecture incorporating the Gigaplane packet-switched processor/memory bus and UltraSPARC-I or II processors. High availability and fault-tolerance features are included in the X000 systems which are intended for mission- critical applications. The 3000 model is a deskside server configurable with up to six processors and 10 internal disks, while the 4000 is a rack-mount system with up to 14 processors. The 5000 is essentially a 4000 in a rack cabinet and the 6000 is a cabinet-housed data center server with up to 30 processors. In 1999, the Enterprise 3500, 4500, 5500 and 6500 models were announced. These are upgraded X000 systems, with a faster Gigaplane bus (up to 100 MHz, depending on processor clock speed, compared to 83 MHz). The 3500 also differs from the 3000 by having an additional Gigaplane slot resulting in an increased maximum of eight processors. The Enterprise X500 series were replaced by the Sun Fire 3800/4800/6800 line. Enterprise 10000 Sun Starfire 10000 The Enterprise 10000, E10k or Starfire (a development code name also used for marketing purposes) is a high-end multiprocessor data center server capable of being configured with up to 64 UltraSPARC II processors. This was largely designed by Cray Research's Business Systems Division as a successor to the Cray Superserver 6400, itself related to Sun's earlier Sun-4d architecture servers. After Cray was acquired by Silicon Graphics in 1996, this division was sold on to Sun, who then launched the Starfire as the Ultra Enterprise 10000 in 1997. The Starfire is based around the fault-tolerant Gigaplane-XB processor/memory interconnect. Like the X000 and X500 series servers, the Starfire incorporates many high-availability features, including the ability to be partitioned into multiple \\"domains\\", each of which can be booted individually to run its own instance of Solaris. It is also possible to remove resources from a running domain with short notice and reassign freed resources to other domains. Domain granularity is one CPU board (single system may have 1-16 of them). A single CPU board can carry up to 4 processors, 4GB of RAM and 4 SBUS IO boards. A rare option is to replace 4 SBUS boards with dual PCI boards. The Starfire is the first server from any vendor to exceed 2000 on the TPC-D 300 GB benchmark. Starfire systems were used by a number of high-profile customers during the \\"dot-com\\" boom, notably eBay, and typically sold for well over $1 million for a fully configured system. The Starfire contains one or two controller modules which are connected via Ethernet to an external computer, the System Service Processor (SSP). The controller modules interface with the system \\"centerplane\\" via JTAG and control the partitioning of available CPUs, memory and I/O devices into one or more domains, each of which is in effect a distinct computer. The system cannot be partitioned or booted without its original SSP which contains encrypted keys issued by the manufacturer. An E10K has been preserved at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View. The Starfire was superseded by the Sun Fire 12K/15K models.

Crash covers are a type of interrupted mail. Example of a salvaged U.S. Air Mail Crash Cover (CAM #24, Indianapolis, IN, Nov. 2, 1929) Crashes of flights carrying airmail were a regular occurrence from the earliest days of mail transport by air. In many cases of aircraft crashes, train wreck and shipwrecks, it was possible to recover some or even all of the mail being carried, with perhaps some charring around the edges of some pieces if there had been a fire, or water damage from flying boat crashes or shipwrecks. In such cases, the authorities typically apply a postal marking (cachet), label, or mimeograph that gets affixed to the cover explaining the delay and damage to the recipient, and possibly enclose the letter in an \\"ambulance cover\\" or \\"body bag\\" if it was badly damaged and then send it to its intended destination. Aviation related crash covers are a specialised collecting area of aerophilately and are much-prized items of postal history, because they are generally rare, but as tangible artifacts of often-tragic accidents they have a story to tell. The 367 covers salvaged from the Hindenburg disaster are especially desirable, with prices ranging from US$10,000 and up; a cover at the Corinphila auction in May 2001 realized 85,000 Swiss francs (US$75,000).

The traditional genre is dominated by the music brought to the region by the European settlers, the most well known of which are the Scots & Irish celtic and Acadian traditions. Successful pop acts from all genres have had degrees of national and international success since the beginning of recorded music period. Performers as diverse as Hank Snow, Stan Rogers, Anne Murray, the Rankin Family, Barachois, The Men of the Deeps and April Wine have all experienced tremendous success as popular music acts with considerable national and international tours and record sales. While closely related to the three Maritime provinces, Newfoundland and Labrador is culturally and politically separate. However, the two areas share a regional awards show, the East Coast Music Awards, and a common musical heritage. Traditional music The Maritime provinces are best known for the strong influence of Scottish and Irish settlers on the sound of the region's traditional music. This Celtic derived music is most strongly expressed on Cape Breton Island, which is especially well known for the Scottish influx in the late 18th century and early 19th century. Scottish-style fiddle music, sometimes accompanied by the piano, was popular at the time, and these traditions survive today. In some cases, like Cape Breton Island, Scottish folk traditions are better-maintained than in Scotland itself. The work of Helen Creighton and Louise Manny is particularly noted for documenting the traditional ballads and sea shanties of the region. The most notable of these songs being Farewell to Nova Scotia. The Miramichi Folksong Festival preserves the lyrics and music of northeastern New Brunswick, especially ballads from 19th and early 20th century lumber camps. The last two decades of the 20th century saw a revival in Maritime (Celtic music), spurred by a wave of similar roots revivals in Quebec and the rest of Canada, Scotland, Ireland and the United States. The first wave of Maritime traditional music was led by folk artist John Allan Cameron in the 1970s . By the late 1980s, Cape Breton had produced two crossover acts, the multi- platinum selling The Rankins and the less successful but critically acclaimed Barra MacNeils, Ashley MacIsaac, Natalie MacMaster, Lennie Gallant, and Slainte Mhath. Other modern performers have continued to add new influences to traditional Maritime music, including Gaelic lyrics in Mary Jane Lamond's Suas e!, Western classical music in Puirt a Baroque's Bach Meets Cape Breton and Middle Eastern musical influences in Laurel MacDonald's Chroma. South-eastern New Brunswick has seen a roots revival of their own Acadian traditions, dating back to before they were expelled to from Acadia.ÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøº Acadians play mostly a from of Western music. Barachois is probably the leading band of this revival, while The Gallants and The Arsenaults are two of the most famous Acadien musical families of the East Coast. Halifax, Nova Scotia has become a centre for black music in the Maritime provinces, both in the continuation of the traditions of the freed slave and loyalist blacks especially gospel music, and also with music arriving with African immigrants. Gospel groups have included the Gospel Heirs and the Nova Scotia Mass Choir. Popular music The region has made considerable contribution to national and international popular music, primarily by performers from Nova Scotia, though both New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island have made contributions as well. Heavy metal The Maritime provinces are a haven for many heavy metal acts with support for the genre especially strong in New Brunswick. Many new acts are of the death metal/black metal subgenres, one example being Obscene Eulogy, although all styles are represented.

Ordered in 1969, Balikpapan entered service with the Australian Army Water Transport Squadron in late 1971. After this, the decision to place all seagoing Army vessels under the control of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) saw Balikpapan transferred and commissioned in 1974; the last of the eight-vessel class to enter RAN service. Balikpapan was placed in reserve in 1985, but was reactivated three years later. During late 1999 and early 2000, the vessel was part of the INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce, and made additional deployments to East Timor in 2001 and 2006. On 12 December 2012, Balikpapan was retired from RAN service. Design and construction The eight-vessel Balikpapan class was ordered as a locally manufactured replacement for the Australian Army's LSM-1-class landing ship medium and ALC 50 landing craft.Gillett, Australian and New Zealand Warships since 1946, pp. 79, 125 They are long, with a beam of , and a draught of .Wertheim (ed.), The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World, p. 26 The landing craft have a standard displacement of 316 tons, with a full load displacement of 503 tons. They are propelled by two G.M. Detroit 6-71 diesel motors, providing 675 brake horsepower to the two propeller shafts, allowing the vessels to reach . The standard ship's company is 13-strong. The Balikpapans are equipped with a Decca RM 916 navigational radar, and fitted with two machine guns for self- defence. The LCHs have a maximum payload of 180 tons; equivalent to 3 Leopard 1 tanks, 13 M113 armoured personnel carriers 23 quarter-tonne trucks, or four LARC-V amphibious cargo vehicles.Gillett, Australian and New Zealand Warships since 1946, p. 79 As a troop transport, a Balikpapan-class vessel can transport up to 400 soldiers between a larger amphibious ship and the shore, or embark 60 soldiers in six-berth caravans for longer voyages. The vessel's payload affects the range: at 175 tons of cargo, each vessel has a range of , which increases to with a 150-ton payload, and when unladen. The flat, box- like keel causes the ships to roll considerably in other-than-calm conditions, limiting their ability to make long voyages. Balikpapan was laid down by Walkers Limited at Maryborough, Queensland on 1 May 1971, launched on 15 August 1971, and assigned to the Australian Army Water Transport Squadron on 8 December 1971.Wertheim (ed.), The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World, p. 25 After completing sea trials, Balikpapan began full operational service in 1972, with a combined RAN/Army crew.Gillett, Australian and New Zealand Warships since 1946, p. 124 Operational history In 1972, the decision was made that all Army seagoing vessels would be transferred to the RAN, with the Army retaining control of small landing craft and harbour support vessels. Balikpapan was transferred to the RAN and commissioned on 27 September 1974; as the other seven LCHs had commissioned into the RAN on completion, Balikpapan was the last to enter naval service.Gillett, Australian and New Zealand Warships since 1946, p. 80 Balikpapan was one of the first ships to depart for Darwin to render assistance after Cyclone Tracy hit that city in December 1974, sailing on 26 December from Brisbane with sister ship .Sea Power Centre, Disaster Relief During May and June 1984, Balikpapan completed a transit from Brisbane to Penang, transporting vehicles, equipment, and personnel to RAAF Butterworth.Swinden, Heavy Lifting for Four Decades, p. 22 Departing on 28 May, the vessel visited Cairns, Darwin, Jakarta, and Singapore, before unloading at Penang between 23 and 25 June. The landing craft returned via Singapore, Benoa, Darwin, and Cairns, and reached Brisbane on 7 August; the longest ocean voyage undertaken by a vessel of her class. Balikpapan was paid off into reserve at Cairns on 18 September 1985; one of three landing craft decommissioned for economic reasons. She was recommissioned in 1990, although initially only for use as a training vessel attached to the Royal Australian Naval Reserve Darwin Division. The vessel was seconded to Operation Beachcomber on several occasions between 1991 and 1995 for hydrographic duties. Balikpapan was deployed to East Timor as part of the Australian-led INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce.Stevens, Strength Through Diversity, p. 15 The landing craft was attached to INTERFET on two occasions; first from 20 September to 13 October 1999, then from 8 December 1999 to 15 January 2000. The ship was later awarded the battle honour \\"East Timor 1999-2000\\" in recognition of her service. From January to September 2000, the vessel was docked in Cairns for a life-of-type-extension refit. Post-refit, Balikpapan returned to East Timor to operate in support of UNTAET: November to December 2000, February to March 2001, May to June 2001, and July to August 2001. Balikpapan returned to East Timor in 2006 during Operation Astute. This vessel participated in Exercises Triton Thunder and Cassowary during May 2012. Balikpapan operated off Dundee Beach in the Northern Territory in concert with units from the Indonesian Navy and RAN Fleet Air Arm. Decommissioning and fate Balikpapan was decommissioned at Darwin on 12 December 2012. The Philippine Navy has shown interest in acquiring the ship, after the Australian government donated two other sister ships, and in 2015. It was later confirmed that the Philippine Navy is acquiring three more LCH from Australia, including ex-HMAS Balikpapan, at a token price.

It was created in 1789 for Thomas Thynne, 3rd Viscount Weymouth. The Marquess holds the subsidiary titles Baron Thynne, of Warminster in the County of Wiltshire, and Viscount Weymouth, both created in 1682 in the Peerage of England. He is also a baronet in the Baronetage of England. Family history until 1800 Sir John Thynne The Thynne family descends from the soldier and courtier Sir John Thynne (died 1580), who constructed Longleat House between 1567 and 1579. In 1641 his great-grandson Henry Frederick Thynne was created a Baronet, of Caus Castle, in the Baronetage of England (some sources claim that the territorial designation is \\"Kempsford in the County of Gloucester\\"). He was succeeded by his son, the second Baronet. He represented Oxford University and Tamworth in the House of Commons and also served as Envoy to Sweden. In 1682 he was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Thynne, of Warminster in the County of Wilts, and Viscount Weymouth, in the County of Dorset, with remainder to his younger brothers James Thynne (who died unmarried) and Henry Frederick Thynne and the heirs male of their bodies. Lord Weymouth died without surviving male issue in 1714 (one of his three sons, the Honourable Henry Thynne, represented Weymouth and Melcombe Regis and Tamworth in Parliament but had died in 1708, leaving only daughters) and was succeeded in the peerages (according to the special remainders) by his great-nephew, the second Viscount. He was the grandson of the aforementioned Henry Frederick Thynne, brother of the first Viscount. He married as his second wife Lady Louisa Carteret, daughter of John, Earl Granville, a female-line grandson of John, 1st Earl of Bath of the second creation (a title which had become extinct in 1711). Lord Weymouth was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Viscount. He was a prominent statesman and served as Secretary of State for the Northern Department and as Secretary of State for the Southern Department. In 1789 the Bath title held by his ancestors was revived when he was created Marquess of Bath. Unusually, the Earldom of Bath was revived during the Marquess's lifetime for Laura Pulteney, a relation of the Earls of Bath of the third creation. Place names used by existing peerages are normally avoided when new ones are created. This earldom went extinct on her death in 1808. Family history 1800‚Äìpresent The 1st Marquess's son Thomas, the 2nd Marquess, sat as Tory Member of Parliament for Weobley and Bath and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Somerset. His eldest son Thomas, represented Weobly in Parliament but predeceased his father by two months. Lord Bath was therefore succeeded by his second son Henry, the 3rd Marquess, who died three months later. He was a Captain in the Royal Navy and also sat as Member of Parliament for Weobly. His son John, the 4th Marquess, succeeded at age six; he was Chairman of the Wiltshire County Council and Lord-Lieutenant of Wiltshire. He was succeeded by his eldest son Thomas, the 5th Marquess. He was a Conservative politician and served briefly as Under- Secretary of State for India in 1895. His second but eldest surviving son Henry, the 6th Marquess, represented Frome in the House of Commons as a Conservative. The 6th Marquess's second but eldest surviving son, Alexander, the 7th Marquess, succeeded in 1992. He was a well-known politician, author and artist. In 2015 the Times described him as \\"a steaming pile of ancient kaftans and one of our wuffliest and weirdest mad-hatter aristocrats. He is best known for swanning around Longleat, his enormous Elizabethan pad in Wiltshire, entertaining his 75 concubines, or as he called them, ‚Äúwifelets‚Äù. The wifelets have included former Bond girls and Sri Lankan teenagers, as well as housewives and, according to some, prostitutes. The deal is simple: the wifelets get to hang out with Lord Bath in a jewel of a palace and in return he gets unlimited sex.\\"London Sunday Times; 6 Sept 2015 The titles are currently held by Ceawlin Thynn, the son of the 7th Marquess. Other family members Longleat, seat of the Thynnes The Honourable Henry Thynne, second son of the second Viscount, succeeded to the Carteret estates through his mother and assumed the surname of Carteret in lieu of Thynne. In 1784 he was created Baron Carteret with remainder to the younger sons of his brother the first Marquess of Bath (see the Baron Carteret for more information on this title). Several other members of the Thynne family have also gained distinction. The Reverend Lord John Thynne, third son of the second Marquess, was sub-Dean of Westminster Abbey; his seventh son was Major-General Sir Reginald Thomas Thynne (1843‚Äì1926). Lord Henry Thynne, second son of the third Marquess, was a Conservative politician and notably served as Treasurer of the Household from 1875 to 1880. Lord Alexander Thynne, third son of the fourth Marquess, represented Bath in the House of Commons from 1910 to 1918. The family seat is Longleat House. Coat of arms The arms borne by the Thynne family are: Quarterly: 1st and 4th, barry of ten Or and Sable (Botteville); 2nd and 3rd, Argent, a lion rampant with tail nowed and erected Gules (Thynne). This can be translated as: a shield divided into quarters, the top left and bottom right made of ten horizontal bars alternating gold and black (for the Boteville family); the top right and bottom left quarters white with a red lion rampant with a knotted tail (for the Thynne family).

Formed by guitarists Mana and K√∂zi, their earlier music and themes were characterized by their strong French and classical influences, later moving away from deliberate French romanticism and incorporating Gothic aspects after several difficulties befell the band. Malice Mizer was as famous for their live shows as they were for their music, featuring lavish historical costumes and stage sets, short silent theater pieces preluding various songs, and even a particularly notable instance of the vocalist descending to Earth (the stage) as a fallen angel, only to ascend again at the end of the concert. Throughout their history, the band has gone through several different lineups and three drastic image changes. At their peak, they were considered one of \\"the big four of visual kei\\" alongside La'cryma Christi, Fanatic Crisis and Shazna. On December 11, 2001, it was announced that Malice Mizer would go on an indefinite hiatus. Mana, K√∂zi and bassist Yu~ki have performed together several times since 2010. History=1992‚Äì1994: Tetsu era The Malice Mizer logo. After leaving Matenrou, guitarists Mana and K√∂zi formed Malice Mizer in August 1992 with Tetsu on vocals, Yu~ki on bass and Gaz on drums. The band's name is an abbreviation of \\"malice and misery\\", extracted from \\"Nothing but a being of malice and misery.\\" ‚Äî their reply to the question \\"What is human?\\" From the outset, the band established their trademark \\"twin guitar\\"' sound, whereby two guitars play different melodies creating polyphony. Malice Mizer's sound during the Tetsu era was a mixture of early 1980s gothic rock, progressive rock and strong classical influences. Their first official release was the song \\"Speed of Desperate\\" on the 1993 compilation Brain Trash. Before this, they had released a demo tape called \\"Sans Logique\\" (a nod to French pop singer Myl√®ne Farmer's hit song \\"Sans Logique\\") which contained no vocals. Shortly after the release of Brain Trash, Gaz left the band to join Kneuklid Romance, while Kneuklid Romance's drummer Kami in turn joined Malice Mizer. In 1994, after a couple more demos, the band released their debut album Memoire on Mana's newly founded independent record label Midi:Nette. It was re-released it at the end of the year with an additional bonus track, \\"Baroque\\", under the title Memoire DX. Only days later, singer and lyricist Tetsu left the band after his last gig on December 27, 1994. While the exact reasons are unknown, Tetsu went on to take a different direction in his work. The band's continued use of his lyrics in songs they continued to perform with later vocalists suggest an amicable split. 1995‚Äì1999: Gackt era Fans cosplaying as Mana, Yu~ki and K√∂zi in Shibuya, October 1998 After almost a year of inactivity, Malice Mizer recruited Gackt as their new vocalist and released the single \\"Uruwashiki Kamen no Shoutaijou\\" on December 10, 1995. With a new concept created by Mana, the band's music became more art rock and synthpop, incorporating even stronger classical and electronic elements. Visually, the band abandoned their 1980s goth look for colorful historical costumes with a gothic feel. In 1996, Malice Mizer released their second album, Voyage ~Sans Retour~. The band became increasingly popular and in 1997 signed with Nippon Columbia, where they released a number of successful singles, a short film (Bel Air ~Kuuhaku no Shunkan no Naka de~ de L'image), and, in 1998, their major label debut album, Merveilles. The band even had their own radio show around this time and played a two-day live at the Nippon Budokan, which involved a large building as a stage prop and elaborate theatrics; each member performing a skit with another member on their own (including [on \\"Le Ciel\\"] the aforementioned skit in which Gackt fell to the stage [to sing the song] and returned to \\"Heaven\\" by song's end). It was a massive success and was released on video as Merveilles l'espace. In July 1998, the Yokohama Arena's stage would be the last for Gackt as in January 1999, at the height of Malice Mizer's success, he would suddenly leave the band. No reason was given, but after just four months he would release his first solo EP. Malice Mizer left Nippon Columbia shortly after and returned to Midi:Nette. A few months after Gackt's departure, drummer Kami died of a subarachnoid hemorrhage on June 21, 1999. He left behind a handful of songs, which the band eventually released as part of the EP/video boxset Shinwa, which consists of two songs composed by him and the short track \\"Saikai\\" written by the band. Kami was never officially replaced; from that point on, Malice Mizer would only use support drummers (namely ex- Aion member Shu, who is not shown in the band's later promotional material, nor credited) and Kami would be credited as \\"eternal blood relative\\" on all their future releases. Possibly due to Kami's death and other factors, the band shifted to a \\"darker\\" image and sound. 2000‚Äì2001: Klaha era In the second half of 1999 and the beginning of 2000, Malice Mizer, still without an official vocalist, released a number of singles and began to work on a new album. Eventually, they recruited Klaha (vocalist of dark wave band Pride of Mind), officially inducted into the band as a full member in January. By then the band had abandoned the lighter pop music sound of the Gackt era for a dramatic mixture of classical music, dark wave, with slight heavy metal elements, and adopted an elaborate funerary elegant gothic look. In the summer of 2000, they released what would be their last album, Bara no Seidou. On August 31 and September 1, they gave a theatrical two-day live at the Nippon Budokan, featuring pyrotechnics, a choir of veiled nuns and a scaled-down cathedral as a stage prop. In 2001, Malice Mizer starred in a feature-length vampire movie (Bara no Konrei ~Mayonaka ni Kawashita Yakusoku~), and released three more singles: \\"Gardenia\\", \\"Beast of Blood\\" and \\"Garnet ~Kindan no Sono e~\\"; \\"Gardenia\\" and \\"Garnet\\" being of a considerably lighter tone than their previous album, suggesting another new era for the band. However, the band members decided to go their own separate ways in 2001, leaving messages on their official website, which can still be viewed today. The split was spoken of as a \\"hiatus\\", so as not to exclude the possibility of a future reformation. Post projects After his departure in 1994, Tetsu released one solo album, and has subsequently taken part in a series of bands such as Zigzo, Mega 8 Ball, Nil; his most recent being The JuneJulyAugust. After his departure in early 1999, Gackt started a solo career a year later which has been enormously successful; he is one of Japan's top musicians and TV personalities. Klaha started a solo career as well in December 2002, but in the middle of 2004 it was announced that his fan club would be closing down, and after that there have been long periods of silence, only broken by rare updates on his site. In 2007 he stated on his site that he would resume musical activity that year. But this did not happen and no information has been announced since. Yu~ki has not been active on the music scene since 2004 when he wrote the song \\"Memento\\", about Kami, for K√∂zi's solo project. In an informal conversation with Klaha, he said he would like to return to the music scene. K√∂zi formed the industrial duo Eve of Destiny with Haruhiko Ash (ex:The Zolge) and also started a solo career. As of Halloween 2008 he is part of the band Dalle. Around June 2010, K√∂zi started to perform with a band called My Horror Revue. He has also formed the band XA-VAT, who held their first performance on November 16, 2010 and released their first single on December 2. In 2012, he formed the band ZIZ with the musicians who supported him with his solo career. Mana has formed his own solo project Moi dix Mois, which has performed live concerts across Europe. In addition to the successful solo project, Mana is a designer for his fashion label Moi-m√™me-Moiti√© (created in 1999), which focuses on the styles Elegant Gothic Aristocrat and Elegant Gothic Lolita. He also continues to run his indie record label Midi:Nette, and has produced for artists such as Schwarz Stein and Kanon Wakeshima. Malice Mizer's song \\"Gekka no Yasoukyoku\\" was covered by D on the compilation Crush! -90's V-Rock Best Hit Cover Songs-, which was released on January 26, 2011 and features current visual kei bands covering songs from bands that were important to the '90s visual kei movement. Their song \\"Illuminati\\" was covered by Moran on its sequel, Crush! 2 -90's V-Rock Best Hit Cover Songs-, that was released on November 23, 2011. Original drummer Gaz died on December 22, 2017, due to illness. Deep Sanctuary reunions K√∂zi, Yu~ki and Mana performing together at the Deep Sanctuary V event in 2016. On December 27, 2008, K√∂zi played on stage with Moi dix Mois for a session gig at their Dis Inferno Vol.VI ~Last Year Party~ event. He joined them again in 2009, when they went on a short two show tour called Deep Sanctuary, on July 17 in Osaka and the 19th in Tokyo. A year later in July 2010, K√∂zi once again went on a tour with Moi dix Mois, titled Deep Sanctuary II. This tour had six shows, but the gig at Akasaka Blitz on the 17th was special, as Yu~ki was a special guest. This was the first time in 9 years that the three original members of Malice Mizer played together, and they were supported by Hayato (Moi dix Mois) on drums. They played \\"Saikai no Chi to Bara\\" and \\"Beast of Blood\\", as well as a cover of Rob Zombie's \\"What Lurks on Channel X?\\". In 2012, the three played together twice more for Deep Sanctuary III; once on September 12 at Akasaka Blitz and again on November 14, 2012 at Osaka Muse Hall. In 2014, another reunion of the three original members happened for Deep Sanctuary IV at Akasaka Blitz on October 11. This marked the first time they performed under the Malice Mizer name since 2001. It was followed by Deep Sanctuary V at Akasaka Blitz on August 7, 2016. On September 8 and 9, 2018, Mana, K√∂zi, and Yu~ki reunited as Malice Mizer to perform two shows for the band's 25th anniversary special at Tokyo Toyosu Pit. Titled Deep Sanctuary VI, Moi dix Mois and ZIZ also performed. They were supported on drums by Sakura, who was Kami's drum mentor, and who used Kami's original drum kit for the show. Former Malice Mizer roadies Shuji (Cali Gari), Kamijo, and Hitomi filled in as guest vocalists. A Blu-ray of the concert was released on June 21, 2019. Deep Sanctuary VII was scheduled to take place at Mynavi Blitz Akasaka on June 7, 2020, but was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. Influences Mana stated that the opening theme music scared him a lot in childhood and Malice Mizer's music has its roots in that experience.

The Original Poem The poem was published in 1599, six years after the poet's death. In addition to being one of the best-known love poems in the English language, it is considered one of the earliest examples of the pastoral style of British poetry in the late Renaissance period. It is composed in iambic tetrameter (four feet of unstressed/stressed syllables), with seven (sometimes six, depending on the version) stanzas each composed of two rhyming couplets. It is often used for scholastic purposes for its regular meter and rhythm. Influence of the Poem The poem was the subject of a well-known \\"reply\\" by Walter Raleigh, called \\"The Nymph's Reply to the Shepherd\\". The interplay between the two poems reflects the relationship that Marlowe had with Raleigh. Marlowe was young, his poetry romantic and rhythmic, and in the Passionate Shepherd he idealises the love object (the Nymph). Raleigh was an old courtier and an accomplished poet himself. His attitude is more jaded, and, in writing \\"The Nymph's Reply,\\" he rebukes Marlowe for being naive and juvenile in both his writing style and the Shepherd's thoughts about love. Subsequent responses to Marlowe have come from numerous other writers, including John Donne, Izaak Walton, Robert Herrick, C. Day Lewis, William Carlos Williams, Dorothy Parker, Ogden Nash, W. D. Snodgrass, Douglas Crase and Greg Delanty,. In about 1846 the composer William Sterndale Bennett set the words as a four-part madrigal. In the 1939 film, The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex, both poems are sung as a duet by Mistress Margaret Radcliffe (Nanette Fabray), singing Marlowe's original words, and Lady Penelope Gray (Olivia de Havilland) taking Raleigh's rebuttal. The performance infuriates Queen Elizabeth (Bette Davis) whose doomed love for Robert Devereaux, 2nd Earl of Essex (Errol Flynn), 32 years her junior, is the subject of the story. The line ‚ÄúCome live with me and be my love‚Äù was the inspiration for the 1941 film Come Live with Me, as well as the song Come Live with Me sung by Tony Scotti in the 1967 film Valley of the Dolls. It was also the third of the Liebeslieder Polkas for Mixed Chorus and Piano Five Hands, supposedly written by fictional composer P. D. Q. Bach (Peter Schickele) and performed by the Swarthmore College Chorus in 1980. In Birthday Madrigals (1995) John Rutter sets both poems, giving Marlowe's words to tenors & basses, with the women singing Raleigh's reply, and the men singing over the women, changing the feel from question and reply to two people not listening each other. The poem was adapted for the lyrics of the 1930s-style swing song performed by Stacey Kent at the celebratory ball in the 1995 film of William Shakespeare's Richard III. Other songs to draw lyrics from the poem include The Prayer Chain song Antarctica (1996) from the album of the same name, and The Real Tuesday Weld song Let It Come Down from their album The Last Werewolf (2011). In 2015, the Royal Shakespeare Company used a version of the song in its production (set at the end of World War I) of Much Ado About Nothing, under the name Love's Labour's Won, played by the character Balthasar (Harry Waller), and sung by the whole cast. The Passionate Shepherd to His Love - the Text > Come live with me, and be my love; And we will all the pleasures prove That > hills and valleys, dales and fields, Woods, or steepy mountain yields. And > we will sit upon the rocks, Seeing the shepherds feed their flocks By > shallow rivers to whose falls Melodious birds sing madrigals. And I will > make thee beds of roses, And a thousand fragrant posies; A cap of flowers, > and a kirtle Embroidered all with leaves of myrtle; A gown made of the > finest wool Which from our pretty lambs we pull; Fair lin√®d slippers for the > cold, With buckles of the purest gold; A belt of straw and ivy-buds, With > coral clasps and amber studs: And, if these pleasures may thee move, Come > live with me, and be my love. The shepherd-swains shall dance and sing For > thy delight each May-morning: If these delights thy mind may move, Then live > with me, and be my love.

In 1890 olive production was begun in a systematic manner. The Sylmar climate was also considered healthy, and so a sanitarium was established, the first in a series of hospitals in the neighborhood. There are fourteen public and eight private schools within Sylmar.

A study by four graduate students from the University of Southern California in 2005 stated that: > Sylmar in the 1970s and 1980s was a rural, predominantly white, non-Hispanic > community, whose residents focused on creating a place centered around > equestrian activities. Today, the dramatic influx of residents has serious > consequences for a community that has too little housing stock, too few > employment opportunities, overburdened public facilities and decaying public > infrastructure systems. The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $65,783, considered average for the city. History=Naming San Fernando became a city in 1874, leading to the naming of the unincorporated land surrounding San Fernando as Morningside. In 1893 the area was named Sylmar, a fusion of two Latin words for Trees and Sea.\\"San Fernando, 'at Mouth of Owens River,' Los Angeles Times, October 20, page V-13 Around 2000, some local residents proposed a plan to rename the northwest portion of the district as Rancho Cascades. The name change was approved in 2018. Sylmar has been nicknamed \\"The Top of Los Angeles.\\"Geoffrey Mohan and Rebecca Bryant, \\"Earthquake: The Long Road Back: Pride Bottoms Out in 'Top of Los Angeles,'\\" Los Angeles Times, January 23, 1994 Olives The foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains at the north slope of the San Fernando Valley were seen as \\"an unattractive and apparently worthless waste\\" before 2,000 acres of them were transformed in the late 1890s by the Los Angeles Olive Growers Association.\\"Los Angeles Olive Growers' Association,\\" Los Angeles Times, January 9, 1898, page 19 One observer recalled that the land had been \\"a mass of ill-looking chapparel [sic] and chemisal\\"[sic] before it was planted with olives.Joseph D. Lynch, \\"Olive Culture in Southern California,\\" Los Angeles Herald Sunday Supplement, December 31, 1905 Branch of a Mission olive tree Newspaper advertisement featuring Sylmar olives, 1920 Advertising for Sylmar olives on San Fernando Road, 1939 In 1893, a group of Illinois businessmen purchased from the trustees of the Maclay ranch either 1,000 or 2,000 acres (the sources differ) east of the railroad tracks on San Fernando Road just south of Roxford Street and in 1894 began planting olives trees on up to 1,700 acres.Ira Gribin, \\"Northernmost Town Integrally Tied to Development of Valley,\\" Los Angeles Times, June 20, 1981, page WS-B-17Another version states that in 1907 Paul Miltimore and F.D. Butterfield \\"formed a company and purchased 2000 acres,\\" of which 1,200 acres were planted in olive trees. Experts were brought from France to supervise the work.\\"Largest Olive Grove Is Sold,\\" Los Angeles Times, January 28, 1922, page B-1 Calling themselves the Los Angeles Olive Growers Association (in 1898 C.O. (Paul) Milltimore was the president and George L. Arnold the secretary), they built a packing plant and sold olives under the Tyler Olives label, later changing to the Sylmar Packing label. Sylmar's olives became noted throughout the state for sweetness and purity. Chinese pickers were hired to harvest the crops, and up to 800 U.S. gallons (3,000 L) of olive oil a day were produced. The pickling plant was located on the corner of Roxford Street and San Fernando Road. By March 1898 about 200,000 trees had been planted, and by 1906 the property had become the largest olive grove in the world.Sunset Magazine, August 1907: \\"A Sea of Trees, The Story of Sylmar, The Largest Olive Orchard In The World\\", by Bertha H. Smith.M.E.C., \\"How the Golden Oil Is Produced on the Largest Olive Grove in the World,\\" Los Angeles Times, July 8, 1906, page VI-11 One source stated in 1981 that it was the \\"Fusano family\\" who built a headquarters building for the olive association on Roxford and San Fernando in 1902 and that the first packing plant was built in 1909. The first groves were planted with Mission, Nevadillo Blanco and Manzanillo olives. Some Sevillano and Ascolano varieties were planted for extra-large fruit. During the picking season in the early 1900s, an extra force of 300 Japanese was employed and housed in a village of tents. In 1927 the packing plant, which had been built in 1910, employed some five hundred workers during its busiest season, November through January. The oil was pressed from the fruit, allowed to separate from the fruit's water content, then drawn into 12,000-gallon concrete tanks lined with glass and set deep into the ground to avoid a change in temperature. Over time, the plant expanded its activities, bringing in figs, pimientos and watermelon rind from the San Joaquin Valley for processing.\\"Mammoth Grove Keeps Olive Plant Busy,\\" Los Angeles Times, October 2, 1927, page J-5 In 1904 the Sylmar brand olive oil won first place at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, St. Louis, Missouri; in 1906 at the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition, Portland, Oregon;\\"Gold- Medal Olive Oil,\\" Los Angeles Times, October 18, 1905, page II-6 and in 1915 at the Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition in San Francisco.\\"For Best Olive Oil,' Los Angeles Times, June 11, 1915, page I-10 In 1922, the controlling interest in the Los Angeles Olive Growers' Association, which had been held by the estate of F.D. Butterfield (Charlotte M. Butterfied, the heir), was bought by Charles C. Moore of San Francisco, and its name was changed to Sylmar Packing Corporation. The management remained with Frank Simonds, who was president of the association. At that time there were 140,000 trees on the property.

Three people died at the Olive View Medical Center, including two patients on life-support systems that failed when auxiliary generators did not start. The third was an ambulance driver who was crushed by a falling wall. A hospital building sank a foot into the ground. About 600 patients were evacuated, 200 of them into a parking lot.

Many residents moved away from Sylmar, either from fear of more earthquakes or because their homes were destroyed. People bathed in the Pacoima Wash. Streets were buckled like washboards, with fissures up to a foot wide. On February 21, 1971, a rally of 1,500 people was held at a Little League baseball field to demand help from the government. Some government assistance and loans were indeed given to aid residents and to help rebuild.Robert A.

It was the worst tunnel disaster in California history, and it resulted in the state adopting the toughest mining and tunnel regulations in the nation and the establishment of its occupational safety division, commonly known as Cal/OSHA. The incident resulted in a 54-week criminal trial against the Lockheed Shipbuilding and Construction Company ‚Äî the longest municipal court trial in U.S. history.

The Sayre Fire was a November 2008 wildfire that resulted in the loss of 489 residences in or near Sylmar, the \\"worst loss of homes due to fire\\" in Los Angeles's history. The fire was first reported at 10:29 p.m. on November 14, 2008. It was not contained until November 20, 2008, and by then it had burned and destroyed more than 600 structures: 480 mobile homes, nine single-family homes, 104 outbuildings and 10 commercial buildings. Numerous schools in the area were closed during and for a few days following the fire, with air quality and other concerns being cited. Five firefighters and one civilian suffered minor injuries. Crime Sylmar is serviced by the Mission Community Police Station of the Los Angeles Police Department. =Drugs= Tipped off by a Sylmar resident, dozens of investigators from at least five police departments and three federal agencies raided a warehouse at 12898 Bradley Street, on September 29, 1989, and seized some 21.4 tons of cocaine and $10 million in cash. It was the largest confiscation of the drug in history, estimated at $6.9 billion, enough for 1.38 billion doses. Three men were convicted on drug charges in 1990.

Topography and climate Sylmar gently slopes upward as a geological alluvial plain and alluvial fan from an elevation of slightly more than 1,100 feet above sea level near San Fernando Road to slightly more than 1,700 feet above sea level at the crest of Hubbard Street. The overall range of elevation in Sylmar is approximately 600 feet. The slopes steepen into the San Gabriel Mountains on the north side of Sylmar resulting in steepene residential streets with homes built on man-made terraces. The Valley shares the Los Angeles Basin's dry, sunny weather, with only 17 inches (430 mm) annual precipitation on average. Snow in the San Fernando Valley is extremely rare, though the neighboring Angeles National Forest is capped with snow every winter. Although Sylmar is only 20 miles (32 km) from the Pacific Ocean, the Valley can be considerably hotter than the Los Angeles Basin during the summer months and cooler during the winter months. The average high temperature in summer is 95 ¬∞F (35 ¬∞C), dropping down to 68 ¬∞F (20 ¬∞C). In winter, the average high is 66 ¬∞F (19 ¬∞C) and average low is 40 ¬∞F (4 ¬∞C). Geography=Situation Sylmar touches the unincorporated Tujunga Canyons on the north, Lopez and Kagel canyons on the east, the city of San Fernando on the southeast, Mission Hills on the south, and Granada Hills on the southwest and west.

Half of these lands were placed on the market in 1897-98 at $350 an acre, with a minimum purchase of five acres. The terms were $350 in cash and $350 a year until paid for. The Olive Growers group would take care of the groves and, \\"When the premises are turned over to the purchaser at the end of four years, it is an established, profit- yielding property, without incumbrance.\\" There is no record as to the results of this plan. In 1922 the Taft Realty Company of Hollywood purchased 300 acres from Ben F. Porter and divided them into tracts containing one to fifteen acres each, which it planned to make into a townsite called Sylmar. Part of the acreage contained orange and lemon trees, and the rest had been used by the Ryan Wholesale and Produce Company for garden and truck farming. The land lay directly across the San Fernando Boulevard from the Sylmar olive grove and packing plant.\\"Taft Firm Will Open Subdivision,\\" November 5, 1922, page V-4 A later advertisement stated the name of the subdivision as \\"Sylmar Acres,\\" with \\"city lots\\" selling for $450 to $550.Advertisement, Los Angeles Times, February 11, 1923, page V-6\\"Announce Valley Tract,\\" Los Angeles Times, February 18, 1923, page V-6 The property of the Sylmar Packing Corporation, with frontage of more than 4.5 miles on Foothill Boulevard, was offered for sale in October 1938. At that time it was planted in olives, lemons, oranges and figs. A forty-acre section was to be set aside for a new townsite called Olive View and the rest subdivided into five- and ten-acre farm lots, with many streets already paved and public utilities installed. In the same month, manufacturer and landowner John R. Stetson announced his 200-acre property adjoining the Sylmar ranch would also be divided and offered for sale.\\"Large Valley Tract Opened,\\" Los Angeles Times, October 9, 1938, page E-2 =Postwar= A May 1962 proposal by the city Planning Department for an increase in density was met with disapproval by residents at a community meeting. The city's master plan for the area called for much of the agricultural land to be converted to suburban uses, plus zoning that would permit more apartments. There would also be expansion of industrial districts and more shopping centers. The plan proposed that the 4,500 acres then zoned for agriculture be reduced to 2,000, or 17% of the area.\\"Smaller-Lot Planned Rapped at Sylmar,\\" Los Angeles Times, May 13, 1972, page SF-1 City officials said that Sylmar had been the slowest of all San Fernando Valley communities to develop its multiple dwelling areas, with permits issued for only 35 units in 1961 and 70 units in 1962.\\"Commission Denies Plea for Sylmar Plan Change,\\" Los Angeles Times, March 1, 1963, page E-8 Sylmar's major growth came after the 1963 completion of the interchange between the Golden State and San Diego freeways and the 1981 completion of the 210 and 118 freeways, both of which made the community easier to reach. In 1971 city planners presented a land-use document that would preserve Sylmar's image as one of \\"houses, horses and orchards\\" and would roll back the then-existing projection from 90,000 residents by 1990 to 53,500.\\"City Goes Ahead With Sylmar Land-Use Plan,\\" Los Angeles Times, May 11, 1971, page SF-7 The population actually reached 53,392 in 1986. A proposal in 1980 to build an 80-unit low-income housing project near Sylmar High School at 13080-90 Dronfield Avenue was rejected by the Los Angeles City Housing Commission after eight thousand signatures were gathered against the plan and protesters filled a hearing in the high school auditorium.Irv Burleigh, \\"Why Sylmar Housing Plan Was Plowed Under,\\" Los Angeles Times, January 15, 1969, page SF-B-1] In 1984 Sylmar was still largely rural, but there was an area of industrial development in its southeastern portion.John Nielsen, \\"Panel Votes to Change Sylmar Plan,\\" Los Angeles Times, July 1, 1984, page V-4 In 1986, when its population was given 53,392, it still had some of the last large tracts of undeveloped land in the city, and the opening of the Foothill Freeway had placed it within a 45-minute drive of Downtown Los Angeles. Despite the population increase and a rise in the number of people living in condos and apartments, it was still one of the least- crowded areas of the city.Richard Simon, \\"Sylmar Retains Title of Fastest- Growing Area,\\" Los Angeles Times, April 17, 1988, page AV-6 Between 1980 and 1990 it was the fastest-growing area in the San Fernando Valley: Its population increased by 30.7% during those ten years in which the Valley itself grew by only 12.2%.\\"L.A. Area Population Growth,\\" Los Angeles Times, January 18, 1990 Reopening of the Olive View Medical Center in 1986 was seen as an impetus to population and business growth, as well as a threat to the horse-owning community. Practically every corner on Foothill Boulevard had been purchased for development, and a 109-room hotel was planned at Roxford Street, a block from the hospital. \\"We are bound to be concerned any time you start bringing sick people, mentally ill people, indigent people into our community,\\" said one community activist. \\"We welcome the hospital, but that doesn't mean we are going to sit back and let the influx of people change our life style.\\"Stephanie Chavez, \\"Fast-Growing Sylmar Bracing for the Boom From Its Hospital,\\" Los Angeles Times, March 18, 1986, page V-A-6 By 2006 Sylmar's open spaces were being rapidly subdivided. Resident Bart Reed noted that Sylmar was the last place in Los Angeles \\"where a builder can find a single- family home on half an acre. They can tear them down and build 52 homes\\" in their place. Longtime residents were concerned that the expansion would threaten their equestrian lifestyle in a community that still retained a largely rural atmosphere with corrals on large lots and horse trails that wound into the nearby San Gabriel Mountains.Amanda Covarrubias, \\"Horse Owners Are Bridling at Changes,\\" Los Angeles Times, March 17, 2006, page B-1 Institutions Sylmar has been the site of several public institutions. Olive View HospitalConstruction= Plans for a \\"tubercular home\\" to be established on a 414-acre or 453-acre Sylmar ranch purchased from John T. Wilson for $12,300 were announced in 1917. The hospital was to be jointly funded by Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties,\\"Tubercular Home May Be Located at Sylmar,\\" Los Angeles Times, October 7, 1917, page V-12\\"Three-in- One Hospital Plans Are Approved,\\" Los Angeles Times, April 8, 1918, page II-3\\"Great New Weapon Recently Forged by Los Angeles County for Use in Its Ceaseless War Upon the White Plague,\\" Los Angeles Times, March 9, 1919, page II-7 but this proposal for joint use was later abandoned. Olive View Hospital was operated as a branch of the Los Angeles County Hospital, and the sanitorium was built at an altitude of 1,700 feet; its property included not only \\"some picturesque canyons\\" but also sixty acres of level land \\"that will be well adapted for fruits, gardening and extensive chicken-raising,\\" whose purpose would be \\"to give some employment to patients who are able to work, this being considered a beneficial factor in their treatment.\\" Preparations for the construction, estimated to cost about $250,000, included reforestation of the foothills. A contemporary newspaper account noted that \\"Right through the grounds . . . passes the great pipe line of the Los Angeles aqueduct. Near at hand is also the pipe line for natural gas from the Kern County fields, and overhead runs the transmission line for the municipal electric system.\\" =Fire and earthquake= In 1962, fire rushed down Placerita Canyon and destroyed all the clinics, a dental suite and some other buildings. By 1965, plans were under way to improve the campus with $20 million in new construction.\\"$20 Million Olive View Hospital Project Rushed,\\" Los Angeles Times, January 26, 1965, page SF-8 In 1967 the construction cost had risen to $23 million for the six-story facility, which was planned to be the largest treatment center for respiratory ailments west of the Mississippi River. The hospital, which also housed a 30-bed psychiatric unit, opened in October 1970.\\"Olive View Hospital Will Have 800 Beds,\\" Los Angeles Times, October 1, 1967, page 5Paul Houston, \\"Took 'Direct Hit': Olive View Facility Called Total Loss,\\" Los Angeles Times, February 10, 1971, page B-2 On February 9, 1971, the new hospital was destroyed by earthquake (above) \\"It was like a bombshell scoring a direct hit,\\" said a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Engineer's office. Two patients and an employee died. Work to rebuild the hospital began but was halted for a time in June 1978 after California voters passed Proposition 13, which sharply limited the amount of money that could be assessed by local communities.Richard Simon, \\"Panel Backs Rebuilding of Olive View Hospital,\\" Los Angeles Times, June 11, 1981, page V-1 Eventually, the new $120 million hospital was completed, and it was opened in May 1987.Andrew C.

Handbuch der Lehre von der Verteilung der Primzahlen, page 17. Third (corrected) edition, two volumes in one, 1974, Chelsea 1974 that if the limit B exists, it must be equal to 1. An easier proof was given by Pintz in 1980.J. Pintz. On Legendre's prime number formula. Amer. Math. Monthly 87 (1980), 733-735.

It is informed by archaeology, anthropology, genetics, linguistics, and other disciplines; and, for periods since the invention of writing, by recorded history and by secondary sources and studies. Humanity's written history was preceded by its prehistory, beginning with the Palaeolithic Era (\\"Old Stone Age\\"), followed by the Neolithic Era (\\"New Stone Age\\"). The Neolithic saw the Agricultural Revolution begin, between 10,000 and 5000 BCE, in the Near East's Fertile Crescent. During this period, humans began the systematic husbandry of plants and animals. As agriculture advanced, most humans transitioned from a nomadic to a settled lifestyle as farmers in permanent settlements. The relative security and increased productivity provided by farming allowed communities to expand into increasingly larger units, fostered by advances in transportation. Whether in prehistoric or historic times, people always needed to be near reliable sources of potable water. Settlements developed as early as 4,000 BCE in Iran,Ma«ßƒ´dzƒÅda, Y. (2003). Jiroft: The earliest oriental civilization. Tehran: Organization of the Ministry of Culture ans Islamic Guidance.People, \\"New evidence: modern civilization began in Iran\\", 10 Aug 2007, retrieved 1 October 2007Xinhua, \\"New evidence: modern civilization began in Iran\\", xinhuanet.com, 10 August 2007 in Mesopotamia, in the Indus River valley, on the banks of Egypt's Nile River, and along China's rivers. As farming developed, grain agriculture became more sophisticated and prompted a division of labour to store food between growing seasons. Labour divisions led to the rise of a leisured upper class and the development of cities, which provided the foundation for civilization. The growing complexity of human societies necessitated systems of accounting and writing. With civilizations flourishing, ancient history (\\"Antiquity,\\" including the Classical Age, up to about 500 CE) saw the rise and fall of empires. Post-classical history (the \\"Middle Ages,\\" c. 500‚Äì1500 CE,) witnessed the rise of Christianity, the Islamic Golden Age (c. 750 CE ‚Äì c. 1258 CE), the Timurid and Italian Renaissance (from around 1300 CE). The mid-15th-century introduction of movable-type printing in Europe revolutionized communication and facilitated ever wider dissemination of information, hastening the end of the Middle Ages and ushering in the Scientific Revolution. The Early Modern Period, sometimes referred to as the \\"European Age and Age of the Islamic Gunpowders\\", from about 1500 to 1800, included the Age of Enlightenment and the Age of Exploration. By the 18th century, the accumulation of knowledge and technology had reached a critical mass that brought about the Industrial Revolution and began the Late Modern Period, which started around 1800 and has continued through the present. This scheme of historical periodization (dividing history into Antiquity, Post-Classical, Early Modern, and Late Modern periods) was developed for, and applies best to, the history of the Old World, particularly Europe and the Mediterranean. Outside this region, including ancient China and ancient India, historical timelines unfolded differently. However, by the 18th century, due to extensive world trade and colonization, the histories of most civilizations had become substantially intertwined, a process known as globalization. In the last quarter-millennium, the rates of growth of population, knowledge, technology, communications, commerce, weapons destructiveness, and environmental degradation have greatly accelerated, creating unprecedented opportunities and perils that now confront the planet's human communities. Prehistory=Early humans Genetic measurements indicate that the ape lineage which would lead to Homo sapiens diverged from the lineage that would lead to chimpanzees and bonobos, the closest living relatives of modern humans, around 4.6 to 6.2 million years ago. Anatomically modern humans arose in Africa about 300,000 years ago, and reached behavioural modernity about 50,000 years ago. Lascaux, France, c. 15,000 BCE \\"Venus of Willensdorf\\", Austria, c. 26,500 BCE Modern humans spread rapidly from Africa into the frost-free zones of Europe and Asia around 60,000 years ago. The rapid expansion of humankind to North America and Oceania took place at the climax of the most recent ice age, when temperate regions of today were extremely inhospitable. Yet, humans had colonized nearly all the ice-free parts of the globe by the end of the Ice Age, some 12,000 years ago. Other hominids such as Homo erectus had been using simple wood and stone tools for millennia, but as time progressed, tools became far more refined and complex. Perhaps as early as 1.8 million years ago, but certainly by 500,000 years ago, humans began using fire for heat and cooking. They also developed language in the Paleolithic period and a conceptual repertoire that included systematic burial of the dead and adornment of the living. Early artistic expression can be found in the form of cave paintings and sculptures made from ivory, stone, and bone, showing a spirituality generally interpreted as animism, or even shamanism. During this period, all humans lived as hunter- gatherers, and were generally nomadic. Archaeological and genetic data suggest that the source populations of Paleolithic hunter-gatherers survived in sparsely wooded areas and dispersed through areas of high primary productivity while avoiding dense forest cover. Rise of civilization The Neolithic Revolution, beginning around 10,000 BCE, saw the development of agriculture, which fundamentally changed the human lifestyle. Farming developed around 10,000 BCE in the Middle East, around 7000 BCE in what is now China, around 6000 BCE in the Indus Valley and Europe, and around 4000 BCE in the Americas. Cultivation of cereal crops and the domestication of animals occurred around 8500 BCE in the Middle East, where wheat and barley were the first crops and sheep and goats were domesticated. In the Indus Valley, crops were cultivated by 6000 BCE, along with domesticated cattle. The Yellow River valley in China cultivated millet and other cereal crops by about 7000 BCE, but the Yangtze valley domesticated rice earlier, by at least 8000 BCE. In the Americas, sunflowers were cultivated by about 4000 BCE, and maize and beans were domesticated in Central America by 3500 BCE. Potatoes were first cultivated in the Andes Mountains of South America, where the llama was also domesticated. Metal-working, starting with copper around 6000 BCE, was first used for tools and ornaments. Gold soon followed, with its main use being for ornaments. The need for metal ores stimulated trade, as many of the areas of early human settlement were lacking in ores. Bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, was first known from around 2500 BCE, but did not become widely used until much later. cuneiform inscription, Sumer, Mesopotamia, 26th century BCE Though early proto-cities appeared at Jericho and Catal Huyuk around 6000 BCE, the first civilizations did not emerge until around 3000 BCE in Egypt and Mesopotamia. These cultures gave birth to the invention of the wheel, mathematics, bronze- working, sailing boats, the pottery wheel, woven cloth, construction of monumental buildings, and writing. Scholars now recognize that writing may have independently developed in at least four ancient civilizations: Mesopotamia (between 3400 and 3100 BC), Egypt (around 3250 BC),Wengrow, David. \\"The Invention of Writing in Egypt\\", in Before the Pyramids: Origin of Egyptian Civilization, Oriental Institute, University of Chicago, 2011, pp. 99-103. China (2000 BC),James Legge, D.D., translator, \\"The Shoo King, or the Book of Historical Documents, Volume III, Part I, page 12]. Early Chinese Writing\\", in The World's Writing Systems, ed. Bright and Daniels, p.191 and lowland Mesoamerica (by 650 BC). Farming permitted far denser populations, which in time organized into states. Agriculture also created food surpluses that could support people not directly engaged in food production. The development of agriculture permitted the creation of the first cities. These were centres of trade, manufacturing and political power. Cities established a symbiosis with their surrounding countrysides, absorbing agricultural products and providing, in return, manufactured goods and varying degrees of military control and protection. Pyramid text, pyramid of Unas, Saqqara, Egypt, 24th century BCE The development of cities was synonymous with the rise of civilization. Early civilizations arose first in Lower Mesopotamia (3000 BCE), followed by Egyptian civilization along the Nile River (3000 BCE), the Harappan civilization in the Indus River Valley (in present-day India and Pakistan; 2500 BCE), and Chinese civilization along the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers (2200 BCE). These societies developed a number of unifying characteristics, including a central government, a complex economy and social structure, sophisticated language and writing systems, and distinct cultures and religions. Writing facilitated the administration of cities, the expression of ideas, and the preservation of information. Entities such as the Sun, Moon, Earth, sky, and sea were often deified. Shrines developed, which evolved into temple establishments, complete with a complex hierarchy of priests and priestesses and other functionaries. Typical of the Neolithic was a tendency to worship anthropomorphic deities. Among the earliest surviving written religious scriptures are the Egyptian Pyramid Texts, the oldest of which date to between 2400 and 2300 BCE. Ancient history=Cradles of civilization Great Pyramids of Giza, Egypt The Bronze Age is part of the three-age system (Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age) that for some parts of the world describes effectively the early history of civilization. During this era the most fertile areas of the world saw city-states and the first civilizations develop. These were concentrated in fertile river valleys: the Tigris and Euphrates in Mesopotamia, the Nile in Egypt, the Indus in the Indian subcontinent, and the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers in China. Sumer, located in Mesopotamia, is the first known complex civilization, developing the first city-states in the 4th millennium BCE. It was in these cities that the earliest known form of writing, cuneiform script, appeared around 3000 BCE. Cuneiform writing began as a system of pictographs. These pictorial representations eventually became simplified and more abstract. Cuneiform texts were written on clay tablets, on which symbols were drawn with a blunt reed used as a stylus. Writing made the administration of a large state far easier. Transport was facilitated by waterways‚Äîby rivers and seas. The Mediterranean Sea, at the juncture of three continents, fostered the projection of military power and the exchange of goods, ideas, and inventions. This era also saw new land technologies, such as horse-based cavalry and chariots, that allowed armies to move faster. Fresco, Knossos, Minoan Crete These developments led to the rise of territorial states and empires. In Mesopotamia there prevailed a pattern of independent warring city-states and of a loose hegemony shifting from one city to another. In Egypt, by contrast, first there was a dual division into Upper and Lower Egypt which was shortly followed by unification of all the valley around 3100 BCE, followed by permanent pacification. In Crete the Minoan civilization had entered the Bronze Age by 2700 BCE and is regarded as the first civilization in Europe. Over the next millennia, other river valleys saw monarchical empires rise to power. In the 25th ‚Äì 21st centuries BCE, the empires of Akkad and Sumer arose in Mesopotamia. Over the following millennia, civilizations developed across the world. Trade increasingly became a source of power as states with access to important resources or controlling important trade routes rose to dominance. By 1400 BCE, Mycenaean Greece began to develop. In India this era was the Vedic period, which laid the foundations of Hinduism and other cultural aspects of early Indian society, and ended in the 6th century BCE. From around 550 BCE, many independent kingdoms and republics known as the Mahajanapadas were established across the subcontinent. As complex civilizations arose in the Eastern Hemisphere, the indigenous societies in the Americas remained relatively simple and fragmented into diverse regional cultures. During the formative stage in Mesoamerica (about 1500 BCE to 500 CE), more complex and centralized civilizations began to develop, mostly in what is now Mexico, Central America, and Peru. They included civilizations such as the Olmec, Maya, Zapotec, Moche, and Nazca. They developed agriculture, growing maize, chili peppers, cocoa, tomatoes, and potatoes, crops unique to the Americas, and creating distinct cultures and religions. These ancient indigenous societies would be greatly affected, for good and ill, by European contact during the early modern period. Axial Age The Buddha Socrates Beginning in the 8th century BCE, the \\"Axial Age\\" saw the development of a set of transformative philosophical and religious ideas, mostly independently, in many different places. Chinese Confucianism, Indian Buddhism and Jainism, and Jewish monotheism are all claimed by some scholars to have developed in the 6th century BCE. (Karl Jaspers' Axial-Age theory also includes Persian Zoroastrianism, but other scholars dispute his timeline for Zoroastrianism.) In the 5th century BCE, Socrates and Plato made substantial advances in the development of ancient Greek philosophy. In the East, three schools of thought would dominate Chinese thinking well into the 20th century. These were Taoism, Legalism, and Confucianism. The Confucian tradition, which would become particularly dominant, looked for political morality not to the force of law but to the power and example of tradition. Confucianism would later spread to the Korean Peninsula and toward Japan. In the West, the Greek philosophical tradition, represented by Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and other philosophers, along with accumulated science, technology, and culture, diffused throughout Europe, Egypt, the Middle East, and Northwest India, starting in the 4th century BCE after the conquests of Alexander III of Macedon (Alexander the Great). Regional empires The millennium from 500 BCE to 500 CE saw a series of empires of unprecedented size develop. Well- trained professional armies, unifying ideologies, and advanced bureaucracies created the possibility for emperors to rule over large domains whose populations could attain numbers upwards of tens of millions of subjects. The great empires depended on military annexation of territory and on the formation of defended settlements to become agricultural centres. The relative peace that the empires brought encouraged international trade, most notably the massive trade routes in the Mediterranean, the maritime trade web in the Indian Ocean, and the Silk Road. In southern Europe, the Greeks (and later the Romans), in an era known as \\"classical antiquity,\\" established cultures whose practices, laws, and customs are considered the foundation of contemporary Western culture. Persepolis, Achaemenid Empire, 6th century BCE Parthenon, Athenian Empire Pillar erected by India's Maurya Dynasty Emperor Ashoka Trajan's Column, Rome Terracotta army, China, c. 210 BCE Obelisk of Aksum, Ethiopia There were a number of regional empires during this period. The kingdom of the Medes helped to destroy the Assyrian Empire in tandem with the nomadic Scythians and the Babylonians. Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, was sacked by the Medes in 612 BCE. The Median Empire gave way to successive Iranian empires, including the Achaemenid Empire (550‚Äì330 BCE), the Parthian Empire (247 BCE‚Äì224 CE), and the Sasanian Empire (224‚Äì651 CE). Several empires began in modern-day Greece. First was the Delian League (from 477 BCE) and the succeeding Athenian Empire (454‚Äì404 BCE), centred in present-day Greece. Later, Alexander the Great (356‚Äì323 BCE), of Macedon, founded an empire of conquest, extending from present-day Greece to present-day India. The empire divided shortly after his death, but the influence of his Hellenistic successors made for an extended Hellenistic period (323‚Äì31 BCE) throughout the region. In Asia, the Maurya Empire (322‚Äì185 BCE) existed in present-day India; in the 3rd century BCE, most of South Asia was united to the Maurya Empire by Chandragupta Maurya and flourished under Ashoka the Great. From the 3rd century CE, the Gupta dynasty oversaw the period referred to as ancient India's Golden Age. From the 4th to 6th centuries, northern India was ruled by the Gupta Empire. In southern India, three prominent Dravidian kingdoms emerged: the Cheras, Cholas, and Pandyas. The ensuing stability contributed to heralding in the golden age of Hindu culture in the 4th and 5th centuries. In Europe, the Roman Empire, centered in present-day Italy, began in the 7th century BCE. In the 3rd century BCE the Roman Republic began expanding its territory through conquest and alliances. By the time of Augustus (63 BCE ‚Äì 14 CE), the first Roman Emperor, Rome had already established dominion over most of the Mediterranean. The empire would continue to grow, controlling much of the land from England to Mesopotamia, reaching its greatest extent under the emperor Trajan (died 117 CE). In the 3rd century CE, the empire split into western and eastern regions, with (usually) separate emperors. The Western empire would fall, in 476 CE, to German influence under Odoacer. The eastern empire, now known as the Byzantine Empire, with its capital at Constantinople, would continue for another thousand years, until Constantinople was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1453. In China, the Qin dynasty (221‚Äì206 BCE), the first imperial dynasty of China, was followed by the Han Empire (206 BCE ‚Äì 220 CE). The Han Dynasty was comparable in power and influence to the Roman Empire that lay at the other end of the Silk Road. Han China developed advanced cartography, shipbuilding, and navigation. The Chinese invented blast furnaces, and created finely tuned copper instruments. As with other empires during the Classical Period, Han China advanced significantly in the areas of government, education, mathematics, astronomy, technology, and many others. Maya observatory, Chichen Itza, Mexico In Africa, the Kingdom of Aksum, centred in present-day Ethiopia, established itself by the 1st century CE as a major trading empire, dominating its neighbours in South Arabia and Kush and controlling the Red Sea trade. It minted its own currency and carved enormous monolithic steles such as the Obelisk of Axum to mark their emperors' graves. Successful regional empires were also established in the Americas, arising from cultures established as early as 2500 BCE. In Mesoamerica, vast pre- Columbian societies were built, the most notable being the Zapotec Empire (700 BCE ‚Äì 1521 CE),Zapotec civilization has its beginnings in 700 BCE: see Zapotec civilization ended in 1521 according to the five archaeological stages presented in and the Maya civilization, which reached its highest state of development during the Mesoamerican Classic period (c. 250‚Äì900 CE), but continued throughout the Post-Classic period until the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century CE. Maya civilization arose as the Olmec mother culture gradually declined. The great Mayan city-states slowly rose in number and prominence, and Maya culture spread throughout the Yucat√°n and surrounding areas. The later empire of the Aztecs was built on neighbouring cultures and was influenced by conquered peoples such as the Toltecs. Some areas experienced slow but steady technological advances, with important developments such as the stirrup and moldboard plough arriving every few centuries. There were, however, in some regions, periods of rapid technological progress. Most important, perhaps, was the Hellenistic period in the region of the Mediterranean, during which hundreds of technologies were invented. Such periods were followed by periods of technological decay, as during the Roman Empire's decline and fall and the ensuing early medieval period. Declines, falls, and resurgence The ancient empires faced common problems associated with maintaining huge armies and supporting a central bureaucracy. These costs fell most heavily on the peasantry, while land-owning magnates increasingly evaded centralized control and its costs. Barbarian pressure on the frontiers hastened internal dissolution. China's Han dynasty fell into civil war in 220 CE, beginning the Three Kingdoms period, while its Roman counterpart became increasingly decentralized and divided about the same time in what is known as the Crisis of the Third Century. The great empires of Eurasia were all located on temperate and subtropical coastal plains. From the Central Asian steppes, horse-based nomads, mainly Mongols and Turks, dominated a large part of the continent. The development of the stirrup and the breeding of horses strong enough to carry a fully armed archer made the nomads a constant threat to the more settled civilizations. Pantheon in Rome, Italy, originally a Roman temple, now a Catholic church The gradual break-up of the Roman Empire, spanning several centuries after the 2nd century CE, coincided with the spread of Christianity outward from the Middle East. The Western Roman Empire fell under the domination of Germanic tribes in the 5th century, and these polities gradually developed into a number of warring states, all associated in one way or another with the Catholic Church. The remaining part of the Roman Empire, in the eastern Mediterranean, continued as what came to be called the Byzantine Empire. Centuries later, a limited unity would be restored to western Europe through the establishment in 962 of a revived \\"Roman Empire\\", later called the Holy Roman Empire, comprising a number of states in what is now Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Belgium, Italy, and parts of France. In China, dynasties would rise and fall, but, by sharp contrast to the Mediterranean-European world, dynastic unity would be restored. After the fall of the Eastern Han Dynasty and the demise of the Three Kingdoms, nomadic tribes from the north began to invade in the 4th century, eventually conquering areas of northern China and setting up many small kingdoms. The Sui Dynasty successfully reunified the whole of China in 581, and laid the foundations for a Chinese golden age under the Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907). Post-classical history University of Timbuktu, Mali The term \\"Post-classical Era\\", though derived from the Eurocentric name of the era of \\"Classical antiquity\\", takes in a broader geographic sweep. The era is commonly dated from the 5th-century fall of the Western Roman Empire, which fragmented into many separate kingdoms, some of which would later be confederated under the Holy Roman Empire. The Eastern Roman, or Byzantine, Empire survived until late in the Post-classical, or Medieval, period. The Post-classical period also encompasses the Early Muslim conquests, the subsequent Islamic Golden Age, and the commencement and expansion of the Arab slave trade, followed by the Mongol invasions of the Middle East, Central Asia, and Eastern Europe and the founding around 1280 of the Ottoman Empire. South Asia saw a series of middle kingdoms of India, followed by the establishment of Islamic empires in India. In western Africa, the Mali Empire and the Songhai Empire developed. On the southeast coast of Africa, Arabic ports were established where gold, spices, and other commodities were traded. This allowed Africa to join the Southeast Asia trading system, bringing it contact with Asia; this, along with Muslim culture, resulted in the Swahili culture. China experienced the successive Sui, Tang, Song, Yuan, and early Ming dynasties. Middle Eastern trade routes along the Indian Ocean, and the Silk Road through the Gobi Desert, provided limited economic and cultural contact between Asian and European civilizations. During the same period, civilizations in the Americas, such as the Inca, Maya, and Aztecs, reached their zenith. All would be compromised by, then conquered after, contact with European colonists at the beginning of the Modern period. Greater Middle East Prior to the advent of Islam in the 7th century, the Middle East was dominated by the Byzantine Empire and the Persian Sasanian Empire, which frequently fought each other for control of several disputed regions. This was also a cultural battle, with the Byzantine Hellenistic and Christian culture competing against the Persian Iranian traditions and Zoroastrian religion. The formation of the Islamic religion created a new contender that quickly surpassed both of these empires. Islam greatly affected the political, economic, and military history of the Old World, especially the Middle East. Great Mosque of Kairouan, Tunisia, founded 670 CE From their centre on the Arabian Peninsula, Muslims began their expansion during the early Postclassical Era. By 750 CE, they came to conquer most of the Near East, North Africa, and parts of Europe, ushering in an era of learning, science, and invention known as the Islamic Golden Age. The knowledge and skills of the ancient Near East, Greece, and Persia were preserved in the Postclassical Era by Muslims, who also added new and important innovations from outside, such as the manufacture of paper from China and decimal positional numbering from India. Much of this learning and development can be linked to geography. Even prior to Islam's presence, the city of Mecca had served as a centre of trade in Arabia, and the Islamic prophet Muhammad himself was a merchant. With the new Islamic tradition of the Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca, the city became even more a centre for exchanging goods and ideas. The influence held by Muslim merchants over African-Arabian and Arabian-Asian trade routes was tremendous. As a result, Islamic civilization grew and expanded on the basis of its merchant economy, in contrast to the Europeans, Indians, and Chinese, who based their societies on an agricultural landholding nobility. Merchants brought goods and their Islamic faith to China, India, Southeast Asia, and the kingdoms of western Africa, and returned with new discoveries and inventions. Crusader Krak des Chevaliers, Syria Motivated by religion and dreams of conquest, European leaders launched a number of Crusades to try to roll back Muslim power and retake the Holy Land. The Crusades were ultimately unsuccessful and served more to weaken the Byzantine Empire, especially with the 1204 sack of Constantinople. The Byzantine Empire began to lose increasing amounts of territory to the Ottoman Turks. Arab domination of the region ended in the mid-11th century with the arrival of the Seljuq Turks, migrating south from the Turkic homelands in Central Asia. In the early 13th century, a new wave of invaders, the Mongol Empire, swept through the region but were eventually eclipsed by the Turks and the founding of the Ottoman Empire in modern-day Turkey around 1280. North Africa saw the rise of polities formed by the Berbers, such as the Marinid dynasty in Morocco, the Zayyanid dynasty in Algeria, and the Hafsid dynasty in Tunisia. The region will later be called the Barbary Coast and will host pirates and privateers who will use several North African ports for their raids against the coastal towns of several European countries in search of slaves to be sold in North African markets as part of the Barbary slave trade. Starting with the Sui dynasty (581‚Äì618), the Chinese began expanding into eastern Central Asia, and confronted Turkic nomads, who were becoming the most dominant ethnic group in Central Asia. Originally the relationship was largely cooperative, but in 630 the Tang dynasty began an offensive against the Turks, capturing areas of the Mongolian Ordos Desert. In the 8th century, Islam began to penetrate the region and soon became the sole faith of most of the population, though Buddhism remained strong in the east. The desert nomads of Arabia could militarily match the nomads of the steppe, and the early Arab Empire gained control over parts of Central Asia. The Hephthalites were the most powerful of the nomad groups in the 6th and 7th centuries, and controlled much of the region. In the 9th through 13th centuries the region was divided among several powerful states, including the Samanid Empire the Seljuk Empire, and the Khwarezmid Empire. The largest empire to rise out of Central Asia developed when Genghis Khan united the tribes of Mongolia. The Mongol Empire spread to comprise all of Central Asia and China as well as large parts of Russia and the Middle East. After Genghis Khan died in 1227, most of Central Asia continued to be dominated by a successor state, Chagatai Khanate. In 1369, Timur, a Turkic leader in the Mongol military tradition, conquered most of the region and founded the Timurid Empire. Timur's large empire collapsed soon after his death, however. The region then became divided into a series of smaller khanates that were created by the Uzbeks. These included the Khanate of Khiva, the Khanate of Bukhara, and the Khanate of Kokand, all of whose capitals are located in present-day Uzbekistan. In the aftermath of the Byzantine‚ÄìSasanian wars, the Caucasus saw Armenia and Georgia flourish as independent realms free from foreign suzerainty. However, with the Byzantine and Sasanian empires exhausted from war, the Arabs were given the opportunity to proceed to the Caucasus during the early Muslim conquests. By the 13th century, the arrival of the Mongols saw the region invaded and subjugated once again. Europe Europe during the Early Middle Ages was characterized by depopulation, deurbanization, and barbarian invasion, all of which had begun in Late Antiquity. The barbarian invaders formed their own new kingdoms in the remains of the Western Roman Empire. In the 7th century, North Africa and the Middle East, once part of the Eastern Roman Empire, became part of the Caliphate after conquest by Muhammad's successors. Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures, most of the new kingdoms incorporated as many of the existing Roman institutions as they could. Christianity expanded in western Europe, and monasteries were founded. In the 7th and 8th centuries the Franks, under the Carolingian dynasty, established an empire covering much of western Europe; it lasted until the 9th century, when it succumbed to pressure from new invaders‚Äîthe Vikings, Magyars, and Saracens. St. Peter's Basilica, Vatican City During the High Middle Ages, which began after 1000, the population of Europe increased greatly as technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish and crop yields to increase. Manorialism‚Äîthe organization of peasants into villages that owed rents and labour service to nobles‚Äîand feudalism‚Äîa political structure whereby knights and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords in return for the right to rents from lands and manors‚Äîwere two of the ways of organizing medieval society that developed during the High Middle Ages. Kingdoms became more centralized after the decentralizing effects of the break-up of the Carolingian Empire. The Crusades, first preached in 1095, were an attempt by western Christians from nations such as the Kingdom of England, the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire to regain control of the Holy Land from the Muslims and succeeded for long enough to establish some Christian states in the Near East. Italian merchants imported slaves to work in households or in sugar processing. Intellectual life was marked by scholasticism and the founding of universities, while the building of Gothic cathedrals was one of the outstanding artistic achievements of the age. The Late Middle Ages were marked by difficulties and calamities. Famine, plague, and war devastated the population of western Europe. The Black Death alone killed approximately 75 to 200 million people between 1347 and 1350. It was one of the deadliest pandemics in human history. Starting in Asia, the disease reached Mediterranean and western Europe during the late 1340s, and killed tens of millions of Europeans in six years; between a third and a half of the population perished. The Middle Ages witnessed the first sustained urbanization of northern and western Europe and it lasted until the beginning of the early modern period in the 16th century, marked by the rise of nation states, the division of Western Christianity in the Reformation, the rise of humanism in the Italian Renaissance, and the beginnings of European overseas expansion which allowed for the Columbian Exchange. In Central and Eastern Europe, in 1386, the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (the latter including territories of modern Belarus and Ukraine), facing depredations by the Teutonic Knights and later also threats from Muscovy, the Crimean Tatars, and the Ottoman Empire, formed a personal union through the marriage of Poland's Queen Jadwiga to Lithuanian Grand Duke Jogaila, who became King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço of Poland. For the next four centuries, until the 18th-century Partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth by Prussia, Russia, and Austria, the two polities conducted a federated condominium, long Europe's largest state, which welcomed diverse ethnicities and religions, including most of the world's Jews, furthered scientific thought (e.g., Copernicus's heliocentric theory), and‚Äîin a last-ditch effort to preserve their sovereignty‚Äîadopted the Constitution of 3 May 1791, the world's second modern written constitution after the U.S. Constitution that went into effect in 1789. Sub-Saharan Africa Brass \\"Benin bronze\\", Nigeria Medieval Sub-Saharan Africa was home to many different civilizations. The Kingdom of Aksum declined in the 7th century as Islam cut it off from its Christian allies and its people moved further into the Ethiopian Highlands for protection. They eventually gave way to the Zagwe dynasty who are famed for their rock cut architecture at Lalibela. The Zagwe would then fall to the Solomonic dynasty who claimed descent from the Aksumite emperors and would rule the country well into the 20th century. In the West African Sahel region, many Islamic empires rose, such as the Ghana Empire, the Mali Empire, the Songhai Empire, and the Kanem‚ÄìBornu Empire. They controlled the trans-Saharan trade in gold, ivory, salt and slaves. South of the Sahel, civilizations rose in the coastal forests where horses and camels could not survive. These include the Yoruba city of Ife, noted for its art, and the Oyo Empire, the Kingdom of Benin of the Edo people centred in Benin City, the Igbo Kingdom of Nri which produced advanced bronze art at Igbo-Ukwu, and the Akan who are noted for their intricate architecture. Central Africa saw the birth of several states, including the Kingdom of Kongo. In what is now modern Southern Africa, native Africans created various kingdoms such as the Kingdom of Mutapa. They flourished through trade with the Swahili people on the East African coast. They built large defensive stone structures without mortar such as Great Zimbabwe, capital of the Kingdom of Zimbabwe, Khami, capital of Kingdom of Butua, and Danangombe (Dhlo-Dhlo), capital of the Rozwi Empire. The Swahili people themselves were the inhabitants of the East African coast from Kenya to Mozambique who traded extensively with Asians and Arabs, who introduced them to Islam. They built many port cities such as Mombasa, Zanzibar and Kilwa, which were known to Chinese sailors under Zheng He and Islamic geographers. South Asia Chennakesava Temple, Belur, India In northern India, after the fall (550 CE) of the Gupta Empire, the region was divided into a complex and fluid network of smaller kingly states. Early Muslim incursions began in the west in 712 CE, when the Arab Umayyad Caliphate annexed much of present-day Pakistan. Arab military advance was largely halted at that point, but Islam still spread in India, largely due to the influence of Arab merchants along the western coast. The ninth century saw a Tripartite Struggle for control of northern India, among the Pratihara Empire, the Pala Empire, and the Rashtrakuta Empire. Some of the important states that emerged in India at this time included the Bahmani Sultanate and the Vijayanagara Empire. Post-classical dynasties in South India included those of the Chalukyas, the Hoysalas, the Cholas, the Islamic Mughals, the Marathas, and the Mysores. Science, engineering, art, literature, astronomy, and philosophy flourished under the patronage of these kings. Northeast Asia After a period of relative disunity, China was reunified by the Sui dynasty in 581 and under the succeeding Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907) China entered a Golden Age. The Tang Empire competed with the Tibetan Empire for control of areas in Inner and Central Asia. The Tang dynasty eventually splintered, however, and after half a century of turmoil the Song dynasty reunified China, when it was, according to William McNeill, the \\"richest, most skilled, and most populous country on earth\\". Pressure from nomadic empires to the north became increasingly urgent. By 1142, North China had been lost to the Jurchens in the Jin‚ÄìSong Wars, and the Mongol Empire conquered all of China in 1279, along with almost half of Eurasia's landmass. After about a century of Mongol Yuan dynasty rule, the ethnic Chinese reasserted control with the founding of the Ming dynasty (1368). 1281 Mongol invasion of Japan In Japan, the imperial lineage had been established by this time, and during the Asuka period (538‚Äì710) the Yamato Province developed into a clearly centralized state. Buddhism was introduced, and there was an emphasis on the adoption of elements of Chinese culture and Confucianism. The Nara period of the 8th century marked the emergence of a strong Japanese state and is often portrayed as a golden age. During this period, the imperial government undertook great public works, including government offices, temples, roads, and irrigation systems. The Heian period (794 to 1185) saw the peak of imperial power, followed by the rise of militarized clans, and the beginning of Japanese feudalism. The feudal period of Japanese history, dominated by powerful regional lords (daimy≈çs) and the military rule of warlords (sh≈çguns) such as the Ashikaga shogunate and Tokugawa shogunate, stretched from 1185 to 1868. The emperor remained, but mostly as a figurehead, and the power of merchants was weak. Postclassical Korea saw the end of the Three Kingdoms era, the three kingdoms being Goguryeo, Baekje and Silla. Silla conquered Baekje in 660, and Goguryeo in 668, marking the beginning of the North‚ÄìSouth States Period (ÎÇ®Î∂ÅÍµ≠ÏãúÎåÄ), with Unified Silla in the south and Balhae, a successor state to Goguryeo, in the north. In 892 CE, this arrangement reverted to the Later Three Kingdoms, with Goguryeo (then called Taebong and eventually named Goryeo) emerging as dominant, unifying the entire peninsula by 936. The founding Goryeo dynasty ruled until 1392, succeeded by the Joseon dynasty, which ruled for approximately 500 years. Southeast Asia Angkor Wat temple, Cambodia, early 12th century The beginning of the Middle Ages in Southeast Asia saw the fall (550 CE) of the Kingdom of Funan to the Chenla Empire, which was then replaced by the Khmer Empire (802 CE). The Khmer people's capital city, Angkor, was the largest city in the world prior to the industrial age and contained over a thousand temples, the most famous being Angkor Wat. The Sukhothai (1238 CE) and Ayutthaya (1351 CE) kingdoms were major powers of the Thai people, who were influenced by the Khmer. Starting in the 9th century, the Pagan Kingdom rose to prominence in modern Myanmar. Its collapse brought about political fragmention that ended with the rise of the Toungoo Empire in the 16th century. Other notable kingdoms of the period include the Srivijayan Empire and the Lavo Kingdom (both coming into prominence in the 7th century), the Champa and the Hariphunchai (both about 750), the ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát (968), Lan Na (13th century), Majapahit (1293), Lan Xang (1354), and the Kingdom of Ava (1364). This period saw the spread of Islam to present-day Indonesia (beginning in the 13th century) and the emergence of the Malay states, including the Malacca Sultanate and the Bruneian Empire. In the Philippines, several polities arose during this period, including the Rajahnate of Maynila, the Rajahnate of Cebu, the Rajahnate of Butuan. Oceania Moai, Rapa Nui (Easter Island) In the region of Oceania, the Tu ªi Tonga Empire was founded in the 10th century CE and expanded between 1200 and 1500. Tongan culture, language, and hegemony spread widely throughout Eastern Melanesia, Micronesia, and Central Polynesia during this period, influencing East 'Uvea, Rotuma, Futuna, Samoa, and Niue, as well as specific islands and parts of Micronesia (Kiribati, Pohnpei, and miscellaneous outliers), Vanuatu, and New Caledonia (specifically, the Loyalty Islands, with the main island being predominantly populated by the Melanesian Kanak people and their cultures). At around the same time, a powerful thalassocracy appeared in Eastern Polynesia, centered around the Society Islands, specifically on the sacred Taputapuatea marae, which drew in Eastern Polynesian colonists from places as far away as Hawaii, New Zealand (Aotearoa), and the Tuamotu Islands for political, spiritual and economic reasons, until the unexplained collapse of regular long-distance voyaging in the Eastern Pacific a few centuries before Europeans began exploring the area. Indigenous written records from this period are virtually nonexistent, as it seems that all Pacific Islanders, with the possible exception of the enigmatic Rapa Nui and their currently undecipherable Rongorongo script, had no writing systems of any kind until after their introduction by European colonists. However, some indigenous prehistories can be estimated and academically reconstructed through careful, judicious analysis of native oral traditions, colonial ethnography, archeology, physical anthropology, and linguistics research. Americas Machu Picchu, Inca Empire, Peru In North America, this period saw the rise of the Mississippian culture in the modern-day United States c. 800 CE, marked by the extensive 12th-century urban complex at Cahokia. The Ancestral Puebloans and their predecessors (9th ‚Äì 13th centuries) built extensive permanent settlements, including stone structures that would remain the largest buildings in North America until the 19th century. In Mesoamerica, the Teotihuacan civilization fell and the Classic Maya collapse occurred. The Aztec Empire came to dominate much of Mesoamerica in the 14th and 15th centuries. In South America, the 14th and 15th centuries saw the rise of the Inca. The Inca Empire of Tawantinsuyu, with its capital at Cusco, spanned the entire Andes, making it the most extensive pre-Columbian civilization. The Inca were prosperous and advanced, known for an excellent road system and unrivaled masonry. Modern history Gutenberg Bible, ca. 1450, produced using movable type In the linear, global, historiographical approach, modern history (the \\"modern period,\\" the \\"modern era,\\" \\"modern times\\") is the history of the period following post-classical history (in Europe known as the \\"Middle Ages\\"), spanning from about 1500 to the present. \\"Contemporary history\\" includes events from around 1945 to the present. (The definitions of both terms, \\"modern history\\" and \\"contemporary history\\", have changed over time, as more history has occurred, and so have their start dates.)Intrinsic to the English language, \\"modern\\" denotes (in reference to history) a period that is opposed to either ancient or medieval; modern history is the history of the world since the end of the Middle Ages. Modern history can be further broken down into periods: * The early modern period began around 1500 and ended around 1815. Notable historical milestones included the continued European Renaissance (whose start is dated variously between 1200 and 1401), the Age of Exploration, the Islamic gunpowder empires, the Protestant Reformation, and the American Revolution. With the Scientific Revolution, new information about the world was discovered via empirical observationBaird, F.E., & Kaufmann, W.A. (2008). Philosophic classics: From Plato to Derrida. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson/Prentice Hall. and the scientific method, by contrast with the earlier emphasis on reason and \\"innate knowledge\\". The Scientific Revolution received impetus from Johannes Gutenberg's introduction to Europe of printing, using movable type, and from the invention of the telescope and microscope. Globalization was fuelled by international trade and colonization. * The late modern period began sometime around 1750‚Äì1815, as Europe experienced the Industrial Revolution and the military-political turbulence of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, which were followed by the Pax Britannica. The late modern period continues either to the end of World War II, in 1945, or to the present. Other notable historical milestones included the Great Divergence and the Russian Revolution. * Contemporary history (a period also dubbed Pax Americana in geopolitics) includes historic events from approximately 1945 that are closely relevant to the present time. Major developments include the Cold War, continual hot wars and proxy wars, the Jet Age, the DNA revolution, the Green Revolution, artificial satellites and global positioning systems (GPS), development of the supranational European Union, the Information Age, rapid economic development in India and China, increasing terrorism, and a daunting array of global ecological crises headed by the imminent existential threat of runaway global warming. The defining features of the modern era developed predominantly in Europe, and so different periodizations are sometimes applied to other parts of the world. When the European periods are used globally, this is often in the context of contact with European culture in the Age of Discovery. In the humanities and social sciences, the norms, attitudes, and practices arising during the modern period are known as modernity. The corresponding terms for post-World War II culture are postmodernity or late modernity. Early modern period The \\"Early Modern period\\" was the period between the Middle Ages and the Industrial Revolution‚Äîroughly 1500 to 1800. The Early Modern period was characterized by the rise of science, and by increasingly rapid technological progress, secularized civic politics, and the nation state. Capitalist economies began their rise, initially in northern Italian republics such as Genoa. The Early Modern period saw the rise and dominance of mercantilist economic theory, and the decline and eventual disappearance, in much of the European sphere, of feudalism, serfdom, and the power of the Catholic Church. The period included the Protestant Reformation, the disastrous Thirty Years' War, the Age of Exploration, European colonial expansion, the peak of European witch-hunting, the Scientific Revolution, and the Age of Enlightenment. =Renaissance= Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man (c. 1490), Renaissance Italy Europe's Renaissance ‚Äì the \\"rebirth\\" of classical culture, beginning in the 14th century and extending into the 16th ‚Äì comprised the rediscovery of the classical world's cultural, scientific, and technological achievements, and the economic and social rise of Europe. The Renaissance engendered a culture of inquisitiveness which ultimately led to Humanism and the Scientific Revolution. This period, which saw social and political upheavals, and revolutions in many intellectual pursuits, is also celebrated for its artistic developments and the attainments of such polymaths as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, who inspired the term \\"Renaissance man.\\" =European expansion= During this period, European powers came to dominate most of the world. Although the most developed regions of European classical civilization were more urbanized than any other region of the world, European civilization had undergone a lengthy period of gradual decline and collapse. During the Early Modern Period, Europe was able to regain its dominance; historians still debate the causes. Europe's success in this period stands in contrast to other regions. For example, one of the most advanced civilizations of the Middle Ages was China. It had developed an advanced monetary economy by 1000 CE. China had a free peasantry who were no longer subsistence farmers, and could sell their produce and actively participate in the market. According to Adam Smith, writing in the 18th century, China had long been one of the richest, most fertile, best cultivated, most industrious, most urbanized, and most prosperous countries in the world. It enjoyed a technological advantage and had a monopoly in cast iron production, piston bellows, suspension bridge construction, printing, and the compass. However, it seemed to have long since stopped progressing. Marco Polo, who visited China in the 13th century, describes its cultivation, industry, and populousness almost in the same terms as travellers would in the 18th century. One theory of Europe's rise holds that Europe's geography played an important role in its success. The Middle East, India and China are all ringed by mountains and oceans but, once past these outer barriers, are nearly flat. By contrast, the Pyrenees, Alps, Apennines, Carpathians and other mountain ranges run through Europe, and the continent is also divided by several seas. This gave Europe some degree of protection from the peril of Central Asian invaders. Before the era of firearms, these nomads were militarily superior to the agricultural states on the periphery of the Eurasian continent and, as they broke out into the plains of northern India or the valleys of China, were all but unstoppable. These invasions were often devastating. The Golden Age of Islam was ended by the Mongol sack of Baghdad in 1258. India and China were subject to periodic invasions, and Russia spent a couple of centuries under the Mongol-Tatar yoke. Central and western Europe, logistically more distant from the Central Asian heartland, proved less vulnerable to these threats. Geography contributed to important geopolitical differences. For most of their histories, China, India, and the Middle East were each unified under a single dominant power that expanded until it reached the surrounding mountains and deserts. In 1600 the Ottoman Empire controlled almost all the Middle East, the Ming dynasty ruled China, and the Mughal Empire held sway over India. By contrast, Europe was almost always divided into a number of warring states. Pan-European empires, with the notable exception of the Roman Empire, tended to collapse soon after they arose. Another doubtless important geographic factor in the rise of Europe was the Mediterranean Sea, which, for millennia, had functioned as a maritime superhighway fostering the exchange of goods, people, ideas and inventions. Nearly all the agricultural civilizations have been heavily constrained by their environments. Productivity remained low, and climatic changes easily instigated boom-and-bust cycles that brought about civilizations' rise and fall. By about 1500, however, there was a qualitative change in world history. Technological advance and the wealth generated by trade gradually brought about a widening of possibilities.(see see here - (self promotion?)) 1570 world map, showing Europeans' discoveries Many have also argued that Europe's institutions allowed it to expand, that property rights and free-market economics were stronger than elsewhere due to an ideal of freedom peculiar to Europe. In recent years, however, scholars such as Kenneth Pomeranz have challenged this view. Europe's maritime expansion unsurprisingly‚Äîgiven the continent's geography‚Äîwas largely the work of its Atlantic states: Portugal, Spain, England, France, and the Netherlands. Initially the Portuguese and Spanish Empires were the predominant conquerors and sources of influence, and their union resulted in the Iberian Union, the first global empire on which the \\"sun never set\\". Soon the more northern English, French and Dutch began to dominate the Atlantic. In a series of wars fought in the 17th and 18th centuries, culminating with the Napoleonic Wars, Britain emerged as the new world power. =Regional developments= Hagia Sophia, Istanbul (formerly Constantinople), Turkey Persia came under the rule of the Safavid Empire in 1501, succeeded by the Afsharid Empire in 1736, the Zand Empire in 1751, and the Qajar Empire in 1794. Areas to the north and east in Central Asia were held by Uzbeks and Pashtuns. The Ottoman Empire, after taking Constantinople in 1453, quickly gained control of the Middle East, the Balkans, and most of North Africa. In Africa, this period saw a decline in many civilizations and an advancement in others. The Swahili Coast declined after coming under the Portuguese Empire and later the Omani Empire. In West Africa, the Songhai Empire fell to the Moroccans in 1591 when they invaded with guns.The Bono State which gave birth to numerous Akan states in search of gold such as Akwamu, Akyem, Fante, Adanse etc. The South African Kingdom of Zimbabwe gave way to smaller kingdoms such as Mutapa, Butua, and Rozvi. Ethiopia suffered from the 1531 invasion from neighbouring Muslim Adal Sultanate, and in 1769 entered the Zemene Mesafint (Age of Princes) during which the Emperor became a figurehead and the country was ruled by warlords, though the royal line later would recover under Emperor Tewodros II. The Ajuran Sultanate, in the Horn of Africa, began to decline in the 17th century, succeeded by the Geledi Sultanate. Other civilizations in Africa advanced during this period. The Oyo Empire experienced its golden age, as did the Kingdom of Benin. The Ashanti Empire rose to power in what is modern day Ghana in 1670. The Kingdom of Kongo also thrived during this period. Ming Dynasty section, Great Wall of China In China, the Ming gave way in 1644 to the Qing, the last Chinese imperial dynasty, which would rule until 1912. Japan experienced its Azuchi‚ÄìMomoyama period (1568‚Äì1603), followed by the Edo period (1603‚Äì1868). The Korean Joseon dynasty (1392‚Äì1910) ruled throughout this period, successfully repelling 16th- and 17th-century invasions from Japan and China. Japan and China were significantly affected during this period by expanded maritime trade with Europe, particularly the Portuguese in Japan. During the Edo period, Japan would pursue isolationist policies, to eliminate foreign influences. Taj Mahal, Mughal Empire, India On the Indian subcontinent, the Delhi Sultanate and the Deccan sultanates would give way, beginning in the 16th century, to the Mughal Empire. Starting in the northwest, the Mughal Empire would by the late 17th century come to rule the entire subcontinent, except for the southernmost Indian provinces, which would remain independent. Against the Muslim Mughal Empire, the Hindu Maratha Empire was founded on the west coast in 1674, gradually gaining territory‚Äîa majority of present-day India‚Äîfrom the Mughals over several decades, particularly in the Mughal‚ÄìMaratha Wars (1681‚Äì1701). The Maratha Empire would in 1818 fall under the control of the British East India Company, with all former Maratha and Mughal authority devolving in 1858 to the British Raj. In 1511 the Portuguese overthrew the Malacca Sultanate in present-day Malaysia and Indonesian Sumatra. The Portuguese held this important trading territory (and the valuable associated navigational strait) until overthrown by the Dutch in 1641. The Johor Sultanate, centred on the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, became the dominant trading power in the region. European colonization expanded with the Dutch in the Netherlands East Indies, the Portuguese in East Timor, and the Spanish in the Philippines. Into the 19th century, European expansion would affect the whole of Southeast Asia, with the British in Myanmar and Malaysia and the French in Indochina. Only Thailand would successfully resist colonization. The Pacific islands of Oceania would also be affected by European contact, starting with the circumnavigational voyage of Ferdinand Magellan, who landed on the Marianas and other islands in 1521. Also notable were the voyages (1642‚Äì44) of Abel Tasman to present-day Australia, New Zealand and nearby islands, and the voyages (1768‚Äì1779) of Captain James Cook, who made the first recorded European contact with Hawaii. Britain would found its first colony on Australia in 1788. In the Americas, the western European powers vigorously colonized the newly discovered continents, largely displacing the indigenous populations, and destroying the advanced civilizations of the Aztecs and the Incas. Spain, Portugal, Britain, and France all made extensive territorial claims, and undertook large-scale settlement, including the importation of large numbers of African slaves. Portugal claimed Brazil. Spain claimed the rest of South America, Mesoamerica, and southern North America. Britain colonized the east coast of North America, and France colonized the central region of North America. Russia made incursions onto the northwest coast of North America, with a first colony in present-day Alaska in 1784, and the outpost of Fort Ross in present-day California in 1812. In 1762, in the midst of the Seven Years' War, France secretly ceded most of its North American claims to Spain in the Treaty of Fontainebleau. Thirteen of the British colonies declared independence as the United States of America in 1776, ratified by the Treaty of Paris in 1783, ending the American Revolutionary War. Napoleon Bonaparte won France's claims back from Spain in the Napoleonic Wars in 1800, but sold them to the United States in 1803 as the Louisiana Purchase. In Russia, Ivan the Terrible was crowned in 1547 as the first Tsar of Russia, and by annexing the Turkic khanates in the east, transformed Russia into a regional power. The countries of western Europe, while expanding prodigiously through technological advancement and colonial conquest, competed with each other economically and militarily in a state of almost constant war. Often the wars had a religious dimension, either Catholic versus Protestant, or (primarily in eastern Europe) Christian versus Muslim. Wars of particular note include the Thirty Years' War, the War of the Spanish Succession, the Seven Years' War, and the French Revolutionary Wars. Napoleon came to power in France in 1799, an event foreshadowing the Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th century. Late modern period1750‚Äì1914= Watt's steam engine powered the Industrial Revolution. The Scientific Revolution changed humanity's understanding of the world and led to the Industrial Revolution, a major transformation of the world's economies. The Scientific Revolution in the 17th century had had little immediate effect on industrial technology; only in the second half of the 18th century did scientific advances begin to be applied substantially to practical invention. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and used new modes of production‚Äîthe factory, mass production, and mechanization‚Äîto manufacture a wide array of goods faster and using less labour than previously required. The Age of Enlightenment also led to the beginnings of modern democracy in the late-18th century American and French Revolutions. Democracy and republicanism would grow to have a profound effect on world events and on quality of life. Empires, 1898 The Wright Brothers built and flew the first airplane, the Wright Flyer, in 1903 After Europeans had achieved influence and control over the Americas, imperial activities turned to the lands of Asia and Oceania. In the 19th century the European states had social and technological advantage over Eastern lands. Britain gained control of the Indian subcontinent, Egypt and the Malay Peninsula; the French took Indochina; while the Dutch cemented their control over the Dutch East Indies. The British also colonized Australia, New Zealand and South Africa with large numbers of British colonists emigrating to these colonies. Russia colonized large pre- agricultural areas of Siberia. In the late 19th century, the European powers divided the remaining areas of Africa. Within Europe, economic and military challenges created a system of nation states, and ethno-linguistic groupings began to identify themselves as distinctive nations with aspirations for cultural and political autonomy. This nationalism would become important to peoples across the world in the 20th century. During the Second Industrial Revolution, the world economy became reliant on coal as a fuel, as new methods of transport, such as railways and steamships, effectively shrank the world. Meanwhile, industrial pollution and environmental damage, present since the discovery of fire and the beginning of civilization, accelerated drastically. The advantages that Europe had developed by the mid-18th century were two: an entrepreneurial culture, and the wealth generated by the Atlantic trade (including the African slave trade). By the late 16th century, silver from the Americas accounted for the Spanish empire's wealth. The profits of the slave trade and of West Indian plantations amounted to 5% of the British economy at the time of the Industrial Revolution. While some historians conclude that, in 1750, labour productivity in the most developed regions of China was still on a par with that of Europe's Atlantic economy,see the NBER Publications by Carol H. Shiue and Wolfgang Keller at nber.org other historians such as Angus Maddison hold that the per-capita productivity of western Europe had by the late Middle Ages surpassed that of all other regions. =1914‚Äì1945= World War I trench warfare The 20th century opened with Europe at an apex of wealth and power, and with much of the world under its direct colonial control or its indirect domination. Much of the rest of the world was influenced by heavily Europeanized nations: the United States and Japan. As the century unfolded, however, the global system dominated by rival powers was subjected to severe strains, and ultimately yielded to a more fluid structure of independent nations organized on Western models. This transformation was catalyzed by wars of unparalleled scope and devastation. World War I led to the collapse of four empires ‚Äì Austria-Hungary, the German Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the Russian Empire ‚Äì and weakened Great Britain and France. In the war's aftermath, powerful ideologies rose to prominence. The Russian Revolution of 1917 created the first communist state, while the 1920s and 1930s saw militaristic fascist dictatorships gain control in Italy, Germany, Spain, and elsewhere. Atomic bombings: Hiroshima, Nagasaki, 1945 Ongoing national rivalries, exacerbated by the economic turmoil of the Great Depression, helped precipitate World War II. The militaristic dictatorships of Europe and Japan pursued an ultimately doomed course of imperialist expansionism, in the course of which Nazi Germany orchestrated the murder of six million Jews in the Holocaust, while Imperial Japan murdered millions of Chinese. The World War II defeat of the Axis Powers opened the way for the advance of communism into Central Europe, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, China, North Vietnam, and North Korea. Contemporary history1945‚Äì2000= M·ªπ Lai, Vi·ªát Nam, 1968) suffered greatly in 20th-century wars. When World War II ended in 1945, the United Nations was founded in the hope of preventing future wars, as the League of Nations had been formed following World War I. The war had left two countries, the United States and the Soviet Union, with principal power to influence international affairs. Each was suspicious of the other and feared a global spread of the other's, respectively capitalist and communist, political-economic model. This led to the Cold War, a forty-five-year stand- off and arms race between the United States and its allies, on one hand, and the Soviet Union and its allies on the other.Graham Allison, \\"The Myth of the Liberal Order: From Historical Accident to Conventional Wisdom\\", Foreign Affairs, vol. 97, no. 4 (July‚ÄìAugust 2018), p. 126. With the development of nuclear weapons during World War II, and with their subsequent proliferation, all of humanity were put at risk of nuclear war between the two superpowers, as demonstrated by many incidents, most prominently the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Such war being viewed as impractical, the superpowers instead waged proxy wars in non-nuclear-armed Third World countries.Graham Allison, \\"The Myth of the Liberal Order: From Historical Accident to Conventional Wisdom\\", Foreign Affairs, vol. 97, no. 4 (July‚ÄìAugust 2018), pp. 127‚Äì28. In China, Mao Zedong implemented industrialization and collectivization reforms as part of the Great Leap Forward (1958‚Äì1962), leading to the starvation deaths (1959‚Äì1961) of tens of millions of people. Between 1969 and 1972, as part of the Cold War space race, twelve men landed on the Moon and safely returned to Earth. The Cold War ended in 1991, when the Soviet Union disintegrated, in part due to inability to compete economically with the United States and western Europe. However, the United States likewise began to show signs of slippage in its geopolitical influence, even as its private sector, now less inhibited by the claims of the public sector, increasingly sought private advantage to the prejudice of the public weal. In the early postwar decades, the colonies in Asia and Africa of the Belgian, British, Dutch, French, and other west European empires won their formal independence. However, these newly independent countries often faced challenges in the form of neocolonialism, sociopolitical disarray, poverty, illiteracy, and endemic tropical diseases. Most Western European and Central European countries gradually formed a political and economic community, the European Union, which expanded eastward to include former Soviet-satellite countries. The European Union's effectiveness was handicapped by the immaturity of its common economic and political institutions, somewhat comparable to the inadequacy of United States institutions under the Articles of Confederation prior to the adoption of the U.S. Constitution that came into force in 1789. Asian, African, and South American countries followed suit and began taking tentative steps toward forming their own respective continental associations. Last Moon landing: Apollo 17 (1972) Cold War preparations to deter or to fight a third world war accelerated advances in technologies that, though conceptualized before World War II, had been implemented for that war's exigencies, such as jet aircraft, rocketry, and electronic computers. In the decades after World War II, these advances led to jet travel, artificial satellites with innumerable applications including global positioning systems (GPS), and the Internet‚Äîinventions that have revolutionized the movement of people, ideas, and information. However, not all scientific and technological advances in the second half of the 20th century required an initial military impetus. That period also saw ground-breaking developments such as the discovery of the structure of DNA, the consequent sequencing of the human genome, the worldwide eradication of smallpox, the discovery of plate tectonics, manned and unmanned exploration of space and of previously inaccessible parts of Earth, and foundational discoveries in physics phenomena ranging from the smallest entities (particle physics) to the greatest entity (physical cosmology). =21st century= The 21st century has been marked by growing economic globalization and integration, with consequent increased risk to interlinked economies, as exemplified by the Great Recession of the late 2000s and early 2010s.Bob Davis, \\"What's a Global Recession?\\", The Wall Street Journal, 22 April 2009. Retrieved 2 January 2019. This period has also seen the expansion of communications with mobile phones and the Internet, which have caused fundamental societal changes in business, politics, and individuals' personal lives. Worldwide competition for resources has risen due to growing populations and industrialization, especially in India, China, and Brazil. The increased demands are contributing to increased environmental degradation and to global warming. China has urbanized rapidly in the 21st century (Shanghai pictured). International tensions were heightened in connection with the efforts of some nuclear-armed states to induce North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, and to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.Wendy R. Sherman, \\"How We Got the Iran Deal: And Why We'll Miss It\\", Foreign Affairs, vol. 97, no. 5 (September / October 2018), pp. 186‚Äì97. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic became the first pandemic in the 21st century to substantially disrupt global trading and cause recessions in the global economy.

During Bill Clinton's first term as president, Christopher served as the 63rd Secretary of State. Born in Scranton, North Dakota, Christopher clerked for Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas after graduating from Stanford Law School. He became a partner in the firm of O'Melveny & Myers and served as Deputy Attorney General from 1967 to 1969 under President Lyndon B. Johnson. He served as Deputy Secretary of State under President Jimmy Carter, holding that position from 1977 to 1981. In 1991, he chaired the Christopher Commission, which investigated the Los Angeles Police Department in the wake of the Rodney King incident. During the 1992 presidential election, Christopher headed Bill Clinton's search for a running mate, and Clinton chose Senator Al Gore. After Clinton won the 1992 election, Christopher led the Clinton administration's transition process, and he took office as Secretary of State in 1993. As Secretary of State, Christopher sought to expand NATO, broker peace in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, and pressure China regarding its human rights practices. He also helped negotiate the Dayton Agreement, which ended the Bosnian War. He left office in 1997, and was succeeded by Madeleine Albright.

Secretary of State for Clinton Serving as Secretary of State from January 20, 1993 until January 17, 1997, Christopher's main goals were expanding NATO, establishing peace between Israel and its neighbors, and using economic pressure to force China's hand on human rights practices. The major events transpiring during his tenure included the Oslo Accords, the Dayton Agreement, normalization of United States‚ÄìVietnam relations, the Rwandan genocide, Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti, and the Khobar Towers bombing. Assassination attempt on George H. W. Bush, April 1993 On April 13, 1993, eleven Iraqi intelligence agents smuggled a car bomb into Kuwait in an attempt to assassinate former President George H. W. Bush as he spoke at Kuwait University. Secretary Christopher, among others, urged President Clinton to make a retaliatory strike against Iraq.Christopher, Chances of a Lifetime. (2001). Page 234. On June 26, 1993, the United States launched 23 Tomahawk missiles against the Baghdad intelligence headquarters. Oslo Accords, September 1993 In August 1993, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators meeting in Norway drew up the Oslo Accords, which created the Palestinian Authority in exchange for Palestinian recognition of Israel's right to exist. Secretary Christopher accepted Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres's offer to host the signing ceremony. The ceremony took place in Washington D.C. on 13 September 1993, with Mahmoud Abbas signing for the Palestine Liberation Organization, Peres signing for the State of Israel, Secretary Christopher signing for the United States and Andrei Kozyrev signing for Russia, in the presence of President Clinton.Christopher, Warren. Chances of a Lifetime. (New York: Scribner Press, 2001) p. 200. Christopher was one of the main visionaries and proponent of an integrated Middle East. Partnership for Peace NATO expansion, January 1994 In order to initiate further enlargement of NATO with minimal backlash from Russia, Secretary Christopher promoted the Partnership for Peace program as a stepping-stone into full NATO membership. This was against protests from the Pentagon. Rwandan Genocide, 1994 In what is recognized as the terrible failure of the international community, the US and UN failed to intervene to stop the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Over the course of a hundred days, some 800,000 Tutsis were massacred by Hutu militia.Manry, Bill Clinton pp 127-29. \\"A Problem from Hell\\": America and the Age of Genocide (2002) by Samantha Power, pp 329-90. online China: Delinking human rights and trade status, May 1994 During the 1992 presidential campaign, then-candidate Clinton blasted President George H. W. Bush for giving China low-tariff trading privileges despite its human rights abuses. Secretary Christopher agreed with this view and believed that the US should use economic pressure to force China to improve its human rights record. However, on May 26, 1994, President Clinton renewed China's low-tariff trading privileges, effectively delinking the human rights issue from China's trade relations with the US. U.S.-Sino relations improved as a result, with President Jiang Zemin visiting the U.S. in November 1997 and President Clinton visiting China in June 1998.Christopher, Chances of a Lifetime. p. 242. Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti, September 1994 On September 19, 1994, a US-led coalition returned Haiti's popularly elected President Jean- Bertrande Aristide to power after a coup had unseated him. The US military effort, known as Operation Uphold Democracy, was largely the product of Colin Powell's diplomatic efforts, with little role played by Christopher.Christopher, Chances of a Lifetime. (2001) p. 192. Israel- Jordan peace treaty, October 1994 In the wake of the 1993 Oslo Accords, Secretary Christopher encouraged Jordan's King Hussein to make a peace treaty with Israel. Christopher eventually offered Hussein $200 million in military equipment and $700 million in debt forgiveness to sweeten the deal. On October 27, 1994, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzchak Rabin and Jordanian Prime Minister Abdelsalam al-Majali signed the Israel‚ÄìJordan peace treaty. The signing was witnessed by President Clinton and Secretary Christopher. Christopher sought to obtain a similar treaty between Rabin and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, but to no avail.Christopher, Chances of a Lifetime. (2001) p. 214. Vietnam: Normalizing relations, July 1995 Working with Senator John McCain, in 1994, Secretary Christopher began actively promoting the normalization of United States‚ÄìVietnam relations. At the time, the U.S. had not had an embassy in Vietnam since 1975. The main obstacle to normalization came from veterans and POW/MIA support groups who were convinced that Hanoi was not fully cooperating in the search for the remains of US soldiers in Vietnam. However, after Secretary Christopher convinced President Clinton that the Vietnamese government was fully cooperating in these searches, the President announced the formal normalization of diplomatic relations with Vietnam on July 11, 1995.Christopher, Chances of a Lifetime. (2001) p. 293. Dayton Agreement, November 1995 In Dayton, Ohio, Secretary Christopher‚Äîworking with Assistant Secretary Richard Holbrooke‚Äînegotiated peace talks between President of Serbia Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, President of Croatia Franjo Tuƒëman, and President of Bosnia Alija Izetbegoviƒá. The result was the November 1995 Dayton Agreement, which put an end to the Bosnian War.Christopher, Chances of a Lifetime. (2001) p. 251 Khobar Towers bombing, June 1996 In the wake of the Khobar Towers bombing, Secretary Christopher traveled to Saudi Arabia to witness the site of the attack. In Dhahran (the home of the Khobar Towers), Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal allegedly promised Christopher that the FBI would have the full cooperation of the Saudi government. Eventually, however, the Saudi government and the FBI repeatedly conflicted during the course of the investigation.Christopher, Chances of a Lifetime. (2001) p. 225.

Garfield Baller Award; the Thomas Jefferson Award in Law from the University of Virginia Law School; and the Louis Stein Award from Fordham Law School. Christopher's picture hangs in the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City, near pictures of John Kerry, Robert McNamara, Elmo Zumwalt, and other American dignitaries, in commemoration of his visit to Vietnam, after normalization of relations between the two countries. At the 1999 unveiling of his portrait at the Department of State, attended by President Clinton, Christopher remarked: \\"To anyone who has served in Washington, there is something oddly familiar about [having your portrait painted]. First, you're painted into a corner, then you're hung out to dry and, finally, you're framed.\\" Christopher in 2000 He was sent to supervise the contested Florida recount for Al Gore in the U.S. presidential election, 2000.

The third Earldom of Hertford was created in 1559 for Edward Seymour, who was simultaneously created Baron Beauchamp of Hache. His grandson William Seymour was subsequently created Marquess of Hertford and restored to the title of Duke of Somerset; the Marquessate became extinct in 1675 and the other three titles in 1750. The present Marquessate was created in 1793. Lord Hertford holds the subsidiary titles of Earl of Yarmouth (Peerage of Great Britain, 1793), Earl of Hertford (Peerage of Great Britain, 1750), Viscount Beauchamp (Peerage of Great Britain, 1750), Baron Conway, of Ragley in the County of Warwick (Peerage of England, 1703), and Baron Conway of Killultagh, of Killultagh in the County of Antrim (Peerage of Ireland, 1712). Lord Hertford's heir uses the style Earl of Yarmouth. The Marquesses of Hertford are members of the Seymour family headed by the Duke of Somerset. Francis Seymour (1679‚Äì1732) was the fourth son of Sir Edward Seymour of Berry Pomeroy, 4th Baronet, a descendant of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset (Sir Edward's grandson Sir Edward Seymour, 6th Baronet, of Berry Pomeroy succeeded as 8th Duke of Somerset in 1750). Upon the death of his elder brother, Francis succeeded to the estates of his relative Edward Conway, 1st Earl of Conway. In 1703 he was created Baron Conway in the Peerage of England and assumed the additional surname of Conway. In 1712 he was created Baron Conway of Killultagh in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1750 his son Francis Seymour-Conway, 2nd Baron Conway, was created Viscount Beauchamp and Earl of Hertford. These were revivals of titles previously held by the Dukes of Somerset, which had become extinct the same year on the death of Seymour-Conway's kinsman Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset. In 1793 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Yarmouth and Marquess of Hertford. The latter title had also previously been held by the Dukes of Somerset, but had become extinct in 1675 (see below). The family seat is Ragley Hall, near Alcester, Warwickshire.

Family history John Stuart was the member of a family that descended from John Stewart (born 1360), Sheriff of Bute, a natural son of Robert II of Scotland and his mistress Moira Leitch, married to Janet Sympil and in 1407 to Elizabeth Graham. This John Stewart was granted the lands of Bute, Arran and Cumbrae by his father.

James Stuart, seventh in descent from the Black Stewart, was created a Baronet, of Bute, in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia on 28 March 1627. His grandson, the third Baronet, represented Bute in the Parliament of Scotland and was one of the Commissioners that negotiated the Union between Scotland and England.

He was a politician and favourite of George III, and served as Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1762 to 1763. Lord Bute married Mary, daughter of Edward Wortley Montagu and his wife, the writer Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. In 1761 Mary was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain in her own right as Baroness Mount Stuart, of Wortley in the County of York, with remainder to the heirs male of her body by her then husband Lord Bute. This chest is on display at the Colintraive Hotel in Colintraive, Argyll & Bute They were both succeeded by their eldest son, the fourth Earl. In 1766, he married the Hon. Charlotte Jane, daughter and heiress of Herbert Windsor, 2nd Viscount Windsor, son of Thomas Windsor, 1st Viscount Windsor (see Viscount Windsor) and his wife Lady Charlotte, daughter of Philip Herbert, 7th Earl of Pembroke. Through this marriage vast estates in south Wales came into the Stuart family. In 1776, sixteen years before he succeeded his father in the earldom, he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain in his own right as Baron Cardiff, of Cardiff Castle in the County of Glamorgan, in recognition of his substantial Welsh estates. In 1796, he was further honoured when he was created Earl of Windsor and Viscount Mountjoy, in the Isle of Wight, revivals of the titles held by his wife's family, and Marquess of the County of Bute. These titles are also in the Peerage of Great Britain. Lord Bute's eldest son and heir, John Stuart, Lord Mount Stuart (who predeceased his father), married Lady Elizabeth Penelope, daughter and heiress of Patrick McDouall, 6th Earl of Dumfries (see the Earl of Dumfries). Lord Mount Stuart's eldest son John succeeded his maternal grandfather as seventh Earl of Dumfries in 1803, and his paternal grandfather as second Marquess of Bute in 1814. In 1805, he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Crichton before Stuart. He was succeeded by his only child, the third Marquess. He was an antiquarian, scholar, philanthropist and architectural patron and also held the post of Lord- Lieutenant of Buteshire. It was the 3rd Marquess who first converted to Catholicism (in late 1868),Bence-Jones, Mark, The Catholic Families (1992) London: Constable and Company Ltd., pp. 203‚Äì4 since which time the family have remained Catholic. His son, the fourth Marquess, was also Lord-Lieutenant of Buteshire. His grandson, John Crichton-Stuart, 6th Marquess of Bute (who succeeded his father), was Lord-Lieutenant of Buteshire from 1967 to 1975. As of 2013, the titles are held by the latter's eldest son, John Crichton-Stuart, 7th Marquess of Bute, who enjoyed a career as a racing driver during the 1980s. Other offices and duties The Marquess of Bute is the Hereditary Keeper of Rothesay Castle, a privilege granted to the ancestor of the Earls and Marquesses of Bute, John Stewart, by Robert II during the 14th century. In this capacity, the Crichton-Stuart family had been responsible for the upkeep and restoration of the castle up until the 1960s. This branch of the Stewart (also Stuart) family previously held the office of Hereditary High Steward of Scotland, an office now held by the Duke of Rothesay, in his capacity as a direct descendant of the House of Stuart.  Other family members  Numerous other members of the family have also gained distinction. Robert Stuart, younger son of the first Baronet, was created a Baronet in his own right in 1707. The Hon. James Stuart-Mackenzie, younger son of the second Earl, succeeded to the Mackenzie estates through his paternal grandmother and assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Mackenzie. He was a member of parliament. The Hon. James Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie, second son of the third Earl, was a politician and the father of James Stuart-Wortley, 1st Baron Wharncliffe (see the Earl of Wharncliffe for more information on this branch of the family). Lieutenant-General the Hon. Sir Charles Stuart, fourth son of the third Earl, was a distinguished soldier and the father of Charles Stuart, 1st Baron Stuart de Rothesay (see the Baron Stuart de Rothesay). The Most Reverend the Hon. William Stuart, fifth son of the third Earl, was Archbishop of Armagh. His son Sir William Stuart was a member of parliament. His eldest son William Stuart also sat as a member of parliament. Lady Louisa Stuart, daughter of the third Earl, was a writer. Lord Evelyn Stuart, second son of the first Marquess, was a soldier and politician. Lord Henry Crichton-Stuart, third son of the first Marquess, was the father of Henry Villiers-Stuart, 1st Baron Stuart de Decies (see the Baron Stuart de Decies for more information on this branch of the family). Lord William Stuart, fourth son of the first Marquess, was a Captain in the Royal Navy and Member of Parliament. Lord George Stuart (1780‚Äì1841), fifth son of the first Marquess, was a Rear-Admiral in the Royal Navy. Lord Dudley Stuart, sixth son of the first Marquess (and eldest from his second marriage), was a member of parliament. Lord Patrick Crichton-Stuart, second son of Lord Mount Stuart, eldest son of the first Marquess, was Member of Parliament for Cardiff. His eldest son James Crichton- Stuart also represented this constituency in Parliament. Lord Ninian Crichton- Stuart, second son of the third Marquess, was also Member of Parliament for Cardiff before his early death in the First World War. Lord Colum Crichton- Stuart, third and youngest son of the third Marquess, sat as Member of Parliament for Northwich for many years. Lord Robert Crichton-Stuart, second son of the fourth Marquess, was Lord-Lieutenant of Buteshire. The Earls and Marquesses of Bute originally used the courtesy title Lord Mount Stuart for the heir apparent. After the earldom of Dumfries was inherited by the second Marquess, the heir apparent has been styled Earl of Dumfries and his heir apparent is styled Lord Mount Stuart. The current heir John Bryson Crichton- Stuart was styled as Lord Mount Stuart for some years after his father inherited the marquessate in 1993. This was because his father was well known as, Johnny Dumfries, Earl of Dumfries. However, the current heir is now styled using the traditional title of the heir ‚Äì Earl of Dumfries. He is known as Jack Dumfries for short, and his father is often known as John or Johnny Bute.  Heraldic achievement (coat of arms) Seats The family seat is Mount Stuart near Rothesay on the Isle of Bute. Between 1994 and 2007, the current Marquess approached The National Trust for Scotland with offers to acquire Dumfries House, near Cumnock, East Ayrshire which had been the second seat of the Crichton-Stuarts since their union in 1792. In 2007 Dumfries House was acquired by a charitable trust, The Great Steward of Scotland's Dumfries House Trust, with financial support from The Prince Charles, Duke of Rothesay. Following refurbishment, it opened to the public on 6 June 2008.Dumfries House accessed 11 June 2008. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/property/8533968/Dumfries-House-a- Sleeping-Beauty-brought-back-to-life-by-the-Prince-of-Wales.html https://dumfries-house.org.uk/about/history Stuart Baronets, of Bute (1627) *Sir James Stuart, 1st Baronet (d. 1662) *Sir Dugald Stuart, 2nd Baronet (d. 1670) *Sir James Stuart, 3rd Baronet (d. 1710) (created Earl of Bute in 1703) Earls of Bute (1703) * James Stuart, 1st Earl of Bute (d. 1710) * James Stuart, 2nd Earl of Bute (d. 1723) * John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute (1713‚Äì1792) * John Stuart, 4th Earl of Bute (1744‚Äì1814) (created Marquess of Bute in 1796) Marquesses of Bute (1796) *John Stuart, 1st Marquess of Bute (1744‚Äì1814) *John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute (1793‚Äì1848) (had succeeded as Earl of Dumfries in 1803) *John Patrick Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute (1847‚Äì1900) *John Crichton-Stuart, 4th Marquess of Bute (1881‚Äì1947) *John Crichton-Stuart, 5th Marquess of Bute (1907‚Äì1956) *John Crichton-Stuart, 6th Marquess of Bute (1933‚Äì1993) *John Colum Crichton-Stuart, 7th Marquess of Bute (b. 1958) The heir apparent is the present holder's son John Bryson Crichton-Stuart, Earl of Dumfries (b. 1989).

At the time, under the Articles of Confederation, each state was largely independent from the others, and the national government had no authority to regulate trade between and among the states. New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and North Carolina had appointed commissioners, who failed to arrive in Annapolis in time to attend the meeting, and Connecticut, Maryland, South Carolina, and Georgia had taken no action at all. Convention Most of the delegates to the meeting were tasked only to take up the issue of trade among the states, but New Jersey's delegates were authorized to discuss a broader scope of reforms. The group realized that the issue of trade touched upon many other aspects of the Confederation and that a future meeting with a broader scope would be necessary to adequately address the problems. The final report of the convention was adopted unanimously and sent to the Congress of the Confederation and to the states. It sought support for a broader constitutional convention to be held the following May in Philadelphia. It hoped that more states would be represented and that their delegates or deputies would be authorized to examine areas broader than simply commercial trade. Aftermath Because of the few representatives in attendance, their authority was limited. It is unclear how much weight the convention's call carried, but the urgency of the need for constitutional reform was highlighted by a number of rebellions that took place all over the country. Although most of them were easily suppressed, Shays' Rebellion lasted from August 1786 to February 1787. The rebellion called attention to both popular discontent and government weakness.Milkis, S., Nelson, M., The American Presidency. Washington: CQPess, 2003. Fourth Edition.

It was created in 1789 for George Beresford, 2nd Earl of Tyrone. It is presently held by Henry Beresford, 9th Marquess of Waterford. The Beresford family descends from Tristram Beresford, who originated from Kent but settled in Ireland in the 17th century. His eldest son Tristram Beresford sat as a member of the Irish House of Commons. On 5 May 1665 he was created a baronet, of Coleraine in County Londonderry, in the Baronetage of Ireland. His great-grandson (the title having descended from father to son), the fourth Baronet, married Lady Catherine, oldest daughter of James de la Poer, 3rd Earl of Tyrone (see Earl of Tyrone). In 1720, he was created both Baron Beresford, of Beresford, in the County of Cavan, and Viscount Tyrone in the Peerage of Ireland. He was further honoured when he was made Earl of Tyrone in the Peerage of Ireland in 1746. In 1767, four years after his death, the Dowager Countess of Tyrone was confirmed with the hereditary peerage title Baroness La Poer in the Peerage of Ireland (created by writ ca. 1650). Lord Tyrone was succeeded by his fourth but eldest surviving son, the second Earl, who also inherited the title Baron La Poer from his mother in 1769. In 1786 he was created Baron Tyrone, of Haverfordwest in the County of Pembroke, in the Peerage of Great Britain. Three years later he was made Marquess of Waterford in the Peerage of Ireland. The titles descended in the direct line until the death of his grandson, the third Marquess, in 1859. The late Marquess was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Marquess. the titles are held by the latter's great-great-great- grandson, the ninth Marquess, who succeeded his father in 2015. John Beresford, younger son of the first Earl of Tyrone and probably the most influential member of the Beresford family. Several other members of the Beresford family have also gained distinction. John Beresford, fifth son of the first Earl, was an influential statesman. Marcus Beresford, eldest son of John Beresford, represented Dungarvan in the Irish Parliament. His second son was the Conservative politician William Beresford, who was the father of Mostyn Beresford (1835‚Äì1911), a Lieutenant-General in the Army, and of Edward Marcus Beresford (1836‚Äì1896), a Major-General in the Army. The Right Reverend George Beresford, second son of John Beresford, was Bishop of Kilmore. His son the Most Reverend Marcus Beresford was Archbishop of Armagh. He was the father of George Beresford, a politician, and of Major Henry Marcus Beresford, who was the father of the photographer George Charles Beresford. John Claudius Beresford, third son of John Beresford, was a politician. William Beresford, seventh son of the first Earl, was Archbishop of Tuam and was created Baron Decies in 1812. Lord John Beresford, second surviving son of the first Marquess, was Archbishop of Armagh. Lord George Beresford, younger son of the first Marquess, was a politician. William Beresford, illegitimate son of the first Marquess, was a Field Marshal in the British Army and was created Viscount Beresford in 1823. John Beresford, illegitimate son of the first Marquess, was a soldier and politician and was created a baronet in 1814 (see Beresford-Peirse baronets).

His films include Hang Your Dog in the Wind, Nothing So Strange, and The God Who Wasn't There. His musicals include Bat Boy: The Musical, which won the LA Weekly Theater Award, Lucille Lortel Award, and Outer Critics Circle Award. He advocates for the Free culture movement and is an outspoken atheist.  Early career  Flemming's first feature film was the low-budget Hang Your Dog in the Wind. Partly to promote his film, Flemming co-founded a punk film festival in Park City, Utah, called the Slumdance Film Festival, a pun on the name of the Slamdance Film Festival (which in turn referred to the Sundance Film Festival). Slumdance brought Flemming to the attention of John Pierson, who later hired Flemming to work as a director and segment producer for Pierson's Independent Film Channel magazine-style show called Split Screen.  Bat Boy  After Slumdance, Flemming turned his attention from indie film to theater with Bat Boy: The Musical. The stage musical is based on a story about a half- bat half-boy from the tabloid Weekly World News. Flemming co-wrote Bat Boy with Keythe Farley and Laurence O'Keefe. The musical grew from a Los Angeles theater to winning the LA Weekly Theater Award for Musical of the Year Award for 1999, plus four Ovation Award nominations and six Drama-Logue Awards. Bat Boy: The Musical made its way to a New York production in March 2001, for which the play won the Lucille Lortel Award for Best Musical, the Outer Critics Circle Award for Best Musical Off-Broadway, and six Drama Desk nominations. The New Yorker described Bat Boy as a \\"giggling cult hit\\". The New York Times wrote, \\"It is astonishing what intelligent wit can accomplish\\". The musical ran in New York through December 2001.  Nothing So Strange  Flemming released a faux documentary about the assassination of Bill Gates called Nothing So Strange. Bill Gates said through a spokesman that it was \\"very disappointing that a movie maker would do something like this\\". Nothing So Strange debuted at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival. Variety called it, \\"a crackling good movie... [that] may be the ideal prototype film for the digital age\\". The film won the Claiborne Pell New York Times Award for Original Vision at the 2002 Newport Film Festival. On 24 October 2003 the film had a simultaneous debut in theaters and as an Internet download. It was released on DVD in December 2004.  The God Who Wasn't There  In 2005, Flemming released his third feature-length film, the documentary The God Who Wasn't There. Through interviews with biblical and folklore scholars, Flemming investigates the evidence for the existence of Jesus, concluding that it is highly improbable that the Christian savior ever actually lived. He then discusses the beliefs of conservative Christian fundamentalists, Christian moderates (who, he states, simply enable the fundamentalists), and returns to confront the principal of the fundamentalist Christian school he attended as a child. Flemming launched three media campaigns to support his documentary: War on Christmas, War on Easter, and Blasphemy Challenge. The Blasphemy Challenge was the most successful of the three publicity stunts, gaining coverage by Newsweek, NBC News, Fox News and many other media outlets, and participation by Penn Jillette.  Activism  In addition to working in film and theater, Flemming is an activist on copyright issues. He has released Nothing So Strange as an open source project, which means all of the raw footage that makes up the film is released without copyright restrictions for anyone to use. The final cut of the film, however, remains protected by copyright. Flemming founded the organization Free Cinema, which encourages feature filmmakers to create films under two rules: # No money may be spent on the production, and # The film must be released under a copyleft license. Flemming claims that filmmaking can now be \\"as inexpensive as writing novels\\" and that the copylefting practice is a way for new artists to gain notice and distribution in a marketplace dominated by large corporations. Free Cinema was inspired by the Free Software Movement, which is guided by similar principles of freedom. Flemming is also the owner and operator of Fair Use Press, which distributes e-books critical of public figures such as Bill O'Reilly and Arnold Schwarzenegger for their stance on intellectual property law. During the 2007 Slamdance Film Festival, Flemming, who had been invited to sit on the festival's documentary jury, saw a demo of the video game Super Columbine Massacre RPG! and hearing about it having its nomination pulled by the festival's founder, convinced fellow jurors to award it a \\"Special Jury Prize\\" for Best Documentary (an unofficial award not endorsed by the festival). The festival's founder, Peter Baxter, later told Flemming that legal considerations prevented SCMRPG from receiving the award.

Broderick, 2006 (Page 151) Plot The episode begins with Commander Tucker and Ensign Mayweather gathering readings on a third sphere in the Delphic Expanse. Some time later, Enterprise receives a distress call from a Triannon ship which reports they have been damaged by a spatial anomaly. Enterprise takes them aboard, and D'Jamat, the leader of the group, has dinner with Captain Archer where he explains they have been on a year-long pilgrimage to a sphere. They believe deities, called the \\"Makers,\\" constructed the spheres to transform the expanse, their ‚ÄúChosen Realm,‚Äù into a paradise. D'Jamat then rejects T'Pol's scientific logic that there are only 59 known spheres. Some time later, D'Jamat demands Archer turn over control of the ship or it will be destroyed, and demonstrates this by having one of his group self-detonate, killing one crew member. Having little choice, Archer submits. D'Jamat then sets a course for his home world and explains that he intends to use Enterprise to end a religious civil war that has embroiled his planet for a century. D'Jamat also examines the ship's records and finds that Enterprise had extensive contact with the spheres‚Äîa severe violation under his faith. He then erases 19 XB of sphere data, but as a 'compromise' to his faith, rather than put the entire crew to death for blasphemy, he demands that Archer choose just one crew member to die. While Archer is contemplating his decision he approaches Yarrick, D'Jamat's deputy, questioning his resolve, but Yarrick rebuffs him. Archer then tells D'Jamat that he has selected himself to be killed, but requests it be done using a device they use for \\"waste disposal\\". That device turns out to be the transporter, which T'Pol uses to beam Archer elsewhere on the ship. Archer then contacts Doctor Phlox and they develop an airborne agent to neutralize the Triannon's organic explosives. Archer again confronts Yarrick and convinces him to help disperse the agent throughout the ship, learning in the process that the religious war is primarily based around a difference of opinion over whether it took nine or ten days to for the Makers to complete their work. Meanwhile, four ships from the \\"heretic\\" Triannon faction intercept Enterprise. During the fight, the crew manage to subdue D'Jamat and end the battle. In the brig, D'Jamat remains convinced his actions were justified, so Archer takes him down to their planet - which lies in ruins, having been ravaged by the war. The episode ends with the Triannons staring in horror at their completely devastated world.  Cast  * Scott Bakula...Capt. Jonathan Archer * John Billingsley...Dr. Phlox * Jolene Blalock...Sub-Cmdr.

It was created in 1789 for Wills Hill, 1st Earl of Hillsborough, a former Secretary of State. Hill had already been created Earl of Hillsborough and Viscount Kilwarlin of County Down in the Peerage of Ireland in 1751 with remainder, in default of male issue of his own, to his uncle Arthur Hill, 1st Viscount Dungannon. He was further created Baron Harwich, of Harwich in the County of Essex, in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1756 with a seat in the British House of Lords. In 1772 he was further ennobled with a second Earldom of Hillsborough and as Viscount Fairford in the County of Gloucester, both in the Peerage of Great Britain. Downshire was the eldest son of Trevor Hill, who had been created Viscount Hillsborough and Baron Hill of Kilwarlin in County Down, in the Peerage of Ireland in 1717, with remainder, in default of male issue of his own, to the male issue of his father, Michael Hill. Trevor Hill was the brother of the aforementioned Arthur Hill, 1st Viscount Dungannon. In 2013, the 9th Marquess succeeded, under the terms of a special remainder of 1802, to the title Baron Sandys.

This occurred in April 2013 with the death of Richard Hill, 7th Baron Sandys without male heirs. Prior to the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999, the Marquesses sat in the House of Lords as the Earls of Hillsborough. Among many other estates, the Marquess owned Hillsborough Castle, the Blessington Estate in County Wicklow, and Easthampstead Park near Bracknell.

In the early 20th century, Cocker Spaniels also included small hunting spaniels. Cocker Spaniels were originally bred as hunting dogs in the United Kingdom, with the term \\"cocker\\" deriving from their use to hunt the Eurasian woodcock. When the breed was brought to the United States, it was bred to a different standard, which enabled it to specialize in hunting the American woodcock. Further physical changes were bred into the cocker in the United States during the early part of the 20th century. Spaniels were first mentioned in the 14th century by Gaston III, Count of Foix in his work the Livre de Chasse. The \\"cocking\\" or \\"cocker spaniel\\" was a type of field or land spaniel in the 19th century. Prior to 1901, Cocker Spaniels were only separated from Field Spaniels and Springer Spaniels by weight. Two dogs are considered to be the foundation sires of both modern breeds, the English variety are descended from Ch. Obo, while the American breed descends from Obo's son, Ch. Obo II. In the United States, the English Cocker was recognized as separate from the native breed in 1946; in the UK, the American type was recognized as a separate breed in 1970. In addition, a second strain of English Cocker Spaniel, a working strain, is not bred to a standard, but to working ability. Both breeds share similar coat colors and health issues with a few exceptions. History A drawing of English and Welsh Cockers, from John Henry Walsh's (under the pseudonym \\"Stonehenge\\") 1859 work The Dog in Health and Disease While their origins are unknown, \\"spaynels\\" are mentioned in 14th-century writings.Sucher (1999): p. 7 They are commonly assumed to have originated in Spain, and Edward, 2nd Duke of York in his 15th-century work The Master of Game introduces them as \\"Another kind of hound there is that be called hounds for the hawk and spaniels, for their kind cometh from Spain, notwithstanding that there are many in other countries.\\"York (1909): p. 119 The Master of Game was mostly an English translation of an earlier 14th century Old French work by Gaston III of Foix-B√©arn entitled Livre de Chasse.York (1909): p. xii In 1801, Sydenham Edwards wrote in Cynographia Britannica that the \\"Land Spaniel\\" is divided into two types: the hawking, springing/springer and the cocking/cocker spaniel. The term \\"cocker\\" came from the dog's use in hunting woodcocks. During the 19th century, a \\"cocker spaniel\\" was a type of small Field Spaniel; at the time, this term referred to a number of different spaniel hunting breeds, including the Norfolk Spaniel, Sussex Spaniel, and Clumber Spaniel. While no Sussex Cockers or Clumber Cockers existed, some dogs were known as Welsh Cockers and Devonshire Cockers. The Welsh or Devonshire were considered cockers until 1903, when they were recognized by The Kennel Club as the Welsh Springer Spaniel. Ch. Obo II, foundation sire of the American Cocker Spaniel Prior to the 1870s, the only requirement for a dog to be classed as a Cocker Spaniel was that it needed to weigh less than , although breeders separated the cocker from the King Charles Spaniel, which remains a smaller breed of spaniel.Sucher (1999): p. 8 This maximum weight limit remained on the Cocker Spaniel until 1900, with larger dogs being classed as Springer Spaniels. The colors of the Devonshire and Welsh Cockers were described by John Henry Walsh under the pseudonym Stonehenge in his book The Dog in Health and Disease as being a deeper shade of liver than that of the Sussex Spaniel.Walsh (1887): p. 109 Following the formation of The Kennel Club in the UK in 1873, efforts were made by breeders to record the pedigrees of cockers and springers. In 1892, English Cocker Spaniels and English Springer Spaniels were recognized as separate breeds by The Kennel Club.Palika (2009): p. 19 Two dogs are thought to be the foundation sires of both modern breeds of cocker spaniels. Ch. Obo is considered by breed enthusiasts to be the father of the modern English Cocker Spaniel, while his son, Ch. Obo II, is considered to be the progenitor of the American Cocker Spaniel. Obo was born in 1879, when registration as a cocker was still only by size and not by ancestry. He was the son of a Sussex Spaniel and a Field Spaniel. Although Obo was an English dog, Obo II was born on American shores - his mother was shipped to the United States while pregnant.Palika (2009): p. 21 During his lifetime, Obo II was claimed in advertisements to be the sire or grandsire of nearly every prize-winning cocker in America. Modern breeds A graph showing the height and shape difference between the American and English Cocker American Cocker Spaniel English Cocker Spaniel The two breeds of cocker spaniel are the English Cocker Spaniel and the American Cocker Spaniel. They were bred as gun dogs, to use their sense of smell to cover low areas near the handler to flush birds into the air to be shot, and to use their eyes and nose to locate the bird once downed, and then to retrieve the bird with a soft mouth. The major differences between the English and American varieties is that the American is smaller with a shorter back, a domed head, and a shorter muzzle, while the English variety is taller with a narrower head and chest. Cocker Spaniel coats occur in a variety of colors, including black, liver, red, and golden in solids. Also, black and tan, and sometimes liver and tan are known, as well as a variety of color mixtures of those solid colors including roans, roan and tans, tricolors, and those solid colors with additional white markings. Rare colours can appear unexpectedly in certain lines, for instance while an all- white cocker is usually bred by selective breeding of very light golden strains, they can still appear very uncommonly to parents that are dark- colored. A noted occurrence of this happened in 1943, when a grandson of My Own Brucie, Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1940 and 1941, was born all-white. In its native United States, the American Cocker Spaniel was ranked the 23rd-most popular breed according to registration statistics of the AKC in 2009, a decrease in popularity since 1999, when it was ranked 13th. For 25 years, the American Cocker Spaniel was the most popular dog in America. It was ranked number one first in 1936 prior to the English Cocker Spaniel being recognized as a separate breed, and held onto the spot until 1952, when Beagles became the most popular dogs. It regained the spot in 1983 and held on at number one until 1990. In the UK, the American Cocker Spaniel is far less popular than its English relative, with 322 registrations compared to the English Cocker's 22,211 in 2009. English Cocker Spaniel A golden English Cocker Spaniel of the show strain English Cocker Spaniel puppy A black English Cocker Spaniel age 4 Called simply Cocker Spaniel in the UK, this is the breed that was originally recognized by The Kennel Club (KC) in 1892. The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the English Cocker Spaniel as a separate breed in 1946. The size of the English Cocker Spaniel according to the KC is at the withers for males, and for females. The weight of a show dog should be . The English Cocker Spaniel is the most successful breed at the most popular dog show in the UK, Crufts, with seven best-in-show wins since the prize was first awarded in 1928. This was mostly due to the success of dog breeder H.S. Lloyd's Ware Kennel, dogs of which won best-in-show on six occasions between 1930-1950. They are the second most popular dog breed in the UK according to statistics released by the KC with 22,211 registrations in 2009, beaten only by the Labrador Retriever with 40,943. In third place was the English Springer Spaniel with 12,700. The English Cocker's popularity has increased steadily since 1999 in the United States when they were ranked 76th in registrations by the AKC, to 2009 when they were ranked 66th. Physical differences exist between the show strain and working strain in the UK. While the show strain is bred to the conformation standard, the working strain is bred for working ability, and as such, several physical differences have appeared. Working-type dogs tend to be larger with flatter heads and shorter ears. The coat also tends to be shorter and finer than the show variety and have less feathering. The working strain seems to be more energetic than the show strain. American Cocker Spaniel A recently groomed American Cocker Spaniel Cocker Spaniels were recognized by the AKC in 1878. Generally smaller than the English, separate classes were created for the two types in America in 1935 and the Cocker Spaniel Club of America discouraged breeding between the two types in 1938. The American Cocker Spaniel was recognized as a separate breed by the KC in the UK in 1970. The American Cocker Spaniel is referred to as the Cocker Spaniel within the United States. The American Cocker Spaniel was bred smaller, as American woodcocks are smaller than their European relatives, and the breed's appearance changed slightly during the first part of the 20th century, as the preference by American breeders was for a more stylish appearance. The standard size according to the AKC is between at the withers for males and for females. The weight of the breed is typically between . At the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, the most prestigious dog show in the United States, the American Cocker Spaniel has won Best in Show on four occasions since its first award in 1907. The most successful breed is the Wire Fox Terrier with 13 wins. The American Cocker Spaniel is judged in three separate breed classes under AKC rules; \\"black\\", \\"parti-color\\", and \\"any solid color other than black...\\" (ASCOB). Sophia and Olivia won the gold medal of dog showing in 2012. Common health issues Cocker Spaniel In a survey conducted by the Kennel Club (UK), the American Cocker Spaniels had a median age of death of 10 years and 4 months, while the English Cocker Spaniel had a median age of 11 years and 2 months. According to the survey, the most common cause of death for both breeds was cancer, while old age was the second-most common cause. The two modern breeds are susceptible to several health problems. Issues common to the two breeds include ear infections and a variety of eye problems. Many breeds are susceptible to hip dysplasia. In a survey conducted by Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, the American Cocker Spaniel was ranked 115th out of 157 different breeds, with one being the highest percentage dysplastic and 157 being the lowest percentage dysplastic. The English Cocker was ranked 129th. Otitis externa Severe otitis externa in a cocker spaniel, the ear canal is inflamed and swollen shut. Cocker Spaniels and other dogs that have long, pendulous ears are more predisposed to ear problems than some other breeds. The fold of the ear can prevent air from entering, and it also creates a warm, moist environment where organisms can grow. Otitis externa is an inflammation of the ear canal which can be caused by a variety of factors including parasites, microorganisms, foreign bodies, tumors, and underlying dermatological disease. Ear mites can cause otitis externa; ticks and fleas can also live in dogs' ear canals. The most common types of canine ear infections are caused by microorganisms, including yeast and bacterial infections. The most common variety of this is Malaysia pachyderms. Symptoms can include the dog shaking its head or scratching at its ears more frequently. The ear canal appears inflamed, a pus-like substance can be discharged in some cases, and the ear may smell quite pungent in most cases. Treatment for the more common causes of otitis externa in dogs often includes oral antibiotics and flushing the ears with an antibacterial solution. In some cases, anti-inflammatory medication is prescribed. Some conditions can increase the chance of ear infections, including living in a humid environment and frequent swimming or bathing without adequate drying of the ear afterwards. Keeping the hair on the ears short can be used as a preventive method to ear problems. Skin infections may also be caused by nutritional deficiencies. Vitamins A and B, zinc, and fatty acids all contribute to dermatological health, by maintaining keratinization and water levels of the skin. As long as these particular nutrients are regulated to sufficient levels in the diet, skin problems caused by deficiencies are unlikely to occur. Eye conditions Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is a group of diseases that affect a dog's eyesight and can lead to blindness. It has been documented in many dog breeds including both the American and English Cocker Spaniels. The two types of Cockers are susceptible to a specific type of PRA called progressive rod-cone degeneration (PRCD); symptoms include night blindness leading to total blindness between the ages of three and five. PRCD is the most widespread hereditary retinal disease which may lead to blindness in dogs. Another leading cause of blindness is canine glaucoma, which is an increase in the pressure of the fluid in the eye; if left untreated, it can cause visual impairment and eventual loss of sight. The condition can be inherited (primary glaucoma) or a secondary condition to a variety of other eye issues including tumors or lens luxation. Both breeds are affected by juvenile cataracts, which can occur up to four years of age. Symptoms can include discoloring of the pupil, and treatment may include surgery to remove the cataract. Temperament Cocker Spaniels have a sweet disposition and tend to be intelligent, making them a good pet for families in particular. This breed of dog is easy to train, but due to their sensitive nature, do not tend to respond well to harsh training methods. Training using positive reinforcement and encouragement is the best method for the Cocker Spaniel. Cocker Spaniels can suffer from separation anxiety and best enjoy being in a household environment around people. That said, the Cocker Spaniel was bred as a hunting dog and needs regular exercise outdoors. Up to an hour a day is usually enough. In popular culture Lady, a female American Cocker Spaniel, is featured in the 1955 Disney film Lady and the Tramp and the 2019 film with the same name. Similarly, a Cocker Spaniel called Charkie features in the popular children's book and TV series, Curious George. Also, a Cocker Spaniel is on the Coppertone sunscreen bottle. Bill, one of the main characters in the cartoon Boule et Bill, is a cocker spaniel.

Cityscape Ed Meagher of the Los Angeles Times wrote in 1955 that the 110-block area on the north side of San Fernando Road in Pacoima consisted of what he described as a \\"smear of sagging, leaning shacks and backhouses framed by disintegrating fences and clutter of tin cans, old lumber, stripped automobiles, bottles, rusted water heaters and other bric-a-brac of the back alleys.\\"Meagher, Ed. \\"Pacoima Area Revamped by Awakened Citizenry.\\" Los Angeles Times. May 18, 1955. A1. Two Pages Local News. Retrieved on March 18, 2010. In 1955 Pacoima lacked curbs, paved sidewalks, and paved streets. Pacoima had what Meagher described as \\"dusty footpaths and rutted dirt roads that in hard rains become beds for angry streams.\\" Meagher added that the 450 houses in the area, with 2,000 inhabitants, \\"squatted\\" \\"within this clutch of residential blight.\\" He described most of the houses as \\"substandard.\\" Around 1955, the price of residential property increased in value, as lots that sold years prior for $100 sold for $800 in 1955. Between 1950 and 1955, property values on Van Nuys Boulevard increased six times. In late 1952, the Los Angeles City Council allowed the Building and Safety Department to begin a slum clearance project to try to force homeowners who had houses deemed substandard to repair, demolish, or vacate those houses. In early 1955, the city began a $500,000 project to add of curbs, sidewalks, and streets. Meagher said that the \\"neatness and cleanness\\" of the new infrastructure were \\"a challenge to homeowners grown apathetic to thoroughfares ankle deep in mud or dust.\\" Some area businessmen established the San Fernando Valley Commercial & Savings Bank in November 1953 to finance area rehabilitation projects after other banks persistently refused to give loans to those projects. In late 1966, a 48 page city planning report criticized the central business district of Pacoima along Van Nuys Boulevard for being \\"a rambling, shallow strip pattern of commercial uses... varying from banks to hamburger stands, including an unusual number of small business and service shops.\\" A Los Angeles Times article stated that the physical image of the area was \\"somewhat depressing.\\" The council recommended the establishment of smaller community shopping centers. The article stated that the Pacoima Chamber of Commerce was expected to oppose the recommendation, and that the chamber favored deepening of the existing commercial zones along Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Van Nuys Boulevard. The council criticized the lack of parking spaces and storefronts that appeared in disrepair or vacant. The report also recommended establishing shopping centers in areas outside of the Laurel Canyon-Van Nuys commercial axis. The article stated that some sections of Laurel Canyon were \\"in a poor state of repair\\" and that there were \\"conspicuously minimal\\" curbs and sidewalks. The report recommended continued efforts to improve sidewalks and trees. The report also advocated the establishment of a community center to, in the words of the article, \\"give Pacoima a degree of unity.\\" Most of the residences in Pacoima were, in the words of the article, \\"of an older vintage.\\" The article said most of the houses and yards, especially in the R-2 duplex zones, exhibited \\"sign[s] of neglect.\\" The report said that the range of types of houses was \\"unusually narrow for a community of this size.\\" The report also said that the fact had a negative effect on the community that was reflected by a lack of purchasing power.

Williams added that many of the retail outlets in Pacoima consisted of check cashing outlets, storefront churches, pawn shops, and automobile repair shops. Williams added that the nearest bank to the commercial strip was \\"several blocks away.\\" In 1994 almost one third of Pacoima's residents lived in public housing complexes. Williams said that the complexes had relatively little graffiti. Many families who were on waiting lists to enter public housing complexes lived in garages and converted tool sheds, which often lacked electricity, heat, and/or running water. Williams said that they lived \\"out of sight.\\" History=Pre‚ÄìUnited States The area was first inhabited by the Fernande√±o-Tongva and Tataviam people, California Indian Tribes, now known as Tataviam Band of Mission Indians.McCawley, William The First Angelinos: The Fernandeno Indians of Mission de Fernndo Ballena Press, 1996 The original name for the Native American village in this area was actually Pakoinga or Pak…®ynga in Fernande√±o, but since the \\"ng\\" sound (a voiced velar nasal) did not exist in Spanish, the Spaniards mistook the sound as an \\"m\\" and recorded the name as Pacoima, as we see today. Pacoima's written history dates to 1769 when Spaniards entered the San Fernando Valley. In 1771, nearby Mission San Fernando Rey was founded, with Native Americans creating gardens for the mission in the area. They lived at the mission working on the gardens which, in a few years, had stretched out over most of the valley. The Mexican government secularized the mission lands in 1834 by taking them away from the church. The first governor of California, Pio Pico, leased the lands to Andr√©s Pico, his brother. In 1845, Pio Pico sold the whole San Fernando Valley to Don Eulogio de Celis for $14,000 to raise money for the war between Mexico and the United States, settled by a treaty signed at Campo de Cahuenga in 1845, and by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848. The Pacoima area became sheep ranches and wheat fields. United StatesPioneer Pacoima= In 1873, Senator Charles Maclay of Santa Clara purchased 56,000 acres in the northern part of the San Fernando Valley adjacent to the San Fernando Mission and in 1887, Jouett Allen bought 1,000 acres of land between the Pacoima Wash and the Tujunga Wash. The land he purchased was from the Maclay Rancho Water Company, which had taken over Senator Charles Maclay‚Äôs holdings in the Valley. Allen retained 500 acres for himself and subdivided the remainder in one acre tracts. It was from this that the town of Pacoima was born. The subdivision‚Äôs original boundaries were Paxton Street on the north, Herrick Avenue on the east, Pierce Street on the south, & San Fernando Road on the west. The town was built in keeping with the new Southern Pacific railroad station. Shortly after the rail line had been established, the Southern Pacific Railroad chose the site for a large brick passenger station, which was considered to be one of the finest on their line. Soon large spacious and expensive two-story homes made their appearance, as the early planners had established building restrictions against anything of a lesser nature. The first concrete sidewalks and curbs were laid and were to remain the only ones in the San Fernando Valley for many years. In 1888, the town's main street, one hundred feet wide and eight miles long, was laid through the center of the subdivision. The street was first named Taylor Avenue after President Taylor; later it was re-named Pershing Street. Today it is known it by its present name‚ÄîVan Nuys Boulevard. Building codes were established: requiring that homes built cost at least USD$2,000. The land deed contained a clause that if liquor was sold on this property, it would revert to Jouett Allen or his heirs. Newspaper advertisement for Pacoima lots, 1905 But like the railroad station, the large hotel, the big two-story school building and many commercial buildings, most were torn down within a few years as the boom days receded. The early pioneers had frowned upon industry, which eventually resulted in the people moving away from the exclusive suburb which they had set up to establish new homes closer to their employment and Pacoima returned to its rural, agricultural roots. In 1916, the presently named Pacoima Chamber of Commerce was established as the Pacoima Chamber of Farmers. For many years, the fertile soil produced abundant crops of olives, peaches, apricots, oranges and lemons. The opening of the Los Angeles Aqueduct brought a new supply of water to the area. With the new water supply, the number of orchards, farms and poultry ranches greatly increased and thoroughbred horses began to be raised. Los Angeles annexed the land, including Pacoima, as part of ordinance 32192 N.S. on May 22, 1915.\\"Annexation and Detachment Map.\\" City of Los Angeles. Retrieved on March 19, 2010. = 1940s and World War II = During World War II, the rapid expansion of the workforce at Lockheed's main plant in neighboring Burbank and need for worker housing led to the construction of the San Fernando Gardens housing project. By the 1950s, the rapid suburbanization of the San Fernando Valley arrived in Pacoima, and the area changed almost overnight from a dusty farming area to a bedroom community for the fast-growing industries in Los Angeles and nearby Burbank and Glendale, with transportation to and from Pacoima made easy by the Golden State Freeway. Beginning in the late 1940s, parts of Pacoima started becoming a place where Southern Californians escaping poverty in rural areas settled. In the post-World War II era, many African Americans settled in Pacoima after arriving in the area during the second wave of the Great Migration since they had been excluded from other neighborhoods due to racially discriminatory covenants. By 1960, almost all of the 10,000 African Americans in the San Fernando Valley lived in Pacoima and Arleta as it became the center of African-American life in the Valley.4 Williams, Timothy. \\"Poverty, Pride--and Power In Line for Federal Help, Pacoima Hides Problems Below Neat Surface\\", Los Angeles Times, April 10, 1994, Retrieved on March 17, 2010. = 1957 Airplane crashes= On January 31, 1957, a Douglas DC-7B operated by Douglas Aircraft Company was involved in a mid-air collision and crashed into the schoolyard of Pacoima Middle School, then named Pacoima Junior High School.Hill, Gladwyn. \\"7 Die as Planes Collide and One Falls in Schoolyard; PLANES COLLIDE, SCHOOL YARD HIT Roar Alerts Students 'Everything on Fire' Witness Describes Crash\\", The New York Times, February 1, 1957, Retrieved on February 3, 2010. \\"Wreckage of airliner falls into school yard at Pacoima, Calif.\\"\\"31-JAN-1957 Douglas DC-7B N8210H.\\" Aviation Safety Network.

By the late 1960s, immigrants from rural Mexico began to move to Pacoima due to the low housing costs and the neighborhood's proximity to manufacturing jobs. African Americans who were better established began to move out and, in an example of ethnic succession, within less than two decades, the African American population was replaced by a poorer Latino immigrant population. 75% of Pacoima's residents were African Americans in the 1970s. According to the 1990 U.S. Census, 71% of Pacoima's population was of Hispanic/Latino descent while 10% was African American.

Pacoima Neighborhood City Hall - The Pacoima Neighborhood City Hall (NCH), located in Council District 7, was completed in 2011 at a cost of $19 million. At the time of construction, it was intended that this two story 12,700 square foot structure would house decentralized City services and serve as a local one-stop location for local residents. However, as a result of the downturn in the economy in 2009 and attrition and downsizing of the City's workforce, the previous strategy to house City functions and provide services from the City Hall has changed. In addition, a Request For Proposals, released by the GSD Real Estate Services to identify retailers to occupy the 2,370 square foot retail component of the facility did not receive any responses from local retailers. Over the last two years, Council District 7 has worked to identify local non-profit organizations that can occupy the space and provide beneficial services to the community.file:///C:/Users/rcast/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/IE/BDOROY0X/12-1642_MISC_04-04-13.pdf Economy In the early 1950s to early 1960s, which was the time of the greatest single-family housing construction and population expansion in Pacoima, most residents worked in construction, factory and other blue-collar fields. By 1994 this had changed and many Pacoima residents were then employed at area factories. From 1990 to 1994, Lockheed cut over 8,000 jobs at its Burbank, California plant. General Motors closed its Van Nuys plant in 1992, causing the loss of 2,600 jobs. Timothy Williams of the Los Angeles Times wrote in 1994, \\"For years, those relatively high-paying jobs had provided families with a springboard out of the San Fernando Gardens and Van Nuys Pierce Park Apartments public housing complexes.\\" After the jobs were lost, many longtime Pacoima residents left the area. In the 1990 U.S. Census the unemployment rate in Pacoima was almost 14%, while the City of Los Angeles had an overall 8.4% overall unemployment rate. Many Pacoima residents who worked made less than $14,000 annually: the U.S. government's poverty line for a family of four. Most residents owned their houses.

Timothy Williams of the Los Angeles Times said that an \\"unprecedented wave of activism\\" countered the crime surge. Residents led by social institutions such as churches, schools, and social service agencies held marches and rallies. Schools remained open on weekends and in evenings to offer recreational and tutoring programs. Residents circulated petitions to try to stop the establishment of liquor stores. Residents began holding weekly meetings with a gang that, according to Williams, \\"had long been a neighborhood scourge.\\" Area police officers said, in Williams's words, \\"although crime in Pacoima remains a major problem\\", particularly in the area within the empowerment zone proposed by area politicians in the 1990s, \\"the situation is far improved from the 1980s.\\" Officer Minor Jimenez, who was the senior lead police officer in the Pacoima area in 1994 and had been for a 3¬Ω year period leading up to 1994, said that the community involvement was the main reason for the decrease in crime because the residents cooperated with the police and \\"the bad guys know it.\\" After the activism in the area occurred, major crime was reduced by 6%. Residents reached an agreement with liquor store owners; the owners decided to erase graffiti on their properties within 24 hours of reaching the agreement. The owners also stopped the sale of individual cold containers of beer to discourage public consumption of alcohol. Williams said \\"The activism appears to have paid off.\\" The resident meetings with Latino gang members resulted in a 143-day consecutive period of no drive by shootings. Culture In 1955 Ed Meagher of the Los Angeles Times said that the \\"hard-working\\" low income families of Pacoima were not \\"indignents or transients\\", but they \\"belong to the community and have a stake in it.\\" In 1955 P.M. Gomez, the owner of a grocery store in Pacoima, said in a Los Angeles Times article that most of the homeowners in Pacoima were not interested in moving to the San Fernando Gardens complex that was then under development, since most of the residents wanted to remain homeowners. A 1966 city planning report criticized Pacoima for lacking civic pride, and that the community had no \\"vital community image, with no apparent nucleus or focal point.\\" In 1994 Timothy Williams of Los Angeles Times said that the fact that Pacoima was \\"free of the overt blight found in other low-income neighborhoods is no accident.\\" Cecila Costas, who was the principal of Maclay Middle School during that year, said that Pacoima was \\"a very poor community, but there's a tremendous amount of pride here. You can be poor, but that doesn't mean you have to grovel or look like you are poor.\\" Williams said that the African-American and Hispanic populations of Pacoima did not always have cordial relations. He added that by 1994 \\"the mood has shifted from conflict to conciliation as the town has become increasingly Latino.\\" Parks and recreation Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, and his wife, Deborah, in Pacoima during the 2010 San Fernando Valley Veterans Day Parade The David M.

It has a generally young age range as well as the highest population density in the Valley. Ethnically, more than half of its population was born abroad, a higher percentage than Los Angeles as a whole. Known as the valley's first planned community after a transition from agriculture to a post-World War II housing boom, it has produced several notable residents. It is now a mixture of single-family homes and low-rise apartment buildings. Panorama City has three high schools, two recreational centers, a senior center, two hospitals and a chamber of commerce. History Former Panorama theater converted for church services, 2008 Panorama City is known as the San Fernando Valley's first planned community. In 1948, it was developed as such by residential developer Fritz B. Burns and industrialist Henry J. Kaiser. The master plan was created by architectural firm Wurdeman & Becket. Burns, seeing the tremendous potential fortune that could be made as large numbers of World War II veterans came home and started families, teamed up with Kaiser in 1945 to form Kaiser Community Homes. The vast majority of the houses were bought with loans issued by the Federal Housing Administration or the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, better known as the G.I. Bill. Homes in the area were sold with racially discriminatory covenants. A \\"Conditions, Covenants, Restrictions\\" document filed with the county recorder declared that no Panorama City lot could be \\"used or occupied by any person whose blood is not entirely that of the white or Caucasian race.\\" Such restrictive covenants, which sometimes also limited ownership to people \\"of the Christian faith,\\" were then common in many communities at the time. Although rendered legally unenforceable by the Civil Rights Act of 1968, they may still be found on some older property deeds. De facto integration was accelerated by the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977. The CRA-insured credit was provided to the entire community without regard to race or income, causing white flight as with many other areas of the San Fernando Valley. During the period of desegregation busing, Panorama City was exempted due to its diversity. In its history, Panorama City was once adjacent to General Motors' largest assembly plant to date. Today, the Van Nuys Assembly plant has been replaced with a large shopping center named The Plant, which includes stores and restaurants such as Regency Theatres, Ross, Babies \\"R\\" Us, The Home Depot, Hometown Buffet, Blaze Pizza, In-N-Out Burger, Starbucks Coffee and others.  Geography  Panorama City touches Mission Hills on the north, Arleta on the northeast, Sun Valley on the east, Valley Glen on the southeast, Van Nuys on the south and North Hills on the west. For the most part, the community is a mixture of small single-family homes and low-rise apartment buildings. Demographics The 2010 U.S. census counted 69,817 residents in the neighborhood‚Äôs 91402 ZIP code. The median age was 30.1, and the median yearly household income at that time was USD$41,467. In 2008, the Los Angeles Times Mapping L.A. project described Panorama City as an area that was \\"moderately diverse\\" ethnically, with a high percentage of Latinos and a significant population of Filipinos. Filipinos and Mexicans were the most common ancestries in the neighborhood. At that time, the breakdown was Latinos, 70.1%; whites, 11.5%; Asians, 11.9%; blacks, 4.3%; and others, 2.2%. Mexico (52.1%) and El Salvador (13.4%) were the most common places of birth for the 55.0% of the residents who were born outside of the United States‚Äîa high percentage for Los Angeles. As of the 2010 census, renters were occupying 64.8% of the housing stock, while owners held 35.2%. There were 2,849 families headed by single parents. The rate of 20.2% was considered to be a high one. There were 1,837 veterans, or 4.3% of the population, a low percentage compared to the rest of the city and county.

At the time, this small complex included The Broadway and five other stores. Three other major department stores ‚Äî Ohrbachs, J. W. Robinson's and Montgomery Ward ‚Äì opened nearby over the next ten years, and they were marketed collectively as the Panorama City Shopping Center. By the 1970s, the area had lost business to nearby communities. The freestanding Ohrbach's building, designed by the architectural firm Welton Becket and Associates, is significant in that it represents \\"an early and important phase of commercial development\\" in the neighborhood. It is now the site of the Valley Indoor Swap Meet. The Panorama Mall remains an important local mall, with a Walmart and Curacao discount stores, the latter catering to the Hispanic market. Education Thirteen percent of Panorama City residents aged 25 and older had earned a four-year degree by 2000, an average percentage for both the city and the county. The percentage of the same-age residents with less than a high school diploma was high for the county.Less Than High School Ranking - Mapping L.A. - Los Angeles Times \\"Less Than High School,\\" Mapping L.A., Los Angeles Times] Schools within the Panorama City boundaries are: \\"Panorama City: Schools,\\" Mapping L.A., Los Angeles Times Public Panorama High School * Panorama High School, 8015 Van Nuys Blvd. GreatSchools.com * Liggett Street Elementary School, 9373 Moonbeam Avenue * Primary Academy for Success, elementary, 9075 Willis Avenue * Valor Academy Charter, middle, 8755 Woodman Avenue * Panorama City Elementary School, 8600 Kester Avenue * Chase Street Elementary School, 14041 Chase Street * Vista Middle School, 15040 Roscoe Boulevard * Burton Street Elementary School, 8111 Calhoun Avenue * Cal Burke High School, continuation, 14630 Lanark Street * Ranchito Avenue Elementary School, 7940 Ranchito Avenue * Michelle Obama Elementary School, 8150 Cedros Avenue *Alta California Elementary School, 14839 Rayen St Private St..

A winner of two Pulitzer Prizes, he is a regular CNN contributor and has written an op-ed column for The New York Times since November 2001. Kristof is a self-described progressive. According to The Washington Post, Kristof \\"rewrote opinion journalism\\" with his emphasis on human rights abuses and social injustices, such as human trafficking and the Darfur conflict. Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa has described Kristof as an \\"honorary African\\" for shining a spotlight on neglected conflicts.http://www.achievement.org/summit/2008/ Academy of Achievement Summit 2008 Life and career Kristof was born in Chicago, Illinois, and grew up on a sheep and cherry farm in Yamhill, Oregon. He is the son of Jane Kristof (n√©e McWilliams) and Ladis \\"Kris\\" Kristof (born W≈Çadys≈Çaw Krzysztofowicz), both long-time professors at Portland State University in Portland, Oregon. His father was born of parents with Polish and Armenian ethnicity from Romania in the former Austria-Hungary, and immigrated to the United States after World War II. Kristof graduated from Yamhill Carlton High School, where he was student body president and school newspaper editor, and later became a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Harvard College. At Harvard, he studied government, interned at Portland's The Oregonian and worked on The Harvard Crimson newspaper; \\"Alums recall Kristof as one of the brightest undergraduates on campus,\\" according to a profile in the Crimson. After Harvard, he studied law at Magdalen College, Oxford, as a Rhodes Scholar. He earned his law degree with first-class honors and won an academic prize. Afterward, he studied Arabic in Egypt for the 1983‚Äì84 academic year at The American University in Cairo. He has a number of honorary degrees. After joining The New York Times in 1984, initially covering economics, he served as a Times correspondent in Los Angeles, Hong Kong, Beijing, and Tokyo. He rose to be the associate managing editor of The New York Times, responsible for Sunday editions. His columns have often focused on global health, poverty, and gender issues in the developing world. In particular, since 2004 he has written dozens of columns about Darfur and visited the area 11 times. Kristof resides outside New York City with his wife, Sheryl WuDunn, and their three children: Gregory, Geoffrey, and Caroline. Kristof's biography says he has traveled to more than 150 countries. Jeffrey Toobin of CNN and The New Yorker, a Harvard classmate, has said: \\"I'm not surprised to see him emerge as the moral conscience of our generation of journalists. I am surprised to see him as the Indiana Jones of our generation of journalists.\\"Daniel J.T. Schuker, \\"Nicholas Kristof,\\" The Harvard Crimson, June 5, 2006 Bill Clinton said in September 2009: \\"There is no one in journalism, anywhere in the United States at least, who has done anything like the work he has done to figure out how poor people are actually living around the world, and what their potential is. ... So every American citizen who cares about this should be profoundly grateful that someone in our press establishment cares enough about this to haul himself all around the world to figure out what's going on. ... I am personally in his debt, as are we all.\\" Kristof was a member of the board of overseers of Harvard University, where he was chief marshal of commencement for his 25th reunion, and is a member of the board of trustees of the Association of American Rhodes Scholars. Joyce Barnathan, president of the International Center for Journalists, said in a 2013 statement: \\"Nick Kristof is the conscience of international journalism.\\" The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation says that a page one article by Kristof in January 1997 about child mortality in the developing world helped direct the couple -- (Bill and Melinda Gates) -- toward global health as a focus of philanthropy. A framed copy of that article is in the gallery of the Gates Foundation. Kristof has continued to write often about human rights and social justice. In 2020 Darren Walker of the Ford Foundation described Kristof as \\"journalism‚Äôs North Star on issues of poverty, dignity and justice.\\" Between 2010 and 2018 Kristof wrote three articles about Kevin Cooper, a man who had been sentenced to death for murdering a family in California. In these articles Kristof made the case that Cooper had been framed by a racist Sheriff's department and that the true killer was a white contract killer named Lee Furrow. After the third article Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein both called for a second round of DNA testing to clarify whether Cooper had been framed. Seven months after the article was published, departing Governor Jerry Brown authorized limited retesting to settle the issue; the testing is still ongoing. Prizes In 1990, Kristof and his wife, Sheryl WuDunn, earned a Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting for their reporting on the pro-democracy student movement and the related Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. They were the first married couple to win a Pulitzer for journalism. Kristof has also received the George Polk Award and an award from the Overseas Press Club for his reporting which focuses on human rights and environmental issues. Kristof was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary in 2004 and again in 2005 \\"for his powerful columns that portrayed suffering among the developing world's often forgotten people and stirred action.\\" In 2006 Kristof won his second Pulitzer, the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary \\"for his graphic, deeply reported columns that, at personal risk, focused attention on genocide in Darfur and that gave voice to the voiceless in other parts of the world.\\" Kristof was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize again in 2012 and 2016; altogether, he has been a Pulitzer finalist seven times. In 2008, Kristof received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 2009, Kristof and WuDunn received the Dayton Literary Peace Prize's 2009 Lifetime Achievement Award. Together, they also received the 2009 World of Children Lifetime Achievement Award. He has also won the 2008 Anne Frank Award, the 2007 Fred Cuny Award for Prevention of Deadly Conflict, and the 2013 Advancing Global Health Award (from Seattle Biomed). Commentators have occasionally suggested Kristof for the Nobel Peace Prize, but when Media Web named Kristof its \\"print journalist of the year\\" in 2006 and asked him about that, it quoted him as saying: \\"I can't imagine it going to a scribbler like me. That's a total flight of fancy.\\"Jon Friedman, \\"Kristof is Media Web's Print Journalist of the Year,\\" December 1, 2006. In 2011, Kristof was named one of seven \\"Top American Leaders\\" by the Harvard Kennedy School and The Washington Post. \\"His writing has reshaped the field of opinion journalism,\\" The Washington Post explained in granting the award. Earlier, in 2007, U.S. News & World Report named Kristof one of \\"America's Best Leaders.\\" In 2013, Kristof was awarded the Goldsmith Award for Career Excellence in Journalism by Harvard University. Alex Jones, the Pulitzer Prize-winning director of Harvard Kennedy School of Government's Shorenstein Center, declared in presenting the award that \\"the reporter who's done more than any other to change the world is Nick Kristof.\\" In the same year, Kristof was named an International Freedom Conductor by the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center, largely for his work exposing human trafficking and linking it to modern slavery. The last person named to receive the title, two years earlier, was the Dalai Lama. Books Kristof's books, all best-sellers and all co-authored with his wife Sheryl WuDunn, include China Wakes: The Struggle for the Soul of a Rising Power (1994), Thunder from the East: Portrait of a Rising Asia (1999), Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide (Knopf, September 2009),Half the Sky website, http://www.halftheskymovement.org A Path Appears: Transforming Lives, Creating Opportunity (2014) and Tightrope: Americans Reaching for Hope (Knopf, January 2020). A feature documentary for Tightrope was released in 2019. Among many of the motivations for writing Half the Sky Kristof explained to Jane Wales of the World Affairs Council of Northern California that the idea for the book was sparked by the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. After covering the protests, which resulted in some 500 deaths, Kristof and WuDunn were shocked to learn that roughly 39,000 Chinese girls died each year because they were not given the same access to food and medical care as boys. Yet WuDunn and Kristof could not find coverage of these deaths, even though they were far more numerous than the casualties at Tiananmen Square. That led them to dig deeper into questions of gender, Kristof said.Wales interviews Kristof at an International Museum of Women event, October 14, 2009 . Half the Sky covers topics such as sex trafficking and forced prostitution, contemporary slavery, gender-based violence, and rape as a weapon of war and method of justice, as it shines light on the multitude of ways women are oppressed and violated in the world. Half the Sky reached No. 1 on the best-seller lists. Carolyn See, a book critic of The Washington Post, said in her review: \\"Half the Sky is a call to arms, a call for help, a call for contributions, but also a call for volunteers. It asks us to open our eyes to this enormous humanitarian issue. It does so with exquisitely crafted prose and sensationally interesting material. ... I really do think this is one of the most important books I have ever reviewed.\\" Carolyn See review of Half the Sky . In Cleveland, a reviewer for The Plain Dealer said: \\"As Rachel Carson's \\"Silent Spring\\" once catalyzed us to save our birds and be better stewards of our earth, 'Half the Sky' stands to become a classic, spurring us to spare impoverished women these terrors, and elevate them to turn around the future of their nations.\\"Plain Dealer review of Half the Sky . The Seattle Times review predicted that Half the Sky may \\"ignite a grass-roots revolution like the one that eliminated slavery.\\"Seattle Times review of Half the Sky, September 13, 2009 . In CounterPunch, Charles R. Larson declared: \\"Half the Sky is the most important book that I have read since Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, published in 1962. I am not alone in saying that this is the most significant book that I have ever reviewed.\\"CounterPunch review of Half the Sky, September 25, 2009 . Opinion and stances=Iraq War In a column published on August 27, 2002, in a column titled \\"Wimps on Iraq,\\" wrote \\"To us the existing Iraq debate seems largely beside the point; the real issue isn't whether we want to overthrow Saddam, but what price we would have to pay to get the job done.\\" In the same column, he wrote, \\"President Bush has convinced me that there is no philosophical reason we should not overthrow the Iraqi government, given that Iraqis themselves would be better off, along with the rest of the world. But Mr. Bush has not overcome some practical concerns about an invasion.\\" He concludes, after detailing five practical concerns about invading Iraq, \\"So if Mr. Bush were really addressing these concerns, weighing them and then concluding that on balance it's worth an invasion, I'd be reassured. But instead it looks as if the president, intoxicated by moral clarity, has decided that whatever the cost, whatever the risks, he will invade Iraq.\\" In a column titled \\"The Day After\\" in September 2002, Kristof wrote, \\"In one Shiite city after another, expect battles between rebels and army units, periodic calls for an Iranian-style theocracy, and perhaps a drift toward civil war. For the last few days, I've been traveling in these Shiite cities‚ÄîKarbala, Najaf and Basra‚Äîand the tension in the bazaars is thicker than the dust behind the donkey carts. So before we rush into Iraq, we need to think through what we will do the morning after Saddam is toppled. Do we send in troops to try to seize the mortars and machine guns from the warring factions? Or do we run from civil war, and risk letting Iran cultivate its own puppet regime?\\" In another column published on January 28, 2003, he wrote: \\"There's no moral tenet that makes me oppose invasion. If we were confident that we could oust Saddam with minimal casualties and quickly establish a democratic Iraq, then that would be fine -- and such a happy scenario is conceivable. But it's a mistake to invade countries based on best-case scenarios.\\" In the same article, Kristof wrote, \\"Will we be safer if we invade? The real answer is that we don't know. But it's quite plausible that an invasion will increase the danger to us, not lessen it.\\" Kristof continues in this column, \\"Frankly, it seems a bad idea to sacrifice our troops' lives -- along with billions of dollars -- in a way that may add to our vulnerability.\\" Kristof was criticized at the time for reporting that Iraqis opposed an American invasion. In 2018 on the 15th anniversary of the war, Andrew Sullivan apologized to Kristof in a tweet for criticizing him in 2002 for opposing the war. On May 6, 2003, less than two months into the war, Kristof published an op-ed column titled \\"Missing in Action: Truth,\\" in which he questioned whether the intelligence gathered by the Bush administration, which purportedly indicated that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, was either faked or manipulated. In this article, Kristof cited as his source a \\"former ambassador\\" who had traveled to Niger in early 2002 and reported back to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the State Department that the uranium \\"allegations were unequivocally wrong and based on forged documents.\\" Kristof added, \\"The envoy's debunking of the forgery was passed around the administration and seemed to be accepted‚Äîexcept that President Bush and the State Department kept citing it anyway.\\" Two months later, former Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV came forward publicly and published a now-famous op-ed in The New York Times titled \\"What I Didn't Find in Africa\\". This set off a series of events which resulted in what become known as \\"Plamegate\\": the disclosure by journalist Robert Novak of the ‚Äì until then covert ‚Äì status as a CIA officer of Wilson's wife, Valerie Plame Wilson. A criminal investigation was launched as to the source of the leak, as a consequence of which I. Lewis Libby, then-Chief of Staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, was indicted on obstruction of justice, false statement, and perjury charges, and subsequently convicted and sentenced to 30 months in federal prison and a $250,000 fine (though he never served time in prison because President Bush commuted his prison sentence). Kristof's May 6 article was mentioned in the federal indictment of Scooter Libby as a key point in time, and a contributing factor that caused Libby to inquire about the identity of the \\"envoy\\" and later divulge the secret identity of his wife to reporters. \\"Grand bargain\\" with Iran Kristof published several articles criticizing the missed opportunity of the \\"grand bargain,\\" a proposal by Iran to normalize relations with the United States, implement procedures to assure the US it will not develop nuclear weapons, deny any monetary support to Palestinian resistance groups until they agree to stop targeting civilians, support the Arab Peace Initiative, and ensure full transparency to assuage any United States concerns. In return, the Iranians demanded abolition of sanctions and a US statement that Iran does not belong in the so-called \\"Axis of Evil.\\" In his columns, Kristof revealed the documents detailing the proposal and argued that the \\"grand bargain\\" proposal was killed by hardliners in the Bush administration. According to Kristof, that was an \\"appalling mistake\\" since \\"the Iranian proposal was promising and certainly should have been followed up. It seems diplomatic mismanagement of the highest order for the Bush administration to have rejected that process out of hand, and now to be instead beating the drums of war and considering air strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.\\" Kristof further believes that even if the grand bargain is not currently feasible, there is still an option for what he calls a \\"mini- bargain,\\" a more modest proposal for normalizing U.S.-Iranian relations. Anthrax attacks columns On October 12, 2001, Times reporter Judith Miller became one of several victims of alleged anthrax attacks.David Barstow (Oct. 13, 2001), l \\"A NATION CHALLENGED: THE INCIDENTS; Anthrax Found in NBC News Aide\\" , The New York TimesJudith Miller (Oct. 14, 2001), \\"A NATION CHALLENGED: THE LETTER; Fear Hits Newsroom In a Cloud of Powder\\" , The New York Times The book Germs: Biological Weapons and America's Secret War, which Miller had co-written with two other Times staffers, had been published ten days earlier on October 2. It became a top New York Times bestseller a few weeks later. Its cover art depicted a white envelope like those used in the anthrax incidents. The text, written before the September 11 attacks, made reference to jihadist terrorists. In 2002, Kristof wrote a series of columnsNicholas Kristof (Jan. 4, 2002), \\"Profile of A Killer\\" , The New York TimesNicholas Kristof (May 24, 2002), \\"Connecting Deadly Dots\\" , The New York Times indirectly suggesting that Steven Hatfill, a former U.S. Army germ- warfare researcher named as a \\"person of interest\\" by the FBI might be a \\"likely culprit\\"Nicholas Kristof (July 2, 2002), \\"Anthrax?

Yawns\\" , The New York TimesNicholas Kristof (July 12, 2002), \\"The Anthrax Files\\" , The New York Times in the anthrax attacks.Nicholas Kristof (July 19, 2002), \\"Case of the Missing Anthrax\\", The New York TimesNicholas Kristof (Aug. 13, 2002), \\"The Anthrax Files\\" , The New York Times Dr. Hatfill was never charged with any crime. In July 2004, Dr. Hatfill sued the Times and Kristof for libel, claiming defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Subsequently, Dr. Hatfill voluntarily dismissed Kristof as a defendant in the case when it became clear that the U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va., lacked personal jurisdiction over Kristof. The suit continued against the Times itself, but was dismissed in 2004 on the basis that allegations within Kristof's articles did not constitute defamation, albeit they appeared untrue. The appeals court reversed the lower court ruling in 2005, reinstating Dr. Hatfill's suit against the Times.\\"Steven J. Hatfill v. The New York Times Company, and Nicholas Kristof, 416 F.3d 320\\" , CourtListener.com Then in January 2007, presiding judge Claude M. Hilton again dismissed the suit, ruling that Kristof's anthrax articles were \\"cautiously worded\\" and asserted that the scientist may perhaps be innocent. Judge Hilton wrote that Kristof \\"made efforts to avoid implicating his guilt\\" and that \\"Mr. Kristof reminded readers to assume plaintiff's innocence.\\" Kristof praised dismissal of the suit, commenting that he was \\"really pleased that the judge recognized the importance of this kind of reporting\\" and that it was \\"terrific to have a judgment that protects journalism at a time when the press has had a fair number of rulings against it.\\" After the case was dismissed in 2007, the dismissal was upheld by the appeals court. In 2008, the case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court which refused to grant certiorari in the case, effectively leaving the appeals court decision in place. The basis for the dismissal was that Dr. Hatfill was a \\"public figure\\" and he had not proved malice on the part of the Times.Kathleen Cullinan (Dec. 15, 2008), \\"Supreme Court won't hear Hatfill's libel suit\\" , Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press Sudan and Darfur Kristof is particularly well known for his reporting on Sudan. At the beginning of 2004, he was among the first reporters to visit Darfur and describe \\"the most vicious ethnic cleansing you've never heard of.\\" He recounted what he called \\"a campaign of murder, rape and pillage by Sudan,\\" and he was among the first to call it genocide. His biography says he has made 11 trips to the region, some illegally by sneaking in from Chad, and on at least one occasion he was detained at a checkpoint when the authorities seized his interpreter and Kristof refused to leave him behind. Kristof's reporting from Sudan has been both praised and criticized. Robert DeVecchi, past president of the International Rescue Committee, told the Council on Foreign Relations: \\"Nicholas Kristof ... had an unprecedented impact in single-handedly mobilizing world attention to this crisis. There are undoubtedly hundreds of thousands of refugees in and from the Darfur region who owe their very lives to this formidable humanitarian and journalist.\\"Robert DeVecchi, introduction to Nicholas Kristof, Council on Foreign Relations, April 2004 New York Magazine said that Kristof \\"single- handedly focused the world's attention on Darfur,\\"\\"The Influentials: Media, New York, May 8, 2006 and the Save Darfur Coalition said that \\"he is the person most responsible for getting this issue into America's consciousness and the resulting efforts to resolve it.\\"Save Darfur Coalition statement by David Rubenstein, April 18, 2006 Samantha Power, the author of A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide, the Pulitzer Prize-winning book on genocide, told an American Jewish World Service audience that Kristof was probably the person the Janjaweed militia in Darfur most wanted to kill. In June 2008, the actress Mia Farrow spoke as Kristof was honored with the Anne Frank Award, declaring: \\"Nick Kristof was one of the first to publicly insist that the words Never Again mean something for the people of Darfur. For his courage and his conviction in telling tell searing truths, he is the voice of our collective conscience, demanding we bear witness to the first genocide of the 21st century and encouraging us not to sit by while innocents die. Every once in a great while a moral giant appears among us. Nicholas Kristof is that person.\\" For his coverage of Darfur, Ann Curry of NBC suggested that Kristof was \\"the modern journalist who showed courage and leadership comparable to the great Edward R. Murrow.\\" On the other hand, some commentators have criticized Kristof for focusing on atrocities by Arab militias in Darfur and downplaying atrocities by non-Arab militias. A book by Mahmood Mamdani of Columbia University, \\"Saviors and Survivors,\\" criticized Kristof's reporting for over- simplifying a complex historically-rooted conflict and packaging it as \\"genocide.\\" Others, including some critical of Sudan, have sometimes made similar arguments. Sudan's government has also objected that Kristof's reporting exaggerates the scale of suffering and ignores the nuances of tribal conflicts in Darfur. The Sudan government and pro-government news media criticized him in March 2012 for sneaking into Sudan's Nuba Mountains region without a visa, to report on hunger and bombings there, saying that his illegal entry was \\"shameful and improper.\\" Criticism of the anti-sweatshop movement Nicholas Kristof argues that sweatshops are, if not a good thing, then defensible as a way for workers to improve their lives and for impoverished countries to transform themselves into industrial economies. In this argument, sweatshops are an unpleasant but necessary stage in industrial development. Kristof is critical of the way \\"well-meaning American university students regularly campaign against sweatshops\\", particularly the Anti- sweatshop movement's strategy of encouraging consumer boycotts against sweatshop-produced imports. Kristof and WuDunn counter that the sweatshop model is a primary reason why Taiwan and South Korea‚Äîwhich accepted sweatshops as the price of development‚Äîare today modern countries with low rates of infant mortality and high levels of education, while India‚Äîwhich generally has resisted sweatshops‚Äîsuffers from a high rate of infant mortality. Kristof and WuDunn admit that sweatshop labor is grueling and dangerous but argue that it is an improvement over most alternatives in extremely poor countries, providing much-needed jobs and boosting economies. They caution that anti- sweatshop boycott campaigns could lead to the closing down of manufacturing and processing plants in places like Africa where they are needed most. \\"This is not to praise sweatshops,\\" they admit: > Some managers are brutal in the way they house workers in firetraps, expose > children to dangerous chemicals, deny bathroom breaks, demand sexual favors, > force people to work double shifts or dismiss anyone who tries to organize a > union. Agitation for improved safety conditions can be helpful, just as it > was in 19th-century Europe. But Asian workers would be aghast at the idea of > American consumers boycotting certain toys or clothing in protest. The > simplest way to help the poorest Asians would be to buy more from > sweatshops, not less.  Palestinian‚ÄìIsraeli conflict  Kristof supports Israeli and U.S. negotiation with Hamas as a means to resolve the Palestinian‚ÄìIsraeli conflict. He criticizes Israel for what he views as collective punishment of Gazans and holds that the lack of negotiations only strengthens extremists.Strengthening Extremists by Nicholas D. Kristof, The New York Times, June 19, 2008. He also advocates removing Israeli settlements from Hebron since \\"the financial cost is mind-boggling, and the diplomatic cost is greater \\". Kristof contrasts \\"two Israels\\": an oppressive security state in the Palestinian territories and a \\"paragon of justice, decency, fairness ‚Äì and peace,\\" in the work of Israeli human rights activists, journalists, and jurists.The Two Israels by Nicholas D. Kristof, The New York Times, June 22, 2008.  Libya  During the 2011 Libyan civil war, Kristof wrote that the U.S. should create a no-fly zone and also use military aircraft to jam Libyan state communications. He remarked, \\"let's remember the risks of inaction ‚Äì and not psych ourselves out. For crying out loud!\\"  U.S. Government  In a column published in the New York Times on June 15, 2011 Kristof argued that the United States military was a prime example of how a comprehensive social safety net, universal health care, a commitment to public service, low income disparity, and structured planning could be made to work within an organization. He then suggested that the military could serve as a model for improving American society along those lines. This brought criticism from several other commentators, who argued that the military is only effective at what it does by severely limiting the freedom of its members. Jonah Goldberg argued that \\"You've got to love how a system that requires total loyalty, curbs free speech, free association, freedom of movement, etc., is now either 'lefty' or 'liberal' because it gives 'free' healthcare and daycare,\\" and hinted that the ideas in Kristof's column resembled fascism. David French added that \\"If you want to see the military do what it does best, then ride out on a mission with an armored cavalry squadron. If you want to see the military struggle to do its job well, then I suggest you spend some time with its social services.\\"  Education reform  In a 2011 New York Times op-ed, Kristof wrote that he is \\"not a fan\\" of teachers' unions because he maintains that unions encourage teachers to accept low wages in return for job security (future seniority benefits, pensions, and protection from arbitrary dismissal). He feels that such protections have the effect of protecting bad teachers, who then have to be fired for cause ‚Äì a time-consuming, drawn out process ‚Äì rather than being subject to being summarily fired at will.Teaching is predominantly female occupation world wide and in the US. See, for example C. Emily Feistritzer, \\"Profile of Teachers in the US, 2011\\", published on the website of the National Center for Educational Information. Teachers' unions were typically initially organized around the issue of combating discrimination against, and summary dismissal of pregnant teachers. Instead, Kristof advocates that teachers give up these rights and protections in exchange for receiving much higher average starting salaries. He suggests that instead of the current figure of $39,000 for teacher starting salaries, entering teaching salaries start at $65,000, a figure which he believes will have the effect of attracting and retaining more talented individuals to the profession. Flame retardants and chemical reform Kristof has written several articles on the controversial use of flame retardants in furniture, most recently in a November 2013 piece titled \\"Danger Lurks in that Mickey Mouse Couch.\\" Kristof argues that legislative mandates of flame retardants in furniture are a result of powerfully influential lobbyists representing the chemical industry. He claims that flame retardants are ineffective in saving lives, yet pose an increasingly evident public health risk, to both families and firefighters. In his words, \\"These flame retardants represent a dizzying corporate scandal. It's a story of corporate greed, deceit and skulduggery.\\" In 2012, Kristof went as far as to write that flame retardants in furniture are \\"a case study of everything that is wrong with money politics.\\" He concluded that article, \\"Are You Safe On That Sofa?\\" by arguing that the United States needs not only safer couches but also a political system less distorted by what he calls \\"toxic money.\\" Kristof's stances on flame retardants have come under fire from the chemical industry, who call his opeds \\"overdramatic\\" and \\"misleading.\\" Win-a-Trip with Nick Kristof contest In 2006, The New York Times launched the Win a Trip with Nick Kristof contest, offering a college student the opportunity to win a reporting trip to Africa with Kristof by submitting essays outlining what they intend to accomplish in such a trip. From among 3,800 students who submitted entries, Kristof chose Casey Parks of Jackson, Mississippi. In September 2006, Kristof and Parks traveled to Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon, and the Central African Republic and reported on AIDS, poverty, and maternal mortality. During the trip, Kristof published his New York Times columns while Parks wrote about her observations in her blog. The success of this partnership prompted the Times to hold the Second Annual Win A Trip with Nick Kristof contest in 2007. Leana Wen, a medical student at Washington University in St. Louis, and Will Okun, a teacher at Westside Alternative High School in Chicago, were the winners of the 2007 competition. During summer 2007, they traveled with Kristof to Rwanda, Burundi, and eastern Congo. Filmmaker Eric Daniel Metzgar joined Kristof, Wen and Okun on their trip. The resulting film, Reporter, premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival and aired on HBO in February 2010. In reviewing the film, which was executive produced by Ben Affleck, Entertainment Weekly wrote: \\"In Reporter, he's a compelling figure, a cross between Mother Teresa and the James Woods character in Salvador, and what seals the intensity of his job is the danger.\\"Owen Gleiberman, \\"Sundance: Sneaky Soderbergh, and chasing the buzz,\\" Entertainment Weekly, January 21, 2009 The Washington Post observed, \\"Ideally, [Kristof] hopes to teach his companions, who won a contest to travel with him, about the value of witnessing the world's atrocities and scintillating them into stories that will call on people to act. Which is what Kristof did with his work in Darfur, Sudan: He caused people ‚Äì from George Clooney on down ‚Äì to do whatever they can.\\" Since 2010, the Center for Global Development has screened applicants for the contest, forwarding Kristof a short list of finalists for his selection. In March 2018 Kristof traveled again to the Central African Republic accompanied by Tyler Pager, the former editor of The Daily Northwestern and the winner of that year's contest. The co-director of Columbia University's Human Rights Institute, Sarah Knuckey, described Kristof's reporting of the Central African Republic resulting from this trip as \\"shallow\\" and \\"reckless\\".

History Stone house built in 1925 The former Tongva/Fernande√±o (Native American) village in this area was called Wix√°nga, which comes from the word wix√°r (or \\"thorn\\" or \\"prickle\\" in English) in the Fernande√±o dialect of the Tongva language. Hence, Wix√°nga meant something like \\"place/canyon of the thorns\\" in English, in reference to the abundant prickly pear cacti naturally found in the area. This was later reflected in the Spanish name for the area, or Ca√±ada de las Tunas (\\"canyon of the thorns\\" in English). Finally, this became La Tuna Canyon, and now Sun Valley. In 1874, California State Senator Charles Maclay (for whom Maclay Street in San Fernando is named) acquired 56,000 acres (230 km2) of land across the San Fernando Valley. The area extended from Sunland Blvd. all the way west to the Chatsworth Hills. East of Sunland was Rancho San Rafael, a large land grant to Jos√© Mar√≠a Verdugo by the Spanish Crown. By 1876, the Southern Pacific Railroad was constructed through the eastern San Fernando Valley, linking Southern and Northern California. A general store named Roberts Store was used as a post office and water-tank station; later the area's name was changed to Roscoe, reportedly after the name of a railroad crew member. The current name of Sun Valley was chosen in 1950 by residents.Ira Gribin, \\"Sun Valley Once Known as Roberts Store, Roscoe\\", May 10, 1981, page VB1 (image 679)Sun Valley Portrait, Los Angeles Times, July 14, 1996 Old Trapper's Lodge Old Trapper's Lodge, California Historical Landmark No. 939, an outsider art environment that pays homage to the pioneer upbringing of its creator, John Ehn (1897‚Äì1981), was situated in Sun Valley.

She was the lead ship of the Pensacola class, which the navy classified from 1931 as heavy cruisers. The third Navy ship to be named after the city of Pensacola, Florida, she was nicknamed the \\"Grey Ghost\\" by Tokyo Rose. She received 13 battle stars for her service. She was laid down by the New York Navy Yard on 27 October 1926, launched on 25 April 1929, sponsored by Mrs. Joseph L. Seligman, and commissioned on 6 February 1930, Captain Alfred G. Howe in command.  Service history = Inter-war period  Pensacola departed New York on 24 March 1930, and transited the Panama Canal to Callao, Peru, and Valpara√≠so, Chile, before returning to New York on 5 June. For the next four years she operated along the eastern seaboard and in the Caribbean Sea, several times transiting the Panama Canal for combined Fleet battle practice ranging from California to Hawaii. Originally CL-24, effective 1 July 1931, Pensacola was redesignated CA-24 in accordance with the provisions of the London Naval Treaty of 1930. Pensacola departed Norfolk on 15 January 1935, to join the Pacific Fleet arriving San Diego, her new home port, on 30 January. Fleet problems ranged to Hawaii, one cruise took her to Alaska, and combined fleet maneuvers returned her briefly to the Caribbean Sea before she sailed on 5 October 1939 to base at Pearl Harbor, arriving on the 12th. Pensacola was one of six ships to receive the new RCA CXAM radar in 1940. Maneuvers frequently found the cruiser off Midway and French Frigate Shoals, and she made one voyage to Guam.  World War II  1941‚Äì1942 = Pensacola departed Pearl Harbor on 29 November 1941, with the so-called \\"Pensacola Convoy\\", bound for Manila, in the Philippines. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the convoy was diverted to Australia, entering Brisbane harbor on 22 December. Pensacola returned to Pearl Harbor on 19 January 1942, and put to sea on 5 February to patrol the approaches to the Samoan Islands. On 17 February 1942, she rendezvoused off Samoa with Carrier Task Force 11 (TF 11), built around . Near Bougainville Island, Pensacolas gunners helped repel two waves of Japanese bombers on 20 February. No ships were damaged. Anti-aircraft fire and Lexington Combat Air Patrol planes shot down 17 of the 18 attackers. Pensacola continued to help guard Lexington on offensive patrol in the Coral Sea until joined the task force on 6 March. The American ships steamed for the Gulf of Papua where‚Äîon 10 March‚ÄîLexington launched planes for a surprise strike over the Owen Stanley Mountains at Japanese shipping and installations at Salamaua and Lae. A complete surprise, the raid caused heavy damage. The task force then turned toward Noum√©a, New Caledonia, to replenish. Pensacola patrolled with Yorktowns task force until 8 April, then headed, via Samoa, for Pearl Harbor, arriving on 21 April. She carried Marine Fighting Squadron 212 (VMF-212) to Efate in the New Hebrides Islands and returned to Pearl Harbor with on 26 May. Pensacola departed Pearl Harbor on 28 May with the Enterprise task force for a rendezvous on 2 June northeast of Midway with units of TF 17. Two days later, when the Japanese armada came within range of the American carriers, the battle of Midway commenced. Admiral Spruance's torpedo planes and dive-bombers attacked the Japanese carriers. and went up in flames, and was badly damaged. A fourth enemy carrier‚Äî, still at large‚Äîlaunched strikes at Yorktown and the American flattops struck back, leaving the enemy carrier hit many times, in a mass of flames. Meanwhile, Yorktown‚Äîhit by three bombs‚Äîwas fighting for her life. Pensacola raced from Enterprise‚Ä≤s screen to aid the stricken carrier. While trying to assist Yorktown, the ship was struck with a torpedo and hit in the galley. Yorktown was dead in the water when Pensacola arrived, and the cruiser assisted in shooting down four enemy torpedo bombers during a second attack. Despite all that could be done, Yorktown received two torpedo hits amidships and had to be abandoned. Pensacola rejoined the screen of Enterprise to pursue the retiring Japanese. Pensacola returned to Pearl Harbor on 13 June and‚Äîwith Enterprise‚Äîagain put to sea on 22 June, carrying 1,157 marines of Marine Aircraft Group 22 (MAG 22) to Midway. She patrolled and trained in Hawaiian waters until 7 August. As Marines stormed the shores of Guadalcanal, the cruiser set course for the Solomons in the screen of , and to support the leathernecks in that bitter campaign. In submarine-infested waters, torpedoes damaged Saratoga on 31 August and sank Wasp on 15 September. Pensacola arrived at Noum√©a, New Caledonia on 26 September, and departed with Hornet on 2 October to strike the enemy in the Santa Isabel‚ÄìGuadalcanal area. On 24 October, Hornet‚Ä≤s task group joined Enterprise and the combined force steamed to intercept enemy warships approaching the Guadalcanal-Tulagi area. On 26 October, search planes located a Japanese carrier and battleship formation, beginning the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands which was fought without contact being made between surface ships of the opposing forces. Air strikes inflicted severe bomb damage to and , and sank . Bomb hits damaged and other enemy ships. Pensacola helped fight off a coordinated dive bombing and torpedo plane raid which damaged Hornet so severely that she had to be abandoned. Within minutes of the attack on Hornet, 24 dive bombers dropped 23 bombs in a run on Enterprise. Despite damage, the famed \\"Fighting Lady\\" launched a large number of planes from Hornet besides her own. Pensacola received 188 survivors from Hornet, whom she debarked at Noum√©a on 30 October 1942. The task force had turned back a Japanese attempt to regain Guadalcanal, sunk Yura, and damaged a number of enemy capital ships. Japanese carriers lost 123 planes. Pensacola departed Noum√©a on 2 November to guard transports landing Marine reinforcements, and supplies, at Aola Bay, Guadalcanal. She helped guard Enterprise during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on 12‚Äì13 November. Planes from Enterprise assisted in the sinking of , one cruiser, three destroyers, and eleven auxiliaries, and the damaging of four cruisers and four destroyers.  Battle of Tassafaronga  Pensacola the day after being heavily damaged off Tassafaronga by a Japanese torpedo. Pensacola returned to Espiritu Santo to join TF 67 under Rear Admiral Carleton H. Wright. On 29 November, TF 67 sailed to intercept a Japanese destroyer-transport force expected off Guadalcanal the next night. Just before midnight of the 30th, the American ships transited Lengo Channel and headed past Henderson Field on Guadalcanal as the Japanese task group steamed on a southerly course west of Savo Island to enter \\"Ironbottom Sound\\". The two opposing task forces clashed in the Battle of Tassafaronga. American destroyers launched torpedoes as the enemy range came within of Pensacola‚Ä≤s cruiser formation.

Pensacola turned left to prevent collision with two damaged American ships ahead of her. Silhouetted by the burning American cruisers, she came into the Japanese line of fire. One of 18 torpedoes launched by Japanese destroyers hit her below the mainmast on the portside. Her engine room flooded, three gun turrets went out of commission, and her oil tanks ruptured to make a soaked torch of her mast. Meantime, maneuvered radically at , her guns continuing their rapid fire as she escaped the trap. The last American cruiser in column‚Äî‚Äîtook two torpedo hits to duplicate on a larger scale the havoc inflicted on Pensacola. The oil-fed flames engulfed Pensacolas main deck aft where ammunition exploded. Only supreme effort and skillful damage control by her men saved the ship. The fire‚Äîpunctuated by the frightful explosion of 8-inch projectiles in her Number 3 turret‚Äîgradually subsided. Pensacola made steady progress toward Tulagi. She arrived there still aflame. After 12 hours the last fire was quenched. Her dead numbered seven officers and 118 men. One officer and 67 men were injured. = 1943‚Äì1945 = Camouflaged as part of the island, Pensacola made repairs in Tulagi Harbor that enabled her to steam to Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides Island. She arrived there on 6 December for emergency repairs by until she sailed on 7 January 1943 via Samoa to Pearl Harbor, arriving on 27 January. Sister ships and Pensacola, with (L to R), at Pearl Harbor in 1943 On 8 November, Pensacola sailed from Pearl Harbor in the screen of Southern Attack Force aircraft carriers. On 19 November, Pensacola made bombardment runs on Betio and Tarawa. She rained 600 projectiles to put coast defense guns out of action, and destroyed enemy beach defenses and numerous buildings. As troops stormed ashore on Tarawa on 20 November, the cruiser screened carriers launching air strikes supporting the landings. That night, she fought off Japanese torpedo bombers and assisted into Funafuti, Ellice Islands. For the next two months, she ranged out of that base to screen carriers covering the movement of reinforcements and supplies to the Gilberts. On 29 January 1944, she began strikes and bombardments to destroy Japanese air power and shipping in the Marshall Islands. That night, Pensacola helped bombard Taroa in the Eastern Marshalls. She then slammed shells into airfield runways, seaplane ramps, ammunition stowage areas and buildings on Wotje. She continued pounding these targets as Marines and Army troops landed on 31 January to seize Kwajalein and Majuro Atolls. The invasion of the Marshall Islands continued on 1 February as Marines occupied Roi and Namur Islands. Pensacola continued to hit hard at Taroa, Maloelap Atoll through 18 February, destroying coastal defenses and air bases of the enemy in the eastern Marshalls. Operating from Majuro and Kwajalein, she continued to patrol in approaches of the Marshalls. She again served in the screen of fast carriers conducting raids in the Caroline Islands (30 March‚Äì1 April), against Japanese defenses at Palau, Yap, Ulithi and Woleai. Pensacola departed Majuro on 25 April sailing via Pearl Harbor and Mare Island for duty in the Northern Pacific, arriving in Kulak Bay on 27 May. On 13 June, she joined her cruiser-destroyer task force in raining destruction on the airfields of Matsuwa, Kuriles. In the early morning of 26 June, she fired 300 8-inch projectiles to destroy shipping, airfields and installations at Kurabu Zaki, Paramushiru To, Kuriles, returning to Kulak Bay on 28 June. Pensacola continued patrol in Alaskan waters until departing Kulak Bay on 8 August for Hawaii. Pensacola arrived Pearl Harbor on 13 August and put to sea on the 29th. En route to the Marianas on 3 September, she joined an air-sea bombardment of Wake Island. On 9 October, she pounded the main radio station and installations on Marcus Island. She and her sister cruisers and destroyers stirred up a fire melee in their \\"impersonation\\" of Halsey's 3rd Fleet to lead the Japanese into thinking the ladder of islands to the Bonins was next on the American timetable for invasion. Meanwhile, Adm. Halsey's units advanced on the Philippines while Fast Carriers rained destruction on the enemy air and Fleet bases at Okinawa and Formosa. Pensacola made rendezvous with the units of the Fast Carrier Task Force retiring from the great air battles over Formosa. After escorting and to Ulithi, she joined a Fast Carrier Task Group‚Äîincluding Wasp‚Äîon 16 October. The following day, troops supported by the 7th Fleet began the liberation of the Philippine Islands. Pensacola screened fast aircraft carriers striking Luzon and directly supported the invasion of Leyte beginning on 20 October. She raced north to aid in the destruction of the enemy carrier force in the battle off Cape Enga√±o on 25 October, then turned south as the fast carriers launched planes to aid the gallant escort carriers. Pensacola bombarded Iwo Jima on the night of 11/12 November and returned to Ulithi the 14th. As she was about to depart for Saipan on 20 November, she spotted a periscope about to starboard. As she maneuvered clear, rammed the enemy. Four minutes later, her men witnessed the flaming explosion that destroyed , victim of a Japanese kaiten midget submarine. Pensacola arrived Saipan on 22 November to prepare for the invasion of Iwo Jima. Five nights later, she helped splash several attacking Japanese aircraft. She departed Saipan on 6 December, plastering Iwo Jima with 500 8-inch projectiles on the 8th. She returned to Iwo Jima on the 24th and 27th, pounding mountain gun positions north of Suribachi Mountain. She hit defenses on Chichi Jima and Haha Jima as well as Iwo Jima on 5 January and 24 January 1945. At Ulithi on 27 January, Pensacola formed with a battleship-cruiser- destroyer gunstrike task force under Rear Admiral B. J. Rodgers. Six battleships, four cruisers and a destroyer screen comprised the bombardment force which sailed on 10 February via Tinian to Iwo Jima. On 16 February, Pensacola opened fire on the northwest sector of Iwo Jima to prepare for the landings. That afternoon, Lieutenant Douglas W. Gandy, USNR‚Äîpiloting one of Pensacolas OS2U Kingfisher floatplanes‚Äîshot down a Japanese fighter. The next morning, Pensacola took six hits from enemy shore batteries as her guns covered operations of the minesweepers close inshore. Three of her officers and 14 men were killed. Another five officers and 114 men were injured. Pensacola fired back as she retired for temporary repairs then returned to her bombardment station. The morning of 19 February she commenced harassing and counter-battery fire in direct support of the invasion landings. Her deadly guns fought day and night into 1 March when she silenced enemy shore batteries which had hit amidships. After helping Terry‚Ä≤s wounded, she resumed direct bombardment support to advancing Marines that continued into 3 March. She arrived in Ulithi on 5 March, and was assigned to Task Force 54 (TF 54). They put to sea on the 20th to support the invasion Okinawa, the \\"last stepping stone\\" to Japan. On 25 March, Pensacola bombarded enemy defenses and covered the operations of minesweepers preparing the way for the Okinawa invasion landings. On 27 March, she spotted a torpedo wake on her port quarter. A second \\"fish\\" streaked toward the ship from dead astern. As her 40 mm gunners opened fire on the torpedoes, Pensacola went hard left then hard right to parallel the deadly missiles. The first torpedo missed her starboard quarter by less than . The second passed some along the port side of the cruiser as her gunners opened with automatic weapons on a submarine periscope. Pensacola gave direct bombardment support to the initial invasion of Okinawa on 1 April and continued to blast at enemy targets until the 15th. She then sailed via Guam and Pearl Harbor for home. She arrived at Mare Island on 7 May for overhaul. She sailed on 3 August for Adak, Alaska, and was there when hostilities ended. On the 31st, she sailed with units of Cruiser Division Five en route to Ominato, Northern Honsh≈´, Japan. She anchored in the outer harbor of Ominato on 8 September.  Post-war  Pensacola departed Ominato on 14 November to embark 200 veterans at Iwo Jima, then touched Pearl Harbor en route to San Francisco, California, arriving on 3 December. Five days later, she put to sea for Apra Harbor, Guam, where she embarked nearly 700 veterans for transport to San Diego, arriving on 9 January 1946. = Operation Crossroads = Pensacola being sunk as a target ship in 1948 Pensacola departed San Pedro on 29 April to stage with units of Joint Task Force One at Pearl Harbor in preparation for Operation Crossroads, the atomic bomb experiments at Bikini Atoll. She stood out of Pearl Harbor on 20 May, and reached Bikini on the 29th to serve as a target ship. She survived the tests of 1 July and 25 July. On 24 August, she was taken in tow for Kwajalein where she decommissioned on 26 August. Her hulk was turned over to the custody of Joint Task Force One for radiological and structural studies. On completion of these studies, her hulk was sunk on 10 November 1948 off the Washington coast.

Adams-class guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy. She was the third Navy ship named for Commodore Joshua Barney USN (1759-1818). Her original designation was DD-956. On 23 April 1957, it was decided to build her as a guided missile destroyer. Barney was laid down by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation at Camden, New Jersey on 10 August 1959, launched on 10 December 1960, sponsored by Mrs. Harry D. Wortman, and commissioned at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 11 August 1962, Comdr. Joseph J. Doak in command. 1960s After outfitting at Philadelphia, the guided missile destroyer put to sea on 27 September to conduct pre-shakedown qualification tests off the Virginia Capes and missile firings at Roosevelt Roads near Puerto Rico. At the conclusion of that mission, she arrived in Norfolk, Virginia, on 8 December and remained there until the end of the year. Barney embarked upon her shakedown cruise on New Year's Day 1963 and returned to Norfolk on 20 February 1963 for availability alongside a destroyer tender before moving north to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in mid-March for a post shakedown overhaul. The guided missile destroyer completed the overhaul on 31 May and began normal operations out of Norfolk with the 2nd Fleet. That fall, she headed for the Mediterranean Sea for a five-month cruise with the 6th Fleet. During that deployment, she made port visits and conducted training operations with units of the 6th Fleet and with ships of Allied navies. The warship returned to Norfolk in March 1964 and resumed operations with the 2d Fleet. In September 1964, she returned to sea to participate in a series of NATO exercises. Those evolutions continued into November when Barney headed back to Norfolk. Type training and 2d Fleet operations carried her into the New Year. On 15 February 1965, she embarked upon her second tour of duty in the Mediterranean. For the next five months, the warship steamed the length and breadth of the \\"middle sea\\" in the screen of a fast carrier task force. She visited a number of ports in France, Italy, and Turkey and participated in a bilateral, American French, anti-submarine warfare (ASW) exercise, Operation \\"Fairgame III.\\" Barney returned to Norfolk on 12 July 1965. Second Fleet operations out of Norfolk kept her busy for the remainder of 1965 and the first two months of 1966. Those evolutions included a tour of duty at Key West, Florida, early in January as school ship for the Fleet Sonar School. On 1 March, Barney entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard to begin her first regular overhaul. Repairs complete, the guided missile destroyer put to sea on 26 September to conduct ship's qualification tests and missile firings. On 7 November, she began a month of post overhaul refresher training out of Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba. Following that, the warship conducted a missile firing exercise on the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Range located near Puerto Rico and a gun shoot at Culebra Island. After a visit to St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands, Barney returned to Norfolk on 19 December and remained in the Hampton Roads area for the rest of 1966. In mid February 1967, the warship departed Norfolk bound for the Far East and her only cruise in the combat zone during the Vietnam War. That deployment lasted almost exactly seven months. On the outbound voyage, she stopped at Mayport, Florida; Guantanamo Bay; the Panama Canal Zone; Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; Midway Island; Guam in the Marianas; and at Subic Bay in the Philippines. While off Vietnam, Barney served in various ways. She performed duty as sea air rescue controller, interdicted Viet Cong seaborne logistics, and shelled targets ashore in both North and South Vietnam. On several occasions, the guided missile destroyer came within range of enemy shore batteries. She suffered no hits, but a member of her crew was wounded, lost his leg, by a shell fragment from a near miss. The warship also visited Hong Kong and ports in the Philippine Islands and in Japan. Reversing her outbound itinerary‚Äîand adding a stop at Okinawa--Barney returned to Norfolk on 19 September 1967 and began a post deployment leave and upkeep period. Following the standdown time, the warship resumed operations along the Atlantic seaboard. That occupation continued until early in March 1968 when Barney departed Norfolk for her third deployment with the 6th Fleet. Exercises and port visits constituted her main fare as they had in the past. The warship concluded her assignment with the 6th Fleet on 12 July when she departed Pollen√ßa Bay, Majorca, to return to Norfolk. She reentered her homeport on 22 July 1968. After completing the usual post-deployment standdown, Barney resumed 2d Fleet operations out of Norfolk. Those operations included the annual winter exercise in the West Indian waters in January 1969 and ASW exercises off the coast of Florida late in February and early in March. She returned to Norfolk on 5 March 1969 to prepare for overseas movement. The guided missile destroyer stood out of Norfolk again on 1 April, bound for European waters. Later that month before Barney joined the 6th Fleet, she participated in a trilateral ASW exercise with American, Spanish, and Portuguese warships. That operation was followed by hunter killer exercises in cooperation with . Between 14 and 22 May, the guided missile destroyer visited Portsmouth, England, for the naval review celebrating the 20th anniversary of NATO. She resumed hunter-killer exercises on 22 May and continued them until 2 June when she entered the Mediterranean. Immediately upon joining the 6th Fleet, Barney took part in a bilateral ASW exercise with other units of the fleet and ships of the French Navy. She then visited several ports before joining in an amphibious exercise conducted at Sardinia early in August. More port visits and a carrier screening exercise followed. Finally, on 28 September, she was relieved by at Pollen√ßa Bay, Majorca. On the 30th, Barney headed back to the United States and arrived in Norfolk on 10 October. The customary leave and upkeep period followed. On 1 December 1969, the guided missile destroyer entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard to begin regular overhaul. 1970s Barney completed repairs in June 1970. After post-repair trials, she departed Norfolk on 7 July for refresher training in the West Indies. That assignment lasted until September when she began missile exercises. Those, however, were cut short by an urgent need for her presence in the eastern Mediterranean in response to the Jordanian crisis that resulted when open fighting erupted between the Jordanian Army and PLO guerillas. Barney departed Norfolk on 23 September and arrived on station with Task Group (TG) 60.1 on 7 October. Built around carrier , TG 60.1‚Äîwith Barney in the screen‚Äîcruised the eastern Mediterranean until the crisis abated early in November. The guided missile destroyer operated with the 6th Fleet for about another month during which time she visited Spanish, Italian, and Maltese ports. On 8 December 1970, she departed Rota, Spain, to return to the United States. She tied up at Norfolk on the 15th and began post deployment and holiday standdown. Resuming normal operations at and out of Norfolk on 15 January 1971, she underwent various efficiency inspections and got underway frequently for multiship exercises, type training, and single ship drills. She remained so occupied through the summer and into the fall. In October, Barney began preparations for another tour of duty with the 6th Fleet. On 1 December, the warship stood out of Norfolk wearing the pennant of the Commander, Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 2. She joined the 6th Fleet at Rota on the 9th and, for the next six months, cruised in the Mediterranean in company with other ships of the 6th Fleet, most frequently in a task group built around John F. Kennedy. The guided missile destroyer visited ports on the European, African, and Middle Eastern shores of the \\"middle sea.\\" She frequently engaged in intelligence surveillance missions directed at Soviet ships in the area. She also participated in at least one bilateral exercise‚Äîwith of the Royal Navy‚Äîas well as in a number of unilateral exercises with other units of the 6th Fleet. On 22 June, she departed the Mediterranean to return home. Barney arrived back in Norfolk on 29 June 1972. After the normal leave and upkeep period, she resumed operations out of Norfolk. It was announced that Barney would be relieving a destroyer currently on operations in Vietnam, with operations to begin in January 1973. However, during the prep period for this deployment, Nixon's \\"Vietnamization\\" plan had begun to be implemented. This had Barney's deployment order 'frozen'. During this 'freeze' period the decision to deploy Barney to Nato force beginning in July 1973 was ordered. This change of deployment orders allowed for the implementation of the power plant conversion from 600 PSI operation to 1200 PSI, and the conversion of fuel from 'black oil' to Navy distillate. Those evolutions continued until 8 November when work began to convert her main propulsion plant to the use of Navy distillate fuel. Barney's fuel conversion lasted until early in the spring of 1973. On 23 April, she got underway from Norfolk for refresher training in the West Indies. The warship returned to Norfolk on 19 May and remained there until 25 June when she got underway to join NATO's Standing Naval Force, Atlantic. Barney arrived at the Royal Navy dockyard, Portsmouth, England, on 6 July and operated with the NATO force in European waters for the next five months. During that period, she participated in three multinational maneuvers. One took her into the Baltic where she shadowed Soviet bloc warships. Another saw her cross the Arctic Circle at zero longitude (acquiring the Blue Nose), while the third took place in the North Sea. While on operations in the area of the Kategat and Skaggerak, between Denmark and Sweden, Barney's propellors struck bottom at a speed of about 21 to 24 knots. Mud and rocks were observed by the fantail watch to be thrown skyward. Engineering called for a full stop, as seawater was flowing into the aft engineroom with some gusto up the port shaft alley. The impact to the portside propellor had broken one leg of the shaft strut from the hull and the ensuing wobble produced in the shaft had the 'packing' on the portside shaft displaced into the engineroom followed by flooding. The 'snipes' did a great job to replace the packing and allow Barney to get back underway, however, speed was limited to a max of 14 knots for the remainder of the deployment. Any attempts at more speed resulted in the shaft packing seal pushing up into the engine room with inevitable flooding. The extent of the damage was unknown to the Captain and crew until a pierside underwater exam complete with live video recording was made in Norfolk (Capt. Corr was standing beside me watching the video). The result of this examination which revealed the extensive damage to both propellors and shafts forced an out of cycle shipyard overhaul, as Barney was unable to be deployed as an effective fighting ship. While finishing the Nato deployment under limited speed restrictions, on 5 December, Barney departed the Nato force and headed back to the United States. She arrived in Norfolk on 17 December 1973 and began the usual post deployment standdown period. It was during this standdown that the divers conducted the pierside inspection which revealed the extent of the damage. She remained at Norfolk through the end of the year and for the first three months of 1974. It was during this period the determination was made to 'jump' Barney ahead of other ships that were due to receive the AN/SQQ-23PAIR sonar retrofit, and conduct the needed major engineering repairs at the same time. On 4 April, she made the short, round trip to Yorktown and back to unload ammunition in preparation for out of cycle overhaul. She stood out of Norfolk on 10 April and arrived at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard the next day. Barney completed her overhaul on 24 February 1975 and arrived back in Norfolk the 26th. She spent the rest of the year operating out of Norfolk, first engaged in post-overhaul refresher training and qualifications and, later, conducting normal Atlantic Fleet operations. That employment carried her into 1976. On 7 July 1976, the guided missile destroyer departed Norfolk bound for the Mediterranean. She reached Rota on 17 July and relieved . For the next six months, she cruised the \\"middle sea\\" making port visits and conducting exercises with other units of the 6th Fleet and with elements of allied navies. On 28 January 1977, Barney departed Leix√µes, Portugal, to return to the United States. She tied up at Norfolk on 7 February and, after two weeks of leave and upkeep, went into the drydock at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for repairs to her sonar dome. The guided missile destroyer completed repairs on 14 April and, after sea trials, resumed normal operations out of Norfolk a week later. Training evolutions and inspections occupied her for the remainder of the year and for the first 10 weeks of 1978. On 16 March 1978, Barney departed Norfolk on her way back to the Mediterranean. After stops at Bermuda and at Ponta Delgada in the Azores, she arrived in Rota on the 27th and joined the 6th Fleet. However, Barney remained in the \\"middle sea\\" only briefly. On 6 April, she transited the Suez Canal and became a unit of the Middle East Force. The warship conducted exercises and made port visits at various East African and Persian Gulf ports over the next four months. She also collected intelligence on Soviet ships operating in the vicinity. On 12 August, she retransited the Suez Canal and briefly rejoined the 6th Fleet. After a stop at Rota on 21 and 22 August, she headed back to the United States and reached Norfolk on 1 September. After three weeks of post deployment leave and upkeep, the guided missile destroyer entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 29 September for a regular overhaul. 1980s The repairs lasted for more than a year. She returned to active duty on 5 November 1979 and for the remainder of that year conducted post overhaul refresher training. Over the next year, she operated along the east coast and in the West Indies training and undergoing inspections. On 18 November 1980, Barney stood out of Norfolk bound for the Mediterranean Sea. She arrived in Rota, Spain on the 29th and joined the 6th Fleet. On 21 December, she transited the Suez Canal once again and joined the Middle East Force. Again, she visited many East African and Persian Gulf ports. That assignment lasted until 22 February 1981 when she departed Bahrain to begin the long voyage home. Steaming via the Suez Canal and performing a short tour of duty with the 6th Fleet en route, Barney arrived back in Norfolk on 9 April. After post deployment leave and upkeep, she resumed 2d Fleet operations out of Norfolk. Three other six-month deployments would occur during the 80's....another Red Sea/Persian Gulf/Indian Ocean Cruise in 84-85. In 1987-1988 Barney embarked on a Med Cruise that involved a stint with other NATO countries in a joint exercise with other NATO ships (including HMS Ambuscade, BMS Molders, TCG Yucitepe and a Spanish, Australian and Canadian ship) and crews. Port visits included stops at: Taranto, Genoa and Naples in Italy - Marseilles, Toulon and Cannes in France - Alexandria, Egypt - Izmir, Turkey - Haifa, Israel - Cagliari, Sardinia - Palermo, Sicily- Barcelona, Spain After this exercise concluded, she then operated as an escort for the USS Coral Sea battle group before returning to her home port in Norfolk. Duties in between deployments included ship yard repair stints, one in Norfolk Naval Shipyard and another extended repair stay at Sparrows Point Shipyard in Dundalk (Baltimore), Md. Afterwards, she conducted a pair of joint Navy/Coast Guard Narcotic Interdiction Ops cruises in the Caribbean, including refresher training in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba in preparation for what would be her final cruise in August 1989. The Barneys final six-month deployment was another 'Med Cruise' in 1989-1990. With several port visits that included Naples, Italy- Cavalier, France- Haifa, Israel- Tunis, Tunisia- Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia- Rota, Spain while a member of the USS Forrestal Carrier Battle Group. Decommissioning and fate Barney was decommissioned on 17 December 1990, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 20 November 1992 and sold for scrap on 15 April 1994. The scrap contract was terminated on 1 October 1996 and the ship was returned to the Navy on 10 February 1999. The ship was resold on 22 February 2006 for dismantling.

The name is also given to a private natural lake fed by the Los Angeles River and maintained by neighboring property owners. The history of Toluca Lake can be traced to the days of the Tongva Indians, followed by Spanish colonization and Mexican independence. Toluca Lake was part of the early rancho system. The original Toluca Lake was divided, with the neighborhood being known as Forman Toluca Ranch. In 1923, investors bought and developed the land as \\"Toluca Lake Park\\". The neighborhood has had notable residents. Ronald and Nancy Reagan held their wedding reception in Toluca Lake. Comedian Bob Hope was a longtime resident of Toluca Lake. More recently, it has been the home of entertainers such as Hilary Duff, Viola Davis, Steve Carell, Miley Cyrus and Melissa McCarthy. Geography=Community The Toluca Lake neighborhood is situated on 1.22 square miles of the southeastern San Fernando Valley. The Mapping L.A. section of the Los Angeles Times website describes it as bounded on the south by Universal City, on the west by Studio City, on the north by North Hollywood and on the east by the city of Burbank. \\"San Fernando Valley,\\" Mapping L.A. The Toluca Lake Chamber of Commerce website states that the district is not only a neighborhood in Los Angeles but that it \\"spills over into Burbank\\" and \\"Political entities and others, such as the Greater Toluca Lake Neighborhood Council each draw their own boundaries to suit specific needs. For example, the Toluca Lake Chamber of Commerce serves the entire community in Burbank and Los Angeles, while the City of Los Angeles considers its neighborhood called Toluca Lake to be entirely within its city boundaries\\" Lake The geologic Toluca Lake is a body of water located near the district‚Äôs southeastern boundaries. The historic natural lake was fed by springs of upwelling groundwater from the Los Angeles River and San Fernando Valley subterranean aquifers. Late 19th and 20th century L. A. DWP well extraction and 1930s concrete river channelization lowered the water table, and currently community wells at the lake‚Äôs edges maintain the water level. The bottom of the lake is surfaced with four inches (102 mm) of asphalt concrete to prevent seepage. Owned by the surrounding homeowners, the lake has been maintained by the Toluca Lake Property Owners Association, a non-profit corporation established in 1934. The lake, encircled by private residences and the Lakeside Golf Club, is completely inaccessible to and hidden from the public. Population The Toluca Lake neighborhood had a population of 7,782 in the 2000 census and an estimated population of 8,563 in 2008. At 6,393 people per square mile, its density was among the lowest in the city of Los Angeles. According to the Los Angeles Times, its percentage of white people, 71.9%, was high for the county; with black and Asian residents accounting for only 5.3% and 5% of the population, respectively. Principal ethnicities were Latino (14%), German (9.2%) and Irish (8.7%). Only 17.7% of its residents were foreign-born, a low figure compared to the city as a whole; of those, Mexico at 14.7% and the Philippines at 6.9% were the most common foreign places of birth. The median household income level of its residents was $73,111 in 2008, and 48.4% of its residents 25 and older had a four-year degree, both of which were high for the city. The average household size was 1.9 people, low for both the city and the county. Of its housing units 62.2% were occupied by renters and 37.8% by owners. Residents' median age was 37, which was old for the city of Los Angeles and old for the county. Only 9.7% of residents were headed by single parents, a low figure for both the city and the county. History=Early years The Tongva people have lived in the San Fernando Valley and the Los Angeles basin for 8,000 years. The Tongvan settlement Cahuenga used the springs and marsh in the Toluca Lake locale for water, fishing, hunting, harvesting, and building supplies (tule plants).SSPSHP ethnohistory from California State Parks After the Spanish conquest in the 1790s of Las Californias, the San Fernando Valley, including the \\"Toluca Lake locale\\", became the extended property of the Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa√±a. After the 1823 Independence of Mexico, the secularization of missions in Alta California included the issuing of a Mexican land grant for Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando.Ogden Hoffman, 1862, Reports of Land Cases Determined in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Numa Hubert, San Francisco The extreme eastern end of the lake was within the 1843 Rancho Providencia grant to Vincente de la Osa.Brief History of Vicente de la Ossa and Family In 1862, P√≠o Pico sold his share of the Ex-San Fernando Mission land, the entire southern half of the Valley below Roscoe Boulevard, to Isaac Lankershim (operating as the San Fernando Farm Homestead Association) in 1869. In 1873, Isaac Lankershim's son, James Boon Lankershim, and future son-in-law, Isaac Newton Van Nuys, took over management of the property, including the lake at Toluca. During the 1880s, the San Fernando Farm Homestead Association was succeeded by the Los Angeles Farm & Milling Company. Original Toluca Lake lot parcels in the Lankershim Ranch Land and Water Company land sales of 1887 In 1893, a petition was filed with the U.S. Postal Service for the area's first post office, to be named \\"Toluca Post Office\\". General Charles Forman, a wealthy local landowner and one of the proponents of the petition, later stated that he had chosen the name \\"Toluca\\" from a Paiute word meaning \\"fertile\\" or \\"beautiful\\" valley. Though part of a larger area traditionally called \\"Lankershim\\" after a colonel of the same name‚Äîand with a Southern Pacific Railroad train station named \\"Lankershim\\" that also opened in 1893 across from the post office‚ÄîForman called his own ranch and the surrounding land \\"Toluca\\". One of the wealthiest men in Nevada, Forman had made his fortune starting from nothing, first in mining, then cattle ranching, and then lumber. Falling in love with and marrying Los Angeles native Mary Agnes Gray, he soon moved to the area in the late 1880s and started the Kern River Company, a power company which delivered electricity from generators at the Kern River to Los Angeles. He also bought a large parcel of rich farm land, which included much of modern-day Toluca Lake and at least the western portion of the \\"ancient and historical\\" marshy pond now called Toluca Lake. By 1923, the Forman Toluca Lake Ranch was a flourishing producer of peaches, apples, and walnuts. Modern development In 1923, investors bought and developed the land as Toluca Lake Park. This initial venture failed, but a new group soon took over, renaming the firm as the Toluca Lake Company. With a \\"vision of creating a first 'bedroom community' for Los Angeles in the San Fernando Valley\\", the company formally changed the name of the community to simply Toluca Lake and adopted as their logo the \\"swan on rippled water\\" image associated with the community today. The name Lankershim also was considered for the town. Colonel J. B. Lankershim established the town site of Toluca at the eastern edge of the family's vast holdings in 1888. The town name was changed from Toluca to Lankershim in 1896. By 1927, the lure of Hollywood inspired local merchants to launch a campaign to change the community's name to North Hollywood. The original town site of Toluca is now part of Toluca Lake. Newlyweds Ronald and Nancy Reagan in Toluca Lake, 1952 The Lakeside golf course was designed in 1924 by Max Behr. This attracted actor Richard Arlen, who became one of Toluca Lake's first residents, and eventually its honorary mayor. Aviator Amelia Earhart lived in Toluca Lake on Valley Spring Lane after marrying publishing magnate George P. Putnam in 1931. The Spanish colonial- style home, which exists today, features a front-yard tree under which she signed her round-the-world flight plan. She made her home in Toluca Lake because the best aircraft were being designed and built at the Lockheed plant in Burbank. Entertainer Bob Hope moved to Toluca Lake in the late 1930s, and lived there until his death in 2003 at the age of 100. In the 1938 Little Rascals film Three Men in a Tub, the kids hold a regatta on the lake, which was largely surrounded by open country at that time. Actors Bette Davis, W. C. Fields, Dorothy Lamour, Billie Dove, Dick Powell, and Bing Crosby also moved into the community. In 1943, Crosby's mansion was almost completely destroyed by fire. Frank Sinatra also moved into Toluca Lake in the 1940s. Former actor and 40th President of the United States Ronald Reagan had his wedding reception with second wife Nancy Reagan at the Toluca Lake home of actor (and best man) William Holden on March 4, 1952. Notable residents have included Steve Carell, Miley Cyrus, Viola Davis, Kirsten Dunst, Melissa McCarthy, and Octavia Spencer. In June 2018, Ron Burkle purchased the 5.2 acre Bob Hope estate for $15 million, with the proceeds going to the Bob and Dolores Hope Foundation. Politics Toluca Lake is represented by City Councilman David Ryu in the Los Angeles City Council and Adrin Nazarian in the California State Assembly. NBC-4 weatherman Fritz Coleman is the honorary mayor of Toluca Lake. In 2006, Toluca Lake homeowner groups mobilized against a proposed development in North Hollywood by NBCUniversal and Thomas Properties Group. The Metro Studio Project involves upwards of of space and would house employees leaving NBC's Burbank facility. The project also proposes Times Square-style supergraphics and digital illuminated billboards. It would be built partly on land for which NBCUniversal has a lease agreement from the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has yet to act on the proposal, and Environmental Impact Reports are not finalized. Education The 2000 census found that 48.4% of Toluca Lake residents within Los Angeles had earned a four-year degree, a high figure for both the city and the county. The percentage of those residents with a master's degree or higher was large for the county. The Los Angeles section of Toluca Lake is a part of the Los Angeles Unified School District.

Wilson (DDG-7), named for Admiral Henry Braid Wilson, was a Charles F. Adams-class guided missile armed destroyer laid down by Defoe Shipbuilding Company in Bay City, Michigan on 28 February 1958, launched on 22 April 1959 sponsored by Mrs. Patrick J. Hurley, daughter of Admiral Wilson, and commissioned on 17 December 1960, CDR L. D. Caney in command.  History  One of a new class of destroyers built from the keel up to fire guided missiles, Henry B. Wilson was the first ship of her size to be side-launched and when launched was the largest warship ever constructed on the Great Lakes. Because of these unique circumstances, she was christened not with the traditional champagne but with a bottle filled with water from the Great Lakes, the Saint Lawrence River, and the Atlantic Ocean. Following shakedown in the Caribbean she arrived in early May 1961 at her new home port, San Diego. During the months that followed Henry B. Wilson conducted tests and drills of her missile systems, fleet exercises, and type training. The guided missile destroyer sailed 6 January 1962 for duty in the Western Pacific, the first ship in that region to be armed with Tartar missiles. Stopping at Pearl Harbor and Yokosuka, she carried out antisubmarine exercises until returning to the United States 19 July 1962. Training off the California coast, punctuated with several missile firings, occupied Henry B. Wilson until 17 October 1963, when she sailed with carrier Kitty Hawk for duty with 7th Fleet in the Western Pacific. During the next 5 months she operated as part of America's mobile peacekeeping fleet between Japan and the Philippines. After returning to San Diego 16 April 1964, she resumed ASW and fire support operations. Henry B. Wilson sailed on her third deployment to the Far East 4 June 1965. Arriving Subic Bay, Luzon, 21 June, she became flagship for Destroyer Squadron 21, then began rescue and air defense picket duty in the Gulf of Tonkin 31 July, along with shore bombardment support. As escort for , she departed Subic Bay 7 November and arrived San Diego the 24th. After a year's operation off the West Coast, Henry B. Wilson departed San Diego for the Far East 5 November 1966. She resume picket duty off Vietnam 23 December. During the first 3 months of 1967 she cruised the South China Sea and Gulf of Tonkin, performing search and rescue missions and pounding enemy coastal positions in support of ground operations. She returned to San Diego early in May. Henry B. Wilson served as plane guard for carriers on Yankee Station in the Tonkin Gulf, participated in Sea Dragon operations, patrolled on search and rescue duties and carried out naval gunfire support missions during the Vietnam War. In April 1975, she participated in Operation Eagle Pull (the evacuation of Phnom Penh, Cambodia) and in May 1975 she participated in Operation Frequent Wind (the evacuation of South Viet Nam) where part of her duties was to protect the ships loading evacuees by drawing fire from the shore batteries. During the same month she was one of the primaries in the operation to recapture the hijacked merchant ship in Cambodian waters. On 10 August 1976 Henry B. Wilson departed home port for a Western Pacific deployment, returning home 21 March 1977. On 8 August 1979 she departed for another Westpac cruise and returned home on 14 February 1980. On 27 February 1981 Henry B. Wilson departed for another Westpac, returning on 21 September 1981. On 16 Mar 1984 Henry B. Wilson departed for a Westpac deployment and returned home 2 October 1984. On 15 September 1986 she departed for a Westpac and Indian Ocean deployment, returning home 14 March 1987. On 2 December 1988 Henry B. Wilson departed on her final deployment going to the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean. She returned 1 June 1989.  Fate  Henry B. Wilson was decommissioned on 2 October 1989, stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 26 January 1990 and sold for scrap on 15 April 1994. The scrap contract was terminated on 23 March 1999 and the ship was resold on 6 April 2002. She was re-acquired and sunk as a target ship 15 August 2003.  Awards  According to the Navy Unit awards site, Henry B. Wilson received a number of awards in her history. * Combat Action Ribbon for 16 May 1968, 3 June 1968, 3 November 1972 and 9‚Äì10 November 1972 * Navy Unit Commendation for 16 July 1972 to 21 January 1973 * Meritorious Unit Commendation for 16 February 1967 to 3 March 1967 * Meritorious Unit Commendation for 27 February 1968 to 8 July 1968 * Meritorious Unit Commendation for 4 November 1969 to 3 April 1970 * Meritorious Unit Commendation 12 April 1975, Operation Eagle Pull * Meritorious Unit Commendation 20 April 1975 to 2 May 1975, Operation Frequent Wind * Navy E Ribbon for 1 July 1974 to 1 April 1976 and 1 January 1985 to 30 June 1986 * Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for 10 January 1970 to 13 January 1970. * Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for 23 July 1971 to 11 September 1971 * Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for 11 April 1975 to 13 April 1975, Operation Eagle Pull * Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for 29 April 1975 to 30 April 1975, Operation Frequent Wind * Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for 15 May 1975, Mayaquez Operation * Vietnam Service Medal for several periods in 1965 and 1967 to 1973. * Humanitarian Service Medal for 12 April 1975, Operation Eagle Pull * Humanitarian Service Medal, for 29 April 1975 to 30 April 1975, Operation Frequent Wind * Republic of Vietnam Meritorious Unit Citation (Gallantry Cross Medal Color with Palm) for several periods in 1968  References = Citations  Sources  * *  External links  * http://www.usshenrybwilsonddg7.com * MaritimeQuest USS Henry B.

That is, for :x = a_0+\\\\cfrac{1}{a_1+\\\\cfrac{1}{a_2+\\\\cfrac{1}{a_3+\\\\cfrac{1}{\\\\ddots}}}}\\\\; it is almost always true that :\\\\lim_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty } \\\\left( a_1 a_2 ... a_n \\\\right) ^{1/n} = K_0 where K_0 is Khinchin's constant :K_0 = \\\\prod_{r=1}^\\\\infty {\\\\left( 1+{1\\\\over r(r+2)}\\\\right)}^{\\\\log_2 r} \\\\approx 2.6854520010\\\\dots (with \\\\prod denoting the product over all sequence terms). Although almost all numbers satisfy this property, it has not been proven for any real number not specifically constructed for the purpose. Among the numbers x whose continued fraction expansions are known not to have this property are rational numbers, roots of quadratic equations (including the golden ratio Œ¶ and the square roots of integers), and the base of the natural logarithm e. Khinchin is sometimes spelled Khintchine (the French transliteration of Russian –•–∏–Ω—á–∏–Ω) in older mathematical literature. Sketch of proof The proof presented here was arranged by Czes≈Çaw Ryll-Nardzewski and is much simpler than Khinchin's original proof which did not use ergodic theory. Since the first coefficient a0 of the continued fraction of x plays no role in Khinchin's theorem and since the rational numbers have Lebesgue measure zero, we are reduced to the study of irrational numbers in the unit interval, i.e., those in I=[0,1]\\\\setminus\\\\mathbb{Q}. These numbers are in bijection with infinite continued fractions of the form [0; a1, a2, ...], which we simply write [a1, a2, ...], where a1, a2, ... are positive integers. Define a transformation T:I -> I by :T([a_1,a_2,\\\\dots])=[a_2,a_3,\\\\dots].\\\\, The transformation T is called the Gauss‚ÄìKuzmin‚ÄìWirsing operator. For every Borel subset E of I, we also define the Gauss-Kuzmin measure of E :\\\\mu(E)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\log 2}\\\\int_E\\\\frac{dx}{1+x}. Then Œº is a probability measure on the œÉ-algebra of Borel subsets of I. The measure Œº is equivalent to the Lebesgue measure on I, but it has the additional property that the transformation T preserves the measure Œº. Moreover, it can be proved that T is an ergodic transformation of the measurable space I endowed with the probability measure Œº (this is the hard part of the proof). The ergodic theorem then says that for any Œº-integrable function f on I, the average value of f \\\\left( T^k x \\\\right) is the same for almost all x: :\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac 1n\\\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}(f\\\\circ T^k)(x)=\\\\int_I f d\\\\mu\\\\quad\\\\text{for }\\\\mu\\\\text{-almost all }x\\\\in I. Applying this to the function defined by f([a1, a2, ...]) = log(a1), we obtain that :\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac 1n\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\\\log(a_k)=\\\\int_I f \\\\, d\\\\mu = \\\\sum_{r=1}^\\\\infty\\\\log(r)\\\\frac{\\\\log\\\\bigl(1+\\\\frac{1}{r(r+2)}\\\\bigr)}{\\\\log 2} for almost all [a1, a2, ...] in I as n -> ‚àû. Taking the exponential on both sides, we obtain to the left the geometric mean of the first n coefficients of the continued fraction, and to the right Khinchin's constant. Series expressions Khinchin's constant may be expressed as a rational zeta series in the formBailey, Borwein & Crandall, 1997. In that paper, a slightly non- standard definition is used for the Hurwitz zeta function. :\\\\log K_0 = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\log 2} \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac {\\\\zeta (2n)-1}{n} \\\\sum_{k=1}^{2n-1} \\\\frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k} or, by peeling off terms in the series, :\\\\log K_0 = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\log 2} \\\\left[ -\\\\sum_{k=2}^N \\\\log \\\\left(\\\\frac{k-1}{k} \\\\right) \\\\log \\\\left(\\\\frac{k+1}{k} \\\\right) \\\\+ \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac {\\\\zeta (2n,N+1)}{n} \\\\sum_{k=1}^{2n-1} \\\\frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k} \\\\right] where N is an integer, held fixed, and Œ∂(s, n) is the complex Hurwitz zeta function. Both series are strongly convergent, as Œ∂(n) ‚àí 1 approaches zero quickly for large n. An expansion may also be given in terms of the dilogarithm: :\\\\log K_0 = \\\\log 2 + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\log 2} \\\\left[ \\\\mbox{Li}_2 \\\\left( \\\\frac{-1}{2} \\\\right) + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum_{k=2}^\\\\infty (-1)^k \\\\mbox{Li}_2 \\\\left( \\\\frac{4}{k^2} \\\\right) \\\\right]. H√∂lder means The Khinchin constant can be viewed as the first in a series of the H√∂lder means of the terms of continued fractions. Given an arbitrary series {an}, the H√∂lder mean of order p of the series is given by :K_p=\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{k=1}^n a_k^p \\\\right]^{1/p}. When the {an} are the terms of a continued fraction expansion, the constants are given by :K_p=\\\\left[\\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty -k^p \\\\log_2\\\\left( 1-\\\\frac{1}{(k+1)^2} \\\\right) \\\\right]^{1/p}. This is obtained by taking the p-th mean in conjunction with the Gauss‚ÄìKuzmin distribution. The value for K0 may be shown to be obtained in the limit of p -> 0\\\\. Harmonic mean By means of the above expressions, the harmonic mean of the terms of a continued fraction may be obtained as well. The value obtained is :K_{-1}=1.74540566240\\\\dots .

Article 1 of the French Constitution is commonly interpreted as discouraging religious involvement in government affairs, especially religious influence in the determination of state policies; it also forbids government involvement in religious affairs, and especially prohibits government influence in the determination of religion. Secularism in France does not preclude a right to the free exercise of religion.Religion and Society in Modern Europe, by Ren√© R√©mond (Author), Antonia Nevill (Translator), Malden, MA, U.S.A.: Blackwell Publishers, 1999.Evelyn M. Acomb, The French Laic Laws, 1879-1889: The First Anti-Clerical Campaign of the Third French Republic, New York : Columbia University Press, 1941 French secularism has a long history. For the last century, the French government policy has been based on the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, See drop-down essay on \\"The Third Republic and the 1905 Law of La√Øcit√©\\", which is however not applicable in Alsace and Moselle. History Secularism is a concept rooted in the French Revolution, as it started to develop since the French Third Republic, after the Republicans gained control of the state. The word la√Øcit√© has been used, from the end of the 19th century to mean the freedom of public institutions, especially primary schools, from the influence of the Catholic ChurchExcerpt of Nouveau dictionnaire de p√©dagogie et d'instruction primaire, 1911: in countries where it had retained its influence, in the context of a secularization process. Today, the concept covers other religious movements as well. Proponents assert the French state secularism is based on respect for freedom of thought and freedom of religion. Thus the absence of a state religion, and the subsequent separation of the state and Church, is considered by proponents to be a prerequisite for such freedom of thought. Proponents maintain that la√Øcit√© is thus distinct from anti-clericalism, which actively opposes the influence of religion and the clergy. La√Øcit√© relies on the division between private life, where adherents believe religion belongs, and the public sphere, in which each individual, adherents believe, should appear as a simple citizen equal to all other citizens, devoid of ethnic, religious or other particularities. According to this concept, the government must refrain from taking positions on religious doctrine and consider religious subjects only for their practical consequences on inhabitants' lives. Supporters argue that la√Øcit√© by itself does not necessarily imply any hostility of the government with respect to any religion. It is best described as a belief that government and political issues should be kept separate from religious organizations and religious issues (as long as the latter do not have notable social consequences). This is meant to both protect the government from any possible interference from religious organizations, and to protect the religious organization from political quarrels and controversies. Critics of la√Øcit√© argue that it is a disguised form of anti-clericalism and infringement on individual right to religious expression, and that, instead of promoting freedom of thought and freedom of religion, it prevents the believer from observing his or her religion. Another critique is that, in countries historically dominated by one religious tradition, officially avoiding taking any positions on religious matters favors the dominant religious tradition of the relevant country. Even in the current French Fifth Republic (1958‚Äì), school holidays mostly follow the Christian liturgical year, that include Christmas and holiday seasons, though Easter holidays have been replaced by Spring holidays which may or may not include Easter, depending on the vagaries of the liturgical calendar. However, schools have long given leave to students for important holidays of their specific non-majority religions, and food menus served in secondary schools pay particular attention to ensuring that each religious observer may respect his religion's specific restrictions concerning diets. Current status The principle of la√Øcit√© in France is implemented through a number of policies. The French government is legally prohibited from recognizing any religion (except for legacy statutes like those of military chaplains and the local law of Alsace-Moselle). Instead, it recognizes religious organizations, according to formal legal criteria that do not address religious doctrine: * whether the sole purpose of the organization is to organize religious activities (so that, for instance, the pretense of being a religious organization is not used for tax evasion) * whether the organization disrupts public order. French political leaders, though not by any means prohibited from making religious remarks, mostly refrain from it. Religious considerations are generally considered incompatible with reasoned political debate. Political leaders are not allowed to practice any religion, and are expected to differentiate whatever religious beliefs from their political arguments. Christine Boutin, who openly argued on religious grounds against a legal domestic partnership available regardless of the sex of the partners, quickly became the butt of late-night comedy jokes. The term was originally the French equivalent of the term laity, that is, everyone who is not clergy. After the French Revolution this meaning changed and it came to mean keeping religion separate from the executive, judicial, and legislative branches of government. This includes prohibitions on having a state religion, as well as for the government to endorse any religious position, be it a religion or atheism. Although the term was current throughout the 19th century, France did not fully separate church and state until the passage of its 1905 law on the separation of the Churches and the State, prohibiting the state from recognizing or funding any religion. The notion of la√Øcit√© as a legal principle is open to question, because it is never defined as such by the text of a law. The 1905 law establishing separation did not use the word la√Øcit√©. It was not until the Constitution of 1946 (Constitution de 1946, IVe R√©publique) that the word appeared explicitly as a constitutional principle entailing legal effect, but without being further specified. All religious buildings in France (mostly Catholic churches, Protestant chapels, and Jewish synagogues) became the property of the city councils. Those now have the duty to maintain the (often historical) buildings but cannot subsidize the religious organizations using them. In areas that were part of Germany at that time, and which did not return to France until 1918, some arrangements for the cooperation of church and state are still in effect today (see Alsace- Moselle). Secularism is a core concept in the French constitution, Article 1 of which formally states that France is a secular republic (\\"La France est une R√©publique indivisible, la√Øque, d√©mocratique et sociale.\\") This, however, does not prevent an active role on the part of the state (President of the Republic, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of the Interior) in the appointment of Catholic diocesan bishops ‚Äì see Briand-Ceretti Agreement: the President of the French Republic is the only head of state in the world (except the Pope) who still appoints Catholic bishops (in Strasbourg and Metz); moreover, he is an honorary Canon in several cathedrals and basilicas, most notably in the Archbasilica of Saint John in Laterano, the Cathedral of the Pope. Many see being discreet with one's religion as a necessary part of being French. This has led to frequent divisions with some non-Christian immigrants, especially with part of France's large Muslim population. A debate took place over whether any religious apparel or displays by individuals, such as the Islamic hijab, Sikh turban, (large) Christian crosses, and Jewish Stars of David and kippah, should be banned from public schools. Such a ban came into effect in France in 2004; see French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools. In the spring of 2011 there was a reinforcement of la√Øcit√© in hospitals, advocated by the Minister of the Interior, Claude Gu√©ant, and in public service generally, by the official non-discrimination agency, la HALDE. The simultaneous broadcasting of the traditional Protestant and Catholic Lent sermons (operating since 1946) has been interrupted. Earlier the broadcasting of the Russian Orthodox Christmas night liturgy was similarly stopped on 6/7 January. The strict separation of church and state which began with the 1905 law has evolved into what some religious leaders see as a \\"form of political correctness that made bringing religion into public affairs a major taboo\\".Beita, Peter B. French President's religious mixing riles critics Christianity Today, Jan. 23, 2008 Former President Sarkozy initially criticised this approach as a \\"negative la√Øcit√©\\" and wanted to develop a \\"positive la√Øcit√©\\" that recognizes the contribution of faith to French culture, history and society, allows for faith in the public discourse and for government subsidies for faith-based groups. Sarkozy saw France's main religions as positive contributions to French society. He visited the pope in December 2007 and publicly acknowledged France's Christian roots, while highlighting the importance of freedom of thought, arguing that faith should come back into the public sphere. In line with Sarkozy's views on the need for reform of la√Øcit√©, Pope Benedict XVI on September 12, 2008 said it was time to revisit the debate over the relationship between church and state, advocating a \\"healthy\\" form of la√Øcit√©. Meeting with Sarkozy, he stated: \\"In fact, it is fundamental, on the one hand, to insist upon the distinction between the political realm and that of religion in order to preserve both the religious freedom of citizens and the responsibility of the state toward them.\\" He went on: \\"On the other hand, [it is important] to become more aware of the irreplaceable role of religion for the formation of consciences and the contribution which it can bring to ‚Äì among other things ‚Äì the creation of a basic ethical consensus within society.\\" Sarkozy later changed footing on the place of religion in French society, by publicly declaring the burqa \\"not welcome\\" in France in 2009 and favoring legislation to outlaw it, following which in February 2010 a post office robbery took place by two burqa-clad robbers, ethnicity unknown, who after entering the post office removed their veils. Following March 2011 local elections strong disagreement appeared within the governing UMP over the appropriateness of holding a debate on la√Øcit√© as desired by the President of the Republic. On 30 March a letter appeared in La Croix signed by representatives of six religious bodies opposing the appropriateness of such a debate. A law was passed on April 11, 2011 with strong support from political parties as well as from Sarkozy which made it illegal to hide the face in public spaces, affecting a few thousand women in France wearing the niqab and the burqa. Scholar Olivier Roy has argued that the burkini bans and secularist policies of France provoked religious violence in France, to which Gilles Kepel responded that Britain which has no such policies still suffered a greater number of attacks in 2017 than France.  Influence on other countries  Other countries followed in the French model, having forms of secularism ‚Äì examples include Albania, Mexico and Turkey.  Quebec (Canada)  Public discourse in Quebec, the only predominantly French-speaking province in Canada, has been greatly influenced by the secularism of France since the 1960s. Prior to this time, Quebec was seen as a very observant Catholic society, where Catholicism was a de facto state religion. Quebec then underwent a period of rapid secularization called the Quiet Revolution. Quebec politicians have tended to adopt a more French-style understanding of secularism rather than the rest of Canada which is similar to the United States. This came to the fore during the debate on what constitutes the \\"reasonable accommodation\\" of religious minorities. In September 2013, the government of Quebec proposed Bill 60, the \\"Charter affirming the values of State secularism and religious neutrality and of equality between women and men, and providing a framework for accommodation requests.\\" The bill would alter the provincial human rights law to prohibit public employees from wearing objects that overtly indicate a religious preference. The people who would be most impacted by such a law would be Muslim women wearing a hijab, Jewish men wearing a kippah, and Sikh men (or women) wearing a turban. Employees who do not comply with the law would be terminated from their employment. The party that had proposed the bill, the Parti Qu√©b√©cois, was defeated in the 2014 election by the Quebec Liberal Party (who gained a majority of seats), which opposed the bill. As a result, the bill is considered 'dead'. In 2019, Premier Fran√ßois Legault's CAQ government passed Bill 21, a secularism law banning public officials in positions of coercive power from wearing or displaying any religious symbols. However, the display of religious symbols affixed in public institutions like hospitals will be left for each administration thereof to decide. To counter charges of hypocrisy, the crucifix in the Quebec National Assembly was also removed.  Mexico  French la√Øcit√© influenced the Constitution of Mexico despite the Catholic Church maintain strong influence. In March 2010, the Chamber Deputies introduced legislation to amend the Constitution to make the Mexican government formally \\"laico\\" ‚Äì meaning \\"lay\\" or \\"secular\\".Goodrich, Luke, Mexico's Separation of Church and State OffNews March 18, 2010, originally published in the Wall Street Journal Critics of the move say the \\"context surrounding the amendment suggests that it might be a step backwards for religious liberty and true separation of church and state\\". Coming on the heels of the Church's vocal objection to legalization of abortion as well as same sex unions and adoptions in Mexico City, \\"together with some statements of its supporters, suggests that it might be an attempt to suppress the Catholic Church's ability to engage in public policy debates\\". Mexico has had a history of religious suppression and persecution. Critics of the amendment reject the idea that \\"Utilitarians, Nihilists, Capitalists, and Socialists can all bring their philosophy to bear on public life, but Catholics (or religious minorities) must check their religion at the door\\" in a sort of \\"second-class citizenship\\" which they consider nothing more than religious discrimination.  Switzerland  Turkey  In Turkey, a strong stance of secularism (\\"Laiklik\\" in Turkish) has held sway since Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk's Turkish revolution in the early 20th century. On March 3, 1924, Turkey removed the caliphate system and gradually after that, all religious influence from the state. Sunni Islam, the majority religion, is now controlled by the Turkish government through the Department of Religious Affairs, and is state-funded while other religions or sects have independence on religious affairs. Islamic views which are deemed political are censored in accordance with the principle of secularism. This system of Turkish la√Øcit√© permeates both the government and religious sphere. The content of the weekly sermons in all state funded mosques has to be approved by the state. Also, independent Sunni communities are illegal. Minority religions, like Armenian or Greek Orthodoxy, are guaranteed by the constitution as individual faiths and are mostly tolerated, but this guarantee does not give any rights to any religious communities including Muslim ones. Turkey's view is that the Treaty of Lausanne gives certain religious rights to Jews, Greeks, and Armenians but not, for example, to Syrian-Orthodox or Roman Catholics, because the latter ones did not play any political roles during the treaty. However the Treaty of Lausanne does not specify any nationality or ethnicity and simply identifies non-Muslims in general. Recently, the desire to reestablish the Greek Orthodox seminary on Heybeli Island near Istanbul became a political issue in regard to Turkey's accession to EU membership. The EU considers such prohibition to amount to suppression of religious freedom. However, it is pointed out that if Greek Orthodoxy is allowed to reopen a school it will become the only religion in Turkey with the right to an independent religious school. Recent attempts by the conservative government to outlaw adultery caused an outcry in Turkey and was seen as an attempt to legislate Islamic values, but others point out that the legislation was intended to combat polygamy which is still common in rural areas, although not recognized legally.  Contrast with the United States  In the United States, the First Amendment to the Constitution contains a similar federal concept, although the term \\"laicity\\" is not used either in the Constitution or elsewhere, and is in fact used as a term to contrast European secularism with American secularism. That amendment includes clauses prohibiting both congressional governmental interference with the \\"free exercise\\" of religion, and congressional laws regarding the establishment of religion. Originally this prevented the federal government from interfering with state-established religions. But after the 14th amendment, these clauses have been held by the courts to apply to both the federal and state governments. Together, the \\"free exercise clause\\" and \\"establishment clause\\" are considered to accomplish a \\"separation of church and state.\\" However, separation is not extended to bar religious conduct in public places or by public servants. Public servants, up to and including the President of the United States, often make proclamations of religious faith. Sessions of both houses of the United States Congress and most state legislatures typically open with a prayer by a minister of some faith or other, and many if not most politicians and senior public servants in Washington, DC attend the annual Roman Catholic Red Mass at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle regardless of their personal religious convictions. In contrast to France, the wearing of religious insignia in public schools is largely noncontroversial as a matter of law and culture in the U.S.; the main cases where there have been controversies are when the practice in question is potentially dangerous (for instance, the wearing of the Sikh kirpan knife in public places), and even then the issue is usually settled in favor of allowing the practice. In addition, the U.S. government regards religious institutions as tax-exempt non-profits, subject to limitations on their political involvement. Moreover, the military includes government-paid religious chaplains to provide for the spiritual needs of soldiers. In contrast to Europe, however, the government cannot display religious symbols (such as the cross) in public schools, courts and other government offices, although some exceptions are made (e.g. recognition of a cultural group's religious holiday). In addition, the United States Supreme Court has banned any activity in public schools and other government-run areas that can be viewed as a government endorsement of religion. The French philosopher and Universal Declaration of Human Rights co- drafter Jacques Maritain, a devout Catholic convert and a critic of French la√Øcit√©, noted the distinction between the models found in France and in the mid-twentieth century United States. He considered the US model of that time to be more amicable because it had both \\"sharp distinction and actual cooperation\\" between church and state, what he called \\"a historical treasure\\" and admonished the United States, \\"Please to God that you keep it carefully, and do not let your concept of separation veer round to the European one.\\" See also    * * NotesReferencesExternal links * One of the architects of the law against religious symbols in schools defends the liberalism of laicite in the Harvard Law Record * The deep roots of French secularism, article by Henri Astier on BBC News online, Sept 1st, 2004 * Karakas, Cemal (2007): Turkey.

History Fuller Theological Seminary was founded in 1947 by Charles E. Fuller, a radio evangelist known for his Old Fashioned Revival Hour show, and Harold Ockenga, the pastor of Park Street Church in Boston. Randall Herbert Balmer, Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism: Revised and expanded edition, Baylor University Press, USA, 2004, p. 276 The seminary's founders sought to reform fundamentalism's separatist and sometimes anti-intellectual stance during the 1920s‚Äì1940s. Fuller envisaged that the seminary would become \\"a Caltech of the evangelical world.\\" The earliest faculty held theologically and socially conservative views, though professors with differing perspectives arrived in the 1960s and 1970s. There were tensions in the late 1950s and early 1960s as some faculty members became uncomfortable with staff and students who did not agree with Biblical inerrancy. This led to the people associated with the seminary playing a role in the rise of neo-evangelicalism. In 2019, it had 2,672 students enrolled. Presidents Fuller has had five presidents over its 70+ year history. The founding president, Harold Ockenga, remained in Boston and served as president in absentia from 1947 to 1954. He described his role to Charles Fuller as recruiting faculty and setting the curriculum, which did not require his active presence in Pasadena. His successor and protege Edward John Carnell, a Baptist theologian and apologist, took over the post in 1954 but resigned in 1959 under failing health. Ockenga resumed his in absentia leadership until 35-year-old David Allen Hubbard, a Baptist Old Testament scholar and member of Fuller's third entering class, became Fuller's third president in 1963. Hubbard served for 30 years and led the seminary through both substantial growth and significant controversy. Hubbard was succeeded by Reformed philosopher and theologian Richard Mouw, who served as president of Fuller from 1993 to 2013. In 2006, a Los Angeles Times article labeled him as \\"one of the nation's leading evangelicals\\". In July 2013, Mark Labberton became the Clifford L. Penner Presidential Chair of Fuller. Labberton, a Presbyterian (USA) pastor, had previously served Fuller as director of the Lloyd John Ogilvie Institute of Preaching since 2009. He retains his position as Lloyd John Ogilvie Associate Professor of Preaching alongside the presidency. Mouw remains at Fuller as Professor of Faith and Public Life. Theology and academics Fuller is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada and the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. Fuller's student body of 2,897 includes students from 90 countries and 110 denominational backgrounds. Fuller instructors have proposed an alternative perspective on the conservative/liberal debate: Faculty member Tom Sine was quoted in the Seattle Times in 2004 as saying, \\"We need to be the voice of a third way that flows out of biblical values, instead of buying into the political ideology of either the right or the left.\\" Schools and degrees Fuller Theological Seminary is organized into schools of theology, psychology, and intercultural studies. The seminary emphasizes integration of the three schools and many students take courses in more than one school. The seminary offers 18 degree programs, including seven master's degrees and 11 advanced degrees. Campuses Fuller is closing Fuller Northwest (Seattle), Fuller Bay Area (Menlo Park), Fuller Orange County (Irvine). It is also reducing degree programs offered in Fuller Colorado (Colorado Springs) and Fuller Arizona (Phoenix). These closures and reductions will take place before the 2019‚Äì20 academic year. In May 2009, Fuller opened its David Allan Hubbard Library that incorporated the former McAlister Library building at its main campus in Pasadena, California for a total of . On May 23, 2018, Fuller announced that its main campus in Pasadena would be sold and the seminary would move its main campus to Pomona by 2021. In October 2019 the board of directors voted to cancel the move and remain in Pasadena, citing dramatically escalated costs of construction in Southern California and differences with the City of Pasadena, which affected the sale and sale price of the seminary‚Äôs Pasadena campus.  Social issues  While Fuller has established policies, the seminary is open to difference in opinion among students and faculty. The seminary's current president, Mark Labberton, marched in favor of comprehensive immigration reform and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants in 2013. Others have expressed support in the Fuller forum for the Black Lives Matter movement as raising awareness for civil rights. In 2015, some faculty at the seminary called on Christians to openly discuss, with respect, issues related to race, gender, sexual orientation, refugees, and immigrants. While the seminary officially recognizes marriage as \\"between a man and a woman\\", the seminary did allow an LGBTQ student club to organize on campus; the club, \\"OneTable\\", became the first LGBTQ group organized within an evangelical seminary.  Awards and prizes  Fuller annually awards the David Allan Hubbard Achievement Award to a graduating student from each of Seminary‚Äôs three schools, in recognition of outstanding work completed while at Fuller. The award was instituted in honor of David Allan Hubbard, an Old Testament scholar, and the third President of Fuller Theological Seminary. Each recipient is chosen by the faculty of their respective school.

Flood in the Barcoo River, Blackall district, February 1941 The Barcoo River in western Queensland, Australia rises on the northern slopes of the Warrego Range, flows in a south-westerly direction and unites with the Thomson River to form Cooper Creek. The first European to see the river was Thomas Mitchell in 1846, who named it Victoria River, believing it to be the same river as that named Victoria River by J. C. Wickham in 1839. It was renamed by Edmund Kennedy after a name supplied by local Aborigines. The waters of the river flow towards Lake Eyre in central Australia while those of rivers further east join the Murray-Darling basin and reach the sea in South Australia. The river forms a boundary between outback Australia and the \\"Far Outback\\"; legend has it that west of the Barcoo there is very little in the way of civilisation. Tributaries include the Alice River Towns situated on the banks of the Barcoo River include Blackall, Isisford, Tambo and Retreat. The southern boundary of Welford National Park is marked by the Barcoo River and Isisford Weir has been constructed on the Barcoo. Barcoo grunter The Barcoo grunter, also known as jade perch (scortum barcoo), is a native Australian freshwater fish found in the eastern Northern Territory rivers of Limmen, Roper, Macarthur; the Barkley Basin, and between the Gilbert River in Northern Queensland and the Lake Eyre drainage of central Australia. Barcoo Grunter is an excellent food fish, and is often farmed in intensive grow-out ponds or tanks in aquaculture. Disease The river, or at least the district, also gives its name to several diseases, once widespread in outback Australia but now largely unknown. One is \\"Barcoo rot\\", a skin disease, perhaps similar to \\"desert sore\\", characterised by crusted impetiginous skin sores and occurring in association with heat, dirt, minor traumas and a diet chronically deficient in fresh fruit and vegetables. A second is \\"Barcoo fever\\" in which the sufferer experiences fever, nausea and vomiting which was exacerbated by the sight or smell of food, and constipation. This disease, once common in the outback, has also vanished. It may have been due to drinking water contaminated by cyanobacterial (blue-green algal) toxins. Provision of more reliable food supplies and safer sources of water in the \\"far Barcoo\\" may explain why these diseases have now all but disappeared. The name also appears in the phrase \\"the Barcoo salute\\" ‚Äì brushing the ever-present bush flies from the face with either hand. Literary references The Barcoo is mentioned in some poems of Banjo Paterson. Examples are in the second stanza of Saltbush Bill and the first stanza of A Bush Christening. The Barcoo is also referenced in Slim Dusty‚Äôs song, ‚ÄúMad Jack‚Äôs Cockatoo‚Äù, in the second line of the first verse.

History Carl Laemmle officially opened the Second Universal City (Lankershim Boulevard) on March 15, 1915, on the Taylor Ranch property. At the launch event, in what is now the North Hollywood area, a crowd of men and women eagerly awaited the display of the film stages, daredevil stunt pilots and silent film idols, as well as the movie cameras Laemmle had brought along. \\"See how slapstick comedies are made. See your favorite screen stars do their work. See how we make the people laugh or cry or sit on the edge of their chairs the world over!\\" stated a poster touting Universal's opening. \\"C'mon out! Aw, c'mon!\\" Laemmle, a German immigrant, was Universal Pictures' founder who opened his first nickelodeon in Chicago in 1906. He moved to New York City, where he soon joined half a dozen small motion picture companies to create the movie company he called Universal Pictures. In 1912, Laemmle briefly operated three small studios - Bison, Nestor, and Oak Crest Ranch. After a court battle with New York Motion Picture Company, control of the Bison lot was returned to the New York Motion Picture Company. The court allowed Carl Laemmle to retain use of the name \\"Bison\\" as \\"Bison 101\\" for his westerns, \\"Film History Before 1920 - Greatest Films\\", Filmsite.org, FS4. which were filmed on the Oak Crest property in the San Fernando Valley. The Oak Crest Ranch is where Laemmle filmed the western At Old Fort Dearborn. The Providencia Land and Water company, called \\"Oak Crest Ranch\\" in the trade papers, became the first Universal City location. In 1913, Laemmle consolidated the Nestor studio (Hollywood) and Oak Crest ranch (Providencia) property. His first Universal City was too small, so he ordered a search for a new and larger property in the valley, a location with more space. Laemmle leased Providencia ranchland in the San Fernando Valley in 1912. If it was a city, it was a haphazard one (Motion Picture World): with the help of nearly 300 movie hands and actors, Laemmle erected makeshift buildings, set up cameras and began churning out hundreds of one- and two-reel silent westerns. Other studio chiefs called the place \\"Laemmle's Folly\\", mocking that the property was so far out of town and that Laemmle could film scenery for free anywhere he wanted. Laemmle worried that he had made a huge mistake, though Universal was a success because the public could observe movies being made. In the meantime, Laemmle added a zoo to the Oak Crest Ranch (Moving Picture World ad 1913) - which was open to visitors to generate free advertising by word of mouth. The Rotarians of Los Angeles were one of the groups permitted to visit the Oak Crest - Universal City. (The Rotarian - Feb 1914) The Oak Crest ranch being too small (Scrap-it) for his larger Universal City, Laemmle bought the Lankershim Land and Water property, the Taylor Ranch for $165,000, calling it his \\"New Universal City\\". In 1914, operations at The Oak Ranch (Providencia Ranch) were moved to the Taylor (Lankershim) ranch. The Universal (Oak Crest) ranch zoo was moved to the Back Ranch of the Lankershim property. [Moving Picture World] The new Universal City was opened for Universal staff in 1914. Laemmle went on an eight-day whistle-stop tour from Chicago to Los Angeles the week before Universal City's grand public opening. His promoters even sold the grand (and technically impossible) lie that Laemmle had persuaded the Secretary of the Navy to send a battleship up the Los Angeles River to fire a salvo on opening day. Easterners, they hoped, would believe anything they heard about California. After World War I, Laemmle brought even more kin over from war-torn Europe, increasing the payroll to 70. His cheerful nepotism was immortalized in humorist Ogden Nash's couplet: Uncle Carl Laemmle has a very large faemmle. Carl Laemmle was responsible for creating the \\"star system\\" rather than just using anonymous actors in films. Laemmle was forced to end studio tours in the 1920s, when talkies came along and \\"quiet on the set\\" became an absolute. He sold his sprawling entertainment empire in 1936. Before his death in 1939, at age 72, he helped bring more than 200 German-Jewish refugees to Los Angeles. A nephew, Max, founded the local Laemmle Theatres chain. Universal City did not welcome tourists again until July 15, 1964, with the opening of the Universal Studios Hollywood theme park and its included Studio Tour. The next few decades saw the arrival of hotels, an amphitheater, and Universal CityWalk (a faux city street and popular destination for tourists and locals). Universal Ranch 1912 On April 30, 1912, Carl Laemmle merged the Independent Motion Picture Company with five smaller companies to form the Universal Film Manufacturing Company. After visiting his newly acquired west coast operations of Nestor Studios and Nestor Ranch, he renamed the studio \\"Universal Studios\\" and the leased Oak Crest Ranch became the first \\"Universal City\\" in the San Fernando Valley. The first Universal/Nestor Ranch (Providencia Land and Water Development Company property Oak Crest Ranch) is presently the site of Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills). In 1915, Universal moved its operations at the Hollywood/Nestor studio and Universal/Nestor Ranch to its new Lankershim Blvd. location before the official opening of Universal City (Lankershim Blvd). In 1916, the first Universal Oak Ranch became known as the Lasky Ranch. The Hollywood studio was then leased to Christie Comedies. Universal City ‚Äì Oak Crest Ranch (1912‚Äì1914) In 1912, Carl Laemmle toured his Pacific coast operations. He renamed the Nestor Studio \\"Universal Studios\\" and renamed the provindencia Ranch \\"Universal City.\\" Carl Laemmle thought the Providencia ranch area was too small for his idea of \\"Universal City.\\" He ordered the purchase of Lankershim land Water Company property. Universal City moved to a new location, the Taylor Ranch Motion Picture World August 29, 1914 - page 1250 Lankershim Land and Water Company They purchased lots 276, 277, 278; also a small portion of Lot 279, marked \\"Mary L. Carhart\\" (left side of the Lankershim bridge). Only 230 acres (0.9 km2) of the northern part of lot 278 became the official studios front lot in 1915. The zoo and second open air stage were constructed on the northern sections of lot 277 and 278. The mountain portions above were not incorporated into studio use until MCA/Universal's master plan to level the hills and create the Universal Studio Tour Center and City Walk.

It uses a scale of 2 mm on the model to 1-foot on the prototype, which scales out to 1:152. The track gauge used to represent prototype standard gauge (4'8¬Ω\\") is . Track and wheels are closer to dead scale replicas than commercial British N. The 2mm standards were proposed by Mr. H H Groves in the early 1960s and revised to their current specification in November 1963 by Geoffrey Jones. It is similar in size to the slightly larger British N scale at 1:148 and the slightly smaller European/American N scale at 1:160; though it predates both. Since 2mm scale is very close to the 1:148 British N scale, a hybrid specification can be modelled by rewheeling proprietary British N scale models to the 9.42 mm track gauge. This hybrid specification results in a track gauge equivalent to 4 feet 6‚Öû inches (1394mm), slightly narrower than the prototype 4 feet 8¬Ω inches. There is an advantage however in the narrower gauge as this allows more room for the outside motion of outside cylindered steam locomotives which must be overscale in order to function correctly. This approach is often recommended for beginners. However, 2mm-scale and hybrid-scale models do not usually sit well together due to the larger size of the latter.  Support  No ready-to- run models are available in 2mm scale, and although there is some availability of kits and components, some model-making skill is normally required. There is an active association, The 2mm Scale Association, for modellers in this scale, who supply components, tools and jigs, publish a bi-monthly magazine, organise local groups, and promote modelling in the scale.

It traces its roots to the Medical Department of the University of the Pacific, founded in San Francisco in 1858. This medical institution, then called Cooper Medical College, was acquired by Stanford in 1908. The medical school moved to the Stanford campus near Palo Alto, California, in 1959. The School of Medicine, along with Stanford Health Care and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, is part of Stanford Medicine. Stanford Health Care was ranked the fourth best hospital in California. History In 1855, Illinois physician Elias Samuel Cooper moved to San Francisco in the wake of the California Gold Rush. In cooperation with the University of the Pacific (also known as California Wesleyan College), Cooper established the Medical Department of the University of the Pacific, the first medical school on the West Coast, in 1858, on Mission Street near 3rd Street in San Francisco. However, in 1862 Cooper died, and without his leadership, the Medical Department of the University of the Pacific became moribund. In 1870, Cooper's nephew, Levi Cooper Lane, reactivated and reorganized the University of the Pacific's medical department, and, in 1882, Lane donated a new building at the intersection of Webster and Sacramento Streets and established the department as a separate school, the Cooper Medical College. Lane built a hospital and a nursing school and made provision for the creation of Lane Medical Library. In 1908, Cooper Medical College was deeded to Stanford University as a gift. It became Stanford's medical institution, initially called the Stanford Medical Department and later the Stanford University School of Medicine. In the 1950s, the Stanford Board of Trustees decided to move the school to the Stanford main campus near Palo Alto. The move was completed in 1959. The San Francisco medical campus became Presbyterian Hospital and later California Pacific Medical Center. In the 1980s, the Medical Center launched a major expansion program. A new hospital was added in 1989 with 20 new operating rooms, state of the art intensive care and inpatient units, and other technological additions. The Beckman Center for Molecular and Genetic Medicine opened in May 1989 as an interdisciplinary center focusing on the molecular and genetic basis of disease. The Lucile Packard Children's Hospital was completed in 1991, adding even more diversity to Stanford Medicine. Li Ka Shing Center for Learning and Knowledge. In the early years of the 21st century, the School of Medicine underwent rapid construction to further expand teaching and clinical opportunities. The Li Ka Shing Center for Learning and Knowledge opened in 2010; it serves as the gateway to the School of Medicine as well as providing a new model of medical education by combining biomedical research with clinical education and information technology. The Lorry I. Lokey Stem Cell Research Building also opened in 2010; it is the largest stem cell and regenerative medicine facility in North America. The Stem Cell Research Building is the first of the planned Stanford Institutes of Medicine. In addition to research facilities, it houses offices for faculty from the Stanford Cancer Center and \\"hotel space\\" offices for visiting researchers. Academic programs and students The School of Medicine has reversed the traditional teaching method of classroom time being reserved for lectures and problem-solving exercises being completed outside of school as homework; with funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, school leaders are heading up a collaboration on the use of the \\"flipped classroom\\" approach to content delivery. The School of Medicine also has a long history of educating physician assistants (PAs). Stanford University partnered with Foothill College in 1971 to form the Primary Care Associate Program (PCAP) which has graduated more than 1,500 PAs. The last PCAP class graduated in 2018. Today, the Stanford School of Medicine offers a Master of Science in PA Studies program that seeks to train highly qualified clinical PAs who can practice in any area of medicine and also be leaders in community health, research, and medical education. The program offers a novel approach to curriculum delivery and expanded clinical opportunities as well as interprofessional education, with PA students taking courses side by side with MD students. The program is 30 months in length, accepts 27 students each year, has an acceptance rate of less than 2%. Rankings and admissions In the 2021 U.S. News & World Report rankings, Stanford was ranked fourth in the nation among medical schools for research. Admission to the MD program at Stanford is highly competitive: in 2019, 6,894 people applied, 422 were interviewed, and 175 accepted for 90 spots. Stanford is one of several schools in the United States to use the multiple mini-interview system, developed at McMaster University Medical School in Canada, to evaluate candidates. Along with the School of Humanities and Science, the Stanford School of Medicine also runs the Biosciences PhD Program, which was ranked first in 2019 among graduate programs in the biological sciences by the US News and World Report. In its graduate school specialties, according to U.S. News for 2019, Stanford is #1 in genetics, genomics, and bioinformatics, #1 in neuroscience and neurobiology, #1 in cell biology, #3 in biochemistry, biophysics, and structural biology, and #4 in ecology and evolutionary biology.

Behind him are (left to right) Stanislav Kosior, Anastas Mikoyan, Andrei Andreev and Joseph Stalin. Lysenkoism () was a political campaign led by Trofim Lysenko against genetics and science-based agriculture in the mid-20th century, rejecting natural selection in favour of Lamarckism and exaggerated claims for the benefits of vernalization and grafting. Lysenko served as the director of the Soviet Union's Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences. In time, it has come to be identified as any deliberate distortion of scientific facts or theories for purposes that are deemed politically, religiously or socially desirable. The government of the USSR supported the campaign, and Joseph Stalin personally edited a speech by Lysenko in a way that reflected his support for what would come to be known as Lysenkoism, despite his skepticism toward Lysenko's assertion that all science is class-oriented in nature. More than 3,000 mainstream biologists were dismissed or imprisoned, and numerous scientists were executed in the campaign to suppress scientific opponents. The president of the Agriculture Academy, Nikolai Vavilov, who had encouraged Lysenko, was sent to prison and died there, while Soviet genetics research was effectively destroyed. Research and teaching in the fields of neurophysiology, cell biology, and many other biological disciplines were harmed or banned. Other countries of the Eastern Bloc including Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic accepted Lysenkoism as the official \\"new biology\\", to varying degrees, as did the People's Republic of China for some years. Context August Weismann's germ plasm theory stated that the hereditary material, the germ plasm, is transmitted only by the reproductive organs. Somatic cells (of the body) develop afresh in each generation from the germ plasm. There is no way that changes made to somatic cells can affect the next generation, contrary to Lamarckism. Mendelian genetics, the science of heredity, developed into an experimentally-based field of biology at the start of the 20th century through the work of August Weismann, Thomas Hunt Morgan, and others, building on the rediscovered work of Gregor Mendel. They showed that the characteristics of an organism were carried by inherited genes, which were located on chromosomes in each cell's nucleus. These could be affected by random changes, mutations, and could be shuffled and recombined during sexual reproduction, but were otherwise passed on unchanged from parent to offspring. Beneficial changes could spread through a population by natural selection or, in agriculture, by plant breeding. In contrast, Lamarckism proposes that an organism can somehow pass on characteristics that it has acquired during its lifetime to its offspring, implying that change in the body can affect the genetic material in the germ line. Marxism‚ÄìLeninism postulated \\"universal and immutable laws of history\\" (historical materialism and dialectical materialism), which assumed unavoidable large-scale change at the collective level of societies. Collectivism was a key feature of Marxism; Darwin's concept of a random mutation in an individual being able to propagate and transform subsequent generations was at odds with the ideology, and was perceived as having a strong liberal inclination. Marxist-Leninist theorists presented Lysenkoism as a new branch of biology, arguing that \\"dialectic method shows that development is carried out in a dual form: evolutionary and revolutionary\\". Darwin was attributed with discovering \\"only the evolutionary\\" path, while Michurin and Lysenko were presented as making a \\"great step forward\\" toward the discovery of a \\"revolutionary\\" path of biologic development. Soviet agriculture around 1930 was in a crisis due to the forced collectivisation of farms, and the extermination of the kulak peasant farmers. The resulting famine in 1932‚Äì33 provoked the government to search for a solution to the critical lack of food. Lysenko's attack on the \\"bourgeois pseudoscience\\" of modern genetics and the proposal that plants can rapidly adjust to a changed environment suited the ideological battle in both agriculture and Soviet society. State media published enthusiastic articles such as \\"Siberia is transformed into land of orchards and gardens\\", \\"Soviet people change nature\\" while anyone opposing Lysenko was presented as a defender of \\"mysticism, obscurantism and backwardness\\". In the Soviet Union=Lysenko's claims Lysenko in 1938 In 1928, rejecting natural selection and Mendelian genetics, Trofim Lysenko claimed to have developed agricultural techniques which could radically increase crop yields. These included vernalization, species transformation, inheritance of acquired characteristics, and vegetative hybridization. He claimed in particular that vernalization, exposing wheat seeds to humidity and low temperature, could greatly increase crop yield. However, the technique was not new, and it did not produce anything like the yields he promised. He claimed further that he could transform one species, Triticum durum (pasta wheat, a spring wheat) into another, Triticum vulgare (bread wheat, an autumn wheat), by 2‚Äì4 years of autumn planting. Since T. durum is tetraploid with 28 chromosomes (4 sets of 7), and T. vulgare is hexaploid with 42 chromosomes (6 sets), Western geneticists at that time already knew this was impossible. Lysenkoist vegetative hybridisation. The mechanism would imply an effect of scion on stock when a fruit tree is grafted, either Lamarckian or (to 21st century biologists) horizontal gene transfer. Lysenko further claimed that Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics occurred in plants, as in the \\"eyes\\" of potato tubers, though the genetic differences in these plant parts were already known to be somatic mutations. He also claimed that when a tree is grafted, the scion permanently changes the heritable characteristics of the stock. This would constitute vegetative hybridization, which Yongsheng Liu and colleagues note could possibly occur by horizontal gene transfer. Rise Isaak Izrailevich Prezent brought Lysenko to public attention, using Soviet propaganda to portray him as a genius who had developed a new, revolutionary agricultural technique. Lysenko's resulting popularity gave him a platform to denounce theoretical genetics and to promote his own agricultural practices. He was, in turn, supported by the Soviet propaganda machine, which overstated his successes, cited faked experimental results, and omitted mention of his failures. Lysenko in the field with his wheat, which he claimed would yield more if exposed to cold Lysenko's political success was mostly due to his appeal to the Communist Party and Soviet ideology. Following the disastrous collectivization efforts of the late 1920s, Lysenko's \\"new\\" methods were seen by Soviet officials as paving the way to an \\"agricultural revolution.\\" Lysenko himself was from a peasant family, and was an enthusiastic advocate of Leninism. The Party-controlled newspapers applauded Lysenko's \\"practical\\" efforts and questioned the motives of his critics. Lysenko's \\"revolution in agriculture\\" had a powerful propaganda advantage over the academics, who urged the patience and observation required for science. Lysenko was admitted into the hierarchy of the Communist Party, and was put in charge of agricultural affairs. He used his position to denounce biologists as \\"fly-lovers and people haters\\",Epistemology and the Social, Evandro Agazzi, Javier Echeverr√≠a, Amparo G√≥mez Rodr√≠guez, Rodopi, 2008, \\"Philosophy\\", p. 149 and to decry the \\"wreckers\\" in biology, who he claimed were trying to disable the Soviet economy and cause it to fail. Furthermore, he denied the distinction between theoretical and applied biology and concepts such as control groups and statistics in general: Lysenko presented himself as a follower of Ivan Vladimirovich Michurin, a well-known and well-liked Soviet horticulturist, but unlike Michurin, he advocated a form of Lamarckism, insisting on using only hybridization and grafting, as non-genetic techniques. Support from Joseph Stalin increased Lysenko's momentum and popularity. In 1935, Lysenko compared his opponents in biology to the peasants who still resisted the Soviet government's collectivization strategy, saying that by opposing his theories the traditional geneticists were setting themselves against Marxism. Stalin was in the audience when this speech was made, and he was the first one to stand and applaud, calling out \\"Bravo, Comrade Lysenko. Bravo.\\" This emboldened Lysenko, and gave him and Prezent free rein to slander any geneticists who still spoke out against him. Many of Lysenkoism's opponents, such as his former mentor Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov, were imprisoned or executed because of their denunciations. On August 7, 1948, at the end of a week-long session organised by Lysenko and approved by Stalin, the V.I. Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences announced that from that point on Lysenkoism would be taught as \\"the only correct theory\\". Soviet scientists were forced to denounce any work that contradicted Lysenko. Criticism of Lysenko was denounced as \\"bourgeois\\" or \\"fascist\\", and analogous \\"non-bourgeois\\" theories also flourished in other fields such as linguistics and art in the Soviet academy at this time. Perhaps the only opponents of Lysenkoism during Stalin's lifetime to escape liquidation were from the small community of Soviet nuclear physicists: as Tony Judt has observed, \\"It is significant that Stalin left his nuclear physicists alone and never presumed to second guess their calculations. Stalin may well have been mad but he was not stupid.\\" Effects From 1934 to 1940, under Lysenko's admonitions and with Stalin's approval, many geneticists were executed (including Isaak Agol, Solomon Levit, Grigorii Levitskii, Georgii Karpechenko and Georgii Nadson) or sent to labor camps. The famous Soviet geneticist and president of the Agriculture Academy, Nikolai Vavilov, was arrested in 1940 and died in prison in 1943. In 1936, the American geneticist Hermann Joseph Muller, who had moved to the Leningrad Institute of Genetics with his Drosophila fruit flies, was criticized as a bourgeois, capitalist, imperialist, and promoter of fascism, so he left the USSR, returning to America via Republican Spain. In 1948, genetics was officially declared \\"a bourgeois pseudoscience\\". Over 3,000 biologists were imprisoned, fired, or executed for attempting to oppose Lysenkoism and genetics research was effectively destroyed until the death of Stalin in 1953. Due to Lysenkoism, crop yields in the USSR actually declined. Fall At the end of 1952, the situation started to change, and newspapers published articles criticizing Lysenkoism. However, the process of return to regular genetics slowed down in Nikita Khrushchev's time, when Lysenko showed him the supposed successes of an experimental agricultural complex. It was once again forbidden to criticize Lysenkoism, though it was now possible to express different views, and the geneticists imprisoned under Stalin were released or rehabilitated posthumously. The ban was finally waived in the mid-1960s. In the West, meanwhile, Lysenkoism increasingly became seen as pseudoscience. Reappearance In the 21st century, Lysenkoism is again being discussed in Russia, including in \\"respectable\\" newspapers like Kultura and by biologists. The geneticist Lev Zhivotovsky has made the unsupported claim that Lysenko helped to found modern developmental biology. which cites Discoveries in the field of epigenetics were sometimes raised as alleged late confirmation of Lysenko theory, but in spite of the apparent high-level similarity (heritable traits passed without DNA alterations), Lysenko believed that environment- induced changes are the primary mechanism of heritability, rather than DNA whose existence he denied. Heritable epigenetic effects were found but are minor as compared to genetic and often unstable. In other countries Other countries of the Eastern Bloc accepted Lysenkoism as the official \\"new biology\\", to varying degrees. In communist Poland Lysenkoism was aggressively pushed by state propaganda. State newspapers attacked \\"damage caused by bourgeois Mendelism-Morganism\\", \\"imperialist genetics\\", compared it to Mein Kampf, and printed articles like \\"French scientists recognize superiority of Soviet science\\" by Pierre Daix, a French communist and chief editor of Les Lettres Fran√ßaises, indending to create an impression that Lysenkoism was already accepted by the whole progressive world. The scientific community, however, opposed the introduction of Lysenkoism. Some academics accepted it for political reasons, with Wac≈Çaw Gajewski being a notable and vocal opponent to forced introduction of Lysenkoism into universities. As result he was denied contact with students, but was able to continue his scientific work at the Warsaw botanical garden. Lysenkoism was rapidly rejected from 1956 and the first department of genetics, at the University of Warsaw, was founded in 1958 with Gajewski as its head. Communist Czechoslovakia adopted Lysenkoism in 1949. Jaroslav K≈ô√≠≈æeneck√Ω (1896‚Äì1964) was one of the prominent Czechoslovak geneticists opposing Lysenkoism, and when he criticized Lysenkoism in his lectures, he was dismissed from the Agricultural University in 1949 for \\"serving the established capitalistic system, considering himself superior to the working class, and being hostile to the democratic order of the people\\", and imprisoned in 1958. In the German Democratic Republic, although Lysenkoism was taught at some of the universities, it had very little impact on science due to the actions of a few scientists (for example, the geneticist and fierce critic of Lysenkoism, Hans Stubbe) and information exchange with West Berlin research institutions. Nonetheless, Lysenkoist theories were found in schoolbooks as late as the dismissal of Nikita Khrushchev in 1964. Lysenkoism dominated Chinese science from 1949 until 1956, particularly during the Great Leap Forward, when, during a genetics symposium opponents of Lysenkoism were permitted to freely criticize it and argue for Mendelian genetics. In the proceedings from the symposium, Tan Jiazhen is quoted as saying \\"Since [the] USSR started to criticize Lysenko, we have dared to criticize him too\\". For a while, both schools were permitted to coexist, although the influence of the Lysenkoists remained large for several years, contributing to Great Famine through loss of yields. Almost alone among Western scientists, John Desmond Bernal, Professor of Physics at Birkbeck College, London, a Fellow of the Royal Society, and a communist, made an aggressive public defence of Lysenko.

Originally to be named USS Pittsburgh, the ship was renamed before launch to honor the loss of the Australian cruiser during the Battle of Savo Island. USS Canberra was the first USN warship named after a foreign warship or a foreign capital city, the second being . The ship entered service in 1943, and served in the Pacific theater of World War II until she was torpedoed during the Aerial Battle of Taiwan-Okinawa and forced to return to the United States for repairs. Placed in reserve after the war, Canberra was selected for conversion into the second guided-missile carrying warship in the USN fleet. Following the conversion, she was host to the ceremony for selecting the Unknown Soldier representing World War II in 1958, undertook an eight-month round-the-world cruise in 1960, participated in the Cuban Missile Crisis naval blockade in 1962, and was deployed to the Vietnam War on five occasions between 1965 and 1969. Canberra was decommissioned in 1970, struck in 1978, and broken up in 1980. One of her propellers is preserved at the Los Angeles Maritime Museum, while the ship's bell was donated to the Australian National Maritime Museum in 2001. Construction The heavy cruiser was laid down as USS Pittsburgh by the Bethlehem Steel Company Fore River Shipyard at Quincy in Massachusetts on 3 September 1941. During construction, in recognition of the valor displayed by the Australian cruiser during the Battle of Savo Island, United States President Franklin Delano Roosevelt wished to commemorate the Australian ship's loss by naming a US ship in her honor: Pittsburgh was selected and renamed USS Canberra.Cassells, The Capital Ships: Their Battles and Their Badges, pp. 45, 129 The ship was launched on 19 April 1943 by Alice, Lady Dixon, the wife of Sir Owen Dixon, Australia's ambassador to the United States, and is one of two United States warships (the other being a Littoral Class Combat Ship)to be named after a foreign warship or a foreign capital city.Cassells, The Capital Ships: Their Battles and Their Badges, p. 45 Canberra was commissioned into the USN on 14 October 1943, Captain Alex Rieman Early, USN commanding. The Australian Government returned this tribute by naming a new destroyer, , in honor of the US stand during the Battle of Bataan. Operational history=World War II Leaving Boston in January 1944,Canberra, in Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships escorted by the destroyer , Canberra sailed to Pearl Harbor via San Diego, and joined Task Force 58 in mid-February. In late February, the ship provided bombardment support during the Battle of Eniwetok.Clark, The Fighting Canberras, p. 12 During March and April, the cruiser formed part of the carrier task group, supporting the aircraft carrier during air raids on Palaus, Yap, Ulithi, and Woleai during 31 March and 1 April. On 13 April, Canberra was again escorting when Yorktowns aircraft provided support to amphibious landings at Hollandia and Wakde. From 29 April to 1 May, the cruiser was attached to the group for air attacks on Truk; during the operation, Canberra detached to shell a Japanese airbase at Satawan. The cruiser was involved in raids on Marcus and Wake Islands during May, and in June joined operations to capture the Mariana and Palau Islands. As part of this campaign, Canberra participated in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, and shelled Japanese bases in the Bonin Islands. During August and September, the ship performed raids on the Palaus and the Philippines, provided support during the Morotai landings. Canberra underway as part of Task Force 38 in 1944 At the start of October, Canberra joined Task Force 38, which was tasked with performing air raids on Okinawa and Taiwan, in preparation for the landings at Leyte. On 13 October, an air-dropped torpedo from a Japanese aircraft hit the cruiser below her armour belt. The explosion killed 23 personnel and exposed the engineering spaces to the ocean, stalling the ship. took Canberra under tow for a rendezvous with the tug , which took over the tow after putting a salvage crew aboard. During the tow, the salvage officer from Munsee died while diving in the cruiser's flooded engine room to make temporary repairs. A week into the tow towards Ulithi, Munsee was joined by the War Shipping Administration leased tug Watch Hill. It took another week for the two tugboats to bring Canberra to the repair ship . After temporary repairs at Manus, Canberra sailed under her own power to Boston Navy Yard. The cruiser was docked for repairs, which lasted from February to October 1945. The cruiser was deployed to the west coast of the United States in late 1945. Canberra received seven battle stars for her wartime service. Boston class conversion Canberra was decommissioned on 7 March 1947 and berthed with the Pacific Reserve Fleet at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, located in Bremerton, Washington. Canberra and sister ship were marked for conversion into guided missile heavy cruisers (Canberra was redesignated with the hull number CAG-2), and on 4 January 1952, she was towed to the New York Shipbuilding Corporation at Camden, New Jersey, for conversion into a . Canberra firing a Terrier missile following her Boston class conversion During the conversion, Canberras aft 8-inch and 5-inch gun turrets were replaced with two twin RIM-2 Terrier missile launchers. Her aft superstructure was rebuilt, and the two funnels were redesigned as a single unit. The upgrade of the ship concluded in June 1956, making Canberra the second guided-missile ship in the USN fleet. If the conversion proved successful, the plan was to replace the rest of the ship's gun armament with missiles at a later date. However, by 1964, the rapid advancement of missile technology made the Terrier system obsolete, and full conversion was not pursued. Post-conversion career Canberra was recommissioned on 15 June 1956, and home ported at Norfolk, Virginia. From June until March 1957, the cruiser operated from Norfolk and through the Caribbean. On 14 March, Canberra delivered President Dwight D. Eisenhower to Bermuda for a conference with Harold Macmillan, the British Prime Minister. On 12 June, the cruiser served as review ship for the International Naval Review at Hampton Roads. After a training cruise during July and August, Canberra was deployed to the Mediterranean for NATO Operation Strikeback.

In mid-April 1958, Boston and Canberra hosted change of command ceremonies in which Rear Admiral Charles B. Martell relieved Rear Admiral Charles L. Melson as Commander Cruiser Division Four at Norfolk Naval Base. On 26 May, the ceremony for the selection of the Unknown Soldier representing World War II occurred aboard Canberra.Clark, The Fighting Canberras, pp. 12‚Äì13 From June to August, the cruiser sailed on another training cruise, before docking at Norfolk Naval Shipyard for overhaul. From 3 March until 24 October 1960, the cruiser made an 8-month round-the-world cruise to show the flag and demonstrate her missile capabilities to U.S. and Allied forces.Clark, The Fighting Canberras, p. 13 During the voyage, she flew the flag of Rear Admiral J. McN. Taylor, Commander of the Atlantic Fleet Cruiser Force and Cruiser Division 6. During this deployment, the ship visited the site of her Australian cruiser namesake's sinking, along with locations where the American cruiser had herself served during World War II. Canberra off the coast of South Vietnam during her 1966 WESTPAC cruise In 1962, she sailed south from Norfolk to participate in the naval blockade during the Cuban Missile Crisis.Mellefont, Two ships called Canberra, p. 6 During the Vietnam War, Canberra was home ported at San Diego. She deployed to Vietnam five times from 1965 to 1969 where her 8-inch and 5-inch guns provided support for US troops. During the deployments in 1967 and 1968, Canberra operated north of the DMZ shelling bridges, transport routes and shore installations. On 2 March 1967, the cruiser was hit by two shells fired from ashore, which caused 5 injuries and minor structural damage. On 6 April 1967, a young seaman named Doug Hegdahl was accidentally blown overboard by one of the 5-inch guns; he was captured by a North Vietnamese gunboat and imprisoned in the infamous Hanoi Hilton. Hegdahl's recollections of his time there would later serve as proof of torture committed by the North Vietnamese at POW camps. At the conclusion of her second tour of duty in April 1967, the cruiser visited Melbourne, and was in Australian waters in May for commemorations of the Battle of the Coral Sea. During the 1968 Tet Offensive, Canberra went south to support the troops at Hue and fired 35,000 rounds in 31 days. On 1 May 1968, Canberra returned to her original hull number of CA-70; following the obsolescence of her missile armament, her 8-inch guns were reclassified as the cruiser's main armament, although the Terrier launchers were retained until decommissioning. Her last Vietnam deployment ended in early January 1969. Decommissioning and fate George W.

In its absence the plant is unable to complete a normal life cycle, or that the element is part of some essential plant constituent or metabolite. This is in accordance with Justus von Liebig's law of the minimum. The total essential plant nutrients include seventeen different elements: carbon, oxygen and hydrogen which are absorbed from the air, whereas other nutrients including nitrogen are typically obtained from the soil (exceptions include some parasitic or carnivorous plants). Plants must obtain the following mineral nutrients from their growing medium:- * the macronutrients: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), sulfur (S), magnesium (Mg), carbon (C), oxygen (O), hydrogen (H) * the micronutrients (or trace minerals): iron (Fe), boron (B), chlorine (Cl), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni) These elements stay beneath soil as salts, so plants consume these elements as ions. The macronutrients are consumed in larger quantities; hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and carbon contribute to over 95% of a plant's entire biomass on a dry matter weight basis. Micronutrients are present in plant tissue in quantities measured in parts per million, ranging from 0.1 to 200 ppm, or less than 0.02% dry weight. Most soil conditions across the world can provide plants adapted to that climate and soil with sufficient nutrition for a complete life cycle, without the addition of nutrients as fertilizer. However, if the soil is cropped it is necessary to artificially modify soil fertility through the addition of fertilizer to promote vigorous growth and increase or sustain yield. This is done because, even with adequate water and light, nutrient deficiency can limit growth and crop yield. Processes Plants take up essential elements from the soil through their roots and from the air (mainly consisting of nitrogen and oxygen) through their leaves. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by cation exchange, wherein root hairs pump hydrogen ions (H+) into the soil through proton pumps. These hydrogen ions displace cations attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. In the leaves, stomata open to take in carbon dioxide and expel oxygen. The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in photosynthesis. The root, especially the root hair, is the essential organ for the uptake of nutrients. The structure and architecture of the root can alter the rate of nutrient uptake. Nutrient ions are transported to the center of the root, the stele, in order for the nutrients to reach the conducting tissues, xylem and phloem. The Casparian strip, a cell wall outside the stele but within the root, prevents passive flow of water and nutrients, helping to regulate the uptake of nutrients and water. Xylem moves water and mineral ions within the plant and phloem accounts for organic molecule transportation. Water potential plays a key role in a plant's nutrient uptake. If the water potential is more negative within the plant than the surrounding soils, the nutrients will move from the region of higher solute concentration‚Äîin the soil‚Äîto the area of lower solute concentration - in the plant. There are three fundamental ways plants uptake nutrients through the root: # Simple diffusion occurs when a nonpolar molecule, such as O2, CO2, and NH3 follows a concentration gradient, moving passively through the cell lipid bilayer membrane without the use of transport proteins. # Facilitated diffusion is the rapid movement of solutes or ions following a concentration gradient, facilitated by transport proteins. # Active transport is the uptake by cells of ions or molecules against a concentration gradient; this requires an energy source, usually ATP, to power molecular pumps that move the ions or molecules through the membrane. Nutrients can be moved within plants to where they are most needed. For example, a plant will try to supply more nutrients to its younger leaves than to its older ones. When nutrients are mobile within the plant, symptoms of any deficiency become apparent first on the older leaves. However, not all nutrients are equally mobile. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are mobile nutrients while the others have varying degrees of mobility. When a less-mobile nutrient is deficient, the younger leaves suffer because the nutrient does not move up to them but stays in the older leaves. This phenomenon is helpful in determining which nutrients a plant may be lacking. Many plants engage in symbiosis with microorganisms. Two important types of these relationship are # with bacteria such as rhizobia, that carry out biological nitrogen fixation, in which atmospheric nitrogen (N2) is converted into ammonium (NH); and # with mycorrhizal fungi, which through their association with the plant roots help to create a larger effective root surface area. Both of these mutualistic relationships enhance nutrient uptake. The Earth's atmosphere contains over 78 percent nitrogen. Plants called legumes, including the agricultural crops alfalfa and soybeans, widely grown by farmers, harbour nitrogen-fixing bacteria that can convert atmopheric nitrogen into nitrogen the plant can use. Plants not classified as legumes such as wheat, corn and rice rely on nitrogen compounds present in the soil to support their growth. These can be supplied by mineralization of soil organic matter or added plant residues, nitrogen fixing bacteria, animal waste, through the breaking of triple bonded N2 molecules by lightning strikes or through the application of fertilizers. Functions of nutrients At least 17 elements are known to be essential nutrients for plants. In relatively large amounts, the soil supplies nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur; these are often called the macronutrients. In relatively small amounts, the soil supplies iron, manganese, boron, molybdenum, copper, zinc, chlorine, and cobalt, the so-called micronutrients. Nutrients must be available not only in sufficient amounts but also in appropriate ratios. Plant nutrition is a difficult subject to understand completely, partially because of the variation between different plants and even between different species or individuals of a given clone. Elements present at low levels may cause deficiency symptoms, and toxicity is possible at levels that are too high. Furthermore, deficiency of one element may present as symptoms of toxicity from another element, and vice versa. An abundance of one nutrient may cause a deficiency of another nutrient. For example, K+ uptake can be influenced by the amount of NH available. Nitrogen is plentiful in the Earth's atmosphere, and a number of commercially-important agricultural plants engage in nitrogen fixation (conversion of atmospheric nitrogen to a biologically useful form). However, plants mostly receive their nitrogen through the soil, where it is already converted in biological useful form. This is important because the nitrogen in the atmosphere is too large for the plant to consume, and takes a lot of energy to convert into smaller forms. These include soybeans, edible beans and peas as well as clovers and alfalfa used primarily for feeding livestock. Plants such as the commercially- important corn, wheat, oats, barley and rice require nitrogen compounds to be present in the soil in which they grow. Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. Green plants ordinarily obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of photosynthesis. Each of these nutrients is used in a different place for a different essential function.  Macronutrients (derived from air and water) Carbon= Carbon forms the backbone of most plant biomolecules, including proteins, starches and cellulose. Carbon is fixed through photosynthesis; this converts carbon dioxide from the air into carbohydrates which are used to store and transport energy within the plant. =Hydrogen= Hydrogen is necessary for building sugars and building the plant. It is obtained almost entirely from water. Hydrogen ions are imperative for a proton gradient to help drive the electron transport chain in photosynthesis and for respiration. =Oxygen= Oxygen is a component of many organic and inorganic molecules within the plant, and is acquired in many forms. These include: O2 and CO2 (mainly from the air via leaves) and H2O, NO, H2PO and SO (mainly from the soil water via roots). Plants produce oxygen gas (O2) along with glucose during photosynthesis but then require O2 to undergo aerobic cellular respiration and break down this glucose to produce ATP. Macronutrients (primary)Nitrogen= Nitrogen is a major constituent of several of the most important plant substances. For example, nitrogen compounds comprise 40% to 50% of the dry matter of protoplasm, and it is a constituent of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. It is also an essential constituent of chlorophyll. Nitrogen deficiency most often results in stunted growth, slow growth, and chlorosis. Nitrogen deficient plants will also exhibit a purple appearance on the stems, petioles and underside of leaves from an accumulation of anthocyanin pigments. Most of the nitrogen taken up by plants is from the soil in the forms of NO, although in acid environments such as boreal forests where nitrification is less likely to occur, ammonium NH is more likely to be the dominating source of nitrogen. Amino acids and proteins can only be built from NH, so NO must be reduced. In many agricultural settings, nitrogen is the limiting nutrient for rapid growth. Nitrogen is transported via the xylem from the roots to the leaf canopy as nitrate ions, or in an organic form, such as amino acids or amides. Nitrogen can also be transported in the phloem sap as amides, amino acids and ureides; it is therefore mobile within the plant, and the older leaves exhibit chlorosis and necrosis earlier than the younger leaves. There is an abundant supply of nitrogen in the earth's atmosphere ‚Äî N2 gas comprises nearly 79% of air. However, N2 is unavailable for use by most organisms because there is a triple bond between the two nitrogen atoms in the molecule, making it almost inert. In order for nitrogen to be used for growth it must be ‚Äúfixed‚Äù (combined) in the form of ammonium (NH) or nitrate (NO) ions. The weathering of rocks releases these ions so slowly that it has a negligible effect on the availability of fixed nitrogen. Therefore, nitrogen is often the limiting factor for growth and biomass production in all environments where there is a suitable climate and availability of water to support life. Nitrogen enters the plant largely through the roots. A ‚Äúpool‚Äù of soluble nitrogen accumulates. Its composition within a species varies widely depending on several factors, including day length, time of day, night temperatures, nutrient deficiencies, and nutrient imbalance. Short day length promotes asparagine formation, whereas glutamine is produced under long day regimes. Darkness favors protein breakdown accompanied by high asparagine accumulation. Night temperature modifies the effects due to night length, and soluble nitrogen tends to accumulate owing to retarded synthesis and breakdown of proteins. Low night temperature conserves glutamine; high night temperature increases accumulation of asparagine because of breakdown. Deficiency of K accentuates differences between long- and short-day plants. The pool of soluble nitrogen is much smaller than in well-nourished plants when N and P are deficient since uptake of nitrate and further reduction and conversion of N to organic forms is restricted more than is protein synthesis. Deficiencies of Ca, K, and S affect the conversion of organic N to protein more than uptake and reduction. The size of the pool of soluble N is no guide per se to growth rate, but the size of the pool in relation to total N might be a useful ratio in this regard. Nitrogen availability in the rooting medium also affects the size and structure of tracheids formed in the long lateral roots of white spruce (Krasowski and Owens 1999). Microorganisms have a central role in almost all aspects of nitrogen availability, and therefore for life support on earth. Some bacteria can convert N2 into ammonia by the process termed nitrogen fixation; these bacteria are either free-living or form symbiotic associations with plants or other organisms (e.g., termites, protozoa), while other bacteria bring about transformations of ammonia to nitrate, and of nitrate to N2 or other nitrogen gases. Many bacteria and fungi degrade organic matter, releasing fixed nitrogen for reuse by other organisms. All these processes contribute to the nitrogen cycle. =Phosphorus= Like nitrogen, phosphorus is involved with many vital plant processes. Within a plant, it is present mainly as a structural component of the nucleic acids: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA), as well as a constituent of fatty phospholipids, that are important in membrane development and function. It is present in both organic and inorganic forms, both of which are readily translocated within the plant. All energy transfers in the cell are critically dependent on phosphorus. As with all living things, phosphorus is part of the Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is of immediate use in all processes that require energy with the cells. Phosphorus can also be used to modify the activity of various enzymes by phosphorylation, and is used for cell signaling. Phosphorus is concentrated at the most actively growing points of a plant and stored within seeds in anticipation of their germination. Phosphorus is most commonly found in the soil in the form of polyprotic phosphoric acid (H3PO4), but is taken up most readily in the form of H2PO. Phosphorus is available to plants in limited quantities in most soils because it is released very slowly from insoluble phosphates and is rapidly fixed once again. Under most environmental conditions it is the element that limits growth because of this constriction and due to its high demand by plants and microorganisms. Plants can increase phosphorus uptake by a mutualism with mycorrhiza. A Phosphorus deficiency in plants is characterized by an intense green coloration or reddening in leaves due to lack of chlorophyll. If the plant is experiencing high phosphorus deficiencies the leaves may become denatured and show signs of death. Occasionally the leaves may appear purple from an accumulation of anthocyanin. Because phosphorus is a mobile nutrient, older leaves will show the first signs of deficiency. On some soils, the phosphorus nutrition of some conifers, including the spruces, depends on the ability of mycorrhizae to take up, and make soil phosphorus available to the tree, hitherto unobtainable to the non-mycorrhizal root. Seedling white spruce, greenhouse-grown in sand testing negative for phosphorus, were very small and purple for many months until spontaneous mycorrhizal inoculation, the effect of which was manifested by a greening of foliage and the development of vigorous shoot growth. Phosphorus deficiency can produce symptoms similar to those of nitrogen deficiency, but as noted by Russel: ‚ÄúPhosphate deficiency differs from nitrogen deficiency in being extremely difficult to diagnose, and crops can be suffering from extreme starvation without there being any obvious signs that lack of phosphate is the cause‚Äù. Russell's observation applies to at least some coniferous seedlings, but Benzian found that although response to phosphorus in very acid forest tree nurseries in England was consistently high, no species (including Sitka spruce) showed any visible symptom of deficiency other than a slight lack of lustre. Phosphorus levels have to be exceedingly low before visible symptoms appear in such seedlings. In sand culture at 0 ppm phosphorus, white spruce seedlings were very small and tinted deep purple; at 0.62 ppm, only the smallest seedlings were deep purple; at 6.2 ppm, the seedlings were of good size and color.Swan, H.S.D. 1962. The scientific use of fertilizers in forestry. p. 13-24 in La Fertilisation Foresti√®re au Canada. Fonds de Recherches Foresti√®res, Laval Univ., Quebec QC, Bull. 5 It is useful to apply a high phosphorus content fertilizer, such as bone meal, to perennials to help with successful root formation. =Potassium= Unlike other major elements, potassium does not enter into the composition of any of the important plant constituents involved in metabolism, but it does occur in all parts of plants in substantial amounts. It seems to be of particular importance in leaves and at growing points. Potassium is outstanding among the nutrient elements for its mobility and solubility within plant tissues. Processes involving potassium include the formation of carbohydrates and proteins, the regulation of internal plant moisture, as a catalyst and condensing agent of complex substances, as an accelerator of enzyme action, and as contributor to photosynthesis, especially under low light intensity. Potassium regulates the opening and closing of the stomata by a potassium ion pump. Since stomata are important in water regulation, potassium regulates water loss from the leaves and increases drought tolerance. Potassium deficiency may cause necrosis or interveinal chlorosis. The potassium ion (K+) is highly mobile and can aid in balancing the anion (negative) charges within the plant. Potassium helps in fruit coloration, shape and also increases its brix. Hence, quality fruits are produced in potassium-rich soils. Potassium serves as an activator of enzymes used in photosynthesis and respiration. Potassium is used to build cellulose and aids in photosynthesis by the formation of a chlorophyll precursor. Potassium deficiency may result in higher risk of pathogens, wilting, chlorosis, brown spotting, and higher chances of damage from frost and heat. When soil-potassium levels are high, plants take up more potassium than needed for healthy growth. The term luxury consumption has been applied to this. When potassium is moderately deficient, the effects first appear in the older tissues, and from there progress towards the growing points. Acute deficiency severely affects growing points, and die-back commonly occurs. Symptoms of potassium deficiency in white spruce include: browning and death of needles (chlorosis); reduced growth in height and diameter; impaired retention of needles; and reduced needle length. A relationship between potassium nutrition and cold resistance has been found in several tree species, including two species of spruce. Macronutrients (secondary and tertiary)Sulfur= Sulfur is a structural component of some amino acids (including cystein and methionine) and vitamins, and is essential for chloroplast growth and function; it is found in the iron-sulfur complexes of the electron transport chains in photosynthesis. It is needed for N2 fixation by legumes, and the conversion of nitrate into amino acids and then into protein. In plants, sulfur cannot be mobilized from older leaves for new growth, so deficiency symptoms are seen in the youngest tissues first. Symptoms of deficiency include yellowing of leaves and stunted growth. =Calcium= Calcium regulates transport of other nutrients into the plant and is also involved in the activation of certain plant enzymes. Calcium deficiency results in stunting. This nutrient is involved in photosynthesis and plant structure. Blossom end rot is also a result of inadequate calcium. Another common symptom of calcium deficiency in leaves is the curling of the leaf towards the veins or center of the leaf. Many times this can also have a blackened appearance Calcium has been found to have a positive effect in combating salinity in soils. It has been shown to ameliorate the negative effects that salinity has such as reduced water usage of plants. Calcium in plants occurs chiefly in the leaves, with lower concentrations in seeds, fruits, and roots. A major function is as a constituent of cell walls. When coupled with certain acidic compounds of the jelly-like pectins of the middle lamella, calcium forms an insoluble salt. It is also intimately involved in meristems, and is particularly important in root development, with roles in cell division, cell elongation, and the detoxification of hydrogen ions. Other functions attributed to calcium are; the neutralization of organic acids; inhibition of some potassium-activated ions; and a role in nitrogen absorption. A notable feature of calcium-deficient plants is a defective root system. Roots are usually affected before above-ground parts. =Magnesium= The outstanding role of magnesium in plant nutrition is as a constituent of the chlorophyll molecule. As a carrier, it is also involved in numerous enzyme reactions as an effective activator, in which it is closely associated with energy-supplying phosphorus compounds. Magnesium is very mobile in plants, and, like potassium, when deficient is translocated from older to younger tissues, so that signs of deficiency appear first on the oldest tissues and then spread progressively to younger tissues.  Micro- nutrients  Plants are able sufficiently to accumulate most trace elements. Some plants are sensitive indicators of the chemical environment in which they grow (Dunn 1991), and some plants have barrier mechanisms that exclude or limit the uptake of a particular element or ion species, e.g., alder twigs commonly accumulate molybdenum but not arsenic, whereas the reverse is true of spruce bark (Dunn 1991). Otherwise, a plant can integrate the geochemical signature of the soil mass permeated by its root system together with the contained groundwaters. Sampling is facilitated by the tendency of many elements to accumulate in tissues at the plant's extremities. =Iron= Iron is necessary for photosynthesis and is present as an enzyme cofactor in plants. Iron deficiency can result in interveinal chlorosis and necrosis. Iron is not a structural part of chlorophyll but very much essential for its synthesis. Copper deficiency can be responsible for promoting an iron deficiency. It helps in the electron transport of plant. =Molybdenum= Molybdenum is a cofactor to enzymes important in building amino acids and is involved in nitrogen metabolism. Molybdenum is part of the nitrate reductase enzyme (needed for the reduction of nitrate) and the nitrogenase enzyme (required for biological nitrogen fixation). Reduced productivity as a result of molybdenum deficiency is usually associated with the reduced activity of one or more of these enzymes. =Boron= Boron is absorbed by plants in the form of the anion BO. It is available to plants in moderately soluble mineral forms of Ca, Mg and Na borates and the highly soluble form of organic compounds. It is available to plants over a range of pH, from 5.0 to 7.5. It is mobile in the soil, hence, it is prone to leaching. Leaching removes substantial amounts of boron in sandy soil, but little in fine silt or clay soil. Boron's fixation to those minerals at high pH can render boron unavailable, while low pH frees the fixed boron, leaving it prone to leaching in wet climates. It precipitates with other minerals in the form of borax in which form it was first used over 400 years ago as a soil supplement. Decomposition of organic material causes boron to be deposited in the topmost soil layer. When soil dries it can cause a precipitous drop in the availability of boron to plants as the plants cannot draw nutrients from that desiccated layer. Hence, boron deficiency diseases appear in dry weather. Boron has many functions within a plant: it affects flowering and fruiting, pollen germination, cell division, and active salt absorption. The metabolism of amino acids and proteins, carbohydrates, calcium, and water are strongly affected by boron. Many of those listed functions may be embodied by its function in moving the highly polar sugars through cell membranes by reducing their polarity and hence the energy needed to pass the sugar. If sugar cannot pass to the fastest growing parts rapidly enough, those parts die. Boron is not relocatable in the plant via the phloem. It must be supplied to the growing parts via the xylem. Foliar sprays affect only those parts sprayed, which may be insufficient for the fastest growing parts, and is very temporary. Boron is essential for the proper forming and strengthening of cell walls. Lack of boron results in short thick cells producing stunted fruiting bodies and roots. Calcium to boron ratio must be maintained in a narrow range for normal plant growth. For alfalfa, that calcium to boron ratio must be from 80:1 to 600:1. Boron deficiency appears at 800:1 and higher. Boron levels within plants differ with plant species and range from 2.3 mg/kg for barley to 94.7 mg/kg for poppy. Lack of boron causes failure of calcium metabolism which produces hollow heart in beets and peanuts. Inadequate amounts of boron affect many agricultural crops, legume forage crops most strongly. Of the micronutrients, boron deficiencies are second most common after zinc. Deficiency results in the death of the terminal growing points and stunted growth. Boron supplements derive from dry lake bed deposits such as those in Death Valley, USA, in the form of sodium tetraborate (borax), from which less soluble calcium borate is made. Foliar sprays are used on fruit crop trees in soils of high alkalinity. Boron is often applied to fields as a contaminant in other soil amendments but is not generally adequate to make up the rate of loss by cropping. The rates of application of borate to produce an adequate alfalfa crop range from 15 pounds per acre for a sandy-silt, acidic soil of low organic matter, to 60 pounds per acre for a soil with high organic matter, high cation exchange capacity and high pH. Boron concentration in soil water solution higher than one ppm is toxic to most plants. Toxic concentrations within plants are 10 to 50 ppm for small grains and 200 ppm in boron-tolerant crops such as sugar beets, rutabaga, cucumbers, and conifers. Toxic soil conditions are generally limited to arid regions or can be caused by underground borax deposits in contact with water or volcanic gases dissolved in percolating water. Application rates should be limited to a few pounds per acre in a test plot to determine if boron is needed generally. Otherwise, testing for boron levels in plant material is required to determine remedies. Excess boron can be removed by irrigation and assisted by application of elemental sulfur to lower the pH and increase boron solubility. Boron deficiencies can be detected by analysis of plant material to apply a correction before the obvious symptoms appear, after which it is too late to prevent crop loss. Strawberries deficient in boron will produce lumpy fruit; apricots will not blossom or, if they do, will not fruit or will drop their fruit depending on the level of boron deficit. Broadcast of boron supplements is effective and long term; a foliar spray is immediate but must be repeated. =Copper= Copper is important for photosynthesis. Symptoms for copper deficiency include chlorosis. It is involved in many enzyme processes; necessary for proper photosynthesis; involved in the manufacture of lignin (cell walls) and involved in grain production. It is also hard to find in some soil conditions. =Manganese= Manganese is necessary for photosynthesis, including the building of chloroplasts. Manganese deficiency may result in coloration abnormalities, such as discolored spots on the foliage. =Sodium= Sodium is involved in the regeneration of phosphoenolpyruvate in CAM and C4 plants. Sodium can potentially replace potassium's regulation of stomatal opening and closing. Essentiality of sodium: * Essential for C4 plants rather C3 * Substitution of K by Na: Plants can be classified into four groups: # Group A‚Äîa high proportion of K can be replaced by Na and stimulate the growth, which cannot be achieved by the application of K # Group B‚Äîspecific growth responses to Na are observed but they are much less distinct # Group C‚ÄîOnly minor substitution is possible and Na has no effect # Group D‚ÄîNo substitution occurs * Stimulate the growth‚Äîincrease leaf area and stomata. Improves the water balance * Na functions in metabolism # C4 metabolism # Impair the conversion of pyruvate to phosphoenol-pyruvate # Reduce the photosystem II activity and ultrastructural changes in mesophyll chloroplast * Replacing K functions # Internal osmoticum # Stomatal function # Photosynthesis # Counteraction in long distance transport # Enzyme activation * Improves the crop quality e.g. improves the taste of carrots by increasing sucrose =Zinc= Zinc is required in a large number of enzymes and plays an essential role in DNA transcription. A typical symptom of zinc deficiency is the stunted growth of leaves, commonly known as \\"little leaf\\" and is caused by the oxidative degradation of the growth hormone auxin. =Nickel= In higher plants, nickel is absorbed by plants in the form of Ni2+ ion. Nickel is essential for activation of urease, an enzyme involved with nitrogen metabolism that is required to process urea. Without nickel, toxic levels of urea accumulate, leading to the formation of necrotic lesions. In lower plants, nickel activates several enzymes involved in a variety of processes, and can substitute for zinc and iron as a cofactor in some enzymes. =Chlorine= Chlorine, as compounded chloride, is necessary for osmosis and ionic balance; it also plays a role in photosynthesis. =Cobalt= Cobalt has proven to be beneficial to at least some plants although it does not appear to be essential for most species. It has, however, been shown to be essential for nitrogen fixation by the nitrogen-fixing bacteria associated with legumes and other plants. =Aluminum= Aluminum is one of the few elements capable of making soil more acidic. This is achieved by aluminum taking hydroxide ions out of water, leaving hydrogen ions behind. As a result, the soil is more acidic, which makes it unlivable for many plants. Another consequence of aluminum in soils is aluminum toxicity, which inhibits root growth. * Tea has a high tolerance for aluminum (Al) toxicity and the growth is stimulated by Al application. The possible reason is the prevention of Cu, Mn or P toxicity effects. * There have been reports that Al may serve as a fungicide against certain types of root rot. =Silicon= Silicon is not considered an essential element for plant growth and development. It is always found in abundance in the environment and hence if needed it is available. It is found in the structures of plants and improves the health of plants. In plants, silicon has been shown in experiments to strengthen cell walls, improve plant strength, health, and productivity. There have been studies showing evidence of silicon improving drought and frost resistance, decreasing lodging potential and boosting the plant's natural pest and disease fighting systems. Silicon has also been shown to improve plant vigor and physiology by improving root mass and density, and increasing above ground plant biomass and crop yields. Silicon is currently under consideration by the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials (AAPFCO) for elevation to the status of a \\"plant beneficial substance\\". =Vanadium= Vanadium may be required by some plants, but at very low concentrations. It may also be substituting for molybdenum. =Selenium= Selenium is probably not essential for flowering plants, but it can be beneficial; it can stimulate plant growth, improve tolerance of oxidative stress, and increase resistance to pathogens and herbivory. Selenium is, however, an essential mineral element for animal (including human) nutrition and selenium deficiencies are known to occur when food or animal feed is grown on selenium-deficient soils. The use of inorganic selenium fertilizers can increase selenium concentrations in edible crops and animal diets thereby improving animal health. Nutrient deficiency The effect of a nutrient deficiency can vary from a subtle depression of growth rate to obvious stunting, deformity, discoloration, distress, and even death. Visual symptoms distinctive enough to be useful in identifying a deficiency are rare. Most deficiencies are multiple and moderate. However, while a deficiency is seldom that of a single nutrient, nitrogen is commonly the nutrient in shortest supply. Chlorosis of foliage is not always due to mineral nutrient deficiency. Solarization can produce superficially similar effects, though mineral deficiency tends to cause premature defoliation, whereas solarization does not, nor does solarization depress nitrogen concentration. Researchers found that partial deficiencies of K or P did not change the fatty acid composition of phosphatidyl choline in Brassica napus L. plants. Calcium deficiency did, on the other hand, lead to a marked decline of polyunsaturated compounds that would be expected to have negative impacts for integrity of the plant membrane, that could effect some properties like its permeability, and is needed for the ion uptake activity of the root membranes. Nutrient status of plants Nutrient status (mineral nutrient and trace element composition, also called ionome and nutrient profile) of plants are commonly portrayed by tissue elementary analysis. Interpretation of the results of such studies, however, has been controversial. During recent decades the nearly two-century- old ‚Äúlaw of minimum‚Äù or ‚ÄúLiebig's law‚Äù (that states that plant growth is controlled not by the total amount of resources available, but by the scarcest resource) has been replaced by several mathematical approaches that use different models in order to take the interactions between the individual nutrients into account. Later developments in this field were based on the fact that the nutrient elements (and compounds) do not act independently from each other; Baxter, 2015, because there may be direct chemical interactions between them or they may influence each other's uptake, translocation, and biological action via a number of mechanisms as exemplified for the case of ammonia. Plant nutrition in agricultural systems=Hydroponics Hydroponics is a method for growing plants in a water-nutrient solution without the use of nutrient-rich soil. It allows researchers and home gardeners to grow their plants in a controlled environment. The most common solution is the Hoagland solution, developed by D. R. Hoagland and W. C. Snyder in 1933. The solution (known as A-Z solution) consists of all the essential nutrients in the correct proportions necessary for most plant growth. An aerator is used to prevent an anoxic event or hypoxia. Hypoxia can affect nutrient uptake of a plant because, without oxygen present, respiration becomes inhibited within the root cells. The nutrient film technique is a hydroponic technique in which the roots are not fully submerged. This allows for adequate aeration of the roots, while a \\"film\\" thin layer of nutrient-rich water is pumped through the system to provide nutrients and water to the plant.

Yupik music is the music of the Yupik peoples. Eskimo music is Inuit-Yupik music. I√±upiat music is the music of the I√±upiat. Characteristics of Inuit music include: recitative-like singing, complex rhythmic organization, relatively small melodic range averaging about a sixth, prominence of major thirds and minor seconds melodically, with undulating melodic movement.Nettl, Bruno (1956). Music in Primitive Culture, p.107. Harvard University Press. . The Copper Inuit living around Coppermine River flowing North to Coronation Gulf have generally two categories of music.

Date accessed: 01 Nov. 2011. Each pisik functions as a personal song of a drummer and is accompanied by dancing and singing. Each drummer has his own style and performs during gatherings. One drum is used in the performance of a pisik and often begins in a slow tempo, gradually building in intensity. The wooden frame drum, called a qilaut is played on the edge with a wooden beater called a qatuk. The performer tilts the drum from one side to another and dances in rhythm of the beats.ARIMA, E..

Cultural role Traditionally Inuktitut did not have a word for what a European-influenced listener or ethnomusicologist's understanding of music, \\"and ethnographic investigation seems to suggest that the concept of music as such is also absent from their culture.\\" The closest word, nipi, includes music, the sound of speech, and noise.Nattiez, Jean-Jacques (1987). Music and Discourse: Toward a Semiology of Music (Musicologie g√©n√©rale et s√©miologue, 1987). Translated by Carolyn Abbate (1990), p.56. .

(1983). \\"Music of the Alaskan Eskimos\\", Musics of Many Cultures: An Introduction, p.358. May, Elizabeth; ed. University of California. . Until the advent of commercial recording technology, Inuit music was usually used in spiritual ceremonies to ask the spirits (see Inuit mythology) for good luck in hunting or gambling, as well as simple lullabies. Inuit music has long been noted for a stoic lack of work or love songs. These musical beginnings were modified with the arrival of European sailors, especially from Scotland and Ireland. Instruments like the accordion were popularized, and dances like the jig or reel became common. Scots-Irish derived American country music has been especially popular among Inuit in the 20th century. Katajjaq Katajjaq (also pirkusirtuk and nipaquhiit) is a type of traditional competitive song, considered a game, usually held between two women. It is one of the world's few examples of overtone singing, a unique method of producing sounds that is otherwise best known in Tuvan throat-singing. When competing, two women stand face-to-face and sing using a complex method of following each other, thus that one voice hits a strong accent while the other hits a weak, melding the two voices into a nearly indistinguishable single sound. They repeat brief motifs at staggered intervals, often imitating natural sounds, like those of geese, caribou or other wildlife, until one runs out of breath, trips over her own tongue, or begins laughing, and the contest is then over. \\"The old woman who teaches the children corrects sloppy intonation of contours, poorly meshed phrase displacements, and vague rhythms exactly like a Western vocal coach.\\"Nattiez (1990), p.57. Influence from Western culture Contact with European explorers in the 16th and 17th centuries brought Western influence to Inuit music. The microtonality and rhythmic complexity of the music was replaced with structures more resembling the structures of Western music.Krejci, p. 150 Many contemporary Inuit musicians now blend aspects of traditional Inuit music with mainstream popular music genres such as rock, pop and country music.\\"Inuit pop, Algonquin rap, Innu reggae aim for mainstream\\". Agence France-Presse, 8 October 2009. Vocal games Inuit vocal games are usually played by two women facing each other in close proximity. They use the other participant's oral cavity as resonators but may also play under a kitchen pot for the resonances to be more pronounced. The game consists of repeating meaningless words in tight rhythmic canon. The strong accent of one participant coincides with the weak of the other. The breathing of the players are thus also alternated. Vocal techniques include voiced and voiceless articulations and different articulations, and different placement of sound in the chest, throat and nose areas. Vocal games are unique to the Inuit. Musical instruments=Percussion Drummer at an Inupiat dance near Nome in 1900. Drum dancing, Gjoa Haven, Nunavut, Canada, 2019 *The main percussion instrument is the wooden frame drum called the qilaut. It is made from boiling and bending strips of wood about two to three inches wide into a circular frame with a handle protruding out. Dehaired animal skin, usually caribou, is stretched across the frame and fastened down with a string. The drum can reach one meter in diameter but are usually smaller, around one yard in length. It is struck on the edge of the rim by a qatuk, or a wooden beater. The resulting sound is a combination of the percussive attack from striking the wood and the resulting vibrations from the stretched membrane. Some groups such as the Inuvialuit living around the Mackenzie Delta use wands to beat the drums instead of thick wooden beaters.\\"Music \\", InuitArtAlive.ca.

It is not clear as to whether the instrument is purely indigenous, or introduced by Nordic sailors either pre or post-Columbus. Inuit culture is one of the few New World cultures to have a chordophone tradition. *The kelutviaq is a one-string fiddle or lute played by the Yup'ik of Nelson Island and southwest Alaska Distribution The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has been broadcasting music in Inuit communities since 1961, when CFFB was opened in Frobisher Bay, Northwest Territories (modern day Iqaluit, Nunavut).

The wood industry classifies the species as a southern yellow pine. U.S. Forest Service surveys found that loblolly pine is the second-most common species of tree in the United States, after red maple. For its timber, the pine species is regarded as the most commercially important tree in the Southeastern U.S. The common name loblolly is given because the pine species is found mostly in lowlands and swampy areas. Loblolly pine is the first among over 100 species of Pinus to have its complete genome sequenced. As of March 2014, it was the organism having the largest sequenced genome size. Its genome, with 22 billion base pairs, is seven times larger than that of humans. As of 2018, assembly of the axolotl genome (32Gb) displaced loblolly pine as the largest assembled genome.  Description  Developing male cones and needles Loblolly pine can reach a height of with a diameter of . Exceptional specimens may reach tall, the largest of the southern pines. Its needles are in bundles of three, sometimes twisted, and measure long, an intermediate length for southern pines, shorter than those of the longleaf pine or slash pine, but longer than those of the shortleaf pine and spruce pine. The needles usually last up to two years before they fall, which gives the species its evergreen character. Although some needles fall throughout the year due to severe weather, insect damage, and drought, most needles fall during the autumn and winter of their second year. The seed cones are green, ripening pale buff-brown, in length, broad when closed, opening to wide, each scale bearing a sharp spine long.Farjon, A. (2005). Pines: Drawings and Descriptions of the Genus Pinus, ed.2. Brill, Leiden . The tallest loblolly pine currently known, which is tall, and the largest, which measures in volume, are in Congaree National Park.  Taxonomy and naming  Mature unopened female cones The word \\"loblolly\\" is a combination of \\"lob\\", referring to thick, heavy bubbling of cooking porridge, and \\"lolly\\", an old British dialect word for broth, soup, or any other food boiled in a pot. In the southern United States, the word is used to mean \\"a mudhole; a mire,\\" a sense derived from an allusion to the consistency of porridge. Hence, the pine is named as it is generally found in lowlands and swampy areas. Loblolly pines grow well in acidic, clay soil, which is common throughout the South, thus are often found in large stands in rural places. Other old names, now rarely used, include oldfield pine, due to its status as an early colonizer of abandoned fields; bull pine, due to its size (several other yellow pines are also often so named, especially large isolated specimens); rosemary pine, due to loblolly's distinctive fragrance compared to the other southern pines; and North Carolina pine. For the scientific name, Pinus is the Latin name for the pines and taeda refers to the resinous wood. Bark on a mature tree  Ecology  With the advent of wildfire suppression, loblolly pine has become prevalent in some parts of the Deep South that were once dominated by longleaf pine and, especially in northern Florida, slash pine.Richardson, D. M., & Rundel, P. W. (1998). Ecology and biogeography of Pinus: an introduction. Pages 3‚Äì46 in Richardson, D. M., ed. Ecology and biogeography of Pinus. Cambridge University Press . The rate of growth is rapid, even among the generally fast-growing southern pines. The yellowish, resinous wood is prized for lumber, but is also used for wood pulp. This tree is commercially grown in extensive plantations. Loblolly pine is the pine of the Lost Pines Forest around Bastrop, Texas, and in McKinney Roughs along the Texas Colorado River. These are isolated populations on areas of acidic sandy soil, surrounded by alkaline clays that are poor for pine growth. A study using loblolly pines showed that higher atmospheric carbon dioxide levels may help the trees to endure ice storms better.Greenhouse Gas Good for Some Trees - LiveScience.com  Notable trees  The famous \\"Eisenhower Tree\\" on the 17th hole of Augusta National Golf Club was a loblolly pine. U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, an Augusta National member, hit the tree so many times that at a 1956 club meeting, he proposed that it be cut down. Not wanting to offend the President, the club's chairman, Clifford Roberts, immediately adjourned the meeting rather than reject the request outright. In February 2014, an ice storm severely damaged the Eisenhower Tree. The opinion of arborists was that the tree could not be saved and should be removed. The \\"Morris Pine\\" is located in southeastern Arkansas; it is over 300 years old with a diameter of and a height of . Loblolly pine seeds were carried aboard the Apollo 14 flight. On its return, the seeds were planted in several locations in the US, including the grounds of the White House. , a number of these moon trees remain alive. Genome Pines are the most common conifers and the genus Pinus consists of more than 100 species. Sequencing of their genomes remained a huge challenge because of the high complexity and size. Loblolly pine became the first species with its complete genome sequenced. This was the largest genome assembled until 2018, when the axolotl genome (32Gb) was assembled. The loblolly pine genome is made up of 22.18 billion base pairs, which is more than seven times that of humans. Conifer genomes are known to be full of repetitive DNA, which make up 82% of the genome in loblolly pine (compared to only 50% in humans). The number of genes is estimated at about 50,172, of which 15,653 are already confirmed. Most of the genes are duplicates. Some genes have the longest introns observed among fully sequenced plant genomes. Inbreeding depression Gymnosperms are predominantly outcrossing, but lack genetic self-incompatibility. Loblolly pine, like most gymnosperms, exhibits high levels of inbreeding depression, especially in the embryonic stage. The loblolly pine harbors an average load of at least eight lethal equivalents. A lethal equivalent is the number of deleterious genes per haploid genome whose cumulative effect is the equivalent of one lethal gene. The presence of at least eight lethal equivalents implies substantial inbreeding depression upon self-fertilization.

An aggressive left-handed batsman, Hookes usually batted in the middle order. His international career got off to a sensational start in the Centenary Test at Melbourne in 1977 when he hit England captain Tony Greig for five consecutive boundaries, but a combination of circumstances ensured that he never became a regular in the Australian team. He wrote in his autobiography, \\"I suspect history will judge me harshly as a batsman because of my modest record in 23 Tests and I can't complain about that\\".Cricinfo.com: David Hookes player profile. For many years, he was a leading figure in Australian domestic cricket, most notably in his role as captain of South Australia (SA). Wisden called him \\"a first-class destroyer of second-rate bowling\\". Angered by Victorian captain Graham Yallop's late declaration in a Sheffield Shield match at the Adelaide Oval in October 1982, Hookes, who normally batted at number 3 or 4, promoted himself to opening batsman and proceeded to score a century from 34 balls in just 43 minutes (including 18 fours and two sixes), at the time the fastest century scored in first-class cricket.David Hookes ‚Äì Fastest first class century He finished his career as the highest run-scorer in Sheffield Shield history. An outspoken man who had several brushes with the game's officials, Hookes retired at the end of the 1991‚Äì92 season and pursued his media career. He moved to Melbourne in 1995 and broadcast on Radio 3AW. His popularity among players and his reputation for strong leadership led to his appointment as coach of the Victorian team in 2002. The team enjoyed success under his tutelage, but he died after being punched by a hotel bouncer outside a pub where he had been drinking with Victorian players following their victory in a match earlier in the day. Cricket career Hookes played for the West Torrens Cricket Club and made his A-Grade debut at the age of just 15. When he came in to bat he faced Adelaide Cricket Club bowler and local Australian rules football and media personality Ken \\"KG\\" Cunningham. KG said later in a Channel 9 tribute to Hookes that after the first two balls went past the edge of the bat, he walked down the wicket and attempted to upset the youngster in his first game and \\"gave him a huge spray\\". Hookes then sent the next four balls to the fence and after the over walked up to Cunningham and said: \\"Listen old man, if you continue to bowl those wobbly little inswingers the next four will go over the fence and not into the fence.\\" In later years KG became one of Hookes's close friends and on Adelaide television and radio one of his strongest supporters even after his move to Melbourne to become coach of the Victorian state side. David Hookes made his first-class debut in 1975‚Äì76 for South Australia. A rush of form in February 1977, when he scored five centuries from six innings in 17 days, led to his selection for the Centenary Test in March, 1977, at the age of 21. Test debut and WSC During Australia's second innings of the match, Hookes made 56, and hit Tony Greig for five consecutive boundaries. Soon after, he signed a contract with World Series Cricket (WSC) and then toured England. Playing all five Tests, Hookes compiled 283 runs at 31.44, with scores of 85 at The Oval and 50 at Lord's. Hookes was one of the key personalities marketed by the breakaway WSC organisation. In a \\"Supertest\\" at the Sydney Showground in 1977, a bouncer from Andy Roberts broke his jaw, and his confidence never fully recovered from the injury. Nevertheless, he was the third-best performed Australian batsman behind Ian and Greg Chappell with 770 runs (at 38.5 average) in 12 \\"Supertests\\" played during the 1977‚Äì78 and 1978‚Äì79 seasons. His future in the Australian team following the rapprochement between WSC and official cricket seemed assured. Problems post-WSC However, Hookes managed just one Test and two ODIs when injury curtailed his 1979‚Äì80 season. Returned to fitness, he toured Pakistan in 1980, but made a pair in the first Test at Karachi, dismissed twice by spin bowler Iqbal Qasim. His play against slow bowling had not developed and he was vulnerable to the well-flighted delivery as his footwork was non-existent.Cricinfo ‚Äì How good was David Hookes? Dropped from the Australian team, his form failed to improve in the following Australian season, and he lost his place in the South Australia team as well. The SACA took a gamble by appointing Hookes as South Australia captain at the start of the 1981‚Äì82 season. He responded to the challenge and led the state to the Sheffield Shield. Improved confidence and form led to his reinstatement in the Australian team for the 1982‚Äì83 Ashes series, and he batted consistently for 344 runs at 49.14 average with a best score of 68 in the fourth Test at Melbourne. Continuing his good form on the following tour of Sri Lanka, Hookes scored 143 off 152 balls in the first Test between the nations. Last seasons Hookes's performances were more subdued during the 1983 World Cup in England. Australia played poorly in the tournament. When the team returned home, Hookes criticised the team's captain, Kim Hughes. This earned him a fine and he was dropped from the 1983‚Äì84 Test series against Pakistan. He returned for five Tests in the West Indies during the 1984 tour and passed 20 in seven of his ten innings, yet made only one half-century, 51 at Antigua in the fourth Test. Frustrated by Hookes's failure to turn regular starts into big scores, the Australian selectors ignored him for the next 18 months. He was not selected for the 1985 tour of England, although there had been an exodus of Australian players on a rebel tour of South Africa. His last international appearances were in 1985‚Äì86, when he played two Tests against both New Zealand and India, and two ODIs in the World Series Cup. Thereafter, Australia pursued a selection policy of giving prolonged opportunities to younger players and passing over older players with inconsistent records. Domestic performances Despite his failure to live up to expectations at the highest level, Hookes continued to captain South Australia until 1990, when he was sensationally sacked. In October 1982, Hookes thrashed a 43-minute, 34-ball century, which in some respects is the fastest hundred in first-class history.Cricinfo ‚Äì The 34-ball carnage On 7‚Äì8 March 1987, Hookes and Wayne Phillips shared an unbroken fourth wicket stand of 462 for South Australia against Tasmania, with Hookes making his highest ever score of 306 not out coming in just 385 minutes from only 314 balls faced (Phillips scored 213 not out). Hookes' innings also included 40 fours and 2 sixes. Hookes and Wicket-keeper Phillips, both left-handed batsmen, broke the previous first- class partnership record of 456 set by Victorian pair Bill Ponsford and Edgar Mayne in the 1923‚Äì24 season against Queensland at the MCG.1986/87 Hookes & Phillips Hookes also formed a devastating partnership with fellow South Australian left-hander Darren Lehmann, the pair often entertaining spectators at the Adelaide Oval in Shield matches with their attacking play. In all first-class cricket, Hookes scored 12,671 runs in 178 matches at an average of 43.99. Batting style Hookes was an aggressive strokeplayer against fast bowling, and was known to play the hook shot effectively.Cricinfo ‚Äì Playing hooky However he had problems playing spin. He was known as an \\"eye\\" player ‚Äì or one who relied more on his eye than on sound batting technique. After retirement After his retirement, he became involved in the media, making appearances on television and hosting a radio programme on Melbourne radio station 3AW with fellow sportscaster Gerard Healy. In 2002, he was selected as the new coach of the Victorian cricket team, a team he had grown up hating. He led a revival of the team, which had struggled in previous years. The team subsequently rose back to the top of the Australian domestic competition. During August 2003, Hookes was criticised after his comment in reference to Helen Cohen Alon, a South African woman who had claimed Australian cricketer Shane Warne had sexually harassed her via telephone. Commenting on her as \\"some dopey, hairy-backed sheila who has dobbed [Warne] in across the other side of the world. If that's what she wants to do to earn some cash that's her decision. Let's find out the facts before we hang Warney on this one\\".Cricinfo ‚Äì Hookes puts his foot in it ... Cricinfo ‚Äì 'A dopey, hairy-backed sheila' He accused the Australian selectors of bias towards players from New South Wales stating that \\"when they give out the baggy blue cap in New South Wales, they give you a baggy green one in a brown paper bag as well to save making two presentations.\\"David Hookes Wisden Obituary Personal life Hookes married his childhood sweetheart and first wife Roxanne, but left her for his second wife, Robyn Gellman. They were married for 22 years. Hookes had two stepchildren. Hookes and Robyn separated in late 2003 due to Hookes's infidelities.Australian Story ‚Äì In the Midnight Hour At the time of his death he had been in a two-year relationship with Christine Padfield, then marketing coordinator at Cricket Victoria, who was present when he died.Fairfax Digital ‚Äì Hinch defiant: I've done nothing wrong Death On the night of 18 January 2004, Hookes went to the Beaconsfield Hotel in West St Kilda, Melbourne, with members of the Victorian and South Australian cricket teams, including former Australian coach Darren Lehmann, to celebrate a win by the former over the latter in a one-day match. Christine Padfield was also with Hookes, as was a friend of Padfield's, Tania Plumpton. Soon after midnight, a brawl erupted between the party and hotel staff. There are conflicting stories about the reason. It seemed to have been generated by a \\"last drinks\\" call by hotel staff. It is also unclear whether the party left voluntarily or were forced to leave. The hotel's security staff continued following the party for a short distance outside the hotel. In the altercation that followed one of the bouncers, Zdravko Miƒáeviƒá, punched Hookes. He fell to the ground, hitting his head in the process, and went into cardiac arrest.SMH ‚Äì Lehmann says bouncers 'chased' Hookes He was revived by paramedics but did not regain consciousness.

Built by HMA Naval Dockyard in Victoria, Benalla was fitted out as armed survey ship instead of a minesweeper like the rest of the class, and was commissioned into the RAN in 1943. Benallas duties included convoy escort and performing hydrological surveys prior to amphibious landing operations. The corvette was present at the Japanese surrender of Timor at the end of the war. Post-war, Benalla performed survey work around north-west Australia until late 1945. She was decommissioned in 1946, and sold for scrapping in 1958. Design and construction In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose 'local defence vessel' capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate.Stevens, The Australian Corvettes, p. 1Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 103 The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì4 The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì5 Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 104 The need for locally built 'all-rounder' vessels at the start of World War II saw the \\"Australian Minesweepers\\" (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as \\"corvettes\\") approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including Benalla) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 105, 148Donohue, From Empire Defence to the Long Haul, p. 29Stevens et al., The Royal Australian Navy, p. 108 Despite being part of a class of minesweepers, Benalla was fitted out as an armed survey ship. Minesweeping gear was not installed, and an extension to X deck housed a large chart room. Her role resulted in an increase from the standard ship's company of 85 to 107. Benalla was laid down at HMA Naval Dockyard in Williamstown, Victoria on 24 March 1942. She was launched on 19 December 1942 by the wife of Arthur Drakeford, serving Minister for the Air, and commissioned on 28 April 1943. Operational history Benalla entered service on 2 June 1943, towing an ammunition lighter from Sydney to Brisbane. She worked her way up the eastern Australia coast to New Guinea, escorting a small convoy between Townsville and Milne Bay, where she would be based as a survey vessel for the rest of 1943. Arriving in New Guinea waters in late June, the corvette was immediately assigned to support the landing of United States troops on Kiriwina Island and Woodlark Island on 30 June during Operation Chronicle; these landings were unopposed as there were no Japanese soldiers on the islands. From July to September, Benalla and sister ship led a Survey Group of vessels to perform hydrological surveys of the waters around Lae, Salamaua, and Finschhafen, in preparation of Australian troop landings at these locations. Benalla remained at Milne Bay until early December, when she proceeded to Sydney for refit. HMAS Sleuth (left) off Darwin in 1944. Returning to survey work New Guinea in February 1944, the corvette was involved in the surveying of Seeadler Harbor and the waters around the Admiralty Islands following their capture by the United States as part of Operation Brewer in March and April. In August, she sailed for Brisbane to undergo a two-month refit. On 11 October, Benalla sailed for the Philippines via Hollandia, joining the escort of 20 Liberty ships on the second leg. In November, the corvette assisted frigate in surveying San Pedro Bay, before resuming work in the New Guinea area. On 6 January 1945, Benalla was sent to Darwin and assigned to a Survey Group operating off the north-western coast of Australia. She spent four months with the group, then was assigned to Fremantle from 3 May to 20 July. Returning to Darwin, Benalla was assigned to a joint Australian-Dutch group heading for Koepang, and was present when the Japanese surrender of Timor was carried out aboard on 11 September 1945. The corvette was later awarded the battle honour \\"New Guinea 1943‚Äì44\\" in recognition of her wartime service. Benalla resumed survey work off the north- west coast of Australia on her return from Timor, a role she would maintain until 2 November 1945, when she was ordered to Fremantle for decommissioning. The corvette was decommissioned into reserve on 28 January 1946. She was transferred from Fremantle to Melbourne, Geelong, then Sydney over the course of 1955 and 1956, and was sold to Mitsubishi Shoji Kaisha Ltd of Tokyo on 20 February 1958, who towed the vessel to Japan in April for scrapping.

Before European settlers came to what is now Canada, the region was occupied by many First Nations, including the West Coast Salish and Haida, the centrally located Iroquois, Blackfoot and Huron, the Dene to the North, and the Innu and Mi'kmaq in the East and the Cree in the North. Each of the indigenous communities had (and have) their own unique musical traditions. Chanting ‚Äì singing is widely popular and most use a variety of musical instruments.  History  Traditionally, Indigenous Canadians used the materials at hand to make their instruments for centuries before Europeans immigrated to Canada. First Nation bands made gourds and animal horns into rattles, many rattles were elaborately carved and beautifully painted.Indian & Northern Affairs Canada ‚Äì Canadian Government information PDF on First Nation music In woodland areas, they made horns of birchbark and drumsticks of carved antlers and wood. Drums were generally made of carved wood and animal hides. Drums and rattles are percussion instruments traditionally used by First Nations people.Veterans Affairs Canada ‚Äì Canadian Government section on First Nation music and dance These musical instruments provide the background for songs, and songs are the background for dances. Many traditional First Nations people consider song and dance to be sacred. For many years after Europeans came to Canada, First Nations people were forbidden to practice their ceremonies. That is one reason why little information about First Nations music and musical instruments is available. Traditionally Inuktitut did not have a word for what a European-influenced listener or ethnomusicologist's understanding of music, \\"and ethnographic investigation seems to suggest that the concept of music as such is also absent from their culture.\\" The closest word, nipi, includes music, the sound of speech, and noise. (Nattiez 1990:56) Today, a revival of pride in First Nations art and music is taking and beauty of traditional First Nations art, music and musical instruments. Drums are closely associated with First Nations people. Some people say, \\"Drumming is the heartbeat of Mother Earth.\\" First Nations made a great variety of drums. Healers sometimes use miniature drums. There are also tambourine-shaped hand drums, war drums, water drums, and very large ceremonial drums. Their size and shape depends on the First Nation's particular culture and what the drummer wants to do with them. Many are beautifully decorated. In many First Nations cultures, the circle is important. It is the shape of the sun and moon, and of the path they trace across the sky. Many First Nations objects, such as tipis and wigwams, are circular in shape. Traditional villages were place. First Nations people are recovering the knowledge, history often arranged with the dwellings placed in a circle. To this day, many First Nations people hold meetings sitting in a circle. Meetings often begin with a prayer, with the people standing in a circle holding hands. Atikamekw musician Sakay Ottawa Hand carved wooden flutes and whistles are less common than drums, but are also a part of First Nations traditional music. Chippewa men played flutes to serenade girlfriends and to soothe themselves and others during hard times. The Cree, Iroquois and Maliseet made and used whistles. Archaeologists have found evidence that both wooden whistles and flutes were used by the Beothuk, an extinct tribe who lived in Newfoundland until the early days of European settlement. The human voice is the primary instrument of all First Nations. As it is in most ancient music, singing is the heart of First Nations traditions. Every song had an original owner. Songs belonged to a society, clan, rite, ceremony or individual. In some cultures, one could buy the right to sing a song owned by an individual. The original owner would then teach the buyer to sing the song. Many traditional songs are still sung by First Nations people who follow traditional ways. Many artists also now combine First Nations and Inuit music with mainstream popular music genres such as country, rock, hip hop or electronic dance music.\\"Inuit pop, Algonquin rap, Innu reggae aim for mainstream\\".

The compilation album Native North America, Vol. 1, released by Light in the Attic Records in 2014, collects many rare and out-of-print songs by First Nations and Inuit musicians from the era in which the rock and country and folk genres were beginning to emerge as influences on Indigenous music.\\"Light in the Attic Unearths the Forgotten History of First Nations Music with 'Native North America' Compilation\\". Exclaim!, 8 October 2014.  Music areas =Northeast Woodlands Inhabiting a wide swath of the United States and Canada, Eastern Woodlands natives, according to Nettl, can be distinguished by antiphony (call and response style singing), which does not occur in other areas. Their territory includes Maritime Canada, New England, U.S. Mid-Atlantic, Great Lakes and Southeast regions. Songs are rhythmically complex, characterized by frequent metric changes and a close relationship to ritual dance. Flutes and whistles are solo instruments, and a wide variety of drums, rattles and striking sticks are played. Nettl describes the Eastern music area as the region between the Mississippi river and the Atlantic. The most complex styles being that of the Southeastern Creek, Yuchi, Cherokee, Choctaw, Iroquois and their language group, the simpler style being that of the Algonquian language group including Delaware and Penobscot. The Algonquian speaking Shawnee have a relatively complex style influenced by the nearby southeastern tribes. The characteristics of this entire area include short iterative phrases, reverting relationships, shouts before, during, and after singing, anhematonic pentatonic scales, simple rhythms and metre and, according to Nettl, antiphonal or responsorial techniques including \\"rudimentary imitative polyphony\\". Melodic movement tends to be gradually descending throughout the area and vocals include a moderate amount of tension and pulsation. Plains Extending across the American Midwest into Canadian Prairies, Plains-area music is nasal, with high pitches and frequent falsettos, with a terraced descent (a step-by-step descent down an octave) in an unblended monophony. Strophes use incomplete repetition, meaning that songs are divided into two parts, the second of which is always repeated before returning to the beginning. Large double-sided skin drums are characteristic of the Plains tribes, and solo end-blown flutes (flageolet) are also common. Nettl describes the central Plains tribes, from Canada to Texas: Blackfoot, Crow, Dakota, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Kiowa, and Comanche, as the most typical and simple sub- area of the Plains-Pueblo music area. This area's music is characterized by extreme vocal tension, pulsation, melodic preference for perfect fourths and a range averring a tenth, rhythmic complexity, and increased frequence of tetratonic scales. The musics of the Arapaho and Cheyenne intensify these characteristics, while the northern tribes, especially Blackfoot music, feature simpler material, smaller melodic ranges, and fewer scale tones. Nettl Arapaho music includes ceremonial and secular songs, such as the ritualistic Sun Dance, performed in the summer when the various bands of the Arapaho people would come together. Arapaho traditional songs consist of two sections exhibiting terraced descent, with a range greater than an octave and scales between four and six tones. Other ceremonial songs were received in visions, or taught as part of the men's initiations into a society for his age group. Secular songs include a number of social dances, such as the triple metre round dances and songs to inspire warriors or recent exploits. There are also songs said to be taught by a guardian spirit, which should only be sung when the recipient is near death. Northwest Coast Open vocals with monophony are common in the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia, though polyphony also occurs (this the only area of North America with native polyphony). Chromatic intervals accompanying long melodies are also characteristic, and rhythms are complex and declamatory, deriving from speech. Instrumentation is more diverse than in the rest of North America, and includes a wide variety of whistles, flutes, horns and percussion instruments. Nettl describes the music of the Kwakwaka'wakw, Nuu-chah-nulth, Tsimshian, Makah, and Quileute as some of the most complex on the continent, with the music of the Salish nations (Nlaka'pamux, Nux√°lk, and Sliammon, and others directly east of the Northwest tribes) as being intermediary between these Northwest Coast tribes and Inuit music. The music of the Salish tribes, and even more so the Northwest coast, intensifies the significant features of Inuit music, their melodic movement is often pendulum-type (\\"leaping in broad intervals from one limit of the range to the other\\"). The Northwest coast music also \\"is among the most complicated on the continent, especially in regard to rhythmic structure,\\" featuring intricate rhythmic patterns distinct from but related to the vocal melody and rigid percussion. He also reports unrecorded use of incipient polyphony in the form of drones or parallel intervals in addition to antiphonal and responorial forms. Vocals are extremely tense, producing dynamic contrast, ornamentation, and pulsation, and also often using multiple sudden accents in one held tone. Arctic ‚Äì Sub-Arctic Nettl describes Inuit music as recitative-like singing, complex rhythmic organization, relatively small melodic range averaging about a sixth, prominence of major thirds and minor seconds melodically, with undulating melodic movement. =Inuit= The Inuit are well known for Inuit throat singing or katajjaq, an unusual method of vocalizing found only in a few cultures worldwide. Narrow-ranged melodies and declamatory effects are common, as in the Northwest. Repeated notes mark the ends of phrases. Box drums, which are found elsewhere, are common, as a tambourine-like hand drum. =Cree= Much Cree song takes the form of repeated sections delineated by rests and melodic or rhythmic patterns, though not all repetitions are exact.  Contributions of First Nations music to Canadian culture =Edward Gamblin Edward Gamblin was a country rock singer-songwriter, who is widely credited as one of the most influential artists in the history and development of First Nations music as a genre, as one of the first artists ever to build a successful career by focusing primarily on First Nations audiences rather than pursuing crossover appeal.\\"A pioneer of aboriginal music, he gave voice to his fellow residential school survivors\\" . The Globe and Mail, 25 August 2010. Donald Harvey Francks Donald Harvey Francks or Iron Buffalo born in Vancouver, British Columbia. He is a drummer, poet, native nations champion, motorcyclist, author and peace activist. He is interested in Tibet and supports Greenpeace. He appeared many times at George's Spaghetti House, a Toronto jazz club that was the equivalent of New York's Birdland. He was also known to sit in on drums at the Colonial Tavern and other Toronto afterhours clubs and jazz venues. \\"A Conversation with Don Francks.\\" Robbie Robertson Robbie Robertson is a Canadian singer-songwriter, and guitarist. He is best known for his membership in The Band. He was ranked 78th in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time. Robertson was born to a Jewish father and a Mohawk mother and took his stepfather's last name after his mother remarried. He had his earliest exposure to music at Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation, where he spent summers with his mother's family. He studied guitar when he was a youth and has been writing songs and performing since a teenager. From 1987 onwards, Robertson released a series of four solo albums, his first was self titled followed by Storyville, Music for the Native Americans, and Contact from the Underworld of Redboy.  Jerry Alfred  First Nations singer and storyteller Jerry Alfred helps to preserve First Nations language and traditions. Jerry is the Northern Tutchone (too-SHOWnee) \\"Keeper of the Songs.\\" He lives in Pelly Crossing, a village in central Yukon, 300 kilometres north of Whitehorse. He was born in the nearby community of Mayo. Jerry managed to keep his Tutchone language despite many years spent in a residential school. Like his father before him, Jerry was named a Song Keeper at birth. A Song Keeper collects songs and sings them at potlatches and other First Nations ceremonial occasions. A self-taught guitarist, Jerry combines modern guitar techniques and the traditional music of his people. His 1994 recording, \\"Etsi Shon\\" (EET-seeshown) or \\"Grandfather Song\\" helps to keep his language and the spirit of his people alive.  Don Ross  Don Ross, guitarist and composer, is the son of a Mi'kmaq mother and a Scottish immigrant father. He is a band member of the Mi'kmaq community at Millbrook, Nova Scotia. Don was born and raised in Montreal and speaks both French and English. He earned an honors degree in fine arts (music) at York University in Toronto. He is one of the most respected musicians in Canada and is known as one of the top guitarists in the world. In September 1996, Don won the prestigious U.S. National Finger style Championship for the second time and is the only guitarist to have done so. In 1988, Don was the first Canadian, and first Indigenous person, to win this prize. Don is a master of \\"fingerstyle\\" technique, which is like the technique used for classical guitar. His music is strongly influenced by jazz, folk, rock, and classical music, creating a personal style. Don calls his style \\"heavy wood!\\"  Buffy Sainte-Marie  Buffy Sainte-Marie was born into the Cree community of Fort Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan. She received a PhD in Fine Arts from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. She is a songwriter, performer and artist who has written huge hit songs that were performed by other famous artists including Elvis Presley, Barbra Streisand, and Neil Diamond. Her song, \\"Up Where We Belong\\" won an Academy Award. Buffy has earned many other awards, including an Academy Award and the United States award for Lifetime Musical Achievement in the Arts. She has also received a medal of recognition from Queen Elizabeth II. France named her \\"Best International Artist of 1993.\\" Buffy continues to draw large crowds to her performances, with an audience of 100,000 in one Denmark concert. But she has never forgotten her beginnings and her people, and she regularly performs in the smallest First Nations communities. Nor does she forget other musicians. In 1993, she helped to create a special award category within the Juno Awards competition to recognize the best recordings of Canadian Indigenous musicians. Buffy received a Lifetime Achievement Award in Arts at the 1998 National Aboriginal Achievement Awards.  Kashtin  The duo quickly became popular regionally in Quebec, and in 1988 they were featured in a documentary on the Innu for a Quebec television station. They were soon brought to Montreal to record, and released their self-titled debut album in 1989. Although that album was recorded in their native Innu-aimun language, spoken by just 12,000 people in the world, the album quickly became a major hit in Quebec, and soon in English Canada as well, eventually being certified double platinum. The singles \\"E Uassiuian\\" and \\"Tshinanu\\" were popular hits for the band.\\"Kashtin ‚Äì Innu Dawn Rising\\" by Alastair Sutherland, Music Express Vol. 145 1990, 44 Leela Gilday Leela Gilday is a singer and songwriter, born and raised in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories.

He was Chair of the Departments of Botany and Geology at Indiana University and later at Stanford University. He was a member of the founding faculty at Stanford and served as the university's second president. He served as President of the Geological Society of America in 1904.Fairchild, Herman LeRoy, 1932, The Geological Society of America 1888-1930, a Chapter in Earth Science History: New York, The Geological Society of America, 232 p.Eckel, Edwin, 1982, GSA Memoir 155, The Geological Society of America ‚Äî Life History of a Learned Society: Boulder, Colorado, Geological Society of America Memoir 155, 168 p., . He was President of the Seismological Society of America in 1911. He was an expert in Brazilian geology, among many other things. Biography Branner Hall, a student residence on the Stanford University campus. Branner was born in the town of New Market, Tennessee, where his father was a merchant. In 1852, the family went to live on a farm given to his father by his grandfather a mile east of Dandridge on the French Broad River. He grew up there and on an adjacent property to which the family moved in 1859. During the Civil War he was very anxious to join the Confederate army, and on two occasions left school for the purpose of enlisting. His age, however, prevented his being accepted; he was only thirteen. In 1865, he went to school for a year at New Market and in 1867, he spent a year at Maryville College. He left that institution in 1868, and in 1869, went to Ithaca, New York, to attend Cornell University. He spent a year attending Ithaca Academy and entered Cornell in 1870, in the so-called classical course. In 1874, without having completed his university studies, he went by way of Europe to Brazil with Charles Fred Hartt, then professor of geology at Cornell. In 1875, he was made assistant on the geological survey of Brazil and remained on that work until the survey was abolished by the government and Professor Hartt died. In 1879, he accepted a position as assistant engineer and interpreter for the S√£o Cyriaco Gold Mining Company of Boston, and spent a year near Serro, state of Minas Geraes, in the diamond regions of Brazil. In 1881, he returned to the United States, but was sent back to South America by Thomas Edison in search of a vegetable fiber for use in his then newly invented incandescent electric lamp. In 1882, he returned to Cornell University, completed his studies and graduated. In 1883 to 1885, he was topographic geologist of the Geological Survey of Pennsylvania in the anthracite regions; in 1885, after receiving his Ph.D. from Indiana University, he was made professor of geology at Indiana University, a position he held until 1891, though he was absent on leave for several years. In 1887, he was appointed State Geologist of the Geological Survey of Arkansas. As State Geologist, he exposed gold-mining swindles then operating in Arkansas, for which the citizens of Bear City, Arkansas, burned him in effigy, and the stock promoters tried to have him fired.Dan Plazak (2006) A Hole in the Ground with a Liar at the Top, Salt Lake: University of Utah Press, pp. 122-123. In 1891, he was appointed Professor and Chair of the Department of Geology at the newly opened Stanford University, recruited by his colleague from Cornell and Indiana, Stanford President David Starr Jordan. When Jordan retired as president of Stanford in 1913, Branner was elected President of the university. He retired January 1, 1916, due to an age limit established by the university and was named President Emeritus. While at Stanford he directed the Agassiz-Branner expedition to Brazil in 1899 and a second similar expedition in 1907-1908. He served on government commissions studying the Panama Canal and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. He published a grammar of the Portuguese language, based on his work in Brazil, which went to multiple editions. In 1913, he greatly contributed to genealogical research of the Shenandoah Valley by privately publishing Casper Branner of Virginia and his Descendants,John Casper Branner (1913) Casper Branner of Virginia and His Descendants, Privately Printed, Stanford University. a 453-page work documenting the genealogy of the Branner family and in particular the descendants of his great great grandparents, Casper Branner (1729‚Äì1792) and wife Catherine (1730‚Äì1800). Legacy A dormitory building and the Branner Earth Sciences Library at Stanford are named after him. Two of his Stanford students, United States President Herbert Hoover and his wife Lou Henry Hoover, dedicated their English translation of the medieval mining classic De re metallica to Branner. An extinct species of crab found in California, Cancer branneri, was named after him in 1926.

In phraseology, collocation is a sub-type of phraseme. An example of a phraseological collocation, as propounded by Michael Halliday,Halliday, M.A.K., 'Lexis as a Linguistic Level', Journal of Linguistics 2(1) 1966: 57-67 is the expression strong tea. While the same meaning could be conveyed by the roughly equivalent powerful tea, this expression is considered excessive and awkward by English speakers. Conversely, a corresponding expression in technology, powerful computer, is preferred over strong computer. Phraseological collocations should not be confused with idioms, where an idiom's meaning is derived from its convention as a stand-in for something else while collocation is a mere popular composition. There are about six main types of collocations: adjective+noun, noun+noun (such as collective nouns), verb+noun, adverb+adjective, verbs+prepositional phrase (phrasal verbs), and verb+adverb. Collocation extraction is a computational technique that finds collocations in a document or corpus, using various computational linguistics elements resembling data mining. Expanded definition Collocations are partly or fully fixed expressions that become established through repeated context-dependent use. Such terms as 'crystal clear', 'middle management', 'nuclear family', and 'cosmetic surgery' are examples of collocated pairs of words. Collocations can be in a syntactic relation (such as verb‚Äìobject: 'make' and 'decision'), lexical relation (such as antonymy), or they can be in no linguistically defined relation. Knowledge of collocations is vital for the competent use of a language: a grammatically correct sentence will stand out as awkward if collocational preferences are violated. This makes collocation an interesting area for language teaching. Corpus linguists specify a key word in context (KWIC) and identify the words immediately surrounding them. This gives an idea of the way words are used. The processing of collocations involves a number of parameters, the most important of which is the measure of association, which evaluates whether the co-occurrence is purely by chance or statistically significant. Due to the non-random nature of language, most collocations are classed as significant, and the association scores are simply used to rank the results. Commonly used measures of association include mutual information, t scores, and log-likelihood.Dunning, Ted (1993): \\"Accurate methods for the statistics of surprise and coincidence\\". Computational Linguistics 19, 1 (Mar. 1993), 61-74. Rather than select a single definition, GledhillGledhill C. (2000): Collocations in Science Writing, Narr, T√ºbingen proposes that collocation involves at least three different perspectives: (i) co-occurrence, a statistical view, which sees collocation as the recurrent appearance in a text of a node and its collocates,Firth J.R. (1957): Papers in Linguistics 1934‚Äì1951. Oxford: Oxford University Press.Sinclair J. (1996): \\"The Search for Units of Meaning\\", in Textus, IX, 75‚Äì106. Smadja F. A & McKeown, K. R. (1990): \\"Automatically extracting and representing collocations for language generation\\", Proceedings of ACL'90, 252‚Äì259, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. (ii) construction, which sees collocation either as a correlation between a lexeme and a lexical-grammatical pattern,Hunston S. & Francis G. (2000): Pattern Grammar ‚Äî A Corpus-Driven Approach to the Lexical Grammar of English, Amsterdam, John Benjamins or as a relation between a base and its collocative partnersHausmann F. J. (1989): Le dictionnaire de collocations. In Hausmann F.J., Reichmann O., Wiegand H.E., Zgusta L.(eds), W√∂rterb√ºcher : ein internationales Handbuch zur Lexikographie. Dictionaries. Dictionnaires. Berlin/New-York : De Gruyter. 1010-1019. and (iii) expression, a pragmatic view of collocation as a conventional unit of expression, regardless of form. Moon R. (1998): Fixed Expressions and Idioms, a Corpus-Based Approach. Oxford, Oxford University Press.Frath P. & Gledhill C. (2005): \\"Free-Range Clusters or Frozen Chunks? Reference as a Defining Criterion for Linguistic Units,\\" in Recherches anglaises et Nord-am√©ricaines, vol. 38 :25‚Äì43 These different perspectives contrast with the usual way of presenting collocation in phraseological studies. Traditionally speaking, collocation is explained in terms of all three perspectives at once, in a continuum: :'Free Combination' ‚Üî 'Bound Collocation' ‚Üî 'Frozen Idiom' In dictionaries In 1933, Harold Palmer's Second Interim Report on English Collocations highlighted the importance of collocation as a key to producing natural-sounding language, for anyone learning a foreign language.Cowie, A.P., English Dictionaries for Foreign Learners, Oxford University Press 1999:54-56 Thus from the 1940s onwards, information about recurrent word combinations became a standard feature of monolingual learner's dictionaries. As these dictionaries became 'less word-centred and more phrase-centred',Bejoint, H., The Lexicography of English, Oxford University Press 2010: 318 more attention was paid to collocation. This trend was supported, from the beginning of the 21st century, by the availability of large text corpora and intelligent corpus-querying software, making possible to provide a more systematic account of collocation in dictionaries. Using these tools, dictionaries such as the Macmillan English Dictionary and the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English included boxes or panels with lists of frequent collocations. There are also a number of specialized dictionaries devoted to describing the frequent collocations in a language.Herbst, T. and Klotz, M. 'Syntagmatic and Phraseological Dictionaries' in Cowie, A.P. (Ed.) The Oxford History of English Lexicography, 2009: part 2, 234-243 These include (for Spanish) Redes: Diccionario combinatorio del espa√±ol contemporaneo (2004), (for French) Le Robert: Dictionnaire des combinaisons de mots (2007), and (for English) the LTP Dictionary of Selected Collocations (1997) and the Macmillan Collocations Dictionary (2010).  Statistically significant collocation  Student's t-test can be used to determine whether the occurrence of a collocation in a corpus is statistically significant. For a bigram w_1w_2, let P(w_1) = \\\\frac{#w_1}{N} be the unconditional probability of occurrence of w_1 in a corpus with size N, and let P(w_2) = \\\\frac{#w_2}{N} be the unconditional probability of occurrence of w_2 in the corpus. Then the t-score for the bigram w_1w_2 is calculated as: t = \\\\frac{\\\\bar{x} - \\\\mu}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{s^2}{N}}}, where \\\\bar{x} = \\\\frac{# w_iw_j}{N} is the sample mean of the occurrence of w_1w_2, #w_1w_2 is the number of occurrences of w_1w_2, \\\\mu = P(w_i)P(w_j) is the probability of w_1w_2 under the null-hypothesis that w_1 and w_2 appear independently in the text, and s^2 = \\\\bar{x}(1-\\\\bar{x}) \\\\approx \\\\bar{x} is the sample variance. With a large N, the t-test is equivalent to a z-test.

He was also previously a member of the bands Gillan and White Spirit. Career Gers began his career as the lead guitarist of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal band White Spirit, before joining Gillan, a group formed by then-former Deep Purple vocalist Ian Gillan. After Gillan disbanded, Gers undertook a Humanities degree before joining Gogmagog, which included former Iron Maiden vocalist Paul Di'Anno and drummer Clive Burr. The project came to nothing; however, Gers went on to play guitar for former Marillion vocalist Fish on his first solo album, Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors, and was asked to record a song called \\"Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter\\" with Iron Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson for a soundtrack. The project expanded into an album, Tattooed Millionaire, and during its recording Gers was asked to join Iron Maiden in place of Adrian Smith. He has remained with the band ever since, even after Smith rejoined the band in 1999, contributing to a total of nine studio albums. Influences, musical style, and performance style Gers' main influences are Ritchie Blackmore, Jeff Beck and Rory Gallagher. He is noted for his energetic stage presence, which often involves dancing, prancing, and performing tricks with his guitar, such as throwing it into the air and catching it. However, his on- stage flamboyancy has drawn criticism from some. He is also left-handed although he plays guitar right-handed; he can be seen signing autographs with his left hand in the Rock in Rio DVD. Personal life He has two children with his wife Sandra, Sian and Dylan Gers, and lives in Yarm, Teesside. His father, Boles≈Çaw,Tees Valley Birth Marriage & Death indexes. was an able seaman of the Polish Navy and served on ORP Burza and ORP Blyskawica on which he came to England and later joined the Royal Navy. Gers has relatives in the Bydgoszcz area and Sosno village in Poland and visited them regularly as a teenager until 1977. Gers bought his first guitar during one of those visits, in a music store in Zlot√≥w close to Pila Gers met his Polish family again after 34 years at a 2011 concert in Warsaw Gers is a fan of Hartlepool United and used to stand in the Mill House Terrace at Victoria Park on match days. Gers is a graduate of the English Martyrs School and Sixth Form College. Gers had an uncredited part in the BBC drama The Paradise Club in 1990, appearing as the lead guitarist of a band called Fraud Squad. He appeared in the 2010 fan-made Iron Maiden documentary Maiden Heaven. Musical equipment Gers is a long-time proponent of the Fender Stratocaster. His guitars are typically black or white with rosewood fingerboards and Seymour Duncan JB Jr. and Hot Rails pick-ups. His favourite guitar over the years has been a black Stratocaster, equipped with JB Jr. pick-ups, which was given to him by Ian Gillan. Gers uses four different Fender Stratocasters, as well as a Gibson Chet Atkins semi-acoustic model for songs such as \\"Dance of Death\\". Gers is currently endorsed by Sandberg Guitars, and he uses a California ST-S tobacco hc-aged and a California ST-S creme hc-aged model on stage. Like his bandmates, Dave Murray and Adrian Smith, Gers currently uses the Marshall JMP-1 preamp through a Marshall 9200 power amp. Preferring not to use foot- switches while playing, Gers' roadie operates his MIDI Foot Controller offstage. Favouring cables, Gers only uses a Shure UR4D wireless system when he throws his guitar around. He uses Ernie Ball Regular Slinky nickel-wound guitar strings, although he does not use the B string.

Set in London, it is the story of a struggling young writer, Jake Donaghue. Murdoch's first novel, its mixture of the philosophical and the picaresque has made it one of Murdoch's most popular novels. It is dedicated to Raymond Queneau. When Jake leaves Madge's flat in Chapter 1, two of the books he mentions taking are Murphy by Samuel Beckett, and Pierrot mon ami by Queneau, both of which are echoed in this story. The epigraph, from John Dryden's Secular Masque, refers to the way in which the main character is driven from place to place by his misunderstandings. In 2005, the novel was chosen by TIME magazine as one of the one hundred best English-language novels from 1923 to present.The Complete List  TIME Magazine ‚Äì ALL-TIME 100 Novels The editors of Modern Library named the work as one of the greatest English-language novels of the twentieth century.The Modern Library  100 Best  Novels Explanation of the title The \\"net\\" in question is the net of abstraction, generalization, and theory.Dennis Wrong (2005) The Persistence of the Particular, chapter 1: The irreducible particularities of human experience, Transaction Publishers In Chapter 6, a quotation from Jake's book The Silencer includes the passage: \\"All theorizing is flight. We must be ruled by the situation itself and this is unutterably particular. Indeed it is something to which we can never get close enough, however hard we may try as it were to crawl under the net.\\" Michael Wood, writing in the London Review of Books, claims \\"the work‚Äôs title,... borrows and interrogates an image [of Newtonian mechanics] from Wittgenstein‚Äôs Tractatus.\\" Peter J. Conradi, in his 2001 biography of Iris Murdoch, also asserts that \\"the title alludes to Wittgenstein‚Äôs Tractatus, 6, 341, the net of discourse behind which the world's particulars hide, which can separate us from our world, yet simultaneously connect us.\\" (Conradi also claims that the novel's character Hugo Belfounder is \\"a portrait of Wittgenstein's star pupil from 1937, Yorick Smythies.\\") Plot summary In this lightly comic novel about work, love, wealth and fame the main character of Jake Donaghue, a long-winded freeloader, seeks to improve his circumstances and make up for past mistakes by reconnecting with his old acquaintance Hugo Bellfounder, a mild mannered and soft spoken philosopher. Jake, a shameless mooch and hack-writer - now homeless and out of options - tracks down his ex- girlfriend, Anna Quentin, and her elegant sister, an actress named Sadie. He also reacquaints himself with Hugo, whose philosophy Jake had long ago presumptuously tried to decipher and interpret to his own liking. The plot develops through a series of adventures involving Jake and his offbeat minion, Finn. From the kidnapping of a movie-star canine to the staging of a political riot on a film set, Jake attempts to discover and incorporate Hugo‚Äôs abstruse philosophies. Berated yet enlightened, Jake's aspirations to become a true writer/philosopher may at last be at hand. Chapters 1‚Äì5: Thrown out Jake Donaghue has just arrived back in London from a trip to France. Finn, a distant relative who is so obliging that he is sometimes mistaken for a servant, tells Jake that they are being thrown out of Madge's house, where they have been living rent-free for eighteen months. A conversation with Madge reveals that they are being moved to make way for her new lover, the rich bookmaker Sammy Starfield. He goes with his suitcase to the cat-filled corner shop of Mrs Tinckham to check he has all his manuscripts and figure out where to live. Only one manuscript is missing: his translation of Le Rossignol de Bois, a novel by Jean-Pierre Breteuil. It is a mediocre work which he has done for money. He thinks of an old friend, a philosopher named Dave Gellman, and goes to his flat. A political meeting is being held there, and Dave is dismissive, but allows him to leave his suitcase. Finn suggests that he ask Anna Quentin, a singer he once fell in love with. Jake has not seen Anna for several years. He eventually tracks her down to the Riverside Miming Theatre, on Hammersmith Mall, and finds her in a prop room \\"like a vast toy shop\\". She is happy to see him, but somewhat uncomfortable when he asks about her new project, involving mime. She suggests that he ask her film-star sister, Sadie, for help. After she leaves he spends the night sleeping in the prop room. The next morning Jake goes to Welbeck Street to look for Sadie, and learns that she is at her Mayfair hairdresser. He spruces himself up, and goes to talk to her. She is very happy to see him there, and asks him to look after her flat while she hides from an admirer named Hugo Belfounder, a fireworks manufacturer who now owns a film studio. It so happens that Hugo was a former friend of Jake's. They had met long ago as fellow participants in a cold-cure experiment, and had had long philosophical discussions which Jake, without Hugo's knowledge, had turned into a book called The Silencer. Because Hugo believed that language was corrupt, Jake felt that creation of the book was a kind of betrayal, and had unilaterally broken off the friendship after its publication, not wishing to face Hugo's anger. Jake goes back to Madge's to fetch his radio, and finds Sammy there. Jake is prepared to fight, but the bookmaker is friendly and even offers him money to leave. This leads to a bet being placed by phone; they win ¬£633 10s, and Sammy promises to send him a cheque. Chapters 6‚Äì10: Anna and Hugo Jake goes to Sadie's flat to begin housesitting, and is surprised to see a copy of The Silencer on a bookshelf‚Äîdid Hugo give it to her? His pleasure in the flat's luxury is soon destroyed: firstly by a call from Hugo, asking for Miss Quentin (he hangs up when he hears Jake), and secondly by the discovery that he has been deliberately locked in. He calls from the window to his friends, Dave and Finn, who pick the lock and rescue him. Jake resolves to find Hugo, who must love Anna, and have given her the idea for the mime theatre. The three men take a taxi to Holborn Viaduct. They find Hugo's door open, and a note left saying \\"Gone to the pub\\". This begins a pub crawl; they do not find Hugo, but get very drunk. At the Skinners' Arms, they are joined by Lefty Todd, a political activist. After Lefty subjects Jake to a kind of Socialist catechism, they go for a walk, and all but Dave have a swim in the Thames. The next morning, Dave belatedly hands Jake a letter from Anna; she wants to see him as soon as possible. He rushes to the Riverside Theatre, but everything has been packed up, and she is gone. Devastated, he takes a ride in the lorry carrying away the contents of the prop room. Jake goes back to Sadie's flat to purloin her copy of The Silencer, but on approaching her door he overhears a conversation between her and Sammy about his most recent translation. His prolonged eavesdropping attracts the puzzled attention of neighbours, but he manages to deduce that Sadie and Sammy are planning to use his translation of Le Rossignol de Bois as the basis of a film proposal, and that they are not planning to recompense him for its use. He is furious. Chapters 11‚Äì13: Mister Mars With the help of Finn, Jake breaks into Sammy's flat in Chelsea to take the typescript, but they cannot find it; instead, on the spur of the moment, Jake decides to kidnap Sammy's filmstar dog, an Alsatian named Mr Mars, for the purposes of blackmail. They cannot open the dog's cage, and so with great difficulty they carry the whole cage away and file through the bars to get the dog out. A brief newspaper article reveals to Jake that Anna is travelling to Hollywood, via Paris. Accompanied by Mr Mars, Jake's search for Hugo takes him to Bounty Belfounder Studio, in South London. A huge crowd has gathered on a film set of Ancient Rome; they are listening to a political speech delivered by Lefty Todd. It is the first time in years that Jake has seen Hugo, and he drags him away to talk to him, but the sudden arrival of the United Nationalists causes a riot, and they have to run. Their attempts to escape the violence, which involve the improvised use of explosives, cause the collapse of the set. When the police arrive and announce that \\"no-one is to leave\\", Jake manages to evade questioning by telling Mr Mars to play dead, and carrying him out in his arms, supposedly to find a vet. Jake has to walk all the way back, and spends the night sleeping on a bench. On arriving back at Dave's he finds the cheque from Sammy for ¬£600. Wondering what to do with Mr Mars, Jake asks Dave for help in drafting a blackmail letter, and after much discussion they decide to demand ¬£100. Two telegrams arrive from Madge, bearing a job offer in Paris and an order of ¬£30 for travel expenses. But Dave has to tell Jake that Sammy has cancelled the huge cheque. In dismay, they together decide to pool ¬£50 for a bet on Lyrebird; then Jake leaves for France. Chapters 14‚Äì16: Paris In Paris, Jake is amazed to discover that Jean-Pierre Breteuil's latest novel, Nous les Vainqueurs, has won the Prix Goncourt, and having dismissed Breteuil's work for so long he is amazed and envious. Madge's offer turns out to be a kind of film industry sinecure, and he finds himself refusing it with distaste for reasons that he cannot explain. He realises that it is Bastille Day, and he wanders the city for hours in a daze. In the evening, he is watching fireworks when he sees Anna. He tries to follow her, but the crowd impedes him. He nearly catches up with her in a park, after she leaves her shoes to walk barefoot on the grass. But he briefly loses sight of her, and the woman he accosts is not her. Jake returns to London the next morning to find that Lyrebird has won at long odds, 20-1. Finn has taken his share of the money and disappeared. Several torpid days of inactivity follow, to the despair of Dave. Chapters 17‚Äì20: The hospital Jake takes a job as an orderly at a hospital. When Hugo is admitted (he has been hit in the head with a brick at a political meeting), Jake sees his chance for a serious conversation with his old friend. But as an orderly he is strongly discouraged from talking to patients, and he decides to come back in the middle of the night. He leaves the window of a store-room open. With an immensity of pains, Jake succeeds in reaching Hugo's room shortly after one in the morning. The conversation is not at all what he expected: Hugo is not at all angry with Jake, and it turns out that while Anna is indeed besotted with Hugo, Hugo himself is in love with Sadie, and Sadie with Jake‚Äînot a love triangle, but a one-way love diamond. Hugo demands that Jake help him escape. Jake does so, but they are seen by the hostile porter, Stitch, and Jake knows that he has lost his job. When Jake next goes to Hugo's flat, he finds that Hugo has gone, leaving all he owns to Lefty and his political party. At Mrs Tinckham's, he reads letters from Finn and Sadie. Finn has gone back to Ireland, as he always said he would; Sadie is suggesting he buy Mr Mars for ¬£700, and although this puts Jake back at square one financially, he decides it is the only possible course of action. With Mrs Tinckham, he listens to Anna singing on the radio, and having made his peace with Hugo and with The Silencer he realises that his literary career is just beginning.

Released on 9 November 1979, it features three songs taken from the demo tape recorded at Spaceward Studios on 30 and 31 December 1978. The three tracks (\\"Iron Maiden\\", \\"Invasion\\" and \\"Prowler\\") appear in a rougher form than they would on the band's eponymous debut studio album and subsequent singles, as they were all recorded in one session. Although major retail chains tried to order large quantities of the record, the band only distributed 5,000 copies, available by mail order alone, which sold out in just a few weeks. Because of this, the EP is now a valuable collectors item, having been sold at up to ¬£800 online. Background and recording In the midst of punk rock's peak in the UK, Iron Maiden struggled to secure gigs out of the East End of London and decided that a demo would be an ideal way to try to remedy this. The band decided to record at Spaceward Studios, Cambridge after hearing a demo tape recorded there by former vocalist Dennis Wilcock's band, V1. Although this would be more expensive than recording in London, bassist Steve Harris comments, \\"We decided that doing it on the cheap was a false economy. We knew we'd only probably get one go at it, and we wanted it to sound the best we could.\\" To save money, the band booked a session New Year's Eve weekend 1978, (30/31 December) which cost them ¬£200, and recorded four songs, \\"Prowler\\", \\"Invasion\\", \\"Strange World\\" and \\"Iron Maiden\\". Harris states, \\"We didn't know what to expect, going into the studio for the first time. We just hoped the engineer was gonna be good enough to record us, and that was it, really. We just went in there with a na√Øve attitude and, as it happens, it was pretty good. The songs were very together already. We didn't have to arrange much. They were very tight, 'cause we were doing them live all the time. We knew exactly what we needed to do. It was just a question of whether we could record it all in time. But we went in and the tracks went down really quick. I think we did most of them in the first take.\\" Following this New Year's Eve session, the band were due to return a few weeks later to remix and rerecord some parts, however, according to guitarist Dave Murray, \\"they wanted an extra ¬£50 off us for the master tape and we just didn't have it on us at the time. And when we went back, two weeks later, they'd already wiped the master and put something else over it! We couldn't believe it. So, in the end, we just had to put it out as it was, which was all from that one mad session down in Cambridge on New Years Eve.\\" In defence of Spaceward's actions, Mike Kemp, the engineer, has since stated that \\"we were as poor as they were and couldn't afford to keep ¬£60 multi-track tapes for every band either... We did our best - I think for ¬£5 a week we would hold them until either they were paid for or the band decided not to keep them any longer, e.g. after a remix. Presumably they did not take that option.\\" Distribution and EP release A short time later, Harris and Murray presented a copy of the tape to a DJ named Neal Kay, then running a heavy metal club in Kingsbury, North West London called the Bandwagon Soundhouse. Impressed with the demo, Kay began playing the tape heavily and eventually \\"Prowler\\" reached No. 1 in the Soundhouse charts, which were published in Sounds magazine. In addition to gaining the band exposure in Sounds, the demo tape also reached Rod Smallwood, who would soon become the group's manager and help them acquire their record deal with EMI Records in December 1979. In late 1979, while waiting to sign their deal with EMI, the band decided to release the demo on their own label, Rock Hard Records, on 9 November 1979. Entitled The Soundhouse Tapes after Kay's club, Steve Harris explains that they decided to release the EP \\"because everywhere we'd go we'd do really well at the gigs, and then afterwards there'd be, like, all these fans asking where they could buy one of our records and when we told 'em there wasn't any yet they couldn't believe it. They'd seen the charts in Sounds and a lot of 'em just assumed we must already have a record deal of some kind, but we didn't. Not then. So then, they'd be, like, 'Well, where can we get a copy of the tape?' And I think that's when we really got the idea of putting the Spaceward demo out as an actual record.\\" Although the original demo had included four songs, \\"Strange World\\" was excluded from the record as the band were unsatisfied with the quality of the track's production. Deciding to release the EP as a memento for fans, the group only printed 5,000 copies, 3,000 of which were sold by mail order in the first week. The EP was so successful that Rod Smallwood reports that several fans asked for copies of The Soundhouse Tapes at their local record stores, to the point where HMV and Virgin tried to order 20,000 copies each. Smallwood states, \\"we could have really cashed in at that point. It was our record, not EMI's, and we could have made enough to clear our debts, if we'd wanted to, maybe got it in the charts, even. But there was just no way. It really was something special for the true die-hard Maiden fans, and we'd already made that quite clear. If we'd changed our minds, just to get our hands on a bit of cash, it would have been selling out the kids who'd gone to all the trouble to send in for one of the original 5,000 copies. We thought, 'No, we'll wait until we can do it properly with EMI.'\\" Today, the EP is considered a valuable collector's item, with Record Collector reporting in 2011 that copies of the original have been purchased at up to ¬£800.

(From left to right: German prelate alt= The Reichskonkordat (\\"Concordat between the Holy See and the German Reich\\") is a treaty negotiated between the Vatican and the emergent Nazi Germany. It was signed on 20 July 1933 by Cardinal Secretary of State Eugenio Pacelli, who later became Pope Pius XII, on behalf of Pope Pius XI and Vice Chancellor Franz von Papen on behalf of President Paul von Hindenburg and the German government. It was ratified 10 September 1933 and it has been in force from that date onward. The treaty guarantees the rights of the Roman Catholic Church in Germany. When bishops take office Article 16 states they are required to take an oath of loyalty to the Governor or President of the German Reich established according to the constitution. The treaty also requires all clergy to abstain from working in and for political parties. Nazi breaches of the agreement began almost as soon as it had been signed and intensified afterwards leading to protest from the Church including in the 1937 Mit brennender Sorge encyclical of Pope Pius XI. The Nazis planned to eliminate the Church's influence by restricting its organizations to purely religious activities.Coppa, Frank J. Editor Controversial Concordats, 1999, p. 143, The Reichskonkordat is the most controversial of several concordats that the Vatican negotiated during the pontificate of Pius XI. It is frequently discussed in works that deal with the rise of Hitler in the early 1930s and the Holocaust. The concordat has been described by some as giving moral legitimacy to the Nazi regime soon after Hitler had acquired quasi-dictatorial powers through the Enabling Act of 1933, an Act itself facilitated through the support of the Catholic Centre Party. The treaty places constraints on the political activity of German clergy of the Catholic Church. Following the passage of the 1935 Nuremberg Laws for example, a policy of nonintervention was followed. The majority of the German church hierarchy regarded the treaty as a symbol of peace between church and state.Beth Griech-Polelle, Bishop von Galen, Roman Catholicism and Nazi Germany. p. 51, 53 From a Roman Catholic church perspective it has been argued that the Concordat prevented even greater evils being unleashed against the Church.Evans, 2008, pp 245-246. Shirer,1990, pp 234-5, Hamm, 1997,p. 136, Gill, 1994, p.57, Kershaw, 2008, p. 332, Paul Oshea; A Cross Too Heavy, Rosenberg Publishing, p. 234-5 Though some German bishops were unenthusiastic, and the Allies at the end of World War II felt it inappropriate, Pope Pius XII successfully argued to keep the concordat in force. It is still in force today. Background The 'Reichskonkordat' between Germany and the Holy See was signed on 30 July 1933 and ratified in September of that year. The treaty was an extension of existing concordats already signed with Prussia and Bavaria Concordats have been used to create binding agreements to safeguard church interests and its freedom to act, particularly in countries that do not have strong jurisprudence guaranteeing government non-interference in religious matters or where the church seeks a privileged position under government patronage. ;Kulturkampf Otto von Bismarck became Chancellor of Germany in 1871 and launched the Kulturkampf Culture Struggle against the Roman Catholic Church in Germany. Accounts of 20th-century diplomatic relations between Germany and the Vatican commonly take as their starting point the political scene in the late 19th century.e.g Lewy, 1964, p. 15-16; Carroll, 2002, p. 490; Falconi, 1967, p. 76; \\"A History of Christianity\\", Paul Johnson, 1976, p. 481; Coppa, 1999, p. 121; see also Lapide 1967, p. 99, 104, for clergy making comparisons between Nazi actions and Kulturkampf German Chancellor Bismarck's Kulturkampf (\\"Battle for Culture\\") of 1871‚Äì78 saw an attempt to assert a Protestant vision of nationalism over the new German Empire, and fused anticlericalism with suspicion of the Catholic population, whose loyalty was presumed to lie with Austria and France. The Catholic Centre Party had formed in 1870, initially to represent the religious interests of Catholics and Protestants, but was transformed by the Kulturkampf into the \\"political voice of Catholics\\".Shelley Baranowski; Nazi Empire: German Colonialism and Imperialism from Bismarck to Hitler; Cambridge University Press; 2011; pp. 18‚Äì19 Bismarck's Culture Struggle was largely a failure.Yad Vashem ‚Äì The German Churches in the Third Reich by Franklin F. Littell Bismarck sought to restrict the power of the Catholic Church in Germany. He regarded the Roman Church as \\"the enemy within\\". His Kulturkampf included the disbanding of Catholic organizations, confiscation of church property, banishment or imprisonment of clergy, and an ongoing feud with the Vatican.Carroll, 2002, p. 485‚Äì488 According to novelist James Carroll, the end of Kulturkampf signaled \\"that the Church had successfully resisted to his face the man [Bismarck] who, according to an admiring Henry Kissinger, was 'outmaneuvered' by nobody.\\"Carroll, 2002, p. 494 The Catholic Church's firm resistance to Bismarck and Kulturkampf, including passive resistance by the Church in general and the excommunication of collaborating priests, has been used as benchmark for assessing the Church's response to the Nazis from the early 1930s through World War II.Carroll, 2002, p. 487, 490 ;End of World War I A formal realignment of Church and state relationships was considered desirable in the aftermath of the political instability of 1918 and the adoption of the Weimar constitution for the Reich along with the new constitutions in the German states in 1919.Lewy, 1964, p. 57 Key issues that the Church hoped to resolve related to state subsidies to the Church, support for Catholic schools, the appointment of bishops and the legal position of the clergy.Lewy, 1964, p. 57 The Reich government, in turn, wished for reasons of foreign policy to have friendly relations with the Holy See. Also, Germany wanted to prevent new diocesan boundaries being established which would dilute Germany's ties to ceded German territories in the east such as Danzig and Upper Silesia.Lewy, 1964, p. 58 Negotiations relating to specific points, rather than a general concordat, took place between 1919 and 1922. But even after subsequent feelers were put out between the two parties the negotiations failed, primarily because both the Reichstag and Reichsrat were dominated by non-Catholic majorities who, for a variety of reasons, did not want a formal pact with the Vatican.Lewy, 1964, p. 58 In the absence of an agreement relating to particular areas of concern with the Reich, the Holy See concluded more wide-ranging concordats with three German states where Catholics were concentrated: Bavaria (1924), Prussia (1929), and Baden (1932).Lewy, 1964, p. 58 ;Pope Pius XI Pius XI was elected Pope in 1922. His pontificate coincided with the early aftermath of the First World War. The old European monarchies had been largely swept away and a new and precarious order formed across the continent. In the East, the Soviet Union arose. In Italy, the Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini took power, while in Germany, the fragile Weimar Republic collapsed with the Nazi seizure of power.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online: \\"Pius XI\\"; web Apr. 2013 Pope Pius's major diplomatic approach was to make concordats. However, wrote Hebblethwaite, these concordats did not prove \\"durable or creditable\\" and \\"wholly failed in their aim of safeguarding the institutional rights of the Church\\" for \\"Europe was entering a period in which such agreements were regarded as mere scraps of paper\\".Peter Hebblethwaite, Paul VI: The First Modern Pope. Harper Collins Religious. 1993, p.118 In 1929, Pius signed the Lateran Treaty and a concordat with Italy, confirming the existence of an independent Vatican City state, in return for recognition of the Kingdom of Italy and an undertaking for the papacy to be neutral in world conflicts. In Article 24 of the concordat, the papacy undertook \\"to remain outside temporal conflicts unless the parties concerned jointly appealed for the pacifying mission of the Holy See\\".Hebblethwaite, p.124 Other major concordats included those signed with Germany (1933), Austria (1935), Yugoslavia (1935), and Latvia (1938). The concordats were generally observed by the countries involved, with the exception of Germany.Lapide, p. 91; who also notes that these concordats appear to have strengthened the anti-Zionist faction with the Roman curia (p. 91); example given of the curia pressurizing the Italian authorities to stop an official who was suspected of Zionist sympathies from being appointed the Jerusalem Consul In October 1929, General Groener pushed the German Foreign Ministry to resolve an issue with the Vatican regarding military chaplains who lacked the ability to administer the sacraments of baptism or matrimony without first obtaining the permission of the local priest or bishop.Lewy, 1964, p. 58 Groener wanted the military to have their own bishop rather than rely on local ordinaries and it was this particular issue that was to mark an important step in the discussions that would ultimately be realized in the concordat with the Vatican.Lewy, 1964, p. 58 In March 1930, the new Papal Secretary of State, Cardinal Pacelli, gave indications that the Vatican would be interested in a concordat with the Reich in the event of any reforms of the Reich's constitution having an adverse effect on the validity of the concordats already agreed between the German states and the Vatican.Lewy, 1964, p. 59 Discussions between the two parties took place between 1931 and 1932 and at one point representatives of the Reich pointed out that Italy had an army Archbishop with Cardinal Pacelli indicating that was because Italy had signed a comprehensive concordat with the Vatican.Lewy, 1964, p. 60‚Äì61 The German negotiators continued to discuss solely on the basis of particular points rather than a general concordat during 1931 but even these were felt to be unlikely to be passed by the Reichstag or the Reichsrat, no matter their political or theological leanings.Lewy, 1964, p. 62 Nazi period=Nazis take power In January 1933, Hitler became Chancellor. The passing of the Enabling Act on 23 March, in part, removed the Reichstag as an obstacle to concluding a concordat with the Vatican.Lewy, 1964, p. 62 Hitler offered the possibility of friendly co-operation, promising not to threaten the Reichstag, the President, the States or the Churches if granted the emergency powers. With Nazi paramilitary encircling the building, he said: \\"It is for you, gentlemen of the Reichstag to decide between war and peace.\\"Alan Bullock; Hitler: a Study in Tyranny; Harper Perennial Edition 1991, pp. 147‚Äì48 The Act allowed Hitler and his Cabinet to rule by emergency decree for four years, though Hindenberg remained President.Ventresca, Robert, L. Soldier of Christ: The Life of Pius XII. pp. 78‚Äì81 German Catholics were wary of the new government: In early 1933 Hitler told Hermann Rauschning that Bismarck had been stupid in starting a Kulturkampf and outlined his own strategy for dealing with the clergy which would be based initially on a policy of toleration: > We should trap the priests by their notorious greed and self-indulgence. We > shall thus be able to settle everything with them in perfect peace and > harmony. I shall give them a few years' reprieve. Why should we quarrel? > They will swallow anything in order to keep their material advantages. > Matters will never come to a head. They will recognise a firm will, and we > need only show them once or twice who is the master. They will know which > way the wind blows.Lewy, 1964, p. 26 An initially mainly sporadic persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany followed the Nazi takeover. Hitler was hostile to the Catholic Church, but for political reasons was prepared to restrain his anticlericalism and did not allow himself to be drawn into attacking the Church publicly as other Nazis would have liked him to do.Alan Bullock. Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives. Fontana Press, 1993. pp. 412‚Äì413 Kershaw wrote that, following the appointment of Hitler as Chancellor by President von Hindenberg, the Vatican was anxious to reach agreement with the new government, despite \\"continuing molestation of Catholic clergy, and other outrages committed by Nazi radicals against the Church and its organisations\\".Ian Kershaw; Hitler: A Biography; 2008 Edn; W.W. Norton & Co; London; p. 295 In March 1933, the British Roman Catholic periodical The Tablet in an article titled \\"The Ides of March\\" asserted: > [Hitler's] Dictatorship is a usurpation and his enforcement of it is a > brutality. While we write these lines, with news of more arrests and > repressions coming to us every hour, we remember that we have reached the > Ides of March and the anniversary of a never-forgotten assassination. But > Nazism's daggers cannot slay what is noblest and best in Germany. The > Church, now that the Centre is no longer the key-group in German politics, > may be persecuted; but HITLER will not succeed where BISMARCK failed.\\"The > Ides of March\\", The Tablet, 18 March 1933 Robert Ventresca wrote that because of increasing harassment of Catholics and Catholic clergy, Cardinal Pacelli sought a quick ratification of a treaty with the government, seeking in this way to protect the German Church. When Vice- Chancellor Papen and Ambassador to the Vatican Diego von Bergen met Pacelli in late June 1933, they found him \\"visibly influenced\\" by reports of actions being taken against German Catholic interests.Ventresca, p. 84 There were some thoughts that the Church was keen on coming to terms with Hitler as he represented a strong resistance against Communism. The Papal Nuncio in Berlin (Cesare Osenigo) is reported to have been \\"jubilant\\" about Hitler's rise to power and thought that the new government would soon be offering the same concessions to the Church that Mussolini had made in Italy.Lewy, 1964, p. 27 Historian Michael Phayer balances Lewy and author and journalist John Cormwell stating: Negotiations The Catholic bishops in Germany had generally shown opposition to Hitler from the beginning of his rise to power. When the Nazi Party polled six million votes during the 14 September 1930 election, the Catholic hierarchy called on its people to examine their consciences. During the next two years, though there had been softening by some, the bishops continued to pronounce against unacceptable policies of the Nazi Party.Falconi, 1966, p. 193; Ian Kershaw notes \\"the high level of relative immunity to Nazism which prevailed before 1933 in Catholic circles.\\" Kershaw, The Hitler Myth, Oxford, reissued 2001, p. 36) When Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor on 30 January 1933, the bishops maintained support for the Catholic Centre Party (Zentrum), which in turn refused to assent to a proposal that would allow Hitler to assume full power. On 12 March 1933 Pope Pius XI received the German Cardinal Faulhaber in Rome. On his return Faulhaber reported: > After my recent experience in Rome in the highest circles, which I cannot > reveal here, I must say that I found, despite everything, a greater > tolerance with regard to the new government. ...Let us meditate on the words > of the Holy Father, who in a consistory, without mentioning his name, > indicated before the whole world in Adolf Hitler the statesman who first, > after the Pope himself, has raised his voice against Bolshevism.Falconi, > 1966, p. 194; Falconi notes that the German bishops would remember this > \\"papal eulogy\\" in a joint memorandum to Hitler on 20 August 1935 which > stated \\"In the face of this proclamation of the Pope's confidence, millions > of men abroad, both Catholics and non-Catholics, have overcome their initial > mistrust and accorded credit to your Government.\\" p. 194 At a cabinet meeting on 20 March 1933 Hitler \\"confidently reported\\" that the Centre Party had now seen the necessity of the Enabling Act and that \\"the acceptance of the Enabling Act also by the Zentrum would signify a strengthening prestige with regard to foreign countries.\\"Kershaw, Hitler, 2009, p. 281 Early in March 1933 the bishops recommended that Catholics vote for the Centre Party in the elections scheduled for 5 March 1933. However, two weeks later the Catholic hierarchy reversed its previous policy ‚Äì the bishops now allowed the Centre Party and the Bavarian Catholic Party to vote for the Enabling Act which gave Hitler dictatorial powers on 23 March.Falconi, 1966, p. 193; the Catholic Zentrum Party share of the vote (11.2%) was only slightly down on the previous November poll result. (Kershaw, Hitler, 2009, p. 277) German Catholic theologian Robert Grosche described the Enabling Act in terms of the 1870 decree on the infallibility of the Pope, and stated that the Church had \\"anticipated on a higher level, that historical decision which is made today on the political level: for the Pope and against the sovereignty of the Council; for the Fuhrer and against the Parliament.\\"Carroll, James. Constantine's Sword p. 512, 2002, Houghton Mifflin (Mariner books ed), On 29 March 1933 Cardinal Pacelli sent word to the German bishops to the effect that they must now change their position with regard to National Socialism.Biesinger, Joseph A. essay in Controversial Concordats (Coppa Frank J. ed.). p. 128, fn 26, CUA Press, 1999, On 28 March 1933, the bishops themselves took up a position favourable to Hitler. According to Falconi (1966) the about-turn came through the influence and instructions of the Vatican. Pope Pius XI indicated in Mit brennender Sorge (1937) that the Germans had asked for the concordat, and Pope Pius XII affirmed this in 1945.Lapide, p. 101 Falconi viewed the Church's realignment as motivated by the desire to avoid being left alone in opposition and to avert reprisals. After the leader of the Centre Party, Monsignor Kaas, had persuaded the party members to vote for Hitler and the Enabling Act, he left immediately for Rome and on his return on 31 March he was received by Hitler. He returned to Rome accompanied by the Catholic Vice-chancellor von Papen on 7 April with a mandate from Hitler to sound out a concordat with the Vatican.Rhodes, p. 176 On the day they set out for Rome to prepare the way for the concordat the first two anti-Semitic laws (excluding non-Aryans from public office and from the legal profession) were issued in Germany, but this did not impede the discussions.Falconi, p. 207; Lapide (p. 99) notes that on 30 April the leader of an interfaith group asked Cardinal Bertram to help against the boycott of Jewish businesses but was refused because it was purely an economic matter and because Jews had not spoken out when the Church was persecuted. Papen recorded in his memoirs that on his arrival in Rome, the Pope \\"greeted me with paternal affection, expressing his pleasure that at the head of the German State was a man like Hitler, on whose banner the uncompromising struggle against Communism and Nihilism was inscribed.\\"Rhodes, p. 176 In Falconi's opinion the concordat was the price paid by Hitler in order to obtain the support of the German episcopate and the Catholic parties.Falconi, 1966, p. 195 Ian Kershaw viewed the loss of political Catholicism as the sacrifice needed to protect the position of the Catholic Church in Germany.Kershaw, Hitler, 2009, p. 290 According to historian Michael Phayer, the view \\"that the Concordat was the result of a deal that delivered the parliamentary vote of the Catholic Center Party to Hitler, thereby giving him dictatorial power (the Enabling Act of March 1933) ... is historically inaccurate\\".Phayer, Michael, The Catholic Church and the Holocaust (1930‚Äì1965), 2000, p. 18 Cardinal Faulhaber wrote to Cardinal Pacelli on 10 April 1933 advising that defending the Jews would be wrong \\"because that would transform the attack on the Jews into an attack on the Church; and because the Jews are able to look after themselves\\"Martin Rhonheimer, \\"The Holocaust: What Was Not Said\\" First Things Magazine, November 2003. Retrieved 5 July 2009. ‚Äì the latter assertion based on the outcome of the April boycott, which in spite of Nazi efforts had been mostly ignored and abandoned after only one day. On 22 April 1933 the British Minister to the Vatican recounted what the Vatican Under-Secretary of State had told him: \\"The Holy See is not interested in the Centre Party. We are more concerned with the mass of Catholic voters in Germany than in the Catholic deputies who represent them in the Reichstag.\\"Rhodes, p. 176 Previously, as part of the agreement surrounding the 1929 Lateran Treaty with the Fascist government in Italy, the Vatican had consented to the dissolution of the Catholic political Partito Popolare partyCarroll, 2002, p. 499 which dissolved in 1926. At a 26 April meeting with Bishop Wilhelm Berning of Osnabr√ºck, representative of the German Bishops' Conference, Hitler declared: The notes of the meeting do not record any response by Berning. In the opinion of Martin Rhonheimer, who cites the above transcript, \\"This is hardly surprising: for a Catholic Bishop in 1933 there was really nothing terribly objectionable in this historically correct reminder. And on this occasion, as always, Hitler was concealing his true intentions.\\" Saul Friedl√§nder interpreted Hitler's comments as an attempt to \\"blunt possible Catholic criticism of his anti-Jewish policies and to shift the burden of the arguments onto the Church itself.Friedl√§nder, pp. 46‚Äì47 Edith Stein wrote a letter to Pius XI in April 1933 about the persecution of the Jews in Nazi Germany. The text of the letter is easily accessible on the internet. She never asked him to issue an encyclical on the matter, as some have contended. The letter was answered by Cardinal Pacelli. See William William, \\"Edith Stein's Letter,\\" Inside the Vatican, March 2003, 22-31. (Edith Stein died in the gas chamber at Auschwitz on 9 August 1942). The issue of the concordat prolonged Kaas's stay in Rome, leaving the Centre Party without a chairman, and on 5 May Kaas finally resigned from his post. The party then elected Heinrich Br√ºning as its chairman. At that time, the Centre party was subject to increasing pressure in the wake of the process of Gleichschaltung and after all the other parties had dissolved (or were banned, like the SPD). The Centre Party dissolved itself on 5 July 1933, as the concordat between the Vatican and the Nazis had dealt it a decisive blow by exchanging a ban on the political activities of priests for the continuation of Catholic education. Cardinal Pacelli and von Papen initialled the concordat in Rome three days later, with signing taking place on 20 July.Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives, Alan Bullock, p. 355, Harper Collins, 1991, ; Lapide, p. 101 On 2 July the Vatican daily newspaper L'Osservatore Romano insisted that the concordat wasn't an endorsement of Nazi teachings.Carroll, p. 505. On 13 July a British minister had an interview with Cardinal Pacelli and reported: \\"His Eminence said that the Vatican really viewed with indifference the dissolution of the Centre Party.\\"Rhodes, p. 176 At the 14 July cabinet meeting Hitler brushed aside any debate on the details of the concordat, expressing the view \\"that one should only consider it as a great achievement. The concordat gave Germany an opportunity and created an area of trust which was particularly significant in the developing struggle against international Jewry.\\"Friedl√§nder, Saul. Nazi Germany and the Jews Vol 1, p. 49 Saul Friedl√§nder speculates that Hitler may have countenanced in this \\"area of trust\\" what he perceived as the Christian Church's traditional theological antipathy towards Jews (see Hitler's comments above to Berning on 26 April) converging with Nazi aims. Hitler \\"underlined the triumph\\" that the Concordat meant for the Nazi regime. Only a short time earlier he had expressed doubts that \\"the church would be ready to commit the Bishops to this state. That this has happened, was without doubt an unreserved recognition of the present regime.\\"Kershaw, Ian. Hitler p. 295, Penguin, 2009, On 22 July 1933 von Papen attended a meeting of the Catholic Academic Union, during which he first made the connection between the dissolution of the Centre Party and the concordat. He said the Pope was particularly pleased at the promised destruction of Bolshevism and that Pius XI had agreed to the treaty \\"in the recognition that the new Germany had fought a decisive battle against Bolshevism and the atheist movement.\\"Carroll, p. 520 Papen noted that there was \\"an undeniable inner connection between the dissolution of the German Center party that has just taken place and the conclusion of the Concordat\\" and ended his speech with a call for German Catholicism to put away former resentments and to help build the Third Reich.Lewy, 1964, p. 86 Abbot Herwegen told the meeting: > What the liturgical movement is to the religious realm, fascism is to the > political realm. The German stands and acts under authority, under > leadership ‚Äì whoever does not follow endangers society. Let us say 'yes' > wholeheartedly to the new form of the total State, which is analogous > throughout to the incarnation of the Church. The Church stands in the world > as Germany stands in politics today. On 23 July a British minister met Cardinal Pacelli, who appeared \\"very satisfied\\" with the signing of the concordat. The cardinal expressed the view that, with the guarantees given relating to Catholic education, this concordat was an improvement over the 1929 agreement with Prussia.Rhodes, p. 177 Cardinal Pacelli did sound a note of caution in that his satisfaction was based on the assumption that the German Government \\"remained true to its undertaking\\", but noted also that Hitler \\"was becoming increasingly moderate\\".Rhodes, p. 177 On 24 July Cardinal Faulhaber sent a handwritten letter to Hitler, noting that \\"For Germany's prestige in the East and the West and before the whole world, this handshake with the papacy, the greatest moral power in the history of the world, is a feat of immeasurable importance.\\"Lapide, p. 102 On 4 August 1933 the British Minister reported \\"in conversations I have had with Cardinal Pacelli and Monsignor Pizzardo, neither gave me the feeling of the slightest regret at the eclipse of the Centre [Party], and its consequent loss of influence in German politics\\".Rhodes, p. 176; On 23 June 1939 von Bergen wrote \\"Cardinal Pacelli told me that the fate of the Concordat depends upon the handling of the Germans' wish for diminution of the political work by priests.\\" (Rhodes, p. 176) On 19 August Ivone Kirkpatrick had a further discussion with Cardinal Pacelli in which he expressed his \\"disgust and abhorrence\\" at Hitler's reign of terror to the diplomat. Pacelli said \\"I had to choose between an agreement on their lines and the virtual elimination of the Catholic Church in the Reich.\\"Lapide, pp. 102‚Äì103 Pacelli also told Kirkpatrick that he deplored the persecution of the Jews, but a pistol had been held to his head and that he had no alternative, being given only one week to decide.Lapide, p. 103 Pinchas Lapide notes that whilst negotiations for the concordat were taking place, pressure had been put on the Vatican by the arrest of ninety-two priests, the searching of Catholic youth-club premises, and the closing down of nine Catholic publications.Lapide, p. 103 The Nazi newspaper V√∂lkischer Beobachter wrote: \\"By her signature the Catholic Church has recognised National Socialism in the most solemn manner. ...This fact constitutes an enormous moral strengthening of our government and its prestige.\\" The concordat was ratified on 10 September 1933 and Cardinal Pacelli took the opportunity to send a note to the Germans raising the topic of the social and economic condition of Jews who had converted to Catholicism but of not Jews in general.Friedl√§nder, p. 47, see also Lapide (p. 104) who also gives a date of 9 September for ratification Meanwhile, although the Protestant churches, being local congregations, remained unaffected by restrictions on foreign support, Hitler's government negotiated other agreements with them which in essence put Nazi officials, most of whom were Catholics, into positions of influence or outright authority over Protestant churches. Foreseeing the potential for outright State control of their churches which these agreements portended, many Protestant church leaders simply reorganized their congregations out of the agreements, causing a schism within the Protestant Churches. These Protestant resisters attempted to rally Catholic prelates to the dangers portended by these agreements but were simply rebuffed when the Reichskonkordat was ratified. Many of the Protestant clergy who opposed the Nazi religious program (Bekennende Kirche or Confessing Church) later suffered imprisonment or execution. Church leaders were realistic about the concordat's supposed protections. Cardinal Faulhaber is reported to have said: \\"With the concordat we are hanged, without the concordat we are hanged, drawn and quartered.\\"\\"The Record of Pius XII's Opposition to Hitler\\" Catholic Culture After the signing of the concordat the papal nuncio exhorted the German bishops to support Hitler's r√©gime.Phayer, 2000, p. 45 The bishops told their flocks to try to get along with the Nazi r√©gime.Phayer, 2000, p. 114 According to Michael Phayer, the concordat prevented Pius XI from speaking out against the Nazi Nuremberg Laws in 1935, and though he did intend to speak out after the nationwide pogrom of 1938, Cardinal Pacelli dissuaded him from doing so.Phayer, 2000, p. 18 On 20 August 1935 the Catholic Bishops conference at Fulda reminded Hitler that Pius XI had: > exchanged the handshake of trust with you through the concordat ‚Äì the first > foreign sovereign to do so. ...Pope Pius spoke high praise of you. > ...Millions in foreign countries, Catholics and non-Catholics alike, have > overcome their original mistrust because of this expression of papal trust, > and have placed their trust in your regime. In a sermon given in Munich during 1937 Cardinal Faulhaber declared: > At a time when the heads of the major nations in the world faced the new > Germany with reserve and considerable suspicion, the Catholic Church, the > greatest moral power on earth, through the Concordat, expressed its > confidence in the new German government. This was a deed of immeasurable > significance for the reputation of the new government abroad. The concordat The Treaty with Additional Protocol [in brackets] was signed 20 July 1933. It was ratified and in force starting 10 September 1933 and remains in force today. The text of the concordat was released 22 July 1933 and began with a preamble that set out the common desire of both parties for friendly relations set-out in a solemn agreement.Lewy, 1964, p. 79 Preamble His Holliness Pope Pius XI and the President of the German Reich [Paul von Hindenburg], led by their common desire to consolidate and enhance the existing friendly relations between the Catholic Church and the state in the whole territory of the German Reich in a stable and satisfactory manner for both parties, have decided to conclude a solemn agreement which will supplement the concordats already concluded with some particular German States (Laender) and secure for the others the principles of a uniform treatment of the questions involved. His Holiness Pope Pius XI has appointed as his plenipotentiary [a diplomat granted full power to represent] His Eminence the Most Revered Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, His Holiness' Secretary of State; and the President of the German Reich [Paul von Hindenburg] has appointed as plenipotentiary the Vice-Chairman of the German Reich, Herr Franz von Papen; who, having exchanged their proper form have agreed to the following articles.Translated and edited by Sidney Z. Ehler and John B. Morall (Westminster, Maryland, The Newman Press, 1954), pp. 487-496 Additional Protocol {in brackets} When the signing of the concordat concluded today between the Holy See and the German Reich, the undersigned, being duly empowered to do so, have formulated the following explanations which form an integral part of the concordat itself.Translated and edited by Sidney Z. Ehler and John B. Morall (Westminster, Maryland, The Newman Press, 1954) * Article 1 The German Reich guarantees freedom of profession and public practice of the Catholic religion. It recognizes the right of the Catholic Church to regulate and manage her own affairs independently within the limits of the law applicable to all and to issue ‚Äì within the framework of her own competence ‚Äì laws and ordinances binding on her members.Translated and edited by Sidney Z. Ehler and John B. Morall,(Westminster, Maryland, The Newman Press, 1954) pp. 487-496 The vagueness of the article would later lead to contradictory interpretations.Lewy, 1964, pp. 80‚Äì85 * Article 2 The concordats concluded with Bavaria (1924), Prussia (1929) and Baden (1932) and the rights and privileges of the Catholic Church recognized therein remain unchanged within the territory of the States (Laender) concerned. For the rest of the states provisions of the present concordat shall be fully applicable. These provisions shall also be binding for the said three states in so far as they are relative to matters not regulated by the concordats concluded with those states, or in so far as they complete the arrangements already made. Affirms the state concordats, L√§nderkonkordate, with Bavaria (1924), Prussia (1929), and Baden (1932) remain valid. * Article 3 In order to foster good relations between the Holy See and the German Reich, an apostolic nuncio will continue to reside, as hitherto, in the capital of the German Reich and an ambassador of the German Reich will reside with the Holy See. (With regard to Art. 3. In accordance to the exchange between the apostolic nunciature and the Reich foreign office on the 11 and 12 March respectively, the apostolic nuncio to the German Reich shall be the dean of the diplomatic corps accredited in Berlin.) Confirms the Vatican having a Papal Nuncio (diplomat) in Berlin and the German government having an ambassador in Rome. * Article 4 The Holy See shall enjoy full freedom in its contact and correspondence with the bishops, clergy and all other members of the Catholic Church in Germany. The same applies to the bishops and other diocesan authorities in their contact with the faithful in all matters of their pastoral office. Instructions, ordinances, pastoral letters, official diocesan gazettes and other enactments concerning the spiritual guidance of the faithful, issued by the ecclesiastical authorities within the framework of their competence, may be published without hindrance and made known to the faithful in the ways heretofore usual. Article 4 assures the Holy See of full freedom to communicate with the German clergy and for the German bishops to communicate with the laity \\"in all matters of their pastoral office.\\" The words of qualification in this clause would later be interpreted by the Nazis in its most narrow meaning to limit the Church communications to worship and ritual only.Lewy, 1964, p. 80 * Article 5 The clergy enjoy in the discharge of their spiritual activities the same protection of the state as state officials. The state will proceed according to general provisions of its law in case of any outrage directed against any clergy personally or against their ecclesiastical character or in case of any interference with duties of their office and, if necessary, will provide official protection. * Article 6 Clerics and religious are exempt from the obligation to undertake public offices and such obligations as are incompatible with their clerical or religious status. This applies particularly to the office of magistrate, member of a jury in law courts, membership of taxation committees or membership of the fiscal tribunal. * Article 7 A member of the clergy can accept an official function or appointment in the state or in any publicly constituted corporation dependent on the state only after having received the nihil obstat of his diocesan ordinary [bishop], as well as that of the ordinary competent for the place where the seat of the corporation is situated. For important reasons in which the interests of the Church are involved, the nihil obstat can be withdrawn at any time. * Article 8 The official income of the clergy is exempt from distraint to the same extent as the official salary of the civil servants of the Reich and of the states. * Article 9 The judicial and other authorities cannot ask the clergy to give information about matters which have been entrusted to them while exercising the care of souls and which are consequently covered by the obligation of pastoral secrecy. * Article 10 The wearing of clerical dress or of a religious habit by lay persons or by clerics or religious who have been forbidden to wear it on the strength of a final and valid decision of the competent Church authority ‚Äì officially communicated to the state authorities ‚Äì shall be punished by the state with the same penalties as the misuse of a military uniform. Articles 5‚Äì10 dealt with the status of the clergy under German law. Priests were given protection against any interference in their spiritual activities as well as protection against malicious slander or misuse of clerical dress. Exemption from jury service, and like obligations, was guaranteed and the secrecy of the confessional guaranteed. Members of the clergy could only accept a state appointment so long as the bishop approved and this permission could be withdrawn at any time for important reasons. * Article 11 The present organization and delimitation (boundaries) of the Roman Catholic dioceses in the German Reich remains at it is. If, however, the rearrangement of a bishopric or of an ecclesiastical province, or any other changes in the delimitation of diocese appear necessary in the future, they will be subject to agreement with the government of the state concerned in case that they involve changes only with boundaries of one German state (Land). In case of rearrangement of changes which exceed the boundaries of one German state, the agreement is to be made with the Reich government, to whose care it shall be left secure the consent of the state governments in question. The same applies to the establishment of new ecclesiastical provinces or alterations therein if these involve several German states. The foregoing provisions are not applicable to the shifting of boundaries which is made only with regard to the local care of souls. In case of a wider reorganization within the German reich, the Reich government shall consult with the Holy See with a view to such regrouping of dioceses and to their delimitation. * Article 12 Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 11, ecclesiastical offices can be freely established and altered if no subsidy is asked for from the state funds. The co-operation of the state in establishing and changing the parish communities shall proceed according to the rules which have been arranged with the diocesan bishops; the Reich government will endeavor to achieve a uniform formulation by the state governments of their rules as far as possible. Articles 11‚Äì12 specified that diocesan boundaries had to be made subject to government approval and that ecclesiastical offices could be established if no state funding was involved. * Article 13 Catholic parishes and diocesan associations, episcopal sees, bishoprics and chapters, religious orders and congregations, as well as institutions, foundations and property of the Catholic Church administered by ecclesiastical authorities, shall retain or acquire respectively juridical personality, recognized by the State according to the general provisions of civil law. They shall remain publicly recognized corporations as far as they have been such hitherto; the same rights may be granted to the others in accordance with the general law applicable to all. (With regard to Art. 13. It is understood that the right of the Church to levy taxes is guaranteed.) Article 13 gave to parishes, Episcopal sees, religious orders, etc. juridical personality and granted the same rights as any other publicly recognised body \\"in accordance with the general law as applicable to all\\" which subjected the church's prerogatives to legal regulation under civil law. Guenter Lewy viewed this qualification as establishing \\"a pandora's box of troubles\\" when the law was effectively in the hands of a regime who wanted to control the church. * Article 14 As a rule, the Church has the right to appoint freely to all the Church dignities and benefices without any co-operation on the part of the state or of the civil corporations, unless any other arrangement has been made in previous concordats mentioned in Article 2. As for the appointment to the metropolitan see of Freiburg, in the diocese of the Upper Rhine, it shall be applicable to the two suffragan [subordinate] bishoprics of Rottenburg and Mainz, as well as to the bishoprics of Meissen. The same applies in the said two suffragan bishoprics as regards the appointments to the cathedral chapters and the settlement of the rights of patronage. Furthermore, agreement has been reached on the following points. (i) Catholic clerics who enjoy a spiritual office in Germany or exercise there a pastoral or educational activity, must: (a) be German citizens; (b) have obtained a school certificate (certificate of maturity) entitling them to study at a higher German school; (c) have studied philosophy and theology for at least three years at a German state university, an academic ecclesiastical college in Germany, or a papal high school in Rome. (ii) The Bulls containing appointments of archbishops, bishops, coadjutors cum iure successionis (right of succession) or of a prelatus nullis (a bishop who has jurisdiction independent of a diocese) will not be issued before the name of the selected has been communicated to the Reichsstatthalter in the State (Land) in question, and before it has been ascertained that there are no objections of a general political nature against such a person. The conditions laid down above (i) par (a), (b), (c), can be discarded by mutual agreement between Church and state. (With regard to Art. 14, par. 2, sect. 2. It is understood that if objections of a general political nature exist, they shall be presented as soon as possible. Should they not be presented within twenty days, the Holy See will be entitled to believe there are no objections against the candidate in question. Before an official announcement of the appointment is made, secrecy shall be kept about the candidates concerned. This article does not establish for the state a right to veto.) Article 14 specified appointments of a bishop by the Pope was subject to mutual agreement and communication with the regime that no [general] political impediment existed, while affirming appointments may be made without any co-operation on the part of the state or civil corporations. * Article 15 Religious orders and congregations are not subject, on the part of the state, to any particular restrictions as far as their foundation, their various establishments, the number of their members and their qualifications (save, however, for the previsions of art. 15 par. 2), their pastoral or educational activity, their care of the sick and charitable work, the management of their affairs and the administration of their property are concerned. Superiors of religious orders who have their official residence within the German Reich must have German citizenship. Provincials and superiors whose official residence is situated outside the German territory have the right of visitation of their establishments in Germany, even if they have a foreign citizenship. The Holy See will see to it that the organization of the provinces of various religious orders, as regards their establishments in Germany, should be such as to avoid ‚Äì so far as it can be done ‚Äì the subordination of German establishments to foreign provincials. Exceptions therefrom may be admitted by mutual agreement with the Reich government, particularly in cases where the small number of establishments in Germany makes the formation of German province impracticable or where special reasons exist for the maintenance of a provincial organization rooted in history and working well in practice. Article 15 guaranteed religious orders freedom for pastoral, charitable and educational work. * Article 16 Before taking possession of their diocese, the bishops shall take an oath of loyalty either between the hands of the Reichsstatthalter in the state (Land) in question or between those of the president of the Reich, the formula of which shall be the following: \\"Before God and on the Holy Gospel I swear and promise, as becomes a bishop, loyalty to the German Reich and to the Land of (name of Land). I swear and promise to respect the government established according to the constitution and to cause the clergy of my diocese to respect it. In due solicitude for the welfare and the interests of the German Reich, I will endeavor, while performing the spiritual office bestowed upon me, to prevent anything which might threaten to be detrimental to it.\\" Article 16 specified Bishops must take an oath of loyalty and respect to either the Reich governor of the state concerned or to the President of the Reich as established by the constitution. When the treaty was signed and ratified the word Reich, or the phrase, German Reich, is not in reference to the Third Reich.http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Reich It applies to the period of the Weimar Republic which did not officially and fully collapse until the death of President Paul von Hindenburg 2 August 1934 with the passing of a national referendum vote 19 August 1934 consolidating the Office of Chancellor and President, thereby, declaring Adolf Hitler F√ºhrer of Germany. * Article 17 The property and all other proprietary rights of the publicly recognized corporations, institutions, foundations and associations of the Catholic Church will be guaranteed according to the common law of the state. No building used for public worship can be demolished under any pretext or for any reason whatsoever, except if a mutual agreement has been reached beforehand with the competent ecclesiastical authority. (With regard to Art. 17. In so far as building or land belonging to the state have been devoted to ecclesiastical purposes, they will continue to be devoted to them, with due regard, however, to the contracts which might have been concluded about them.) Article 17 guaranteed, according to the common law, the properties of the church. * Article 18 Should the state payments in kind or money, which are made to the Catholic Church, whether based on law, contract, or any other special legal title, be discontinued, the Holy See and the Reich will proceed in due time beforehand to set up amicable agreement the principles according to which the discontinuation is to be carried out. In this connection, a right derived from a legitimate traditional custom is to be considered as a special legal title. Such discontinuation, implying the cessation of a state payment or obligation, must be adequately compensated in favor of the claimant. Article 18 assured the Church that it would be consulted should the Nazi regime (or existing government) try to discontinue its subsidies to the German Catholic church or other legal title without compensation as specified in Article 138 of the Weimar Constitution for all religious organizations. * Article 19 Catholic theological faculties in state universities shall be maintained. Their relationship to the Church authorities will be regulated by the provisions of the respective concordats and by the protocols annexed to them, with due regard to the ecclesiastical laws relative to these faculties. The Reich will endeavor to secure for all German Catholic faculties in question a uniform regime in accordance with the general spirit of the regulations concerned. (With regard to Art. 19, sent. 2. The basis referred to consists, at the time when this concordat is being concluded, especially of the Apostolic Constitution Deus scienitarum dominus 24 May 1931, and the Instruction of 7 May July 1932.) * Article 20 The Church has the right, unless there is some other agreement, to establish theological and philosophical colleges for the training of clergy; if no state subsidies are claimed for these institutions, they will be dependent solely on the ecclesiastical authorities. The establishment, management and administration of seminaries and hostels for clerical students pertains exclusively, within the limits of the law applicable to all, to ecclesiastical authorities. (With regard to Art. 20. Hostels connected with high and secondary schools and administered by the Church will be recognized, from the taxation stand-point, as being in practice ecclesiastical institutions in the proper sense of the word, and as of diocesan origin.) * Article 21 Catholic religious instruction in primary, vocational, secondary and higher schools is a regular subject of tuition and is to be taught in accordance with the principles of the Catholic Church. In religious instruction the patriotic, civic and social consciousness and sense of duty will be particularly stressed and cultivated, as this is generally done in the school training. The teaching program of religious education and the selection of text books will be settled with by agreement with the higher ecclesiastical authorities. These authorities will be given the opportunity to control, in harmony with the school authorities, whether pupils are receiving religious instruction in accordance with the teaching and requirements of the Church. * Article 22 Mutual agreements shall be arrived at between the bishops and the governments of German states (Laender) with regard to the appointment of the teachers of religion. Teachers who have been declared by the bishop unfit for the further exercise of their teaching function, either for pedagogical reasons or on account of their moral behavior, must not be employed as teachers of religion as long as the obstacle remains. * Article 23 The maintenance of the existing Catholic confessional schools and the establishment of new ones is hereby guaranteed. In all localities where parents or guardians request it, Catholic primary schools will be established if the number of their prospective pupils, considered from the point of view of the local school conditions, appears to be sufficient for the establishment of a school corresponding to the standards prescribed by the state legislation. *Article 24 Only members of the Catholic Church who can be trusted that they will correspond to the special requirements of a Catholic confessional school, can be employed as teachers in all Catholic primary schools. Within the framework of the professional training of teachers, arrangements will be made to guarantee the education and training of Catholic teachers capable of fulfilling the special requirements of Catholic confessional schools. (With regard to Art. 24. In so far as private institutions are able to satisfy, after the new regulations regarding the education of teachers, the general applicable requirements of the state, the existing establishments of religious orders and congregations will be given due consideration in the accordance of recognition.) * Article 25 Religious orders and congregations have the right to establish and run private schools within the limits of the general legislation and conditions laid down by the law. The same qualifications as in state schools can be acquired in these private schools if they follow the teaching program prescribed for state schools. Members of religious orders and congregations are subject, with regard to their employment in private schools, to the general conditions applicable to all. Articles 19‚Äì25 gave protection to the Catholic educational system (Hitler in due course would disregard them). * Article 26 Pending a later and more detailed settlement of matters regarding matrimonial law, it is understood that a church wedding may proceed the civil marriage ceremony not only in the case of a grave illness of one of the fianc√©s which does not permit any delay, but in the case of great moral emergency (which, however, must be confirmed by the competent episcopal authority). In such cases, the parish priest is bound to report the matter at once to the registrar's office. (With regard to Art. 26. It is considered to be a great moral emergency if the timely procuring of documents necessary for the wedding meets with obstacles which are either insuperable or whose removal would be disproportionately costly.) Article 26 allowed that a church wedding could precede a civil marriage ceremony in certain cases. * Article 27 A special and exempt pastoral ministry is conceded to the officers, employees, and men of the Germany army and to their families. An army bishop will be in charge of this pastoral care. His ecclesiastical appointment will be effected by the Holy See after contact has been made with the Reich government in order to select, by mutual agreement, a suitable candidate. The ecclesiastical appointment of the military chaplains and other military clergy will be made by the military bishop after previous consultation with the competent authorities of the Reich. The army bishop can, however, appoint as military chaplains only such priest who have obtained, form their ordinary, permission to engage in military pastoral work and who have obtained an appropriate certificate of fitness. Military chaplains have the rights of parish priests with regard to the troops and other army personnel assigned to their care. An apostolic brief will be issued to regulate in detail the Catholic care of souls in the army. Regulations about the position of army chaplains as state officials will be issued by the Reich government. (With regard to Art. 27, sent. 2. Catholic army officers, personnel and men, as well as their families, do not belong to the local parish communities and are not to contribute to their maintenance. With regard to sent. 4. The apostolic brief will be issued in agreement with the Reich government.) Article 27 regulated the appointment of military chaplains. * Article 28 The Church will be admitted to pastoral visits and to the holding of divine service in hospitals, prisons, and similar public institutions. If a regular care of souls, requiring appointment of clergy as state or public officials, is introduced in such institutions, this will be made by agreement with the higher Church authorities. Article 28 assured the Church the right to pastoral care in hospitals, prisons and like institutions, which would be violated later by the Nazi regime when it refused the Church's request to carry out services in concentration camps. * Article 29 Catholic members of non-German national minorities living within the Reich will not be placed in a worse status with regard to the use of their mother tongue in divine service, religious instruction and Church societies, than is the corresponding legal and practical position of the population of German origin and speech living in the territory of the corresponding foreign state. (With regard to Art. 29. Since the Reich government has shown itself ready to make concessions with regard to non-German minorities, the Holy See declares ‚Äì confirming hereby the principles which it has constantly maintained regarding the right of using the vernacular in the pastoral ministry, religious instruction and in the activities of Catholic associations ‚Äì that it will keep in mind, when concluding future concordats with other countries, the inclusion in them of provisions of a similar value for the rights of German minorities there.) Article 29 granted the same rights to national minorities, with respect to the use of the mother tongue in divine services, as were enjoyed by the German population in the corresponding foreign state. * Article 30 On Sundays and Holy Days a prayer will be said for the welfare of the German Reich and its people in episcopal, parish, affiliated and conventional churches in the German Reich, immediately after the High Mass and according to the rules of the Church liturgy. * Article 31 Catholic organizations and associations whose activity is devoted exclusively to religious, purely cultural and charitable purposes and which are, as such, subordinated to Church authorities, are protected as to their institution and activities. Catholic organizations which, apart from religious cultural or charitable purposes, have other tasks such as social or professional aims, shall also enjoy the protection of this article 31, paragraph 1, even though their organization may be disposed in associations corresponding to states (Laender), provided they guarantee to develop their activities outside political parties. It is reserved to the Reich government and the German episcopate (bishops) to determine by mutual agreement the organizations and associations which fall within the provisions of this article. (With regard to Art. 31, par.4. The principles laid down in par. 4 of this article are equally valid for the labor service.) * Article 32 With regard to the special conditions existing in Germany and with regard to the provisions of the present concordat guaranteeing legislation to protect the rights and privileges of the Catholic Church in the Reich and its states (Laender), the Holy See will issue ordinances by which the clergy and the religious will be forbidden to be members of political parties or to be active on their behalf. (With regard to Art. 32. It is understood that the same provisions, regarding activity in political parties, will be enacted by the Reich for the non- Catholic confessions. The conduct which has been stipulated as a duty for the German clergy and members of religious in Art. 32 does not mean any restriction on their preaching and exposition of the dogmatic and moral teachings and principles of the Church, as it is their duty to do.) Articles 31‚Äì32 relate to the issue of Catholic organizations \\"devoted exclusively to religious, cultural and charitable purposes\\" and empowered the Reich government and German episcopate to \\"determine, by mutual agreement, the organizations and associations which fall within the provisions of this article.\\" Organizations (sponsored by the Catholic Church) that had any political aims no longer had any place in the new Germany; this went without saying and is not even mentioned. Article 32 gave to Hitler one of his principal objectives: the exclusion of the clergy from politics such that \\"the Holy See will issue ordinances by which the clergy and the religious will be forbidden to be members of political parties or to be active on their behalf.\\" Catholic laity, however, were free to form, engage and propagate political parties and seek political office. The Additional Protocol provisions make clear this prohibition of clergy from political activism does not mean they can not preach on moral teachings and principles of the Church \\"as it is their duty to do.\\" * Article 33 All matters regarding clerical persons or Church affairs which have not been mentioned in the preceding articles will be settled, for the sphere of the Church, according to canon law in force. Should a divergence arise, in the future, as to the interpretation or application of any provisions of this concordat, the Holy See and the German Reich will arrive at an amicable solution by mutual agreement. * Article 34 This Concordat, whose German and Italian texts shall have equal binding force, shall be ratified and the certificates of ratification shall be exchanged as soon as possible. It will be enforced from the day of exchange. In witness hereof the plenipotentiaries (representatives) have signed this Concordat. Signed in the two original exemplars, in the Vatican City, 30 July 1933. Signed: Eugenio, Cardinal Pacelli. Signed: Franz von Papen. Article 33 makes provision for settling any difficulties in interpretation of the concordat through \\"amicable solution by mutual agreement.\\" Article 34 calls for the speedy ratification of the concordat. As the document states, It was not in force until its ratification 10 September 1933. An additional secret protocol was added at its signing. When the concordat was ratified 10 September 1933 it granted Catholic clergy certain exemptions from any future universal army conscription call-ups. As Article 27 states, \\"A special and exempt ministry is conceded.\\" As the Treaty of Versailles had forbidden Germany from raising a large army, this provision may have been seen by Hitler as the Vatican giving its tacit approval to German rearmament. Papen wrote to Hitler regarding this secret provision and concluded his brief with, \\"I hope this agreement will therefore be pleasing to you.\\" The provisions of the annexe were inserted at the request of the German Bishops Fulda Conference and the contents were kept so secret that Ernst von Weizsacker, State Secretary in the Foreign Ministry from 1938, did not know of it until informed by the Papal Nuncio Orsenigo in 1939. Reception The British Roman Catholic periodical The Tablet reported the signing of the concordat: > Already it is being said that THE POPE OF ROME thinks of nobody save his own > adherents and that he does not care how Lutherans are dragooned and how Jews > are harried so long as Popish bishops, monastic orders, confessional > schools, and Catholic associations are allowed full freedom. We beg our > Protestant and Jewish friends to put away such suspicions. As we suggested > at the outset of this brief article, the Catholic Church could have done > little for other denominations in Germany if she had begun thrusting out > wild hands to help them while her own feet were slipping under her. By > patience and reasonableness she has succeeded in re-establishing herself, > more firmly than before, on a Concordat which does not surrender one > feather's weight of essential Catholic principle. She will straightway set > about her sacred task, an important part of which will be the casting out of > those devils which have been raging ‚Äì and are raging still ‚Äì in the Reich. > But \\"this sort\\" of devil is not cast out save by prayer. Political action > (from which the German clergy are debarred under the Concordat) by the > Church would drive matters from bad to worse. We are confident, however, > that Catholics will abhor the idea of enjoying complete toleration while > Protestants and Jews are under the harrow, and that, quietly but strongly, > the Catholic influence will be exerted in the right direction. One German > out of three is a Catholic ; and Catholic prestige is high in Germany's > public life.The Tablet, 29 July 1933, p. 5 Criticism of the concordat was initially from those countries who viewed Germany as a potential threat. Le Temps wrote: \\"This is a triumph for the National Socialist government. It took Mussolini five years to achieve this; Germany has done it in a week.\\"Rhodes, p. 177 L'Ere Nouvelle wrote: \\"The contradiction of a system preaching universalism making an agreement with a highly nationalistic state has been repeated throughout Vatican history. The Church never attacks existing institutions, even if they are bad. It prefers to wait for their collapse, hoping for the emergence of a higher morality.Rhodes p. 178 The Polish newspaper Kurjer Poranny wrote on 19 July 1933: \\"Once again we see the methods of the Vatican ‚Äì intransigent with the passive and amenable, but accommodating with the high-handed and ruthless. In the last century it rewarded its persecutor, Bismarck, with the highest Papal decoration, the Order of Christ. ...The Centre Party, which most courageously resisted the Nazis, has been disowned by the Vatican.Rhodes, p. 178 Ex- Chancellor Bruning reported that 300 Protestant pastors who had been on the verge of joining the Catholic Church on account of the stand it had taken against the Nazis abandoned the plan after the signing of the concordat.Rhodes, p. 178 On 24 July, the Nazi newspaper V√∂lkischer Beobachter commented: > The provocative agitation which for years was conducted against the NSDAP > because of its alleged hostility to religion has now been refuted by the > Church itself. This fact signifies a tremendous moral strengthening of the > National Socialist government of the Reich and its reputation.Lewy, 1964, p. > 86 On 26 and 27 July 1933, the Vatican daily newspaper L'Osservatore Romano stressed the advantages gained by the church through the concordat but also insisted that the church had not given up her traditional neutrality towards different forms of political government nor did it endorse a \\"specific trend of political doctrines or ideas.\\"Lewy, 1964, p. 87 The Nazis replied through the German press on 30 July by correcting perceived false interpretations of the concordat and \\"reminding the Vatican\\" that the concordat had been signed with the German Reich which \\"as Rome should know, is completely dominated by the National Socialist trend\\" and therefore \\"the de facto and de jure recognition of the National Socialist government\\" was signaled by the concordat. The Vatican demanded that the German government dissociate itself from these remarks but agreed eventually to forget its complaints so long as the German press refrained from any further \\"harping on the great victory\\" achieved by Nazi Germany. Violations Nazi violations of the concordat commenced almost immediately after it was signed. The Nazis claimed jurisdiction over all collective and social activity, interfering with Catholic schooling, youth groups, workers' clubs and cultural societies.Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair: German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ; p. 136 Hitler had a \\"blatant disregard\\" for the concordat, wrote Paul O'Shea, and its signing was to him merely a first step in the \\"gradual suppression of the Catholic Church in Germany\\".Paul O'Shea; A Cross Too Heavy; Rosenberg Publishing; pp. 234‚Äì35 Anton Gill wrote that \\"with his usual irresistible, bullying technique, Hitler then proceeded to take a mile where he had been given an inch\\" and closed all Catholic institutions whose functions weren't strictly religious:Gill, 1994, p.57 Within the same month of signing the concordat, the Nazis promulgated their sterilization law ‚Äì the Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring ‚Äì a policy the Catholic Church considered deeply offensive. Days later, moves began to dissolve the Catholic Youth League.William L. Shirer; The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich; Secker & Warburg; London; 1960; pp. 234‚Äì35 Clergy, religious sisters, and lay leaders began to be targeted, leading to thousands of arrests over the ensuing years, often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or \\"immorality\\". Priests were watched closely and frequently denounced, arrested and sent to concentration camps.Paul Berben; Dachau: The Official History 1933‚Äì1945; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; ; p. 142 From 1940, a dedicated Clergy Barracks had been established at Dachau concentration camp.Paul Berben; Dachau: The Official History 1933‚Äì1945; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; ; p. 145 Intimidation of clergy was widespread. Cardinal Faulhaber was shot at. Cardinal Innitzer had his Vienna residence ransacked in October 1938, and Bishop Sproll of Rottenburg was jostled and his home vandalised. William Shirer wrote that the German people were not greatly aroused by the persecution of the churches by the Nazi Government. The great majority were not moved to face death or imprisonment for the sake of freedom of worship, being too impressed by Hitler's early foreign policy successes and the restoration of the German economy. Few, he wrote, \\"paused to reflect that the Nazi regime intended to destroy Christianity in Germany, if it could, and substitute the old paganism of the early tribal Germanic gods and the new paganism of the Nazi extremists.\\"William L. Shirer; The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich; Secker & Warburg; London; 1960; p. 240 Anti-Nazi sentiment grew in Catholic circles as the Nazi government increased its repressive measures against their activities. In his history of the German Resistance, Hoffmann writes that, from the beginning:Peter Hoffmann; The History of the German Resistance 1933‚Äì1945; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; p. 14 After constant confrontations, by late 1935, Bishop Clemens August von Galen of M√ºnster was urging a joint pastoral letter protesting an \\"underground war\\" against the church. By early 1937, the church hierarchy in Germany, which had initially attempted to co-operate with the new government, had become highly disillusioned. In March, Pope Pius XI issued the Mit brennender Sorge encyclical ‚Äì accusing the Nazi Government of violations of the 1933 concordat, and further that it was sowing the \\"tares of suspicion, discord, hatred, calumny, of secret and open fundamental hostility to Christ and His Church\\". The Nazis responded with an intensification of the Church Struggle, beginning around April.Ian Kershaw; Hitler: A Biography; 2008 Edn; W.W. Norton & Co; London; pp. 381‚Äì82 When the Nazi government violated the concordat (in particular Article 31), the bishops and the Papacy protested against these violations. Pius XI considered terminating the concordat, but his secretary of state and members of the curia, who feared the impact upon German Catholics, dissuaded him, as they believed it would result in the loss of a protective shield. Cardinal Pacelli acknowledged his role in its retention after the war.\\"Between morality and diplomacy: the Vatican's 'silence' during the Holocaust\\", Coppa, Frank J., Journal of Church and State, 22 June 2008 The flourishing Catholic press of Germany faced censorship and closure. Finally in March 1941, Goebbels banned all Church press, on the pretext of a \\"paper shortage\\".Fred Taylor; The Goebbells Diaries 1939‚Äì1941; Hamish Hamilton Ltd; London; 1982 pp. 278, 294 Catholic schools were a major battleground in the kirchenkampf campaign against the Church. When in 1933 the Nazi school superintendent of M√ºnster issued a decree that religious instruction be combined with discussion of the \\"demoralising power\\" of the \\"people of Israel\\", Bishop Clemens August Graf von Galen of M√ºnster refused, writing that such interference in curriculum was a breach of the concordat and that he feared children would be confused as to their \\"obligation to act with charity to all men\\" and as to the historical mission of the people of Israel.Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair: German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ; p. 139 Often Galen protested directly to Hitler over violations of the concordat. When in 1936, Nazis removed crucifixes in schools, protest by Galen led to public demonstrations.Gill, 1994, p.59 Church kindergartens were closed, crucifixes were removed from schools and Catholic welfare programs were restricted on the basis they assisted the \\"racially unfit\\". Parents were coerced into removing their children from Catholic schools. In Bavaria, teaching positions formerly allotted to sisters were awarded to secular teachers and denominational schools were transformed into \\"community schools\\". When in 1937 the authorities in Upper Bavaria attempted to replace Catholic schools with \\"common schools\\", Cardinal Faulhaber offered fierce resistance.Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair: German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ; pp. 200‚Äì202 By 1939 all Catholic denominational schools had been disbanded or converted to public facilities.Evans, Richard J. (2005). The Third Reich in Power. New York: Penguin. ; pp. 245‚Äì246 World War II From 1940, the Gestapo launched an intense persecution of the monasteries, invading, searching and appropriating them. The Provincial of the Dominican Province of Teutonia, Laurentius Siemer, a spiritual leader of the German Resistance, was influential in the Committee for Matters Relating to the Orders, which formed in response to Nazi attacks against Catholic monasteries and aimed to encourage the bishops to intercede on behalf of the Orders and oppose the Nazi state more emphatically.Laurentius Siemer; German Resistance Memorial Centre, Index of Persons; retrieved at 4 September 2013Memory of Spiritual Leader in German Resistance Lives On; Deutsche Welle online; 21 October 2006 With the expansion of the war in the East from 1941, there came also an expansion of the regime's attack on the churches. Monasteries and convents were targeted and expropriation of Church properties surged. The Nazi authorities claimed that the properties were needed for wartime necessities such as hospitals, or accommodation for refugees or children, but in fact used them for their own purposes. \\"Hostility to the state\\" was another common cause given for the confiscations, and the action of a single member of a monastery could result in seizure of the whole. The Jesuits were especially targeted.John S. Conway; The Nazi Persecution of the Churches, 1933‚Äì1945; Regent College Publishing; p. 255 The Papal Nuncio Cesare Orsenigo and Cardinal Bertram complained constantly to the authorities but were told to expect more requisitions owing to war-time needs.John S. Conway; The Nazi Persecution of the Churches, 1933‚Äì1945; Regent College Publishing; p. 257 Figures like Bishops Clemens August Graf von Galen and Konrad von Preysing attempted to protect German priests from arrest. In Galen's famous 1941 anti-euthanasia sermons, he denounced the confiscations of church properties.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online: \\"Blessed Clemens August, Graf von Galen\\"; web Apr 2013. He attacked the Gestapo for converting church properties to their own purposes ‚Äì including use as cinemas and brothels.Gill, 1994, p.60 He protested the mistreatment of Catholics in Germany: the arrests and imprisonment without legal process, the suppression of the monasteries, and the expulsion of religious orders.Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair: German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ; p. 289‚Äì90 On 22 March 1942, the German Bishops issued a pastoral letter on \\"The Struggle against Christianity and the Church\\".Joachim Fest; Plotting Hitler's Death: The German Resistance to Hitler 1933‚Äì1945; Weidenfeld & Nicolson; London; p. 377 The letter launched a defence of human rights and the rule of law and accused the Reich Government of \\"unjust oppression and hated struggle against Christianity and the Church\\", despite the loyalty of German Catholics to the Fatherland, and brave service of Catholic soldiers:The Nazi War Against the Catholic Church; National Catholic Welfare Conference; Washington D.C.; 1942; pp. 74‚Äì80. In July 1942, Hitler said he viewed the concordat as obsolete, and intended to abolish it after the war, and only hesitated to withdraw Germany's representative from the Vatican out of \\"military reasons connected with the war\\":Hitler's Table Talk 1941‚Äì1944: ch \\"A Hungarian Request\\"; Cameron & Stevens; Enigma Books pp. 551‚Äì56 In fact the Operation Anthropoid commandos were besieged in the Orthodox Saints Cyril and Methodius Cathedral. After World War II Pius XII put a high priority on preserving the concordat from the Nazi era, although the bishops were unenthusiastic about it and the Allies considered the request inappropriate.Phayer, 2000, p. 218 After the war, the concordat remained in place and the Catholic church was restored to its previous position.Ehler, Sidney Z.; Morrall, John B. Church and state through the centuries p. 518-519, org pub 1954, reissued 1988, Biblo & Tannen, 1988, When Lower Saxony passed a new school law, the Holy See complained that it violated the terms of the concordat. The federal government called upon the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) for clarification. In its ruling of 26 March 1957, the court decided that the circumstances surrounding the conclusion of the concordat did not invalidate it. Declaring its lack of jurisdiction in matters of public international law and considering the fact that the German constitution grants authority in school matters to the state governments, the Constitutional Court ruled that the federal government had no authority to intervene. So while the federal government was obligated by the concordat, the court could not enforce its application in all areas because said court lacks legal authority to do so. Critics also say that the concordat undermined the separation of church and state. The Weimar constitution (some of whose regulations, namely articles 136‚Äì139 and 141 were re-enacted in article 140 of the current German constitution) does not speak of a \\"separation\\", but rather rules out any state religion while protecting religious freedom, religious holidays and leaving open the possibility of cooperation. However, there was a continual conflict between article 18 of the concordat and article 138 of the Weimar constitution. Assessment Anthony Rhodes regarded Hitler's desire for a concordat with the Vatican as being driven principally by the prestige and respectability it brought to his regime abroad whilst at the same time eliminating the opposition of the Centre Party.Rhodes, p. 173 Rhodes took the view that if the survival of Catholic education and youth organisations was taken to be the principal aim of papal diplomacy during this period then the signing of the concordat to prevent greater evils was justified.Rhodes, p. 182; Rhodes quotes from an allocution given by Pius XII on 2 June 1945 which lends weight to this interpretation. Many of the Centre Party deputies were priests who had not been afraid to raise their voices in the past and would almost certainly have voted against Hitler's assumption of dictatorial powers.Rhodes, p. 174 The voluntary dissolution of the Centre Party removed that obstacle and Hitler now had absolute power and brought respectability to the state: \\"Within six months of its birth, the Third Reich had been given full approval by the highest spiritual power on earth\\".Rhodes, p. 177 Ian Kershaw considered the role of the Centre Party in Hitler's removal of almost all constitutional restraints as \\"particularly ignominious.\\"Kershaw, Ian. Hitler p. 282. Penguin, 2008, John Cornwell views Cardinal Pacelli as being an example of a \\"fellow traveller\\" of the Nazis who, through the concordat, was willing to accept the generosity of Hitler in the educational sphere (more schools, teachers and student slots), so long as the Church withdrew from the social and political sphere, at the same time as Jews were being dismissed from universities and Jewish student slots were being reduced. He argues that the Catholic Centre Party vote was decisive in the adoption of dictatorial powers by Hitler and that the party's subsequent dissolution was at Pacelli's prompting.Cornwell, John.

They cannot be bribed by prayers or incense. What an insult to the principles of creation. But remember, that for God a thousand years is a day.

A campaign is a series of individual adventures, and a campaign setting is the world in which such adventures and campaigns take place. Usually a campaign setting is designed for a specific game (such as the Forgotten Realms setting for Dungeons & Dragons) or a specific genre of game (such as Medieval fantasy, or outer space/science fiction adventure). There are numerous campaign settings available both in print and online. In addition to published campaign settings available for purchase, many game masters create their own settings, often referred to as \\"homebrew\\" settings or worlds. Types of setting The use of the term \\"world\\" in describing a campaign setting is loose, at best. Campaign worlds such as the World of Greyhawk detail entire cosmologies and timelines of thousands of years, while the setting of a game such as Deadlands might only describe one nation within a brief segment of alternate history. There are three primary types of campaign setting: * The first type of setting is specifically tied to a single game, such as Warhammer or World of Darkness, where the game has only the one setting. * The second type of setting is for games that have multiple settings such as modern Dungeons & Dragons or generic roleplaying systems such as GURPS or Fudge * The third type of setting is developed without being tied to a particular game system. Typically this last sort are developed first as stand-alone works of fiction, which are later adapted to one or more role playing systems such as the Star Wars universe or Middle-earth, though there are a few exceptions of settings which were designed explicitly for role playing gaming, but without a specific system in mind, such as H√¢rn. Setting genres have touched on every genre of high-action fictional storytelling from role-playing's roots in fantasy to science fiction in settings such as Traveller to horror in the World of Darkness. Even modern- day spy thriller-oriented settings such as Spycraft have been introduced. A small number of campaign settings fuse two or more genres in a single game. In GURPS Infinite Worlds, for example, the characters play \\"Infinity Patrol\\" agents who travel to alternate worlds. Shadowrun combines fantasy with cyberpunk, Castle Falkenstein draws on fantasy and steampunk elements, and Torg mixes fantasy, science fiction, pulp and horror elements while Feng Shui combines Chinese historical fantasy with kung fu action tropes and dystopian science fiction. Fantasy Fantasy settings draw their inspiration almost exclusively from fantasy literature, such as the works of J. R. R. Tolkien and Robert E. Howard. The setting in these games is usually a world with a level of technology similar to that of medieval Europe. Fantasy elements include magic and supernatural/mythological creatures, such as dragons, elves, and orcs. The very first role-playing settings from the late 1960s and early 1970s (World of Greyhawk, and Blackmoor) were based in the fantasy genre, primarily based on the popularity of fantasy works by authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis. Over the decades since, fantasy role-playing has evolved and expanded tremendously, even developing its own subgenres. The genre can be subdivided into high fantasy where supernatural events are commonplace, and low fantasy where there are few or no supernatural aspects. While pure fantasy games were initially popular, games such as Ars Magica popularized the notion of fantasy set within elements of real-world history. Later games would update this concept even further, bringing fantasy gaming into the present day in a genre known as urban fantasy (e.g. Mage: The Ascension) or even into the future by combining urban fantasy with cyberpunk (e.g. Shadowrun). Even when the main setting of a game is not taken directly from the history of our world, they still tend to draw heavily on historical models, though distorted by the presence of magic; also, as gods often have direct and tangible interactions with the world, religion is usually very unlike our world. Fantasy typically remains the most played roleplaying genre with the majority of the top five roleplaying games by quarterly sales involving fantasy settings (as seen in sales estimates for 2010-2013Multiple \\"Top 5 RPGs\\" quarterly sales estimates, \\"http://www.icv2.com/\\"). RPGs of the fantasy genre are sometimes collectively called \\"Fantasy roleplaying games\\" (\\"FRP\\"). See Category:Fantasy roleplaying games Science fiction Science fiction settings are inspired by science fiction literature. The setting is generally in the future, sometimes near future but also quite often in the far future, though in many cases the setting bears no connection to the world we live in, e.g. Star Wars. Common elements involve futuristic technology, contact with alien life forms, experimental societies, and space travel. Psionic abilities (i.e. ESP and telekinesis) often take the place of magic. The genre can be divided similarly with science fiction literature into subgenres, such as cyberpunk or space opera. Science fiction settings for role playing were introduced with Metamorphosis Alpha in 1976 -- dungeon adventuring on a \\"lost starship\\" -- and in 1977 soon followed with Traveller, a space opera game. Its Third Imperium setting covered multiple worlds and alien races. Due to the success of Star Wars, and the impact that the franchise had on popular culture, many science fiction settings were introduced or adapted, especially during the 1980s. The scope of a science fiction setting is typically larger than that of a fantasy setting, encompassing multiple worlds or even entire galaxies. Such settings often involve detailed accounts of military and/or trading operations and organizations. Gamma World, introduced in 1978, explored the replacement of traditional elements of fantasy settings with the pseudo-scientific elements of post-apocalyptic fiction. These settings lend themselves to the \\"adventuring\\" mode of most fantasy games, and thus focus on developing specific locations and loosely defined cultural or racial groups. See Category:Science fiction roleplaying games Historical Historical settings take place in the past. Because historical games often overlap the fantasy genre, a distinguishing mark is that fantasy games are set on a \\"fantasy world\\" similar to but distinct from Earth, while historical games are set in the past of Earth. Settings that have been explored in roleplaying games include Pendragon (Arthurian), Sengoku (Japanese warring states), Recon (Vietnam War), Tibet (historical Tibet), and Fantasy Imperium (historical Europe). The roleplaying game Ars Magica is one such 'historical' game, set in what its source materials call 'Mythic Europe': while history is generally accepted to unfold as depicted in real-world historical accounts, Ars Magica presents a detailed background for its setting, tying the existence of magic, wizards and the Faerie realms into a historical context while allowing for 'fantasy' elements to come into play. See Category:Historical roleplaying games Horror Horror settings take their inspiration from horror literature. Horror role-playing can be divided into two major groups. Modern horror settings such as Call of Cthulhu were first introduced in the early 1980s, creating a hybrid of fantasy horror and modern thrillers. These settings tend to focus on organizations and societies in which generally normal people fight against malevolent supernatural entities. Such games often are structured as a straightforward \\"monster hunt\\", though Call of Cthulhu also involves a great deal of investigation and clue-finding. The second style of horror game reverses the roles, with the player characters being such supernatural creatures as vampires and werewolves. This second style was popularized by White Wolf's Vampire: The Masquerade. A series of games by the same company followed, sharing a setting called the World of Darkness. The setting in both these styles of horror games is often contemporary, between the 19th century and the current day. Creating the correct mood and air of suspense is very important in these games. Some elements of fantasy role- playing settings were often related to the horror genre. Vampires and ghosts are typical fare in most such settings, for example. Campaign settings that combine horror and fantasy elements on an even footing include the Dungeons & Dragons settings Ravenloft and Ghostwalk. The D&D; Heroes of Horror sourcebook also provides ways to emphasize horror elements within a more typical fantasy milieu. See Category:Horror roleplaying games Humor Humor games are based on creating situations which are funny or have a funny premise. Humor is not usually a genre in itself (although it can be), but a modifier added to other genres. In 1983 Bureau 13 introduced humorous modern horror/fantasy gaming. In 1984, the Paranoia game introduced a science fiction setting which used a post-apocalypse world in which to set a tongue-in-cheek game of futile struggle against a computer-controlled dictatorship. Humorous settings for multiple genres have since been released. Humorous settings typically develop few if any locations and organizations, focusing instead on specific characters of note and general tone. See Category:Comedy roleplaying games Multi-genre Multi-genre games that mix elements of different genres together. For example, Deadlands presents a Wild West in which elements of horror and magic are prevalent, and Castle Falkenstein presents a Victorian- era world with Jules Verne- and H. G. Wells-inspired technology alongside fantasy elements like magics and the denizens of Faerie. Similarly, Shadowrun presents a futuristic dystopia that draws heavily from Cyberpunk influences such as cyberized limbs, megacorporations and the virtual reality internet in the form of the Matrix, while also including, as a major plot element, the return of magic to the world and the classic Dungeons and Dragons races of elves, dwarfs, trolls and so forth. Likewise, the superhero genre typically emulates the comic book universes such as the DC and Marvel Universes as a form of science fantasy set in contemporary setting where all fantastic elements from futuristic technology to mythic beings co-exist. More extreme mashups are also possible; Torg combined fantasy, science fiction, pulp, and horror elements while Feng Shui combined Chinese historical fantasy with Kung Fu action tropes and dystopian science fiction. In GURPS Infinite Worlds, the characters played \\"Infinity Patrol\\" agents who travel to alternate worlds characterized by different genre elements including steampunk and horror. Licensed Licensed games are tie-ins to larger media franchises. They were once rare but the number of these games is increasing. Licensed games are usually considered part of their franchise's genre rather than a genre in and of themselves. Many licensed products are now defunct because of license expiration, while others such as Blood of Heroes take a system designed for a licensee's game world and create a new world to match it.

It included two highly advanced miniature space probes that were sent to Mars aboard the Mars Polar Lander in January 1999. The probes were named \\"Scott\\" and \\"Amundsen\\", in honor of Robert Falcon Scott and Roald Amundsen, the first explorers to reach the Earth's South Pole. Intended to be the first spacecraft to penetrate below the surface of another planet, after entering the Mars atmosphere DS2 was to detach from the Mars Polar Lander mother ship and plummet to the surface using only an aeroshell impactor, with no parachute.

They rode to Mars aboard another spacecraft, the Mars Polar Lander. Upon arrival near the south polar region of Mars on December 3, 1999, the basketball-sized shells were released from the main spacecraft, plummeting through the atmosphere and hitting the planet's surface at over . On impact, each shell was designed to shatter, and its grapefruit-sized probe was to punch through the soil and separate into two parts. The lower part, called the forebody, was designed to penetrate as far as into the soil. The upper part of the probe, or aftbody, was designed to remain on the surface in order to radio data to the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft in orbit around Mars. The Mars Global Surveyor would act as a relay in order to send the data collected back to Earth. The two sections of the probe were designed to remain connected via a data cable.  Mission failure  The probes reached Mars along with the Mars Polar Lander mission, apparently without incident, but communication was never established after impact. It is not known what the cause of failure was. A failure review board was commissioned to report on the failures of the Mars Polar Lander and Deep Space 2 probes. The review board was unable to identify a probable cause of failure, but suggested several possible causes: * The probe radio equipment had a low chance of surviving the impact. * The batteries may have failed on impact. * The probes may have bounced on impact. * The probes may have landed on their sides, resulting in bad antenna performance or radio link geometry. * The probes may simply have hit ground that was too rocky for survival. * The batteries on the probes, which had been charged prior to launch almost a year earlier, might not have retained sufficient power. The board concluded that the probes and their components were not tested adequately before launch.

Originally introduced in the Planescape campaign setting in the second edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, they became one of the primary races available for player characters in the fourth edition of the game.Heinsoo, Rob, Andy Collins, and James Wyatt. Player's Handbook. (Wizards of the Coast, 2008) In the Planescape setting, where Tieflings were originally introduced, they were described as being a mixture of human and \\"something else\\" with the implication that the medium-sized non-human ancestors originated from the evil \\"lower planes\\". In further supplements it was clarified that Tieflings were usually descended from fiends but not the same as half-fiends, since a Tiefling's fiendish ancestry lies further up the family tree. This description remained true in 3rd Edition. In 4th Edition Dungeons & Dragons, tieflings are a race whose human ancestors made a bargain with devils to increase their power. Their origin is similar in 5th Edition. Tiefling Ranger Name The name, pronounced , was derived by Wolfgang Baur from German tief meaning \\"deep, low\\", and the suffix -ling, \\"offspring,\\" alluding to their origins in the \\"lower planes\\" (in the 2nd and 3rd editions); it may also allude to Teufel, German for \\"devil.\\" Publication history One of the first artists to depict the tiefling was Tony DiTerlizzi.

Fictional history In the setting of Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition, the tieflings trace their origins to the ancient human Empire of Bael Turath. In the Empire, the noble class was completely obsessed with preserving and gaining power. Rumors of their schemes and obsession with power reached a realm called the Nine Hells, located around the Astral Sea. The devils that resided in the Nine Hells gave the ruling classes of Bael Turath visions while they slept, containing the directions for a grisly, month-long ritual that would extend their rule into eternity. The details of the ritual have been left unclear in the books from the Player's Handbook series describing the events, though it is described as being very horrible. As the ritual demanded the participation of every noble house, those that refused were wholly slaughtered. Once this was done, the ruling class began their ritual. Afterwards, devils from the Nine Hells began to appear, and the nobles gladly made pacts with them. These pacts gave power to the nobles and their descendants forever, but also gave them the devilish features of horns, non-prehensile tails, sharp teeth, and red skin. From that point forward, the former humans were the race known as the tieflings. In the 5th Edition, the overlord of the Nine Hells, Asmodeus, is cited as the ancestral source of their devilish features. Aspects In earlier versions of Dungeons & Dragons, 3.5 and previous, tieflings have any of a number of features that reference (directly or indirectly) their fiendish lineage. These include horns located on their heads, pointed sharp teeth, extra fingers, cloven hooves in place of feet, tails, and unusually colored eyes. They exude a feeling of \\"evil\\" even though their race has become civil and no longer lusts for power. Many races distrust or outright hate tieflings, seeing them as devil worshippers. Tiefling villains often live up to this reputation, whereas player characters have the choice to abandon this stereotype. In 4th edition and later, tieflings are a core character race and have had their appearance altered from 3.5 and earlier. All tieflings possess large thick horns of various styles on their heads, prehensile tails approximately 4 to 5 feet in length, sharply pointed teeth, and their eyes are solid orbs of red, black, white, silver, or gold. Tiefling skin ranges through common human shades right into the reds, ranging from brick red to a ruddy tan. Tiefling hair, which starts behind their horns, ranges from dark blue to purple to red in addition to more normal human colors. Within the setting of Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition, tieflings are characterized as charismatic and self-reliant, and make excellent warlocks, warlords, and wizards. In Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition, tieflings do not associate with a specific god or gods. Their lack of faith also means paladins and clerics are seldom, if ever, found. Tieflings have no homeland and are very rare due to a long-lasting war with the dragonborn, another race seen in the 4th edition of Dungeons & Dragons. Most tieflings prefer to be adventurers and rarely ever adventure with their own kin due to the prejudices of other races (people are concerned when two or more of their kind travel together). In most editions, tiefling naming conventions consist of ancestral Infernal names. In 3.5, tieflings use human names until they seek to differentiate themselves from their parents, after which they usually take fiendish \\"names\\" of Infernal or Abyssal origin that sound menacing. In 4.0 onwards, tieflings usually take an ancestral Infernal name, although some young tieflings, striving to find a place in the world, choose a name that signifies a concept and then try to embody the concept. In most editions, tieflings are described as slow to trust, but those who do earn their trust and loyalty earn a firm friend or ally for life. Alignment Unlike half- fiends, tieflings are not necessarily of evil alignments. Tieflings of all alignments exist, including good, although many take more shady jobs, such as that of thieves, assassins or spies. Tieflings are often portrayed as antiheroes. In a standard 3.0 and 3.5 game, tieflings tend to have an unsettling air about them, and most people are uncomfortable around them, whether they are aware of the tiefling's unsavory ancestry or not. In 4th edition, tieflings have the same alignment choices as any other starting character. In 5th edition, tieflings do not have an innate tendency towards evil, though many usually end up going down that path due to the prejudice against them. Also due to the prejudice against them, tieflings have a fierce independent streak and are inclined towards being chaotic. In various campaign settings Tieflings appear in a number of campaign settings, including the following notable examples: In the Forgotten Realms In the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, both tieflings and aasimar are more common than in other settings. Tieflings even have elven and orc counterparts (Fey'ri and Tanarruk, respectively). In the 3rd Edition of Dungeons and Dragons, less common varieties of the tiefling were introduced, including a dwarven counterpart, the Maeluth and a halfling counterpart, the Wispling. In Planescape In the Planescape campaign setting, tieflings are a common race available to player characters, though they are mistrusted and reviled by many inhabitants of the planes. In Pathfinder In the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, tieflings are commonly known by the colloquial term Hellspawn. Due to limitations in the Open Game License, they are referred to exclusively by this term in the Pathfinder Tales novels. In the empire of Cheliax, tieflings are subjugated and often enslaved, despite the royal house's affiliation with Hell. Some tieflings have a stronger connection to one of the fiendish races, such as the grimspawn, who are descended from daemons, and the pitborn, who are descended from devils. Notable tieflings Livonia Darktongue appears in the book Weapons of Legacy in 2005. In Urban Arcana Tieflings are a playable race in Urban Arcana, which is based on the premise that races from Dungeons and Dragons exist on earth. Most tieflings in Urban Arcana are humans with horns, although more obvious appearances exist. To regular humans who cannot perceive shadow, they appear to be cynical humans‚Äîthe horns are not visible to those unable to perceive shadow. In other media In the PC game Planescape: Torment the player character is joined by Annah, a tiefling fighter/thief with a rat-like tail. In Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn the tiefling bard NPC Haer'Daelis can join the party. In Neverwinter Nights: Hordes of the Underdark, Valen Shadowbreath, a tiefling weapons master, is a recruitable henchman and potential romance option. Arden Swift is a tiefling NPC who plays a minor role in the last act of the campaign. In Neverwinter Nights II, tiefling is a playable race and Neeshka, a female tiefling rogue, can join the party. Tieflings are also a playable race in the online MMORPG Neverwinter, developed by Cryptic Studios. Two variants of Tieflings are among the playable races in Dungeons & Dragons Online. The Brimstone Angels novels by Erin M. Evans, set in the Forgotten Realms, feature the tiefling warlock Farideh as the main character. One of the main characters in the Dungeons & Dragons comic by John Rogers, Tisha Swornheart, is a tiefling warlock. The Pathfinder Tales novels by Dave Gross feature the tiefling Rogue Radovan Virholt as one of the two primary protagonists.

Fall River Daily Evening News (Fall River, Massachusetts). June 5, 1919. p. 12. Holland conducted experiments in a small tunnel in a coal mine in Bruceton, Pennsylvania, in order to determine how to safely and sufficiently vent vehicles' carbon monoxide out of the tunnel and keep the passengers safe. Holland designed four ventilation shafts that would bring of fresh air into the tunnel every minute.

Talat is the leader of the social democratic Republican Turkish Party (, CTP), having previously held this position between 1996 and 2005. He became prime minister in 2004, and subsequently won the presidential election held on 17 April 2005. Talat was inaugurated on 25 April 2005, succeeding retiring leader Rauf Denkta≈ü. He lost the presidential election of 2010 and was replaced by Dervi≈ü Eroƒülu as President. Early life Talat was born in Kyrenia on 6 July 1952. Completing his secondary education in Cyprus, Talat graduated from Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department of the Middle East Technical University (METU) in Ankara, Turkey. Involved in various political activities since he was a university student, Talat continued after he returned to Cyprus, and played an important role in the establishment of Turkish Cypriot trade unions and the Turkish Cypriot Students' Youth Federation (KOGEF), becoming the first chairman of its executive board. He also participated in the youth movement of the Republican Turkish Party, and served in various committees and organs of the CTP for many years. He served as the party secretary for Education. Political career= Early political career and party leadership  Talat joined the CTP in 1973 and soon rose to the party leadership. He worked as a refrigerator repairman during this time. He was a senior figure in the party when the independence of Northern Cyprus was declared in 1983. The CTP had opposed the creation of an independent state in the north previously, distributing anti-independence pamphlets days before the declaration. However, according to Talat, the party had been threatened by Denkta≈ü to prevent them from voting against the declaration. Talat was one of those against voting for in the internal party debate, but the party leadership narrowly decided to vote for independence. Talat later controversially stated that he had cried after this meeting. Talat was the Minister of Education and Culture in the first coalition government formed by the CTP-Democratic Party (DP) Alliance after the general elections of December 1993. He undertook the same post in the second DP-CTP coalition government, and became the Minister of State and Deputy Prime Minister in the third DP-CTP coalition government. Talat was elected as the leader of the CTP on 14 January 1996, succeeding √ñzker √ñzg√ºr. After being elected to the TRNC parliament on 14 December 2003, Talat formed another CTP-DP coalition government on 13 January 2004, at the behest of the then-TRNC President Rauf Denkta≈ü, when the incumbent Prime minister Dervi≈ü Eroƒülu was unable to do so.  Presidency  Talat meets with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Washington, D.C. on 15 April 2009. Winning a victory in the 20 February 2005 general elections, Talat formed the second CTP-DP coalition, serving as Prime Minister until his election as the second TRNC President on 17 April 2005, when he asked CTP Deputy Leader Ferdi Sabit Soyer to form a new government. As part of his cabinet, he appointed Ra≈üit Pertev as Chief Negotiator for the United Nations Peace Talks. During the 2004 referendum on the Annan Plan to extinguish the Republic of Cyprus through the formation of a loose confederation along ethnic division in advance of its entry to the European Union, Talat promoted a 'Yes' vote among Turkish Cypriots and the plan received overwhelming endorsement north of the Green Line. However, Tassos Papadopoulos, the then President of the Republic of Cyprus, opposed the plan and the Greek Cypriot community rejected it by a large majority opting for an as yet undefined constitution along the EU norms principles such as universal suffrage. As a consequence, the plan was dropped, but the EU declared it would seek to implement trade concessions and other measures designed to alleviate the isolation of Northern Cyprus as a reward for the Turkish Cypriot referendum result. Talat remained publicly committed to reunification. However the pro-solutionist side and Mehmet Al Talat lost momentum, because of the ongoing embargo and isolation, despite promises from the European Union of easing them, which did not occur, and as a result the Turkish Cypriot electorate became frustrated. This led ultimately to the pro- independence side winning the general elections in 2009 and its candidate, former Prime Minister Dervi≈ü Eroƒülu winning the presidential elections in 2010. Although his side and he himself disagrees with and opposes re- unification with the Republic of Cyprus, and favours the unity of and close relations between northern Cyprus and Turkey and supports the independence of the former, he nevertheless is negotiating with the Greek Cypriot side towards a settlement for reunification, to establish a bi-communal, bi-zonal federation in Cyprus, based on the political equality of the two communities, single sovereignty, single citizenship and international identity.  Return to politics  On 14 June 2015, Talat won the congress of the CTP and became the leader of the party again. Under his leadership, the Yorgancƒ±oƒülu cabinet resigned and was replaced by a cabinet headed by √ñmer Kalyoncu, in a grand coalition with the National Unity Party (UBP). Talat was sometimes dubbed as the \\"shadow leader\\" of the cabinet, though he refused this designation. The government fell due to the UBP's withdrawal after friction with Turkey on the economic protocol to be signed between the two states and the question of the management of the Northern Cyprus Water Supply Project. Talat then became the leader of the main opposition as UBP and DP formed a government. On 22 May 2016, he announced that he would not be a candidate for the party's leadership in the next congress, due in November 2016.  Personal life  Mehmet Ali Talat is married to Oya Talat, a chemist and women's rights activist. The couple got married on 29 October 1978. They have a daughter and a son.

He was best known for his character in Televisa's 1970s television show El Chavo del Ocho. Aguirre also participated in another well known television show of the era, El Chapul√≠n Colorado, albeit less frequently. Life and education Rub√©n Aguirre was born in Santa Anita in Saltillo, Coahuila. In his book Despu√©s de Usted (After You, a common phrase used by his character Professor Jirafales), published in February 2015, he wrote about the difficulty of finding higher education institutions in Mexico during the mid 1950s, since there were very few schools. This is why in his late teenage years, he moved to Ciudad Ju√°rez, Chihuahua, to study in one of the most renowned universities of that time, the Escuela Superior de Agricultura \\"Hermanos Escobar\\", where he studied Agricultural Engineering. Once in Ju√°rez, he would regularly cross into the United States, since according to his memoir, \\"it was so easy to cross the border back then, I remember I would put on my college jacket on and since the gringo would see that you were a student, he would let you through\\". Rub√©n Aguirre worked many times as a gardener in El Paso to make ends meet. It was in Ju√°rez, as well, where he began his career in the media as an unofficial radio host and bullfighting commentator. His passion to become a radio announcer was so big that he paused his college education to travel to Mexico City and get his radio license. He returned to Ju√°rez and began working as a radio host; he married his wife Consuelo de los Reyes, who he met at a bullfight, finished his degree in Agricultural Engineering with a minor in Mechanized Systems and some time after he moved to Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, where he began his acting career and met Roberto G√≥mez Bola√±os. Work When he first began looking for acting work, he was told that at 6'5\\", he was too tall. Nevertheless, despite his height, he was able to begin his acting career in Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, working with a character named Pipo, a famous clown. His acting caught the eye of Mexican producer Roberto G√≥mez Bola√±os who asked him to work with him in Mexico City. Aguirre went on to Mexico City where he worked on several television scripts with G√≥mez Bola√±os, creator and main star of both El Chavo and El Chapul√≠n Colorado. Aguirre garnered fame across Latin America when both El Chavo and El Chapul√≠n Colorado became major international hits. The group of actors that comprised the casts of both shows toured often, and sometimes they would venture out on their own. Aguirre was not the exception, visiting such places as Puerto Rico, Venezuela and Brazil many times. Chespirito owned the rights to El Chavo and El Chapul√≠n Colorado. After Aguirre's participation in both shows was over, he moved to Argentina and opened a circus there. Chespirito had no copyrights in Argentina, and Aguirre was able to name his circus El Circo del Profesor Jirafales. Death Aguirre died on June 17, 2016, from pneumonia complications at his home in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico at the age of 82, 2 days after his birthday.

The meter communicates to its collection point using 900 MHz mesh network topology. Automatic meter reading (AMR) is the technology of automatically collecting consumption, diagnostic, and status data from water meter or energy metering devices (gas, electric) and transferring that data to a central database for billing, troubleshooting, and analyzing. This technology mainly saves utility providers the expense of periodic trips to each physical location to read a meter. Another advantage is that billing can be based on near real-time consumption rather than on estimates based on past or predicted consumption. This timely information coupled with analysis can help both utility providers and customers better control the use and production of electric energy, gas usage, or water consumption. AMR technologies include handheld, mobile and network technologies based on telephony platforms (wired and wireless), radio frequency (RF), or powerline transmission. Technologies= Touch technology With touch-based AMR, a meter reader carries a handheld computer or data collection device with a wand or probe. The device automatically collects the readings from a meter by touching or placing the read probe in close proximity to a reading coil enclosed in the touchpad. When a button is pressed, the probe sends an interrogate signal to the touch module to collect the meter reading. The software in the device matches the serial number to one in the route database, and saves the meter reading for later download to a billing or data collection computer. Since the meter reader still has to go to the site of the meter, this is sometimes referred to as \\"on-site\\" AMR. Another form of contact reader uses a standardized infrared port to transmit data. Protocols are standardized between manufacturers by such documents as ANSI C12.18 or IEC 61107.  AMR Hosting  AMR Hosting is a back-office solution which allows a user to track their electricity, water, or gas consumption over the Internet. All data is collected in near real-time, and is stored in a database by data acquisition software. The user can view the data via a web application, and can analyze the data using various online analysis tools such as charting load profiles, analyzing tariff components, and verify their utility bill.  Radio frequency network Radio frequency based AMR can take many forms. The more common ones are handheld, mobile, satellite and fixed network solutions. There are both two-way RF systems and one-way RF systems in use that use both licensed and unlicensed RF bands. In a two-way or \\"wake up\\" system, a radio signal is normally sent to an AMR meter's unique serial number, instructing its transceiver to power-up and transmit its data. The meter transceiver and the reading transceiver both send and receive radio signals. In a one-way ‚Äúbubble-up‚Äù or continuous broadcast type system, the meter transmits continuously and data is sent every few seconds. This means the reading device can be a receiver only, and the meter a transmitter only. Data travels only from the meter transmitter to the reading receiver. There are also hybrid systems that combine one-way and two-way techniques, using one-way communication for reading and two-way communication for programming functions. RF-based meter reading usually eliminates the need for the meter reader to enter the property or home, or to locate and open an underground meter pit. The utility saves money by increased speed of reading, has less liability from entering private property, and has fewer missed readings from being unable to access the meter. The technology based on RF is not readily accepted everywhere. In several Asian countries, the technology faces a barrier of regulations in place pertaining to use of the radio frequency of any radiated power. For example, in India the radio frequency which is generally in ISM band is not free to use even for low power radio of 10 mW. The majority of manufacturers of electricity meters have radio frequency devices in the frequency band of 433/868 MHz for large scale deployment in European countries. The frequency band of 2.4 GHz can be now used in India for outdoor as well as indoor applications, but few manufacturers have shown products within this frequency band. Initiatives in radio frequency AMR in such countries are being taken up with regulators wherever the cost of licensing outweighs the benefits of AMR. = Handheld = In handheld AMR, a meter reader carries a handheld computer with a built-in or attached receiver/transceiver (radio frequency or touch) to collect meter readings from an AMR capable meter. This is sometimes referred to as \\"walk-by\\" meter reading since the meter reader walks by the locations where meters are installed as they go through their meter reading route. Handheld computers may also be used to manually enter readings without the use of AMR technology as an alternate but this will not support exhaustive data which can be accurately read using the meter reading electronically. = Mobile = Mobile or \\"drive-by\\" meter reading is where a reading device is installed in a vehicle. The meter reader drives the vehicle while the reading device automatically collects the meter readings. Often, for mobile meter reading, the reading equipment includes navigational and mapping features provided by GPS and mapping software. With mobile meter reading, the reader does not normally have to read the meters in any particular route order, but just drives the service area until all meters are read. Components often consist of a laptop or proprietary computer, software, RF receiver/transceiver, and external vehicle antennas. = Satellite = Transmitters for data collection satellites can be installed in the field next to existing meters. The satellite AMR devices communicates with the meter for readings, and then sends those readings over a fixed or mobile satellite network. This network requires a clear view to the sky for the satellite transmitter/receiver, but eliminates the need to install fixed towers or send out field technicians, thereby being particularly suited for areas with low geographic meter density. = RF technologies commonly used for AMR = * Narrow Band (single fixed radio frequency) * Spread Spectrum ** Direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) ** Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) There are also meters using AMR with RF technologies such as cellular phone data systems, ZigBee, Bluetooth, Wavenis and others. Some systems operate with U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) licensed frequencies and others under FCC Part 15, which allows use of unlicensed radio frequencies. = Wi-Fi = WiSmart is a versatile platform which can be used by a variety of electrical home appliances in order to provide wireless TCP/IP communication using the 802.11 b/g protocol. Devices such as the Smart Thermostat permit a utility to lower a home's power consumption to help manage power demand. The city of Corpus Christi became one of the first cities in the United States to implement citywide Wi-Fi, which had been free until May 31, 2007, mainly to facilitate AMR after a meter reader was attacked by a dog.EarthLink Dedicates Wi-Fi Network In Corpus Christi Today many meters are designed to transmit using Wi-Fi, even if a Wi-Fi network is not available, and they are read using a drive-by local Wi-Fi hand held receiver. The meters installed in Corpus Christi are not directly Wi-Fi enabled, but rather transmit narrow-band burst telemetry on the 460 MHz band. This narrow-band signal has much greater range than Wi-Fi, so the number of receivers required for the project are far fewer. Special receiver stations then decode the narrow-band signals and resend the data via Wi-Fi. Most of the automated utility meters installed in the Corpus Christi area are battery powered. Wi-Fi technology is unsuitable for long-term battery-powered operation.  Power line communication  PLC is a method where electronic data is transmitted over power lines back to the substation, then relayed to a central computer in the utility's main office. This would be considered a type of fixed network system‚Äîthe network being the distribution network which the utility has built and maintains to deliver electric power. Such systems are primarily used for electric meter reading. Some providers have interfaced gas and water meters to feed into a PLC type system.  Brief history In 1972, Theodore George ‚ÄúTed‚Äù Paraskevakos, while working with Boeing in Huntsville, Alabama, developed a sensor monitoring system which used digital transmission for security, fire and medical alarm systems as well as meter reading capabilities for all utilities. This technology was a spin-off of the automatic telephone line identification system, now known as Caller ID. In 1974, Mr. Paraskevakos was awarded a U.S. patent for this technology. (Sensor Monitoring Device) In 1977, he launched Metretek, Inc., which developed and produced the first fully automated, commercially available remote meter reading and load management system. Since this system was developed pre-Internet, Metretek utilized the IBM series 1 mini-computer. For this approach, Mr. Paraskevakos and Metretek were awarded multiple patents. and and Canadian Patent # 1,155,243 (Apparatus and Method for Remote Sensor Monitoring, Metering and Control) The primary driver for the automation of meter reading is not to reduce labor costs, but to obtain data that is difficult to obtain. As an example, many water meters are installed in locations that require the utility to schedule an appointment with the homeowner in order to obtain access to the meter. In many areas, consumers have demanded that their monthly water bill be based on an actual reading, instead of (for example) an estimated monthly usage based on just one actual meter reading made every 12 months. Early AMR systems often consisted of walk-by and drive-by AMR for residential customers, and telephone-based AMR for commercial or industrial customers. What was once a need for monthly data became a need for daily and even hourly readings of the meters. Consequently, the sales of drive-by and telephone AMR has declined in the US, while sales of fixed networks has increased. The US Energy Policy Act of 2005 asks that electric utility regulators consider the support for a \\"...time-based rate schedule (to) enable the electric consumer to manage energy use and cost through advanced metering and communications technology.\\" US Congress, Energy Policy Act of 2005 The trend now is to consider the use of advanced meters as part of an Advanced Metering Infrastructure.The First Commercially Available Remote Meter Reading and Load Management System - Metretek, Inc. (1978)  Advanced AMR and AMI  Originally AMR devices just collected meter readings electronically and matched them with accounts. As technology has advanced, additional data could then be captured, stored, and transmitted to the main computer, and often the metering devices could be controlled remotely. This can include events alarms such as tamper, leak detection, low battery, or reverse flow. Many AMR devices can also capture interval data, and log meter events. The logged data can be used to collect or control time of use or rate of use data that can be used for water or energy usage profiling, time of use billing, demand forecasting, demand response, rate of flow recording, leak detection, flow monitoring, water and energy conservation enforcement, remote shutoff, etc. Advanced metering infrastructure, or AMI is the new term coined to represent the networking technology of fixed network meter systems that go beyond AMR into remote utility management. The meters in an AMI system are often referred to as smart meters, since they often can use collected data based on programmed logic. The Automatic Meter Reading Association (AMRA) endorses the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) resolution to eliminate regulatory barriers to the broad implementation of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI). The resolution, passed in February 2007,Resolution to Remove Regulatory Barriers To the Broad Implementation of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (from NARUC Committee on Energy Resources and the Environment Resolutions of 2007-02-21) acknowledged the role of AMI in supporting the implementation of dynamic pricing and the resulting benefits to consumers. The resolution further identified the value of AMI in achieving significant utility operational cost savings in the areas of outage management, revenue protection and asset management. The resolution also called for AMI business case analysis to identify cost-effective deployment strategies, endorsed timely cost recovery for prudently incurred AMI expenditures and made additional recommendations on rate making and tax treatment of such investments. Benefits of advanced metering Advanced metering systems can provide benefits for utilities, retail providers and customers. Benefits will be recognized by the utilities with increased efficiencies, outage detection, tamper notification and reduced labor cost as a result of automating reads, connections and disconnects. Retail providers will be able to offer new innovative products in addition to customizing packages for their customers. In addition, with the meter data being readily available, more flexible billing cycles would be available to their customers instead of following the standard utility read cycles. With timely usage information available to the customer, benefits will be seen through opportunities to manage their energy consumption and change from one REP to another with actual meter data. Because of these benefits, many utilities are moving towards implementing some types of AMR solutions. In many cases, smart metering is required by law (e.g. Pennsylvania's Act 129 (2008)). The benefits of smart metering for the utility. * Accurate meter reading, no more estimates * Improved billing * Accurate profile classes and measurement classes, true costs applied * Improved security and tamper detection for equipment * Energy management through profile data graphs * Less financial burden correcting mistakes * Less accrued expenditure * Transparency of \\"cost to read\\" metering * Improved procurement power though more accurate data -- \\"de-risking\\" price * In cases of shortages, utility will be able to manage/allocate supply. The benefits of smart metering for the customer. * Improved billing and tracking of usage. Disadvantages of advanced metering * Risk of loss of privacy -- details of use reveal information about user activitiesPrivacy on the Smart Grid * Greater potential for monitoring by other/unauthorized third parties * Potentially reduced reliability (more complicated meters, more potential for interference by third parties) * Increased security risks from network or remote access  Notable deployments  Construction practices, weather, and the need for information drive utilities in different parts of the world towards AMR at different rates. In the US, there have been significant fixed network deployments of both RF based and PLC based technologies. PPL 1.3 million residential and commercial electric meters Some countries have either deployed or plan to deploy Sweden, (Vattenfall) 850k meters AMR systems throughout the entire country. = SPAR = By using a combination of AMR and energy analytics reports, SPAR were able to reduce energy consumption by 20%. = Australia = AMI in Australia has grown from both government policy which sought to rectify observed market inefficiencies, and distribution businesses who looked to gain operational efficiencies. In July 2008, there was a mandated program being planned in Victoria for the deployment of 2.6 million meters over a 4-year period. The anticipated peak installation rate of AMI meters was 5,000 per day across Victoria. The program governance was provided by an industry steering committee. In 2009 the Victorian Auditor General undertook a review of the program and found that there were \\"significant inadequacies\\" in advice to Government and that project governance \\"has not been appropriate\\".http://www.itnews.com.au/News/160398,auditor-general-slams- victorian-smart-meters.aspx The Victorian government subsequently announced a moratorium of the program *Public Utility Commission of Texas Report 2006 *Pennsylvania, (Exelon-PECO) 2.2 million meters deployed *Missouri, (Ameren) 1.7 million meters deployed.

Until the Boeing 747-8F, the An-124 was, for thirty years, the world's heaviest gross weight production cargo airplane and second heaviest operating cargo aircraft, behind the one-off Antonov An-225 Mriya (a greatly enlarged design based on the An-124). The An-124 remains the largest military transport aircraft in current service. The lead designer of the An-124 (and the An-225) was Viktor Tolmachev. During development it was known as Izdeliye 400 (Product #400) in house, and An-40 in the West. First flown in 1982, civil certification was issued on 30 December 1992.E. Gordon, Antonov's Heavy Transports, Midland Publishing. In July 2013, 26 An-124s were in commercial service with 10 on order. In August 2014, it was reported that plans to resume joint production of the Antonov An-124 had been shelved due to the ongoing political tensions between Russia and Ukraine. The sole remaining production facility is Russia's Aviastar-SP in Ulyanovsk. The various operators of the An-124 are in discussions with respect to the continuing airworthiness certification of the individual An-124 planes. The original designer of the An-124 is responsible for managing the certification process for its own products, but the Russia-Ukraine conflicts are making this process difficult to manage. Development During the 1970s, the Military Transport Aviation Command (Komandovaniye voyenno-transportnoy aviatsii or VTA) arm of the Soviet Air Forces had a shortfall in strategic heavy airlift capacity. Its largest planes consisted of about 50 Antonov An-22 turboprops, which were used heavily for tactical roles.

Sir John Chichester sat as a Member of Parliament and was High Sheriff of Devon in 1557. One of his sons, Sir Arthur Chichester, was Lord Deputy of Ireland from 1604 to 1614. In 1613, he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Chichester, of Belfast in County Antrim. He died childless in 1625 when the barony became extinct. However, in the same year the Chichester title was revived in favour of his younger brother, Edward Chichester, who was made Baron Chichester, of Belfast in the County of Antrim, and Viscount Chichester, of Carrickfergus in County Antrim. Both titles are in the Peerage of Ireland. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Arthur Chichester. A distinguished soldier, he was created Earl of Donegall in the Peerage of Ireland in 1647 (one year before he succeeded his father), with remainder to the heirs male of his father. He died without male issue and was succeeded (in the earldom according to the special remainder) by his nephew Arthur Chichester, the second Earl. He was the eldest son of Lieutenant-Colonel John Chichester, second son of the first Viscount. Lord Donegall had previously represented Donegal County in the Irish House of Commons. His eldest son, the third Earl, was a Major-General in the Spanish army and fought in the War of the Spanish Succession. He was killed in action in 1706. His eldest son, the fourth Earl, died childless and was succeeded by his nephew, the fifth Earl. He was the son of the Hon. John Chichester, younger son of the third Earl. Lord Donegall was created Baron Fisherwick, of Fisherwick in the County of Stafford, in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1790, and one year later he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Belfast and Marquess of Donegall in the Peerage of Ireland. His grandson, the third Marquess, served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard under Lord John Russell between 1848 and 1852. In 1841, three years before he succeeded his father in the marquessate, he was created Baron Ennishowen and Carrickfergus, of Ennishowen in the County of Donegal and of Carrickfergus in the County of Antrim, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Both his sons predeceased him and on his death in 1883 the barony of 1841 became extinct. He was succeeded in his other titles by his younger brother, the fourth Marquess. On the death of his grandson, the sixth Marquess, in 1975, the line of the second Marquess failed. The sixth Marquess was succeeded by his kinsman, the fifth Baron Templemore (see below), who became the seventh Marquess. From 1975 until 1999, when most hereditary seats were abolished with the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999, the Marquess sat in the House of Lords as Baron Fisherwick in the Peerage of Great Britain. , the titles are held by the latter's son, the eighth Marquess, who succeeded in 2007. The county in Ulster from which the title is derived is now spelled Donegal. Several locations in Belfast are named after the family, such as Donegall Square, Donegall Place, Donegall Road, Donegall Pass, Donegall Quay, Chichester Street, Arthur Street, Arthur Square, and Chichester Park. Chichester family Several other members of the Chichester family have also gained distinction. John Chichester, grandson of Sir John Chichester, brother of the first Baron Chichester and the first Viscount Chichester, was created a baronet in 1641 (see Chichester baronets). John Chichester, second son of the first Viscount and father of the second Earl, represented Dungannon in the Irish House of Commons. For the branch of the family founded by John Chichester's younger son and namesake, John Chichester, see Baron O'Neill and Baron Rathcavan. Arthur Chichester, eldest son of Lord Spencer Chichester, second son of the first Marquess, was created Baron Templemore in 1831. Lord Arthur Chichester, fourth son of the second Marquess, and Lord John Chichester, sixth son of the second Marquess, both represented Belfast in Parliament. Robert Chichester, eldest son of Lord Adolphus Chichester, youngest son of the fourth Marquess, briefly represented Londonderry South in Parliament. His wife Dehra was also a politician while their daughter, Marion Caroline Dehra, was the mother of The Baron Moyola, who served briefly as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, and the politician Sir Robin Chichester-Clark and of the gardening writer and television presenter Penelope Hobhouse. Family seats=Ulster The caput, or family seat, has been in several locations over the centuries, usually in the east of Ulster. Joymount House was built for The 1st Baron Chichester in the 1610s in Carrickfergus in the east of County Antrim, probably being completed in 1618.

Joymount, along with the Plantation-era Belfast Castle, were the original two principal residences of the Chichester family in Ireland. Lord Chichester also maintained Chichester House, located on the Hoggen Green (now College Green), as his residence on what was then the eastern edge of Dublin. Joymount House was probably demolished in the early eighteenth-century, while Parliament House was built on the site of Chichester House in Dublin in the early 1730s. In the early to mid-nineteenth-century, the family seats were: Donegall House, a large townhouse on the corner of what is now Donegall Place and Donegall Square in central BelfastW. A.

Both these residences were later demolished, with Ormeau House probably being demolished around 1867.Norman Weatherall and George Templeton, South Belfast: History and Guide, p. 89. Nonsuch Publishing, Dublin, 2008. The 2nd Marquess of Donegall, again during the early to mid-nineteenth-century, also maintained Fisherwick Lodge, a hunting 'lodge' near Doagh (pronounced 'D'oak') in County Antrim, on the family's country estate there.W. A. Maguire, Living like a Lord: The Second Marquis of Donegall, 1769-1844, pp. 28, 73. Ulster Historical Foundation, Belfast, 2002. Originally published by Appletree Press and The Ulster Society for Irish Historical Studies, Belfast, 1984. Later in the nineteenth-century, Belfast Castle, on the lower slopes of Cave Hill in North Belfast, was purpose-designed and built for The 3rd Marquess of Donegall as the main residence of the family. This new Belfast Castle was inherited by The 8th Earl of Shaftesbury and his wife in October 1883, thus passing out of the ownership of the Chichester family. Lord Shaftesbury had married the daughter of the third Marquess. County Wexford From October 1953 until about 1996, Dunbrody House, formerly the seat of the Barons Templemore near Arthurstown in the south-west of County Wexford, was the family seat of The 7th Marquess of Donegall. From October 1953 until May 1975, the seventh Marquess was known as The 5th Baron Templemore. Arthurstown was named for The 1st Earl of Donegall. The house was sold by the seventh Marquess to chef Kevin Dundon, who converted it to a luxury hotel and restaurant in 1997. What remains of the Dunbrody Estate is, however, still in the ownership of the current head of the family, The 8th Marquess of Donegall, whose present family seat is the much smaller Dunbrody Park within the estate grounds.

Adel is under indictment by the United StatesCopy of indictment USA v. Usama bin Laden et al., Center for Nonproliferation Studies, Monterey Institute of International Studies for his part in the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Kenya. According to the indictment, Adel is a member of the majlis al shura of al-Qaeda and a member of its military committee. He has provided military and intelligence training to members of al-Qaeda and Egyptian Islamic Jihad in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Sudan, and to anti-UN Somali tribes. It is possible that his trainees included the Somalis of the first Battle of Mogadishu. He established the al-Qaeda training facility at Ras Kamboni in Somalia near the Kenyan border. Adel was accused of being involved with Egyptian Islamic Jihad and attempting to overthrow the Egyptian government in 1987. After the charges were dismissed, he left the country in 1988 to join the mujahideen in repelling the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. He is believed to have traveled to southern Lebanon along with Abu Talha al- Sudani, Sayful Islam al-Masri, Abu Ja\`far al-Masri, and Abu Salim al-Masri, where he trained alongside Hezbollah Al-Hejaz. In Khartoum, Sudan, Adel taught recruited militants how to handle explosives.Jamal al-Fadl testimony, United States vs. Osama bin Laden et al., trial transcript, Day 2, February 6, 2001. Along with Saeed al-Masri and Mahfouz Ould al-Walid, he is believed to have opposed the September 11 attacks two months prior to their execution.9/11 Commission, p. 251 Early life The Egyptian military has yet to release his files, but it is believed that Saif al-Adel (which translates to \\"Sword of Justice\\") is a pseudonym. His real name is thought to be Mohammed Salah al-Din Zaidan. He was born around 1960 (The FBI claims 11 April). He joined the Egyptian Military around 1976 and became a Colonel in the Special Forces as an Explosives expert, possibly being trained in the Soviet Union. He fled Egypt in 1988 and reportedly made his way to Afghanistan, joining the relatively small but well funded (and mainly Egyptian and Saudi) Maktab al-Khidamat, which was the forerunner to al-Qaeda. He became a trainer in Explosives to new recruits, and would stay in Afghanistan after the war to train members of the newly formed Taliban. The leader of the Somali militant Islamist group al- Shabaab, Moktar Ali Zubeyr, has said that Saif al-Adel and Yusef al-Ayeri played an important role in the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu by providing training and participating in the battle directly. Adel would later join Bin Laden in Sudan after 1994. Militant connections= Embassy bombings  Several months before the 1998 embassy bombings, Adel was helping Osama bin Laden move his followers from Najim Jihad to Tarnak Farms. The group had begrudgingly agreed to care for the troublesome Canadian 16-year-old, Abdurahman Khadr, since his father was away and his mother couldn't control his drinking, smoking and violent outbursts. However, while they were in Kabul, bin Laden asked Adel to take Abdurahman to the bus station and send him back to his family's home. In approximately 2000, Adel was living in the Karte Parwan district of Kabul. On the local walkie-talkie communications in the city, he was identified as #1. On 9 September 2001, Adel was approached by Feroz Ali Abbasi, who said he was so impressed by the killing of Ahmed Shah Massoud that he wanted to volunteer for something similar. In early November 2001, the Taliban government announced they were bestowing official Afghan citizenship on Adel, as well as Bin Laden, Zawahiri, Mohammed Atef, and Shaykh Asim Abdulrahman.The Hindu, \\"Taliban grants Osama citizenship\\", November 9, 2001 During the American bombardment of Kandahar, Adel was present and witnessed the deaths of Abu-Ali al-Yafi'i and his wife, Abu-Usamah al-Ta'zi with his wife and two children, the wife of Rayyan al-Ta'zi, the wife of Abu-Usamah al- Kini, and the wife of Al-Barra al-Hijazi who was arrested in Morocco before the Casablanca bombings. On 18 November, Adel was working with Abu-Muhammad al-Abyad, Abd-al-Rahman al-Masri, and Abu-Usamah al-Filastini, Abu-Husayn al- Masri and Faruq al-Suri; all of whom were staying in his empty house with him at night. In the early morning hours of 19 November, he woke them up just minutes before the al-Wafa charity building was bombed. Phoning friends in the area, he learned that Abdul Wahid had been killed in the explosion. He later learned that Asim al-Yamani, from Al Farouq training camp, and the elderly Abu-Abd-al-Rahman Al-Abiy had run to the charity's headquarters and begun rescuing survivors and pulling out the dead bodies. The pair agreed the area was not safe, and sent their women to the smaller villages, while they used their two cars to try and pack up their house's contents. An American jet bombed the pair, killing al-Yamani and wounding al-Abiy. As it was the third day of Ramadan, the group in Adel's house began to prepare and eat Suhoor, but were interrupted by a cruise missile striking 100 metres away, destroying an empty house belonging to an Afghan Arab family, and a Taliban barracks. They gathered their belongings and quickly left, fearing another strike. Adel went to the hospital, where he visited the wounded al-Abiy, and arranged for him to be transferred to a hospital in Pakistan. After Adel was told by Abu Ali al- Suri that the American aircraft had machinegunned women leaving the city on the road to Banjway, Adel said that he would send aid. A convoy of 4‚Äì6 Corolla Fielders set out to Banjway, followed closely by American helicopters. The Americans attacked the lead vehicle, killing Abu-Ali al-Yafi'i, his wife, four women, and two children, and the second vehicle, killing Suraqah al-Yamani and Hamzah al-Suri. Abu-Ali al-Maliki quickly veered off the road with the third vehicle, turning off his headlights, and drove into the mountains, escaping the attack. Since al-Qaeda's military chief Mohammed Atef was killed in 2001, journalists reported that Adel was likely his successor in that role.  Pearl kidnapping  Since 2011, he has been connected with the kidnapping of the journalist Daniel Pearl in 2002.  2003 Riyadh bombing  Al-Adel and Saad bin Laden were implicated in the 12 May 2003 suicide bombing in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. In May 2003, then-State Department official Ryan Crocker provided information on the upcoming attack to Iranian officials, who apparently took no action. However, according to Saad's family and an interrogation of former al-Qaeda spokesman Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, Saad and al- Adel were being held prisoner in Iran when the attack took place.http://kronosadvisory.com/Kronos_US_v_Sulaiman_Abu_Ghayth_Statement.1.pdf In 2004, he published a \\"terrorist manual\\" entitled The Base of the Vanguard, an Arabic pun on the phrases al-Qaeda (\\"the base\\") and the Vanguards of Conquest. Al-Adel was a key source in a 2005 book on al-Qaeda's global strategy by the journalist Fouad Hussein. Al-Adel is a leader of al-Qaeda in Iran, according to American security expert Seth Jones. Current location Adel has been on the FBI's list of Most Wanted Terrorists since its inception in 2001. The State Department's Rewards for Justice Program is offering up to US$10 million for information on his location.Saif al-Adel wanted poster , Rewards for Justice, US Department of State In late 2001, Adel fled Afghanistan to Iran and was detained under house arrest in Tehran. Later reports indicated that he was released by Iran in March 2010 in exchange for the release of Heshmatollah Attarzadeh, an Iranian diplomat kidnapped in November 2008, and made his way to northern Pakistan.Al-Qaida finds safe haven in Iran, NBC News, 24 June 2005 Although Mahfouz Ould al-Walid was reported killed in a January 2002 American airstrike, it was later revealed that he fled to Iran with Adel.Bower, Amanda. TIME, \\"More arrests, new threats in fight against terror\\", September 9, 2002 In October 2010, Der Spiegel reported that Adel was in the Waziristan region in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas between Northwest Frontier Province, Pakistan and Afghanistan. In July 2011, it was reported that Adel returned to Iran. However, according to Ghaith, al-Adel never left Iran and was still under house arrest when Ghaith was captured in 2013. On 20 September 2015, Al Arabiya reported that al-Adel and four other captives were part of a prisoner exchange Iranian authorities made with Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula in Yemen. On 16 March 2016, a Twitter account affiliated with al-Qaeda implicated al-Adel as having been sent to aid against the Russian intervention in the Syrian Civil War. A similar report also placed al-Adel as having been sent to Syria as an emissary on behalf of al-Qaeda emir Ayman al-Zawahiri. However, Long War Journal claims that al-Adel is in Iran. Real name It was originally believed that his real name is Mohammed Ibrahim Makkawi. However, on 29 February 2012, Egyptian authorities arrested a man by that name at Cairo International Airport and it was discovered that he was not Adel. Adel's real name is instead Mohammed Salah al-Din Zaidan. The FBI continues to list Makkawi and not Zaidan on its Most Wanted poster. Writings Saif al-Adel in the profile of the Combating Terrorism Center In February 2006, the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point published a number of declassified documents from the Harmony database, some of which are known or believed to have been written by Saif al-Adel. One is a letter signed \\"Omar al-Sumali, previously known as Saif al-Adel\\", about the author's activities in southern Somalia during UNOSOM II (1993‚Äì1995). It identifies Ras Kamboni as a suitable site for an al-Qaeda base. It mentions an accomplice of Adel called \\"Mukhtar\\". In a letter\\"Adel letter to Mukhtar\\", handwritten Arabic original, at USMA from \\"'Abd-al-Halim Adl'\\" to \\"'Mukhtar'\\", dated 13 June 2002, the author strongly criticises the leadership of Osama bin Laden, blaming the defeats of the preceding six months for al-Qaeda on bin Laden's recklessness and unwillingness to listen to advice: From the following section, the 2002 addressee, \\"'Mukhtar'\\" appears to be Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the commander of the September 11, 2001 attacks: > The East Asia, Europe, America, Horn of Africa, Yemen, Gulf, and Morocco > groups have fallen, and Pakistan has almost been drowned in one push. I, not > to mention the other individuals who have also moved and fallen, have often > advised on this matter. Regrettably, my brother, if you look back, you will > find that you are the person solely responsible for all this because you > undertook the mission, and during six months, we only lost what we built in > years. In 2004, Adel was alleged to be the author of The Al-Battar Military Camp, a manual that advised prospective militants about how to strike easy targets.National Post, \\"Al-Qaeda Urges Attacks On Canadians: Instructions In Manual: Advises Hitting 'Easy Targets That Are Not Protected'\\", March 31, 2004 On 11 March 2005, Al-Quds Al-Arabi published extracts from Adel's document, \\"Al Quaeda's Strategy to the Year 2020\\". In March 2007, the Pentagon posted on the Internet a transcriptVerbatim Transcript of Combatant Status Review Tribunal Hearing for ISN 10013, US Department of Defense of part of the hearing into the combatant status of detainee Ramzi bin al-Shibh. Some of the evidence against bin al-Shibh came from a diary of Saif al-Adel found in Saudi Arabia in 2004. The CSRT document described al-Adel by the following: > Sayf al-Adel is a senior al Qaida military commander with a long-term > relationship with Usama bin Laden. Sayf al-Adel's role in the organization > has been as a trainer, military leader, and key member of Usama bin Laden's > security detail. > The diary of Sayf al-Adel was recovered during a raid in Saudi Arabia in > 2004. The diary details the Detainee's involvement in the 11 September 2001 > terrorist plot and subsequent attack. In addition, the paragraph continued: > The Detainee is listed as a \\"highly professional jihadist\\" along with \\"9/11 > hijackers\\", Mohammed Atta and Ziad Jarrah. The diary states that the three > were briefed on an operation involving aircraft by Abu Hafs, a senior al > Qaida planner. In December 2010, Adel allegedly sent a series of five lettersBrown, Valid (10 February 2011). \\"Al-Qa‚Äôida Revisions: The Five Letters of Sayf al-‚ÄòAdl\\" Jihadica.Hamid, Mustafa \\"ÿßŸÑŸÇÿßÿπÿØÿ© - ÿ±ÿ≥ÿßŸÑÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÇÿßÿπÿØÿ© ÿ•ŸÑŸâ ŸÖŸàŸÇÿπ ŸÖÿßŸÅÿß ÿßŸÑÿ≥Ÿäÿßÿ≥Ÿâ ÿ®ŸÇŸÑŸÖ\\" to Abu Walid al Masri, then under house arrest in Iran.

Al Masri posted the letters on the Internet in December 2010.

In the eulogy he criticized the Islamic State and described them as having \\"twisted\\" and \\"perverted\\" thoughts.

The western coast of the peninsula is home to the Keiy≈ç Industrial Zone, which ranges from Urayasu on the border of Tokyo in the northwest of the peninsula to Futtsu to the south. The Tokyo Bay Aqua- Line, a bridge-tunnel across Tokyo Bay, connects Kisarazu with the city of Kawasaki in Kanagawa Prefecture. The northeast of the peninsula is home to Suigo-Tsukuba Quasi-National Park, which spans across both Ibaraki and Chiba prefectures, and much of the remainder of the eastern coast of the peninsula is designated as Minami B≈çs≈ç Quasi-National Park. Etymology The peninsula gets its name and kanji from the former provinces that were located there: Awa (ÂÆâÊàø), Kazusa (‰∏äÁ∑è) and Shim≈çsa (‰∏ãÁ∑è).

He served as the Israeli ambassador to Egypt, Romania, and Sweden. Education and work experience Mazel was born in Bnei Brak, and served in the IDF from 1956 to 1958. After initial studies in Israel, Mazel studied political science in France, at the Institut d'√âtudes Politiques de Paris (The Parisian Institute for Political Studies). There he met his wife, Michelle, a political scientist and writer. He graduated in 1963, and joined the diplomatic corps of the Israeli Foreign Ministry in 1966, where he served as a researcher at the Foreign Ministry's Institute of Political Research. From 1969 to 1973, he served as First Secretary of the Israeli Embassy in Antananarivo, Madagascar, and then served as an attache at the Israeli Embassy in Paris until 1977, when he returned to Israel to again serve as a researcher in the Institute of Political Research. From 1980 to 1982, he served at the Israeli Embassy in Cairo, during the thaw period between Israel and Egypt that ended with the 1982 Lebanon War. During this period, he also held the post as director of Eastern European division and head of the Egyptian and North African department at the Foreign Ministry. In 1989 he was posted as ambassador to Romania, where he witnessed the Romanian Revolution. In 1992 he was appointed Deputy Director of the Foreign Ministry in charge of African affairs and was instrumental in reestablishing diplomatic relations between Israel and 19 African countries.

Most noted was in 2003, when Mazel appeared in a well known picture with Mr. Helge Fossmo, at that time only known as leader of an ultra- conservative religious group, later imprisoned as the person behind the most spectacular murder case in Sweden's modern history, the Knutby murder. In January 2004, he vandalized the art installation Snow White and The Madness of Truth by Israeli-born Swedish artist Dror Feiler and his wife Gunilla Sk√∂ld Feiler.\\"Ambassad√∂r f√∂rst√∂rde konst\\" Dagens Nyheter\\"Sharon praises 'art vandal' envoy\\" BBC NEWS\\"Art-Loving Israelis Don't Condemn Envoy's Vandalism\\" Los Angeles TimesAP: \\"Swedish museum to remove suicide bomber posters\\" Haaretz The installation took advantage of the reflecting pool at the courtyard of Historiska Museet, that was highlighted and filled with red liquid signifying blood.

Mazel pushed some lightstands into the pool, causing a short-circuit and disabling the light, and then told Feiler that: \\"This is not a work of art.

Further he said to the press that the piece constituted a \\"complete legitimization of genocide, the murder of innocent people, innocent civilians, under the guise of culture\\".

Snow White and the Madness of Truth () was a 2004 item of installation art by Swedish, Israeli- born composer and musician Dror Feiler and his Swedish wife, artist Gunilla Sk√∂ld-Feiler. Feiler and Sk√∂ld-Feiler created the visuals and the music for the artwork together, which was installed in the Swedish History Museum in Stockholm, Sweden. The installation consisted of a long pool of water coloured blood red, upon which floated a small white boat named \\"Sn√∂vit\\" (\\"Snow White\\") carrying a smiling portrait of Hanadi Jaradat, a Palestinian suicide bomber who murdered 22 people. A text was written on the walls, and the sound of Bach's Mein Herze schwimmt im Blut (Cantata 199) played in the background. This piece begins with the words, \\"My heart swims in blood / because the brood of my sins / in God's holy eyes / makes me into a monster\\". According to the artists, the installation was made to \\"call attention to how weak people left alone can be capable of horrible things\\". The artwork became the centre of some controversy when the Israeli ambassador to Sweden, Zvi Mazel, vandalized it claiming that it \\"glorified suicide bombers,\\" and was \\"an expression of hatred for the Israeli people.\\" Some argued that critics failed to understand the artists' central message about tolerance, freedom of thought, and diversity. Reactions to the piece have been compared to reactions to Steve Earle's song \\"John Walker's Blues\\", which appeared on his 2002 album Jerusalem. As scheduled, the artwork was removed from display on February 8, 2004. In 2011 the Feilers created a new installation called \\"Once upon a time in the middle of winter\\" based on the events.DN: Feilers ‚ÄùSn√∂vit‚Äù seglar igen  Controversy  In early 2004 the artwork briefly came to the attention of the international media after it was vandalized on January 16 by Zvi Mazel, the Israeli ambassador to Sweden. Mazel disconnected the electricity powering the installation and tipped one of its lights into the water, causing a short circuit. When Mazel was asked to leave he refused and had to be escorted out by museum security. The entire event was filmed by the museum's security cameras. Mazel later gave contradicting statements about the event. To the Swedish media, he said it was done in the heat of the moment, but to Israeli media he said it was premeditated and that he had planned it even before he saw the artwork. On January 20, Feiler appeared in Nyhetsmorgon on Swedish TV4 and explained that the white boat symbolized truth; and if an individual believed that their views were the absolute embodiment of truth, the end result could well be the pool of blood depicted in the installation. According to Sk√∂ld-Feiler, the name Snow White was chosen simply because in her portrait, Hanadi Jaradat resembled Snow White with her black hair, pale skin and red lips. The installation was a part of the Making Differences exhibition at the Swedish History Museum. On January 18, 2004, Thomas Nordanstad, who is responsible for the exhibition, was attacked by an unidentified man who tried to push Nordanstad down a staircase. Nordanstad had also recently received over 400 e-mails containing various threats. Both Kristian Berg, head of the museum, and the artists also received many threats. The following Sunday, a museum guard had to remove a group of people who were throwing various objects into the water. After the attack on Nordanstad the number of visitors to the museum increased to approximately 1,400 per day, up from roughly the same number per week. According to Swedish Dagens Nyheter journalist Henrik Brors there may have been hidden motives behind Zvi Mazel's act. He speculated that it may have been done in an effort to discredit Sweden and the European Union by depicting them as antisemites, and to have the EU back down from its peace efforts in the Middle East. In the analysis in Dagens Nyheter Brors further speculated that Mazel may have done it to give Israel an excuse for not attending the international anti-genocide conference Stockholm International Forum that was to be held in Stockholm January 26‚Äì28. The situation escalated further when Israel Army Radio incorrectly reported that a \\"pro Israeli\\" film was removed from the exhibition at the request of Syria. Both Thomas Nordanstad and Kristian Berg demonstrated that this allegation was false, as the documentary in question, \\"Map\\" by award-winning Israeli film maker Amit Goren, remained as part of the exhibition. It is believed that the erroneous rumour probably started when the display was moved from Tensta Konsthall due to some internal problems. During the whole time, another work by Goren, the film 119 Bullets + Three‚Äú119 Bullets + Three\\" was also on display. The display of Goren's works is sponsored by the Israeli embassy, and the cultural attache, Lizzie Oved Scheja, stated that the exhibit had their absolute support. The Young Christian Democrats, the youth organisation of the Swedish Christian Democratic party, reported the artwork to the police in hope that action could be taken pursuant to Sweden's strict laws against hate speech. Mazel himself asked in an interview \\"If we Jews say that this offends us, why can't a government remove it?\\".Mazel skonar Persson i ny attack Stockholms Lokaltrafik decided to remove advertising of the Making Differences exhibit that used a picture of Hanadi Jaradat; those posters were a part of C.

He is married to the artist Gunilla Sk√∂ld- Feiler. Early life and career Feiler was born in Tel Aviv in 1951 to Eliezer and Pnina Feiler, and moved with his family to kibbutz Yad Hana in 1967. His father, Eliezer Feiler, was a left-wing activist. In 1978, he and others secretly met with a group of Palestine Liberation Organization representatives in Bucharest while it was still illegal. Eliezer Feiler was tried and eventually sentenced to six months of community service and a 4,000 Israeli lira fine. The fine was paid, but the sentence was never served because, while the legal process was ongoing, the law had changed and it was no longer illegal to meet with members of the PLO. His mother, Pnina Feiler, born 1923, was among the founders of Yad Hana. She worked with mobile health centrals in Palestinian villages in the West Bank that have to travel far to get access to health-care and other services until 2015, when she stopped due to her advanced age.http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.746786 Dror Feiler served as a paratrooper in the Israel Defense Forces. Feiler went abroad in the early 70s to pursue his musical studies in Sweden, where he met his wife. Swedish law at that time did not recognize dual citizenship, and Feilor had to relinquish his Israeli rights in order to become a citizen of Sweden.He studied avant-garde music and its interpretation at the Fylkingen Institut for New Music from 1975 to 1977, musicology at Stockholm University from 1977 to 1978 and composition at the Music Academy of Stockholm from 1978 to 1983. Feiler also plays saxophone in the jazz band Lokomotiv Konkret, and founded the Too Much Too Soon Orchestra. In January 2004 he and Gunilla Sk√∂ld- Feiler made international news with their art installation Snow White and The Madness of Truth, which referred to female suicide bomber Hanadi Jaradat, which was vandalised by the then Israeli ambassador to Sweden Zvi Mazel. The installation consisted of a long pool of water coloured blood red, upon which floated a small white boat named \\"Sn√∂vit\\" (\\"Snow White\\") carrying a portrait of Hanadi Jaradat. She had blown herself up in October 2003 in an attack on Maxim's restaurant in the northern Israeli city of Haifa, killing 21 people and injuring 51. Feiler speaking in 2015 Feiler is now the chairman of the Swedish organization Jews for Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian Peace (JIPF) and the European organization European Jews for a Just Peace (EJJP). He is also a member of the editorial board of the New Colombia News Agency (ANNCOL). He runs the artspace TEGEN 2 in Stockholm together with Gunilla Sk√∂ld Feiler. He is active as a composer of modern music, which includes composition music for symphonic orchestras, opera, chamber music and electro-acoustic music. In April 2008, the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra dropped the world premiere of his composition Halat Hisar (State of Siege), after musicians complained that the music, which includes machine gun sounds, was so loud that it gave them ear problems and headaches. On 31 May 2010 Feiler was aboard one of the ships involved in the Gaza flotilla raid and sustained some minor injuries to the face during the raid. For his participation in the raid, Feiler was banned from entering Israel for 10 years. In July 2010, he flew to Israel together with Swedish MP Mehmet Kaplan, who had also received a 10-year entry ban over his participation in the Gaza flotilla, planning to lodge a complaint with the Israel Police over the flotilla raid. They were refused entry at Ben Gurion Airport and deported.https://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel- denies-entry-to-sweden-mp-and-ex-israeli-who-sailed-on-gaza- flotilla-1.323419?v=895665EA6AC83F76BB3F53FF4B50EF7F In 2011, Feiler was involved in the Freedom Flotilla II, and was among the 15 activists arrested by Israeli authorities aboard the boat Dignit√©. He was subsequently deported from Israel. In the 2010 Swedish general election, Feiler was a candidate for the Left Party () in Stockholm. He obtained 1,784 personal preference votes in Stockholm Municipality (4.51% of the Left Party votes, the second most voted candidate on the list after party chairman Lars Ohly) and 629 personal preference votes in Stockholm County (1.99% of the Left Party votes). Feiler took part in Freedom Flotilla III, aboard the Swedish vessel Marianne. The ship was intercepted by the Israeli Navy on June 29, and Feiler was arrested. Attempts to visit his mother In 2013, Feiler appealed this ban in order to visit his ailing 90-year-old mother. His mother, then 90, had to fly to Sweden to meet up with her son, though bsubsequently, due to health problems, that option ceased to be available. She therefore repeatedly requested the Israeli Ministry for the Interior to lift his ban, without success. In 2018, after Swedish law dropped its ban on dual citizenship, Feilor asked for his citizenship to be restored on the basis of his right to make aliyah and be with his aging mother. No reply was forthcoming. In response to a petition by the family's attorney in December 2019, the director of the Population and Immigration Authority Prof. Shlomo Mor-Yosef in January 2020 conceded permission for a 2 week visit on condition he post a $28,910 bond. This condition was appealed and, in September, a judge extended his visa by a further 2 weeks, since, were he to visit, he would have to stay in quarantine for 14 days, given the Covid19 crisis. That crisis had also affected Feilor's concert schedule, depriving him of adequate financial means to post the bond.Amira Hass, 'Israel to Leftist Expat: Deposit NIS 100k or You Can‚Äôt Visit Your Sick Mother ,' Haaretz 30 September 2020.

Other jurisdictions have similar systems. For example, the investigation of an allegation against a sitting president or attorney general might be handled by a special prosecutor rather than by an ordinary prosecutor who would otherwise be in the position of investigating their own superior. Investigations into other persons connected to the government but not in a position of direct authority over the prosecutor, such as cabinet secretaries or election campaigns, have also been handled by special prosecutors. While the most prominent special prosecutors have been those appointed since the 1870s to investigate presidents and those connected to them, the term can also be used to refer to any prosecutor appointed to avoid a conflict of interest or appearance thereof. The concept originates in state law: \\"state courts have traditionally appointed special prosecutors when the regular government attorney was disqualified from a case, whether for incapacitation or interest.\\" Because district attorneys' offices work closely with police, some activists argue that cases of police misconduct at the state and local level should be handled by special prosecutors. Terminology The terms 'special prosecutor', 'independent counsel', and 'special counsel' have the same fundamental meaning, and their use (at least at the federal level in the U.S.) is generally differentiated by the time period to which they are being applied. The term 'special prosecutor' was used throughout the Watergate era, but was replaced by the less confrontational 'independent counsel' in the 1983 reauthorization of the Ethics in Government Act. Those appointed under that act after 1983 are generally referred to as 'independent counsels'. Since the independent counsel law expired in 1999, the term 'special counsel' has been used. This is the term used in the current U.S. government regulations concerning the appointment of special counsels, such as Title 28 CFR. While the term 'special prosecutor' is sometimes used in historical discussions of such figures before 1983, the term 'special counsel' appears to have been frequently used as well, including, for example, in contemporary newspaper accounts describing the first presidentially-appointed special counsel in 1875. United States appointment at the federal level=History of appointmentsPre-Watergate= The first federal special prosecutor, John B. Henderson, was appointed by Ulysses Grant in 1875 to investigate the Whiskey Ring scandal. After attempting to stifle Henderson's investigation of the president's personal secretary, Grant fired Henderson on the basis that Henderson's statements to a grand jury regarding Grant were impertinent. Following criticism, Grant appointed a new special prosecutor, James Broadhead, to continue the investigation. James Garfield appointed the next special prosecutor, William Cook, in 1881 to investigate the Star route scandal. Cook continued his investigation into the Chester Arthur administration. Under the Theodore Roosevelt administration, special prosecutors were appointed to investigate two scandals. In 1903, Roosevelt appointed two special prosecutors (a Democrat and a Republican) to investigate allegations of bribery at the Post Office Department. In 1905, Roosevelt's attorney general, Philander Knox, appointed Francis Heney special prosecutor to investigate the Oregon land fraud scandal. Calvin Coolidge appointed two special counsels, Atlee Pomerene and Owen Roberts to investigate the Teapot Dome scandal. This appointment was unique in that it was mandated under a special Congressional joint resolution, and was subject to approval in the Senate, similarly to a cabinet appointment. This process was unique in the history of federal special prosecutors. In 1952, Harry Truman appointed Newbold Morris \\"special assistant to the Attorney General\\" to investigate the corruption at the Bureau of Internal Revenue following Congressional pressure and calls for a special prosecutor. After Morris submitted a lengthy questionnaire on personal finances to be completed by all senior executive officers, he was fired by Attorney General Howard McGrath, who was in turn fired by the president. Following the appointment of a new attorney general, the investigation was continued through regular channels. =Watergate= Before his May 25, 1973, appointment as Richard Nixon's attorney general, Elliott Richardson had agreed at his Senate confirmation hearing to appoint a Watergate special prosecutor, and so immediately on taking office appointed Archibald Cox under a special one-time regulation. As part of his investigation, in July of that year, Cox first requested and then subpoenaed the Nixon White House tapes; secret recordings Nixon had made of conversations in the Oval Office and elsewhere. The Nixon administration refused to produce the tapes citing executive privilege, and the dispute was fought in court until October. After a Court of Appeals instructed the president to comply with the special prosecutor's subpoena, Nixon ordered the special prosecutor fired. In a constitutional crisis that became known as the Saturday Night Massacre, both the attorney general and deputy attorney general (who had both made promises regarding the special prosecutor in their Senate confirmation hearings) resigned rather than carry out the order to fire Cox. Solicitor General Robert Bork, who was third in line at the Department of Justice, then fired Cox. Initially, the Nixon White House announced that the office of the special prosecutor had been abolished, but after public outcry Nixon instead had Bork appoint Leon Jaworski as the second Watergate special prosecutor. The firing was ruled illegal in the case of Nader v. Bork, but, as a new special prosecutor had already been appointed, the case was already moot when decided, and the decision was never appealed past the district court. Jaworski continued Cox's pursuit of the White House tapes, but Nixon resisted. He raised separation of powers questions under the U.S. Constitution. Since the special counsel is a member of the executive branch, Nixon argued that the special counsel is ultimately answerable to the president and that the president could not be compelled by a subpoena issued by his own subordinate. The tapes were ultimately released following the Supreme Court decision in United States v. Nixon. Nixon resigned the presidency on August 9, 1974, and Jaworski resigned about two and a half months later, to be replaced by his (and Cox's) deputy, Henry Ruth Jr.‚Äîwho in turn resigned in 1975, leaving Charles Ruff the fourth and final Watergate special prosecutor. Acting under his existing appointment as Watergate special prosecutor, Ruff conducted an unrelated investigation into whether Gerald Ford had misused campaign funds while a congressman, clearing the new president of any wrongdoing. =Ethics in Government Act= Inspired in part by Watergate, in 1978 Congress passed the Ethics in Government Act. Title VI of this act was known as the Special Prosecutor Act and later renamed the Independent Counsel Act, which established formal rules for the appointment of a special prosecutor. The appointment of special prosecutors varied in important ways from appointments made before and since. Majorities of either party within the House or Senate Judiciary Committee could formally request the attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor on a particular matter, but the decision of whether or not to appoint the independent counsel remained with the attorney general and was not reviewable in court. If the attorney general decided not to appoint an independent counsel in response to such a request, they were only required to respond in writing with the reasons. Although the decision to appoint a special prosecutor was still made by the attorney general, the actual selection of the special prosecutor was made by a three-judge panel called the Special Division, selected from the Courts of Appeals. The law did not allow special prosecutors to be removed except under specific circumstances such as wrongdoing or incapacitation. The special prosecutor provisions in the bill were temporary but were reauthorized by Congress in 1983 and 1987, expiring five years later in 1992; they were reinstated for another five years in 1994 before expiring again in 1999. The constitutionality of the law was affirmed by a 7‚Äì1 decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Morrison v. Olson. Roughly twenty special prosecutors (called independent counsels after 1983) were appointed under the Ethics in Government Act and its reauthorizations during the Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton administrations. These include significant investigations into the Iran‚ÄìContra affair and the Whitewater controversy, the latter of which ultimately led to the impeachment of Bill Clinton over the Lewinsky scandal. Numerous smaller investigations into cabinet secretaries for relatively minor offenses, such as drug use, were also carried out by independent counsels during this period. =Whitewater Scandal= During the period 1992‚Äì1994 when the independent counsel provisions were not in force, Attorney General Janet Reno appointed Robert Fiske special counsel to investigate Whitewater. When the law was reauthorized in 1994, Reno invoked it to order an independent counsel be appointed to investigate Whitewater, and suggested Fiske continue in that role. Instead, Ken Starr was given the job by the three-judge panel. Starr resigned and was replaced by Robert Ray in 1999 just before the expiration of the independent counsel statute. Ray formally concluded the Whitewater investigation in 2003. Current regulations Since the expiration of the independent counsel statute in 1999, there has been no federal statutory law governing the appointment of a special counsel. Upon the law's expiration in 1999, the Justice Department, under Attorney General Janet Reno, promulgated procedural regulations governing the appointment of special counsels. =Waco siege= In 1999, these regulations were used by Reno to appoint John Danforth special counsel to investigate the FBI's handling of the Waco siege. =Plame affair= In 2003, during the George W. Bush administration, Patrick Fitzgerald was appointed special counsel to investigate the Plame affair by Deputy Attorney General James Comey after the recusal of Attorney General John Ashcroft. =Special Counsel investigation (2017‚Äì2019)= On May 17, 2017, former FBI Director Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel to take over the previous FBI investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein after the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Legal authority In 1999, the Department of Justice under Attorney General Janet Reno promulgated regulations for the future appointment of special counsels. As of 2018, these regulations remain in effect in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 28, part 600 (28 CFR ¬ß600). The regulations restrict the power to fire the special counsel into the hands of the attorney general alone, and they forbid the firing of the special counsel without good cause. They are internal Department of Justice regulations deriving their power from various acts of Congress, such as U.S. Code, Title 28, section 510 (28 U.S.C. 510). Congress has the power to directly limit the firing of special counsels or to delegate that power to the Attorney General. An agency regulation promulgated within the authority granted by statute has the force and effect of law, is binding upon the body that issues it, and can't be arbitrarily revoked. The existence of a law or regulations specifying the process to appoint a special counsel has not stopped the attorney general (or acting attorney general) from using their statutory authority to appoint a special counsel by other means, as has happened twice. Despite the passage of the Ethics in Government Act the previous year, Paul Curran was appointed to investigate Jimmy Carter's peanut business in 1979 under the attorney general's statutory authority (and was selected by him rather than by a three-judge panel as under the law), ostensibly because the alleged wrongdoing preceded the passage of the act. Patrick Fitzgerald's appointment as special counsel in 2003 was specifically not made under the 28 CFR 600 regulation. The special counsel regulations specify that a special counsel must be a lawyer from outside the US government, while Fitzgerald was already a federal prosecutor at the time of his appointment. Initiating a special counsel investigation The decision to appoint a special counsel rests with the attorney general (or acting attorney general). The current special counsel regulations specify that: The attorney general sets the subject jurisdiction of the special counsel: The choice of whom to appoint is to be made by the attorney general with the following guidelines: Terminating a special counsel investigation Generally, the special counsel him or herself decides when an investigation will terminate, with or without formal charges being pursued. The special counsel typically issues a final report on their investigation at this time. The current special counsel regulations specify that \\"At the conclusion of the Special Counsel's work, he or she shall provide the Attorney General with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the Special Counsel.\\" =Firing the special counsel= The current special counsel regulations specify that: Role of the legislative and judicial branches Since the expiration of the independent counsel provisions in the Ethics in Government Act in 1999, as was the case before 1978, neither Congress nor the courts have any official role in the appointment of a special counsel; however Congress can use other powers to pressure an administration into appointing a special counsel. This happened, for example, in the appointment of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox; senators secured a promise from Attorney General nominee Richardson to appoint a Watergate special prosecutor as a condition of his confirmation. Congress also has independent authority to investigate the president and their close associates through Congressional hearings as part of its government oversight role. At the state level Special prosecutors are appointed in state court with greater frequency than federal, and most often in cases where a conflict of interest arises or to avoid even the appearance such a conflict exists. In local state governments, special prosecutors are appointed by a judge, government official, organization, company or group of citizens to prosecute violations of law committed by one or more governmental agents and procure indictments for actions taken under color of state law.Black's Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004) Prosecutor. Unlike in courts having federal jurisdiction, where the terms \\"special counsel\\" and \\"independent counsel\\" have a uniform definition, in state court meanings of legal terms continually vary, but with \\"special prosecutor\\" referencing the appointment of an attorney (supra) in contemplation of representation and prosecution of one or more government agent(s) for unlawful conduct.

Edensor Park is located 38 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the City of Fairfield. It is mainly a residential area, Edensor Park is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. History John Brown Bossley (1810-1872) came to Australia around 1838 and practised as a chemist in Sydney. Bossley built an English styled farmhouse on his land near Clear Paddock Creek. He called the property Edensor, after a village near Chatsworth in Derbyshire, England. This established the name Edensor Park after Edensor House. Edensor Park and its surrounding suburbs was a rural area until the 1970s, when it was developed into a residential settlement. Edensor Park belonged to the Prospect County Council, before its amalgamation into Fairfield City Council. Commercial area Edensor Park is a mainly residential suburb served by a local shopping centre, Edensor Park Plaza, which features a Coles supermarket and a number of convenient stores and delis. Schools Edensor Park is served by two primary schools Edensor Park Public School and Governor Philip King Public School and three high schools outside the suburb. Sport and recreation Edensor Park has a number of recreation areas including Angle Vale Reserve, Allambie Reserve and Bosnjak Park. It is also home to the Sydney United Sports Centre, home of the Croatian backed football (soccer) team, Sydney United, which was once a member of the now defunct Australian National Soccer League (NSL) and currently plays in the New South Wales Premier League. Another local sporting team is the CVD Edensor Park Cobras Junior Rugby league Football Club, who play in the Parramatta Junior Rugby League Association and use Bosnjak Park as their home ground. Edensor Park is also home to the Nineveh Club, the first Assyrian social club to be built in Australia. The club was constructed in the early 70s using ancient Assyrian features and is distinguished by two winged bulls at the entrance.

They were the earliest Pentax cameras.  Background  alt=An Asahi Pentax S3 camera, facing slightly off- center, with a roll of 35mm film to one side to provide scale In 1957, the Asahi Optical Company (later \\"Pentax\\") introduced the Pentax, a 35 mm Single- lens reflex camera (SLR) camera which was so well received that it influenced the design of 35 mm SLRs worldwide for years to come. The Pentax and its later development and likewise classic 1964 Pentax Spotmatic allowed Asahi Optical Company to develop into a photographic multinational company, eventually leading the company to rename itself \\"Pentax\\" after its seminal product.  Features and market impact  The Asahi Pentax of 1957 featured: * Rapid-wind film advance lever. Earlier 35 mm SLRs, with the sole exception of Exakta's left-handed lever, had knob winders; * Film rewind crank, likewise a first for 35 mm SLRs; * Instant mirror return, unique to the Pentax and its immediate predecessor, the Asahiflex IIb; * Microprism focusing aids on the focus screen, unique to the Pentax. Moreover, the Pentax placed controls in locations that would become standard on 35 mm SLRs from all manufacturers, such as the right-handed rapid wind lever, the bottom right mounted rewind release. It also had a film speed reminder around the film rewind crank, a location that remained standard until the dial went from being merely a reminder to the photographer to actually controlling the light meter built into later SLRs. The two photographic giants, Canon and Nikon did not introduce their own SLR cameras until 1959 with the Canonflex and the F-series respectively. By contrast, the Pentax offered these features at a relatively low price, introducing many photographers to 35 mm SLR photography. The Pentax became so dominant that the 42 mm screw lens mount used on the Pentax and Pentax Spotmatic become known as the \\"Pentax universal screw mount\\" although it had actually been introduced by Praktica in 1949. Previously most makes of camera used proprietary mounts; the use of this mount by other manufacturers allowed owners of M42-equipped cameras to mount lenses from Zeiss, Yashica, Soligor, Vivitar, Topcon, Sigma, Chinon, and many more as well as Asahi's own highly regarded Takumar lenses. These lenses had no other communication with the camera than a diaphragm interface which allowed focusing at full aperture, the lens being stopped down to working aperture on pressing the shutter release. Later cameras required more lens-body communication to implement shutter priority exposure, program auto exposure, and finally, autofocussing, and different manufacturers used different interfaces, ending the era of interoperability. In 1975 Pentax introduced the K mount to replace the 42 mm screw lens mount used so successfully until then.

Its catchment covers an area of , making it the largest river catchment flowing to the eastern coast of Australia. Course and features Formed by the confluence of the Mackenzie and Dawson rivers that drain the Expedition Range and the Carnarvon Range respectively, the Fitzroy River rises near Duaringa and flows initially north by east, then northward near the Goodedulla National Park. The river then flows in an easterly direction near the Lake Learmouth State Forest and parallel with the Bruce Highway through the settlement of , before turning south to where the river is crossed by the Bruce Highway. After flowing through Rockhampton, the river flows south by east past the Berserker Range past Humbug Point to the south of the Flat Top Range and eventually discharging into Keppel Bay in the Coral Sea near the MacKenzie Island Conservation Park. From source to mouth, the Fitzroy River is joined by thirty-six tributaries including the Mackenzie River with its tributaries the Nogoa River, Comet River, Isaac River and its tributary Connors River; and the Dawson River which has two tributaries, the Don River and Dee River. Catchment The catchment area of the river occupies an area of Within the drainage basin an area of is composed of estuarine wetlands and an area of is made up of riverine wetlands. The catchment stretches from the Carnarvon Range in the west to the rivermouth in Keppel Bay, near Rockhampton. It is bounded to the north by the Burdekin River catchment area and to the south by the Burnett River catchment area. Black and White map of the Fitzroy River QueenslandThe river has a mean annual discharge of . There are also a number important aquifers providing for groundwater extractions in the Fitzroy Basin. The Fitzroy River basin is one of a number that experienced extensive flooding during the 2010‚Äì11 Queensland floods. In 2013, flash flooding in the Mount Morgan and Biloela regions brought major flooding to the lower Dawson River catchment. The Don River and the Dee River also rose to new record heights. The Fitzroy River at Rockhampton rose above major flooding to . Reservoirs The Fitzroy River catchment system has many weirs and dams, used for farming, mining and domestic consumption. In the Dawson River sub-catchment, the major reservoirs from source to mouth are the Glebe Weir, the Gyranda Weir, the Theodore Weir, the Moura Weir, the Callide Dam, and the Kroombit Dam. In the Mackenzie River sub-catchment, the major reservoirs are the Comet Weir, the Fairbairn Dam, the Theresa Creek Dam, the Bedford Weir, the Bingegang Weir, and the Tartrus Weir. In the main Fitzroy River sub-catchment the only reservoirs are the Eden Bann Weir and the Fitzroy River Barrage, with the latter capable of holding when full, to provide potable water to Rockhampton city and surrounds. The Fairbairn Dam on the Nogoa River and several weirs downstream on the Mackenzie River provide water for irrigating a wide range of crops including cotton, peanuts, chickpea, corn and horticulture including citrus, table grapes, melons, supplying water for coal mines and domestic use for the town of . History The traditional owners of the area in the Fitzroy River catchment are the Darumbal people, notably the Baiali and Jetimarala clans. They called it Toonooba. Yetimarala (also known as Jetimarala, Yetimaralla, and Bayali) is an Australian Aboriginal language of Central Queensland. Its traditional language region is within the local government areas of Central Highlands Region, on the Boomer Range and Broadsound Range and the Fitzroy River, Killarney Station, Mackenzie River and Isaac River. The river was given its English name by European colonial settlers and pastoralists, Charles and William Archer, on 4 May 1853 in honour of Sir Charles FitzRoy, at the time the Governor of the Colony of New South Wales, as Queensland did not become a separate colony until 1859. The famous boatbuilder Colin Archer was the first known individual to sail up the river, with his cutter \\"Ellida\\". thumb The city of Rockhampton is situated on the river, some from the coast. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the city was a major port, however rocky bars in the river prevented the Fitzroy from being used for navigation any further inland. As ships became larger, the lower reaches became less viable for commercial traffic, and today only pleasure craft and small commercial fishing boats use the river. Wharves which once lined the town reach at Rockhampton have now almost all disintegrated or been removed. Port Alma, in the Fitzroy River delta is now the nearest port to Rockhampton. Predominant industries in the catchment are coal mining, grazing and cotton. Glenmore Homestead was built at a property on the northern bank of the river northwest of Rockhampton. It was originally settled in 1858, is listed on the Queensland Heritage Register and operates as a tourist attraction today. The Fitzroy River in Rockhampton is often utilised for recreation.

In 2003 a crocodile measuring more than long was captured. The most diverse range of freshwater fish in the country are found within the Fitzroy basin. The prized Australian fish, the barramundi, breeds in the river along with sooty grunter and a separate genetic strain of golden perch. Some of the river's floodplain and delta have been classified by BirdLife International as the Fitzroy Floodplain and Delta Important Bird Area (IBA). It regularly supports over 1% of the world population of the sharp-tailed sandpiper as well as having a resident breeding population of the range- restricted mangrove honeyeater. At the mouth of the river researchers have discovered a genetically distinct snubfin dolphins species with a population of just 70 animals. The World Wildlife Fund had concerns that a planned coal port on Balaclava Island by Xstrata could wipe out the local snubfin population. In 2013 Glencore Xstrata halted its plans for the coal port due to high costs and massively reduced worldwide demand for coal. The firm cited a poor medium-term outlook for the coal industry.

It is celebrated yearly on October 26. 1896 Etymology The Nauruan word angam means \\"jubilation\\", \\"celebration\\", \\"to have triumphed over all hardships\\" or \\"to have reached a set goal\\" or \\"coming home\\". General Angam Day is a day of celebration and a time of reflection for the Nauruan people. Twice in its history, the Nauruan population fell below 1,500, and the Nauruan ethnic group have been considered in danger of extinction. On both occasions the Nauruan population recovered. Upon eclipsing a population of 1,500, a number considered to be the minimum required for the survival of a race, Angam Day was declared. The first Angam was in 1932 and the second occasion in 1949. History=Before Angam The first goal came about in 1919, just after World War I, when the war-time occupation of Nauru and other Pacific islands was continued by forces of the British Empire, who had, in contravention of international treaty obligations, wrested these colonies from Imperial Germany. Nauru came under a League of Nations mandate, administered by Australia, New Zealand and Britain. Brigadier-General Thomas Griffiths, the Australian Administrator, held a census. Later, in a meeting with local chiefs, he declared that the population of Nauruans was alarmingly low and that if the Nauruans were to survive as a race, the population should be no less than 1,500. It was declared that when the population of 1,500 was reached, that day would be called Angam Day, would be a public holiday and would be commemorated every year thereafter. Furthermore, the baby who completed the set target would be the Angam Baby and would receive gifts and honour. First Angam 1943 After thirteen years, the Nauruan population reached 1,500 to much jubilation and celebrations. The first Angam Baby was born on October 26, 1932. It turned out there was to be more than one Angam. During the Japanese occupation of Nauru and other Pacific territories during World War II, 1,201 Nauruans were evacuated to Truk (now Chuuk). Of the 1,201 evacuees to Truk only 737 returned after the war, and of the about 600 left behind on Nauru, a total of around 400 survived. The Angam girl, Eidegenegen Eidagaruwo, did not make it back from Truk as she had died of malnutrition and yaws like most of the other Nauruans who had died in Truk. Second Angam The aftermath of WWII showed the Nauruans that, to survive as a race, they would have to strive to increase their population for a second time. The race for a new Angam Baby was on. On March 31, 1949, the people of Boe celebrated when Bethel Enproe Adam was born to parents Kenye and Clarence Adam. Since then, the Nauruans have been able to celebrate Angam once again. Even though Bethel Enproe was born on a different date, October 26 is still held as the official Angam Day.

William Crooks (6 April 1852 ‚Äì 5 June 1921) was a noted trade unionist and politician from Poplar, London, and a member of the Fabian Society. He is particularly remembered for his campaigning work against poverty and inequality. Early life Born in Shirbutt Street, Poplar, Crooks was the third son of a ship's stoker, George Crooks, who lost his arm in an accident when Crooks was three years old. His mother, Caroline Elizabeth (n√©e Coates), then supported the family by working as a seamstress, but money was scarce and five of the children were temporarily forced to enter Poplar workhouse in 1861. This experience had a profound influence on Crooks' views on poverty. Educated at a local poor law school, Crooks worked initially as a grocer's errand boy, then a blacksmith's labourer and then as an apprentice cooper. A keen reader, Crooks learned about reformers such as Richard Cobden and John Bright, and was asked by his fellow workers to speak out about their working conditions. Consequently, he was sacked for being a political agitator. He remained a member of the Coopers Union from 1867 until his death in 1921.  Working men union  After a short spell working in Liverpool, Crooks returned to London and found work in the docks. He developed his speaking skills outside the East India Dock gates.Nick Raynsford in Haworth, Alan, and Hayter, Dianne (eds), Men Who Made Labour, Routledge (2006), p. 48. He also began to give political lectures, and his speaking abilities proved helpful in raising funds for 10,000 striking dockers in the 1889 London Dock Strike. Earlier that year, Crooks, a candidate for the Progressive Party, became one of the first labour members on the London County Council, and subsequently became the first working-class member, and later chairman, of the Poplar Board of Guardians. With support and help from friend and fellow member George Lansbury, Crooks set about reforming the local workhouse, creating a model for other poor law authorities. A prominent local politician, he helped bring about many local improvements. In 1891 he \\"warmly endorsed\\" representation by the London Trades Council to restrict immigration.Gainer, Bernard, The Alien Invasion: The Origins of the Aliens Act 1905, Heinemann (1972), p. 31. On 3 August 1895, Crooks formally opened Island Gardens, a park at the south end of the Isle of Dogs, opposite Greenwich Hospital. He also campaigned for the first Blackwall Tunnel, and as Chairman of the LCC Bridges Committee in 1898, he helped provide the Greenwich and Woolwich foot tunnels (completed in 1902 and 1912 respectively).  Labour politician  Crooks (fifth from left) in 1906, with other leading figures in the party In 1900 Crooks became the first Labour mayor of Poplar, and two years later was elected to Parliament as MP for Woolwich wresting the seat away from the Conservative Party in a massive electoral victory exceeding expectations.Nick Raynsford in Haworth, Alan, and Hayter, Dianne (eds), Men Who Made Labour, Routledge (2006), p. 50. This success was the result of a pact between the Labour Representation Committee and the Liberal Party; his selection as prospective parliamentary candidate had been criticised by the Independent Labour Party.Howell, David, British Workers and the Independent Labour Party, 1888-1906, Manchester University Press (1983), p. 264. At the time, he was only the fourth Labour MP (preceded by James Keir Hardie, Richard Bell and David Shackleton; Arthur Henderson followed later in 1903). As an MP, he retained his working-class roots and contacts, campaigned hard for workers' pensions, supported reforms to limit the powers of the House of Lords, and supported Balfour's Unemployment Bill in 1905. Re-elected in 1906, he supported the reforming Liberal governments of Campbell-Bannerman (1906‚Äì1908) and Asquith (1908‚Äì1910). Crooks lost his seat in Parliament at the January 1910 general election, but was re-elected at the December 1910 general election In 1911 he fell out with the Trades Union Congress over support for the Labour Disputes Bill.Nick Raynsford in Haworth, Alan, and Hayter, Dianne (eds), Men Who Made Labour, Routledge (2006), p. 52. In 1912 he supported the Feeble-Minded Persons (Control) Bill; Crooks has been quoted by the New Statesman as describing disabled people as \\"like human vermin\\" who \\"crawl about doing absolutely nothing, except polluting and corrupting everything they touch\\".Victoria Brignell \\"The eugenics movement Britain wants to forget\\" in the New Statesman, 9 December 2010. The full quote is: > \\"I have taken part, in discussions in this House on the unemployable; I have > taken Members in authority on both sides and shown them 300 or 400 men not > one of whom would be privately employed by any person for anything at all, > not even for their keep.

In 1916 he was one of the Labour MPs to form part of the executive of Viscount Milner's 'patriotic Labour' British Workers League (BWL).Scally, Robert James, The Origins of the Lloyd George Coalition: The Politics of Social-Imperialism, 1900‚Äì1918, Princeton University Press (1975), p. 263. Under pressure from the Labour Party he resigned from the BWL at the end of 1917.Tyler, Paul, Labour's Lost Leader: The Life and Politics of Will Crooks, Tauris (2007), p. 210. In 1918 he was returned unopposed for the new Woolwich East constituency. He remained an MP until ill-health forced his retirement in February 1921. He died in the London Hospital, Whitechapel four months later, and was buried in Tower Hamlets Cemetery.  Legacy  In 1930, one of the Woolwich Ferry paddle- steamers was named in his memory (taken out of service in 1963). A council housing estate in his native Poplar still bears his name, as does a road in Eltham, just south of Woolwich. ReferencesGallery File:Will Crooks.jpgPicture of Will Crooks, by G.

He has also written under the pen names Lemuel Johnston, Angerford and Lea, Adamai Philotunus and Per Anum Ad Astra. His regular satirical column The Satanist's Diary was published in the magazine Aquarian Arrow during the 1980s and early 1990s under the pen name The Hon Hugo C StJ l'Estrange and included a multitude of other pen names as contributors. Early life Snell was born 17 April 1945 in Kings Langley, Hertfordshire before his family moved to the Gloucestershire, Cotswolds that same year. In his youth, he enjoyed a series of scholarships that brought him to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he graduated in Pure Mathematics. His writings on Austin Osman Spare in Agape Occult Review (1972) and his magical theories published in SSOTBME - An Essay on Magic (1974) and Thundersqueak (1978) brought him into contact with the nascent chaos magic movement in the 1970s. This comparatively rigorous and modern style of magic, largely shaped by fellow scientist Peter Carroll, provided a fertile ground for his own ideas. Career In 1977, he performed a well-known, but notably laborious and rarely attempted ritual called the Abramelin operation.Hine, Phil. An Interview with Ramsey Dukes in HEAD magazine. Since 1972 he has written and published several books noted for their impact on late 20th-century magic and humor. Words Made Flesh (1987) was written from a more philosophical point of view and notable for its original outline of the \\"information model\\" theory of magic that our universe could be a virtual reality--as later explored in The Matrix. It is an example of the author's ongoing studies in the relationship between magic and rationalism. Dukes has worked on the subject of magic with diverse associates including the Ordo Templi Orientis and Illuminates of Thanateros.Hine, Phil. An Interview with Ramsey Dukes in HEAD magazine.

It consists of three tribes, the lories and lorikeets (Loriini), the budgerigar (Melopsittacini) and the fig parrots (Cyclopsittini), which are small birds, mostly of bright colors and inhabitants of Oceania and the islands of Southeast Asia. Taxonomy Traditionally it was considered that the lories were the only members of the subfamily Loriinae, or were integrated into their own family, Loriidae, but currently they are classified as a tribe, Loriini, within a larger subfamily Loriinae. The genetic studies showed that the lories are closely related to the budgerigar and the fig parrots of the genera Cyclopsitta and Psittaculirostris, that form the other two tribes that make up the subfamily, Melopsittacini and Cyclopsittini, respectively. Loriinae is integrated as one of the five subfamilies of the family Psittaculidae, together with Psittaculinae, Platycercinae, Psittacellinae, Agapornithinae; and in turn Psittaculidae forms together with two families more the superfamily Psittacoidea.

A modern bow tie is tied using a common shoelace knot, which is also called the bow knot for that reason. It consists of a ribbon of fabric tied around the collar of a shirt in a symmetrical manner, so that the two opposite ends form loops. There are generally three types of bow ties: the pre-tied, the clip on, and the self tie. Pre-tied bow ties are ties in which the distinctive bow is sewn onto a band that goes around the neck and clips to secure. Some \\"clip-ons\\" dispense with the band altogether, instead clipping straight to the collar. The traditional bow tie, consisting of a strip of cloth which the wearer has to tie by hand, is also known as a \\"self-tie\\", \\"tie-it-yourself\\", or \\"freestyle\\" bow tie. Bow ties may be made of any fabric material, but most are made from silk, polyester, cotton, or a mixture of fabrics. Some fabrics (e.g., wool or velvet) are much less common for bow ties than for ordinary four-in-hand neckties. Origin and history Johan Krouth√©n wearing a bow tie The bow tie originated among Croatian mercenaries during the Thirty Years' War of the 17th century: the Croat mercenaries used a scarf around the neck to hold together the opening of their shirts. This was soon adopted (under the name cravat, derived from the French for \\"Croat\\") by the upper classes in France, then a leader in fashion, and flourished in the 18th and 19th centuries. It is uncertain whether the cravat then evolved into the bow tie and four-in-hand necktie, or whether the cravat gave rise to the bow tie, which in turn led to the four-in-hand necktie. The most traditional bow ties are usually of a fixed length and are made for a specific size neck. Sizes can vary between approximately 14 and 19 inches as with a comparable shirt collar. Fixed-length bow ties are preferred when worn with the most formal wing-collar shirts, so as not to expose the buckle or clasp of an adjustable bow tie. Adjustable bow ties are the standard when the tie is to be worn with a less formal, lie-down collar shirt that obscures the neckband of the tie. \\"One-size-fits-all\\" adjustable bow ties are a later invention that helps to moderate production costs. Karl Michael Ziehrer wearing a 19th-century style bow tie Stereotypes of bow tie wearers > To its devotees, the bow tie suggests iconoclasm of an Old World sort, a > fusty adherence to a contrarian point of view. The bow tie hints at > intellectualism, real or feigned, and sometimes suggests technical acumen, > perhaps because it is so hard to tie. Bow ties are worn by magicians, > country doctors, lawyers and professors and by people hoping to look like > the above. But perhaps most of all, wearing a bow tie is a way of > broadcasting an aggressive lack of concern for what other people think. > \\\\- Warren St John in The New York Times Instructions on a common way to tie a bow tie Popular perception tends to associate bow tie wearers with particular professions, such as architects, finance receipt collectors, attorneys, university professors, teachers, waiters, and politicians. Pediatricians frequently wear bow ties, for infants cannot grab them the way they could grab a four-in-hand necktie. Bow ties do not readily droop into places where they would get soiled or where they could, whether accidentally or deliberately, strangle the wearer. Clowns sometimes use an oversize bow tie for its comic effect. Classical musicians traditionally perform in white tie or black tie ensembles, of which both designs are bow ties. Bow ties are also associated with weddings, mainly because of their almost universal inclusion in traditional formal attire. Bow ties, or slight variations thereof, have also made their way into women's wear, especially business attire. The 1980s saw professional women, especially in law, banking, and the corporate world, donning very conservative tailored suits, with a rise of almost 6 million units in sales. These were often worn with buttoned-up blouses, some with pleats up the front like tuxedo shirts, and accessorized with bow ties that were slightly fuller than the standard bow ties worn by their male counterparts, but typically consisting of the same fabrics, colors, and patterns as men's ties. Russell Smith, style columnist for Toronto's The Globe and Mail, records mixed opinions of bow tie wearers. He observed that bow ties were experiencing a potential comeback among men, though \\"the class conscious man recoils at the idea\\" of pre-tied bow ties and \\"[l]eft-wingers ... recoil at what they perceive to be a symbol of political conservatism.\\" He argues that, however, that anachronism is the point, and that bow tie wearers are making a public statement that they disdain changing fashion. Such people may not be economic conservatives, he argues, but they are social conservatives. In Smith's view, the bow tie is \\"the embodiment of propriety\\", an indicator of fastidiousness, and \\"an instant sign of nerddom in Hollywood movies\\", but \\"not the mark of a ladies' man\\" and \\"not exactly sexy\\". He attributes the building of this image to the association of the bow tie with newspaper editors (because of their fastidiousness with words), high- school principals, and bachelor English teachers. Most men, he observes, only wear bow ties with formal dress. Current The four-in-hand necktie is still more prominent in contemporary Western society; it is seen the most at business meetings, formal functions, schools, and sometimes even at home. However, the bow tie is making a comeback at fun-formal events such as dinners, cocktail parties, and nights out on the town. Bow ties are often worn with suits by those trying to convey a more dressed-up, formal image, whether in business or social venues. Bow ties are still generally popular with men of all ages in the American South, having never gone out of fashion there. Traditional opinion remains that it is inappropriate to wear anything other than a bow tie with a dinner jacket. Bow ties are also sometimes worn as an alternative to ascot ties and four-in-hand neckties when wearing morning dress. The dress code of \\"black tie\\" requires a black bow tie. Most military mess dress uniforms incorporate a bow tie. Types=Self-tie If choosing a self-tie/tie-it-yourself/freestyle bow tie, there are usually two shapes available: the \\"bat wing\\", which is parallel-sided like a cricket bat, and the \\"thistle\\", also known as the \\"butterfly\\". An example of each can also be seen below. Which is worn is a matter of personal preference. Some other shapes do exist; for instance, the Diamond Point, with pointed tips at both ends. This is a double-ended type, with both ends shaped, though occasionally, ties are tied in the single-ended type, in which only one end flares out to give the batwing or thistle shape, and the other remains thin. To tie one of these requires careful consideration, to ensure the broader end finishes in front of the thinner one. File:2 Silk Bow Ties.JPGSilk bow ties.

Wearing a ready- tied bow tie at formal occasions requiring a black or white tie dress code is usually considered a faux pas, though at occasions such as Schools Leavers' Proms or ones at which the participants are unlikely to have had much experience wearing bow ties, it may be commonplace. As shown in the pictures below, another type of ready-tie bow tie is the wooden bow tie, a fairly new product made mostly in the U.S and Canada. Other materials are also in use.

The sculpture is intended to invoke the prow of a Viking longship Wood Quay () is a riverside area of Dublin that was a site of Viking settlement. The site is bounded on the north side by Wood Quay on the River Liffey, on the west by Winetavern Street, on the south by John's Lane and on the east by Fishamble Street. Dublin Corporation acquired Wood Quay gradually between 1950 and 1975, finally announcing that it would be the location of their new offices. Large-scale archaeological excavations were conducted on the site by the National Museum of Ireland at intervals between 1974 and 1981. Finds made during the excavations of the site led to a significant, but ultimately unsuccessful, public campaign to halt the development. Artefacts from the excavations are now on display in the National Museum of Ireland. Most of the quay is now entirely occupied by Dublin City Council's Civic Offices. Two bridges cross the river at Wood Quay, one at the eastern and the other at the western end. The bridge at the eastern end is Grattan Bridge, formerly known as Essex Bridge, named after 18th century parliamentarian Henry Grattan. This bridge, which resembles Westminster Bridge in London, was until the 18th century the most easterly and therefore the closest to the sea of the Liffey Bridges. The bridge at the westerly end of Wood Quay is O'Donovan Rossa Bridge named after the 19th century Fenian. In a later excavation between 1990 and 1993 further along the quay at Lower Exchange Street, an archaeological dig team unearthed a roundtower-like ruin from the 13th century called Isolde's Tower. This tower was first discovered in the 17th century, but most of it was destroyed and covered in. Because of the dig, the construction of underground parking facilities for a planned development on the site could not be constructed at their intended location. The tower ruins are now viewable through railings on Lower Exchange Street, and the car park ramp is further to the left.

Construction started in 1978 and it began operation 6 years later, on 15 January 1985. It was the 4th tallest tower in the world from 1985 to 1991. Moreover, the decision of construction Tashkent Tower or TV-Tower of Uzbekistan was decided in 1971 in 1 September in order to spread the TV and radio signals to all over the Uzbekistan. It is of a vertical cantilever structure, and is constructed out of steel. Its architectural design is a product of the Terxiev, Tsarucov & Semashko firm. The tower has an observation deck located above the ground. It is second tallest structure in Central Asia after Ekibastuz GRES-2 Power Station in Ekibastuz, Kazakhstan. It also belongs to the World Federation of Great Towers. Use The main purposes of the tower are radio and TV-transmission. The signal reaches the farthest points of Tashkent Province and some of the south regions of Kazakhstan. The tower is also used for communication between governmental departments, and organizations. The tower also serves as a complex hydrometeorological station.

Rolls-Royce is the world's second-largest maker of aircraft engines (after General Electric) and has major businesses in the marine propulsion and energy sectors. Rolls-Royce was the world's 16th largest defence contractor in 2018 when measured by defence revenues. Rolls-Royce Holdings plc is listed on the London Stock Exchange, where it is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. As of close of London trading on 28 August 2019, the company had a market capitalisation of ¬£4.656bn, the 85th-largest of any company with a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange. The company's registered office is at Kings Place, near Kings Cross in London. History=Ownership Rolls-Royce grew from the engineering business of Henry Royce which was established in 1884 and ten years later began to manufacture dynamos and electric cranes. Charles Rolls established a separate business with Royce in 1904 because Royce had developed a range of cars which Rolls wanted to sell. A corporate owner was incorporated in 1906 with the name Rolls-Royce Limited. In 1971 the same company, Rolls-Royce Limited, entered voluntary liquidation because it was unable to meet its financial obligations though it remains in existence today, still in liquidation, with a file number for its name. Its business and assets were bought by the government using a company created for the purpose named Rolls- Royce (1971) limited. Rolls-Royce Motors was separated out in 1973. The (1971) company remains in existence today and carries on Rolls-Royce business under the name Rolls-Royce plc. Rolls-Royce plc returned to the stock market in 1987 under the government of Margaret Thatcher. In 2003 ownership of Rolls-Royce plc was passed to Rolls-Royce Group plc incorporated 21 March 2003 which issued its own new shares for payment to the previous shareholders. In the same way, Rolls-Royce Group plc passed ownership on 23 May 2011 to Rolls-Royce Holdings plc, a wholly new company incorporated 10 February 2011.Rolls-Royce Holdings plc, Annual Report 2011 accessed 27 January 2017 Rolls-Royce plc remains the principal trading company. Rolls-Royce Holdings plc, like its immediate predecessor, is merely a holding company. ;Companies with shares available to the general public * 1906 company, Rolls-Royce Limited. Its shares became more or less valueless in 1971 and their price sank as low as a penny from a high of ¬£1.25. :By the time the liquidation was effectively complete those shareholders had received more than ¬£0.60 per share from the liquidation and they may have bought them for around a penny. * 1971 company, floated as Rolls-Royce plc still owns the principal business but itself was sold to the new holding company in 2003 * 2003 company floated as Rolls-Royce Group plc bought the 1971 company * 2011 company floated as Rolls-Royce Holdings plc bought the 1971 company from the 2003 company Growth The 1980s saw the introduction of a policy to offer an engine fitment on a much wider range of civil aircraft types, with the company's engines now powering 17 different airliners (and their variants) compared to General Electric's 14 and Pratt & Whitney's 10. The civil engines business represents the company's main area of growth: between 2010 and 2018, Rolls-Royce invested ¬£11 billion in facilities and R&D; and launched six new civil engines including the Trent XWB and the Pearl 15 for the business aviation market. It secured orders for 2,700 engines for wide-body aircraft and business jets. It expects to produce over 600 wide-body engines a year and should power over half of the world wide-body fleet within a few years, up from 22% a decade before. Restructuring In February 2017 Rolls-Royce posted its largest ever pre- tax loss of ¬£4.6 billion; This included a ¬£4.4 billion writedown on financial hedges that the company uses to protect itself against currency fluctuations, and a ¬£671 million penalty to settle bribery and corruption charges with the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), the US Department of Justice, and Brazilian authorities. On 14 June 2018 the company announced a restructuring of the business to create three simpler decentralised units (civil aerospace, defence and power systems), to rationalise back office functions and to remove middle management functions. The cost savings should amount to ¬£400 million per year by 2020, with an up-front restructuring cost of ¬£500 million. Some 4,600 people are likely to leave the business out of 55,000 employed worldwide, 3,000 job losses from the UK and the rest from elsewhere in the world (15,700 of the employees work in Derby and 10,300 work elsewhere in the United Kingdom). In August 2018 Rolls-Royce announced it was taking a charge of ¬£554 million to cover faults with some Trent 1000 engines on Boeing 787 Dreamliners; Rather than going thousands of hours between inspections, the faults with turbine blades mean the engines currently require inspection every 300 hours of flight. In the same announcement Rolls-Royce said it would spend ¬£450m fixing faults on the Trent 1000 in 2018, ¬£450m in 2019 and ¬£350m in 2020, with the work complete by 2022. In May 2020, the company announced that they will be cutting one fifth of their jobs (around 9,000) worldwide as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Around 3,000 job losses were expected in the UK, half of them in Derby.  Facilities = Testing  Rolls-Royce's ¬£90 million test bed 80 will be the largest of its kind, sized for engines of up to of thrust. Design started in 2017, construction began in 2018 and it should be commissioned by mid-2020. The facility is long, has a tall intake tower and a tall exhaust stack. Built from 3,450 tons of steel and of concrete, it has a tall and wide enclosed space and it can handle a 66 tons engine including its carrier. X-ray imaging allows to visualize the position of seals and clearances in real time while an engine is running. While it was retrofitted on Rolls' test bed 57, test bed 80 is the first to be purpose-designed for industrial radiography. To protect from external X-ray like 30 cm (11.8 in.) of lead, double walls are up to 8.9 ft. (2.7 m) thick (a 5.6-ft. interior wall and 3.3-ft. exterior wall) and provide acoustic insulation. Canadian prime contractor MDS Aero Support is responsible for design and management, test systems supply, engine adapters, support systems and data acquisition and control while construction is done by Buckingham Group Contracting. Acquisitions ;Northern Engineering Industries / broken up and sold In 1988, Rolls-Royce acquired Northern Engineering Industries (NEI), a group of heavy engineering companies mainly associated with electrical generation and power management, based in the North East of England. The group included Clarke Chapman (cranes), Reyrolle (now part of Siemens) and Parsons (now part of Siemens steam turbines). The company was renamed Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group. It was sold off piecemeal over the next decade as the company re- focused on its core aero-engine operations following the recession of the early 1990s. ;Allison Engine Company/Rolls-Royce Corporation On 21 November 1994, Rolls-Royce announced its intention to acquire the Allison Engine Company, an American manufacturer of gas turbines and components for aviation, industrial and marine engines.Lazonick, William & Prencipe, Andrea. \\"Sustaining the Innovation Process: The Case of Rolls-Royce plc\\" page 18. Retrieved: 18 September 2010. Archive The two companies had a technical association dating back to the Second World War. Rolls-Royce had previously tried to buy the company when General Motors sold it in 1993, but GM opted for a management buyout instead for $370 million. Owing to Allison's involvement in classified and export restricted technology, the 1994 acquisition was subject to investigation to determine the national security implications.Ashbourne, Alex. Opening the US Defence Market Centre for European Reform page 6, October 2000. Retrieved: 18 September 2010. On 27 March 1995, the US Department of Defense announced that the \\"deal between Allison Engine Co. and Rolls-Royce does not endanger national security.\\"\\"DoD is satisfied that deal between Allison Engine Co. and Rolls Royce does not endanger national security\\" United States Department of Defense, 27 March 1995. Retrieved: 3 October 2012. Archived on 14 October 2013. Rolls-Royce was, however, obliged to set up a proxy board to manage Allison and had also to set up a separate company, Allison Advanced Development Company, Inc., to manage classified programmes \\"that involve leading-edge technologies\\" such as the Joint Strike Fighter program. In 2000, this restriction was replaced by a more flexible Special Security Arrangement.Lorell et al Going Global? page 175, RAND Corporation, 2002. Retrieved: 18 September 2010.

Archive The Allison acquisition, at $525 million (equivalent to ¬£328 million), brought four new engine types into the Rolls-Royce civil engine portfolio on seven platforms and several light aircraft applications. Allison is now known as Rolls-Royce Corporation, part of Rolls-Royce North America. ;Vickers/Vinters In 1999 Rolls-Royce acquired Vickers plc for its marine businesses. The portion retained is now Vinters Engineering Limited. Rolls-Royce sold Vickers Defence Systems (the other major Vickers area of business) to Alvis plc in 2002, which then became Alvis Vickers. ;BMW joint venture / Rolls-Royce Deutschland Rolls- Royce has established a leading position in the corporate and regional airline sector through the development of the Tay engine, the Allison acquisition and the consolidation of the BMW Rolls-Royce joint venture. In 1999, BMW Rolls- Royce was renamed Rolls-Royce Deutschland and became a 100% owned subsidiary of Rolls-Royce plc. ;SAIC joint venture / Optimized Systems and Solutions Optimized Systems and Solutions Limited (formerly known as Data Systems & Solutions) was founded in 1999 as a joint venture between Rolls-Royce plc and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). In early 2006, SAIC exited the joint venture agreement, making Rolls-Royce plc the sole owner. ;Tognum joint venture with Daimler / Rolls-Royce Power Systems Holding GmbH In March 2011, Rolls-Royce and Daimler AG launched a $4.2 billion public tender offer for 100 per cent of the share capital of Tognum AG, the owner of MTU Friedrichshafen ‚Äì a leading high-speed industrial and marine diesel engine manufacturer, which was completed using a 50:50 joint venture company. Rolls- Royce and Daimler AG intend that the joint venture company, which also now incorporates Rolls-Royce's existing Bergen engine business, is listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. ;Aero Engine Controls / Rolls-Royce Controls and Data Services Following the acquisition of Goodrich by United Technologies Corporation in July 2012, Rolls-Royce announced it would purchase Goodrich's 50% share of Aero Engine Controls to become wholly owned by Rolls-Royce Plc and a part of the Rolls-Royce Group. At the June 2019 Paris Air Show, Rolls- Royce announced its acquisition of Siemens' electric propulsion branch (while they are partners on the E-Fan X demonstrator), to be completed in late 2019, employing 180 in Germany and Hungary. Divestment=Siemens In May 2014, Rolls-Royce sold its energy gas turbine and compressor business to Siemens for ¬£785 million. Kongsberg In July 2018, Rolls-Royce sold its commercial marine business to Kongsberg for ¬£500 million. Nuclear services businesses In September 2019, Rolls-Royce agreed to sell its civil nuclear services businesses in the U.S., Canada, Mondragon France, and Gateshead UK to the Westinghouse Electric Company for an undisclosed sum. These businesses had a revenue of $70 million and about 500 employees in 2018. Rolls-Royce is keeping its nuclear new build and small modular reactor business in the UK. Major sales In 1990, BMW and Rolls-Royce established the BMW Rolls-Royce joint venture to produce the BR700 range of engines for regional and corporate jets, including the BR725 powering the Gulfstream G650, which received EASA Type Certification in June 2009. ;Airbus A380 In 1996, Rolls-Royce and Airbus signed a Memorandum of Understanding, specifying the Trent 900 as the engine of choice for the then A3XX, now called the Airbus A380. ;Boeing On 6 April 2004, Boeing announced that it had selected both Rolls-Royce and General Electric to power its new 787. Rolls-Royce submitted the Trent 1000, a further development of that series. GE's offering is the GENX, a development of the GE90. ;UK C-130 Hercules On 13 June 2004, Rolls-Royce was awarded a ¬£110m contract by the Ministry of Defence to supply engines for its C-130 Hercules transport aircraft over the following 5 years. ;Airbus A350 In July 2006, Rolls-Royce reached an agreement to supply a new version of the Trent for the revised Airbus A350 (XWB) jetliner. This engine, the Trent XWB is an engine developed from the Trent 1000, a variant of which was offered for the original A350 proposal. As of July 2015, over 1,500 engines of this type have been supplied to 40 customers. In October 2006, Rolls-Royce suspended production of its Trent 900 engine because of delays by Airbus on the delivery of the A380 superjumbo. Rolls-Royce announced in October 2007 that production of the Trent 900 had been restarted after a twelve-month suspension caused by delays to the A380. ;Tornado, Typhoon and Lightning On the military side, Rolls-Royce, in co-operation with other European manufacturers, has been a major contractor for the RB199 which in several variants powers the Panavia Tornado, and also for the EJ200 engine for the Eurofighter Typhoon. Two modified RB199 engines also powered the EAP demonstrator which evolved into the Typhoon. Rolls-Royce has matured the Rolls-Royce LiftSystem invented by Lockheed Martin for the F-35 Lightning II to production level; The F-35 is planned to be produced in significant numbers. ;Air China At the 2005 Paris Air Show, Rolls-Royce secured in excess of $1 billion worth of orders. The firm received $800m worth of orders from Air China to supply its 20 Airbus A330 jets. ;Qatar Airways On 18 June 2007, Rolls-Royce announced at the 2007 Paris Air Show that it had signed its biggest ever contract with Qatar Airways for the Trent XWB to power 80 A350 XWBs on order from Airbus worth $5.6 billion at list prices. On 11 November 2007, another large contract was announced at the Dubai Airshow from Emirates for Trent XWBs to power 50 A350-900 and 20 A350-1000 aircraft with 50 option rights. Due to be delivered from 2014, the order is potentially worth up to 8.4 billion US Dollars at list prices, including options. On 20 November 2007, Rolls-Royce announced plans to build its first Asian aero engine facility in the Seletar Aerospace Park, Singapore. The $562m (¬£355m) plant complements its existing facility at Derby by concentrating on the assembly and testing of large civil engines, including Trent 1000 and Trent XWB. Productivity will be higher than at Derby, as the plant is fully integrated, as opposed to manufacturing occurring across five sites in the UK: a Trent 900 will take only 14 days to manufacture, as opposed to 20 in the UK. Originally expected to provide employment for 330 people, by the start of production in 2012, 1,600 employees were based in Singapore. During the 2011 Avalon Airshow, Rolls-Royce faced questions concerning incidents with its Trent 900 Turbofan used to power the Airbus A380 aircraft. One of the engines suffered a partial power loss during a Qantas flight in February 2011. This followed an incident in November 2010 in which an engine disintegrated in flight causing Qantas Flight 32 to make an emergency landing in Singapore. The aircraft was extensively damaged and the airline grounded its fleet of A380s. The problem was traced to a fatigue crack in an oil pipe requiring the replacement of some engines and modifications to the design. Trent-powered A380s operated by Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines were also affected. Qantas gradually returned its A380s to service over several months. In June 2011 the airline announced it had agreed to compensation of US$100m from Rolls-Royce. ;Nuclear submarines In May 2012, Rolls-Royce won a Ministry of Defence contract worth more than ¬£400 million for the integration of the reactor design, the PWR3, for UK's next generation nuclear-armed submarines. ;Emirates On 17 April 2015, it was announced that Rolls-Royce had received its largest order to date worth ¬£6.1bn ($9.2bn) to supply engines for 50 Emirates A380 planes. Corruption allegations Rolls-Royce has been accused numerous times of corrupt practices and bribery. Most recently, in 2014, facing allegations of bribery in the aftermath of the Sudhir Choudhrie affair, Rolls-Royce offered to return money to the Indian government. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) also investigated allegations of bribery in Indonesia and China. In February 2015 Rolls-Royce was accused of bribing an employee of Brazil's state-controlled oil company to win a $100 million contract to provide gas turbines for oil platforms. In October 2016 a joint Guardian and BBC investigation alleged widespread corruption by Rolls-Royce through middlemen in foreign countries including Brazil, India, China, Indonesia, South Africa, Angola, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. Rolls-Royce became subject to a major SFO investigation. Alleged defects In 2013 media reported allegations from two American ex-employees that thousands of the company's new jet engines were assembled with used parts. Settlement with SFO In January 2017 Rolls-Royce came to an agreement with the SFO to pay ¬£671 million under a deferred prosecution agreement to avoid prosecution for bribery to obtain export contracts. As part of this agreement, a $170 million fine was paid to US authorities to end a bribery investigation, and $25 million to the Brazilian authorities. Subsequent to the settlement, Private Eye reported that some of Rolls-Royce's contracts under the scope of the SFO investigation had been supported by the British government's UK Export Finance department, using taxpayers' money. The government department underwrote multimillion-pound liabilities under Rolls-Royce contracts secured with the help of bribes and \\"facilitation\\" commissions. It has also been highlighted in the press that Rolls-Royce's auditor since 1995, KPMG, had failed to identify any corrupt practices throughout the 1990s and 2000s. This is notable considering judge Brian Leveson's statement that Rolls-Royce's offending was \\"multi- jurisdictional, numerous\\", \\"persistent and spanned from 1989 until 2013\\", and it \\"involved substantial funds being made available to fund bribe payments\\".

From 1984 to 2006, he was the Waynflete Professor of Pure Mathematics at Magdalen College, Oxford. He is known for being the \\"prime architect\\" of higher algebraic K-theory, for which he was awarded the Cole Prize in 1975 and the Fields Medal in 1978. Education and career Quillen was born in Orange, New Jersey, and attended Newark Academy. He entered Harvard University, where he earned both his AB, in 1961, and his PhD in 1964; the latter completed under the supervision of Raoul Bott, with a thesis in partial differential equations. He was a Putnam Fellow in 1959. Quillen obtained a position at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology after completing his doctorate. He also spent a number of years at several other universities. He visited France twice: first as a Sloan Fellow in Paris, during the academic year 1968-69, where he was greatly influenced by Grothendieck, and then, during 1973‚Äì74, as a Guggenheim Fellow. In 1969‚Äì70, he was a visiting member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he came under the influence of Michael Atiyah. In 1978, Quillen received a Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Helsinki. Quillen retired at the end of 2006. He died from complications of Alzheimer's disease on April 30, 2011, aged 70, in Florida. Mathematical contributions Quillen's best known contribution (mentioned specifically in his Fields medal citation) was his formulation of higher algebraic K-theory in 1972. This new tool, formulated in terms of homotopy theory, proved to be successful in formulating and solving problems in algebra, particularly in ring theory and module theory. More generally, Quillen developed tools (especially his theory of model categories) that allowed algebro-topological tools to be applied in other contexts. Before his work in defining higher algebraic K-theory, Quillen worked on the Adams conjecture, formulated by Frank Adams, in homotopy theory. His proof of the conjecture used techniques from the modular representation theory of groups, which he later applied to work on cohomology of groups and algebraic K-theory. He also worked on complex cobordism, showing that its formal group law is essentially the universal one. In related work, he also supplied a proof of Serre's conjecture about the triviality of algebraic vector bundles on affine space, which led to the Bass‚ÄìQuillen conjecture. He was also an architect (along with Dennis Sullivan) of rational homotopy theory. He introduced the Quillen determinant line bundle and the Mathai‚ÄìQuillen formalism.

He matriculated from St. Peter's College, Rosetenville in Johannesburg in 1946. After matric, he registered for a Junior Teaching Diploma at the Diocesan Teachers' Training College in Polokwane (then called Pietersburg). He studied towards a Higher Primary Teacher‚Äôs Diploma at Bethel College in the Transvaal from 1951. After graduating he started teaching and specialised as an Afrikaans teacher. He taught at secondary schools in Mahikeng, Motswedi, Krugersdorp and Potchefstroom and was awarded in 1959 when one of his classes obtained the best results in Afrikaans among competing schools in South Africa. Career When the Tswana Territorial Authority was established in 1961, Mangope became the vice-chairman, working under Chief TR Pilane. He was promoted to the Chief Chancellor of the organisation in 1968. He remained in the position until 1972 when he became the first Chief Minister of Bophuthatswana. He was also accused of spying for foreign powers, misappropriation of state funds, repossession of land from tribal authorities without adequate compensation and discrepancies in appointments and salaries within the Bophuthatswana Defence Force. Homelands He became President in 1977, when Bophuthatswana was declared independent by the South African government. On 10 February 1988 he was briefly overthrown by members of a military police unit, led by Rocky Malebane-Metsing of the People's Progressive Party (PPP), who had accused Mangope of corruption and charged that the recent election had been rigged in the government's favour. Mangope was reinstated following intervention by the South African Defence Force. South Africa's government stated that it was responding to a request for assistance from the legal government of a sovereign nation. Sasha Polakow- Suransky (a Jewish-American journalist and author) wrote that Mangope was \\"widely considered a puppet and a joke in South Africa\\" during his presidency. Mangope was nevertheless given some recognition during visits to Israel, meeting with prominent figures such as Moshe Dayan. Bophuthatswana had an unofficial \\"embassy\\" in Israel in the 1980s despite objections from the Israeli Foreign Ministry, which did not recognize the bantustan as a state. Mangope was accused of using his defence force and police to suppress protests, and had been accused of police brutality when a student protest was suppressed by his police force. Mangope's supporters, however, have argued that Bophuthatswana was comparatively more successful than other Bantustans in social and economic development, owing to its mineral wealth.Bophuthatswana was better - Sipho Mfundisi - politicsweb.zo.zaBophuthatswana: A further reply to Setumo Stone - Sipho Mfundisi - politicsweb.co.za Although designated as an ethnic Tswana homeland, Bophuthatswana was more or less an integrated society where Apartheid legislation did not apply, in common with other homelands.\\\\- South African school a double-edged legacy of apartheid's homelandsHomeland, Apartheid's Child, Is Defying Change 1994 crisis At the Kempton Park negotiations in 1993 that led to the first non-racial election in South Africa in 1994, Mangope had made it clear that Bophuthatswana would remain independent of the new and integrated South Africa and that he would not allow the upcoming election to take place in \\"his country\\".

After the transition to nonracial democracy, Mangope remained active in politics, forming the United Christian Democratic Party in 1997. Party support was confined to the North West Province (which contained most of Bophuthatswana), and at its peak it held three seats out of 400 in the National Assembly. His party argued that under the Xhosa-led ANC, their quality of life in the province would deteriorate and that conditions were improved because Tswana people ruled themselves. Mangope led the party for fifteen years, but was expelled from the party in 2012. He had been accused of being autocratic, but failed to attend his disciplinary hearing, and had his membership terminated. In the runup to the following election, in 2014, many of the party's members, encouraged by Mangope, left to join the Democratic Alliance. The party subsequently lost all of its seats including those in the provincial parliament and provincial legislature.See United Christian Democratic Party  Beliefs  Speaking to the Financial Mail in June 1980, Mangope professed his belief in capitalist free enterprise, saying it would lead to \\"true freedom and prosperity for our people\\" if it is \\"regulated by a strong sense of social responsibility\\". He lamented the fact that capitalism had failed to make itself more appealing in Africa and to defend itself against the attacks of Marxism. According to Mangope, free enterprise has led to more material prosperity in those African nations which adopted it.

During his time as archbishop the Church of England ordained its first women priests and the debate over attitudes to homosexuality became more prominent, especially at the 1998 Lambeth Conference of Anglican bishops. In June 2017 he resigned from his last formal role in the church after a finding that he had covered up child sex abuse allegations against the bishop Peter Ball. In 2018 the UK Child Sex Abuse Report found Carey had committed serious breaches of duty in covering up child sex abuse within the Church. In February 2018 Carey was granted \\"permission to officiate\\" by Steven Croft, the bishop of Oxford, allowing him to preach and preside at churches in the diocese. This was revoked on 17 June 2020 as the Church of England said that there was new evidence linking Carey to a review into abuse committed by John Smyth. Early life George Carey was born on 13 November 1935 in the East End of London in the United Kingdom. He attended Bonham Road Primary School in Dagenham, then failed his 11-plus. He then attended Bifrons Secondary Modern School in Barking before leaving at the age of 15. He worked for the London Electricity Board as an office boy before starting his National Service at age 18 in the Royal Air Force as a wireless operator, during which time he served in Iraq. Conversion and ordination Carey became a committed Christian at age 17 when he attended a church service with some friends. He said that \\"I had a conversion experience which was very real ... There were no blinding lights, simply a quiet conviction I had found something.\\" During his National Service, Carey decided to seek ordination and after his discharge he studied intensely, gaining six O-levels and three A-levels in 15 months. He studied at King's College London and was awarded Bachelor of Divinity from University of London in 1962 with a 2:1 and was subsequently ordained. He later obtained a Master of Theology degree and a Ph.D. from the University of Durham. Carey is the first Archbishop of Canterbury in modern times not to have been a graduate of either the University of Oxford or the University of Cambridge. The last Archbishop of Canterbury prior to Carey who was not a graduate of Oxford or Cambridge was Simon Sudbury ( 1316‚Äì1381). Offices Carey was a curate at St Mary's Islington, worked at Oak Hill Theological College and St John's Theological College, Nottingham and became Vicar of St Nicholas' Church, Durham in 1975. Within two years he had trebled the congregation. He later wrote a book on his experiences there called The Church in the Market Place. In 1981, Carey was appointed Principal of Trinity College, Bristol. He became Bishop of Bath and Wells in 1987; he was consecrated a bishop by Robert Runcie, Archbishop of Canterbury, at Southwark Cathedral on 3 December 1987 (by which point his election must have been confirmed) and enthroned in February 1988.Buchanan, Colin. Historical Dictionary of Anglicanism p. 81 (Google Books; accessed 7 May 2014) When Robert Runcie retired as Archbishop of Canterbury, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, encouraged by her former Parliamentary Private Secretary, Michael Alison MP, put Carey's name forward to the Queen for appointment. The religious correspondent for The Times, Clifford Longley, commented that \\"Mrs Thatcher's known impatience with theological and moral woolliness ... will have been a factor.\\"John Campbell, Margaret Thatcher. The Iron Lady (Jonathan Cape, 2003), p. 394. Carey was confirmed as Archbishop of Canterbury on 27 March 1991Lambeth Palace Library Research Guide ‚Äì Places of Confirmation of Election of Archbishops of Canterbury (Accessed 7 May 2014) and enthroned on 19 April 1991. On 31 October 2002, he retired, resigning the See of Canterbury, and was created the next day a crossbench life peer as Baron Carey of Clifton, of Clifton in the City and County of Bristol. He was succeeded by Rowan Williams. Living in the Diocese of Oxford, he served there until 2017 as an honorary assistant bishop, as is customary for retired bishops. Carey was Chancellor of the University of Gloucestershire for seven years, resigning in 2010, and was president of the London School of Theology. He is also an Honorary Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Scriveners and a Distinguished Fellow of the Library of Congress (Washington DC). Theological and social positions Carey's theological roots are in the Evangelical tradition of the Church of England. He strongly supported the ordination of women but also has close ecumenical links with the Roman Catholic Church, being chosen in 1976 to represent the Church of England at a meeting of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity in Rome. Carey is tolerant of divorce and divorced people and the remarriage of divorced people. One of his sons is divorced and he also supported the marriage of the Prince of Wales to Camilla Parker-Bowles, whose first husband is living. He opposed homosexual relationships among members of the clergy, although he admits to having consecrated two bishops whom he suspected of having same-sex partners. He presided over the Lambeth Conference of 1998 and actively supported the conference's resolution which uncompromisingly rejected all homosexual practice as \\"incompatible with scripture\\". Carey was criticised for his lack of neutrality on the issue of homosexuality by those attempting to reach a compromise position which had been presented to the conference by a working group of bishops on human sexuality. Carey also voted against an expressed condemnation (which had been present in the original form of the resolution) of homophobia. The resolution as a whole prompted one of Carey's fellow primates, Richard Holloway, Bishop of Edinburgh and Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church, to declare \\"I feel gutted, I feel betrayed, but the struggle will go on\\". Carey said: \\"If this conference is known by what we have said about homosexuality, then we will have failed.\\" The resolution, however, was the beginning of an escalating crisis of unity within the Anglican Communion around the question of human sexuality, a crisis that continues. This resolution is at the heart of current divisions within the Anglican Communion on the issue. In 1999 he was one of four English bishops who expressly declined to sign the Cambridge Accord: an attempt to find agreement on affirming certain human rights of homosexuals, notwithstanding differences within the church on the morality of homosexual behaviour. In an interview with Sir David Frost in 2002 he said: \\"I don't believe in blessing same-sex relationships because frankly I don't know what I'm blessing.\\" Carey was the first former Archbishop of Canterbury to publish his memoirs, in 2004. The book, Know the Truth, mentions meetings with the Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker Bowles and his thoughts that they should marry. In 2005, they did marry in a civil ceremony; the Church carried out a blessing after civil marriage at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. In 1998 he made a public call for the humane treatment of Augusto Pinochet, the former dictator of Chile, who was at the time in custody in the United Kingdom.Colin Brown, \\"Straw may release Pinochet\\", The Independent (London), 23 Octoctober 1998. FindArticles.com. 12 September 2006.The Sunday Times, 31 October 1999, \\"Carey pleads for Pinochet to be released\\". from a Pinochet watch website Retrieved on 12 September 2006. In 2000 Carey was critical of the document Dominus Iesus, issued by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith under Pope John Paul II, saying that it \\"did not reflect the deep comprehension that has been reached through ecumenical dialogue and cooperation [between Roman Catholics and Anglicans] during the past 30 years ... the Church of England and the worldwide Anglican Communion does not for one moment accept that its orders of ministry and Eucharist are deficient in any way. It believes itself to be a part of the one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church of Christ, in whose name it serves and bears witness, here and round the world.\\" Public statements since retirement=On Muslims As Archbishop of Canterbury, Carey was active in inter-faith work and worked for better relations with Muslims, calling for \\"deeper dialogue\\" between the two faiths. On 25 March 2004, after his retirement, he made a speech lamenting the lack of democracy and innovation in Muslim countries, suggesting a lack of critical scholarship toward the Qur'an and saying that moderate Muslims should \\"resist strongly\\" the take-over of Islam by extremists. He also criticised the majority of Muslims, who do not support extremists, for not denouncing them. Some viewed his speech as an outspoken attack on Islam; Carey responded: \\"Those who took the trouble to read my lecture will have noted that I was as critical of the West, of Christianity and, for that matter, also sharply critical of Israel's policy with respect to Palestine.\\" In September 2006, he backed Pope Benedict XVI in the controversy over his comments on Islam and declared that \\"there will be no significant material and economic progress [in Muslim communities] until the Muslim mind is allowed to challenge the status quo of Muslim conventions and even their most cherished shibboleths.\\" On the British and migration Carey wrote an opinion piece in The Times on 10 September 2008 (p. 26) in which he said: \\"Immigration must be kept under control if we are to retain the essentials of British society that have been built up over the generations. ... If this scale of immigration continues, with people of different faiths, cultures and traditions coming here, what will it mean to be British?\\" In January 2010, Carey gave an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, in which he said as part of the Balanced Migration Groupwww.balancedmigration.com he would want to start a debate on the UK's migration policy. He said that while the UK migration policy should not \\"give preference to any particular group\\", the points-based immigration system should give preferences to certain prospective migrants based on their values and backgrounds. In the same interview, however, he states that he was worried that the UK will become less of a Christian country and that he believes migration policy should foster the preservation of the Christian heritage of the United Kingdom. On Syriac Christians On 18 July 2015, he lent his name and efforts to the Barnabas Fund, a charity designed to place Syriac Christians, whom ISIS target as part of their Islamic supremacist doctrine, at the front of the UK refugee queue. He called on government to ‚Äúwelcome Christian refugees and give them priority as asylum seekers. Syrian and Iraqi Christians are being butchered, tortured and enslaved. We need the British Government to work with charities like the Barnabas Fund and others to evacuate those who are in desperate fear of their lives.\\" He was joined by Lord Weidenfeld and the Vicar of Baghdad, as well as many others, in his effort.telegraph.co.uk: \\"UK is denying refuge to Christians fleeing Isil, say church leaders\\", 18 July 2015 On marriage In February 2012, speaking at the launch of the advocacy group Coalition for Marriage, Carey voiced his opposition to the government's proposal to legalise same-sex marriage, stating that he was \\"worried and disappointed\\" and calling the proposal \\"cultural vandalism\\". In March 2013, Carey spoke of being \\"very suspicious\\" that behind plans for gay marriage \\"there lurks an aggressive secularist and relativist approach towards an institution that has glued society\\". In May 2013, Carey claimed same-sex marriage could set a \\"dangerous precedent\\" which could lead to sibling marriage or polygamy. Carey criticized the British government for seeking to change the definition of marriage to \\"a long-term commitment between two people of any sex, in which gender and procreation are irrelevant\\". On homosexuality In 1994 Carey voted in the House of Lords to defeat equality legislation that would have lowered the age of consent for homosexual men, from 21 years, to the same age as for heterosexuals (16 years) and again, in 1998 he voted against the equalisation of age of consent, at that time 18, to 16. Since his retirement, Carey has tolerated same-sex partnerships in secular law but continues to oppose same- sex marriage and church blessings of same-sex partnerships. In March 2006, he personally endorsed \\"with enthusiasm\\" a questionnaire to American bishops from what he described as \\"Lay Episcopalians who wish their Church to remain faithful to Orthodox Christianity\\" in relation to the controversy in that church over the ordination of an openly gay bishop. For this, he was chided by Frank Griswold, the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States, \\"for allowing himself to be used by others whose political ambition is to sow division\\". In late April 2006, Carey said in a televised interview that the ordination of Bishop Gene Robinson of New Hampshire, US in 2003 verged on heresy because Bishop Robinson is gay and lives in a long-term relationship. His association with Episcopalians Concerned agitated some, and his decision to confirm anti-gay dissidents who refused the ministry of the Bishop of Virginia puzzled the same people. Carey, who remembered the difficulties of the 13th Lambeth Conference that he had presided over in 1998, sought to avoid a major schism in the communion by refraining from further consecrations of gay people.ekklesia.co.uk: \\"Lord Carey says ordaining a gay bishop verges on heresy\\", 27 April 2006 In April 2010, Carey submitted a witness statement to an appeal court considering the dismissal of a relationship counsellor who had refused to work with homosexuals, in which he suggested that intervention by senior clerics, including himself, was \\"indicative of a future civil unrest\\". In the same statement, he suggested that cases engaging religious rights should not be heard by any of the judges who had decided the previous cases, \\"as they have made clear their lack of knowledge about the Christian faith.\\" His submission was rejected by the Court as \\"misplaced\\" and \\"deeply inimical to the public interest\\". Carey's position was widely criticised in the press. Andrew Brown, writing in The Guardian, suggested that the effect of the judgment was to say that Carey was \\"a self-important and alarmist twit who has no idea what he is talking about\\". The Church Times commented that \\"One might be forgiven for thinking that Lord Carey of Clifton has generated more column- inches since retiring as Archbishop of Canterbury than he did when in office. His latest foray into the nation‚Äôs media is more than usually regrettable, as it strikes at the heart of the independence of the judiciary.\\" However, his position was supported by his former colleague, the retired Bishop of Rochester, Michael Nazir Ali. On religious freedom Carey was a leading advocate for the rights of Christians in advance of a case on religious freedom, begun on 4 September 2012 at the European Court of Human Rights, regarding the case of two workers forced out of their jobs over the wearing of crosses as a visible manifestation of their faith. On assisted suicide In July 2014 he announced that he had changed his view on euthanasia in favour of the legalisation of assisted dying for terminally-ill patients.https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/12/archbishop- canterbury-carey-support-assisted-dying-proposal On Anglican unity In April 2006, when criticism of his post-retirement activism on a number of fronts had been voiced in an open letter by liberal laypersons in the church,The Guardian (London), \\"Lord Carey hits back at critics' open letter\\", 24 April 2006 he issued a public statement complaining that such comments were \\"mischievous and damaging to the Anglican Communion\\". In an interview for the BBC, on 23 April 2006, he said \\"I think this is a mischievous letter from Australia and I hope the authors will reflect and repent.\\" In May 2006, he made a speech to the Virginia Theological Seminary, subsequently published on his personal website, which said \\"When I left office at the end of 2002 I felt the Anglican Communion was in good heart\\" but that, as a result of subsequent events \\"it is difficult to say in what way we are now a Communion.\\" This was reported on 11 June 2006 in the Sunday Telegraph (\\"Church has fallen apart since I was in charge, says Carey\\") and on 12 June 2006 in The Guardian and The Independent as an attack on his successor. An email from Carey on the day of publication was circulated in which he strongly denied this and said \\"I am hopping mad and will want a retraction from the Sunday Telegraph, otherwise I will lodge a complaint.\\" In November 2006, Carey was barred from delivering a Church Mission Society lecture at Bangor Cathedral by the Dean of Bangor, who viewed that Carey had become \\"a factor of disunity and of disloyalty to Rowan Williams, a divisive force.\\" On ecumenical matters In October 2009, Carey said it was inexcusable that the Vatican gave a relatively short notice of its offer to receive some Anglo-Catholics into the Roman Catholic Church within a personal ordinariate, but he nonetheless gave a cautious welcome to the offer. On matters of trade In February 2006, Carey attracted more controversy by declaring in a letter to The Times that a General Synod motion supported by his successor, Rowan Williams, in favour of disinvestment in a company active in the occupied territories of Israel made him ashamed to be an Anglican. In September 2009, Carey provoked outrage among some Anglicans by making positive remarks about the arms trade. He was quickly condemned by a number of Christian activists, particularly since the Lambeth Conferences in 1988 and 1998 had resolved to oppose the arms trade. Sex abuser Bishop Peter Ball During Carey's term as Archbishop of Canterbury there were many complaints of serial sex abuse made against Peter Ball, the bishop of Lewes and later of Gloucester until his resignation in 1993 after admitting to an act of gross indecency. Archbishop Carey wrote to the director of public prosecutions and the chief constable of Gloucester police, supporting Ball and saying that he was suffering \\"excruciating pain and spiritual torment\\". In October 2015 Ball was sentenced to 32 months' imprisonment for misconduct in public office and indecent assault; he admitted the abuse of 18 young men aged 17‚Äì25. Justin Welby, who became Archbishop of Canterbury in 2013, commissioned an independent review by Moira Gibb in February 2016 to deal with the systematic failing of the Church in handling Ball's case. In a statement submitted by Carey to pre-trial hearings regarding Ball, Carey said: \\"I was worried that if any other allegations were made it would reignite a police investigation. I was told quite categorically that any past indecency matters would not be taken further.\\" Carey said the senior CPS official told him: \\"As far as we are concerned he has resigned. He is out of it. We are not going to take anything any further.\\" He has repeatedly asserted that he was not trying to influence the outcome of the investigation. On 22 October 2016 The Daily Telegraph reported that Carey accepted that he deserved criticism over his support of Peter Ball. Carey had requested that his, rather than the Church's, lawyers should represent him at the government's Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse where Carey had been granted \\"core participation\\" status, with the Church of England paying for the lawyers. Gibb's June 2017 report, \\"An Abuse of Faith\\", found that Carey was part of a cover-up that shielded Bishop Ball from prosecution. The review found that Carey had received seven letters from families and individuals following Ball's arrest in 1992, but passed only one (the least disturbing) to the police. Carey did not add Ball to the Church of England's \\"Lambeth List\\" which names clergy about whom questions of suitability for ministry have been raised, provided Ball with funds, and wrote to Ball's brother Bishop Michael Ball in 1993, saying \\"I believed him to be basically innocent\\". Graham Sawyer, who survived abuse by Peter Ball, wants the police to investigate Carey's role in the Ball affair.Justin Welby asks George Carey to quit over church abuse reportChurch 'colluded' with sex abuse bishop Peter BallFlaming June proves a harsh month for Church of England Following production of the report, with its finding that he had covered up sex abuse allegations against bishop Peter Ball, Carey stated that the report made \\"deeply uncomfortable reading\\" and apologised to Ball's victims. Welby asked Carey to step down as an assistant bishop in the Church of England. On 26 June, having spoken to the Bishop of Oxford, Carey resigned from his post as an honorary assistant bishop within the Diocese of Oxford, his last formal role in the church. However, Carey did not resign his orders, nor his seat in the House of Lords, nor has he faced any formal ecclesiastical sanctions. Family Carey married Eileen Harmsworth Hood in 1960.

The Great Wall (also called Coma Wall), sometimes specifically referred to as the CfA2 Great Wall, is an immense galaxy filament. It is one of the largest known superstructures in the observable universe. This structure was discovered c. 1989 by a team of American astronomers led by Margaret J. Geller and John Huchra while analyzing data gathered by the second CfA Redshift Survey of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA). Characteristics The CfA2 Great Wall is a galaxy wall, one of the three subtypes of galaxy filaments, the other two being galaxy sheets and supercluster complexes. The term \\"Great\\" has been added to distinguish it as an even larger type compared to standard galaxy walls. Great walls are so rare that only five and possibly six (if the disputed Hercules- Corona Borealis Great Wall is counted) of them have been discovered to date. The CfA2 Great Wall has the maximum dimensions of either 500 million or 750 million light years depending on the figure and the reference used. It is 200 million light years in width and about 16 million light years in thickness. Its nearest point is about 300 million light years from Earth, while its farthest point is 550 million light years away. It consists of three massive galaxy superclusters: Hercules, Coma, and Leo. The CfA2 Great Wall includes Coma Filament. Components It was discovered in 1989 by Margaret Geller and John Huchra based on redshift survey data from the CfA Redshift Survey. It is not known how much farther the wall extends due to the light absorption in the plane of the Milky Way galaxy in which Earth is located. The gas and dust from the Milky Way (known as the Zone of Avoidance) obscure the view of astronomers and have so far made it impossible to determine if the wall ends or continues on further than they can currently observe. In the standard model of the evolution of the universe, such structures as the Great Wall form along and follow web-like strings of dark matter. It is thought that this dark matter dictates the structure of the Universe on the grandest of scales. Dark matter gravitationally attracts baryonic matter, and it is this \\"normal\\" matter that astronomers see forming long, thin walls of super-galactic clusters.

It was founded in 1919 by Robert C. Lawson. The church's mission statement is: \\"To evangelize the world for Jesus Christ; to equip every believer to become true Disciples of Christ; and to engage those social problems that challenge the communities we have been called to serve.\\" History The \\"Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ\\", as it is most commonly known, was organized by Robert C. Lawson, a prot√©g√© of G.T. Haywood, who claimed salvation and the baptism of the Holy Ghost in 1913. In 1914 Lawson was called to the ministry and soon began evangelizing, mainly in the Mid-West, and pastoring in Columbus, Ohio. When he found himself at odds with the leadership of the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World, Lawson resigned from that organization in 1919 and moved to New York City, where he founded the Refuge Church of Christ, after the members of a prayer band in Harlem welcomed him and turned their meetings over to him. That small church grew and became known as the Refuge Temple, and, later, the Greater Refuge Temple. It was the hub of Lawson's evangelistic efforts in the Northeast. Lawson's field work took him up and down the East Coast, throughout the West Indies, and as far as West Africa, where he appointed missionaries to carry on spiritual work. The Greater Refuge Temple in Harlem, New York City is the Church's headquarters. It was founded by Lawson in 1919 and worshipped in two other locations before moving to this building, a former casino and theater, in 1945. The facade was added in 1966., p.92 The Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ has been very influential among African-American Pentecostal churches, and has given rise to several spin-off bodies. The first major break-away was in 1930, when Sherrod C. Johnson created a rival organization, the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ of the Apostolic Faith, through which he challenged Lawson's stance on practical holiness. The most important fracture in the church's history, though, came in 1957 when Smallwood E. Williams led about 70 churches away to form the Bible Way Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ. Other organizations that were born from or splintered from this church body include the Church of God in Christ Jesus International Ministries, Progressive Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Refuge Temple Assembly of Yahweh, the Evangelistic Churches of Christ, a host of small organizations, and independent churches of varying sizes. Furthermore, there have been splits in many of the offshoot churches: for example, the church founded by Sherrod C. Johnson (Church of the Lord Jesus Christ of the Apostolic Faith, also referred to as CLJC) has splintered and re-emerged as the Holy Temple Church of the Lord Jesus Christ of the Apostolic Faith, the Apostolic Ministries of America, and the First Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ, all of which are actively evangelizing North America, the Caribbean, Europe, and West Africa. Thus, the Church of our Lord Jesus Christ is the mother of a family of predominantly African-American Pentecostal Apostolic organizations. After Lawson's death in 1961, a rising minister in the organization, William L. Bonner, proposed a change in the church's governmental structure. Whereas Bishop Lawson, as founder, had been the sole governing prelate of the organization, Bonner suggested that there be a board of archbishops, or \\"apostles\\", who would govern the churches. Two other groups, the Board of Bishops and the Board of Presbyters, both hold accountable and are held accountable by the Board of Apostles. The Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ has many other auxiliaries that function to serve its members and those of the community. The International Armor Bearers' Young Peoples' Union (ABYPU), the International Sunday School Department, the International Missionaries, and the International Congress are a few that work together to bring the ministry to laymen and surrounding communities.  Doctrine and practice  The Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ is, historically and doctrinally, a Oneness Pentecostal organization like the United Pentecostal Church and the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World. With roots in the earliest years of the American Pentecostalism, much of the culture of the church reflects the doctrine of the Holiness movement of the 1800s. Among the practices that separate it from other Pentecostal churches are its outspokenness on the significance of the name \\"Lord Jesus Christ\\", especially as a baptismal formula; a very conservative dress code, which includes the wearing of hats or some other type of headcovering (e.g., prayer veil) by women during church services; insistence on wine to be used during communion; strict interpretation of New Testament scriptures concerning divorce and remarriage; and the disallowance of women as pastors. (These last two were Lawson's points of disagreement with the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World.) Organization and membership Governance of the church includes the Chief Apostle, the Presiding Apostle, the Board of Apostles, the Board of Bishops, the Board of Presbyters, the Executive Secretary, and the General Council. Major laity-driven auxiliaries are Women's Council; Ministers' and Deacons' Wives' Guild; the International Sunday School Association and the Armor Bearers' Young People's Union, which together make up the International Congress; and the International Music Department. Though women are not ordained, they are licensed as social, senior, and field Missionaries through the organization's International Missionary Department. There is also a Deacon's Union. In 1990 the church had about 30,000 members in 450 churches in the United States. In 2008, there are now 582 churches worldwide, including congregations in West Africa, Mexico, Canada, the British West Indies, the Dominican Republic, England, Haiti, and the Philippines. Its U.S. membership is predominantly African-American. Headquartered at Greater Refuge Temple Church in Harlem, New York City, the church operates W. L.

It was founded by Lucas Mangope, leader of the Bophuthatswana bantustan in 1997, as a successor to the Tswana National Party, and led by him for the first fifteen years of its existence. Mavis Matladi was elected as its leader on 29 January 2011 after the expulsion of Mangope. Matladi died in December 2011. Isaac Sipho Mfundisi was elected president on Saturday, 7 January 2012. Most of the party's support comes from the North West province (where the old Bophuthatswana was located), and it has very little presence elsewhere in the country. The UCDP was the official opposition to the African National Congress in the North West province in 1999 and 2004, but slipped to 4th in the provincial legislature in 2009, and lost all of its seats in the provincial legislature in 2014. In the 2009 elections, the party won 66,086 votes (0.37% of the national total), and 2 seats in Parliament, representing a loss of approximately 50% of its support, and 1 seat, from the preceding elections. In the provincial elections, their support dropped from 8.49% and 3 seats in the 2004 North West provincial election, to 5,27% and 2 seats in 2009. In 2009, in six of the other provinces, they gained less than 0.1% support. In the 2014 elections, the party slumped further, losing all of its provincial and national seats. The party's mission statement stresses the need for Christian values, non-racial democracy, and government inducements for personal self-reliance, while the 2004 manifesto attacked the ANC for, among other things, its alleged softness on crime, nepotism, and neglect of South African infrastructure. A 2003 survey conducted by the Human Sciences Research Council found that 85% of UCDP voters were female.  Election results = National elections  - ! Election ! Total votes ! Share of vote !

TGP sites consist of categorized lists (more often tables) of small pictures (called \\"thumbnails\\") linked to full-size images or redirected to another website. Sites containing thumbs that lead to galleries with video content are called movie gallery posts (MGP). The main benefit of TGP/MGP is that the surfer can browse through the thumbnails to get an impression of the content provided by a gallery without actually visiting it, saving on broadband usage. However, TGP sites are open to abuse, with the most abusive form being ‚Äúcircle jerk‚Äù TGP sites (CJ), that contain links that misdirect surfers to sites they did not wish to see. Many TGP sites are free to users, but commonly are ad-driven. In affiliate marketing terms, TGPs are the affiliates that drive new traffic to the product producers, paysites. Paysites offer free hosted galleries (FHGs) in an effort to attract paying customers, and it is these FHGs, as well as chains of TGPs, that a TGP links to.  Traffic trading and TGP scripts TGPs employ a variety of schemes to trade traffic with other TGPs; signing up for these trades is usually easy and free for other TGP owners. Perhaps the most basic trade is to link to other TGP sites. These trades are reciprocal: by looking at the referrer header of the HTTP requests, a TGP owner knows where their traffic comes from; a site that doesn't provide enough visitors will be excluded from further trades. Both of these traffic trade schemes are therefore susceptible to cheating: a trader can use so-called hitbots to create bogus traffic from his site to another, in order to get good traffic in return. Scripts that automate the maintenance of a TGP, manage traffic trades and protect against hitbots are readily available. Some of these are even free, financed by an occasional redirecting of surfers to a site under the control of the script's programmer, or by advertisements directed at other webmasters on the gallery submission and traffic trade pages. TGP2 The success of the TGP format forced some adult webmasters to rethink their role in promotion of commercial sites. Some webmasters believe that TGPs saturate the Internet with free pornography. A new format for organizing previews was tried. This format, named TGP2, limits the exposure of the surfer to free content in many ways. For example, no more than 12 thumbnails are allowed per page, of which only 5 can link to images (and not directly, but to pages with images and ads) and the rest must link to signup pages. Per the standard, TGP2 galleries only include softcore images and may not link to TGP sites. Most TGP sites do not allow TGP2 galleries to be listed. The concept received little approval among web surfers and high traffic levels were never achieved. Fake TGPs Some websites appear to be TGPs, yet all or most of the featured galleries belong to the same webmaster and promote a limited selection of commercial websites. Such fake TGPs often contain links to other fake TGP sites owned by the same group or individual. Paysite owners produce and host ready-made galleries known as free hosted galleries for use on these fake TGPs. Many sponsors also provide webmasters with TGP templates which feature rotating galleries of the sponsor's sites. All a webmaster has to do is link the site using their referral code and surfers are provided with freshly updated content (often changing with each reload). Circle jerk (CJ) TGP These sites look like TGP sites but end up sending users on a 'circle jerk' of blind links. When users click on a gallery link provided by a TGP, they will be unwillingly redirected to another TGP instead. Many legitimate TGPs do this to some extent, either by having some links redirect to other TGPs, or by having all links do so a certain percentage of the time. CJ TGPs almost never have any real content. The method of earnings for these sites are selling large volumes of traffic, non-adult sponsors (who sell virus protection, adware scanning, privacy protection, web history cleaning software) and adult sponsors. Security concerns while browsing CJ sites Many CJs attempt to trap the hapless viewer by resizing the browser window, opening new windows or installing spyware, adware or dialers (for instance by having the user download a trojan horse fake codec such as Trojan.Emcodec.E or exploiting browser bugs), changing the home page and adding bookmarks. It is therefore advisable to visit these sites only when Java, ActiveX and JavaScript as well as other scripting languages have been disabled in the browser and the system is fully patched. Users who are infected with potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) and other malicious software usually end up with a variety of issues, like modified host files, endless popup ads (originating from the user's own computer) browser redirects, etc. ReferencesSee also * Fusker software Category:Erotica and pornography websites ","title":"Thumbnail gallery post"},{"id":"435552","text":"The Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU) was a political party in Kenya. It was founded in 1960 when several leading politicians refused to join Jomo Kenyatta's Kenya African National Union (KANU). It was led by Ronald Ngala who was joined by Moi's Kalenjin Political Alliance, the Masai United Front, the Kenya African Peoples Party, the Coast African Political Union,Masinde Muliro's Baluhya Political Union and the Somali National Front. The separate tribal organisations were to retain their identity and so, from the very start, KADU based its political approach on tribalism.. KADU's aim was to defend the interests of the so-called KAMATUSA (an acronym for Kalenjin, Maasai, Turkana and Samburu ethnic groups) as well as the British settlers, against the imagined future dominance of the larger Luo and Kikuyu that comprised the majority of KANU's membership, when it became inevitable that Kenya will achieve its independence. The KADU objective was to work towards a multiracial self government within the existing colonial political system. After release of Jomo Kenyatta,KADU was becoming increasingly popular with European settlers and, on the whole, repudiated Kenyatta's leadership. KADU's plan at Lancaster meetings was devised by European supporters, essentially to protect prevailing British settlers land rights. History In 1953 Kenya African Union, KAU was banned and its leaders, the Kapenguria Six imprisoned by the colonial authorities. The colonial authorities could not conceive of any political opposition to their policies, nor could they accept the reality of African aspirations strongly advocated by Jomo Kenyatta, Dedan Kimathi and other African leaders However, Mau Mau insurgency,though defeated in 1956 led to changes in the way the colony was governed and a new constitution was inaugurated in 1954.Under the new constitution of 1954,it was believed that any solution to the African problems lay in the initiative of the colonial administration under European leadership, not in changing the political system as Africans had demanded under the banned KAU. To ensure no national African political movement arises to unite Africans and threaten colonial government, national political parties were banned in 1955. The colonial authorities instead promoted the idea of regional moderate tribal political parties all over the country other than in central Kenya where the political party ban remained until 1960.Regional moderate 'kingpins' subsequently emerged with their regional political parties. These included Daniel Moi, Masinde Muliro and Ronald Ngala. Majority of these regional leaders had been elected to the LegCo in 1957 general elections. Ronald Ngala brought all these regional outfits together to form KADU when Jomo Kenyatta was released from prison in 1961 and made the president of the newly formed KANU KADU lost to KANU in the first general elections in Kenya in 1963, where it had campaigned on a platform of Majimboism, multiracial nation with white minority rule under the principles established in the Lyttelton Constitution of 1954. KANU on the other hand had campaigned on total independence of Kenya under African majority rule with a new independence constitution. KADU delegation at Kenya's Lancaster house constitutional conference negotiated for and got federalism(Majimbo) adopted into Kenya's independence constitution. In the Lancaster House Conference attended by Kenyatta, KADU's plan was strongly supported, not just by the Europeans but also by the British government. In the end, KANU abandoned its own plan and accepted a British version of the KADU plan, providing for a bicameral legislature and for eight 'jimbos' with regional presidents. Dissolution KADU dissolved in 1964 and merged with KANU under the great persuasive abilities of Tom Mboya upon the KADU leadership. Daniel arap Moi, who later served as President of Kenya, was KADU's chairman and attended the Lancaster House Conferences with Ronald Ngala. Part of the KADU team was also Masinde Muliro who believed that the dominance of the two tribes needed to be neutralized so as to have a free and fairly led nation. The dissolution of KADU was orchestrated by the then justice and legal affairs minister Tom Mboya,first Secretary General and a founding member of KANU, who followed orders from the then President of Kenya, the late Mzee Jomo Kenyatta.

According to contemporary sources, he was forced to supplicate himself on his knees waiting for three days and three nights before the entrance gate of the castle, while a blizzard raged. Indeed, the episode has been described as \\"one of the most dramatic moments of the Middle Ages\\". It has also spurred much debate among medieval chroniclers as well as modern historians, who argue about whether the walk was a \\"brilliant masterstroke\\" or an embarrassing humiliation.  Historical background  The Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor had disputed over the precedence of ecclesiastical or secular power since the spread of the Gregorian Reforms in the 11th century. When Gregory VII, acclaimed Pope by the people of Rome in 1073, attempted to enact reforms to the investiture process by his Dictatus papae decree, he was met by resistance from Henry IV. The king insisted that he reserve the traditionally established right of previous emperors to \\"invest\\" bishops, abbots and other clergymen, despite the papal decree. The conflict became increasingly severe, after Henry had been able to suppress the Saxon Rebellion in the Battle of Langensalza in June 1075. In September he installed a new Bishop of Milan, which annoyed Gregory, who openly required obedience. Shortly afterwards the Pope became the target of an assassination attempt during the 1075 Christmas celebrations. On 24 January 1076, Henry assembled several German bishops in a synod at Worms, where the ecclesiastical dignitaries abandoned all commitments to the Pope. The king finally demanded Gregory's abdication, referring to the rules of papal election according to the In nomine Domini bull of 1059. In response, Gregory excommunicated and deposed Henry in the Lenten synod of 1076 at Rome. He stated furthermore that, one year from that day, the loss of kingship would become irrevocable.Conflict of Investitures From New Advent  Journey  Henry asks Matilda and Abbot Hugh of Cluny to intervene in the dispute, Vita Mathildis () Gregory had also declared the oaths of allegiance sworn by the Princes null and void,Holland, Tom. \\"Canossa: a Medieval clash between Church and State\\", History Magazine.

When in October the Patriarch of Aquileia and the papal legate met with German princes at Trebur, they swore an oath not to recognize Henry unless the ban was lifted within a year. Fearing further rebellion among the German aristocracy, Henry felt he had to get rid of his excommunication. He was still popular among the common people, but the princes were threatening to elect a new king. He had to secure his position in the church before the rapidly approaching deadline given by the pope. On the suggestion of his adversaries, he arranged to meet with the Pope, who had set out along the path across the Alps towards Augsburg. Henry commenced his trip in Speyer and, travelling southward down the Rhine, he found his position precarious. As the Swabian nobles refused to open the way to the Alpine passes, the king had to move through Burgundy and cross the Alps at steep Mont Cenis.; *[https://storicamente.org/creber-women-canossa Creber, ‚ÄòWomen at Canossa'.

After a long journey, they reached Gregory's accommodation in Canossa on 25 January 1077.  At the castle  Henry IV and his entourage at the gate, 19th century depiction When Henry reached Matilda's castle, the Pope ordered that he be refused entry. Waiting at the gates, Henry took on the behavior of penance. He wore a hair- shirt, the traditional clothing of monks at the time, and allegedly walked barefoot. Many of his entourage, including the queen Bertha of Savoy and the prince Conrad, also supposedly removed their shoes. According to Lambert of Hersfeld and first-hand accounts of the scene (letters written by both Gregory and Henry in the following years), the king waited by the gate for three full days. Throughout this time, he allegedly wore only his penitent hair-shirt and fasted.Account of Canossa From An Account of Canossa Finally, on 28 January, the castle gates were opened for Henry and he was allowed to enter. Contemporary accounts report that he knelt before Pope Gregory and begged his forgiveness. Gregory absolved Henry and invited him back into the Church. That evening, Gregory, Henry, and Matilda of Tuscany shared communion in the chapel of Sant'Apollonio inside the castle, signaling the official end of Henry's excommunication.This series of events is compiled by Zimmerman (see below) as the most likely, through comparison of original sources on the subject, including letters written by both Henry and Gregory to the German bishops and princes. For a discussion of this, and for other proposed time lines, see Zimmermann's chapter 5 Whether Henry actually did formal repentance has not been conclusively established. In any case, he regained his freedom to act and quickly returned to Germany, while Gregory remained with Matilda at the castle and in other locations in Tuscany for several months.  Historical impact  A 1583 image of Henry at Canossa, by English Protestant John Foxe. The print depicts Henry as a dignified ruler, contrasted with Gregory's contemptuous supporters and Gregory himself, identified as Antichrist, who is depicted in the wiles of Matilda. The immediate effects of the Canossa meeting were limited. Although Henry was restored to the Church, any expectations that the Pope would restore support of Henry's right to the throne were soon dashed;Gregory had exacted an impossible promise that Henry would not assume imperial powers until permitted to do so by the Pope; a pro-papal chronicler referred to Henry's \\"pretended reconciliation\\" (I. S. Robinson, \\"Pope Gregory VII, the Princes and the Pactum 1077‚Äì1080\\", The English Historical Review 94 No. 373 (October 1979):721‚Äì756) p. 725. in March, a small group of powerful Saxon and South German territorial magnates, including the archbishops of Salzburg, Mainz and Magdeburg and several bishops, met at Forchheim and, on the assumption that Henry had irretrievably lost the imperial dignity, repudiated the Salian dynasty's claim to pass the imperial crown by heredity and, in the words of Bruno of Merseburg, present in his bishop's entourage, declared that \\"the son of a king, even if he should be preeminently worthy, should become king by a spontaneous election\\". The Pope confirmed the agreement.Robinson 1979:721f. His deposition still in effect, Henry was forced into civil war with Duke Rudolph of Swabia. Gregory levied a second excommunication against Henry, who ultimately won the civil war, invaded Rome, and forced Gregory to flee, replacing him with Antipope Clement III.\\"Gregory VII\\" in HistoryChannel.Com: Encyclopedia by John W. O'Malley, retrieved 11 July 2006. The meaning in the greater history of Germany and Europe, however, was much more significant. During the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, Henry was exalted as a defender of the rights of both Catholics and opponents of the Pope. Many German Lutherans considered him the \\"first Protestant\\" and looked to his example for guidance in their struggle against what they saw as a tyrannical and unjust institution. Still in 1728, when Gregory was canonized by Pope Benedict XIII, the papal decree caused offence among European monarchs and its publication was banned by Emperor Charles VI. Plaque with Bismarck's quote erected in 1877 at Harzburg Castle Later in history, the event took on a more secular meaning: the rejection of its example came to stand for Germany's refusal to be subjected to any outside power (although still especially, but not exclusively, the Catholic Church). The incident first was perpetuated by the Austrian politician and poet Anton Alexander von Auersperg (Anastasius Gr√ºn) in an 1868 speech before the House of Lords on the implementation of civil marriage. After German unification, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, when his Pulpit Paragraph and the Jesuits Law sparked the so-called \\"Kulturkampf\\" with Pope Pius IX, assured his countrymen in a Reichstag speech that \\"We will not go to Canossa‚Äìneither in body nor in spirit!\\" This meant that Germany would stand for itself and not abide any outside interference in its politics, religion or culture.For more discussion on cultural references to the Walk to Canossa, see Zimmermann, chapters 1 and 4 On the other side, Canossa is remembered in Italy by Benedetto Croce as the first concrete victory since the fall of the Western Roman Empire, as (in the view of the 19th-century historian) the Pope represented the Italian people against the domination of the Germans. Croce considered Canossa as the initial retreat from Italy of the Holy Roman Empire, starting the Italian Renaissance in which the Germans lost control of Northern Italy by the 15th century. Modern usage In modern usage, \\"going to Canossa\\" refers to an act of penance or submission. To \\"go to Canossa\\" is an expression that describes doing penance, often with the connotation that it is unwilling or coerced. For example, Adolf Hitler used the expression to describe his meetings with Bavarian Minister President Heinrich Held after being released from Landsberg Prison, in his bid to have the ban on the Nazi Party lifted.Kershaw, Ian. Hitler: 1889‚Äì1936: Hubris New York: Norton, 1998. It is used often in German (Gang nach Canossa), Dutch (naar Canossa gaan), Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish (Canossavandring or Kanossag√•ng), Finnish (ry√∂mi√§ Kanossaan), French (aller √† Canossa), Hungarian (kanosszaj√°r√°s), Italian (andare a Canossa), Slovenian (pot v Canosso) and Hebrew (◊î◊ú◊ô◊õ◊î ◊ú◊ß◊†◊ï◊°◊î - halikha le'kanossa).

Adams was a founder of the Barbados Labour Party (BLP), and he was named in 1998 as one of the National Heroes of Barbados. Early life Adams was born at Colliston, Government Hill, St. Michael, on 28 April 1898. He was the third child of seven born to Fitzherbert Adams and the former Rosa Frances Turney. Adams was educated at St. Giles and at Harrison College in Barbados. In 1918, he won the scholarship and departed the following year for his undergraduate studies at Oxford University. Adams played a single match of first-class cricket for Barbados during the 1925‚Äì26 season, as a wicket-keeper against British Guiana in the Inter-Colonial Tournament.Grantley Adams playing statistics CricketArchive; Retrieved 2 December 2014 Political career Adams‚Äô political interest began when he was still a law student in England. He became a member of the Liberal Party at Oxford, finding his views aligned best with those of the Asquithian liberals, in support of private enterprise and trade. Under the Liberal ideals of the era, support of trade union action, representational government and reform of the land ownership and taxation system were towards the overall goal of fostering free trade.F.A. Hoyos, Grantley Adams and the Social Revolution, Macmillan (1974) As the British liberals that shaped him rejected the socialism of the British Labour Party, so too did Adams oppose the labour-focused efforts of the Democratic League of Charles Duncan O'Neal and Clennell Wickham on his return to Barbados in 1925. He attacked their strike efforts as editor of the Agricultural Reporter, a planter paper that had opposed workers‚Äô rights since its nineteenth century inception. With a growing reputation and popularity among the conservative establishment, Adams‚Äô entry into the House of Assembly in 1934 was assured by his role in the deconstruction of the socialist League, including bankrupting one of the key journalistic voices in support of workers‚Äô rights.Gordon Lewis, The Growth of the Modern West Indies, New York, 1972. Nevertheless, Adams‚Äô fundamental belief in liberal policies meant that he tended to support pro- working class efforts once he was installed in the House, and continued to espouse many of O‚ÄôNeale‚Äôs causes after the man‚Äôs passing in 1936. Adams therefore consolidated his position by subsuming the fragmented Labour movement he had shattered, and marrying them to his own liberal ideals. It is this face that embraced the workers‚Äô rebellions of 1937 and lead to the establishment of the Barbados Labour Party in 1938.F.A. Hoyos, Grantley Adams and the Social Revolution, Macmillan (1974) Adams was president of the Barbados Workers' Union (BWU) from 1941 to 1954, and was involved in the lowering of the exclusive income qualification in 1942. By 1949, governmental control was wrested from the planters, and Adams became the Prime Minister of the West Indies Federation, defeating Ashford Sinanan by two votes. (Sinanan went on to serve as Leader of the Opposition of Trinidad's Democratic Labour Party.) Adams served this role from 1958 to 1962; Barbados was one of the ten provinces of the West Indies Federation, an organisation doomed by nationalistic attitudes and by the fact that its members, as British colonies, held limited legislative power. Yet he retained his reputation for conservatism through his support of the monarchy. His leaderships‚Äôs failure to form unions such as the BWU and his rejection of attempts to speed up the push for Independence was used by his opponents as evidence that he was no longer in touch with the needs of his country. Errol Walton Barrow, a fervent reformer, became the new people's advocate. Barrow had left the BLP and formed the Democratic Labour Party (DLP) as the social democrat alternative to Adams' liberal government, one that cleaved more closely to Labour‚Äôs disruptive traditions. As such, Barrow instituted many progressive social welfare focused on demolishing long-standing class barriers, including free education for all Barbadians, and the School Meals system, the latter being vehemently derided by Adams himself. By 1961, Barrow had replaced Adams as Premier and the DLP controlled the government. Personal life Adams was married to Grace Thorne in 1929 at St. John's Church. Their only child, Tom, himself won the Barbados Scholarship and attended Oxford to become a lawyer. Tom Adams was elected as Barbados' second Prime Minister in 1976. Legacy Grantley Adams International Airport, formerly Seawell Airport, located in Christ Church, Barbados, was named after the former Prime Minister in 1976. A statue in honour of Adams is located in front of Government Headquarters at Bay Street, St. Michael. Adams is one of Barbados' National Heroes. He was the father of Barbados' second Prime Minister following independence, the late J. M. G. \\"Tom\\" Adams. Adams was buried in Bridgetown, Barbados, at the churchyard of the Anglican Cathedral Church of Saint Michael and All Angels on Saint Michael's Row. The former home of Adams, located on Roebuck Street, Bridgetown, functions as the headquarters of the Barbados Labour Party political group. Adams is featured on the front of the Barbados $100 bill, popularly referred to as a \\"Grantley\\".

The film marked the feature film directorial debut of Canadian director Mary Harron. The film stars Lili Taylor as Valerie, Jared Harris as Andy Warhol, and Martha Plimpton as Valerie's friend Stevie. Stephen Dorff plays Warhol superstar Candy Darling. John Cale of The Velvet Underground wrote the film's scorehttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116594/ despite protests from former band member Lou Reed. Yo La Tengo plays an anonymous band that is somewhat reminiscent of the group. The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Teddy Awards, the film was selected to be shown at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival in February 2016. Plot The film opens immediately after the shooting at The Factory in 1968, followed by Valerie Solanas being shown in custody for shooting Andy Warhol. The film then uses flashbacks to when Valerie was living in New York as a sex worker, then to her difficult childhood, then to her success in studying psychology at college. Here, Valerie discovers that she is a lesbian, that she can write, and that she has a distinctive view of the world. This leads her to New York City and its downtown underworld. Through her friend Stevie, she meets Candy Darling, who in turn introduces her to Warhol. Valerie also meets Maurice Girodias, the publisher of Olympia Press. While Valerie wants Warhol to produce her play, Up Your Ass, Girodias wants her to write a pornographic novel for him. Once she signs a contract with Girodias, she comes to suspect his offer is not a generous one and may not be in her best interest. She comes to regret signing this contract. At this point, her increasing derangement leads her to believe that Warhol and Girodias are controlling her. The film concludes, where it began, with Solanas' attempted murder of Warhol. Warhol lives in fear that Valerie will strike again and never fully recovers from the shooting. The SCUM manifesto becomes a feminist classic.

Dr. Dana Heller, professor of English at the Old Dominion University, argues that the film stages the conflict between Solanas and Warhol as less the result of gender politics - particularly because Solanas intended no connection between her writing and the shooting - than of the decline of print culture as represented by Solanas and the rise of new non-writing media as embodied by Warhol and the Pop art movement. In the screenplay, Harron and Minahan describe Solanas as \\"banging at an ancient typewriter\\" and the film frequently shows her typing, for which she is mocked by Warhol and other Factory regulars. Solanas' writing is set against the new technologies of reproduction championed by Warhol. Many people who knew Solanas and Warhol tried to rationalize the shooting. Stephen Koch, who in 1973 wrote a study of Warhol's film, stated: \\"Valerie lives in terror of dependence: That is what the SCUM Manifesto is about, an absolute terror before the experience of need. Like Warhol, Solanas is obsessed with an image of autonomy, except that... she has played the obsession desperately, rather than with Warhol's famous cool.\\"Harron, I Shot Andy Warhol, Grove Press NY, 1995 Reception Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 75% of critics gave the film positive reviews.\\"I Shot Andy Warhol\\" at Rotten Tomatoes On Metacritic it has a weighted score of 75/100, based on 20 critics, which it ranks as \\"Generally favorable reviews\\".\\"I Shot Andy Warhol\\" at Metacritic Awards and nominationsWins= * Gij√≥n International Film Festival Best Art Direction - Th√©r√®se DePrez * Seattle International Film Festival Golden Space Needle Award for Best Actress - Lili Taylor * Stockholm Film Festival Award for Best Actress - Lili Taylor * Sundance Film Festival Special Recognition for Outstanding Performance - Lili Taylor =Nominations= * Independent Spirit Awards Best First Feature - Mary Harron, Tom Kalin, and Christine Vachon * Stockholm Film Festival Bronze Horse * Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize - Dramatic Home media I Shot Andy Warhol was released on Region 1 DVD on January 23, 2001.

Gairy also served as head of government in pre-independence Grenada as Chief Minister from 1961 to 1962, and as Premier from 1967 to 1974. Early days in Grenada: 1922‚Äì41 Eric Matthew Gairy was the son of Douglas and Theresa Gairy, and was born 18 February 1922 in Dunfermline, St. Andrew's Parish on the eastern side of the island near Grenville, Grenada. He attended the LaFillette School and then the St. Andrews Roman Catholic Senior School. He was also an acolyte at St. Andrew's Roman Catholic Church, next door to the school. He became a primary \\"student-teacher\\" in the LaFillette School from January 1939 to September 1941. He moved to Aruba where he worked several years in the oil refinery of the Lago Oil and Transport Company.Oud-ingezetenen Aruba succesvol in politiek, Amigoe, September 15, 1962 Trade union leader and \\"Red Sky\\": 1950‚Äì51 Eric Gairy returned to Grenada in December, 1949 to enter trade unionism and politics. In 1950 he founded the Grenada Manual & Mental Workers Union (GMMWU) and was deeply involved in encouraging the 1951 general strike for better working conditions. This sparked great unrest - so many buildings were set ablaze that the disturbances became known as the \\"red sky\\" days - and the British authorities had to call in military reinforcements to help regain control of the situation. Gairy himself was taken into custody. Radical political leader: 1951‚Äì61 In 1951 Gairy founded the Grenada United Labour Party. He was elected as a representative of the Colony of Grenada's Legislative Council in 1951, 1954, and 1957. He was banned from political activities and lost his seat between 1957 and 1961. Chief Minister: 1961‚Äì62 Gairy was returned in a by-election in July 1961 and became Chief minister, as his party held a majority in the Legislative Council since winning the 1961 general election. He served as Chief Minister from August 1961 until April 1962 when he was dismissed by the British colonial Governor for the questionable use of state funds. Leader of the Opposition: 1962‚Äì67 Gairy's party lost the 1962 general election and he served as leader of the opposition between 1962 and 1967. Premier: 1967‚Äì74=First administration: 1967‚Äì72 Gairy won the 1967 general election and formed a new administration as Premier of the Associated State of Grenada. Miss World controversy In the 1970 Miss World pageant in London, controversy followed after Grenadian contestant Jennifer Hosten won, and another black contestant from South Africa placed second. Since Gairy was on the judging panel, inevitably there were many accusations that the contest had been rigged. The BBC and newspapers received numerous protests about the result, and accusations of racism were made by all sides. Four of the nine judges had given first-place votes to Miss Sweden, Marjorie Christel Johansson, while Miss Grenada received only two firsts, yet Johansson finished fourth. Some of the audience gathered in the street outside Royal Albert Hall after the contest and chanted \\"Swe-den, Swe-den\\". Four days later, organising director Julia Morley (1941-) resigned because of the intense pressure from the newspapers. Years later Johansson was reported as saying that she had been cheated out of the title. Second administration 1972‚Äì74 Gairy won the 1972 general election and formed a new administration as Premier of the Associated State of Grenada.  Prime Minister: 1974‚Äì79=First administration: 1974‚Äì76 Gairy became the first Prime Minister of Grenada when Grenada achieved independence from Great Britain on 7 February 1974. Gairy's term in office coincided with civil strife in Grenada. The political environment was highly charged, with Gairy's secret police, the Mongoose Gang, terrorizing opponents. Second administration: 1976‚Äì79 Gairy's party narrowly won the 1976 election but the result was declared fraudulent by international observers due to intimidation of the opposition by Gairy's secret police, known as the Mongoose Gang. On 27 November 1978, Eric Gairy led a group including scientists and an astronaut in addressing the United Nations on the subject of UFOs. US citizens helped to support the overthrow of Eric Gairy with solidarity movements. One such solidarity movement existed in San Antonio, Texas and was headed by African-American activist Mario Marcel Salas, who was active in his overthrow on a number of levels. Civil strife took the form of street violence between government supporters, including the Mongoose Gang, and gangs organized by the New Jewel Movement (NJM). In the late 1970s, the NJM began planning to overthrow the government, with party members receiving military training outside of Grenada. In 1979, a rumour circulated that Gairy would use the Gang to eliminate leaders of the New Jewel Movement while he was out of the country. In response, Bishop overthrew Gairy in March of that year while the latter was visiting the United States. On 13 March 1979, while Gairy was at the UN, the New Jewel Movement led by Maurice Bishop launched an armed revolution and overthrew the government. Bishop suspended the constitution, and the New Jewel Movement ruled the country by decree until 1983. Anti-Gairy activity was carried out in the United States in support of the revolution to overthrow Gairy including activists in San Antonio, Texas.Political leader Mario Marcel Salas of San Antonio, who later became a city councilman and professor was involved in the overthrown of the Gairy regime (U.S. Federal court records, Washington, DC, and San Antonio Light Newspaper). Exile in the United States: 1979‚Äì83 Gairy stayed in exile in the United States until 1983, when the United States, backed by some Caribbean allies - notably, Dame Eugenia Charles, Prime Minister of Dominica - invaded to topple a military government which had overthrown and killed Bishop. Return and final days: 1983‚Äì97 Gairy then returned to Grenada and campaigned in the elections of 1984, claiming to be a changed man. However, his party lost the elections, winning 36% of the popular vote but only a single seat in the House of Representatives. Attempts by Gairy and his party to return to power in 1990 and 1995 were also unsuccessful. He died in Grand Anse, Grenada.

Bishop headed the People's Revolutionary Government of Grenada from 1979 to 1983, when he was dismissed from his post and shot during the coup by Bernard Coard, leading to upheaval.  Biography  Maurice Rupert Bishop was born on 29 May 1944 on the island of Aruba, then a colony of the Netherlands as part of the Netherlands Antilles. His parents, Rupert and Elment Bishop, came from the northeast of the British island of Grenada, where his father earned only 5 British pence per day. At the end of 1930, to improve his financial position, he moved to work in the oil refinery on the island of Aruba with his wife Elment.  Childhood and adolescence  Until the age of six, Maurice was raised in Aruba with two older sisters Anne and Moran. In 1950 his father took the family back to Grenada and opened a small retail shop in the capital, St. George's. Maurice was sent to study at the Wesleyan elementary school, but after a year transferred to the Roman Catholic St George primary and high school. At the age of nine Maurice was teased because of his height which made him look much older. As an only son, his father pushed his education and expected much of him. He expected perfect grades from him, not 95 but 100%, and when the family purchased a car his mother expected him to walk to school like the others. For his secondary education, Bishop received one of the four government scholarships for study at the Roman Catholic Presentation Brothers' College. He was elected president of the Student Council, of the Discussion Club, and of the History Study Group, along with editing the newspaper Student Voice and participating in sports. He later recalled: \\"Here I had much interest in politics, history and sociology.\\" He also established contacts with students from the Anglican Grenada Boys' Secondary School, his own school's competitors. He was an ardent supporter of the West Indies Federation established in 1958 and the ideas of Caribbean nationalism. He also recalled the great interest the 1959 Cuban Revolution aroused in him. Bishop recalled: \\"In fact, for us it did not matter what we heard on the radio or read in the colonial press. For us, it comes down to the courage and legendary heroism of Fidel Castro, Che Guevara. ...Nothing could overshadow this aspect of the Cuban Revolution.\\" In those same years Bishop and his colleagues became interested in reading the works of Julius Nyerere and Frantz Fanon. In 1962 Bishop graduated with a gold medal for his outstanding ability. Shortly before graduation, in early 1962, Bishop and youth leader from Grenada Boys' Secondary School Bernard Coard, created the Grenada Assembly of Youth Fighting for Truth, designed to bring the island youth to political life in a debate over pressing issues. Members gathered on Friday in St. George's main square and arranged open political debates among the people. Both friends and enemies celebrated his charisma and good oratory skills, including his skilful use of humor in his speeches.  Education in England  The group's activities ended nine months later when Bishop and the other Assembly leaders left to study at universities in Europe and the United States. In December 1963 the 19-year-old Maurice Bishop arrived in London to study law at the University of London, and Coard travelled to the US to study economics at Brandeis University. In London, Bishop received his Bachelori of Law at Gray's Inn in 1966. He often worked in London as a postman or vegetable packer. In 1963‚Äì66, Bishop was president of the Students Association of Holborn College and in 1967 headed the association of students of the Royal College. While studying Grenadian history, Bishop focused on anti-British speeches and Julien F√©don, the head of the 1795 uprising. In 1964 he participated the UK's West Indian Standing Conference (WISC) and Campaign Against Racial Discrimination (CARD). He travelled from the UK to socialist Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic. During this period he studied the works of Marx, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong. Bishop was particularly impressed by Julius Nyerere's Ujamaa: Essays on Socialism (published by Oxford University Press in 1968) and the Arusha Declaration of 1967. From 1967 to 1969 Bishop worked on his thesis \\"Constitutional Development of Grenada\\", but left the job because of disagreements with the supervisor in assessing the 1951 disturbances. In 1969 he received a law degree and became one of the founders of the Legal Aid Office of the West Indies community in London's Notting Hill Gate. This was volunteer work, and his main source of income came from work as an auditor of additional taxes on the British Civil Service. During this period he corresponded with friends and developed a two-year plan of activities upon his return to Grenada. The plan called for temporary withdrawal from participation in political activities and his work as a lawyer to co-create an organization capable of taking power on the island. Returning to Grenada in December 1970, Bishop gave legal defence to striking nurses at St. George's General Hospital, who hoped to improve the living conditions of patients. He was arrested along with 30 other protestors. All were acquitted after a seven-month trial. In 1972 Bishop helped organize a conference in Martinique that discussed and strategized actions for liberation movements. The philosophy of Julius Nyerere and Tanzanian socialism were guiding elements for the Movement for Assemblies of the People (MAP) which Bishop helped organize after the elections of 1972. Bishop and co-founders Kenrick Radix and Jacqueline Creft were interested in steering MAP toward construction of popular institutions centered in villages, to facilitate broad participation in the country's affairs. In January 1973 MAP merged with the Joint Endeavor for Welfare, Education, and Liberation (JEWEL) to form the New Jewel Movement (NJM). Bishop shared the leadership as Joint Coordinating Secretary with Unison Whiteman.  Grenada \\"Bloody Sunday\\"  On 18 November 1973, Bishop and other leaders of the New Jewel Movement were driving in two cars from St George's to Grenville, where they were to meet with businessmen of the city. Security forces under Assistant Chief Constable Aynesent Belmar overtook Bishop's motorcade. Nine people were captured, arrested, and beaten by the government. In prison they shaved their beards, revealing Bishop's broken jaw. These events became known in Grenada as \\"Bloody Sunday.\\"  \\"Bloody Monday\\"  Bishop joined a mass demonstration against Gairy on 21 January 1974. As his group returned to their hotel, they were pelted with stones and bottles by Gairy's supporters, and the security forces used tear gas. Rupert Bishop, Maurice's father, was leading women and children away from the danger, and was himself shot and killed at the door of the hotel. This became known in Grenada as \\"Bloody Monday.\\" After this event, Bishop noted \\"we realized that we were unable to lead the working class,\\" since the party had no influence in city workers' unions or among the rural folk loyal to Gairy. With his colleagues, he developed a new strategy, shifting focus from propaganda and mobilization for anti-government demonstrations toward organization of party groups and cells.  Strange conspiracy Independence Day  On 6 February 1974, the day before the proclamation of the independent state of Grenada, Bishop was arrested on charges of plotting an armed anti- government conspiracy and taken to the Fort George prison. Police said that while searching his house they found weapons, ammunition, equipment, and uniforms, along with a plan to assassinate Eric Gairy in a night club, and a scheme for guerrilla camps. The day after Independence day, on 8 February 1974, Bishop was released on bail and soon after went to the United States. On 29 March 1974 he participated in a meeting of the Regional Steering Committee of the Pan-African Congress in Guyana. He also continued his law practice, in October 1974 defending Desmond \\"Ras Kabinda\\" Trotter and Roy Mason who were accused of murdering an American tourist. In October 1975 he spoke at a seminar on \\"Fascism: A Caribbean Reality?\\", organized by the Oilfields Workers' Trade Union in Trinidad, and represented the Nutmeg Board as solicitor in High Court. In November 1975 the NJM Political Bureau formed a Grenada-Cuba Friendship Association, with Bishop as one of the initial leaders. In 1976, he was elected to represent St. George's South-East in Parliament. For several years he held the position of leader of the opposition in the Grenadian House of Representatives, opposing the government of Prime Minister Eric Gairy and his Grenada United Labour Party (GULP), which maintained power by terrorism and fraudulent elections. In May 1977 Bishop made his first visit to Cuba, with Unison Whiteman, as leaders of the NJM and guests of the Cuban Institute of Friendship with People (ICAP).  Premiership  Bishop in Bautzen, East Germany, 1982 In East Berlin, 1982 In 1979 Bishop's party staged a revolution and deposed Gairy, who was out of the country addressing the United Nations. Bishop became Prime Minister of Grenada and suspended the constitution. Maurice Bishop has been styled a \\"brilliant communicator\\" whose empathy for the masses was the driving force of the \\"Grenadian Revolution of 1979 that overthrew the corrupt and pro-imperialist administration of Eric Gairy.\\" Bishop established a relationship with Cuba after he took power. He initiated a number of projects, most significantly, the building of a new international airport on the island's southern tip (renamed in his memory in May 2009). Financing and labour for the construction of the airport came from Cuba, although most of the airport's infrastructure was designed by European and North American consultants. American President Ronald Reagan accused Grenada of intending to use the new airport's long \\"airstrip\\" as a waypoint for Soviet military aircraft. Fearful of the spread of socialism, Reagan - who had spurned Bishop's overtures for friendship - planned an invasion of Grenada. Among Bishop's core principles were workers' rights, women's rights, and the struggle against racism and apartheid. Under Bishop's leadership, the National Women's Organization was formed which participated in policy decisions along with other social groups. Women were given equal pay and paid maternity leave, and sex discrimination was made illegal. Organisations for education (Center for Popular Education), health care, and youth affairs (National Youth Organization) were also established. Despite its achievements, Bishop's government would not hold elections and stifled the free press and the opposition - perhaps due to fear of outside interference. The People's Revolutionary Army (PRA) was also formed during Bishop's administration. Critics claimed that the army was a waste of resources, and there were complaints that the PRA was used as a tool to commit human rights abuses, like torture and detention of political dissidents without trial. The establishment of voluntary mass organizations of women, farmers, youth, workers, and militia were presumed to make the holding of elections unnecessary. Moreover, it was believed that elections could be manipulated by the input of large sums of money from foreign interests. Bishop has been quoted at length on the dynamics of democracy: > There are those ... who believe that you cannot have a democracy unless > there is a situation where every five years ... people are allowed to put an > \\"X\\" next to some candidate's name, and ... they return to being non-people > without the right to say anything to their government, without any right to > be involved in running their country. ...Elections could be important, but > for us the question is one of timing. ...We would much rather see elections > come when the economy is more stable, when the Revolution is more > consolidated. When more people have in fact had benefits brought to them. > When more people are literate ...The right of freedom of expression can > really only be relevant if people are not too hungry, or too tired to be > able to express themselves. It can only be relevant if appropriate > grassroots mechanisms rooted in the people exist, through which the people > can effectively participate. ...We talk about the human rights that the > majority has never been able to enjoy, ... a job, to decent housing, to a > good meal. ...These human rights have been the human rights for a small > minority over the years in the Caribbean and the time has come for the > majority of the people to begin to receive those human rights for the first > time.\\" While Bishop introduced free public health, illiteracy dropped from 35% to 5% and unemployment went from 50% to 14%, his weak point was tourism. He unpacked the old project of an international airport and asked his friend Fidel Castro for help. When Bernard Coard arrested Bishop, protesters numbering 30,000 on an island of 100,000 gathered, and even the guards joined the protest, resulting in the release of Bishop. But Bishop, knowing the determination of the Coard faction, confided in a journalist: \\"I am a dead man.\\"  Arrest and execution  In 1983, disputes among the party leadership occurred. A military junta group within the party tried to make Bishop either step down or agree to a power-sharing agreement with Deputy Prime Minister Bernard Coard. Bishop rejected these proposals and was eventually deposed and placed under house arrest during the first week of October 1983 by Coard. Large public demonstrations throughout the island demanded Bishop's freedom and restoration to power. During one demonstration, the crowd freed Bishop from house arrest. First in a truck, then by car, Bishop made his way to the army headquarters at Fort Rupert (known today as Fort George). After he arrived, a military force was dispatched from Fort Frederick to Fort Rupert. Bishop and seven others, including cabinet ministers, were captured. Then a four-man People's Revolutionary Army firing squad executed Bishop, three members of his Cabinet and four others by machine-gunning them. After he was dead, a gunman slit his throat and cut off his finger to steal his ring. The bodies were then transported to a military camp and partially burned in a pit. The location of their remains is still unknown. Partly as a result of Bishop's murder, the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) and the nations of Barbados and Jamaica appealed to the United States for assistance, as did Grenada's governor-general Paul Scoon, and U.S. President Ronald Reagan launched an invasion.  Family  Maurice Bishop married nurse Angela Redhead in 1966. They had two children, Nadia (born 1969) and John (born 1971). Angela emigrated to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, with both children in 1981, while Bishop was still prime minister. He also fathered a son, Vladimir Lenin (1978‚Äì94), with his longtime partner Jacqueline Creft (1947‚Äì83), who was Grenada's Minister of Education. Creft was killed alongside Bishop at the confrontation at Fort Rupert (known as Fort George today) on 19 October 1983. After his parents' deaths, Vladimir joined his half-siblings in Canada, but was stabbed to death in a Toronto nightclub at the age of 16.  Legacy  On 29 May 2009, Grenada's international airport (formerly Point Salines International Airport) was renamed Maurice Bishop International Airport. Speaking at the ceremony, St. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said: \\"This belated honour to an outstanding Caribbean son will bring closure to a chapter of denial in Grenada's history.\\"  See also  * Grenada 17  References  External links   Category:1944 births Category:1983 deaths Category:Alumni of the London School of Economics Category:Alumni of King's College London Category:Members of Gray's Inn Category:Members of the House of Representatives of Grenada Category:Prime Ministers of Grenada Category:Executed prime ministers Category:Grenadian Marxists Category:People executed by Grenada by firing squad Category:Executed Grenadian people Category:New Jewel Movement politicians Category:International opponents of apartheid in South Africa Category:Grenadian communists Category:Anti-revisionists Category:Communist rulers Category:Communism in Grenada Category:Leaders who took power by coup Category:Leaders ousted by a coup Category:Heads of government who were later imprisoned ","title":"Maurice Bishop"},{"id":"435577","text":"Bradninch is a small town and former manor in Devon, England, lying about south of Cullompton. Much of the surrounding farmland belongs to the Duchy of Cornwall. There is an electoral ward with the same name. At the 2011 Census the ward population was 2,041. In 2012, in research of 2,400 postcodes in England and Wales which took into account 60 separate factors of interest to young families, Bradninch was found to be the fifteenth most family friendly location in the country. The town is twinned with Landunvez in Brittany. Toponymy The place-name 'Bradninch' is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as 'Bradenese'; the name is thought to mean 'broad oak'Eilert Ekwall, Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p. 58. or 'broad ash'.Illustrations of Devon's History, R.R. Sellman, p23 Seventy-nine different spellings of the name of the town have been recorded.Croslegh, Charles ‚Äì Bradninch, being a short historical sketch of the honor, the manor, the borough, and liberties, and the parish, p343 History=Anglo-Saxon Bradninch dates back to before the 7th century and at some time there was almost certainly a Norman or Anglo-Saxon fortress on Castle Hill. There are no physical remains, and no known primary documentary references, but the likely site was surrounded by a number of 'castle' field names on the tithe map. It would have been unusual for Bradninch not to have had a castle given its status in the medieval period. Norman Bradninch was the caput of the feudal barony of Bradninch granted by William the Conqueror (1066‚Äì1087) to William Capra, who is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as holding this manor. The barony escheated to the crown and King Henry I (1100‚Äì1135) granted it to his illegitimate son William I de Tracy (d.circa 1136). He left one daughter and sole-heiress Grace de Tracy who married John de Sudeley,Sanders, I.J., English Baronies, Oxford, 1960, p.20, Bradninch They had two children: Ralph de Sudeley (d. 1192), the eldest, who became his father's heir, and Sir William II \\"de Tracy\\" (d. post 1172), who inherited his mother's barony of Bradninch and assumed her family name in lieu of his patronymic. He married Hawise de Born and had a son William III de Tracy (d. pre-1194), one of the four knights who assassinated Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, in December 1170. The value of Bradninch Following the execution of King Charles I in 1649, an Act of Parliament was passed which allowed the sale of the feudal barony of Bradninch (or \\"honour of Bradninch\\") together with its caput, namely the manor of Bradninch, together with the borough of Bradninch, and on 24 March 1650 all were sold for the sum of ¬£19,517 11 shillings 10 1/4 pence to Thomas Sanders and John Gorges as trustees for the new Commonwealth. The feudal barony and manor were returned to the Dukedom of Cornwall following the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660 although the feudal element of the holding was effectively extinguished at about the same time by the Tenures Abolition Act 1660. Prince Charles, as the present Duke of Cornwall, remains the nominal lord of the manor of Bradninch, and the theoretical feudal baron of Bradninch, and continues to own much of the land within the parish. In July 2016 he visited Bradninch to inspect a new \\"affordable housing\\" development built there in partnership by the Duchy and the Guinness Trust.Sunday Express newspaper, 18 July 2016 Later history Bradninch lost its borough status in 1886 under the provisions of the Municipal Corporations Act. The town was largely destroyed in a fire in 1666 (the same year as the Great Fire of London). Notable buildings Notable buildings in the town include Bradninch Guildhall (on which the Bradninch Eagle is depicted), The Castle Pub, the manor house, Earlsland House, Comfort House, and the parish church.left St Disen's Church The 15th-century church is dedicated to St Disen, a unique dedication in the British Isles, who is considered to have been an Irish missionary saint. Previously this church was dedicated to St Denis or St Dionysius, and some confusion has arisen with some believing the attribution to St Disen to have been a romantic invention of one of the 19th-century vicars of the parish, Rev. Mr. Croslegh.N. Orme, English Church Dedications, p. 53 The church possesses a finely decorated screen; in the panels at the screen's base are nearly 50 paintings of saints and biblical scenes. Another screen in the church is simpler, with panels of various saints, including an unusual one of St Francis of Assisi receiving the stigmata.

Books about Bradninch  The best known book about the town is by Charles Croslegh. He became vicar of Bradninch in 1897 and wrote a 360-page history of the town entitled \\"Bradninch, being a short historical sketch of the honor, the manor, the borough, and liberties, and the parish\\". Other books have been written about the history of Bradninch and Hele by Anthony Taylor and by Paddy Nash.  Royal connections  The Bradninch 'eagle' seal ‚Äì an eagle displayed sable on a shield argent ‚Äì was given to the burgesses of the town in about 1120 by the illegitimate son of Henry 1, Arthur Reginald (Earl of Cornwall and Lord of Bradninch), when, by his letters patent, he incorporated the town and borough of Bradninch. In 1337 King Edward III bestowed the first English dukedom on his eldest son, also called Edward, (and later known as 'The Black Prince'), naming him the Duke of Cornwall and Baron of Bradninch. Since then, the Monarch's eldest son has been the Lord of the Manor of Bradninch. The Prince of Wales, Prince Charles, currently holds the title. Much of the farmland around the town still belongs to his Duchy of Cornwall estate. Notoriety Bradninch was one of the last towns in England to punish someone by placing them in stocks. On 2 November 1866 Cornelius Pippet, a cooper was convicted of drunkenness and placed in stocks for 6 hours.Croslegh, Charles ‚Äì Bradninch, being a short historical sketch of the honor, the manor, the borough, and liberties, and the parish.

P. Singh. History V. P. Singh united the entire disparate spectrum of parties ranging from regional parties such as the Telugu Desam Party, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, and the Asom Gana Parishad, together and formed the National Front with N. T. Rama Rao as President and V. P. Singh as convenor with outside support from the Bharatiya Janata Party and Communist Party of India (Marxist) led Left front. They defeated Rajiv Gandhi's Congress (I) in the 1989 parliamentary elections. His government fell after Lalu Prasad Yadav, got Advani arrested in Samastipur and stopped his Ram Rath Yatra which was going to Ayodhya on the site of the Babri Masjid on October 23, 1990 and the Bharatiya Janata Party withdrew support. V.P. Singh lost a parliamentary vote of confidence on November 7, 1990. In the 1991 Indian general election the Janata Dal lost power but emerged as the third largest party in Lok Sabha. Janata Dal-led United Front formed the government after the 1996 Indian general election with the outside support of the Indian National Congress. But after this the Janata Dal gradually disintegated into various smaller factions, largely regional parties Biju Janata Dal, Rashtriya Janata Dal, Janata Dal (Secular) and Janata Dal (United). Ascent to power V. P. Singh It first came to power in 1989, after allegations of corruption, known as the Bofors scandal, caused Rajiv Gandhi's Congress (I) to lose the elections. The National Front coalition that was formed consisted of the Janata Dal and a few smaller parties in the government, and had outside support from the Left Front and the Bharatiya Janata Party. V. P. Singh was the Prime Minister. In November 1990, this coalition collapsed, and a new government headed by Chandra Shekhar under Samajwadi Janata Party (Rashtriya) which had the support of the Congress came to power for a short while. Two days before the vote, Chandra Shekhar, an ambitious Janata Dal rival who had been kept out of the National Front government, joined with Devi Lal, a former deputy prime minister under V.P. Singh, to form the Samajwadi Janata Party, with a total of just sixty Lok Sabha members. The day after the collapse of the National Front government, Chandra Shekhar informed the president that by gaining the backing of the Congress (I) and its electoral allies he enjoyed the support of 280 members of the Lok Sabha, and he demanded the right to constitute a new government. Even though his rump party accounted for only one-ninth of the members of the Lok Sabha, Chandra Shekhar succeeded in forming a new minority Government and becoming Prime Minister (with Devi Lal as Deputy Prime Minister). However, Chandra Shekhar's government fell less than four months later, after the Congress (I) withdrew its support. I. K. Gujral Its second spell of power began in 1996, when the Janata Dal-led United Front coalition came to power, with outside support from the Congress under Sitaram Kesri, choosing H. D. Deve Gowda as their prime minister. The Congress withdrew their support in less than a year, hoping to gain power with the support of various United Front constituent groups, and I. K. Gujral became the next prime minister. His government too fell in a few months, and in February 1998, the Janata Dal-led coalition lost power to the Bharatiya Janata Party.

The Gregorian Reforms were a series of reforms initiated by Pope Gregory VII and the circle he formed in the papal curia, c. 1050‚Äì80, which dealt with the moral integrity and independence of the clergy. The reforms are considered to be named after Pope Gregory VII (1073‚Äì85), though he personally denied it and claimed his reforms, like his regnal name, honoured Pope Gregory I. Overview During Gregory's pontificate, a conciliar approach to implementing papal reform took on an added momentum. Conciliarism properly refers to a later system of power between the Pope, the Roman curia, and secular authorities. During this early period, the scope of Papal authority in the wake of the Investiture Controversy entered into dialog with developing notions of Papal Supremacy. The authority of the emphatically \\"Roman\\" council as the universal legislative assembly was theorised according to the principles of papal primacy contained in Dictatus papae. Gregory also had to avoid the Church slipping back into the abuses that had occurred in Rome, during The Rule of the Harlots, between 904 and 964. Pope Benedict IX had been elected Pope three times and had sold the Papacy. In 1054 the \\"Great Schism\\" had divided western European Christians from the eastern Orthodox Church. Given these events, the Church had to reassert its importance and authority to its followers. Within the Church important new laws were pronounced on simony, on clerical marriage and from 1059, laws extending the prohibited degrees of Affinity. Although at each new turn the reforms were presented to contemporaries as a return to the old ways, they are often seen by modern historians as the first European Revolution. The much later Gregorian calendar of Pope Gregory XIII has no connection to these Gregorian reforms. Documents The reforms are encoded in two major documents: Dictatus papae and the bull Libertas ecclesiae. The Gregorian reform depended in new ways and to a new degree on the collections of canon law that were being assembled, in order to buttress the papal position, during the same period. Part of the legacy of the Gregorian Reform was the new figure of the papal legist, exemplified a century later by Pope Innocent III. There is no explicit mention of Gregory‚Äôs reforms against simony (the selling of church offices and sacred things) or nicolaism (which included ritual fornication) at his Lenten Councils of 1075 or 1076. Rather, the gravity of these reforms has to be inferred from his general correspondence. By contrast, Gregory's Register entry for the Roman Council of November 1078 extensively records Gregory‚Äôs legislation against ‚Äòabuses‚Äô such as simony as well as the first ‚Äòfull‚Äô prohibition of lay investiture. This record has been interpreted as the essence of the Gregorian ‚Äòreform programme‚Äô. The powers that the Gregorian papacy gathered to itself are summed up in a list called Dictatus papae around 1075 or shortly after. The major headings of Gregorian reform can be seen as embodied in the Papal electoral decree (1059), and the temporary resolution of the Investiture Controversy (1075‚Äì1122) was an overwhelming papal victory. The resolution of this controversy acknowledged papal superiority over secular rulers by implication. Central status of the Church Before the Gregorian Reforms the Church was a heavily decentralized institution, in which the pope held little power outside of his position as Bishop of Rome. With that in mind, the papacy up until the twelfth century held little to no authority over the bishops, who were invested with land by lay rulers. Gregory VII's ban on lay investiture was a key element of the reform, ultimately contributing to the centralized papacy of the later Middle Ages. The reform of the Church, both within it, and in relation to the Holy Roman Emperor and the other lay rulers of Europe, was Gregory VII's life work. It was based on his conviction that the Church was founded by God and entrusted with the task of embracing all mankind in a single society in which divine will is the only law; that, in his capacity as a divine institution, he is supreme over all human structures, especially the secular state; and that the pope, in his role as head of the Church under the petrine commission, is the vice-regent of God on earth, so that disobedience to him implies disobedience to God: or, in other words, a defection from Christianity. But any attempt to interpret this in terms of action would have bound the Church to annihilate not merely a single state, but all states. Thus Gregory, as a politician wanting to achieve some result, was driven in practice to adopt a different standpoint. He acknowledged the existence of the state as a dispensation of Providence, described the coexistence of church and state as a divine ordinance, and emphasized the necessity of union between the sacerdotium and the imperium. But, during no period would he have imagined the two powers on an equal footing. The superiority of Church to State was to him a fact which admitted no discussion and which he had never doubted. He wished to see all important matters of dispute referred to Rome; appeals were to be addressed to himself; the centralization of ecclesiastical government in Rome naturally involved a curtailment of the powers of bishops. Since these refused to submit voluntarily and tried to assert their traditional independence, his papacy was full of struggles against the higher ranks of the clergy. Clerical celibacy This battle for the foundation of papal supremacy is connected with his championship of compulsory celibacy among the clergy and his attack on simony. Gregory VII did not introduce the celibacy of the priesthood into the Church , but he took up the struggle with greater energy than his predecessors. In 1074 he published an encyclical, absolving the people from their obedience to bishops who allowed married priests. The next year he enjoined them to take action against married priests and deprived these clerics of their revenues. Both the campaign against priestly marriage and that against simony provoked widespread resistance.

The town grew as a centre for coal mining, brewing and hosiery manufacturing. Together with the neighbouring villages of Giltbrook, Greasley and Swingate it has a population of around 6,500 people. At the 2011 Census the appropriate ward was Cossall and Kimberley. This had a population of 6,659. There has been no mining or hosiery manufacturing in the town for many years and the local brewery was sold and closed at the end of 2006. However as of 2017 it has a retail park centre, which includes a local newsagent, a wine shop, a pharmacy, as well as big national chains like Greggs bakery and a Sainsbury's superstore. History Kimberley is referred to as Chinemarelie in William the Conqueror's Domesday Book. With the accession of William to the throne Kimberley came into the possession of William de Peveril.Domesday Book: A Complete Transliteration. London: Penguin, 2003. p.772 The Peverils lost control when they supported the losing side in the civil war which preceded the accession of Henry II of England in 1154. The King became the owner of the land. King John of England granted land in the area to Ralph de Greasley in 1212 who took up residence at Greasley Castle and also at around this time to Henry de Grey whose son re- built Codnor Castle on the site of an earlier castle established by William Peveril. Ralph de Greasley's land passed by inheritance and marriage to Nicholas de Cantelupe who took part in Edward III of England's Scottish campaigns and also the Battle of Cr√©cy. Nicholas founded Beauvale Priory using part of his Kimberley holding in 1343. That part of Kimberley which had become the property of Beauvale Priory was claimed by King Henry VIII during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century. The Priory's land was redistributed by the King and came into the possession of Arthur Capell, 1st Baron Capell of Hadham again by inheritance and marriage in 1627. Arthur was beheaded in 1649 having fought for the Royalists in the English Civil War. Arthur's son was created Earl of Essex in 1661. In 1753 the land was purchased by Sir Matthew Lamb whose grandson William Lamb became Prime Minister in 1834. The Lamb's Kimberley estates passed by marriage to the 5th Earl Cowper in 1805 and on the death of the 7th Earl in 1913 were sold off in pieces. That part of Kimberley retained by the Cantelupe's passed by inheritance and marriage to John Lord Zouch who died at the Battle of Bosworth with Richard III in 1485. He was posthumously found guilty of high treason with his property forfeited to Henry VII. John Savage (-1491) received this part of Kimberley in gratitude for his efforts on behalf of Henry VII at Bosworth. The Savage family sold this land to the Earl of Rutland in the early 17th century. The Duke of Rutland's Kimberley estates were sold in parcels in the early 19th century. Industry Kimberley has been home to a lot of industry including: coal mining, brewing and hosiery manufacturing. All major industry in kimberley has stopped, the last being Kimberley Brewery which ceased brewing in Dec 2006. Most businesses are now retail based concerns. Kimberley today One of Kimberley's most notable structures is its unusual war memorial, in the form of a rotunda which is used as the emblem of Kimberley School. This secondary school has a catchment area which extends into the neighbouring areas of Nuthall, Eastwood, Watnall, and Hempshill Vale. Kimberley Chapel of Rest on Knowle Hill On the South side of Kimberley lies Swingate, which has many different walking and cycling routes into the woods and surrounding countryside. The twin towns of Kimberley are √âchirolles in France and Grugliasco in Italy. Kimberley Brewery was taken over by Greene King in 2006, another major brewer in a multimillion-pound deal which marked the end of the traditional Kimberley Ales as ale brewing ceased shortly afterwards and only a distribution centre remained there. The former Kimberley Brewery site has within its boundaries a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). It is listed under the title of \\"Kimberley Railway Cutting\\" as an important location for Permian Gymnosperm fossils. The Permian - Carboniferous unconformity can be found in the Kimberley Railway Cutting. Since 1974, Kimberley forms part of the borough of Broxtowe. From 1894 to 1974 it was part of Basford Rural District Council area. There has been speculation that the Nottingham Express Transit (NET) want to extend their tram line that currently terminates at Phoenix Park stop through Kimberley towards Giltbrook Retail Park.

Scholars attribute to his name a Greek etymology possibly meant as ‚Äúflowing with water‚Äù, although with a Hellenist-styled ending. At some point between 44 and 46 AD, Theudas led his followers in a short-lived revolt. The revolt Our principal source for the story is Josephus, who wrote: > It came to pass, while Cuspius Fadus was procurator of Judea, that a certain > charlatan, whose name was Theudas, persuaded a great part of the people to > take their effects with them, and follow him to the Jordan river; for he > told them he was a prophet, and that he would, by his own command, divide > the river, and afford them an easy passage over it. Many were deluded by his > words. However, Fadus did not permit them to make any advantage of his wild > attempt, but sent a troop of horsemen out against them. After falling upon > them unexpectedly, they slew many of them, and took many of them alive. They > also took Theudas alive, cut off his head, and carried it to Jerusalem. > (Jewish Antiquities 20.97-98) The movement was dispersed, and was never heard of again. Josephus does not provide a number for Theudas's followers, but Acts 5:36, if it is referring to the same Theudas (see below), reports that they numbered about 400. The Theudas problem The sole reference to Theudas presents a problem of chronology if one assumes the Acts of the Apostles and Josephus are speaking of the same person and Josephus is correct. In Acts, Gamaliel, a member of the Sanhedrin, defends the apostles by referring to Theudas: The difficulty is that Gamaliel, speaking before the year 37, is described as referring to the rising of Theudas, linking it to the revolt of Judas of Galilee at the time of the Census of Quirinius decades before, in 6 CE. However, Josephus makes clear that the revolt of Theudas took place around 45, which is after Gamaliel is said to have spoken, and long after the time of Judas the Galilean.Louis H. Feldman, Jewish Life and Thought among Greeks and Romans: Primary Readings (A&C; Black, 1996) page 335.Talbert, Charles H. Reading Luke-Acts in Its Mediterranean Milieu Brill pg 200Mohd Elfie Nieshaem Juferi, It has been proposed that the writer of Acts used Josephus as a source, and made a mistake in reading the text, taking a later reference to the execution of the \\"sons of Judas the Galilean\\" after the rebellion of Theudas as saying that the rebellion of Judas was later; however it is a minority view as to whether the author of Luke used Josephus. It has also been suggested that the reference in Acts is to a different revolt by another, unknown Theudas,Colin J. Hemer, Conrad H. Gempf, The book of Acts in the setting of Hellenistic history (Mohr Siebeck, 1989), pages 162-3.Ronald F. Youngblood, Nelson's Illustrated Bible Dictionary (Thomas F. Nelson, 2014) page 1128. because Josephus states that there were numerous uprisings, saying there were \\"ten thousand disorders\\", but he gives details on only four and Theudas was not a unique name.

History Herring's keel was laid down 14 July 1941 by the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 15 January 1942 (sponsored by Mrs. Emilie Spear (n√©e Piollet), wife of Rear Admiral Ray Spear, Chief of the Bureau of Supplies and Accounts), and commissioned on 4 May 1942 with Lieutenant Commander Raymond W. Johnson (Class of 1930) in command. Mediterranean After shakedown, the new submarine was one of five sent to the Mediterranean Sea to take station off the North African coast prior to Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa. Reaching her position off Casablanca on 5 November 1942, Herring remained there, spotting but not attacking several targets. On the morning of 8 November as the invasion was launched, the patient sub had her chance, sinking the 5,700 ton cargo ship Ville du Havre. Herring returned to Rosneath, Scotland, on 25 November and departed for her second war patrol 16 December, but targets were scarce. The fourth war patrol, an antisubmarine sweep in Icelandic waters, and fifth patrol, which took her back to the United States on 26 July 1943, netted Herring no more kills. Pacific Herring departed New London, Connecticut, for the rich hunting grounds of the Pacific on 9 August 1943. After intensive training at Pearl Harbor, she sailed 15 November 1943 on her sixth war patrol to join the ranks of the American submarines systematically decimating Japanese shipping and destroying the Japanese economy. She scored two kills, the 3,948 ton Hakozaki Maru on 14 December, and the 6,072 ton Nagoya Maru to celebrate New Year's Day 1944. Herring‚Äôs next patrol was a frustrating one as on 24 March 1944 she stalked a large aircraft carrier but was detected and driven deep before she could attack. Lieutenant Commander Johnson commanded Herring for five of her first six patrols, with the sole exception being March 1943 when John Corbus was in command. On her seventh and eight patrols she was captained by Lieutenant Commander David Zabriskie, Jr. Loss Herring‚Äôs eighth war patrol was to be both her most successful and her last. Topping off at Midway Island on 21 May 1944, Herring headed for the Kurile Islands patrol area. Ten days later she rendezvoused with . Herring was never heard from or seen again. However, Japanese records prove that she sank two ships, and Hokuyo Maru, on the night of 30 ‚Äì 31 May. Ishigaki had been responsible for the sinking of on 7 October 1943. Herring's exact manner of loss can also be determined from these records. Two more merchant ships, Hiburi Maru and Iwaki Maru, were sunk while at anchor in Matsuwa Island on the morning of 1 June 1944. In a counter-attack, enemy shore batteries scored two direct hits on the submarine's conning tower and \\"bubbles covered an area about 5 meters wide, and heavy oil covered an area of approximately 15 miles.\\" On her last patrol, Herring had sunk four Japanese ships for a total of 13,202 tons. In all she had sunk six marus totaling 19,959 tons, and a Vichy cargo ship.

The publicity surrounding the event led to the story being dramatized in the book and film, Barbarians at the Gate. Kravis was portrayed in the film by actor Jonathan Pryce. In early 1995, KKR divested its remaining holdings in RJR Nabisco, taking an overall loss on the deal. A journalist for the New York Times wrote a few years later that \\"the deal will go down in history as showing just how difficult it can be to get out of a huge deal that goes badly, and of the perils of putting too much money on one investment.\\" KKR pledged not to commit so much of its fund to a single investment again in the future.

MacDraw was one of the first WYSIWYG drawing programs that could be used in collaboration with MacWrite. MacDraw was useful for drawing technical diagrams and floorplans. It was eventually adapted by Claris and, in the early 1990s, MacDraw Pro was released with color support. MacDraw was the vector cousin of MacPaint. In the preface of the third edition of Introduction to Algorithms, the authors make an emphatic plea for the creation of an OS X-compatible version of MacDraw Pro.  Early versions  MacDraw was based on Apple's earlier program, LisaDraw, which was developed for the Apple Lisa computer which was released in 1983. LisaDraw and MacDraw were developed by the same person, Mark Cutter. The first version of MacDraw was similar to that of MacPaint, featuring both the same tools and patterns. However MacDraw was vector-based, meaning that an object's properties and placement can be changed at any time. MacDraw included features for printing and also integrated into MacWrite via cut-and-paste. MacDraw was more advanced than MacPaint, featuring a grid and the ability to change the drawing dimensions. However MacDraw lacked support for using more than one document at a time, and also lacked zooming capabilities. MacDraw was especially useful in drawing flowcharts, diagrams and technical drawings.  Later incarnations  MacDraw II (1988) was a complete rewrite of the original MacDraw. It was developed at Apple by project leader Gerard Schuten and team members Amy Goldsmith and Marjory Kaptanoglu, and was released by Claris. MacDraw II introduced color and many other missing features and was also enhanced for the Macintosh II. MacDraw eventually evolved into MacDraw Pro (1991) and ultimately ClarisDraw (1993). The final version of ClarisDraw was 1.0v4 (1994). It ran without difficulties on PPC-based Macs under the Classic OS until the arrival of the Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) operating system, which dropped support for the Classic OS. Dekorra Optics have a version of their EazyDraw software, EazyDraw Retro, that can open documents produced by the various incarnations of MacDraw, including ClarisDraw.

Under the U.S. Constitution's Appointments Clause, the President is empowered to nominate, as well as with the advice and consent (confirmation) of the United States Senate, make appointments to high-level policy-making positions in federal departments, agencies, boards and commissions. A recess appointment under Article II, Section 2, Clause 3 of the Constitution is an alternative method of appointing officials that allows the filling of vacancies to maintain the continuity of administrative government through the temporary filling of offices during periods when the Senate is not in session. On occasion and controversially, this power has also been used to temporarily install an unpopular nominee by sidestepping the Senate's role in the confirmation process; the Senate has taken measures from time to time to prevent a President making recess appointments. In April 2020, President Donald Trump claimed that the President's constitutional power to, \\"on extraordinary occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them\\", a power that has been used only once before, empowers him to convene both houses of Congress and enables him to make appointments while Congress is in recess. Appointments made in recess must be confirmed by the Senate by the end of the next session of Congress, or the appointment expires. In current practice this means that a recess appointment must be approved by roughly the end of the next calendar year, and thus could last for almost two years. Constitutional text Article II, Section 2, Clause 3, commonly known as the Recess Appointment Clause, provides that, History Presidents since George Washington have made recess appointments. Washington appointed South Carolina judge John Rutledge as Chief Justice of the United States during a congressional recess in 1795. Because of Rutledge's political views and occasional mental illness, however, the Senate rejected his nomination, and Rutledge attempted suicide and resigned. Almost every president has used recess appointments to appoint judges, over 300 such judicial recess appointments before 2000, including ten Supreme Court justices. New Jersey judge William J. Brennan was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956 by a recess appointment. This was done in part with an eye on the presidential campaign that year; Eisenhower was running for reelection, and his advisors thought it would be politically advantageous to place a northeastern Catholic on the court. Brennan was promptly confirmed when the Senate came back into session. Eisenhower, in a recess appointment, designated Charles W. Yost as United States Ambassador to Syria. Eisenhower made two other recess appointments, Chief Justice Earl Warren and Associate Justice Potter Stewart. According to the Congressional Research Service, President Ronald Reagan made 240 recess appointments (average 30 per year) and President George H. W. Bush made 77 recess appointments (average 19 per year). George H. W. Bush appointed Lawrence Eagleburger as Secretary of State during a recess in 1992; Eagleburger, as Deputy Secretary of State, had in effect filled that role after James Baker resigned. President Bill Clinton made 139 recess appointments (average of 17 per year). President George W. Bush made 171 recess appointments (average of 21 per year). During the last two years of the Bush administration, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid sought to prevent further recess appointments. Bush promised not to make any during the August recess that year, but no agreement was reached for the two-week Thanksgiving break, in November 2007. As a result, Reid did not allow adjournments of more than three days from then until the end of the Bush presidency by holding pro forma sessions. Prior to this, there had been speculation that James W. Holsinger would receive a recess appointment as Surgeon General of the United States. President Barack Obama made 32 recess appointments (through February 1, 2015), all to full-time positions. Over what would have traditionally been the 2011‚Äì12 winter recess of the 112th Congress, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives did not assent to recess, specifically to block Richard Cordray's appointment as Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Both the House and Senate continued to hold pro forma sessions. In August 2017, nine pro forma sessions were set up to block President Donald Trump from making recess appointments. The concern was that Trump might dismiss Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and try to name his successor while Congress was in recess.Senate blocks Trump from making recess appointments over break Pro forma sessions continued to be held until January 2019. They were held on December 31, 2018, and again on January 2, 2019, the last full day of the 115th United States Congress, that lasted several minutes. On April 15, 2020, while Congress was holding pro forma sessions due to the recess during the COVID-19 pandemic, President Trump threatened to prorogue both houses of Congress in order to make recess appointments for vacant positions such as the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the Director of National Intelligence. However, the U.S. Constitution only grants the President the authority to prorogue Congress if it is unable to agree on a date of adjournment, and both Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have indicated that they will not alter the planned date of January 3, 2021. Congressional action to prevent recess appointments The Senate or House may seek to block potential recess appointments by not allowing the Senate to adjourn under Article 1, Section 5, Clause 4 of the Constitution, which provides that both Houses must consent to an adjournment.Article 1, Section 5, Clause 4: Adjournment of the Constitution says: \\"Neither House ... shall, without the Consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days\\". This tactic is especially used when either House of Congress is controlled by a different party than that of the President, the Senate or House may seek to block potential recess appointments by not allowing the Senate to adjourn for more than three days, blocking a longer adjournment that would allow recess appointments to be made. In order to combat this tactic from Congress the President can dismiss Congress under Article II section 3 of the constitution that states According to Article II Section 2 of the constitution the President can appoint or fill up the vacancies that happen during a recess without the Senate's approval, but those positions will end at the end of the next legislative session unless Congress approves the appointment.https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii Legality of intra-session appointments According to Henry B. Hogue, of the Congressional Research Service's Government and Finance Division: It has been argued that as the clause was originally understood, it was expected that if the Senate was in session when an office became vacant, the president would make a standard advice-and-consent appointment at that time.PDF, \\"The Original Meaning of the Recess Appointments Clause\\", UCLA Law Review, Volume 52, Number 5 (June 2005), pp. 1487‚Äì1578. In Federalist No. 67, Alexander Hamilton wrote: Another argument maintains that recess appointments were to be made only during inter-session recesses, which during the early days of the country lasted between six and nine months, and were therefore required to prevent important offices from remaining unfilled for long periods. The view holds that the current interpretation allows appointments to be made during recesses too brief to justify bypassing the Senate. Historically, presidents tended to make recess appointments when the Senate was adjourned for lengthy periods. Since World War II, presidents have sometimes made recess appointments when Senate opposition appeared strong in the hope that appointees might prove themselves in office and then allow opposition to dissipate. Most recently, however, as partisanship on Capitol Hill has grown, recess appointments have tended to solidify opposition to the appointee. Obama's challenge  Regardless of continuing to hold pro forma sessions, on January 4, 2012, President Obama appointed Cordray and others as recess appointments. White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler asserted that the appointments were valid, because the pro forma sessions were designed to, \\"through form, render a constitutional power of the executive obsolete\\" and that the Senate was for all intents and purposes recessed. Republicans in the Senate disputed the appointments, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stating that Obama had \\"arrogantly circumvented the American people\\" with the appointments. It was expected that there would be a legal challenge to the appointments. On January 6, 2012, the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion regarding recess appointments and pro forma sessions, claiming, > \\"The convening of periodic pro forma sessions in which no business is to be > conducted does not have the legal effect of interrupting an intrasession > recess otherwise long enough to qualify as a \\"Recess of the Senate\\" under > the Recess Appointments Clause. In this context, the President therefore has > discretion to conclude that the Senate is unavailable to perform its advise- > and-consent function and to exercise his power to make recess appointments\\". Judicial challenges However, this was widely disputed. The first such challenge was announced in April 2012, disputing a National Labor Relations Board ruling made following the Obama appointments. On January 25, 2013, in the first circuit case to rule on the validity of the January 4, 2012, appointments, Chief Judge David Sentelle, writing for a unanimous three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, wrote > \\"an interpretation of 'the Recess' that permits the President to decide when > the Senate is in recess would demolish the checks and balances inherent in > the advice-and-consent requirement, giving the President free rein to > appoint his desired nominees at any time he pleases, whether that time be a > weekend, lunch, or even when the Senate is in session and he is merely > displeased with its inaction. This cannot be the law.\\" On June 26, 2014, in a 9‚Äì0 ruling, the United States Supreme Court validated this practice of using pro forma sessions to block the president from using the recess appointment authority. Justice Breyer also wrote in NLRB v. Noel Canning that the President could force a recess if he had enough congressional support: > \\"The Constitution also gives the President (if he has enough allies in > Congress) a way to force a recess. Art. II, ¬ß3 ('[I]n Case of Disagreement > between [the Houses], with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, [the > President] may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper'). > Moreover, the President and Senators engage with each other in many > different ways [*28] and have a variety of methods of encouraging each other > to accept their points of view. Regardless, the Recess Appointments Clause > is not designed to overcome serious institutional friction. It simply > provides a subsidiary method for appointing officials when the Senate is > away during a recess.\\" (On July 16, 2013, the U.S. Senate confirmed Cordray to a five-year term as Director.) Prior to National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning, there was a split among the circuit courts on the validity of intra-session appointments and on what vacancies can be filled using the Recess Appointment authority. Following the 2003 intra-session appointment of William H. Pryor, Jr., to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, a small number of criminal defendants, whose appeals were denied by panels including Pryor, appealed on the basis that Pryor's appointment was invalid. The Eleventh Circuit, in an en banc decision in Evans v. StephensEvans v. Stephens, 387 F.3d 1220 (11th Cir. 2004). held that the Constitution permitted both intra-session recess appointments and recess appointments to fill vacancies that \\"happened\\" prior to rather than during the congressional recess. However, NLRB v. Noel Canning, Circuit docket 12-1115 in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, appealed a decision made by National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) members appointed, in what President Obama determined was an intra-session recess was decided in a three-member panel decision on January 25, 2013, that intra-session appointments were unconstitutional because the word \\"the\\" before the word \\"Recess\\" in the Constitution was determined to mean to limit it to only the inter-session recess, and it further limited the power by limiting it to only those vacancies that \\"happen\\" to occur during the inter-session break, not to vacancies that existed prior to the recess. Also, on March 16, 2013, the Third Circuit joined the D.C. Circuit and held that the March 2010 appointment of Craig Becker to the NLRB was invalid because he was not appointed between sessions. On June 26, 2014, the United States Supreme Court rejected both holdings, while also unanimously deciding that President Obama overreached his executive authority in appointing members to the NLRB while the Senate was still formally in session.\\"Senate 9, President 0.\\" The Wall Street Journal. Dow Jones & Company, June 26, 2014. Web. June 28, 2014. Justice Stephen Breyer, in the majority opinion, wrote that the Constitution allows for the Congress itself to determine its sessions and recesses, that \\"the Senate is in session when it says it is\\", and that the President does not have the unilateral right to dictate Congressional sessions and thus make recess appointments. However, the decision allows the use of recess appointments during breaks within a session for vacancies that existed prior to the break.

The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 11 February 1982 and her keel was laid on 24 September 1984. She was launched on 14 December 1985‚Äîsponsored by Mrs. Betty Ann McKee (n√©e Harris), wife of Admiral Kinnaird McKee, Director of Naval Nuclear Propulsion ‚Äîand commissioned on 8 November 1986 with Captain Charles E.

During her stay at San Diego, Louisville conducted several WestPac deployments. During her 1988‚Äì1989 Westpac deployment, Louisville visited Korea, Japan, Thailand, the Philippines, and Guam. In January and February 1991, as Operation Desert Storm began, Louisville carried out the first war patrol conducted by an American submarine since World War II. The patrol began with a 14,000-mile submerged, high-speed transit across the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean to the Red Sea. Shortly after noon on 19 January, she launched Tomahawk cruise missiles against targets in Iraq, becoming the first submarine to launch Tomahawks in combat.\\"Gulf War: January 1991.\\" US Navy. For this war patrol, Louisville was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation. In 2003, Louisville participated in Operation Iraqi Freedom, launching 16 Tomahawk missiles from the Red Sea against targets in Iraq. Her deployment was extended to eight and a half months in support of the campaign. She was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for her role in the operation. Louisville completed an extensive overhaul in Portsmouth, NH, at the end of 2008. She returned to her homeport of Pearl Harbor in the spring of 2009 as a part of CSS-3.

While it was a relatively minor party, it took part in the first democratically elected government in East Germany in 1990, and is especially known because future Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel started her political career within the party. It was founded on 29 October 1989, based on existing politically active church groups. Founding members included Wolfgang Schnur, Friedrich Schorlemmer, Rainer Eppelmann, G√ºnter Nooke and Thomas Welz. The organisation became a political party on December 16/17, 1989 in Leipzig. The party convention adopted a more conservative program than some of the founding members, like Schorlemmer, were willing to bear, so they left the party. Others, like Nooke, who left some time later, resented the growing cooperation with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of East Germany, which had been a member of the Communist-dominated National Front of parties and mass organisations that had supported the Communist regime. Democratic Awakening now supported rapid German reunification and joined the Alliance for Germany (Allianz f√ºr Deutschland) along with the CDU and German Social Union (DSU) for the 1990 Volkskammer elections on March 18. Only a few days prior to the elections, party chairman Schnur had to confess to having been an informer for the Ministry for State Security (Stasi), and resigned. Although Alliance for Germany won the elections, Democratic Awakening only collected 0.9% of votes, amounting to four seats in the Volkskammer. Eppelmann became minister for disarmament and defense in the new government and new party chairman. On 4 August 1990, Democratic Awakening ceased to exist after merging into the East German CDU, which in turn on 3 October 1990 merged into its West German counterpart, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). From February 1990, Angela Merkel served as the party's spokeswoman. After the mergers, Merkel was elected in the post-unification election as a member of the all-German Bundestag for the CDU, was immediately appointed a minister in Helmut Kohl's government as a form of East German representation, became party chairwoman in 2000 and eventually Chancellor of Germany in 2005.

Hanukkah Harry is portrayed on the show as a variation upon the modern-day image of Santa Claus, with a beard characteristic of a male adherent of Haredi Judaism, and with his hat in blue with white edges (the colors of an Ashkenazi Jewish tallit, or prayer shawl, shared by the flag of Israel). Saturday Night Live Jon Lovitz (2008) Hanukkah Harry's first appearance on SNL was on Season 15: Episode 9, a show first broadcast on December 16, 1989, with guest host Andie MacDowell, in a sketch titled \\"The Night Hanukkah Harry Saved Christmas\\", that viewers are told is sponsored by Hallmark Cards in association with the Jewish Anti-Defamation League. Unable to deliver toys to children due to a stomach virus, Santa calls Hanukkah Harry (Jon Lovitz) at his workshop on Mount Sinai, asking if he could fill in. Hanukkah Harry agrees and flies through the air on a cart pulled by three donkeys, Moische, Herschel and Schlomo. Hanukkah Harry lands on a roof and climbs down the chimney of the home of Scott (Mike Myers) and Christine (Victoria Jackson), offering gifts of slacks and socks respectively, as well as chocolate coins and a dreidel. While the children are initially disappointed at their gifts, their realization that Hanukkah Harry had helped Santa, makes them recognize that \\"Christians and Jews, deep down, are pretty much the same. Maybe that's the true meaning of Christmas!\\" With that statement Santa's flu is cured, and Santa comes down the chimney bearing gifts of Barbie make-me-pretty for Christine and a pellet gun for Scott. Hanukkah Harry's second appearance on SNL was on Season 15: Episode 17, with guest host Corbin Bernsen, first broadcast on April 14, 1990, in a sketch titled \\"The Night Hanukkah Harry Saved Easter.\\" The definitive scholarly and popular treatment of Hannukah Harry appears in the book A Kosher Christmas: 'Tis the Season to Be Jewish by Rabbi Joshua Eli Plaut, Ph.D. in the fourth chapter entitled ‚Äú \`Twas the Night Before Hanukkah: Remaking Christmas Through Parody and Popular Culture.‚Äù Plaut details and analyzes how Hannukah Harry becomes an American folk hero as a counterpart to Santa Claus.Plaut, Joshua, A Kosher Christmas: 'Tis the Season to Be Jewish, pages 104-108. Other appearances Building on these two SNL appearances, Hanukkah Harry has been referenced as a personification of Hanukkah to correspond to Santa Claus in various other media, including on National Public Radio, and on the pages of The New York Times in which Jonathan Safran Foer satirically described him as \\"a real person who drops in on Jewish homes each of the eights nights of Hanukkah to deliver gifts that are in no way dependent on children's good behavior\\". The Baltimore Sun has called Hanukkah Harry one of the best Saturday Night Live sketches of all time.

He was elected as a Conservative in the 2001 general election, until resigning the party's parliamentary whip in May 2013 following questions surrounding paid advocacy, and was an Independent MP representing the constituency of Newark in Parliament until his resignation at the end of April 2014 after the Standards Committee suspended him for six months for \\"sustained and pervasive breach of the house's rules\\". He is a frequent commentator on defence and security issues, having served as an infantry officer in the British Army and held the position of Shadow Minister for Homeland Security. He is a former journalist for the BBC and has to date written four military novels. He is a patron of the Victoria Cross Trust. Early life and education Born in Stockport in Cheshire in 1956, Mercer is the son of Eric Mercer, who became Bishop of Exeter. His mother was born in Lincolnshire and his father was trained for the priesthood at Kelham Theological College near Newark. Mercer was educated at The King's School, Chester, and Exeter College, Oxford, where he read History. He was later commissioned after training at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. Whilst there, he was one of a number of cadets interviewed for an edition of the BBC's Panorama programme.Panorama: Sandhurst, BBC, transmitted 15 September 1975 Early career=British Army Mercer followed his father, who saw wartime service in the Sherwood Foresters (Notts & Derby Regiment), into the British Army. He was commissioned into the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment on 8 March 1975 as a second lieutenant. On 8 March 1977, he was promoted to lieutenant. He was promoted to captain on 8 September 1981, and to major on 30 September 1988. On 30 June 1994, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel, then to colonel on 30 June 1998. He retired from the military on 1 September 1999. During his time in the Army, Mercer completed nine tours in Northern Ireland and latterly commanded his battalion in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada and Tidworth. Mercer served at both the Staff College, Camberley and the Army's University at Cranfield. Mercer was Mentioned in Despatches in 1983 for \\"gallant and distinguished service in Northern Ireland during the period 1 November 1982 to 31 January 1983\\". He earned a gallantry commendation in 1990. He was made an MBE on 12 October 1993 \\"in recognition of distinguished service in Northern Ireland\\". He was made an OBE on 13 May 1997 \\"in recognition of gallant and distinguished services in the former Yugoslavia during the period 21 June to 20 December 1996\\". He left the Army in 1999 as a colonel, having been head of communications and strategy at the Army Training and Recruiting Agency. Political career=Parliament from 2001 Mercer was first elected to Parliament as the member for Newark at the 2001 general election, defeating the Labour incumbent, Fiona Jones, overturning a majority of 3,000 and creating a majority of just over 4,000. In the Commons, he initially served as a back-bencher on the Defence Select Committee before becoming Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Shadow Secretary of State for Defence. Mercer backed Iain Duncan Smith over Kenneth Clarke in the 2001 Conservative leadership election. Subsequently he was appointed to a newly created post of Shadow Minister for Homeland Security in June 2003 after Duncan Smith became Conservative leader, In 2004 he introduced a Private Member's Bill in response to the publicity surrounding the case of Tony Martin that proposed to give householders greater powers when protecting their property from burglary. Mercer increased his majority in Newark to 6,464 at the 2005 general election. Parliament from 2005 During the subsequent Conservative leadership contest, he publicly backed David Davis over David Cameron, Kenneth Clarke and Liam Fox. Since 2005, he has repeatedly warned against the imposition of control orders as being 'counter productive'. Citing his experience of internment in Northern Ireland, as a serving soldier, he highlighted the danger of alienating populations needed for intelligence gathering. Mercer was forced to resign as Shadow Minister for Homeland Security in March 2007 by David Cameron after talking about \\"idle and useless\\" ethnic minority soldiers who used racism as a \\"cover\\", although initially the Conservative Party stated the comments were a \\"private matter\\". Mercer apologised and said, \\"I had the privilege to command soldiers from across the east Midlands of whom many came from racial minorities. It was a matter of great pride to me that racial minorities prospered inside the unit. What I have said is clearly misjudged and I can only apologise if I have embarrassed in any way those fine men whom I commanded. I have no hesitation in resigning my front-bench appointment.\\" In December 2008 he was appointed as Chairman of the House of Commons Sub-Committee on Counter-Terrorism, to further his work as a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee. In March 2009 Mercer volunteered for three days at the charity, Save the Family, learning and helping displaced families as part of a programme devised by Iain Duncan Smith. Parliament from 2010 At the 2010 general election, Mercer more than doubled his majority to 16,152 to make Newark one of the safest Conservative seats in the country. In August 2010, Mercer warned that dissident Irish terror groups may be planning to attack the party conferences including the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham based on intelligence from serving army officers. In May 2011, he was appointed with Lord Ashcroft to review the future of the military bases in Cyprus. In August 2011, Mercer with his knowledge of Northern Ireland, led the calls for considering the use of water cannon and other robust police tactics to deal with the rioters during the 2011 England riots. The next day David Cameron approved the use of water cannon after chairing a session of the Cabinet Office Briefing Room, Cobra. In October 2011, Mercer supported a failed bid by the Everyday Champions Church to open a free school in his constituency. The bid was rejected because of concerns over the church's explicitly creationist stance. In November 2011, the press reported that Mercer had been taped making disparaging remarks about David Cameron, calling him \\"despicable\\" and describing him as an \\"arse\\" and \\"the worst politician in British history since William Gladstone\\". The same articles claimed he had predicted that Cameron would be ousted by Conservative MPs in early 2012. Mercer later denied making the comments. Controversy and resignation In 2007 he was forced to quit his position as shadow homeland security spokesperson following an interview with The Times where he claimed that racist abuse was an acceptable part of a soldier's life, and had admitted that many black soldiers in his regiment had been referred to as \\"nigger\\". Mercer resigned the Conservative Party whip on 31 May 2013 after an investigation by the Daily Telegraph and BBC's Panorama caught him on camera accepting payment for lobbying. On 29 April 2014, Mercer announced he would resign his seat following his suspension from the Commons for six months. He was appointed to the Chiltern Hundreds the next day, making the resignation effective. A by-election for the vacant Newark seat was held on 5 June 2014. The subsequent Standards Committee report on Mercer stated that MPs were \\"not aware of a case relating to a sitting MP which has involved such a sustained and pervasive breach of the house's rules on registration, declaration and paid advocacy.\\" It stated that Mercer \\"had deliberately evaded the rules\\", including engaging in \\"paid advocacy\\" and failing to make \\"any serious attempt to identify his ultimate clients\\". He had also failed to register monies received properly; to deposit the contract he signed to provide services; and to declare a relevant interest when tabling parliamentary questions, tabling an early-day motion, when making approaches to other MPs, and at a meeting of a prospective All-Party Parliamentary Group. Mercer was also criticised for \\"repeatedly denigrating fellow Members both individually and collectively\\". The recommended period of suspension from the House of Commons is the second longest suspension since 1947. (Denis MacShane, later convicted of a criminal offence, was suspended for twelve months in 2012, and also resigned immediately as an MP.) One member voted to expel Mercer as an MP, and another wanted him suspended for eight months. In 2013, talking to an undercover reporter, Mercer also described a meeting with a young Israeli who said she was a soldier. Mercer told the reporter he thought \\"You don't look like a soldier to me. You look like a bloody Jew\\".

In November 2012, jurors at Southwark Crown Court ruled that she had falsified her parliamentary expenses; she had been unable to stand trial because of mental health issues, but the case was nevertheless heard without her.Margaret Moran took ¬£53K in false MP expenses BBC News, 13 November 2012. Retrieved 10 February 2013. Her fraudulent claims totalled more than ¬£53,000, the highest amount by any politician in the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal.  Early life  Moran was born in Bethnal Green, to Irish parents Patrick and Mary (n√©e Murphy). She went to St Ursula's High School (now St Ursula's Convent School), a Roman Catholic girls' school in Greenwich, and then to St Mary's College (now St Mary's University College), a Roman Catholic college in Strawberry Hill, Twickenham. She subsequently attended the University of Birmingham, gaining a Bachelor of Social Science degree in geography and sociology in 1978. She also attended Hackney College. Before Parliament Moran, a feminist, initially worked as a teacher. In 1984, she became a local councillor in the London Borough of Lewisham; later she became leader of the council between 1993 and 1995. At the same time, Moran stood in the 1992 general election in Carshalton and Wallington, finishing in third place. Moran was also the director of \\"Housing for Women' a housing association, national president of the housing branch of the NALGO trade union, vice chair of the Association of London Authorities and vice chair and chair of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities. Parliamentary career For the 1997 election, she was selected to stand for Labour in Luton South through an all-women shortlist. At the election she was elected, gaining the seat from the Conservatives. Following her re-election in the 2001 election she was promoted to the position of assistant whip attached to HM Treasury between 2003 and 2005. While serving as a whip, Moran was obliged to vote along with the government line, and did so. She was re-elected for a third term in the 2005 election, with a reduced majority. There had been significant opposition among Luton's large Muslim population to her support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Moran supported plans to negotiate with Spain over the status of Gibraltar, describing Gibraltar as \\"effectively an outpost colony within a major European partner\\", although she accepted that any change must have the consent of Gibraltarians.Hansard HC 6ser vol 374 col 75WH. From 2006, Moran was a member of the Home Affairs Committee, where she took an interest in helping female victims of domestic violence and in issues of child protection. She was for a time chairwoman of the All-Party Group on Domestic Violence and worked with Women's Aid to launch online projects such as WomenSpeak and KidSpeak. Moran's interest in child protection led her to go to the Internet Governance Forum at Rio de Janeiro in November 2007 and she was involved in the launch of the UK Internet Governance Forum. on 6 March 2008. Moran became a member of the Hansard Society Commission on the Scrutiny of Parliament. She also worked with the Fawcett Society producing a publication on women's participation on the internet. Expense fraud Moran's claims for expenses 2004‚Äì05 were ¬£73,198, higher than those of Luton North MP Kelvin Hopkins. However, it was not until May 2009 that the full details of her claims were revealed. These caused Moran to announce she would not stand in the 2010 general election, and she was later barred from doing so by the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party. Speaking in Parliament, the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown described Moran's behaviour as \\"totally unacceptable\\". Unsolicited mail and stationery costs Moran had particularly high spending on stationery and postage and on staff costs. In the run up to the 2005 general election, Moran sent out thousands of unsolicited letters to her constituents. Following a complaint to the Commons authorities about one of the letters, the Assistant Serjeant at Arms Mark Harvey said the letter was \\"a reasonable solicited response\\", but was against the spirit of the regulations. He went on to say, \\"Having discussed this with Ms Moran, I'm confident that there will be no repetition in future.\\" The regulations have since changed and there is now a limit on the postage costs an MP can claim for.  Second home allowance  On 8 May 2009, The Daily Telegraph revealed Moran spent ¬£22,500 of taxpayers' money treating dry rot at her and her partner's seaside house in Southampton, about 100 miles from her Luton South constituency, only days after switching her \\"second home\\" to his Southampton property. Moran's partner had worked in Southampton for 20 years when the claim was made. The parliamentary authorities were concerned that the work broke the \\"spirit\\" of the rules, but advised that it was permissible on three occasions. The Telegraph said the expenses \\"appear to be among the most questionable of any MP,\\" and the BBC said the claims caused \\"widespread public anger\\".

According to Moran, \\"You could argue that I use it to be able to sustain my work. Any MP has to have a proper family life, they have to have support of their partner.\\" On 12 May, just two days after defending using taxpayers' money on her third home, she agreed to repay it, albeit in instalments. In a statement she asserted: \\"I do understand constituents' anger at the current fees regime, which is why I will be repaying the full amount claimed for my home in Southampton.\\" On the same day, The Daily Telegraph alleged that she used ¬£1,104.34 from her incidental office expenses to pay for \\"furniture for her house\\". Despite the repayment, Moran has refused to apologise for her actions and still claims to have done nothing wrong.Local News in Luton, Dunstable and Bedfordshire  Moran blasts PM for castigating her over expenses Moran's local constituency party backed her following revelations over her claims, but asked her to explain her actions. The then chairman, Mahmood Hussain, described her conduct as \\"very questionable\\". Other expense claims On 14 May, The Daily Telegraph reported that Moran had billed the taxpayer almost ¬£4,000 in respect of an employment tribunal case brought by a former member of her staff. The House of Commons fees office agreed that the bill could be paid out of her staffing budget. Outcomes On 18 May 2009, television presenter Esther Rantzen announced that she would stand against Moran in Luton South as an \\"anti-sleaze\\" candidate. Rantzen launched her campaign in July 2009, however she lost her deposit in the 2010 general election. On 28 May 2009, Moran announced that she would not stand at the forthcoming general election, citing the \\"bruising effect upon my friends, my family and my health.\\" Moran also said \\"The House of Commons fees office gave me incorrect advice upon which I acted. They have now apologised.\\" Subsequently, she was barred from standing in the next general election by a disciplinary panel of the Labour Party. In November 2009, Moran's local newspaper, Luton & Dunstable Express, launched a \\"Get Moran Out Now\\" campaign on its front page. It called for her to resign immediately rather than continuing to claim expenses and receiving a big payoff and large pension by remaining in her seat until the general election. The newspaper was critical of Moran's failure to apologise or explain her conduct to her constituents, saying that she had \\"behaved disgracefully\\" and had \\"fleeced taxpayers quite enough\\".Local News in Luton, Dunstable and Bedfordshire  It is time for you to go Moran In December 2009, Gavin Shuker was selected as the Labour candidate to replace Moran and retained the seat in the general election.

She was summoned to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 19 September 2011 where she was reported to have wept throughout the hearing. Moran was sent to Southwark Crown Court for trial on 30 October 2011; she failed to appear and a 'not guilty' plea was entered by default in her absence. A date for the trial of an issue was set for 18 April with a directions hearing set for 15 December. On 15 December 2011, Mr Justice Saunders was informed that psychiatrists considered Moran unfit to plead with the defence contending that the trial should therefore not proceed.

Attempt to remove expenses scandal from Wikipedia page  In 2010 it was reported by the Daily Telegraph that an IP address associated with the Parliamentary estate had been discovered attempting to remove information on Margaret Moran's role in the expenses scandal from her Wikipedia page . As the edits were made from a parliamentary computer, the user received a warning from Wikipedia. Dispatches lobbyist investigation In March 2010, Moran was one of the MPs involved in offering influential political lobbying for financial reward in a sting operation set up by the Channel 4 Dispatches programme. The MPs were secretly filmed discussing how they could assist the interests of a business which had been invented by the programme-makers. In the film, Moran appears to claim to be able to help modify laws on immigration in order to boost the business interests of the fake company. She also claimed that she could call on a \\"girls' gang\\" of female ministers to help, and yet, while she appeared to be enthusiastically courting the fake company, half an hour after the meeting her office told a reporter that she was unavailable to do any work on behalf of her constituents because she was \\"not very well at the moment\\". Moran claimed that \\"This meeting was the beginning of an attempt to rebuild my life\\". On 22 March, she was suspended from holding office in the Labour Party. Labour leader Gordon Brown indicated that there would not be an investigation into the conduct of Moran and the other Labour MPs filmed in the programme. Improper use of House of Commons stationery In May 2009, the Financial Times alleged Moran mis-used stationery to support eQuality Networks Ltdequalitynetworks.org.uk (EQN) T/A eQuality Network, a non-profit group which claims to help impoverished communities. Moran is currently an associate (listed as Margaret Booker). Moran repeatedly used House of Commons headed paper to write letters in support of EQN, without disclosing her involvement with the company. The Financial Times obtained copies of letters written by Moran supporting eQuality Networks' funding bids and personal invitations to eQuality Networks events. Moran denied committing the offence and claimed her husband \\"has no part in the running of the organisation\\". In 2007 a Spanish Court ruled that she had illegally blocked a right of way at her holiday home in Carataunas, Spain, by installing a gate and digging up the path with an excavator.

She used House of Commons headed paper during the dispute, including a note written in Spanish and English which said \\"Please note ‚Äì this road is private & closed. Please remove your motorcycle from our land. Moran family.\\" eQuality Networks In 2007 the Guardian claimed Moran had been exploiting interns insisting they work for the company eQuality Networks rather than doing political work. Similar allegations were levelled at Moran in 2009 following an investigation by the Financial Times. In 2009 it emerged that one of Moran's employees at eQuality Networks had successfully nominated her to the shortlist of MP of the Year at the Women in Public Life Awards, describing her as a \\"forward thinking, modern day suffragette\\".http://www.womeninpubliclifeawards.co.uk/shortlist_info.asp?id=30 Personal life In 2009 she married her long-time partner of 30 years, Michael Booker, who lives and works at the University of Southampton as a safety adviser.

The Tanglewood Festival Chorus (TFC) was organized in the spring of 1970, when founding conductor John Oliver became director of vocal and choral activities at the Tanglewood Music Center, the summer home of the BSO. Originally formed for performances at the BSO's summer home at the behest of the BSO's conductor designate Seiji Ozawa, the Tanglewood Festival Chorus is the official chorus of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Boston Pops Orchestra year-round, performing in Boston, New York and Tanglewood. History In 1970, John Oliver proposed to the management of the Boston Symphony Orchestra that he would create a permanent chorus for the orchestra, which had relied on various area choruses for much of its history. In Oliver's words, \\"To my utter amazement now--I wasn't amazed then, because I was just a brash young man-- they said, 'Go! Form a chorus.'\\" The TFC's first concert was a performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony at Symphony Hall in April 1970 when Leonard Bernstein substituted for William Steinberg who had fallen ill. Bernstein had been engaged to conduct the Ninth as the closing concert of the Tanglewood season that summer and expressed a preference to conduct it at Symphony Hall rather than Beethoven's Fifth Symphony which Steinberg had been scheduled to conduct. In December 1994 the chorus joined Seiji Ozawa and the Boston Symphony Orchestra for tour performances in Hong Kong and Japan, the chorus' first performance overseas. In February 1998, singing from the General Assembly Hall of the United Nations, the chorus represented the Americas when Seiji Ozawa led the Winter Olympics Orchestra with six choruses on five continents, all linked by satellite, in the Ode to Joy from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony to close the Opening Ceremonies of the 1998 Winter Olympics. The chorus joined Pl√°cido Domingo, Susan Graham, and Yo-Yo Ma in performing at the funeral service for Senator Edward Kennedy on August 28, 2009. On March 10, 2015, the Boston Symphony Orchestra announced that Oliver would retire as conductor of the TFC at the end of the summer Tanglewood season. The BSO conducted a chorus conductor search, and announced on February 2, 2017 that British conductor James Burton had been appointed as the TFC's second permanent conductor. Performance practice The full roster includes over 200 singers who volunteer their time and talents. Subsets of the group are selected by Mr. Burton to meet the needs of the repertoire being performed. Typically a performance will involve 90-120 singers. During the Christmas Pops season, approximately 50 singers take the stage for each show. To meet the needs of the BSO, members of the TFC appear in 10-15 Christmas performances each. Recordings The TFC has also collaborated with Seiji Ozawa and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on numerous recordings, including Mahler's Second, Third, and Eighth symphonies, Strauss's Elektra, Schoenberg's Gurre-Lieder, and Bart√≥k's The Miraculous Mandarin, on Philips; Mendelssohn's complete incidental music to A Midsummer Night's Dream, Gabriel Faur√©'s Pavane, on Deutsche Grammophon; and Berlioz's Requiem and La damnation de Faust, Faur√©'s Requiem, and Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades, on RCA Victor Red Seal. Also for Philips, with the BSO under Bernard Haitink's direction, the chorus has recorded Ravel's Daphnis et Chlo√© and Brahms's Alto Rhapsody and N√§nie. They can also be heard on the RCA Victor disc \\"A Splash of Pops\\", as well as on three Christmas albums ‚Äî \\"Joy to the World\\" on Sony Classical and \\"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\\" on Philips, both with John Williams and the Boston Pops Orchestra, and \\"Holiday Pops\\" on RCA Victor with Keith Lockhart and the Boston Pops Orchestra. The Tanglewood Festival Chorus can also be heard on the soundtracks of four movies, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Close Encounters of the Third Kind ~ Director's Cut, Saving Private Ryan and Mystic River. James Taylor's wife is a member of the chorus, some of whom can also be heard as a \\"virtual\\" backing group for his 2007 UK tour. On February 19, 2009, the BSO announced the launch of a new series of recordings on their own label, BSO Classics. Three of the four initial releases, all recorded live in concert, feature the Tanglewood Festival Chorus: William Bolcom's 8th Symphony (which the TFC premiered in 2008), Brahms's Ein Deutsches Requiem, and Ravel's complete Daphnis et Chlo√©. The 2009 Ravel recording was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Classical Album in the nominations announced on December 2, 2009, and won the award for Best Orchestral Performance on January 31, 2010. In 2010, BSO Classics released Tanglewood Festival Chorus: 40th Anniversary, a collection of the group's unaccompanied recordings from its Tanglewood Prelude performances between 1998 and 2005.

Expenses claims On 26 May 2009, Meg Munn was criticised after it was alleged by The Daily Telegraph that her husband, who is also employed part-time as her parliamentary aide, received more than ¬£5,000 over four years of public money claimed for by Members of the Parliamentary Labour Party, including Government Ministers, for assistance completing their personal tax forms. Munn charged the taxpayer for the tax advice she received herself from her own husband. It was alleged that when she published the receipt on her website, she blacked out the portion indicating that her husband was the beneficiary of her expenses. However the blacking out had been done by the House of Commons authorities, presumably in error as they only blacked out his name for one year but left the other three years alone. Munn stated none of the information available on her website had information blacked out by her or any of her staff. Labour MPs have argued that tax advice relating to their work is a legitimate expense, and the Labour Party issued a statement suggesting that \\"Many MPs rightly seek professional assistance and advice where this relates specifically to their role as Members of Parliament and the expense is therefore legitimate and justifiable. The purpose of this is to ensure all tax liabilities connected with parliamentary duties are properly dealt with.\\" Business groups expressed concerns said MPs might be being \\"treated differently\\" to other taxpayers. Saying, \\"If entrepreneurs sought professional tax advice, they had to pay the fee themselves and offset it against any profits on which they paid tax\\". Munn was one of 98 MPs who voted in favour of legislation which would have kept MPs expense details secret. Personal life She is fluent in German and French, conversational Italian and Spanish and is learning basic Arabic and Swahili. Munn has been an active member of the Methodist Church for 30 years. She is married to Dennis Bates.
