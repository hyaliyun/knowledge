In the 17th century a private navigation school was established in S√ºderende by pastor Richardus Petri which was the first of its kind on the island. It improved the situation of the seafaring population considerably and soon other navigators opened own schools across F√∂hr. Although Petri lead the S√ºderende school successfully for many years he never sailed to sea himself. A census in 1787 showed that S√ºderende had 122 inhabitants, 27 of whom were seafarers. Language The common language among the locals is Fering. The language is being kept alive by being passed on to the next generation by many of the inhabitants.

They have traditionally been considered a group within the Cerambycidae. Description The Oxypeltidae do not have any morphologic resemblance with the other cerambycids. The body is massive and characterised by a nice metallic colour, bluish or green on the head and prothorax, and red on the elytra. Their antennae and legs have a blue metallic colour. The head, round and small, has two robustly toothed antennae, the pronotum is furnished with longitudinal crests, and the elytra, covered by strong puncture, are bitoothed at the apex. The posterior wings, membranous, have an unusual violet colour, similar to that of the Cetoniinae, while they are transparent in all other groups of cerambycids. Biology The larvae, typically xylophagous, attack trees of the genus Nothofagus, the vicariant of beeches in the Southern Hemisphere. The adults are diurnal and can often be found on leaves. Systematics They have always been a mystery for specialists since these insects do not show any strong resemblance with other cerambycids. At first placed in the Prioninae due to the lateral ridge of the pronotum, the Oxypeltinae have been separated.

It was founded in 1890 as a seaside resort next to a new ferry port connecting the island to mainland Nordfriesland. The reason for founding this new village was the fear of many islanders of a decline of their Frisian culture due to the influx of tourists from the south. So, many Amrumers thought that concentrating the emerging seaside tourism in a single village would protect the local community from malign influences. Until December 31, 2006, the Wittd√ºn municipality, together with Nebel and Norddorf formed the Amt Amrum.

It is one of the three species of death's-head hawkmoth genus, Acherontia. The species was first described by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1798. It is nocturnal and very fond of honey; they can mimic the scent of honey bees so that they can enter a hive unharmed to get honey. Their tongue, which is stout and very strong, enables them to pierce the wax cells and suck the honey out. This species occurs throughout almost the entire Oriental region, from India, Pakistan and Nepal to the Philippines, and from southern Japan and the southern Russian Far East to Indonesia, where it attacks colonies of several different honey bee species. It has recently become established on the Hawaiian Islands. Larva (2) and pupa (2a) of Acherontia lachesis Description A. lachesis is much larger than Acherontia styx. The segmental bands and grey stripe occupy so much of the abdomen that only small patches of yellow are left. The hindwing has a large black patch at the base. The medial and post-medial bands are so broad that only narrow bands of yellow remain. The ventral side of the abdomen is banded with black and the wings are banded with black and have a spot in the cell of each. the larva differs from A. styx in having blue streaks above the yellow ones; before pupating it turns brown and the oblique streaks disappear. Life history Eggs are laid on a variety of host plants belonging to the families Solanaceae, Verbenaceae, Fabaceae, Oleaceae, Bignoniaceae, and others. Mature larvae can attain a length of 125 mm and occur in green, yellow and brownish- grey colour forms (most commonly grey), with oblique body stripes and a prickly tail horn that is curled at the extreme tip. When molested the caterpillar throws the head and anterior segments of the body from side to side, at the same time making a rapidly repeated clicking noise, which appears to be produced by the mandibles. The larva pupates by pushing its head into the earth, burying itself, and making an ovoid chamber about 15 cm below the surface in which it sheds its skin.

C. Hazard and Company opened a large factory in 1883 at Shrewsbury, NJ, the latter of which also became the adopted home of the Hazard family. It was in Shrewsbury, NJ that Hazard and Company purchased a tract on which it built \\"extensive factories, including handsome offices and one of the best-equipped laboratories in this country.\\" The firm also grew many of its own agricultural produce on this Shrewsbury tract. Among the consumer goods produced by E. C.

At its peak, Hazard and Company was said to have generated annual revenues in the range of $7 to $9 million. In 1907, however ‚Äî two years after E. C.

The character was introduced in the one-hundredth issue, becoming the series' co- lead. An athletic young dancer, Dani becomes the new host of the Witchblade, a mystical gauntlet that grants its host an assortment of powers. The series' story arc then shows the character losing the gauntlet to its original host, but later taking hold of the Angelus, one of the two primal forces of the universe. Fictional character biography Dani, an impulsive but good- hearted young woman, was born in New Orleans. She moved to New York to pursue a dance career and fulfill her childhood dream. However, following graduation, she became increasingly frustrated about the lack of direction in her life. Following a strange dream about a mystical gauntlet, Dani was drawn to an antiques shop owned by the mysterious Curator, who later became a trusted confidant of Dani's. At the antiques shop, Dani encountered Sara Pezzini, who at the time of meeting was the host of the Witchblade (Dani and Pezzini previously encountered each other on the steps of the police department where Sara worked).Witchblade #101 (Dec. 2006) Dani instantly recognized the Witchblade as the mysterious entity in her dreams and impulsively decided to accept it from Sara, who was focused upon motherhood rather than the adventures that accompany the gauntlet. Sara was initially hesitant about handing the Witchblade over to Dani but changed her mind when she noticed how the gauntlet reacted strongly to Dani's presence.Witchblade #103 (Feb. 2007) Dani eventually learned that the Witchblade was actually the balance between two primal forces of the universe ‚Äî a female entity of light known as the Angelus and a male entity of darkness known as the Darkness. She was drawn back home after her father was taken into a hospital. While Dani was enjoying an evening out in New Orleans, she was harassed by three young men and punished them by drawing them into a dark alley and unleashing the Witchblade, almost choking one of them to death. It was then she realized that the Witchblade had a mind of its own and that she would have to exert more control over it.Witchblade #106 (June 2007) Dani was then confronted by a mysterious woman who urged her to go to a nearby graveyard, where she was confronted by rotting and deformed ghosts. They begged Dani to help set them free and explained that the ancient and mystical Madeline Desormeaux, who lived in a large mansion on the edge of the graveyard, had tortured them in life and had bound them to the land in death. Dani agreed and promised to bring Madeline to them for justice. Dani went into the house, and after a brief fight, emerged triumphant. The ghosts then had their revenge on Desormeaux, and were able to move on. The graveyard and the house then disappeared. Dani is left feeling increasingly unsure whether or not she can control the Witchblade. She returned to her father's bedside and was delighted to find him conscious. She promised to stay by his side for a few weeks to help his recovery and then return to New York, resolving to get rid of the Witchblade after her ghostly encounter. However, she would later end up changing her mind. Dani later discovered more about her powers (including the ability of flight) while helping the Magdalena and Jackie Estacado, the host of the Darkness, defend a pregnant Sara. After Sara's life was threatened by giving birth, Danielle returned half of the Witchblade in order to save her.First Born #3 (Nov. 2007) Later, Madame Kostigian, Dani's dance teacher, asked her to take over introductory classes while she returned to Poland to be with her sister, who had cancer. In the first class she taught, Dani met a girl named Finch. While teaching another class with Finch, Dani sensed something wrong and decided to ask Finch why she was so sad lately. Over coffee Finch revealed that her boyfriend, Rock, was trying to turn her into a prostitute. When Dani stated that she may be able to help, Finch excitedly kissed her, surprising Dani. However, Finch immediately apologized and left. While accompanied by Finch, Dani had a brief skirmish with Rock at his apartment, using the Witchblade to frighten him. During this encounter, Rock was accidentally shot and killed by a friend of his who quickly departed. A shaken Dani then went to Sara for help, and the two moved the body into the street, making it look like a suicide. An angry Sara then lashed out verbally, and she and Dani parted ways. The Curator then informed Dani that when the Witchblade was divided, so, too, were its essences. While Dani's half represented the Angelus, Sara's half represented the Darkness. Without balance, the chaotic nature of Sara's half was slowly corrupting her. Dani then considered giving the Angelus half of the Witchblade to Sara, but was told that doing so would not remove the Darkness's influence from Sara's body, as its effects had already become too great. As such, Dani resolved to recover the second half of the entity.Witchblade #126 (April 2009) She set out to confront Sara in a final battle but was defeated and lost her half of the Witchblade. However, the Angelus, having possessed Finch, arrived and saved Dani by possessing her. Unlike the previous hosts, Dani retained her personality and was able to stop the Angelus from killing Sara, using her newfound powers of Light to free her friend from the taint of the Darkness. She leaves New York after parting with Sara on good terms, and heads back to New Orleans with Finch. Dani then returned home to New Orleans and moved into an apartment with Finch. After leaving the apartment, she and Finch were attacked by a multi-headed chimera. Dani was forced to call upon the Angelus but was nearly defeated, only to be saved by Sabine, one of the Angelus' followers. Sabine then took Dani with her to the Angelus' home realm. As the Angelus had not fully taken Dani over, she only retains a vague memory of the Angelus' realm after she was guided by Sabine to the throne room where a copy of the Darkness, pierced by Angelus' spear, was kept. Sabine then talked Dani into planning an attack on Jackie Estacado. However, she rejected the plan, saying that Jackie was a friend. At the last minute she remembered that Finch was left on Earth and returned just in time to save her from two men attempting to rape her.Angelus #2 (March 2010) After the recreation of the universe, Dani is now a police detective in the Special Cases division and serves as Patrick Gleason's partner. However, she was never the host of the Angelus in this universe as the Angelus' essence was spread amongst her warriors like a hive mind before taking Finch as a new host. Powers and abilities=The Witchblade Dani is a professional ballet dancer; as such, she is very agile and dexterous. Dani was the former host of the Witchblade, during which time she possessed all the powers associated with it. The Angelus Dani once wielded the powers of the Angelus, a universal force of order and creation, the equal and opposite of the Darkness. She possessed superhuman strength, speed and durability. She was able to craft beam-like weapons of light, project light-beams, burn objects and people with her touch, and create a semi-organic armor about herself which increased her durability to near-invulnerability. She could also grow wings from the armor giving her self-propelled flight. Additionally, she could manipulate all aspects of order in existence, possessed healing abilities, immortality, teleportation, night-vision, fire manipulation (an extension of her light manipulation ability) and most importantly, the ability to create objects and sentient beings of pure light and fashion them into shapes and functions that she found pleasing. Her powers were limited, however, since functioning in the dark quickly drained her powers and turned anything she created into dust. The source of her light power was the light energy that half the universe is composed of, the same energy also radiated from her body when she used her powers, while her physical abilities were granted to her by her status as an Angelus host.

CPCI was established in 1977 to serve the central Pennsylvania area through ministries that edify and encourage the body of Christ.  Ministries = Way Truth Life Radio  Way Truth Life Radio is non-commercial, listener supported radio broadcasting from two stations in central Pennsylvania. WTLR, 89.9 FM has served Pennsylvania‚Äôs heartland since 1978. WQJU, 107.1, Mifflintown, became CPCI‚Äôs second full power radio station in January, 1993. Serving listeners in an area to the south and east of WTLR‚Äôs broadcast range, WQJU operates as a satellite of WTLR, bringing identical programming to Mifflin, Snyder, Juniata and Perry counties.  Camp Kanesetake  Camp Kanesatake became a part of the ministries of CPCI in 1989 when the board of directors were made aware of the availability of the camp and the need for Christian camping in the central Pennsylvania area. The camp itself has a long legacy of being a source of cultivating learning and Christian growth in young people since its construction in 1923 by the Pennsylvania Sabbath School Association. CPCI's purchase of the camp ensured the continuation of this heritage into the 21st century.  Puppets With a Purpose  Puppets With a Purpose (PWAP) is a Christian-based youth ministry whose purpose is to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ with fellow Christians and non-Christians alike through the use of puppets. From its inception in 1993 to today, PWAP continuously produces short stories mixed with music told by a team of 10-15 puppeteers and assistants. Outreach is a major goal of PWAP. In addition to local performances at churches and youth events, the PWAP team has begun to take missions trips to foreign countries for the purpose of creating new puppet ministry teams in those locations. In 2005 the team traveled to Peru to form a group of Christian puppeteers that are able to minister to the local population. In 2008 the team is planning to travel to Poland to begin a similar ministry there as well.  Ezekiel Forum  The speaker series sponsored by CPCI is known as the Ezekiel Forum. Recent events have included Dr. Peter Jones speaking on the book Da Vinci Code, sponsorship of internationally-known theologian and apologist Ravi Zacharias, and financial teaching from the Biblical Stewardship Series.  Governance  CPCI is governed by an uncompensated board of directors made up of Christian laymen from various area churches. The board reflects CPCI‚Äôs commitment to non- denominational ministry. Although they come from different church and theological persuasions, the directors lay these differences aside in order to work together in a cooperative effort to exalt their Lord.  Registrations and memberships  CPCI is registered as a not-for-profit corporation by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization. It is a member of the Christian Stewardship Association.

It is part of Wexford GAA. It is three miles (5 km) north of Wexford town and runs for approximately 11 miles (18 km) across like a figure eight. The parish consists of the two half parishes of Crossabeg and Ballymurn. The club takes the name of the parishes in which it is based (Parishes of County Wexford Ireland). Early history GAA games have been played in the two half parishes of Crossabeg and Ballymurn since 1886, but the two areas operated independently of one another for the first eighty years of Gaelic games, as each parish had its own team.Crossabeg: a parish and its people, 1998. The club contested the first Wexford senior football final of 1886 losing to Rosslare. The club won the senior football final of 1897. The first hurling highlight was in 1891 when Crossabeg-Ballymurn was Wexford's representative in the All Ireland championship which was lost Ballyduff after extra time. That was Kerry's only All Ireland hurling championship success. The first two decades of the 20th century brought the area to hurling prominence and also proved to be a golden era for the parish as far as the top hurling honours were concerned. Ballymurn recorded a first county title when winning the junior hurling championship of 1908 and this was quickly followed by senior success in 1910 and 1911. Crossabeg captured the Junior hurling title of 1914 and Ballymurn won it for the second time in 1916. Crossabeg were senior hurling champions in 1918 which was the last title they won as a separate club. Ballymurn won the minor hurling championship of 1929 which was quickly followed by an Intermediate hurling title in 1930. They played senior hurling in the early 1930s and during that time they won the Echo Shield an important competition of that era. Ballymurn then followed Crossabeg back into the junior grade where both half parishes operated for over 30 years very much independent of each other with little if any inter change of players. There were no titles won and in some years a team might not be fielded at all, resulting in players throwing in their lot with neighbouring perishes, but never together. The names of players from the Crossabeg and Ballymurn parishes are to be found playing with other teams in the surrounding areas such as Sallybeachers, Ardcolm, New Irelands, Oylegate, Glenbrien, Shelmaliers, Glynn and the Faythe Harriers throughout this period. Current Club As the clubs entered the 1960s a number of people led by Michael Sinnott and Cauley Gordan decided it was time to unite under one club to serve the area and so in 1966 the present day Crossabeg Ballymurn came into being. The new club entered a team in the junior championship but it took a number of years to gain any semblance of success. In the early 1970s championship success was halted by St Fintains in the Wexford District final for three years in a row . In 1972 a first Wexford district junior hurling title was won when they beat St Fintans in the final. The club went on to contest its first county final that year losing out to Cloughbawn in the final. Despite the loss the ambition of the club was aroused and in the following year a restructuring of hurling in the county saw the club opting to go up to the Intermediate grade which would lead to a 15-year quest filled with heartache and disappointment as the club sought to win its first adult title as a one parish club. They contested the 1974 intermediate final losing on a replay to Gorey. They were beaten semi finalists in 1976, and were beaten in the final of 1977 by a rising St Martins side. For the next ten years the club was always listed as one of the seasons fancied sides but the breakthrough never came. In the meantime at underage level the club lost the 1973 minor hurling final to Rathnure / Duffry Rovers when teamed up with neighbours Oylegate. Two years later they won the U21 hurling title when joined with the Shelmaliers beating Gorey in the final. In 1980 they united with Oylegate to win the Minor B hurling, beating ferns in the final, and again won the U21 hurling in 1982, beating a star-studded Rathnure / Cushinstown in the final. The club went it alone in 1986 and captured the U21B hurling title. The underage teams of the early 1980s contained the players who would carry the club forward into the 1990s. The tale of woe in adult finals continued in 1984 when Gorey beat the junior B hurlers in the final. In 1985 it was the junior B footballers who beat Castletown in the final to record a first adult success in football after all the effort to win a hurling title. However, as in the previous century the win signaled a change of fortune. The Intermediate hurlers contested a first final in ten years when they lost the 1987 final to near neighbours Glynn / Barntown. The club was back the following year to beat Shamrocks in the final and to record a first adult hurling success in the parish for fifty eight years. This victory also saw the parish return to the top senior grade of Wexford hurling. The club more than held its own at senior level and in 1994 narrowly lost the senior semi final to Oulart/ Ballagh who went on to record their own first senior win. At underage level in 1994 the club contested its first premier minor hurling final as a single club losing out to Rathnure. In 1995 the junior B hurlers won the final at the third attempt beating the Rapparees in the final having lost the 1989 final to Bannow / Ballymitty. This was the high tide mark of the club as each year that followed saw a gradual slippage until in 2000 the club was relegated from senior ranks. Worse was to follow when in 2003 saw the team relegated to junior ranks for the first time in thirty years. The years since 2003 has seen the club founder in the junior ranks, and has been a traumatic time for all involved as every one adjusted to their new status. Out of recent disappointment has come a renewed focus and determination to climb the hurling ladder once again however long it takes. The club reached the junior hurling final of 2006 where they lost by a point to Our Lady's Island . Six members of the 2000 U12 hurling winning team were members of the 2006 junior hurling panel. In 2008 the club were knocked out of the junior championship but went on to claim the junior shield when beating Geraldine O'Hanrahans, their first adult cup in thirteen years. Planning for the future at underage The club has enjoyed some success at underage level in the 1990s when they won 5 titles at various grades and over the seven years of the new century have added a further seven titles from u12 level up, including a first underage football title for the U12's. The underage players are starting to flow into the adult teams and there is a good feeling about the future again and as ever in Crossabeg Ballymurn success is not immediate but there is a determination to work hard at it, and to carry on the tradition of Gaelic games in the parish into a third century.

It is set in Washington, DC and focuses on homicide detective Gus Ramone, and ex-cops Dan \\"Doc\\" Holiday and TC Cook as they investigate the possible return of a serial killer. Plot introduction Set in the 1980s, a trio of murders is linked to a single suspect. All three victims have palindromic first names and are found shot through the head in community gardens. The media dubs the crimes the \\"palindrome murders\\". TC Cook was the lead investigator at the time, and two young officers, Gus Ramone and Doc Holiday, were with him at the third crime scene. 20 years later Cook is retired, and Holiday has left the police force. Ramone is a veteran homicide detective and becomes involved in a case which has all the hallmarks of a palindrome murder. Also realizing the similarities, the others are again drawn into the investigation. Explanation of the novel's title The perpetrator of the palindrome murders was nicknamed \\"The Night Gardener\\" by detectives. Characters Gus Ramone is a veteran of the homicide unit and a family man married to Regina, with two children, Diego and Alana. Gus is Italian-American while Regina is African-American. Regina works as a teacher, but when she met Gus she was a police officer. Diego's friends include Shaka Brown, Ronald and Richard Spriggs, and Asa Johnson. Their neighbours include Marita Bryant, and Asa's parents Terrance and Helena Johnson. Diego has recently changed schools and is often in trouble for minor infractions with the assistant principal Mr. Guy and principal Ms Brewster. His old principal, Ms. Cynthia Best, and teachers, Robert Bolton and Andrea Cummings, continue to work with his friends. TC Cook is a retired homicide detective, lives alone, and is recovering from a stroke. He remains obsessed with the palindrome murders and his primary suspect Reginald Wilson. Dan \\"Doc\\" Holiday is a bachelor, and since leaving the police has started a chauffeur and security firm. He left the police force under the cloud of impending morals charges being investigated by Ramone. Holiday is a regular at Leo Vazoulis' bar, and his drinking associates include salesman Jerry Fink, freelance writer Bradley West, and residential contractor Bob Bonano. Doc remains friends with officer James Ramirez. Rhonda Willis, Ramone's partner, is a single mother and devout Christian. The homicide squad includes detectives Paul \\"Bo\\" Green, Anthony Antonelli, Mike Bakalis, Eugene Hornsby, George Loomis, and Bill \\"Garloo\\" Wilkins. They work with Assistant U.S. Attorneys Margaret Healy and Ira Littleton. The squad is also working on the murder of Jacqueline Taylor; their main suspect is Tyree Williams. Rhonda is the primary on the murder of Jamal White. Her investigation includes his friend Leon Mayo, his girlfriend Darcia Johnson, and her roommate Shaylene Vaughn. Shaylene and Darcia work for a pimp called Dominique Lyons. Crooks: Conrad Gaskins and Romeo Brock are stick-up men who make their living robbing drug dealers. Gaskins is a parolee and is dubious about his lifestyle. Brock is young, arrogant, and motivated entirely by the prospect of building his reputation. They use drug addict Ivan \\"Fishhead\\" Lewis for information. Fishhead is also a confidential informant for corrupt police officer Grady Dunne. Brock and Gaskins' next target is drug dealer Tommy Broadus. Broadus' girlfriend is named Chantel Richards. Broadus is supplied clandestinely by kingpin Raymond Benjamin. He uses drug mule Edward Reese to bring Broadus his supply. Reese is the son of Benjamin's sister, Raynella. Benjamin also employs enforcers Michael \\"Mikey\\" Tate and Ernest \\"Nesto\\" Henderson. Plot The novel opens in 1985 at the scene of the discovery of a third victim of the \\"Night Gardener\\" so called by the homicide investigators, and establishes Cook as the lead investigator with Ramone and Holiday as rookies. All three victims of the killer were found in community gardens, shot in the head after being similarly assaulted. Twenty years later Holiday has left the force and Ramone has become a homicide detective. Ramone is working with his squad on the murder of Jacqueline Taylor. They manage to arrest and extract a confession from her boyfriend Tyree Williams which is backed by physical evidence. At home Ramone enjoys a happy family life and tries to mentor his son through the prejudices of his new school. Holiday now works as a chauffeur, drinks in a bar and is unmotivated. One night after cruising, drinking and getting lost, Holiday falls asleep in his car near a community garden. He witnesses some events before sleeping again and awakes to find the body of Asa Johnson with a gunshot wound to the temple. Holiday makes an anonymous call to the police. Bill \\"Garloo\\" Wilkins is the primary investigator on the Johnson case. Ramone becomes involved because of the boy's friendship with his son. He begins to notice similarities to the palindrome murders but says nothing. The Johnson family pressures Ramone to find a suspect. Evidence and the autopsy show a link with the palindrome murders. Wilkins uncovers evidence that Johnson was homosexual on his home computer. Ramone recognises Holiday's voice on the tape of the anonymous call and tracks him down. Holiday also realises the similarity to the palindrome murders and contacts Cook. Now retired and afflicted by a small stroke, Cook continues to trail the early suspect Reginald Wilson. Wilson went to prison shortly after the last murder in the 80s and Cook still believes Wilson is the \\"Night Gardener\\". He is invigorated by the possibility of another chance to prove his theory and eagerly joins Holiday in an unofficial investigation. Ramone arranges to meet with Cook and Holiday. Holiday is truthful about everything he saw on the night of Johnson's death and Cook tells Ramone about his suspicions over Wilson but it turns out that Wilson has an alibi for the night in question. The night after the Johnson killing Ramone's partner, Rhonda Willis becomes the primary investigator on a new case, the murder of Jamal White. They find that the same gun was used in the deaths of White and Johnson. Through a tangled chain of connections detectives trace and arrest Aldan \\"Beano\\" Tinsley who, under pressure, confesses to finding the gun when walking through the gardens - after Asa Johnson shot himself. Remembering the number of the patrol car from his night near the gardens, Holiday manages to identify the officer driving as Grady Dunne without Ramone's help. Ramone meets Holiday and tells him that Johnson's death was not related to the palindrome murders. Ramone convinces Holiday to identify Tinsley as the man he saw in the gardens on the night of Johnson's death in order to strengthen the White case because he abused Tinsley's rights in order to get the information he needed. Holiday is surprised to find that Ramone is not as straight as he believed. Ramone returns to the gardens and finds Asa Johnson's journal hidden near where his body was found. He reads the diary in full and finds that Johnson had a relationship with a man who used the pseudonym \\"RoboMan\\". Ramone believes this was Johnson's math teacher Robert Bolton. Ramone resolves to trace the origins of the gun Johnson used, finding it belonged to Terrance Johnson which he remains quiet about. Instead he passes the information about the teacher on to the Morals Unit. Holiday keeps the information about Johnson's suicide from Cook as he is worried it will demoralise him. Holiday and Cook follow Dunne to the gas station where Wilson works and are excited at the potential connection. They split up and Holiday confronts Dunne and realises that while he is corrupt he was not involved in Johnson's death. Holiday resolves to tell Cook the truth. Cook follows Wilson and then goes to his home with plans to break in. Cook approaches the house but becomes suddenly unwell and passes away in his car outside. Holiday tells Ramone that Cook is missing and eventually finds his body. Holiday moves it to another location to avoid the press saying that Cook was still obsessed with the palindrome case. Blaming himself for Cook's death, he resolves to break into Wilson's home himself. In an unrelated drug shootout, Dunne is on the take, and in the melee, Brock, Benjamin and Dunne are killed and Henderson flees. The novel closes with a return to 1985 and the revelation that Wilson was responsible for the palindrome murders, hiding trophies from each victim in his record collection.  Major themes  Pelecanos has stated that family is a major theme in the novel.  Critical reception  The book received very good reviews from critics. The review aggregator Metacritic reported the book had an average score of 90 out of 100, based on 18 reviews.

The second ship to be named Guide by the Navy, AM-447 was launched 17 April 1954 by the Seattle Shipbuilding & Drydocking Corp., Seattle, Washington; sponsored by Miss Ann L. Larson; and commissioned 15 March 1955, Lt. John E. Lowell in command. Her hull classification changed from AM-447 to MSO-447 on 7 February 1955.  West Coast operations  Guide spent the first year of her career in coastwise operations off California. This duty included surveys for the Navy Hydrographic Office in the San Diego- Long Beach area and in San Francisco Bay approaches. She departed Long Beach, California, 1 October 1956 and arrived in Yokosuka 31 October for minesweeping exercises that took her off the coast of Korea, the Marianas Islands, and along the coast of Japan. She returned to Long Beach 15 April for 2 years of training along the western seaboard. On 2 April 1959 she again deployed for the Far East, expanding duties to include joint mine exercises with the naval forces of Japan, Korea and Nationalist China. Guide returned to Long Beach from her second Asian tour 15 October 1959 and resumed operations along the California seaboard for the next 2 years. On 1 May 1961 she sailed on her third tour of duty with the U.S. 7th Fleet, arriving in Yokosuka, Japan, 29 May 1961. Following amphibious and other mine warfare exercises to the coasts of Korea and the Philippines, she returned to Long Beach 14 November. The next 16 months were filled with mine countermeasure and minesweeping training that took her as far north as Seattle and Esquimalt, British Columbia.  Continued Far East operations  Guide in 1954. Guide was again underway for the Far East 5 April 1963, touching Midway Island and the Marianas on her way to Japan. She again swept to the shores of Taiwan, Korea, and the Philippines before returning to Long Beach 5 November 1963. Coastwise training occupied her until 5 April 1965 when she sailed for Guam, Marianas Islands, arriving 3 May 1965.  Supporting Vietnam crisis operations  Guide underwent a 3-week upkeep period at Guam. She arrived off the coast of Vietnam 1 June to begin the first of three periods of \\"Operation Market Time\\" anti-infiltration patrols to deny movement of war supplies to the Viet Cong. Her first patrol terminated 30 June. Subsequent patrols were carried out 25 July-12 August 1965 and 18 September-5 October 1965. Following a liberty call at Hong Kong, she paid a 2-day visit to Iloilo City, Panay, Republic of the Philippines. She opened for general visiting 25‚Äì28 October and contributed books and food to assist in America's people-to-people program of international friendship. The Guide returned to the waters off Viet Nam for additional patrols in late 1969 and early 1970. While on patrol the ship and crew engaged the enemy in a ship- to-shore fire-fight that resulted in the crewmembers being awarded the Combat Action Medal.  Joint naval exercises in the Philippines  Guide joined in combined mine warfare exercises with units of the Philippine Navy before setting course for the Marshalls, Hawaii, and back to Long Beach, arriving 14 December 1965.

Affiliated with the Episcopal Church, the school was named for the Bishop Thomas Fielding Scott. The school opened in 1870 to educate young men in good citizenship and prepare them to enter the ministry. Later a military department was added to the school before the academy closed in 1904. The school organized the first American football team and held the first football game in the Pacific Northwest in 1889. Prior schools= Trinity School for Boys  The academy was related to an earlier attempt by Scott to found a diocesan school. The Reverend William Richmond had started a school at Yamhill in 1852.Robson says that Richmond's school started at Yamhill, was moved to Milwaukie, then to Lake Oswego. Bishop Scott moved Richmond's school to present-day Lake Oswego, Oregon, where Scott had purchased 70 acres that included a school building dating to 1850. Here Scott established the Diocesan School for Boys. Bernard Cornelius, a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin, was appointed in 1856 by Scott as principal over 17 boarders. A primary department opened in 1858, and the school was renamed Trinity School for Boys. The school offered \\"both religious and secular education\\". Cornelius resigned in 1860, and the school closed for two years. In 1862 it reopened under leadership of the Reverend Michael Fackler. Although Cornelius returned to the reigns in 1863, he could not halt declining enrollment. Trinity school closed in 1866Tyler says the school closed in 1865. and the trustees sold the property.Corning, Howard M. 1956. Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing. Funds and property were provided to Scott's successor, Bishop B. Wistar Morris, to establish another school, but located in Portland, Oregon. The land comprised 38 city lots along 19th Street, between Couch and Everett Streets in Portland. The donors were Captain George H. Flanders and his sister, Mrs. Caroline Couch (wife of John H. Couch). Morris laid the cornerstone on July 5, 1870.  Bishop Scott Grammar and Divinity School  The Bishop Scott Grammar School in 1874 The newly completed Bishop Scott Grammar and Divinity School opened as a boarding and day-school for boys on September 6, 1870, under principal Charles H. Allen. Comprising three storeys above a basement, the building housed 2 classrooms, recitation rooms, a parlour, library, 16 rooms for boarders, a suite for the principal and his family, and its own chapel, called Saint Timothy's. Although the total costs amounted to $15,000, no debt remained. A year after opening the school had a new head master: Professor R. W. Laing, M.A., L.L.D., assisted by the Reverend George Burton. By 1873 the property was valued at $30,000, after the addition of the chapel, school rooms, and the dormitory. Costs were defrayed from tuition fees of $150 per annum, and interest from an $7,000 endowment‚Äîthe proceeds from the sale of the Oswego property. Eighty pupils attended school, thirteen down from the previous year, drawn from Oregon, Washington, California, Utah, Alaska, and British Columbia. The faculty comprised three teachers: Junior Master, William M. Barker; Primary Master, Mr. Grant; and Senior Master, Rev. A. N. Wrixon. As chaplain, Burton conducted services \\"in the large schoolroom of the Grammar School\\" at 10.30am, and Sunday School at 2pm in August. At the start of Christmas Term on 1 September, Rev. Burton, now rector of Trinity Parish, was ensconced as head master. As it had been since 1870, the school was still administered directly by Bishop Morris. Subjects included modern languages, music, singing, drawing, chemistry, and penmanship. Oregon's superintendent of education found that the grammar school's \\"philosophical and chemical apparatus [were] unsurpassed in the State\\", and mentioned that the school library contained 1,500 books. The school had replaced almost all its faculty by 1874, and added women to the staff for the first time. Laing and Barker continued, alongside the new head master and chaplain, Rev. D'Estaing Jennings, M.A. Miss I. A. Buss was added as \\"Preceptress\\" (female teacher), and Matron Maria Emery had been appointed. A military tone was introduced, in the form of Drill Master R. R. Anderson and the organization of the Bishop Scott Cadets. Drilling was viewed not only in terms of military preparedness, but as a form of exercise.Other newly appointed faculty included drawing teacher Edward T. Coleman and music teacher Richard T. Yarndley. On 8 November 1877 the grammar school was heavily damaged by fire. Before fire almost destroyed the library and equipment, the enrollment stood at 43 day pupils and 40 boarders. Joseph Wood Hill (b. 1856), in ca. 1905. Joseph Wood Hill was the new principal when the rebuilt school opened on the same premises in September 1878. Burton had been deposed by Bishop Morris in May that year. The new building was smaller than the one it replaced, although \\"admirable\\" and \\"of superior architectural character\\", to fit in with the homes in the surrounding area. Hill was a native of Westport, Connecticut, having attained a BA from Yale University earlier in 1878. He had responded to an address that Bishop Scott gave to a class at Yale. Noah Porter, Yale's president, recommended Hill for his character, teaching experience, and maturity. After his appointment, Hill studied medicine at Willamette University's College of Medicine in Portland, graduating as an MD in 1881. At college he rowed, and became a member of the Gamma Nu fraternity. Only five boarding pupils attended the school at the start, and there were \\"less than twenty pupils, all told\\". Hill leased the school building from the bishop, and later from the board of trustees that had been appointed when Oregon became a separate diocese in 1889. Echoing the beliefs of Bishop Scott in the value of private over public education, Hill modelled the school after the private boarding schools on the east coast, like the one that he himself had attended. He filled the initial faculty vacancies with Yale graduates, such as John W. Gavin and English teacher Allan Elsworth. At the same time he did subsidize from his own pocket those students for whom the $300 annual fees were a hardship. Hill spent his vacations visiting exemplary private schools throughout the United States, and gradually became convinced that military discipline was essential for the Academy. In 1886, he declared that pupils should wear uniforms. Illustrating the amount of control the principal was granted by Bishop Morris, Hill renamed the school the Bishop Scott Academy in 1887. A military department was added, and the Academy became the first school on the West Coast to adopt military discipline. Hill had an armory built that measured 5,000 square feet‚Äî\\"the largest indoor space in Portland\\" for some time. Although intended as a drill hall, the armory was also used for dances, which Hill believed would provide cadets with a graceful posture. A 1900 newspaper advertisement for the Academy In order to promote military training, the federal government loaned weapons to schools which employed a qualified officer as military commandant. Hill appointed Lieutenant Colonel F. E. Patterson in 1887 as instructor in mathematics and military tactics. Consequently, the steamship Oregon brought Springfield rifles and \\"two 3-inch rifled field pieces and carriages\\" in 1890 to the Academy \\"from the Benicia arsenal, California\\". Academy cadets could now learn how to use light artillery. In 1891 the Academy became the first school permitted to sit Yale University's entrance examinations without direct supervision of Yale faculty. The uniforms for the intake of 234 students that year were supplied by Thomas Kay Woolen Mills' store in Salem. Gavin organized the first football team in the Northwest at the Academy, which held the first football game in the Northwest in 1889. Gavin had learned to play while studying at Yale. Until that time, rugby union had been the preferred form of football at the school. Like many institutions across the United States, the school was badly affected by the economic depression that followed the Panic of 1893. Hill recalled that he had 70 pupils by June 1893; but in September only 12 returned when the school re-opened. The principal's own financial state also suffered due to the Panic, his investment in real estate, and the general contraction of the Oregon economy. Hill tried to deflect the impact by assigning the lease of the school to the diocesan secretary, thus placing the Academy out of the reach of his debtors. He also transferred some of his properties to his wife. Desiring to further formalize the military aspect of the Academy, Hill asked for a serving officer to be assigned. Accordingly, the federal War Department appointed Captain W. A. Kimball in 1895. The United States Army now in effect controlled the Academy's military section. When the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War broke out, 30 alumni from the Academy served, fourteen as commissioned officers. The school also became the first in the Pacific Northwest to implement the Sloyd system of instruction, with Hill personally contributing financially to the purchasing in 1895 of the required equipment. 1903 advertisement for Bishop Scott Academy After 23 years of service, Hill retired in 1901 after a disagreement with the school's board of trustees. Some of the trustees had argued that the diocese should operate the school. They said that the diocese had acted outside its legal limits in granting a lease to Hill. Not wishing to become an employee of the diocese, Hill departed on amiable terms. His first wife, Jessie K. Adams, died in 1901. Hill married Laura E. MacEwan, the widow of the Academy's chaplain, that same year. Originally a Democrat, Hill shifted allegiance to the Republican party in 1896, due to his support for the gold standard. A Freemason, Hill obtained the Knights Templar degree of the York Rite. He started the Hill Military Academy elsewhere in the city, and later became an agent for President William Howard Taft. Arthur C. Newill, who had read classics at Balliol College, Oxford, was appointed as Hill's successor. The Academy's enrollment declined after having reached 234 in 1901, and under financial pressure the Diocese closed the school in 1904. Subsequently, several unsuccessful attempts were made to revive the Academy in Yamhill County, Oregon. For example, in June 1913 The Ontario Argus announced that \\"the Bishop Scott Grammar School for Boys\\" would reopen in September, north of Yamhill.  Faculty, 1870-1904  * Right Rev. B.

Hitler: Speeches and proclamations, 1932-1945. Bolchazy-Carducci, 2004. P. 2777. Biography Gariboldi was born in Lodi, Lombardy. From the end of World War I and through the interwar Period, Gariboldi rose in the ranks and held various staff, regimental, and brigade level commands. Abyssinia In 1935, Gariboldi commanded the 30th Infantry Division \\"Sabauda\\" on the northern front during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. His division was part of the I Corps based in Eritrea. After Italy defeated Ethiopia (Abyssinia) in May 1936, Eritrea, Abyssinia, and Italian Somaliland were joined to form the colony of Italian East Africa on 1 June 1936. North Africa General Rommel with Governor-General Gariboldi (on Rommel's right), Libya 1941 From 1939 to 1941, Gariboldi served as an army commander in Marshal Italo Balbo's \\"Supreme Command - North Africa\\". When Italy declared war in June 1940, Gariboldi commanded the Italian Fifth Army stationed on the border with French Tunisia. He ultimately commanded both armies located in Libya. After the Battle of France ended, the Fifth Army became a source of men, parts, and supply for the Italian Tenth Army on the border with Egypt. In December 1940, when the British launched Operation Compass, Gariboldi was in temporary command of the Tenth Army because General Mario Berti was on sick leave. Ultimately, he was given command of the Tenth Army after it was virtually destroyed and Berti's replacement General Giuseppe Tellera was killed in action. On 25 March 1941, Gariboldi was promoted to Governor-General of Libya and replaced Marshal Rodolfo Graziani. By 19 July, Gariboldi himself was relieved because of his alleged lack of cooperation with Rommel. General Ettore Bastico took his place. Russia From 1942 to 1943, Gariboldi commanded the Italian Army in Russia (Armata Italiana in Russia, or ARMIR, or Italian 8th Army). He was in command of the Italian Army in Russia during the destruction of that army during the Battle of Stalingrad. Italy In 1943, Gariboldi was in Italy when King Victor Emmanuel III and Marshal Pietro Badoglio ousted dictator Benito Mussolini and then signed an armistice with the Allies.

The toboggan chute is located in Camden, Maine, at the Camden Snow Bowl, a community-owned year-round recreation area which has developed thousands of dedicated skiers since 1936. All race revenue goes to off-setting the Snow Bowl budget. History The original chute was built in 1936 by volunteers who also built a ski lodge and ski hill, one of the earliest in America. The chute was rebuilt in 1954 by local Coast Guardsmen and lasted until 1964 when it was brought to an end because of rot and neglect. In 1990 it was resurrected once again out of pressure treated wood by another group of volunteers and material donors and became known as the Jack Williams Toboggan Chute.

Early Years in North Carolina  Lindley was born in Alamance County, North Carolina (then still part of Orange County) on June 15, 1756, to Thomas and Ruth Lindley, Quaker immigrants from County Wicklow, Ireland. The Lindleys had first lived in Chester County, Pennsylvania, but moved to the Piedmont region of North Carolina, where they settled on Cane Creek, a tributary of the Haw River, near the town of Saxapahaw at a spot later known as Lindley's Mill.http://woodlin.net/lindley/2026.htmhttp://woodlin.net/lindley/2285.htm The Battle of Lindley's Mill, fought between Loyalists and Patriot militias on Thomas Lindley's property, was the last battle of the Revolutionary War in North Carolina. According to family tradition, Thomas Lindley died the following day from the shock of the battle waged on his land.http://www.ourstate.com/lindleys-mill/ Like many North Carolina families, the Lindleys were torn apart by the war. Jonathan's brother James, who was twenty years older and had settled in upcountry South Carolina, served as a prominent Loyalist militia captain. James Lindley was taken prisoner at the Battle of Ninety-Six and executed for treason in the battle's aftermath. James' son William, of Chatham County, commanded Loyalist militia during the battle waged at his grandfather's mill. After the British evacuated Wilmington, William Lindley headed west to the Blue Ridge Mountains with the brutal Loyalist Colonel David Fanning, and was then murdered by Loyalist deserters in January 1782 at the Watauga settlement in eastern Tennessee. (Fanning claimed that William Lindley was \\"cut to pieces with their swords\\" and personally tracked down two of the assassins and hanged them.)http://woodlin.net/lindley/1540.htm Jonathan Lindley went into the lumbering and turpentine business, speculating in wilderness acreage in central North Carolina. He quickly became one of the leading men and merchants of the area. In 1786, Lindley served in the North Carolina General Assembly at Hillsborough, also participating in the state convention that ratified the U.S. Constitution in 1788. Lindley was among the North Carolinians who insisted on amendments to the original Federal constitution, which resulted in the Bill of Rights. He also supported the creation of the University of North Carolina, the first public university in the United States. The school was built on a hill near a chapel not far from Lindley's own property, a spot later called Chapel Hill.http://ncpedia.org/biography/lindley-jonathan As a Quaker with anti-slavery convictions, Lindley introduced several bills to curb slavery, one of which called for an end to the importation of slaves from Africa to North Carolina, a crucial first step toward abolition. The slave trade in North Carolina was outlawed in 1794, partly through Lindley's efforts, though slavery itself survived until the Civil War. Lindley left the General Assembly in 1805.  Settling in Indiana  As new land in the Midwest was opened to settlement, land-hungry Quakers ‚Äì often motivated by their ideals regarding slavery ‚Äì began to move out of the \\"Quaker Belt\\" of the South. By 1808, Jonathan Lindley had already been considering a move west from North Carolina. As a successful landowner and lumber merchant, he was not motivated by the slavery issue alone. The Midwest's unbroken forests were primarily what attracted him north. Indiana Territory attracted many Southerners, in large part due to the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which radically simplified land titles and helped owners secure a clear legal hold on their property. This appealed to settlers from the South, where deeding new land had grown complicated and often led to protracted, even violent, disputes. Lindley and his son Zachariah traveled overland to Indiana Territory in 1808 to prospect for land. Lindley was mesmerized by Indiana's old-growth woodlands. He purchased large tracts of land along the Wabash River in present-day Parke County and initially intended to establish a Quaker colony near Fort Harrison, just north of the future site of Terre Haute. (In 1816, Lindley was still the largest stockholder in Abraham Markle's \\"Terre Haute Company,\\" which platted the town in 1821. Some sources cite him as a founder of Terre Haute.) Zachariah Lindley had established a grist mill on Lick Creek, in the limestone uplands forty miles northwest of Louisville, near what became Paoli, Indiana. Jonathan Lindley returned from North Carolina in 1811 with around twenty families. At least eleven of these families were \\"free colored,\\" descendants of Africans and Lumbee, a Native American tribe in southeastern North Carolina. (The Lumbee often married African Americans and thus came to be classified as \\"colored\\" by the state.) Increasingly stripped of their rights by the Black Codes in the antebellum South, free blacks had compelling reasons to leave and often resettled near Quakers when they moved to the Midwest. Originally intending to settle in the Wabash Valley, Lindley's settlers (numbering 218 people) were turned back by the outbreak of conflict between Tecumseh's Shawnee Confederation and the Indiana militia led by Territorial Governor William Henry Harrison. Turned away from the Wabash Valley, Jonathan Lindley and his family lived first near Richmond, Indiana, then purchased land at Lick Creek in what was later christened Orange County, Indiana, after his North Carolina birthplace. (Lick Creek itself was apparently named for a tributary of the Haw River near the old Lindley Mill in Chatham County, North Carolina. Lindley's Lick Creek settlement, four miles east of the later town of Paoli along the road to Chambersburg, was one of the earliest white settlements in southern Indiana. Many of the free black settlers who moved north with him settled farther back away from the Chambersburg Road, in a remote part of what became the Hoosier National Forest. This settlement is also often referred to as \\"Lick Creek\\" or \\"Little Africa\\" and was abandoned by the early 20th century.http://www.foresthistory.org/ASPNET/Publications/region/9/hoosier/sec1a.htmhttp://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gjAwhwtDDw9_AI8zPyhQoY6BdkOyoCAGixyPg!/?navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&cid;=fsbdev3_017494&navid;=100000000000000&pnavid;=null&ss;=110912&position;=Not%20Yet%20Determined.Html&ttype;=detail&pname;=Hoosier%20National%20Forest-%20Special%20Places In 1814, Lindley became an Indiana territorial court judge. He was a member of Indiana House of Representatives from 1816 to 1817, where he served on a committee to locate a spot for a state university (at that time called Indiana Seminary) in Bloomington. Lindley thus played a role in founding both the University of North Carolina and Indiana University. He died in Orange County on April 5, 1828. His interment was at Old Lick Creek Quaker Cemetery, along U.S. 150 in Chambersburg, Indiana.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/41763504 The Thomas Elwood Lindley House in Paoli was owned by Jonathan Lindley's son and was built in 1869 on land deeded to him in 1812.

They are intended to have the same kind of effects as androgenic drugs but be much more selective in their action, allowing them to be used for more uses than the relatively limited legitimate uses of anabolic steroids. Comparison to testosterone Structure of testosterone Currently used androgens for male hormone replacement therapy are typically injectable or skin delivery formulations of testosterone or testosterone esters. Injectable forms of testosterone esters (such as testosterone enanthate, propionate, or cypionate) produce undesirable fluctuations in testosterone blood levels, with overly high levels shortly after injection and overly low afterward. Skin patches do provide a better blood level profile of testosterone, but skin irritation and daily application still limit their usefulness. SARMs provide the ability to design molecules that can be delivered orally, but that selectively target the androgen receptors in different tissues differently. The goal of research in this area is to allow a customized response: Tissues that are the target of the therapy will respond as they would to testosterone; other tissues where undesirable side-effects are produced will not. None of the SARMs yet developed are truly selective for anabolic effects in muscle or bone tissues without producing any androgenic effects in tissues such as the prostate gland; however, several nonsteroidal androgens show a ratio of anabolic to androgenic effects of greater than 3:1 and up to as much as 90:1 (RAD-140), compared to testosterone, which has a ratio of 1:1. RAD-140 This suggests that, while SARMs are likely to show some virilizing effects when used at high doses (e.g., use by bodybuilders), at lower therapeutic doses they may well be effectively selective for anabolic effects, which will be important if SARMs are to have clinical application in the treatment of osteoporosis in women. One substantial advantage of even the first-generation SARMs developed to date is that they are all orally active without causing liver damage, whereas most anabolic steroids are not active orally and must be injected, and those anabolic steroids that are orally active tend to cause dose-dependent liver damage, which can become life- threatening with excessive use. Research is continuing into more potent and selective SARMs, as well as optimising characteristics such as oral bioavailability and increased half-life in vivo, and seeing as the first tissue-selective SARMs were only demonstrated in 2003, the compounds tested so far represent only the first generation of SARMs and future development may produce more selective agents compared to those available at present. Selectivity in men For example, if the target is bone growth in elderly men with osteopenia or osteoporosis, but with no overt signs of hypogonadism, a SARM targeting bone and muscle tissue but with lesser activity on the prostate or testes would be more desirable. Selectivity in women A SARM for women would ideally stimulate bone retention, or libido and other function that androgens can influence, without negative side-effects such as development of male gender characteristics (virilization), increased LDL/HDL ratios, liver dysfunction, and so forth. Examples=Clinical testing MK-2866 also known as Ostarine or Enobosarm * Enobosarm (Ostarine, MK-2866, GTx-024, S-22) ‚Äì One of the most popular SARMs, affects both muscle and bone, intended mainly for osteoporosis but also general treatment for andropause and reversing muscle sarcopenia in the elderly and for cachexia in cancer patients. * BMS-564,929 ‚Äì Mainly affects muscle growth, intended as general treatment for symptoms of andropause * LGD-4033 (Ligandrol) ‚Äì pharmacological profile similar to that of enobosarm.

In 2017 it was found that many of the supplements being sold claiming to be SARMs do not actually contain the chemical in question. In October 2017, the Food and Drug Administration issued warning letters to three supplement companies notifying them that SARMS are classed as unapproved drugs and can cause potential adverse side effects associated including cardiovascular and liver damage.  Use in sports  In 2015, quarterback of the Florida Gators, Will Grier, allegedly tested positive for Ligandrol, a claim that the University of Florida denies. In 2017, Joakim Noah was banned for twenty games by the NBA for testing positive for Ligandrol. Sean O'Malley, the American mixed martial artist who competes in the Bantamweight division of Ultimate Fighting Championship, was temporarily suspended by the Nevada State Athletic Commission in June 2019 after his sample tested positive for Enobosarm ahead of this fight against Marlon Vera at UFC 239 on July 6 in Las Vegas. In July 2019, tennis player Beatriz Haddad Maia from Brazil received a provisional suspension after she tested positive for selective androgen receptor modulators.

Located in the southwest corner of the block on the northeast corner of North Dearborn Street and West Washington Street, the John M. Van Osdel designed building had been erected in 1872, but was demolished in 1989 during the clearing of what is known as Chicago's Block 37. In order to make way for Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley's redevelopment, the Chicago City Council had to revoke the privately owned building's landmark status in 1987. Property history The McCarthy building was on a piece of land owned by the McCarthy family for 100 years. It was bought by John Patrick McCarthy on May 1, 1847, and he built a home there for his family, which included six children. After the home burned in the Chicago fire of 1871, Mrs. McCarthy built a new home on a triangular tract of land farther south in Chicago, at Cottage Grove Ave. & 35th St., where Vincennes starts. Replacing the burned home was the five-story McCarthy building, which had a fireplace in every room. It had no elevator, but also no mortgage during the time the McCarthys owned it. From 1901 until at least 1947, the building was under lease to the Washington Shirt Co., which sublet the upper floors and two other street-level shops. The building was bought by a syndicate in 1946 for $550,000, the highest per-square-foot price‚Äî$180.92‚Äîin the neighborhood at that time.Chase, Al. Family Sells Property Held for 100 Years: Group Pays $550,000 to McCarthy Heirs Chicago Tribune, August 4, 1946. Revocation of landmark status The revocation of the landmark status was a hotly contested legal battle. In Landmarks Preservation Council v. City of Chicago, (125 Ill. 2d 164 (1988)) the Illinois Supreme Court refused to recognize the standing of several groups to challenge Chicago City Council ordinance that removed landmark status. The court found that the Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois and the Chicago Chapter, American Institute of Architects lacked legal standing to make such a challenge because they could not \\"gain standing merely through a self-proclaimed concern about an issue, no matter how sincere.\\" The court specifically rejected, as bases for standing, both the aesthetic interests of these parties and their \\"alleged right to participate in a public hearing\\" regarding the ordinance where the \\"municipality has bestowed that alleged procedural right apparently not as a legal entitlement but as a tool to assist the municipality in performing its legislative function.\\" 22 West Washington The long-delayed Block 37 retail and office complex opened in 2009.

Fetal and maternal blood supply are typically connected in utero with one vein and two arteries to the fetus. The umbilical vein is responsible for delivering oxygen rich blood to the fetus from the mother; the umbilical arteries are responsible for removing oxygen poor blood from the fetus. This allows for the fetus‚Äô tissues to properly perfuse. PUBS provides a means of rapid chromosome analysis and is useful when information cannot be obtained through amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, or ultrasound (or if the results of these tests were inconclusive); this test carries a significant risk of complication and is typically reserved for pregnancies determined to be at high risk for genetic defect. It has been used with mothers with immune thrombocytopenic purpura. History PUBS is a type of fetal blood sampling which was originally developed to determine the presence of hereditary abnormalities. Currently, it can detect a number of abnormalities including pH levels, oxygen levels, chromosomal issues, and infections. In 1958, James L.S. recognised that umbilical cord blood gas analysis can give an indication of preceding fetal hypoxic stress. It has since become widely accepted that umbilical cord blood gas analysis can provide important information about the past, present and possibly the future condition of the infant. PUBS dates back to 1964 when Freda and Adamsons reported the removal of a uterus containing a fetus who had a buildup of fluid and ended up dying; however, this was one of the first procedures that showed promise for current day PUBS. Valenti hypothesized in 1972 that the procedure he used to obtain fetal tissue could be used to obtain fetal blood, and in 1973, he was able to sample fetal vessels; fetoscopy was used and refined between 1974 and 1983 as a prenatal test to determine fetal status as well as obtain fetal blood and perform transfusions in some cases. Fetoscopy is a procedure in which a device is inserted through the abdomen of the mother in order to visualize the fetus. The first documented use of PUBS came in 1983 by Daffos and colleagues who sampled blood from an umbilical vein with a needle and monitored its maneuvers with an ultrasound. PUBS has presented a more successful and less dangerous alternative to fetoscopy, which had a miscarriage risk of 5-10%. With the development of modern medicine and new techniques, PUBS is not used often except when rapid diagnosis and decisions must be made in regards to the fetus and suspected abnormalities suspected. PUBS has been predominantly replaced by Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) which is a more detailed investigation of chromosomal abnormalities. Procedure If the fetus is viable, the procedure is performed close to an operating room in case an emergency cesarean section is necessary due to complications caused by the procedure. Currently, there is no definite age of viability because this depends on the fetus‚Äô ability to survive outside the womb, which in cases of premature births, can depend on access to medical care and technology needed to keep the fetus alive through the neonatal stage. Fetal viability typically occurs at about 24 to 25 weeks of gestation. When the fetus is in between the ages of 24‚Äì34 weeks, a glucocorticoid is given to the patient about 24 hours before the procedure to stimulate lung maturity. An ultrasound is performed before the procedure to view the position of the fetus and may be used during the procedure to help guide the needle. The mother‚Äôs blood is drawn for comparison against fetal blood, and intravenous access is established in the mother in order to supply medications as needed. To reduce the risk of intraamniotic infection, antibiotics are supplied through the intravenous access about 30‚Äì60 minutes before the procedure. If movement of the fetus is a risk to the success of the procedure, the fetus may be paralyzed using a fetal paralytic drug. This image shows anterior blood sampling from the umbilical cord. This image shows posterior blood sampling from the umbilical cord. A 20 or 22 gauge spinal needle is typically used in PUBS and may be prepared with an anticoagulant, which helps to reduce the risk of clot formation. During the procedure, the first step is to locate a relatively stable segment of the umbilical cord. A typical sampling site would be where the segment of the umbilical cord is closest to the placenta. However, there is a risk of maternal blood contamination at this site. Blood sampling may be achieved with more ease if the placenta is in the anterior position. However, if the placenta is in the posterior position, the fetus might block direct access to the umbilical cord. Once the umbilical cord is reached and the correct position of the needle is confirmed, the fetal blood is drawn. The needle is removed after all necessary samples are taken. The site of puncture is monitored after the procedure for bleeding. Also, if the fetus is viable, fetal heart rate is monitored post- procedure for one to two hours. After the blood samples are obtained, they are placed into tubes containing anticoagulants in order to stop the blood from clotting. If the blood sample was obtained at the site close to the placenta, a fetal blood confirmation test should be done to ensure no mixing of fetal and maternal blood occurred before the diagnostic tests are done on the blood. Fetal red blood cells (RBC) are usually bigger than maternal RBCs, and the average volume of RBCs, the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), is one of the methods used to determine whether or not the fetal blood has been contaminated. Another method, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) determination, can detect maternal blood because maternal blood has high levels of hCG. The hemoglobin alkaline denaturation test (Apt test) can detect the presence of maternal blood, which is indicated by a color change from red to brown when the sample is added to alkali reagent. Blood typing would also detect maternal blood, as the I antigen only occurs in adults. The Kleihauer‚ÄìBetke test can detect very small amounts of maternal blood before the third trimester of pregnancy by monitoring hemoglobin elution in acid because adult and fetal hemoglobin elute differently in acid. Finally, a white blood cell count can detect maternal blood in the sample, as fetal white blood cells are primarily leukocytes, while maternal white blood cells are mostly neutrophils. If amniotic fluid infiltrated the sample, then there would be a reduction in the volume of RBCs, white blood cells, and platelets in the sample. Also, patterns consistent with amniotic fluid would be visible in the sample. Associated risks The most common complication is a hemorrhage, or bleeding, of the puncture site and can be especially dangerous when the fetus is younger than 21 weeks. The risk of hemorrhage is greater if the fetus has a defect that affects its platelets. A transfusion of donor platelets is usually done in such cases to reduce the risk of bleeding. If the bleeding is severe, immediate delivery is an option as long as the fetus is old enough to survive, or fetal blood volume restoration may be considered. Another possible complication is cord hematoma, which doesn‚Äôt have any characteristic symptoms but can be indicated by sudden bradycardia. If the hematoma is under control, the fetus is monitored until stabilized. If the fetus remains unstable, a delivery may be done. Fetomaternal hemorrhage is another complication that occurs when the fetal blood mixes into the maternal blood. A small fetomaternal hemorrhage could cause an increase in maternal antigens, while a large fetomaternal hemorrhage could cause fetal anemia and death. Fetal bradycardia, low heart rate, is another complication that may occur. Most cases of fetal bradycardia are self-resolved within five minutes. The complication of infection has a low incidence rate, and preventative measures are implemented against the risk of infection, such as antibiotic usage and the aseptic technique. However, vertical transmission of a virus such as HIV may occur. Fetal loss may also occur, especially in the presence of several risk factors, including fetal abnormalities, operator errors, placental penetration, and viability of the fetus. Intrahepatic vein fetal blood sampling may be done as an alternative to PUBS. It involves the needle being inserted into the intrahepatic part of the umbilical cord in the fetal abdomen. The benefits of this alternative, compared to PUBS, are that chances of contamination of the fetal blood are very low, the risk of fetomaternal hemorrhage are reduced, the risk of bleeding from the sampling site is reduced, and access to the sampling site is easy regardless of the position of the placenta. In pregnancies with high risk of fetal thrombocytopenia, this is the preferred method of blood samples due to the very low risk of site bleeding. Indications and contraindications Human male karyotpe high resolution PUBS is not a diagnostic test that is indicated in every pregnancy. It is, however, suggested in pregnancy cases in which the blood gas levels and pH would aid in diagnosis of a condition, such as anemia, or delivery plan, if termination of the pregnancy is being considered or special plans must be made. Umbilical cord blood gas analysis may assist with clinical management and excludes the diagnosis of birth asphyxia in approximately 80% of depressed newborns at term. Severe fetal growth issues in conjunction with low oxygen in the fetus‚Äô blood and high levels in the mother‚Äôs blood also indicate the use of PUBS. With more detailed observations and information on fetal tissue perfusion and metabolism, better predictions on development can be made. For pregnancies in which genetic abnormalities may be present, PUBS can be used to construct a karyotype, usually within 48 hours, and detect irregular chromosomal patterns. Karyotypes are able to confirm or detect monosomies, trisomies, or missing portions of chromosomes to give a detailed picture of the severity of the genetic defect as well as predicting developmental future. PUBS is also indicated in the cases of twins with accumulation of amniotic fluid and substantially different growth rates (at least 10%), if the fetus is expected to be breaking down red blood cells improperly, and in the alleviation of hydrops fetalis, a build-up of fluid in at least 2 parts of the fetus. Suspicion of fetal infections, such as rubella and toxoplasmosis, as well as the need to supply medicine or blood transfusions to the fetus are indications for the use of PUBS. Due to its invasive nature, the contraindications of PUBS, reasons to not undergo the procedure, must be taken into account in order to ensure the safety of the fetus and the mother. During the first 18 weeks of pregnancy, the umbilical vein from which the blood sample is taken is not very stable, which could lead to excessive bleeding; therefore, PUBS is contraindicated in any fetus under the age of 18 weeks old. While blood gas levels and pH values are able to give parents and medical professionals a snapshot of fetal status, these fetuses can be monitored with less invasive procedures and equipment, such as ultrasounds, cardiotocography, or maternal blood tests. Mothers affected by hepatitis B are not advised to undergo PUBS. In these cases, the fetus would be put at an increased risk of contracting the hepatitis virus from the mother. However, the necessity of the procedure should be considered along with this risk. PUBS should not be performed in mothers testing positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) due to increased risk of fetal contraction. If PUBS is being used to determine if the fetus has been infected with HIV it may not be contraindicated. Fetuses with a single umbilical artery Single umbilical artery. Left: thin-walled vein Right: thick-walled single artery.The most prevalent defect in about 1% of fetuses' umbilical region is a single umbilical artery. When a single umbilical artery is found, more tests are run including a detailed ultrasound to detect any other developmental abnormalities that may be the result of the single artery, genetic deviation, or other causes. Fetal developmental abnormalities along with the concern of an abnormal karyotype indicate PUBS; however, fetuses with a single umbilical artery may present a higher risk. In these cases, a single umbilical artery is required to perform the work of two arteries so it is often dilated up to one and a half times its size in order to meet these demands. A documented case of puncturing a single umbilical artery during PUBS resulted in a decrease in the heart rate of the fetus with irregular improvement; however, it is difficult to conclude that these symptoms were solely the result of the punctured umbilical artery because these fetuses often have preexisting defects and abnormalities. While ultrasounds and color flow mapping can be used to avoid the umbilical artery and sample from the umbilical vein, the dilation makes the single umbilical artery easier to puncture. Blood flow in the umbilical artery is seen to be twice the normal amount from about 20 weeks on so the effects of a punctured umbilical artery during PUBS are more severe.

Each player takes the role of a Baron vying to claim the throne of an unnamed kingdom. Gameplay revolves around raising an army, obtaining enough money to maintain that army, and gaining influence through a variety of means. An expansion, Crown and Glory, was released by Fantasy Flight Games in 2007, adding scientific advancement and other optional rules to the game. Contents In the 2006 version of the game, Warrior Knights is played on a square board approximately 24\\" to a side. The majority of the board is used to represent the Kingdom, overlaid with a hexagonal grid. Additional insets are used for overseas cities, all of which are real places, notably including Jerusalem and Constantinople. Additional areas on the board are used to keep track of stacks of cards or counters. The game components include: * 380 die-cut cardboard counters representing crowns (money), faith, votes, influence, casualties, breaches, expeditions, sieges, and control. * a set of Action cards for each player, used to select what activities that player will perform each round, plus extra Neutral Action cards * 36 Event cards * 45 Agenda cards * 66 mercenary cards * 24 Fate cards, used to resolve any random outcome within the game. * a cardboard gavel, wielded by the player controlling the office of Chairman of the Assembly * a carboard sceptre, give to the player who becomes Head of the Church * 24 plastic counters used to mark cities * 24 plastic figurines representing Nobles (four per player), who lead the players' armies * a rulebook Gameplay The King of an unnamed kingdom has been murdered. Now the Barons of the realm (2‚Äì6 players) must vie for control of the empty throne. Each round of gameplay consists of at least three phases: Planning, Action, and Upkeep. In addition, the following special phases may be triggered during the Action phase, and may or may not happen in any given round: Taxation, Wages, Assembly, and the Mercenary Draft.  Planning  Each player selects up to six action cards from his action deck. These are divided into which two the player wishes to execute first, which two second, and which two last. All players' \\"first\\" choices are shuffled together, all \\"second\\" choices shuffled together, and all \\"last\\" choices shuffled together. Two cards from the Neutral Action deck are shuffled into each stack.  Action  Cards from the \\"first\\" action stack are revealed and resolved one at a time. A player's action card may allow the player to collect crowns, votes, or faith, Move or attack with an army, or claim a turn in the mercenary draft. Neutral actions typically affect all players and may result in an Event card being drawn or provide opportunities to replace casualties, repair or improve city defenses, or invest in an overseas expedition. After each card is executed, it is allocated to one of the card stacks on the lower right-hand corner of the board. When one of these stacks contains enough cards, one of the special phases is triggered.  Upkeep  During the Upkeep phase, any player who has control of more than half the cities in the Kingdom wins. If no player controls that many cities, each player receives one Influence counter for each city they control. These counters are taken from a pile set aside at the beginning of the game. When this pile is exhausted, the game ends and the player with the most influence is the winner.  Taxation  When a Taxation phase is triggered, all players gain a number Crowns determined by which cities they control.  Wages  When a Wages phase is triggered, all players must pay the troops they control. Unpaid mercenaries desert the player's army and are shuffled back into the mercenary deck.  Assembly  Three Agenda cards are drawn. These may adjust the rules of the game or give one player additional options. Players spend their Vote tokens to determine whether or not an agenda enters play, or to determine which player receives the card.  Mercenary Draft  The only way a player can increase the size of his army is by hiring mercenaries. A number of cards equal to one more than the number of players is drawn from the Mercenary deck. Players claim turns in the Mercenary Draft during the Action phase. When all the turns are claimed, the Mercenary draft occurs. Players who have claimed a turn have the option of hiring one of the available mercenary cards by paying the fee listed on the card. Victory conditions In the edition published by Games Workshop in 1987, the first player to conquer more that half of the undamaged cities in play wins the game. The 2006 edition of the game published by Fantasy Flight Games added an additional victory condition: If the pool of Influence counters is exhausted before one player has conquered more than half of the cities, the player with the most Influence at that point is declared the winner Reception In the August-September 1987 edition of Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer (No. 79), although Tom Swider found issues with some of the rules and cards in the original version by Games Workshop, he liked the game, saying, \\"The system is simple enough to attract players, and provides enough action to keep ones interest high, even if the fates have not been kind. I highly recommend the purchase of this game to gamers who like multi-player games such as Kingmaker or Borderlands.\\" Swider commented that On the German game review site Good Game Guide, the reviewers were impressed by the components of the 2006 edition of the game, but found the thick rulebook to be daunting, saying that an initial read-through of the rules \\"can easily take around 90 minutes.\\" They also advised that the game could take significantly longer than the 90 minutes advertised on the box, commenting, \\"You can easily expect one hour per player.\\" However, the reviewers thought this was time well spent, calling the game \\"complex and highly interesting.\\" The only element of the game that drew criticism was the combat system, which the reviewers found \\"unnecessarily complicated.\\" The reviewers concluded with a strong recommendation, saying, \\"You should definitely try the game, but bring some time and patience, because in fact the game has many great elements.\\" On the German game review site Fantasyguide, Marcus Krug admired the quality of the game components included with the Fantasy Flights edition, calling them \\"the most beautiful I have seen in a while.\\" He also liked the design of the rulebook, but thought that it \\"could be a bit more structured [...] Looking up [rules] is not easy.\\" He also found the game to be highly complex, saying, \\"The rules are not easy for beginners and in my experience are very daunting. This results in part from their complexity, but above all from the mass of possibilities that Warrior Knights offers.\\" He warned that it takes several games to learn the proper strategies. Krug also noted that the game length of 45 minutes on the box was \\"optimistic\\", noting that \\"three or four of us needed about 3 to 4 hours, with 5 and 6 players it was more like 5 hours.\\" He concluded that for the proper player, this was a great game: \\"If you are looking for a game of conquest, with beautiful battles and a good dose of politics, this is the place for you [...] Warrior Knights is certainly not an easy game, but it doesn't want to be and shouldn't be. This is about something epic that also needs to be experienced and not just played. In my opinion, absolutely recommendable, but only for people with the endurance for a long game.\\" On the Austrian game review site Spieletest, Bernard Tischler warned that \\"The complexity of Warrior Knights is appallingly high. [...] The game is therefore not for casual gamers, but requires at least three games with a committed, constant community of players, so that all the detailed rules can be internalized.\\" Tischler felt that a basic game should have been published first, followed by the release of extra expansions containing new variant rules; he felt this would have opened the game up to casual gamers.

Located in Century City, the hotel forms a sweeping crescent design fronting the Avenue of the Stars, adjacent to the twin Century Plaza Towers and the 2000 Avenue of the Stars complex. At the time of its opening in 1966, the Century Plaza Hotel was the highest building in Century City, with views extending all the way to the Pacific Ocean. It was also the first hotel to have color televisions in all of its rooms. The hotel closed for renovations in 2016, and will reopen in 2020 operated by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts.  History  In 1961, developer William Zeckendorf and Alcoa bought about from 20th Century Fox after the studio had suffered a string of expensive flops, culminating in the box-office disaster Cleopatra. The new owners conceived Century City as \\"a city within a city\\" with the arc-shaped, 19-story, 750-room Minoru Yamasaki-designed Century Plaza as the centerpiece of the new city. When the Century Plaza began operating in 1966, its doormen wore red Beefeater costumes. The hotel was managed by Western International Hotels, which later changed its name to Westin Hotels. The hotel's ballrooms became the center for numerous high-profile events, including an opening charity gala in 1966 emceed by Bob Hope, who with singer Andy Williams entertained Ronald and Nancy Reagan and Walt and Lillian Disney. In 1967, 1,300 club-swinging police clashed with about 10,000 Vietnam War demonstrators as President Johnson spoke at a Democratic fundraiser at the hotel. On August 13, 1969, President Richard Nixon hosted a lavish state dinner in the Los Angeles Ballroom to celebrate the Apollo 11 moon landing astronauts. In 1984, the hotel added a 322-room tower on the south portion of the property, adjacent to Olympic Boulevard. The Tower at Century Plaza was marketed as a luxury wing of the hotel and increased capacity to 1,072 rooms. Ronald Reagan by arrangement signed in as the first guest of the just completed Tower, while then Century Plaza Vice- President and Managing Director William Quinn greeted him on December 27, 1984. In 1999 the hotel rededicated its penthouse suite, the entire 32nd floor the Ronald Reagan Suite, attendees including Nancy Reagan. While Reagan was in office, he stayed in the Tower so frequently the media dubbed it his Western White House. President Reagan had recently celebrated his re-election to a second term as President on the stage of the Los Angeles Ballroom in the original Century Plaza Hotel on November 6, 1984. In 2000, soon after Westin was acquired by Starwood, the Tower was converted into a separate hotel under a more luxurious Starwood brand, The St. Regis Los Angeles. That hotel was then sold by the owners of the Century Plaza in 2005 to developers who closed it for conversion to residential use. With its 1980s ceilings too low to meet modern residential demands, the relatively new building was razed to make way for The Century, a high-rise condominium completed in fall 2009. In 2006, after being managed for its entire forty-year history by Westin Hotels, the property was taken over by Hyatt Hotels and renamed Hyatt Regency Century Plaza. However, the sign above the main entrance reading The Century Plaza was left unchanged. Sunstone Hotel Investors Inc. bought the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza in 2005 for $293 million and then spent $22 million upgrading the guest rooms and common areas. On June 1, 2008, Sunstone sold the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza to Next Century Associates for $366.5 million. The sale price of $505,000 per room was one of the highest-paid for a hotel in California. On December 18, 2008, the new owners announced plans to demolish the hotel and build a pair of fifty-story towers in its place. On April 28, 2009, The Century Plaza Hotel was added to The National Trust for Historic Preservation's list of the 11 most endangered historic places in America. In February 2010, the developer announced that it would renovate the historic hotel building and convert some of the floors to condominiums, rather than demolishing and replacing the building as previously proposed. Renovation and twin tower additions The hotel closed on March 1, 2016 to begin the $2.5 billion overhaul. It ceased to be operated by Hyatt at this time. The two towers named Century Plaza North Tower and Century Plaza South Tower; that were to replace the hotel will now be built behind it. Designed by Pei Cobb Freed, Gensler, and Marmol Radziner, they will contain a total of 268 condominiums. The original 726-room hotel tower will be rebuilt with 400 much larger guest rooms and 63 condominiums. The hotel's lobby will be opened to create a public space. The hotel will reopenhttp://www.fairmont.com/destinations/development/ in 2020 as Fairmont Century Plaza, managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts. Notable people and events The Century Plaza has played host to various celebrities, foreign dignitaries, and presidents; among them, Marshal Josip Broz Tito, Moshe Dayan, Lyndon Johnson, Ronald Reagan, Prince Philip, and David Ben-Gurion. The hotel was the venue for the 1967 Emmy Awards, and the 1970 and 1971 Grammy Awards. It was also the venue for the 2009 and 2010 Visual Effects Society's prestigious annual awards ceremony. In popular culture The Century Plaza Hotel is featured in the 2008 video game, Midnight Club: Los Angeles, and is mimicked in the 2004 video game, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.

Early life and musical education Born in Washington, Fuller initially studied piano with his mother, Georgette Fuller. After studying piano and musicology at Central Washington University, he went on to receive a master's degree in music from the University of Oregon in 1971. Subsequently, he studied harpsichord and fortepiano in San Francisco, New York and Vienna. Life and career Since relocating to Vienna, Austria, over three decades ago, Fuller has emerged as an interpreter of the fortepiano repertoire. He has performed in Vienna's Konzerthaus, Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna, Amsterdam's Concertgebouw, London's Wigmore Hall and many other major venues and festivals in Europe, the United States, Japan and Central America. Fuller is one of the few who has sought to address himself exclusively to the interpretive potential of the fortepiano, its subtle sensitivity and delicacy evoking an earlier - in many respects lost - keyboard culture. Born in the U.S. state of Washington, Fuller studied initially with his mother, later taking degrees in piano and musicology at Central Washington University and the University of Oregon, He studied harpsichord and fortepiano in San Francisco and Vienna. The emphasis of his artistic work lies in the interpretation of the piano, chamber music and the Lied repertoire of the Viennese Classical and early Romantic periods, performed on the fortepiano. His concert work has led him to the musical centers of North America and Europe where he appears as soloist, accompanist and member of numerous chamber music ensembles devoted primarily to the performance of 18th-century music on authentic instruments. In addition he has collaborated with artists James Levine (with the Vienna Philharmonic), Emma Kirkby, Maria Kubizek, Andrew Manze, Klaus Mertens,], Dorothea R√∂schman, Claus Ocker, Wolfgang Holzmair, the Festetics String Quartet (Budapest), Vienna Academy Orchestra, Musica Aeterna Bratislava, and Capella Musicae Graz; live concerts in radio and television, film music, broadcast productions for German Radio (Deutschlandfunk, Cologne), North German Radio (Norddeutscher Rundfunk, Hamburg), Austrian National Radio, BBC and the Hungarian National Radio as well as numerous CD recordings in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Slovakia. Fuller's discography also includes noted premiere recordings of the piano quartets of Johann Baptist Wanhal with Musica Aeterna Bratislava, the solo piano works of Ignaz Pleyel (1757‚Äì1831) and the cycle of 12 piano sonatas of Hyacinthe Jadin (1776‚Äì1800). In 2002, Fuller received from the University of Oregon Distinguished Alumnus Award for his artistic work. In 2006 Fuller initiated and directed the Donaust√§dter Mozart Projekt, an ongoing series of performances dedicated to the piano music, chamber music and vocal music of Mozart's Vienna years (1781‚Äì1791). Other recent projects include recordings of Haydn's piano music on one of Haydn's few known pianos as well as a comprehensive project in 2008 and 2009 in connection with the Haydn Year 2009 of his piano music, vocal music and chamber music.

It is located on the Morecambe Branch Line from Lancaster to Heysham Port and was opened by the London and North Western Railway in 1864. A level crossing with the public highway known as Bare Lane exists immediately to the west of the station, which until recently was controlled by the adjacent Bare Lane signal box, a fringe cabin to the Preston PSB Area. This box was closed on 8 December 2012, when the signalling equipment was renewed by Network Rail and control of the crossing switched to CCTV and transferred to Preston power box. The old station building on the platform is now a private dwelling. It was auctioned to the public, and was featured on the BBC programme Homes Under the Hammer, a show about buildings which are auctioned to the public and redeveloped. The station in 1962 Layout Although the station has two side platforms, the track layout through it is not the conventional double track used on most main & secondary routes, but two independent bi-directional single lines. Platform 1 serves the Up & Down Morecambe line (which is in effect a long siding all the way to the terminus), whilst platform 2 handles trains on what is now the Up & Down Heysham line. The latter is connected to the now-single track branch down to at Holt Bank Junction (just outside Morecambe station), with the junction points operated from a ground frame worked by the train crew. The two lines converge east of the station, but then immediately split into the single line curves toward and towards Lancaster; the former sees only limited use, whereas the latter was double track until 1988 and is used by the vast majority of trains on the route. This layout dates from the closure of the former terminus at and its associated signal box in February 1994, with Bare Lane signal box taking over control of all signalling on the line thereafter (other than that controlling the junctions with the main line at Hest Bank). As mentioned above however, it was closed in December 2012. The structure remained intact for another year and had been used for several months by Northern staff as a manned help point for travellers due to the absence of digital passenger information screens at the station. It was eventually demolished in January 2014 after the PIS screens were installed and finally brought into use. The station is unstaffed and had no ticket facilities of any kind until recently - Northern has now installed one as part of a programme of station improvements in the area. Waiting shelters are provided and both platforms have step-free access. Services The station is served by Northern Trains local services, which operate as a regular (hourly with some peak extras) Lancaster-Morecambe shuttle.GB National Rail Timetable May 2019, Table 98 One return service throughout the week is extended to and from to meet the daily ferry to the Isle of Man. There are also a few longer-distance services (currently five per day Mon-Sat and on Sundays also since December 2019) from Morecambe to Skipton and Leeds via the Leeds to Morecambe Line. In addition, for many years the last train each weekday evening was a First TransPennine Express service from Windermere, which diverted from its route to Barrow-in-Furness. This service called at Lancaster, Bare Lane and Morecambe, before reversing, calling at Bare Lane again, then rejoining the West Coast Main Line and continuing via Carnforth thus avoiding the 1m 7ch section of the WCML between Hest Bank South Junction and Hest Bank North Junction. This was the only scheduled service to use the original 1864 curve towards Hest Bank and as such functioned as a Parliamentary train to avoid the need for formal closure proceedings for this short stretch of line. In the present (May 2019) timetable, just one early a.m Lancaster to Morecambe via Carnforth train takes this route to meet the TOC's franchise obligations.

The Heck's name was a combination of the names Haddad, Ellis and Cook. Haddad served as President, Lester Ellis was Vice-President, and Tom Ellis was Secretary- Treasurer. History Heck's, Inc. was established in 1959 by Fred Haddad, Tom & Lester Ellis, and Doug Cook. The main office was located at 1012 Kanawha Blvd., Charleston, WV. Heck's stores were discount, stand alone department stores found in small cities throughout West Virginia, Virginia, western Maryland, the Ohio Valley, as well as parts of Indiana, Kentucky, and North Carolina. Its structure and product lines were similar to its competitors, Fisher's Big Wheel, Hills Department Stores, G.C. Murphy's Mart, Tempo and Buckeye Mart Stores and Walmart. Part of Heck's expansion into the Midwest came after acquiring a smaller discounter, T-Way Stores (Tradeway) of Indianapolis, Indianahttps://inspectbiz.com/c/in/75670/tradeway-of-indiana- inc. It also acquired Mr. Wiggs of Indiana and Ohio in 1981.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat;=19811125&id;=ZH1SAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=qAIEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5261,3595599 At its peak in the 1980s, Heck's operated 170 stores throughout West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina. Forbes Magazine ranked Heck‚Äôs third nationally in profitability and growth in 1980, beating out Kmart. In 1983, Haddad retired as Heck's president and sold his stock in the company. The Ellis brothers had previously sold out in the 1970s. Sales fell the following year, and the company saw its first losses in 1984. In 1985, layoffs began, as losses continued. A number of factors contributed to Heck‚Äôs decline. The U.S. economic downturn of the early 1980s hit West Virginia particularly hard, and the store faced increased competition from other chains as well. In February 1987 a $125 million merger agreement with New York City-Based Toussie-Viner Group was terminated due to weak performance by Heck's in the final months of 1986, and the company filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. At the time of the filing, Heck's operated 140 stores.http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3092/is_n15_v28/ai_7838463/?tag=content;col1 In 1989 the company emerged from Chapter 11 with 55 stores and under a new name, as Take 10 Discount Club; a membership club costing $10 to join.http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3092/is_n19_v28/ai_8089653/?tag=content;col1 In September 2019 all of the assets of the Retail Division were sold to Retail Acquisition Corporation, Inc., and became L.A.

He made his art by weaving found vegetation, such as grasses, into extraordinary garments. He also used sheep's wool picked from barbed wire fences, and leaves. MacPhee created most of his work whilst in the Craig Dunain Hospital near Inverness. He chose not to speak for 50 years.  Biography  MacPhee was born into a crofting family from Eochar/Iochdar, South Uist (Outer Hebrides), although he was actually born in Nettlehole, west of Glasgow, whilst his father worked as a hired hand before returning to Uist to settle when Angus was 7. As a young boy on the croft, he learnt how to make ropes and horse-harness from the abundant marram grass or muirineach on the island. He showed some skills playing music and singing, loved horses,Timothy Neat; Voice of the Bard. pub.Canongate, 1999. but otherwise appeared to be a normal child of a poor crofting family. Although as a young child he was brought up in a Scots English-speaking community, on the island he soon became a fluent speaker of Gaelic. MacPhee served with the Lovat Scouts, and rode on horseback to join them at Beaufort Castle, where the horse was sold for ¬£70.Timothy Neat; Voice of the Bard. pub.Canongate, 1999. Angus was garrisoned in the Faroe Islands during World War II, where he became increasingly mentally ill. No one knew what caused this illness. He returned home on the croft, but he became mute, sullen and self-absorbed. His family noticed his animals became neglected, and soon he was moved to Larbert Asylum. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1946, and spent much of the rest of his life in Craig Dunain Hospital.Roger Hutchinson; The Silent Weaver. pub.Birlinn, 2011. He fell largely silent and according to Joyce Laing, an art therapist who came across MacPhee in the 1970s, he didn't speak for more than 50 years.Joyce Laing: Weaver of Grass.pub. Taigh Chearsabhagh Trust 2000. There is some uncertainty about how totally mute MacPhee actually was, and the first full biography of MacPhee, by Roger HutchinsonRoger Hutchinson; The Silent Weaver. pub.Birlinn, 2011. shows there was evidence that MacPhee spoke a little to a few close friends in Craig Dunain, in Gaelic. Whatever, the fact seems to be that he remained largely silent for 50 years. Described as 'the quiet big man', he was admitted to the farm ward of the hospital, Kinmylies House. There he tended the animals and worked on the lands. He was a steady and hard worker and had a particular affection for horses. During his free time, MacPhee wandered the hospital grounds in search of materials and created objects woven mostly from grass, sheep wool and beech leaves. He made garments, hats, caps, pouches, harnesses and the like, which he liked to hide under the bushes. He was completely silent as to their purpose.Joyce Laing: Weaver of Grass.pub. Taigh Chearsabhagh Trust 2000. In the 1990s, as part of the movement to return psychiatric patients to the community, Angus was moved back to South Uist, and lived until his death in the Old People's Nursing Home in DaliburghTimothy Neat; Voice of the Bard. pub.Canongate, 1999. within an hours' drive of his remaining family. Joyce Laing recalls visiting him and showing him a photograph of a favourite horse. To her surprise Angus briefly spoke, commenting on the horse. She hoped that he might eventually reveal his story to her but within a short time he died.Joyce Laing: Weaver of Grass.pub. Taigh Chearsabhagh Trust 2000.  Work and influence  The ruined crofthouse at Iochdar, South Uist, where Angus McPhee was brought up In 1977 he was found as an inmate of Craig Dunain by Joyce Laing, an art therapist. Under the influence of Jean Dubuffet and others, she was searching, with the playwright Tom McGrath, for 'Art Brut' artists. Laing was able to rescue a number of pieces of work by MacPhee which are now in the collection of the Pittenweem 'Art Extraordinary Gallery'. She wrote the book Angus McPhee: Weaver of Grass for an April 2000 exhibition for the Taigh Chearsabhagh Art Trust in Lochmaddy, and she continued to visit MacPhee until his death. In Roger Hutchinson's 'The Silent Weaver' he develops a case for seeing MacPhee's weaving as a way of Angus finding his way back to a kind of health or mental equilibrium by creatively using traditional craft skills and developing them into a unique form of expression.Roger Hutchinson; The Silent Weaver. pub.Birlinn, 2011. Close up of a woven grass tunic made by Angus McPhee at Craig Dunain Hospital In 1997 the Mackenzie Sisters included a self-written song 'A'fighe le feur' (Weaver of Grass) on their first album Camhanach, inspired by the unusual story of Angus MacPhee. Sung in Gaelic the English translation of the opening is \\"Have you ever heard a stranger sound than Angus MacPhee knitting with grass?\\".Mackenzie: Camhanach. 1997 Macmeanmna. In 2004 Donnie Munro (ex-Runrig) included his song 'Weaver of Grass' inspired by the story of Angus MacPhee in his album 'Fields of the Young'. In 2004, a documentary was made of his life by Nick Higgins: Hidden Gifts: The Mystery of Angus MacPhee (IMDB), which won the 2005 Britspotting award. This includes some home-movie footage of Angus back in Uist, towards the end of his life. In 2011 a new book entitled The Silent Weaver by Roger Hutchinson was published, the fullest and best researched account yet of MacPhee's life and his place as an artist. His story has also been developed as a theatre production, called 'Angus ‚Äì Weaver of Grass', by Horse and Bamboo Theatre which has toured extensively in the Highlands and Islands during the summers of 2012 and 2013, also appearing in London, Oxford and Lancashire. The Caithness fibre artist, Joanne B Kaar, has worked alongside Horse + Bamboo Theatre on their production, and directly with Joyce Laing. In the process she has rediscovered the techniques used by Angus MacPhee and has recreated some of his garments both for the theatre production, for the collection in Pittenweem, and for Scottish Museums. In 2011/2012 artist Mike Inglis incorporated textures and outfits directly influenced by the stories and artefacts of Angus into his 65-metre permanent Public Art wall installation in Inverness. He is currently developing a new body of work entitled \\"Chasing the Ghost of Angus McPhee\\" supported by Creative Scotland and University of Edinburgh research grants which further develops themes surrounding Scottish identity and culture as well as his obsession with Angus and it will be shown in 2014.

A fossilized example scarabaeoid was found embedded in the amber resin of Hymenaea protera in the Dominican Republic. The species was described by Brett C. Ratcliffe and Federico Carlos Ocampo in 2001.  Holotype  The observed specimen is assumed to be female based on similarities to the female specimens of the genus Apalonychus. She was trapped in the resin produced by Hymenaea protera, now also extinct. The amber was previously dated to Oligocene or Eocene, but these datings are since considered incorrect, and it is accepted that the amber was formed between late Early Miocene and Middle Miocene (15‚Äì20 million years ago). The amber came from Dominican Republic, probably from the mountain range north of Santiago de los Caballeros. It is too dark for ventral characteristics of the insect's body to be observed.  Description  Unlike other hybosorids from the West Indies, whose antennae are 10-segmented, Tyrannasorus rex had nine-segmented antennae. The species is most similar to the genera Coilodes and Apalonychus; their shared characteristics include convex and not quite spherical body and reddish-brown colour. The most prominent difference between Coilodes and Tyrannasorus is in the shape of antennal club, which is slightly concave in Tyrannasorus but cup-shaped in Coilodes. Furthermore, the former's labrum is wider than the latter's and, unlike the former's, the anterior margin of the latter's pronotum is sinuate. Species of the genus Apalonychus have a much more elongated club of the antenna compared to Tyrannasorus and, unlike Tyrannasorus, eyes of the specimen are subglose and easily visible in dorsal view. Their labrum is also wider than that of Tyrannasorus and the anterior margin of their pronotum is not sinuate. As with other insects, the beetle's six legs consisted of a pair of prolegs, a pair of middle legs and a pair of posterior legs. The insect's elytra have a smooth surface.  Etymology  It was named after Tyrannosaurus rex, the dinosaur, although its discoverers provide an etymology for the name based on the word Hybosorus, the genus that formed the basis for the subfamily, known as Hybosoridae, to which the species belongs. The stem of the generic name is derived from the Latin tyrannus, meaning \\"master\\" or \\"tyrannical\\", while the suffix -sorus means \\"pile\\" or \\"hump\\" in Latin. The name, \\"tyrannical hump\\", ultimately refers to the mound of sap in which the observed specimen was fatally trapped.

The population of Morecambe and Heysham is 55,428, with Morecambe itself forming the majority at 42,589. Name of Morecambe The first use of the name was by John Whitaker in his History of Manchester (1771), when he refers to the \\"√¶stury of Moricambe\\". It next appears four years later in Antiquities of Furness, where the bay is described as \\"the Bay of Morecambe\\". That name is derived from the Roman name Moriancabris √Üsturis shown on maps prepared for them by Claudius Ptolem≈ìus (Ptolemy) from his original Greek maps. At this distance in time it is impossible to say if the name was originally derived from an earlier language (e.g. Celtic language) or from Greek. The Latin version describes the fourth inlet north from Wales on the west coast of England as Moriancabris √Üsturis. Translated, this gives a more accurate description than the present name of Morecambe Bay as the Latin refers to multiple estuaries on a curved sea, not a bay, as then the word sinus or gulf would have been used. The name appeared in March 1862 on a steam locomotive built for the South Durham and Lancashire Union Railway, which could indicate it was already in unofficial use for the area. It was not until 1889 that the necessary legislation was passed to officially name the area Morecambe, comprising the hamlets of Poulton, Bare and Torrisholme (a township for the purposes of the Census of 1841 but shown as separate townships in the previous Census of 1831). In 1894, the Urban District Council was formed, thus freeing Morecambe completely from its governance by the Borough of Lancaster until 1974 when Lancaster again took charge. Before the creation of Morecambe, Poulton acquired two suffixes, \\"le Sands\\" and briefly \\"on Sands\\". The reason for these additions stems from the dearth of names of townships in earlier times with the same name recurring over again. In the days before free movement of people, this was not so important. As travel became easier through first the turnpikes and later the railways, it became necessary to differentiate between the various towns with the same name, hence the additions. On 3 August 1928, the name changed again when the Corporation of Morecambe amalgamated with Heysham Urban District Council to form the Municipal Borough of Morecambe and Heysham. History In 1846, the Morecambe Harbour and Railway Company was formedAwdry, C. (1990), Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies, Patrick Stephens Ltd, Wellingborough, . to build a harbour on Morecambe Bay, close to the fishing village of Poulton-le-Sands and a connecting railway. By 1850, the railway linked to Skipton, Keighley and Bradford in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and a settlement began to grow around the harbour and railway to service the port and as a seaside resort. The settlement expanded to absorb Poulton and the villages of Bare and Torrisholme. The settlement started to be referred to as \\"Morecambe\\", possibly after the harbour and railway. In 1889, the new name was officially adopted. Morecambe was a thriving seaside resort in the mid-20th century. While the resort of Blackpool attracted holiday-makers predominantly from the Lancashire mill towns, Morecambe had more visitors from Yorkshire (due to its railway connection) and Scotland. Mill workers from Bradford and further afield in West Yorkshire would holiday at Morecambe, with some retiring there. This gave Morecambe the nickname \\"Bradford on Sea\\". Between 1956 and 1989, it was the home of the Miss Great Britain beauty contest. Morecambe suffered a decades- long decline after a series of incidents that damaged tourism and the local economy.Alan Cowell, Postcard From Ailing British Coasts: Wish You Were Here, The New York Times, 12 April 2007. Two piers were lost: West End Pier was partly washed away in a storm in November 1977, and the remnants were demolished in 1978; Central Pier, damaged by fire in 1933, was removed in 1992. In 1994, The World of Crinkley Bottom attraction in Happy Mount Park closed only thirteen weeks after opening. The ensuing Blobbygate scandal led to a legal battle between Lancaster City Council and TV star Noel Edmonds. The closures of Bubbles, Morecambe's swimming pool, and the Frontierland fairground soon followed. Concern over the decline of Morecambe's West End led to regeneration and investment in the area. The Times and The Daily Telegraph ran features on Morecambe's revival around Easter 2006. After falling into abeyance in the mid-1980s, the Miss Morecambe beauty contest was revived in 2006 by Margee Ltd, a local fashion store founded in 1933 ‚Äì the same year that the second Midland Hotel opened. Morecambe was selected by the RNLI as the location for its first active life-saving hovercraft. (Griffon 470SAR) H-002 \\"The Hurley Flyer\\", which became operational on 23 December 2002, was housed in a temporary garage next to the Yacht Club until a permanent building could be designed and built.

On 5 February 2004, there was a major loss of life in Morecambe Bay when Chinese immigrant shellfish harvesters were drowned. In December 2017 a local general practitioner and community health activist claimed that children in Morecambe were suffering from malnourishment and implied that cases of rickets had been observed as a consequence. The Morecambe Bay Clinical Commissioning Group subsequently sought to correct the GP's claims and clarified the aetiology of vitamin D deficiency in the local population, explaining \\"rickets is a very rare condition and has multiple causes\\". The \\"Morecambe Budget\\" Morecambe Beach looking towards the West End Enoch Powell made a speech in Morecambe on 11 October 1968 on the economy, setting out alternative, radical free-market policies that would later be called the Morecambe Budget. Powell used the financial year 1968‚Äì69 to show how income tax could be halved from 8s 3d to 4s 3d in the pound (basic rate cut from 41% to 21%)Roy Lewis, Enoch Powell: Principle in Politics (Cassell, 1979), p. 69. and how capital gains tax and Selective Employment Tax could be abolished without reducing expenditure on defence or the social services. These tax cuts required a saving of ¬£2,855 million, and this would be funded by eradicating losses in the nationalised industries and denationalising the profit-making state concerns; ending all housing subsidies except for those who could not afford their own housing; ending all foreign aid; ending all grants and subsidies in agriculture; ending all assistance to development areas; ending all investment grants;Robert Shepherd, Enoch Powell.

Morecambe and Alan Bennett The Yorkshire playwright and author Alan Bennett has enjoyed a long association with Morecambe and has often referred to the town in his work and writing. One of his early TV plays, Sunset Across the Bay (1975), is about a couple from Leeds who retire to Morecambe, leaving their old home with the words \\"Bye bye, mucky Leeds!\\" He based the play on memories of the many holidays he spent in Morecambe with his parents. In his essay \\"Written on the Body\\", collected in Untold Stories (2005), he even suggests that his association with the town is pre-natal: \\"[I]t had been in a boarding house that I was conceived, sometime over the August Bank Holiday of 1933 at Morecambe or Filey.\\" In the same collection, Bennett pays tribute to the Morecambe-born actress Thora Hird in the essays Last of the Sun, about the final play he wrote for her, and \\"Thora Hird 1911‚Äì2003\\", a memoir of the work they had done together since the 1960s. Earlier in the book, he discusses his maternal aunt Kathleen, who married in Morecambe and lived there until her death in 1974. Art Morecambe was the birthplace of the artist William Woodhouse (1857‚Äì1939), who lived all his life in the town and is buried with his wife and daughter at St. Peter's Church in the village of Heysham, a little to the south of Morecambe.

Landmarks Eric Morecambe statue One of Morecambe's most famous landmarks is a statue commemorating one of its most famous sons, Eric Morecambe. It was created by sculptor Graham Ibbeson. One of Morecambe's landmark buildings is the partially renovated Victoria Pavilion or Morecambe Winter Gardens. This was once a venue for swimming baths, a grand theatre, a restaurant and a ballroom. Morecambe's current library opened in 1967; it was designed by the office of the architect Roger Booth. It replaced the Victoria Street library, which opened in 1928. There had been earlier proposals to build a library in Morecambe with Carnegie funding, but arguments about the rates involved stalled the project. The library is mentioned by Pevsner and is one of the few noteworthy buildings, other than churches, that are not connected to the seaside trade. The building is formed by hexagons, with a hyperbolic parabolic roof, creating a distinctive skyline and interior. Morecambe once boasted two fairgrounds: a small one to the north of the railway station, which closed down in the 1980s, and a larger one to the south of the station, which ultimately became Frontierland and closed in 1999. The last remaining landmark on the site was the Polo Tower, left standing only because of the contract for the phone mast on top. This was demolished mid 2017. The future of the remaining land remains uncertain, although a shopping complex is heavily rumored. In July 2008, the local council ordered a clean-up of the Polo Tower, and scaffolding was erected around the structure to carry out a survey. It was demolished in sections, in July 2017. Near the promenade is the Morecambe and Heysham War Memorial which commemorates the men of Morecambe who lost their lives in the two world wars and the Korean War.Morecambe and Heysham War Memorial. United Kingdom National Inventory of War Memorials. UKNIWM Ref: 3332. Retrieved 16 August 2012. The memorial differs from most as it lists the First World War as 1914 to 1919 rather than 1914 to 1918. In March 2019 a Time and Tide Bell designed by Marcus Vergette was installed beside the Stone Jetty, as part of a national public art project. Midland Hotel Midland Hotel in 2008 after restoration The Midland Hotel is an art deco hotel on the seafront. It contains interior design and art pieces by artist Eric Gill.

At the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season the team moved from its Christie Park ground to a brand new home, the Globe Arena. The old ground was demolished to make way for a Sainsbury's supermarket. Fishing Morecambe Bay has some of the most varied fishing in all of Britain and is perhaps most famous for Morecambe Bay Potted Shrimps, which are 'By appointment to Her Majesty the Queen'. Rugby league When the rugby football schism occurred in 1895, Morecambe joined the Northern Rugby Football Union (now Rugby Football League) in its second season. Morecambe played for eight of the ten seasons from the 1896‚Äì97 season through to the end of 1905‚Äì06 season. Morecambe finished 14th of 14 in its first three seasons of the Lancashire Senior Competition, withdrew for the 1899‚Äì1900 and 1900‚Äì01 seasons, finished 11th of 13 in the Lancashire Senior Competition, then finished 17th of 18, 16th of 17, 13th of 14 in Division-2, and finally 30th of 31 in the recombined league, after which Morecambe withdrew from the Northern Rugby Football Union. The town still hosts a rugby league team, with Heysham Atoms playing from their Trimpell Sports and Social Club base.

Population The 2001 UK Census recorded 158,434 people born in the United States. According to the 2011 UK Census, there were 173,470 US-born residents in England, 3,715 in Wales, 15,919 in Scotland and 4,251 in Northern Ireland. The Office for National Statistics estimates that 197,000 US-born immigrants were resident in the UK in 2013. Figure given is the central estimate. See the source for 95 per cent confidence intervals. The largest single local cluster of Americans in Britain recorded by the 2001 Census was in Mildenhall in North-West Suffolk ‚Äì the site of RAF Mildenhall and nearby RAF Lakenheath. This is because of the legacy of the Cold War and NATO cooperation. 17.28 percent of Mildenhall's population were born in the US. In London, the majority of Americans are businesspeople and their families which ties in with the strong economic relations between London and New York City or Washington, D.C. Chelsea (where 6.53 percent of residents were born in the US in 2001) and Kensington (5.81 percent), have large American populations. Prior to the end of the Cold War, the highest proportion of Americans resident in the United Kingdom per head of population was centred on the Scottish seaside town of Dunoon, Argyll and Bute, the former site of the Holy Loch US Navy base. At its height in the early 1990s around a quarter of Dunoon's population was American. Some Americans in the UK are older, ex-servicemen who returned to Britain after being based in the UK during World War II.  Notable people = African Americans  African American immigration to the UK began as early as the late 18th century after American slaves failed in their attempt to defend the British Crown in the American Revolution. The Revolution began in the thirteen American colonies and United States in the late 1770s. The British promised freedom to any slave or rebel who fought the Americans on their behalf. African Americans made up over 20 percent of the American population at the time, which was the second largest ethnic group in British North America only after the English and as many as 30,000 slaves escaped to British lines. The largest regiment was the Black Pioneers who followed troops under Sir General Henry Clinton. Working as soldiers, labourers, pilots, cooks, and musicians, they were a major part of the unsuccessful British war effort. African Americans who fought against the British were known as Black Patriots (modern day African Americans in the US), but rather if they were fighting for the Crown or American Independence both were mostly doing it in return for promises of freedom from enslavement or indentured servitude. The British-American Commission identified the Black people who had joined the British before the surrender, and issued \\"certificates of freedom\\" signed by General Birch or General Musgrave. Those who chose to emigrate were evacuated by ship. The fallout of the Revolution resulted in an estimated 75,000 to 100,000 Black Americans scattering across the Atlantic world, profoundly affecting the development of Nova Scotia, the Bahamas, Jamaica, and the African nation of Sierra Leone as prominent leaders in the emerging freed black communities. To make sure no one attempted to leave who did not have a certificate of freedom, the name of any Black person on board a vessel, whether slave, indentured servant, or free, was recorded, along with the details of enslavement, escape, and military service, in a document called the Book of Negroes. Between 400 and 1,000 African Americans emigrated to London and were later given the title of Black Loyalist for their service in the British Armed forces and formed the core of the early Black British community. Musician Jimi Hendrix, an African American of Native American heritage, started to get his big break in London as part of his band The Jimi Hendrix Experience.

Her remains shared the same grave as Long Wolf's remains. Long Wolf and White Star Ghost Dog's coffin were repatriated to the Pine Ridge Reservation in 1997. Two years later, Paul Eagle Star's coffin was repatriated to the Rosebud Indian Reservation. Tribal descendants include John Black Feather (Long Wolf's great grandson), Moses Eagle Star and Lucy Eagle Star (Paul Eagle Star's two grandchildren). Blackfoot Sioux chief Charging Thunder came to Salford at age twenty-six as part of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show in 1903. Like many Lakota tribesmen, Charging Thunder was an exceptional horseman and performed thrilling stunts in Buffalo Bill's show in front of huge crowds, on the site of what is now Lowry in Salford Quays. But when the show rolled out of town, he remained in the North West. He married Josephine, an American horse trainer who had just given birth to their first child, Bessie and together they settled in Darwen, before moving to Gorton. His name became George Edward Williams, after registering with the British immigration authorities to enable him to find work. Williams ended up as an elephant keeper at the Belle Vue Zoo. He died on 28 July 1929 from pneumonia at age fifty-two. His interment was in Gorton's cemetery.

Between the 16th and 19th centuries Ruzhany, then called R√≥≈ºany, was the main seat of the senior line of the Sapieha noble family, known as the '. The castle is currently under systematic reconstruction, with the palace ornate gate and entry building being already restored.  History  Ruzhany began its life in the late 16th century as the site of Lew Sapieha's castle, the palace being completed in 1602. The Sapieha residence was destroyed in the course of the internecine strife in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania when it was attacked by Micha≈Ç Serwacy Wi≈õniowiecki's forces in 1700. Ruzhany Palace was rebuilt as a grand Neoclassical residence in the 1770s by Aleksander Micha≈Ç Sapieha, employing the services of the architect Jan Samuel Becker of Saxony, who set the palace in an English park landscape. Aside from the palace, there was a theatre (1784‚Äì88), an orangery and several other outbuildings. Becker also designed the local church (rebuilt in the 1850s). The castle gate was recently reconstructed. By the time of King Stanis≈Çaw II's visit in 1784, work on the palace had been suspended. The Sapieha estates were nationalised in the aftermath of the November Uprising (1831). Three years later, the palace compound was sold to be used as a textile mill and weaving factory. In 1914 the palace was accidentally set on fire by factory workers. The First World War and subsequent financial hardships prevented the building's restoration until 1930, however the partially restored palace became a ruin again within fifteen years, a casualty of the Second World War. The ornate palace gate survives and has recently been restored.

Publication history The book was written primarily in response to the 1995 death of Amis's father, the famed author Kingsley Amis, and was first published in 2000. Serialization Upon publication, Experience was serialized in the UK's The Guardian in four parts. Reception Critical response to Amis's memoir was very warm. The critic James Wood wrote in the Guardian, \\"Experience is a beautiful, and beautifully strange book, and it is unlike anything one expected. One feared a trough of plaint: either a sad, Gosse-like reckoning with the father; or an angry, journalistic reckoning with those journalists who have hunted Amis from tooth to tooth. But Experience is not quite a memoir, nor is it quite a portrait of his father, nor is it really an autobiography. It is an escape from memoir; indeed, an escape into privacy. In the very book which might, at first glance, seem most exhibitionist, most shamelessly metropolitan, Amis has softly retreated to the provinces of himself. His book often reads like a letter to his family and closest friends. It is sometimes embarrassing to read; the ordinary reader feels voyeuristic, at times almost uninvited, but very moved. What seems at first just gossip and guestlists - sprays of names offered without explanation, diaristic footnotes, a refusal to universalise - soon becomes a kind of tender defiance, as if Amis wanted the book to vibrate with an atmosphere of wounded privacy.\\" Terence Baker, in The Sunday Times, called it a \\"careful, heartfelt tribute.\\" Jackie Wullschlager, wrote in the Financial Times, \\"The core here is family, and it is movingly, beautifully, evoked... The raw materials ‚Äì neurotic, outrageous genius of a father; gorgeous earth-mother Hilly; sophisticated step-mother Elizabeth Jane Howard; stunning girlfriends dropped along the way like a shattering string of pearls; an unknown daughter emerging at 18 ‚Äì are unbeatable, and Amis makes of them a loving, perceptive, comic portrait.\\" Awards Experience was awarded the 2000 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for biography.

In broad terms, they can be grouped into following two categories: Academic titles Common titles and job descriptions within Universities and research organizations might be as follows: * Research Coordinator * Professor in Architectural History * Senior Lecturer in Architectural History * Lecturer in Architectural History * Researcher in Architectural History * Research Associate in Architectural History * Research Assistant in Architectural History Non-academic titles Most non-academic positions in architectural history can be grouped into one of the following five categories... * Preservation Planning and Administration : This employment category is similar to Main Street management listed below and is interrelated with the following historical research and evaluation category. Professionals in the present field are primarily concerned with the planning and administration of preservation programs, providing technical support to the community and attending public meetings. Positions in this category are typically more office based and require more interpersonal skills than the following category. : Principal employers are state and local government agencies, including historic preservation offices and nonprofit organizations. * Historical Research and Evaluation : This field is the counterpart to preservation planning and administration, above. It involves completing field surveys, conducting research and completing the reports reviewed by state and local government agencies. Compared to preservation planning and administration this field is less office oriented, requiring more on-site work and travel. : Principal employers are architectural firms, cultural resource firms and government agencies. * Historic Site Management and Curatorship : This field is analogous with museum curatorship but often includes aspects of historical research and evaluation, above and/or historic foundation management and administration, below. : Principal employers are local governments or private, nonprofit organizations. * Historic Foundation Management and Administration : Positions in this field are rarely entry level and generally require experience in nonprofit organization administration coupled with a background in architectural history. In many cases duties include those of historic site management as well. : Principal employers are historic foundations. * Main Street Management : Professionals in this field implement and manage downtown revitalization and preservation programs known as Main Street programs. These programs are assisted by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, National Main Street Center. In addition to sharing many of the activities in the preservation planning and administration category, Main Street managers are also involved with marketing and fundraising. : Principal employers are nonprofit organizations.

After initial melting the metal is then transferred to an AOD vessel where it will be subjected to three steps of refining; decarburization, reduction, and desulfurization. AOD was invented in 1954 by the Lind√© Division of The Union Carbide Corporation (which became known as Praxair in 1992).History. Unioncarbide.com (1917-11-01). Retrieved on 2013-12-28. Process= Decarburization  Prior to the decarburization step, one more step should be taken into consideration: de-siliconization, which is a very important factor for refractory lining and further refinement. The decarburization step is controlled by ratios of oxygen to argon or nitrogen to remove the carbon from the metal bath. The ratios can be done in any number of phases to facilitate the reaction. The gases are usually blown through a top lance (oxygen only) and tuyeres in the sides/bottom (oxygen with an inert gas shroud). The stages of blowing remove carbon by the combination of oxygen and carbon forming CO gas. :4 Cr(bath) \\\\+ 3 O2 ‚Üí 2 Cr2O3(slag) :Cr2O3(slag) \\\\+ 3 C(bath) ‚Üí 3 CO(gas) \\\\+ 2 Cr(bath) To drive the reaction to the forming of CO, the partial pressure of CO is lowered using argon or nitrogen. Since the AOD vessel isn't externally heated, the blowing stages are also used for temperature control. The burning of carbon increases the bath temperature. By the end of this process around 97% of Cr is retained in the steel.  Reduction  After a desired carbon and temperature level have been reached the process moves to reduction. Reduction recovers the oxidized elements such as chromium from the slag. To achieve this, alloy additions are made with elements that have a higher affinity for oxygen than chromium, using either a silicon alloy or aluminum. The reduction mix also includes lime (CaO) and fluorspar (CaF2). The addition of lime and fluorspar help with driving the reduction of Cr2O3 and managing the slag, keeping the slag fluid and volume small.  Desulfurization  Desulfurization is achieved by having a high lime concentration in the slag and a low oxygen activity in the metal bath. :S(bath) \\\\+ CaO(slag) ‚Üí CaS(slag) \\\\+ O(bath) So, additions of lime are added to dilute sulfur in the metal bath. Also, aluminum or silicon may be added to remove oxygen. Other trimming alloy additions might be added at the end of the step. After sulfur levels have been achieved the slag is removed from the AOD vessel and the metal bath is ready for tapping. The tapped bath is then either sent to a stir station for further chemistry trimming or to a caster for casting.

Like many English dialects, it is rapidly disappearing, due to the advent of increasing social and geographical mobility and the influence of the media. Despite this, there are still many people who profess some knowledge of Suffolk dialect, and there is an increasing number of young speakers who have a distinctive Suffolk accent, if not a dialect. This dialect has several characteristics which are closely related to Norfolk dialect neighbouring in the north, yet it retains many specific and unique terms and phrases which are distinctively recognisable. The Essex dialect, which is closely related, can still be heard in the speech of older people in Colchester and its surrounding towns in the northern parts of its corresponding county, where it has not yet quite been displaced by Estuary English or Cockney. Vocabulary * atum ‚Äî at home, e.g. \\"I left my jumper atum\\". * batter puddin' ‚Äî a common way to refer to Yorkshire pudding * bibble ‚Äî (of animals, esp. birds) to drink * boi (with an emphasis on the 'i') ‚Äî derived from boy but a term of familiar address, equivalent to 'mate' and can be used for a female (rarely) as well as a male addressee. In East Suffolk it is more likely to be buh or bor. A son is just as likely to call his father buh as vice versa. * dag ‚Äî early morning or evening mist, especially associated with coastal/marsh areas, possibly extends to the general eastern England dialect. * hull, hoss ‚Äî to throw although hoss is also a horse. * on the huh; on the wonk () ‚Äî uneven, unbalanced. * learn - also means teach. If taught a lesson you might be told \\"that'll learn yer\\". * pingle ‚Äî to be fussy about one's food * squit ‚Äî rubbish, nonsense, e.g. \\"He's talking squit\\". * waddledickie ‚Äî donkey * wog - Not an offensive noun but a verb meaning to steal. \\"Where did you a get that mooter from buh?\\",\\"I wogged it from Tescos car park\\". Mutations to certain words * \\"tomorrow\\" becomes \\"'amara\\" (with a hard glottal stop at the beginning). * \\"I'll\\" becomes \\"oi'll\\" (as in \\"oil\\") e.g. \\"Oi'll see yer 'amara\\". This also happens to other words with the 'ae' sound in, such as \\"five\\", which becomes \\"foive\\". (This was once common in New England, an area in the United States that was originally settled by East Anglians, though is rarely heard nowadays.) * \\"you\\" becomes \\"yer\\". * Yorkshire puddings are commonly referred to as 'batter puddings', pronounced 'batta puddins'. * \\"Mother\\" becomes \\"Ma'\\" as with many regional accents. * \\"rope\\" is pronounced \\"roup\\", with an emphasis on the 'u'. Likewise, \\"road\\" also sounds like \\"rud\\" (\\"rood\\" in the north of the county and in Norfolk) and \\"soap\\" sounds like \\"soup\\". This shows that Suffolk dialect is a context language. * most words ending in '-ing' become '-en', as in \\"Oi'm busy worken\\". * In Ipswich and up towards Reydon single syllable words can be pronounced as double syllables, for example dow-en tow-en. * \\"seen\\" and \\"been\\" become \\"sin\\" and \\"bin\\" respectively. * words such as \\"picture\\" and \\"lecture\\" become \\"pitcher\\" and \\"letcher\\". [this was once common in New England, an area that was originally settled by East Anglians, though it is somewhat dated there today.] * the perfect tense of \\"to show\\" changes from \\"showed\\" to \\"shew\\", e.g. \\"Oi shew er a pitcher\\". Also of \\"to snow\\". \\"That snew last night\\" - although becoming far less common. * words such as \\"shopping\\" and \\"office\\" mutate to \\"sharpen\\" and \\"arfice\\" as in \\"Oi'm gorn sharpen\\" or \\"Oi'm gorn de-oon-a poost arfice\\". * \\"going\\" becomes \\"gorn\\", but unlike Norfolk, \\"doing\\" becomes \\"do- en\\". * \\"hint\\" is used for \\"have not\\". * \\"hant\\" is used for \\"has not\\". * \\"Can I have a...\\" becomes \\"C'I've a...\\" (similar to \\"cover\\") * Words ending in '-day' become \\"-di\\" as in \\"Toosdi\\" [once common in New England, an area that was originally settled by East Anglians, though it is somewhat dated there today] and \\"yesterday\\" which becomes \\"yissdi\\". * \\"it\\" often becomes \\"e'\\", an approximate schwa sound, somewhere between an 'e' and a 'u', like a short 'er', e.g. \\"Oi int gorn-a do e'\\". * \\"to\\" becomes \\"a\\", another schwa sound, after the compound future i.e. \\"I am going to\\" becomes \\"Oi'm gorn-a\\" * \\"go\\" and other words with an 'o' sound become 'oo', such as \\"Oi'm mooen the lawn\\". * words containing sounds (as in 'ouch!') become something resembling 'e-oo'. This affects words like \\"now\\" which becomes \\"ne-oo\\". This is very similar to the Welsh 'ew' sound and is quite difficult to explain in writing ‚Äì it should be heard to get the full gist of it. A particularly interesting website contains a dialect map, which has an example of this pronunciation.A site containing geographically located accents on an interactive map of East Anglia ‚Äì the one in Thorington Street is particularly helpful in the pronunciation of \\"now\\" and similar words. * Pronunciation of words such as \\"bear\\" and \\"care\\" resemble New Zealand English in that they sound like \\"beer\\" and \\"keer\\". * In the Waveney area (and parts of Norfolk) there is a difference in the vowel sounds in \\"rowed\\" and \\"road\\". * Past participles are pronounced with an extra syllable. \\"Stewed\\" (as in to have slowly cooked) is not pronounced \\"stued\\", but \\"stue-uh\\" with the last syllable being more like a glottal stop. \\"Saved\\" is \\"sayv-uh\\", \\"cooked\\" is \\"cook-uh\\" etc. Some irregular verbs' past participles change to regular using this glottal stop formulation. \\"Ran\\" is replaced with \\"run-uh\\" and swam with \\"swim-uh\\". Grammar and linguistics Epenthesis occurs occasionally in Suffok dialect, as it does in Norfolk dialect. Words like \\"film\\" become \\"filum\\". Yod-droppings is very common, so words like \\"dew\\", \\"queue\\", \\"new\\" and \\"tune\\" will become \\"doo\\", \\"koo\\", \\"noo\\" and \\"toone\\" respectively. Suffolk dialect is non-rhotic, i.e. the 'r' in \\"hard\\" and similar words is not pronounced, unlike West Country English. Suffolk dialect has a strong use of the glottal stop. This is shown in words like \\"'amara\\" and \\"e'\\" ('tomorrow' and 'it'). It is common for \\"that\\" to replace \\"it\\". The intonation of words in Suffolk is very peculiar. Words have a notable range of rise and fall in pitch and can often sound as if the speaker were asking a question. This is one of the main features that distinguish Suffolk speech from Norfolk, which is characterised by a distinctive 'drawl'. Verbs very rarely conjugate, the only exceptions being 'to be' and 'to have'. Other verbs do not conjugate whatsoever, and the present and perfect tense is often the same, and context is used. This is shown in \\"Ee say he goo down-a poost arfice\\" for \\"he said he went to the post office\\".

It is the only member of the genus Orthiospiza. It was endemic to the high-elevation areas (above 1000 m) of Mount HaleakalƒÅ on the Hawaiian island of Maui. It has been speculated that they were pushed to extinction because of habitat loss. It is known only from fossil remains and likely became extinct before the first Europeans arrived in 1778. Description The highland finch was long and had a large, relatively weak, bill that was suited for feeding on soft fruits, seeds, and flowers such as ‚Äò≈çhi‚Äòa lehua blossoms. The finch is believed to have inhabited highland forest, though its fossils have also been found at lower elevations of the island. Extinction Because of its relatively early extinction, little is known about the species. It appears to have become extinct not long after the first Polynesians settlers who cleared some of the land for farming and introduced species for which the native birds had no defence. Five hundred years before Europeans made landfall to Hawaii, the bird was probably extinct. According to fossil records, their numbers declined rapidly in the early 16th century. It has been speculated that this species' visits to lower elevations was its undoing due to contact with avian diseases and pests. Finches were once known on all of the other larger Hawaiian islands, but the highland finch seems to have outlived the Oahu finch. Today, only about sixty percent of Hawaii have not been drastically altered. Many avian diseases and parasites also pose a major threat to Hawai\`i's native forest birds.

All Rational software products, including Rational Software Architect (RSA), are engineered as plugins that sit on top of the open-source Eclipse development platform. Installing Rational Software Architect gives the developer the option to either install RSA on top of an existing Eclipse v3.2 installation, or to install a new Eclipse v3.2 instance. Since RSA is Eclipse-based, it can take advantage of the market of third-party plugins for Eclipse, as well as plugins specifically for Rational tools. History Rational Software has a long history in application modeling, beginning in the early 1990s with the work of Grady Booch, James Rumbaugh and Ivar Jacobson. They combined competing modeling approaches to form what eventually became the Unified Modeling Language. Rational Software's first visual modeling and development tool was Rational Rose, a stand-alone modeling tool that integrates at the application programming interface (API) level with third-party Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) to support a variety of programming languages and other implementation technologies. While Rational Rose was an important step in bringing Model-driven development (MDD) closer to practicing software developers, it was found that only a small fraction of developers used modeling on a routine basis. A key problem was identified - developers didn't like to leave their IDE. They wanted visual modeling to be integrated‚Äînot with their IDE, but rather inside their IDE. Rational responded to this need in 2002 with Rational XDE software, providing an extended development environment for the next generation of programming technologies emerging at the time: Java and Microsoft .NET. IBM Rational XDE was characterized as the next generation of IBM Rational Rose ‚Äî not a new version of it (hence the name change), and not necessarily a replacement for Rose (since IBM Rational XDE was purposefully restricted to support only a select number of IDEs and implementation technologies). However, with each addition of a tool or capability came another point-to-point integration requirement. As more and more capabilities were added, Rational began to reach the practical limits of this style of tool integration. For the next-generation MDD products, it was only natural to build additional model-driven development functions on top of Eclipse to form a more complete MDD tool. IBM Rational Software Architect, IBM Rational Software Modeler and IBM Rational Systems Developer are the result of these changes, transforming the silos that previously defined modeling, development and code analysis into an integrated and unified design and development experience. RSA now co-exists with IBM Rational Rhapsody (acquired from Telelogic in 2008) and several other products, with the two mentioned being the major MDD solutions within Rational. Benefits The benefits of using Rational Software Architect include: *Build software architecture that supports change with a common platform that facilitates easy roundtrip engineering and synchronization of models and code. *Accelerate implementation and facilitate maintenance of a service-oriented architecture (SOA) solution, such as a web service, with tools and process guidance. *Use UML to ensure the numerous stakeholders within your software development projects are continuously communicating, and use defined specifications to jumpstart development.http://www-.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8PJ7_9.5.0/com.ibm.xtools.modeler.doc/topics/c_models_and_diagrams.html *Gain insight into distributed projects and tighter control of shared information.

Joel Flood had an elder half siblings Eleanor Bolling Flood Byrd (1864-1957)) and Henry De La Warr Flood (1866 -1921). He attended public schools in Appomattox and Richmond, Virginia, before receiving an undergraduate degree from Washington and Lee University. He also attended the University of Virginia School of Law (receiving a law degree) and Oxford University. Career After his father's death and his own admission to the Virginia bar in 1917, Flood began a legal practice in Appomattox, Virginia. He also took over what remained of the family plantation. During World War I, Flood served from March 29, 1918, until his discharge July 18, 1919, as a private in Company A, Three Hundred and Fifth Engineers, Eightieth Division. Appomattox County voters elected Flood Commonwealth attorney in 1919, a position once held by his elder half-brother Henry D. Flood. He was re-elected multiple times and served until November 8, 1932. Also, upon returning to Virginia, Flood became a member of the unofficial Byrd Organization created by his nephew Harry F. Byrd upon the demise of Sen. Thomas Staples Martin. Joel Flood also served as an assistant to Governor E. Lee Trinkle of Virginia in 1922‚Äì1926, and as special assistant to the Attorney General of Virginia from April 1, 1928, to July 1, 1932. Elected to Congress as a Democrat to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Henry St. George Tucker, he served from November 8, 1932, to March 3, 1933 (in the Seventy-second Congress). The seat was eliminated due to restructuring after the 1930 census. Flood was not a candidate for election to the Seventy- third Congress, but returned to his legal practice and agricultural pursuits. He also served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1936. He was appointed assistant United States attorney for the Western District of Virginia and served from June 1, 1939, to January 28, 1940. Virginia legislators elected him as a judge of the fifth judicial circuit of Virginia in January 1940, in which capacity he served until his death.

The battle started on 15 May 1815 and ended on 17 May, after the remaining Neapolitan force was routed at Mignano. Following his defeat at the Battle of Tolentino, Murat had fallen back to San Germano, now Cassino. There Murat reinforced his battered army with the Army of the Interior, which had been left in reserve to defend Naples during the war. Even so, most of the original Neapolitan force had been killed, wounded or deserted, and Murat's force only totalled 15,000. Meanwhile, General Nugent's force, who had marched from Florence, arrived in Rome on 30 April. From there, he marched towards Ceprano, where there was a minor engagement with a band of local militia. After receiving word of Murat's defeat at Tolentino, Nugent moved to intercept his retreat back to Naples. By 14 May, the Austrians were moving on Murat's position in San Germano. The following day, Murat decided to counterattack and drove back Nugent's vanguard, before attacking the entire Austrian line. However, another Austrian force of 25,000 men under the command of Frederick Bianchi, which had followed Murat from Tolentino, were now moving to surround the Neapolitan position. With the attack faltering, and the Neapolitans beginning to sustain substantial casualties, Murat pulled back to San Germano and formed a defensive position. But as soon as Nugent's force approached, the Neapolitans panicked and retreated. Murat fell back to Capua with a small portion of the army, whilst the bulk of the army regrouped and took up a position around Mignano. It was here that a force of about 1,000 hussars supported by j√§gers and Grenzers assaulted and routed the remaining 6,000 Neapolitans. The majority of the Neapolitans fled as soon as the battle started, with the Austrians eventually taking over 1,000 prisoners. With the entire Army of the Interior now in disarray, Murat chose to flee Italy altogether on 19 May and the Neapolitans sued for peace, resulting in the Treaty of Casalanza.  References  *Capt.

The mountain is named after Lester Wire, an American policeman of Salt Lake City, Utah, who in 1912 developed the first red-green electric traffic light. Mount Wire is a common spot for adventurous hikers and has many access trails, some created by nearby Red Butte Gardens. The east side of the University of Utah offers direct access to trails to the summit. Mount Wire formerly could be identified from other nearby mountains by its two passive microwave repeaters near the summit. These billboard like structures were used to bounce microwave signals over the mountain to the north-eastern parts of Utah. Mount Wire also houses an old airway beacon directly on the summit. An interesting man-made rock outcropping about halfway up the mountain looks like several lawn chairs in a row, and is a common rest stop for hikers. This stop offers views of Salt Lake City, and the Wasatch Mountains. Hiking Hiking to the summit can be moderately difficult as the terrain is fairly unforgiving. Trails are not marked, but are in good condition, depending on which side a hiker climbs. Access from the west side of the mountain is often the easiest, as the trails are clearer. Hiking the mountain takes about two hours for the average hiker, again depending on trail and weather conditions. It is advisable that any hiker wanting to get to the summit carry plenty of water and food. More athletic hikers can reach the summit in about 45 minutes with a water bottle in hand. The Summit Once on the summit, the entire Salt Lake Valley can be seen from North Salt Lake to Point of the Mountain and Draper. To the north, Antelope Island is clearly visible as is the neighboring mountain, Mount Van Cott. To the west, the entire Oquirrh mountain range. To the south and east, Emigration Canyon and the Wasatch Range are visible. An old airway beacon, now out of service, is on the highest point of the mountain and can be climbed for better views of the surrounding terrain. It has been vandalized by many people writing their names and the dates they reached the summit. Some of the dates are as old as 1954. Evidence of power to the beacon is still present in the surrounding area. Old electrical wire is strewn about in various places, and rusted conduit is still present, along with boxes that contained breakers. On November 9, 2013 the two large passive microwave repeaters directly southwest of the beacon were removed. These were used to reflect microwave radio communications from Salt Lake to northeastern Utah. They had also been heavily vandalized. An unimproved road for ATVs and four-wheel drive vehicles also exists for those who do not want to hike to the summit, and starts in Emigration Canyon directly to the east. This road begins on private property however, and reaching the summit via vehicle is strongly discouraged as parts of this mountain are on National Forest lands, where such vehicles are prohibited. The road terminates at the radio repeaters. Gallery File:RedButteJan2008.jpgRed Butte, directly adjacent to Mount Wire in January 2008.

He was first a fur hunter, a guide of westward bound caravans, a seeker of gold, and then a farmer and writer in his later years. He wrote an autobiography, first published with the title From Vermont to California, then a second edition with the title Death Valley in '49, that tells of the pioneer experience in the Far West, in particular the 1848 California Gold Rush. Early years  Manly was born near St. Albans, Vermont, the son of Ebenezer Manly and Phoebe (Calkins) Manly. In 1829, at the age of nine, Manly left for Ohio with his family. Later, as a pioneer, he went to Michigan, prior to statehood. He then went fur trapping in Wisconsin and in Ohio and the Dakota Territory. California gold rush  thumb In 1849, at the age of twenty-nine, Manly joined the thousands of American Forty-niners traveling to California to participate in the Gold Rush. He began traveling overland from Wisconsin. Floating the Green River Upon reaching the Green River, just west of South Pass Manly and a half dozen other men tried to float to California by use of an abandoned ferry they found down the Green to the Colorado River, then on to California. As had William Henry Ashley done almost twenty-five years previously, they put in the river in Wyoming, and floated through the canyon of the Gates of Lodore. But, unlike Ashley, who disembarked at the mouth of the Duchesne River after experiencing the treacherous canyon, Manly may have traveled further down, to present day Green River, Utah where the Old Spanish Trail crossed the river. Wherever they did disembark, they were met by Chief Walkara, who helped them to travel overland to the Wasatch Front. It was twenty years later, 1869, that John Wesley Powell's party was successful in floating further down the Green to the Colorado, then on to the California/Arizona border. Overland to California South of present-day Provo, Utah, Manly joined other Forty- niners traveling to southern California. In December, these pioneers became lost in the Great Basin Desert, and entered Death Valley having followed an inaccurate map for three weeks. Their food supplies were almost exhausted, and the oxen pulling their wagons were dying of starvation. Manly and his associate John Haney Rogers trekked 250 miles on foot across the Mojave Desert to Rancho San Fernando near Los Angeles, California to scout an evacuation route for the families trapped in Death Valley. There, they procured food and horses from Mexican villagers and were able to save their party by leading them to Rancho San Francisco. Life in California  Manly worked the gold fields for several months, then returned to his farm in Wisconsin via steamboat, crossing the isthmus of Panama overland. In 1851, Manly returned to California by the same method, arriving in San Francisco shortly after the fire of 1851 and continued in the goldfields until the fall of 1859, by which time he had saved enough money to buy land in the Communications Hill, San Jose area*, paying $16 an acre, $4,000 in all, where he planted a farm. In 1862, at the age of 42, Manly married Mary Jane Woods of Lodi, California.  Autobiography  Death Valley in '49 (1894) Manly wrote his first manuscript, referencing his diary (or notes) in early 1851 after returning east. He had it sent it to his parents to keep for him, but it burned in their farmhouse shortly thereafter. Upon learning this, he decided to put the traumatic past events behind him, and stopped keeping his diary. Thirty years later, his friends finally convinced him to recount his memories. By this time, his diary was \\"lost\\" (probably also burned, perhaps purposely) but he recreated events from memory and in 1886, Manly published \\"From Vermont to California\\" in Santa Clara Valley, a monthly agricultural review.* In the compilation of his memories, Manly contacted all the relevant persons possible, then with the aid of a publishing assistant wrote the greater part of his autobiography; Death Valley in '49 was published as a book in 1894 at San Jose from Pacific Tree and Vine Company. The title change was ostensibly to encourage sales, although Death Valley is not spoken of until the tenth chapter. Manly recounts in the book how, as the Bennett and Arcane families began their climb out of the valley through the Panamint mountains south of Telescope Peak, someone in the group, probably Sarah Ann Bennett (n√©e Dilley), or Mrs. J.B. Arcane, turned to take a last look eastward and said \\"Goodbye, Death Valley!\\" Only one of the emigrants, a Capt. Culverwell, died within the confines of the valley itself, while two other people, who Manly remembers in his book as Mr. Fish and Mr. Isham, were found dead along the trail west of the Panamint Range by Manly and his partner John Haney Rogers. Fish and Isham were members of another group of emigrants who called themselves the Jayhawkers, who had been traveling alongside the Bennett‚ÄìArcane Party from Salt Lake, Utah. The Jayhawkers had left the Bennetts sometime in the second or third week of December 1849 and walked out of Death Valley after butchering the last of their oxen for jerky along a path north of Telescope Peak, perhaps through the pass north of Tucki Mountain. This pass is today known as Towne Pass, after Captain Towne, the leader of \\"The Mississippi Boys\\" group of the 1849 Death Valley pioneers, and carries State Route 190 from Olancha to Stovepipe Wells. J. B. Arcane was possibly an emigrant from the Basque region of France; if so, the correct spelling of his name would be \\"Arcan\\". The first names of many of the 1849 Death Valley pioneers, including Captain Culverwell, Mr. Fish, Mr. Isham, and Captain Towne, are lost to history. Death  On February 5, 1903, Manly died at his home near Lodi, California. Legacy Manly rescued several families of pioneers from Death Valley during the 1849 California Gold Rush. For this reason, three geographic features in Death Valley bear his name: the Manly Beacon near Zabriskie Point, Manly Peak, situated to the south between Panamint Valley and the Death Valley, and Lake Manly, the ancient dried lake in the Valley. The actor Brad Johnson portrayed Manley on the first episode, \\"How Death Valley Got Its Name\\", of the 18-year syndicated television anthology series, Death Valley Days, originally hosted by Stanley Andrews. Phyllis Coates, in the first of her seven appearances on the program, was cast as the pioneer woman, Virginia Arcane. See also * Christian Brevoort Zabriskie * Walter E.

He attended St. Bonaventure University. Early life Kenneally began his athletic career at Boston Latin High School where he played varsity football, baseball, and held the city record for the fifty-yard dash. Upon graduating in 1919 he joined a group of local youths who were forming a semi-pro football team to play out of the local Knights of Columbus. He then followed his older brother and enrolled at St. Bonaventure, where in 1922, he began his collegiate career. During his four years there he was given sixteen varsity letters, including ones for boxing, as well as being the captain of the football team. Professional career=Pottsville Maroons/Boston Bulldogs Kenneally joined the NFL in 1926 with the Pottsville Maroons of Pottsville, Pennsylvania. After his rookie season, he was chosen as the team's captain and was also named to his first All-Pro Squad in 1927, as well as in 1928. At the close of the 1928 season the team succumbed to financial difficulties and was no longer solvent. He, along with his partner, then decided to purchase the Maroons franchise for $2,500. Kenneally then transferred the team to Boston where they became the Boston Bulldogs. Kenneally had many positions in the franchise; that of part owner, assistant Coach, team captain and offensive end. The Bulldogs were a competitive team and would finish the season at 4-4, but the Wall Street Crash of 1929 caused the team to fold. Chicago Cardinals Kenneally was back in the NFL in 1930, playing for the Chicago Cardinals. This season would prove to be one of his best in the league as he helped guide the struggling franchise to a 5-6 record, but also his only season for Chicago. The highlight of the season was an indoor exhibition game played at Chicago Stadium between the Chicago Bears and Cardinals with the proceeds aiding unemployment relief funds. Boston University In 1931, Kenneally accepted a coaching position at Boston University. He also utilized this sabbatical year by unsuccessfully trying to generate funds to restart his Bulldog franchise. He would lead the Marquette's to an undefeated season with a schedule that consisted of two professional opponents. They outscored their opponents that season 236 to 9. Boston Braves In 1932, Kenneally returned to Boston to play/coach for George Preston Marshall's Boston Braves. He played for the Braves for only one season as an offensive end and an assistant coach. Philadelphia Eagles In 1933, Kenneally left Boston with Lud Wray to play for and assist with the newly formed Philadelphia Eagles franchise. For the next three seasons, he would anchor the Eagles line, serve as the team's captain and assistant coach, and was again selected All-Pro during the 1934 season. He retired at the end of the 1935 season. After football=Boston Shamrocks Kenneally was offered the position of head coach and General Manager of the Boston Shamrocks of the newly formed American Football League. The Shamrocks would play a 19-game schedule which resulted in them capturing the league title as AFL champions for the 1936 season. However, the AFL was financially unstable and was soon forced to cease operations. The Shamrocks would continue to operate as an independent until 1938. Later years In 1939, Kenneally accepted the position of athletic director, head coach, and history teacher at Revere High School. In 1950, he left the Revere athletic program in a vastly improved state and became the line coach at Brandeis University for four years. He then returned to his old job as head of the Social Studies department at Revere, the position he would hold until his death. Kenneally died on September 3, 1968.

A food sample is carried out by subjecting the product to physical analysis. Analysis may be undertaken by or on behalf of a manufacturer regarding their own product, or for official food law enforcement or control purposes, or for research or public information. To undertake any analysis, unless the whole amount of food to be considered is very small so that the food can be used for testing in its entirety, it is usually necessary for a portion of it to be taken (e.g. a small quantity from a full production batch, or a portion of what is on sale in a shop) ‚Äì this process is known as food sampling. In most cases with food to be analysed there are two levels of sampling ‚Äì the first being selection of a portion from the whole, which is then submitted to a laboratory for testing, and the second being the laboratory‚Äôs taking of the individual amounts necessary for individual tests that may be applied. It is the former that is ‚Äòfood sampling‚Äô: the latter is analytical laboratory ‚Äòsub-sampling‚Äô, often relying upon initial homogenisation of the entire submitted sample. Where it is intended that the results of any analysis to relate to the food as a whole it is crucially important that the sample is representative of that whole ‚Äì and the results of any analysis can only be meaningful if the sampling is undertaken effectively. This is true whether the ‚Äòwhole‚Äô is a manufacturer‚Äôs entire production batch, or where it is a single item but too large to all be used for the test. Factors relevant in considering the representativeness of a sample include the homogeneity of the food, the relative sizes of the sample to be taken and the whole, the potential degree of variation of the parameter(s) in question through the whole, and the significance and intended use of the analytical result. Sampling by manufacturers  Food manufacturers and producers would need to satisfy themselves that any sample taken for analysis is sufficiently representative of the food for the analytical result to be meaningful. This is true whether the data are to be used as the basis of labelling declarations, assurance of compliance with legislative or other standards, monitoring of production as part of HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points), or for routine quality control. In the United Kingdom although various guidance is available, either from manufacturers‚Äô associations or from sources of standards such as British Standards Institution (such as British Standard BS6001), some of which may be relevant to certain food types. It is largely down to manufacturers to make their own evaluations of need and suitability. This must be translated into an assessment both of sample portion size and number, and the frequency of taking samples. Testing and Methods of Analysis To ensure food safety and quality, some food samples which are perishable require certain tests and analyses. The following tests and analyses can be conducted: * Food allergen testing * Food chemical analysis * Food contact tests * Food contaminant testing * Nutritional analysis and testing * GMO testing * Melamine contamination testing * Microbiological tests * Spiral plating for bacterial count * Pesticide residue testing * Veterinary drug residue testing * PCR food testing  Food law enforcement (UK) In the United Kingdom, enforcement is under the Food Safety Act 1990. Food sampling is undertaken primarily by local authorities and port health authorities for submission to public analysts for analysis. Much of the legislation relates to food as supplied to a consumer, meaning that every portion of a size of perishable food and foods at risk as may be supplied to a consumer has to comply, so that in such cases the sample submitted for analysis could simply be an entire consumer-sized portion. There are exceptions, however, such as the sampling of nut products for the presence of aflatoxins, which stipulate a primary sample size related to the size of the consignment ‚Äì with associated requirements for initial homogenisation to produce a smaller sample to be sent for analysis. The Food Safety Act 1990 affords a right for defence analysis, and for referee analysis in case of disputed analytical results, by stipulating that except where to do so would prevent effective analysis the sample must be divided into three parts. The UK Food Standards Agency provides supplementary guidance to the enforcement authorities to assist with the sampling process and associated decisions by sampling officers. There is no set frequency or rate for the sampling of food for law enforcement in the UK. Between the 1930s and 1990s there had been a guideline minimum rate for sampling for chemical analysis (not including samples for microbiological examination) of 2.5 samples per annum per 1000 head of population, however that was an arbitrary figure and more recent thinking suggested that the selection of a frequency for sampling should be based on risk. In this context risk includes all 'consumer protection' issues such as pecuniary disadvantage from substandard or counterfeit products, as well as risk to health. The Association of Public Analysts was commissioned by the Food Standards Agency to look into this, culminating in a scheme for Risk Based Sampling, though it has not yet been adopted by the enforcement authorities.

Impervious was launched by Martinolich Shipbuilding Co., San Diego, California, 29 August 1952; sponsored by Miss Mary Lin Moore; and commissioned 15 July 1954, Lt. Comdr. A. T. Ford in command.  First Far East tour  Following shakedown and mine warfare training off the California coast, Impervious was reclassified MSO-449 on 7 February 1955. She sailed 1 July with her division for duty in the Far East with the U.S. 7th Fleet, arriving Sasebo via Pearl Harbor 5 August. During this deployment, she operated with ships of the Republic of Korea Navy and visited Taiwan before returning to her home port, Long Beach, 15 February 1956. During the next two years she operated out of Long Beach.  Her second cruise to the Far East  Impervious sailed for her second U.S. 7th Fleet deployment 3 January 1958, and during the next 6 months trained in Japanese waters. She also helped train Nationalist Chinese crews during April and May, preparing them to help to preserve the freedom and independence of Taiwan. The minesweeper returned to Long Beach 15 July 1958, and during September took part in a giant amphibious exercise off Camp Pendleton, California.  Joint U.S.-Canadian exercises  In April 1959 Impervious interrupted her regular training schedule to take part in a joint mine warfare exercise with Canadian ships, and spent the rest of the year on training exercises in California waters. In early 1960 the ship prepared for another deployment to the Far East, sailing 3 May for Japan. During August she participated in maneuvers with Korean and Nationalist Chinese ships, and in October Impervious operated with units of the Philippine Navy in similar operations off Corregidor. She sailed via Guam and Pearl Harbor to Long Beach, arriving 16 November.  Supporting nuclear testing at Johnston Island  Impervious in 1954. The ship spent 1961 and early 1962 on important readiness operations, visiting several West Coast ports, and sailed again for U.S. 7th Fleet duty 7 April 1962. After training in the Philippines the minesweeper spent part of July on patrol with Vietnamese Naval units off Danang, and the Navy supported the South Vietnamese people in their fight for freedom. She visited Hong Kong and Yokosuka before arriving Pearl Harbor 8 September 1962. During October and November, Impervious took part in atomic tests at Johnston Island, and arrived Long Beach 21 November. In March 1963 the ship took part in another large amphibious operation, \\"Operation Steelgate\\", then worked out of Long Beach before again joining Canadian ships for mine warfare exercises off British Columbia in November. She got underway for the western Pacific again 8 May 1964, and after stopping at various islands moved to the coast of South Vietnam in September for special operations supporting the American Advisory unit. After mine exercises off the Philippines she returned Long Beach 7 December 1964. The following 12 months were spent in tactics and exercises along the coast of southern California, overhaul at Los Angeles, California, and readiness operations to prepare her for another Far Eastern deployment assisting Allied forces to defend freedom in Southeast Asia. Persian Gulf War service USS Impervious (MSS-449) next to USS Leader (MSO-490) and other ships aboard Super Servant 3. Impervious was lifted to the Persian gulf following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. She was loaded aboard the Dutch heavy lift ship Super Servant 3 on 19 August 1990 at Norfolk along with USS Leader (MSO-490), USS Adroit (MSO-509) and USS Avenger (MCM-1). She was offloaded 5 October 1990 in the middle east. Impervious returned to Norfolk on 14 November 1991 with USS Leader (MSO-490) and USS Adroit (MSO-509) aboard Super Servant 4. She participated in minesweeping operations to clear mines for anticipated d-day style landing by US Marines as part of the diversionary force which allowed land forces to take Iraqi Artillery positions from behind. On 28 February 1991 at 0500 they were ordered to storm the beaches at 0300 they were ordered to stand down as Iraq had surrendered and the war was over. She also did escort duty for the battleships USS Missouri and USS Wisconsin. as part of two naval battle groups built around the aircraft carriers USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and USS Independence to the Gulf, where they were ready by 8 August. She did riggings for MH 53 Airborne Mine Countermeasures minesweeping helicopters stationed aboard the USS Tripoli LPH 10. This was the minesweeping gear use to clear anchored mines such as the one that hit Tripoli. Tripoli proceeded into the northern Persian Gulf and assumed duties as flagship for Airborne Mine Countermeasures operations there with MH 53 deployed aboard. On the morning of 18 February 1991,at 0436 ( 4:37 a.m.) Tripoli was rocked by a mine explosion on her starboard bow. The explosion ripped a 16 by 20 ft hole in the ship's hull and injured four sailors. The Tripoli was towed off of three other unexploded mines by two MCM ships. After 20 hours of damage control, the ship was stabilized and was actually ready to resume operations. However her HM-14 fuel tanks were damaged by the mine hit and she was unable to deploy her HM-14's due to a lack of fuel. The Impervious and sister MSO's were her escorts. USS Impervious was responsible for removing these mines that threatened the Tripoli. Soon after the Iraqi invasion, it became clear that Iraq was laying mines in international waters. U.S. ships discovered and destroyed six mines during December. The U.S. Mine Countermeasures Group (USMCMG) was established with the objective of clearing a path to the beach for a possible amphibious landing and battleship gunfire support. The minesweepers USS Adroit (MSO 509), USS Impervious (MSO 449), and USS Leader (MSO 490) along with the newly commissioned mine countermeasures ship USS Avenger (MCM 1 ) arrived in the Gulf aboard the heavy-lift ship Super Servant III. More than 20 Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) teams were also deployed to support the mine countermeasures force. Allied minesweepers from Saudi Arabia, Great Britain and Kuwait, and the MH-53 Super Stallions of Mine Countermeasures Helicopter Squadron 14 joined the MCM effort. After months of training off Dubai, United Arab Emirates, USMCMG staff embarked in USS Tripoli (LPH 10) on 20 January, and proceeded to the northern Gulf waters to perform their mission. As flagship for the combined operation, Tripoli's flight deck was the base for the mine-sweeping helicopters. Six British minesweepers joined their U.S. counterparts, with British and U.S. warships providing air defense. USMCMG began its work 60 miles east of the Kuwaiti coastline, working initially to clear a 15-mile long, 1,000-yard wide path. The mine-clearing task force spent the first few weeks of Desert Storm pushing 24 miles to \\"Point Foxtrot,\\" a 10-mile by 3.5-mile box which became the battleship gunfire support area south of Faylaka Island. While sweeping further toward shore, the task group was targeted by Iraqi fire control radars associated with Silkworm missile sites inside Kuwait. Task force ships moved out of Silkworm range and worked to locate the radar site. During those maneuvers on 18 February, Iraqi mines found their mark. Within three hours of each other, Tripoli and USS Princeton (CG 59) were rocked by exploding mines. As damage control teams successfully overcame fires and flooding aboard Tripoli and Princeton, Impervious, Leader and Avenger searched for additional mines in the area. Adroit led the salvage tug USS Beaufort (ATS 2) toward Princeton to tow her to safety. Tripoli was able to continue her mission for several days before she was relieved by USS La Salle (AGF 3) and USS New Orleans (LPH 11) and proceeded to Bahrain for repairs. New Orleans provided the helicopter deck while the mine group staff moved aboard La Salle to coordinate the operation. Princeton restored her TLAM strike and AEGIS anti-air warfare defense capabilities within fifteen minutes of the mine strike, whereupon she reassumed duties as local anti-air warfare coordinator and remained on station, providing defense for the mine countermeasures group for an additional 30 hours, until relieved. Charts and intelligence captured from Iraq showed the mine field where Tripoli and Princeton were hit was one of six laid in a 150-mile arc from Faylaka Island to the Saudi-Kuwaiti border. Within that arc, there were four additional mine-lines‚Äîa total of more than 1,000 mines‚Äîlaid over a five-month period. Three days later, the massive 31-ship amphibious task force moved north to assist in battlefield preparation as the deadline for the ground offensive neared. As Wisconsin and Missouri steamed in the vicinity of recently cleared \\"Point FOXTROT,\\" their gun crews continued to pound Iraqi targets.

Early life Sirop's mother was a couturier's mannequin in Paris for the House of Paquin, and from seeing his mother at work Sirop got the ambition to make a career in the world of haute couture. He has said that by the age of seven, he knew that he wanted to be \\"either a fashion designer, a magician or the Sun King\\". Career At the age of seventeen, Sirop was apprenticed to Yves Saint Laurent, beginning work in his atelier, where he learned about dress materials and sewing. In 1978, he showed some sketches to Hubert de Givenchy, who hired him as an assistant designer. He stayed with Givenchy's studio until 1989, and while there his clients included Audrey Hepburn. Then from 1989 to 1996 he was a designer for Hanae Mori. He also turned to research and writing, going on to publish two books, A Historical Overview of the House of Paquin (1989) and Jacqueline Delubac (1994). He became an expert on the history of costume, and is consulted in this area by museum curators. In 1995, Sirop was Hubert de Givenchy's chosen successor as chief designer of the Givenchy label, but Bernard Arnault, head of the Louis Vuitton Mo√´t Hennessy conglomerate which owned Givenchy, took the view that Sirop was not well enough known to the public and appointed John Galliano instead. Dominique Sirop couture In September 1996, Sirop opened his own couture house, and less than a year later he was admitted to the exclusive Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture Parisienne, making his house one of the ten official French couture fashion houses. This entitles its principal designer to be called a grand couturier. Sirop has high-profile clients and produces fashion collections every season for more than one of the six major fashion weeks: Milan, Paris, London, Tokyo, Los Angeles, and New York. His designs are often featured in fashion magazines, including Vogue and Madame Figaro. Since January 2000, Sirop's shop and atelier has been at 14, Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor√©, 75008 Paris, a historic building which includes its own theatre.

It aired on MBC from March 19 to May 22, 2007 on Mondays and Tuesdays at 21:55 for 20 episodes. A police procedural crime drama that integrated crime scene analysis with action, suspense, and romance, H.I.T represented a departure from the usual Korean drama subjects of love and relationships. Plot Tough, sharp-shooting, and just a bit unkempt, Cha Soo-kyung (Go Hyun-jung) is the leader of Investigation Team 1 at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency. She is haunted by her failure, years ago, to catch a serial killer who wound up murdering her fianc√© and escaping. When a new serial killer whose crimes resemble the old killer's surfaces in Seoul, Cha is appointed as the first female detective to head H.I.T, the Homicide Investigation Team, charged with capturing the murderer. Soo-kyung's work is her life, and she is most comfortable when she is with her team. Because of her determination and work ethic, she immediately clashes with newly appointed D.A. Kim Jae-yoon (Ha Jung-woo) from the Prosecutor's Office who was assigned to work for H.I.T. Jae-yoon is a laid-back playboy whose greatest priority is to enjoy life. Despite their differences and personal conflicts, the two make a surprisingly formidable crime-fighting duo, and slowly realize that they have a lot to learn from each other. Soo-kyung must overcome her past and her grief for her dead boyfriend, and come to terms with her feelings for Jae- yoon. Cast=Main characters *Go Hyun-jung as Cha Soo-kyung :Cha Soo- kyung is a lieutenant of Investigation Team 1 at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, and the first female chief of homicide. She is single. Too busy to go home, she spends five days a week at the women's dorm in the Police Agency. Her hair is always messy and she walks around the office in sweats that has \\"Seoul Police Agency\\" written on it in huge print. Due to her athlete's foot, she wears toe socks that even the guys refuse to be seen in. Her only hobby is playing ball with her team. She has become tougher than anybody else since she has worked and lived among rugged detectives and criminals, but no one has been to her home. D.A. Kim Jae-yoon is the first one to set foot into her house. The place is simple and neat, and surprisingly, there is a teddy bear on her bed. She did indeed have a feminine side. But the biggest surprise comes from her shoe closet. It is filled with an incredible number of high heels. :She leads a life that confuses even herself on whether she's a man or a woman, but her shoes satisfy her feminine desire. Jae-yoon insists that her shoeholic tendency represents her yearning of her lost femininity and the reality that blocks her from exposing her feminine side. \\"Dump the toe socks and be a woman,\\" he pleads but she casually blows it off. She shuts him up by solving a case with her expansive knowledge of shoes. She has the ability to recreate a crime scene with the shoe prints at the scene and predicts the criminal's occupation or traits by analyzing the shape and texture of the shoe. :She's a great shooter and is greatly attached to her guns. She has never had to shoot anyone yet but she's always ready for the inevitable circumstance. She believes that the gun puts her on an equal standing with men. She thinks that a woman with a gun versus a man with a gun is more equal than a woman versus a man. That's why she prefers a 38mm revolver to a 22mm. :Soo-kyung believes that: #\\"A cop without a sense of justice is nothing but a gangster.\\" #\\"Victims are not tools of investigation, they are the purpose.\\" #\\"Dream teams don't exist. They are created.\\" #\\"Justice must take place when it can or it may never will.\\" #\\"Han Sang-min is the only man in my life. The rest fall into three categories; colleagues, criminals or victims.\\" *Ha Jung- woo as Kim Jae-yoon **Kang Soo-han as young Kim Jae-yoon :Kim Jae-yoon is a rookie district attorney at the Prosecutor's Office. He is single and an individualist who believes life is about having fun. The youngest son from a wealthy family, Jae-yoon is so smart that he has never failed a single test in his life. Overly optimistic to the point of being immature, he loves women, gambling, and traveling around the world. He has an extensive knowledge in music and art and whatever else he's interested in. Because he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, there is nothing that he wants or expects in life. :He thinks the road to happiness is to have less and do less. He went to graduate school simply because he didn't want to get a job. After fulfilling his military duty as a KATUSA, he studied for the CPA and passed the test. But deciding that he didn't want to be an accountant, he studies for the judicial exam and passes. After graduating from the Judicial Research and Training Institute at the age of 30, he tries to land an easy position as a DA but ends up in the \\"Organized Crime and Violent Crime Analysis Team.\\" However, he isn't that disappointed. The fact that they appointed a rookie D.A. like him to be in charge must mean that the team will last only about three months as so many other special task forces have before, or it must be a publicity stunt, or a ploy to get more budget. So it's the perfect place for someone like him who doesn't have any sense of justice or the drive to catch criminals. He just hopes to kill time and become a lawyer when the time is right. He wishes he won't get tangled up in a difficult situation. :Jae-yoon believes that: #\\"Protector of the people? Just do your job. That will make everyone happy.\\" #\\"A husband who talks too much about his family often turns out to be a wife- beater and a leader who talks too much about team-work often turns out to be a bad leader.\\" #\\"Try not to want anything too much, whether it's love or work. Your happiness ends the moment you start to desire.\\" #\\"It's better to give up as soon as you can.\\" #\\"Women are like bad habits. Keep them around all the time but always think about quitting.\\" #\\"Being a pioneer is great. But I don't have to be that person.\\" *Kim Jung-min as Kim Yong-doo :Kim Yong-doo is a 40-year-old ex-cop who currently runs a bar. He was demoted after a serial murder case that took the life of Soo-kyung's boyfriend Han Sang-min 14 years ago. He tried to forget about the incident by being a traffic police officer but that didn't work and he opened a bar after retiring. His old colleagues and cops are his regulars. He feels guilty about Han's death and he's compassionate towards Soo-kyung who took refuge in her work after losing her loved one. Somewhere along the line, that compassion turned to love. He hopes that Soo-kyung will leave the past behind and move on but she seems to have a problem opening herself up and she still has the tendency to link any homicide case to that old case. :He may have quit the force, but the reason he is lingering around by opening a bar near the agency and asks around for any information whenever there's a murder case and collects any related information, is because he still can't let go of it either. :When Jae-yoon comes into Soo-kyung's life, he doesn't know whether to be happy or sad. :He's a good bar owner who treats even the rudest customer well and is Soo-kyung's best friend who has stayed by her side for 15 years. Both of them go on dates and hook each other up with people they know, but still joke around, saying, \\"Is it considered cheating if I marry someone else?\\" \\"I think so.\\" *Yoon Ji- min as Jung In-hee :Jung In-hee is a doctor at the National Institute of Scientific Investigation, specializing in hypnosis. She's also a criminal analyst at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency's VICAT (Violent Crime Analysis Team). She analyzes crime and refreshes the suspect's or the victim's memory with hypnosis. She also uses a lie detector when a case is assigned to VICAT. :She has known Jae-yoon since childhood, as their families were close. He is her confidant as well as her crush.

The battle took place mere days after the Battle of Tolentino on the 3rd May 1815. The siege of Ancona was one of the last battles in Italy during the Neapolitan War. The city of Ancona was the last major Italian city to surrender. It was fought between Napoleon's forces in Ancona, Italy and the Anglo-Austrian alliance during the One Hundred Days‚Äô campaign. The Anglo-Austrian alliance eventually defeated Napoleon's forces, thus helping expel the French from Eastern Italy. It also contributed to the elimination of the Bonaparte monarchy proposed by Murat and led to the establishment of the Papal state.Reinerman, Alan. \\"Metternich and Reform: The Case of the Papal State, 1814-1848.\\" The Journal of Modern History 42.4 (1970): 524.

Ancona was defended by a garrison of Napoleon's troops, which was composed of 1,500 men. This garrison had been part of Caracossa's brigade, which fought in the Battle of Tolentino.Schneid, Frederick C. Napoleon's Italian Campaigns 1805-1815. Westport, CT: Praeger, 2002. Print. The French lost 500 men to the Anglo- Austrian bombardment before they ultimately surrendered on the 30th of May.  Ramifications  The siege of Ancona cemented the loss of Napoleon's forces in Italy. Ancona was the last major Italian city to surrender to the Austrians, and the battle came shortly before the downfall of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo.Dugdale-Pointon, t (16 November 2000), Napoleonic Wars (1799-1815), http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/wars_napoleonic.html As a result of the expulsion of the French, there arose a power vacuum in Italy. The Italians adamantly refused to support anyone who came in the name of Napoleon. Unification of Italy was Murat's ideal. Murat was an Italian prince who supported Napoleon's bid for power in Italy. As a result of anti-Napoleon sentiment, Murat's attempt to install a Bonaparte monarchy even after the defeat of Napoleon failed to gain traction. His attempt to establish a monarchy in Italy was rejected, and the Bonaparte royalty was completely deposed by the English in Naples at the same time as the end of the siege of Ancona; the 30th May, 1815. Murat had earlier been defeated in battle by the Austrians on the 3rd May 1815 at Tolentino. Unfortunately, this meant that the constitution he proposed before his defeat never took hold. However, his ideals of an independent Italy played a role in the Risorgimento, decades later.Martinengo-Cesaresco, Evelyn Lilian Hazeldine Carrington. The Liberation of Italy, 1815-1870. London: Seeley, 1895. Print. The elimination of the Bourbon influence in Italy after the siege of Ancona paved the way for the Papal state that took power in 1814. The Papal state supported a policy of conservatism in Italy, upholding Austrian influence and opposing revolution and unification. Due to this conservative policy, the Papal state hindered the unification of Italy for many years. The administration of the Papal state was in place until the overthrow of Metternich in 1848.

Most reclaimed lumber comes from timbers and decking rescued from old barns, factories and warehouses, although some companies use wood from less traditional structures such as boxcars, coal mines and wine barrels. Reclaimed or antique lumber is used primarily for decoration and home building, for example for siding, architectural details, cabinetry, furniture and flooring. Wood origins This dining hall uses wood recycled from barns for flooring, walls, and furniture. In the United States of America, wood once functioned as the primary building material because it was strong, relatively inexpensive and abundant. Today, many of the woods that were once plentiful are only available in large quantities through reclamation. One common reclaimed wood, longleaf pine, was used to build factories and warehouses during the Industrial Revolution. The trees were slow-growing (taking 200 to 400 years to mature), tall, straight, and had a natural ability to resist mold and insects.Floridata: Pinus palustris They were also abundant. Longleaf pine grew in thick forests that spanned over of North America.Longleaf Pine Forests and Longleaf Alliance Home Reclaimed longleaf pine is often sold as Heart Pine, where the word \\"heart\\" refers to the heartwood of the tree.https://www.longleaflumber.com/reclaimed-heart-pine/ Longleaf Lumber Previously common woods for building barns and other structures were redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) on the U.S. west coast and American Chestnut on the U.S. east coast. Beginning in 1904, a chestnut blight spread across the US, killing billions of American Chestnuts, so when these structures were later dismantled, they were a welcome source of this desirable but later rare wood for subsequent reuse. American Chestnut wood can be identified as pre- or post-blight by analysis of worm tracks in sawn timber. The presence of worm tracks suggests the trees were felled as dead standing timber, and may be post-blight lumber. Barns are one of the most common sources for reclaimed wood in the United States. Those constructed through the early 19th century were typically built using whatever trees were growing on or near the builder's property. They often contain a mix of oak, chestnut, poplar, hickory and pine timber. Beam sizes were limited to what could be moved by man and horse. The wood was often hand-hewn with an axe and/or adze. Early settlers likely recognized American oak from their experience with its European species. Red, white, black, scarlet, willow, post, and pine oak varieties have all been used in North American barns. Mill buildings throughout the Northeast also provide an abundant source of reclaimed wood. Wood that is reclaimed from these buildings includes structural timbers - such as beams, posts, and joists - along with decking, flooring, and sheathing. These buildings often have no economic or reuse possibility, can be a fire hazard, and may require varying degrees of environmental cleanup. Reclaiming lumber and brick from these retired mills is considered a better use of materials than landfill-based disposal. Another source of reclaimed wood is old snowfence. At the end of their tenure on the mountains and plains of the Rocky Mountain region, snowfence boards are a valued source of consistent, structurally sound and reliable reclaimed wood.https://www.centennialwoods.com/blog/reclaimed- lumber.html Centennial Woods] Other woods recycled and reprocessed into new wood products include coast redwood, hard maple, Douglas Fir, walnuts, hickories, red and White Oak, and Eastern white pine. Properties Reclaimed lumber is popular for many reasons: the wood's unique appearance, its contribution to green building, the history of the wood's origins, and the wood's physical characteristics such as strength, stability and durability. The increased strength of reclaimed wood is often attributed to the wood often having been harvested from virgin growth timber, which generally grew more slowly, producing a denser grain. Reclaimed beams can often be sawn into wider planks than newly harvested lumber, and many companies claim their products are more stable than newly-cut wood because reclaimed wood has been exposed to changes in humidity for far longer. Reclaimed lumber industry The reclaimed lumber industry gained momentum in the early 1980s on the West Coast when large-scale reuse of softwoods began. The industry grew due to a growing concern for environmental impact as well as declining quality in new lumber.http://www.p2pays.org/ref/12/11761.pdf On the East Coast, industry pioneers began selling reclaimed wood in the early 1970s but the industry stayed mostly small until the 1990s as waste disposal increased and deconstruction became a more economical alternative to demolition. A trade association, the Reclaimed Wood Council, was formed in May 2003 but dissolved in January 2008 due to a lack of participation among the larger reclaimed wood distributors.Recycled lumber enjoys rebirth  Home Channel News  Find Articles at BNET.com Reclaimed lumber is sold under a number of names, such as antique lumber, distressed lumber, recovered lumber, upcycled lumber, and others. It is often confused with salvage logging.Reclaimed Wood Names: What do they mean? LEED The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System is the US Green Building Council's (USGBC) benchmark for designing, building and operating green buildings. To be certified, projects must first meet the prerequisites designated by the USGBC and then earn a certain number of credits within six categories: sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, innovation and design process. Using reclaimed wood can earn credits towards achieving LEED project certification. Because reclaimed wood is considered recycled content, it meets the 'materials and resources' criteria for LEED certification, and because some reclaimed lumber products are Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified, they can qualify for LEED credits under the 'certified wood' category.Usgbc: Leed Drawbacks With reclaimed material being so popular, it is becoming more difficult to source. With such a high demand, some sellers try to pass newer wood off as antique. It is also common (although not necessarily done intentionally) for species to be misidentified because it is difficult to tell the difference in older material unless it is cut open and examined, leaving the material less desirable. Professionals in the field and with established reclaimed wood enterprises do not have difficulty identifying the species. Reclaimed lumber sometimes has pieces of metal embedded in it, such as broken off nails, so milling the material can often ruin planer knives, saw blades, and moulder knives. Nail-compatible saw blades are advisable for the same reason, as well as for safety. The alternative is to remove all metal from the reclaimed lumber, which is a costly and tedious process commonly achieved by scanning each piece of wood with a metal detector and then manually pulling out all nails, bolts, bullets, screws, buckshot, and other miscellaneous metal hardware. This process can make the cost of reclaimed lumber higher than new lumber. Many sources of reclaimed wood cannot verify what the wood might have been treated with over its lifetime. This uncertainty leads to fears of harmful offgassing of volatile organic compounds associated with lead paint or various stains and treatments that may have been used on the wood. These fears are particularly pressing when the wood is for an interior application.

Known for his wide body of work featuring the United States Armed Forces, he is considered by many to have been the \\"dean of military illustrators.\\" Biography McBarron was born in Chicago, Illinois, where he lived all his life. He was born and raised in a family home on the Near North Side of Chicago that was rebuilt by his maternal grandfather after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. He began formal art training at age seven in classes at the Art Institute of Chicago. Upon graduation from Waller High School (now known as Lincoln Park High School), Chicago, he made a sudden decision to forego admission to Northwestern University's Medill School to pursue comprehensive study at the Art Institute of Chicago. His favored artists and illustrators included Van Dyck, Winslow Homer, Howard Pyle, NC Wyeth, JC Leyendecker, Maxfield Parrish and John Singer Sargent. Battle of Chippewa While informally researching military uniforms and weapons, McBarron realized that many illustrations of military scenes were inaccurate. He became committed to knowledgeable portrayal of detail and historical accuracy. An example is his mature 1975 work Soldiers of the American Revolution: A Sketchbook. To support his studies, McBarron compiled an extensive personal library and collection of arms, armour, uniforms, artifacts, and research resources and archives. He drew on these and public sources for reference when creating his more than 60-year body of work. McBarron created all his illustrations from his studio in Chicago. Throughout his entire career, he maintained professional studios in Downtown Chicago, as well his home-based studio. McBarron often drafted and completed his work in non-stop fashion. He embraced and used to his advantage then-contemporary mediums such as Black-and-White photos, Polaroid photos, and Kodak 16-mm movies. His use of photography and other such resources helped him produce illustrations and artworks that had accurate details. To go along with his reading and research, McBarron visited and studied many of the major battlefields and historic sights located in the original 13 colonies, the Western Reserve, and Canada. He was known for his ability to comprehend and explain complexities of clothing and uniform construction. McBarron would recreate uniform patterns which he would use to sew replicas to serve as historically accurate models for his work. While attending a luncheon with a fellow historian who was writing about a particular uniform, McBarron quickly sketched out its pattern on a cocktail napkin. The fellow historian picked up McBarron's impromptu sketch, and later included its reproduction within an authoritative work on military dress. McBarron often served as an expert consultant to the United States Marine Corps History Division, United States Army Center of Military History, the Smithsonian Institution, various military museums, and individual branches of the US Armed Forces. He also consulted with Encyclop√¶dia Britannica and World Book Encyclopedia. McBarron served as a mentor, resource, and guide to many devotees, illustrators, and historians. Mr. McBarron made uniform illustrations for the Military Collector & Historian, journal of the Company of Military Historians, from the work of Lieutenant Colonel Edwin North McClellan, USMC (Uniforms of the American Marines 1775 to 1829 1932, reprinted 1974, 1982): :\\"Captain Robert Mullan's Company of Continental Marines, 1779\\" (MC&H;, volume I, number 1, plate #2, pp 2-3) :\\"U.S. Marine Corps, Circa 1805-1818\\" (MC&H;, volume II, number 2, plate #24, pp. 25-28) While known for his military illustrations, throughout his career he also created illustrations for fashion, advertising and mail order catalogues. McBarron produced such popular-culture icons as Captain Midnight, the Jolly Green Giant and Buster Brown. He portrayed himself as a subject within his works, and can be found in virtually all his military depictions. Where's Waldo? illustrator Martin Handford, in a Time Magazine article, cited McBarron as his primary influence. Marriage and family McBarron married Mary Cecilia Pugh. Together they had a son and a daughter. After his death, McBarron was interred next to his wife at Calvary Cemetery, Evanston, Illinois. Professional work Among H.

Weir was a Covenanter who professed a particularly strict form of Presbyterianism. His spoken prayers earned him a reputation for religiosity which attracted visitors to his home in Edinburgh. He served under James Graham, Marquis of Montrose, as a lieutenant in the Army of the Covenant. He was known as the \\"Bowhead Saint\\",Clan Weir because his residence was near the top of the West Bow, off the Grassmarket, and \\"saint\\" was a popular epithet for Calvinist zealots. Biography Weir was a native of Carluke (Kirkstyle) in Lanarkshire, descendant of one of the most powerful and ancient families of the County, the Weir-de Veres. He was the son of Thomas Weir, Laird of Kirkton, and his wife Lady Jean Somerville who was reputed to possess clairvoyant powers. His grandfather was William Weir, or Vere, of Stonebyres Castle who married Lady Elizabeth Hamilton. Weir was a signatory to the Solemn League and Covenant and an officer in the Scottish anti-Royalist army. As a Lieutenant, he served in Ulster during the Irish Rebellion of 1641. In 1650, he obtained the post of commander of the Edinburgh Town Guard, thus acquiring the rank of major. When the defeated royalist general Montrose‚Äîbranded a traitor for changing sides‚Äîwas brought to Edinburgh for execution, Weir notoriously mocked and abused him during his custody.James Grant, Cassell's Old and New Edinburgh, a partwork published by Cassells from 1880. Following retirement, Weir fell ill in 1670, and from his sick-bed began to confess to a secret life of crime and vice. The Lord Provost initially found the confession implausible and took no action, but eventually Weir and his spinster sister, Jean Weir (known to her friends as 'Grizel'), were taken to the Edinburgh Tolbooth for interrogation. Major Weir, now in his seventies, continued to expand on his confession and Grizel, having seemingly entirely lost her wits, gave an even more exaggerated history of witchcraft, sorcery and vice. She related how many years before a stranger had called in a \\"fiery\\" coach to take her brother to Dalkeith and how during the short trip another man had given him \\"supernatural intelligence\\" (Chambers) of the Scots' defeat at Worcester that same day. (In fact, Cromwell's Commonwealth Commissioners in Scotland had been based in Dalkeith and would have been among the first to know the outcome of the battle‚Äîthough not, of course, on the same day.) Grizel maintained that Weir derived his power from his walking stick, topped by a carved human head, giving rise to later accounts that it had often been seen parading down the street in front of him. A depiction of Weir's coach careering down the West Bow at midnight Whilst as a high-ranking public figure Weir was not believed at first, his own confession together with that of his sister sealed his fate. Both were quickly found guilty at their trial and sentenced to death. While awaiting execution, they were confined in the former leper colony at Greenside below the Calton Hill. Weir was garroted and burned at the GallowleeEdinburgh and The Lothians (literally, \\"gallows field\\") on the road between Edinburgh and LeithGrassmarket ‚Äì Edinburgh.Com ‚Äì History- Major Thomas Weir (a site later occupied by the Shrubhill tram depot, then bus garage, near Pilrig on Leith Walk). His last words, while being urged to pray for forgiveness, were reported as, \\"Let me alone‚ÄîI will not‚ÄîI have lived as a beast, and I must die as a beast\\". Weir's stick was consigned to the flames after him, reportedly making \\"rare turnings\\" in the fire. Shortly before his end Weir had made a further public confession of incest with his sister, who was executed in the Grassmarket.Major Weir Scottish Clans Tartans Kilts Crests and Gifts The remains of the Weirs were buried at the base of the gallows at Shrub Hill, as was the custom of the time. Aftermath Weir's house in the West Bow stood empty for over a century because of its reputation for being haunted. It was said that one of Weir's enchantments made people ascending the stair think they were descending in the opposite direction. It was eventually bought cheaply in about 1780 by an ex-soldier William Patullo who moved in with his wife. They are said to have fled the house on their first night there after experiencing a strange apparition of a calf approaching them in the night, propping itself up with its forelegs on the bed-end and staring at them in bed. According to Walter Scott, the house, which remained unoccupied after the incident, was demolished in 1830. The story of Weir has been proposed as an influence on Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, by Robert Louis Stevenson..BBC ‚Äì Press Office ‚Äì Ian Rankin investigates Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde for BBC Four The 2000 novel The Fanatic by James Robertson features Weir as a character and uses the events surrounding him as a central aspect of the novel's narrative and themes.

It can be found only in South Africa, in the hotter and more arid inland mountains of Clanwilliam, Tulbagh and Ceres, and can grow up to more than 150 cm. The leaves are covered with sticky hairs and produce a resin (rather than a mucilage as in most other sticky carnivorous plants), enabling it to catch insects, such as wasps or bees, and very occasionally small birds.McPherson, Stewart. 2008. Glistening Carnivores: the Sticky-leaved Insect-eating Plants. Poole, Dorset, England: Redfern Natural History Productions. It benefits indirectly from catching prey, as several species of Pameridea are unaffected by the stickiness of the leaves. R. dentata then absorbs the nitrogen from the droppings of the insects, resulting in an obligate mutualistic relationship. This relationship is effectively indirect carnivory, which some believe is enough to classify R. dentata as a proper carnivorous plant with flypaper-type traps.

Story There has been a breakout of radiation sickness on Space Station Icarus, and Garritt Sherova has been sent to investigate. After arriving at the station, it becomes apparent that radiation is only one of many problems; the captain is dead and a power struggle has ensued. To make matters worse, Icarus is on a collision course with the Sun and nobody is able to correct the station's course. Sentient takes place in real-time. The player's actions in the early part of the game determine which path they will travel through later on. Which members of the crew are spoken to and what they are told plays a strong part in the plot's development. The player's performance through the game determines which of the nine endings they receive. Development The game was developed by Psygnosis' external Chester Studio and Pompeii Studios over 1995‚Äì1997. The characters in the game were based on facial scans of staff at the studio. The Windows version supports 3D acceleration, but only using the Matrox Mystique and the Creative Labs 3D Blaster. Early in the game's development, Mitch Gitelman of Pompeii Studios stated, \\"The organic transmission of information was one of our primary design goals, along with logical, nonlinear plot developments. Gossip and information transmission between computer-controlled characters takes the multilayered scenarios down many different avenues. It is our hope that this human interaction system will allow for maximum replayability without compromising the many stories in the game.\\" Reception At the time of release, the PlayStation version of the game was praised for its ambitious and intricate gameplay and its replay value, but criticised for its sloppy graphics, particularly the odd-looking character faces. Most critics expressed astonishment that the conversation system produces dialogue which is not only fairly complex, but generally sounds natural and realistic. Overall assessments were mostly positive. GameSpot likened Sentient to classic text adventures. GamePro stated that \\"the intricacy and suspense make the brainwork rewarding (and replayable, too, with six endings).\\" Shawn Smith of Electronic Gaming Monthly commented, \\"Sentient gets some major points for originality. I've never played a game with so many different possibilities.\\" Dan Hsu and Crispin Boyer felt that the pace was too slow and would be unappealing to many gamers, while Sushi-X shared Smith's more positive assessment. A Next Generation reviewer concluded, \\"Ultimately, Sentient succeeds at what it set out to do, which was to forge some new territory in graphic adventures.\\" The PC release was more negatively received, with critics commenting that the graphics look terrible unless the user has a 3D Blaster or Matrox Mystique card, and that the interface is clumsy and tedious, making the player wade through several menus to choose responses. Next Generation added that the game should have used a text parser for its complex dialogue system. GameSpot expressed admiration for the game's ambition and immersion, but felt the cumbersome interface made it a chore to play. Next Generation similarly concluded, \\"All in all, the execution makes the whole thing a complete waste of time. It's big, it's ugly, and it's as frustrating as hell to work with. ... Unless you have enough patience to wear down granite, don't bother with this one.\\" The reviewer said that Sentient did not hold up on PC in part because graphic adventures were not as scarce on that platform as they were on the PlayStation.

Laverty won the Golden Osella (Best Screenplay) at the 2007 Venice Film Festival. An ambitious working class British woman, played by Kierston Wareing, tries to improve her lot by setting up her own business. Plot Angie (Kierston Wareing), a young woman frustrated after being fired from her thirtieth dead-end job, decides to set up a recruitment agency of her own, running it from her kitchen with her friend and flatmate Rose (Juliet Ellis). Angie is able to build a successful business, while also dealing with a neglected son who gets in trouble at school and parents who disapprove of her venture. She also has to keep reassuring Rose that they will become legitimate once the business is on a firm financial footing - they do not have a licence, but Angie at least insists on only hiring workers with papers, not illegal immigrants. Meanwhile, Angie becomes romantically involved with Karol (Les≈Çaw ≈ªurek), an English-speaking Pole who is in the same predicament as those Angie recruits. She also helps Mahmoud, his wife and two young daughters, much to Rose's distress. Mahmoud has been ordered deported, but he has gone into hiding to avoid a likely jail sentence back home in Iran. Despite Rose's misgivings, Angie becomes increasingly eager to do whatever it takes to build the business. When Angie anonymously informs the government about a camp of immigrants, that is the final straw for Rose. She quits. Disaster strikes when one employer refuses to pay twenty of Angie's workers the ¬£40,000 they are owed. They blame her, and some of them take drastic action. They first kidnap her son Jamie (Joe Siffleet), then tie her up. After searching her flat, they take her profits (about a quarter of what they are due) and leave, but not before warning her that they want the rest or she will never see her son again. Soon after, Jamie shows up, unaware that the \\"policemen\\" he was talking to were fake. In the final scene, Angie abandons her scruples completely; she travels to the Ukraine to knowingly recruit illegal workers, offering to obtain forged papers for them. Critical response Though the film was not widely reviewed, it received generally positive reviews from critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 84% based on 19 reviews, 16 of 19 were judged to be positive reviews, with an average rating of 6.6 out of 10. Peter Howell wrote in the Toronto Star, \\"Newcomer Wareing delivers an award-worthy performance as the steely Angie, who is impossible to hate even as she descends deeper into the moral abyss.\\" Awards For her performance as Angie, Wareing received a nomination for the Best Actress award at the 2008 BAFTA Television Awards, losing out to Dame Eileen Atkins. The film received the \\"White Camel\\" (best film prize) at the sixth edition of the Sahara International Film Festival, the only film festival in the world celebrated in a refugee camp.

Uses  Screen printed and digitally printed domed labels. Domed labels are used in many applications. Equipment manufacturers apply them as permanent marking for their products as they are durable and their three-dimensional appearance catches the eye. Domed labels are much more permanent than many other labels and do not show wear; the clear polyurethane substance, even after curing (hardening), is self-healing. Minor scratches or cuts heal themselves and the label looks like new once again. Several clothing manufacturers use domed labels as disposable items by affixing them to in-store hangers. The hangers are shaped in such a way that the customer will touch the label first when picking up the article of clothing for inspection. This initial tactile feel adds to the perceived value of the garment. Costume jewelers have also used domed labels for their products. An example of a domed label application for tactile purposes can be seen in the photo. At the bottom left there is an example used to label the gearshift knob of an automobile.

It has awl-shaped leaves with entire margins, crowded at the tip of the branches. These are set with tentacles that secrete a sticky, shiny resin from the thicker gland at their tips, that catch many airborne items. At the center of the shoots appear inflorescences between July to October that consist of up to twelve flowers in spikes, each on a short flower stalk, with a bract at its base. The 5-merous flower is about 2¬Ω cm (1 in) in diameter and has pinkish purple or white petals. The plants do not digest the trapped insects, but the bug Pameridea roridulae sucks out their juices and the plant absorbs nutrients from the bug's droppings. It is therefore considered a protocarnivorous plant. It is called Gorgons dewstick, fly bush or fly catcher bush in English and vliebos, or vlie√´bossie in Afrikaans. (but these names are also used for its relative R. dentata). R. gorgonias is an endemic species home to the southwest of the Western Cape province of South Africa.  Description  Gorgons dewstick is a slender shrub growing up to 60‚Äì100 cm high. It has fairly stout brownish stems, that show conspicuous horizontal leaf scars. The leaves are crowded at the tip of the branches, the youngest upright, but the leaf base steadily bending down until eventually fully reflexed. When a shoot has flowered, it dies off, but produces side shoots below the old inflorescences. The leaves are set alternately and lack both stipules and leaf stalk. The leaf blade is line-shaped, up to 12 cm (6 in) long and ¬Ω cm (0.2 in) wide, tapering towards the tip. It has an entire margin, that carries many with long tentacles topped by teardrop-shaped glands. The upper surface of the leaves is covered with much smaller, shorter tentacles intermingled with white hairs. The lower surface of the leaves is hairless but the on the raised mid-vein is a row of short tentacles. The flowers are set in a spike with a terminal flower, and may consist of up to twelve star-symmertical flowers, each on a short flower stalk with a bract at its base.

It also connotes a higher authority given to lower level functionaries, executives, and workers. This can be in any organization of any size, from a governmental authority to a corporation. However, the context in which the term is used is generally that of larger organizations. This distribution of power, in effect, has far- reaching implications for the fields of management, organizational behavior, and government. The decisions arising from a process of decentralized decision-making are the functional result of group intelligence and crowd wisdom. Decentralized decision-making also contributes to the core knowledge of group intelligence and crowd wisdom, often in a subconscious way a la Carl Jung's collective unconscious. Decision theory is a method of deductive reasoning based on formal probability and deductive reasoning models. It is also studied in a specialized field of mathematics wherein models are used to help make decisions in all human activities including the sciences and engineering. (See also Game theory, Uncertainty, Expectation maximization principle.)  History  Decentralization and centralization have been consistent themes throughout history pertaining to governmental authority and political theory. From the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, there have been periods of centralization and decentralization in societies worldwide. Almost any political movement, from the rise of city states in Roman times, to the later rise and downfall of feudal empires during the middle ages, to the rise of fascism in Germany prior to World War II, to the late 20th century formation of the European Economic Union, the history of Europe has been one of cycles of centralization and decentralization. MIT Professor Thomas W. Malone explains that \\"decentralization has three general benefits: # encourages motivation and creativity # allows many minds to work simultaneously on the same problem # accommodates flexibility and individualization Decentralized decision-making, Malone says, tends to create less rigidity and flatter hierarchies in organizations. When upper management delegates decision-making responsibilities, there also exist wider spans of control among managers, creating a more lateral flow of information. Thus there will be more bottom up directional information flow, allowing for more innovation and efficiency closer to the means of production. This increased flow information thereby allows for innovation in what is called Total quality management.

The story revolves around the activities of commodity trader Miguel Lienzo, who is a Jewish refugee from the Portuguese Inquisition. Recovering from near financial ruin, he embarks on a coffee trading scheme with a Dutch woman, kept secret because it is forbidden by his community council. Miguel navigates the social structures of the Amsterdam business world, the politics of the council, and the plots of competitors bringing this new import to Europe. The character of Miguel Lienzo is the great-uncle of Benjamin Weaver, the protagonist of Liss's first novel, A Conspiracy of Paper. This novel is set about 60 years earlier, but is not a prequel; as stated by Liss, Miguel Lienzo is a very different kind of character from the English great-nephew whom he would never meet. The book has been published in translation into Chinese, Danish, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese and Turkish. Plot summary The year is 1659. Miguel Lienzo is in financial trouble as a result of some trades in sugar that have gone poorly. He is being pursued by his creditors and is looking for a way out of his current problems. His friend Geertruid persuades him to invest in coffee, a little-known commodity in Europe. After trying coffee for himself at a Turkish coffee house, he is convinced that there could be a market for the beverage in Europe. He devises a scheme to manipulate the price of coffee by buying up as much as possible on several exchanges around Europe simultaneously. Miguel gets Geertruid to front the money for the initial purchases, and he arranges for most of the foreign trades, ordering 90 barrels of coffee through an Amsterdam broker named Isaiah Nunes. Meanwhile, Miguel is living with his younger brother Daniel and his young wife, Hannah, who is pregnant. Miguel owes money to Daniel as well as to other creditors, but his coffee scheme will take months to pay off, and he is on the verge of losing more money on some bad investments in brandy futures contract. His long-time enemy Solomon Parido approaches him with overtures of friendship and an offer to connect Miguel with a buyer for the brandy futures. Though skeptical, Miguel goes through with the trade, only to see the price of brandy rise just before close of trading. The trade mitigated Miguel's potential losses, but cost him money he might have earned if he had retained them. On the advice of Alonzo Alferonda, Miguel is able to earn a significant profit on whale oil futures, which costs Parido considerably and allows Miguel to pay off many of his debts and regain some standing in the community. Several intrigues follow. Miguel finds a mutual attraction with his sister-in-law Hannah. Parido catches wind of Miguel's interest in coffee, and appears to have coffee interests of his own. Parido uses his influence with the Jewish ruling council, the Ma'amad, to censure Miguel. Miguel receives threats from creditors still waiting to be paid, even as he is himself waiting to be paid for his profits in the whale oil trade. He begins to have suspicions about Geertruid's trustworthiness and takes some of her coffee-investment money to pay some of his creditors. Miguel and Daniel's relationship is strained by many of these events. When Nunes's coffee shipment arrives in Amsterdam, it appears that Nunes has promised it to both Parido and Miguel Lienzo. Parido and Lienzo place a wager on the final price of coffee for the day and both attempt to manipulate the price in their favor. Miguel wins the wager and a considerable sum, but betrays Geertruid in the process, believing Geertruid to having been Parido's spy. He repays her initial investment but cuts her out of the profits she was expecting. Hannah deceives Daniel by informing him that their baby is actually Miguel's and, along with his bankruptcy, he informs her he is leaving the city and will grant her a divorce. She goes to Miguel's house and they plan to marry. Miguel learns that Geertruid was working for Alferonda, not Parido; he tries too late to make amends. Geertruid leaves the city with her companion, Hendrick, but not before Hendrick beats Miguel's sometime-friend Joachim in retribution for Miguel's betrayal. Miguel and Hannah have a son, Samuel, and later another boy. His prosperous future now lies securely in the coffee trade.

Critical reception  The Coffee Trader was published in 2003 to generally positive reviews. Several reviewers noted the novel's depth of historical detail, including mention of the three pages of bibliography at the end of the book. Others mention the intricacy of the plot; writing for The New York Times, Thomas Mallon described \\"the book's commercial plot to be as complicated as it is expert\\", requiring occasional narrative recaps to help the reader keep track of its intricacies. Despite the \\"careful attention\\" to setting, Mallon wished for a bit more \\"time and place\\" as a break from the rapid and intricate plot. Writing in the Jewish Quarterly Review, Adam Sutcliffe identified The Coffee Trader as among \\"the underinvestigated emerging genre of the 'port Jew novel,'\\" citing as other examples In an Antique Land by Amitav Ghosh, The Nature of Blood by Caryl Phillips, and The Moor‚Äôs Last Sigh by Salman Rushdie. Historical accuracy The novel shows considerable attention to historical detail. In the \\"historical note\\" appended to the novel, the author notes that many modern business methods, especially those having to do with the stock market, came into being in 17th-century Holland. New York Times reviewer Thomas Mallon writes that the Amsterdam of the novel is \\"a kind of information age, where wealth follows from what one knows or can trick others into believing.\\" Historian Adam Sutcliffe also sees the seeds of modernity in the novel's portrayal of Amsterdam \\"as a crucible of modernity is based above all in the easy contact between Jews and non-Jews,\\" but finds that Liss goes too far in this portrayal, saying that \\"there appears to be almost no cultural distance between... an intensely Calvinist [Dutch] society... [and] the Sephardim... steeped in their very different Iberian sensibility.\\" Sutcliffe concludes, \\"The commercial, cultural, and political modernity of this Amsterdam milieu underpins the familiar fascination of The Coffee Trader. The less recognizably modern aspects of Sephardic life are marginal to Liss's narrative, but they Liss has said that the novel was originally focused on the chocolate trade, but he switched the focal commodity because \\"coffee was a better fit\\" and that \\"\\"coffee and business go so naturally together.\\" In an interview, Liss was asked whether Miguel was based on a particular historical figure; her replied that Miguel \\"is entirely made up based on the sort of character I wanted to see in that situation.\\" Works CitedExternal links * Reader's Guide with discussion questions, from the author's website Category:2003 American novels Category:American historical novels Category:Novels set in Amsterdam Category:Novels by David Liss Category:Fiction set in the 17th century Category:Coffee culture Category:Novels about drugs Category:Works about coffee Category:Novels set in the Dutch Golden Age ","title":"The Coffee Trader"},{"id":"13422946","text":"The outer works of Fort McHenry in Baltimore harbor, although built in the 1860s, are broadly similar to early First and Second System forts built prior to the War of 1812, with low earthworks, although mounting much larger cannon and reinforced with masonry. The cannon are 8-inch converted rifles (lined down from 10-inch Rodman guns) and a 15-inch Rodman gun, typical of the post- Civil War era. The Statue of Liberty is built on top of Fort Wood of the Second System Seacoast defense was a major concern for the United States from its independence until World War II. Before airplanes, many of America's enemies could only reach it from the sea, making coastal forts an economical alternative to standing armies or a large navy. After the 1940s, it was recognized that fixed fortifications were obsolete and ineffective against aircraft and missiles. However, in prior eras foreign fleets were a realistic threat, and substantial fortifications were built at key locations, especially protecting major harbors. The defenses heavily depended on fortifications but also included submarine minefields, nets and booms, ships, and airplanes. Therefore, all of the armed forces participated in seacoast defense, but the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers played the central role in constructing fixed defenses. Designs evolved and became obsolete with changes in the technology available to both the attacking forces and the defenders. The evolution of the U.S. seacoast defense system is generally identified among several \\"systems\\", which are somewhat defined by the styles used, but more so by the events or trends which periodically stimulated new funding and construction. The division of the early forts into the First and Second Systems was made by later historians, and appears officially in an 1851 report by Chief Engineer Joseph Totten, probably the most prolific builder of masonry forts in American history.Wade, p. 185 Early defenses At the beginning of the American Revolutionary War, many coastal fortifications already protected the Atlantic coast. Prior to independence from Britain the colonies bore cost and responsibilities for their own protection. Urgency would wax and wane based on the political climate in Europe. Most defenses were artillery protected by earthworks, as protection from pirate raids and foreign incursions. In the American colonies and the United States, coastal forts were generally more heavily constructed than inland forts, and mounted heavier weapons comparable to those on potential attacking ships. Though seldom used, the forts were a deterrent. During the Revolution additional forts were built by both sides, usually to meet specific threats. Those built by Patriot forces were called Patriot batteries. First System When the United States gained independence in 1783, the seacoast defense fortifications were in poor condition. Concerned by the outbreak of war in Europe in 1793, the Congress created a combined unit of \\"Artillerists and Engineers\\" to design, build, and garrison forts in 1794, appointed a committee to study coast defense needs, and appropriated money to construct a number of fortifications that would become known as the First System.Wade, pp. 22-24 Twenty significant forts at thirteen harbors were approved for construction, mostly with traditional low walled structures with low sloped earthworks protecting wood or brick walls.Wade, pp. 55-60 The conventional wisdom was that soft earth would cushion the effect of cannon fire against the walls, and that low walls presented less exposure to projectiles. Walls were laid out at angles to each other forming a system of bastions, resembling a star layout, so that enemy forces could not mass against the bottom of a wall beneath the vertical field of fire from the wall; defenders on any wall could see and fire on the base of the adjacent walls. The angled walls also reduced the chance for more destructive straight-on hits from cannonballs. Most First System forts were relatively small, and with some exceptions mounted only one tier of cannon, on the roof of the fort. Additional \\"\\" (located near the waters the forts protected) outside the forts provided more firepower. Four of the First System forts were rebuilds of colonial forts, Fort Constitution in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Fort Independence in Boston, Massachusetts, Fort Wolcott in Newport, Rhode Island, and Fort Mifflin in Philadelphia.Wade, pp. 10-13 Lacking trained engineers to supervise the work, Secretary of War Henry Knox placed a number of European engineers under contract.Wade, pp. 14-15 Although some fine forts were constructed, for the most part enthusiasm and funding waned and little work was completed. Most of the partially finished earthworks and wooden structures deteriorated before they were needed to defend against the British in 1812. 50-pounder Model 1811 Columbiad (7.25 inch or 184 mm bore) built for Second System forts 50-pounder Model 1811 Columbiad (7.25 inch or 184 mm bore) and center-pivot mounting designed by George Bomford as an experimental coastal defense gun. This gun was built in 1811 as a component of the Second System.Wade, pp. 137-139 Photographed in Clear Lake, Wisconsin. Second System In 1802, Congress separated the artillerists and engineers into separate corps and directed the Corps of Engineers to create a military academy at West Point, New York. One of the driving forces for establishing the new academy was the need to divorce the United States from its reliance on foreign engineers. In 1807-1808, new concerns over a possible war with Great Britain prompted President Thomas Jefferson to renew fortification programs; this has come to be known as the Second System. One event that foreshadowed war was the Chesapeake‚ÄìLeopard Affair.Wade, pp. 115-144 One common weakness among the typical low-walled open bastion or star forts was exposure to enemy fire, especially to new devices designed to explode in mid air and rain shrapnel down on the gunners. Gun emplacements which were at an angle to the sea were vulnerable to a solid shot running parallel to the wall taking out a row of guns and gunners with one enfilading shot. In the late 1770s, a French engineer, the Marquis de Montalembert, advocated a major change in the design of fortresses to address these problems. His design protected a fort's gunners by placing most of them in covered casemate walls with openings for the guns. By stacking rows of casemates in high walls more guns could be mounted along shorter walls. This was particularly important for seacoast fortifications, which had only a limited time in which to fire at passing enemy ships. To build these tall forts, walls had to be built of masonry, but be very thick in order to withstand the pounding of cannon fire. Despite the goal of building multi-tiered forts, only a few of these were completed, notably Castle Williams in New York Harbor. Most completed Second System forts generally resembled First System forts, with a one-tier star fort supplemented by water batteries.Wade, pp. 130-131, 241-246 The Second System was distinguished from the First System by greater use of Montalembert's concepts and the replacement of foreign engineers by American ones, many of them recent graduates of the new United States Military Academy superintended by Major Jonathan Williams, who not only instructed the new engineers in new ideas of coastal defense, but also designed and constructed a prototype, Castle Williams on Governors Island in New York Harbor.Wade, p. 152 Again, several fine forts were produced, but generally projects went unfinished, and between the First System and Second System little was prepared to resist the British in the coming War of 1812. However, no First System or Second System fortress was captured by the British. The British succeeded in entering Chesapeake Bay by capturing a fort on Craney Island near Norfolk and bypassing the area's two other forts. The invasion of Baltimore was prevented by Fort McHenry and supporting forts and troops. These included shoreline batteries at Forts Babcock and Covington to the west, Fort Look-Out (or the Six-Gun Battery) on the peninsula to the rear in the west, a temporary naval battery across the Patapsco channel to the east at Lazaretto Point, and sunken ships blocking the channels on either side of Fort McHenry, along with 20,000 militia dug in on the east side of the town at \\"Loudenschlager's Hill\\" (later \\"Hampstead Hill\\" in today's Patterson Park).Wade, pp. 178-179 The intense all-night bombardment of Fort McHenry by the British ships offshore was memorialized by Francis Scott Key, a Baltimore lawyer who witnessed the ferocious attack from one of the vessels, and put down his thoughts watching the barrage‚Äîwhich failed to either destroy the fort or subdue its defenders‚Äîin a four-stanza poem, which became known as The Star- Spangled Banner and later became America's national anthem. In some cases even incomplete forts (some with fake wooden cannon barrels painted black pointed out the embrasures) were sufficient to deter attack from the sea. But, undefended and unfortified, Washington, D.C., the national capital, was burned after the land militia forces were routed at the Battle of Bladensburg northeast of the capital in Prince George's County, Maryland. Washington had one fort, which the British bypassed, Fort Washington on the Potomac River just below Alexandria, Virginia, whose commander ordered the magazine blown when the passing British fleet appeared nearby, after the British had already occupied Washington.Wade, pp. 177-178 The present Fort Washington was built on the site of the destroyed Fort Washington in the early 1820s as part of the Third System.Weaver, pp. 123-124 Among the many important and historic documents lost in the British burning of the Library of Congress were the plans to the first Fort Washington (begun as Fort Warburton) and other Second System forts. Third System Fort Point - San Francisco - example of a mid-1800s Third System fort Damaged wall - Fort Pulaski on the coast of Georgia Civil War 10-inch Rodman cannon at Fort Knox (Maine) In 1816, following the War of 1812, Congress appropriated over $800,000 for an ambitious seacoast defensive system which was known as the Third System. A Board of Engineers for Fortifications, appointed by President James Madison, visited potential sites and prepared plans for the new forts. The Board's original 1821 report established the policy which would remain in place for most of the 19th century. The original report suggested 50 sites, but by 1850 the board had identified nearly 200 sites for fortification. The Army built forts at 42 of these sites, with several additional sites containing towers or batteries. The forts were originally intended to mount mostly 42-pounder (7 inch or 178 mm) seacoast guns; however, due to a shortage of these weapons many 32-pounder (6.4 inch or 163 mm) seacoast guns and 8-inch (203 mm) and 10-inch (254 mm) Columbiads were mounted instead. The main defensive works were often large structures, based on combining the Montalembert concept, with many guns concentrated in tall, thick masonry walls, and the Vauban concept, with layers of low, protected-masonry walls. Most Third System forts had at least two tiers of cannon; the First and Second System forts often had only one tier. Construction was generally overseen by officers of the Army's Corps of Engineers. Smaller works guarded less significant harbors. U.S. Army engineer officer Joseph Totten and former French engineer officer Simon Bernard (commissioned a brevet brigadier general in the U.S. Army) designed the larger forts and key features of most of the smaller forts, such as the Totten casemate, which allowed a good field of fire with a minimal embrasure size.Weaver, pp. 3-5, 11-12 By the end of the Third System in 1867, 42 forts covered the major harbors along the coastline. While most of the forts were completed, several of the forts‚Äîmostly in New England‚Äîwere still under construction. A few of these forts, such as Fort Preble, Fort Totten, and Fort Constitution, were readied for armament even though they were far from complete. The Corps of Engineers listed the forts from Northeast to Southwest, then to the Pacific Coast. The same order is used here for the new- construction forts of the Third System: * Penobscot River, Maine: Fort Knox; * Kennebec River, Maine: Fort Popham; * Portland Harbor, Maine: Fort Gorges, Fort Scammell, Fort Preble; * Portsmouth, New Hampshire: Fort McClary, Fort Constitution; * Boston Harbor, Massachusetts: Fort Warren, Fort Independence; * New Bedford, Massachusetts: Fort at Clark's Point (later Fort Rodman);Also called Fort Taber * Newport, Rhode Island: Fort Adams; * New London, Connecticut: Fort Trumbull; * New York City, New York: Fort Schuyler, Fort at Willets Point (later Fort Totten), Fort Tompkins, Fort Richmond, Fort Hamilton, Fort on Sandy Hook, New Jersey (later Fort Hancock); * Pea Patch Island, Delaware: Fort Delaware; * Baltimore Harbor, Maryland: Fort Carroll; * (Washington, D.C.) Maryland: Fort Washington; * Norfolk, Virginia: Fort Monroe, Fort Calhoun (later Fort Wool); * Beaufort, North Carolina: Fort Macon; * Wilmington, North Carolina: Fort Caswell; * Charleston, South Carolina: Fort Sumter; * Savannah, Georgia: Fort Pulaski; * St. Marys River, Florida: Fort Clinch; * Key West, Florida: Fort Taylor; * Dry Tortugas, Florida: Fort Jefferson; * Pensacola Bay, Florida: Fort Pickens, Fort Barrancas, Advanced Redoubt, Fort McRee; * Mobile Bay, Alabama: Fort Morgan, Fort Gaines; * New Orleans, Louisiana: Fort Massachusetts, Fort Pike, Fort Wood (later Fort Macomb), Fort Jackson, Fort St. Philip, Fort Livingston; * San Francisco Bay: Fort Point, Fort Alcatraz. In addition, several towers and batteries were constructed in support of the forts or at lesser harbors. First and Second System forts were renovated during the system as well, and readied for the larger cannon prevalent during that period.Weaver, pp. 5-9, 16-17 Civil War Again, changes in technology affected design; the higher velocity ordnance of new rifled cannons crushed and penetrated the masonry walls of Third System forts. Severe damage was inflicted to forts on the Atlantic Coast during the Civil War. For example, Fort Sumter in South Carolina was bombarded into surrender by Confederate batteries in 1861, and reduced to rubble during Union efforts towards its recapture. In 1862 Fort Pulaski in Georgia was forced to surrender after only 30 hours of bombardment with rifled cannon, primarily large-caliber Parrott rifles. Many of the larger smoothbore cannon (32-pounder and up) were rifled and equipped with breech bands to support larger powder charges and extend their effective range during the Civil War. This process is referred to as \\"banded and rifled\\". During the Civil War, naval officers learned that their steamships and ironclad vessels could run past Confederate-held Third System forts with acceptable losses, such as at Mobile Bay. The urgencies of war required that new forts or improvements be constructed quickly and at low cost. Partially completed Third System forts were finished, but new construction was mostly wood-revetted earthworks. Frequently earthworks were built near a Third System fort in order to supplement its firepower, but often they were stand-alone fortifications. In some cases, cannon from masonry forts were dispersed to earthen bunkers where they were better protected. The fortification of San Francisco Bay is a good example, where the typical Third System Fort Point at the mouth of the bay was effectively replaced by dispersed earthworks and low-walled fortifications nearby on Alcatraz Island, Angel Island, the Marin Headlands, and Fort Mason. Following the war, work on masonry forts ended in 1867, leaving several incomplete.Weaver, pp. 53-54 Minefields Robert Fulton used the term \\"torpedo\\" to describe an underwater explosive device in 1805. Samuel Colt experimented with electrical firing of the torpedo. During the Civil War, these underwater mines became an important supplementary defense measure. The Confederacy, without a large navy to protect its harbors, relied on mines extensively to deter attacks by Union ships. Electrically fired torpedoes, later termed mines, controlled from mine casemates ashore were developed during and after the Civil War as part of coastal defenses.National Park Service, Torpedo Defense - COAST DEFENSE OF THE POTOMAC Coast artillery weapons during the Civil War Two of the Civil War's heavy weapons: an 8-inch (200-pdr) Parrott rifle (front) and a 15-inch Rodman gun (rear) at Battery Rodgers, Alexandria, Virginia. Numerous types of seacoast artillery were used in the Civil War. Except for the 20-inch Rodmans, of which only three Army weapons were built, the following list includes only widely deployed weapons. See Siege artillery in the American Civil War for more information. * Smoothbore weapons:Ripley, pp. 17-44, 71-86 * 32-pounder (6.4-inch or 163 mm) and 42-pounder (7-inch or 178 mm) seacoast guns * 8-inch (203 mm) and 10-inch (254 mm) columbiads * 8-inch, 10-inch, 15-inch (381 mm) and 20-inch (508 mm) Rodman guns (a type of columbiad) * Rifled weapons:Ripley, pp. 109-136 * Rifled and sometimes banded variants of smoothbore guns ranging from 24-pounder (5.82-inch) to 10-inch caliber; one Union rifling system was called the James rifle * 6.4-inch (100-pdr), 8-inch (200-pdr), and 10-inch (300-pdr) Parrott rifles * 6.4-inch and 7-inch (178 mm) Brooke rifles (Confederate made) Post Civil War to the creation of the Coast Artillery Corps After the war, construction for several new Third System forts began in New England. These were to be built of stone rather than brick, and designed to accommodate the large-bore cannon developed during the war. However, in 1867 money for masonry fortifications was cut off, and the Third System came to a close. The vulnerability of masonry to rifled cannon and large-caliber smoothbore cannon and fewer concerns for invasion led to the construction of well-dispersed masonry-revetted earthen fortifications with brick-lined magazines, often located near Third System forts. These were typically armed with 15-inch Rodman guns and 8-inch converted rifles; in some cases, the forts were also rearmed with these weapons. All of the larger Parrott rifles had burst frequently during the war, so few of these were retained in service after the war. Also during the 1870s, a number of new projects were started to include large caliber mortars and submarine mines. However, the facilities for the mortars and mines were never completed, and funding for the new fortifications was cut off by 1878, leaving much of the program unfinished. By the 1880s most of the earthen fortifications were in disrepair.Berhow 2015, p. 8 Monitors for coast defense , a late 19th- century monitor-style coastal defense ship. Though coastal defense was generally within the purview of the Army, the Navy became more involved in the late 19th century with coastal defense ships, generally called monitors. These monitors were turreted ironclad warships inspired by ; as well as coastal ships which closely followed her design, the term \\"monitor\\" also encompassed more flexible breastwork monitors which had a modest armored superstructure and were thus more seaworthy. These also featured modern rifled breech-loading guns. Monitor-style ships were used extensively in offensive roles during the Civil War, but were impractical for ocean service and offensive action abroad. They were, however, ideally suited for harbor defense with their shallow draft and large guns. Postwar, Civil War-era monitors were dispersed to important harbors, including San Francisco on the west coast. From the 1870s to the 1890s, larger and more powerful breastwork monitors were produced, such as the Amphitrite class, while the ocean-going navy was slow to make the transition to steel hulls and armor plating. An improvement on the monitor concept was the coastal battleship, such as the Indiana class of the 1890s. As a result of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and the acquisition of Hawaii and the Philippines, by 1900 the Navy was committed to ocean-going battleships, and ceased building monitors; however, some of the vessels remained in service up to World War I in combat-prepared roles, and as training or auxiliary vessels thereafter. Coast artillery weapons between the Civil War and Endicott period The Endicott Program was largely implemented 1895‚Äì1905. As Endicott facilities were constructed in each harbor defense area, the previous coastal defenses were usually abandoned. Only widely deployed weapons are listed. The larger Parrott rifles had shown a tendency to burst during the war, so only a few were retained in service after the war, in emplacements that took advantage of their long range. * 10-inch (254 mm) and 15-inch (381 mm) Rodman smoothbore guns * 8-inch (203 mm) Rodman converted rifles (converted from 10-inch Rodman guns) Endicott period 10-inch disappearing gun installation, Fort Casey, Washington state. As early as 1882, the need for heavy fixed artillery for seacoast defense was noted in Chester A. Arthur's Second Annual Message to Congress as follows: Prior efforts at harbor defense construction had ceased in the 1870s. Since that time, the design and construction of heavy ordnance in Europe had advanced rapidly, including the development of superior breech- loading and longer-ranged cannon, making U.S. harbor defenses obsolete. In 1883, the Navy began a new construction program with an emphasis on offensive rather than defensive warships. These factors combined to create a need for improved coastal defense systems. Typical Endicott period 6-inch (152 mm) disappearing rifle at Battery Chamberlin in San Francisco In 1885, President Grover Cleveland appointed a joint Army, Navy, and civilian board, headed by Secretary of War William Crowninshield Endicott, known as the Board of Fortifications. The findings of the board illustrated a grim picture of existing defenses in its 1886 report and recommended a massive $127 million construction program of breech-loading cannons, mortars, floating batteries, and submarine mines for some 29 locations on the U.S. coastline. Most of the board's recommendations were adopted. This led to a large-scale modernization program of harbor and coastal defenses in the United States, especially the construction of modern reinforced concrete fortifications and the installation of large caliber breech-loading artillery and mortar batteries. Typically, Endicott period projects were not fortresses, but a system of well-dispersed emplacements with a few large guns in each location. The structures were usually open-topped concrete walls protected by sloped earthworks. Many of these featured disappearing guns, which sat protected behind the walls, but could be raised to fire. With a few exceptions early in the program, Endicott forts had no significant defenses against a land attack. Controlled mine fields were a critical component of the defense, and smaller guns were also employed to protect the mine fields from minesweeping vessels. An extensive fire control system was developed and provided for the forts of each Artillery District.FM 4-15, Coast Artillery Field Manual - Seacoast Artillery Fire Control and Position Finding, U.S. War Department, 1940, Government Printing Office: Washington, DC. Most of the Endicott fortifications were constructed from 1895 through 1905. As the defenses were constructed, each harbor or river's installations were controlled by Artillery Districts, renamed Coast Defense Commands in 1913 and Harbor Defense Commands in 1925.Fort and Battery list at the Coast Defense Study Group website By the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in April 1898, the Endicott Program had completed only a few batteries at each harbor. Following the explosion and sinking of on 15 February, an Act of Congress of 9 March 1898 authorized the construction of batteries that could be rapidly armed at numerous East Coast locations. It was feared that the Spanish fleet would bombard US ports. Completion of Endicott batteries and refurbishment or redeployment of 1870s batteries were also included. The 1870s-type batteries were armed with Civil War-era Rodman guns and Parrott rifles, along with some new weapons: 21 8-inch M1888 guns (slated for incomplete Endicott forts) on modified 1870s Rodman gun carriages.Berhow 2015, pp. 180‚Äì183 New batteries were also begun for eight 6-inch Armstrong guns and 34 4.72-inch Armstrong guns, purchased from the United Kingdom to provide some modern quick-firing medium-caliber guns, as none of the Endicott Program's 6-inch or 3-inch batteries had been completed. Field artillery, primarily 5-inch siege guns and 7-inch siege howitzers, was also deployed, mostly in Georgia and Florida. Many of these batteries were not completed until 1899, after the war was over, and the 8-inch guns were withdrawn within a few years as modern emplacements for them were completed.Congressional serial set, 1900, Report of the Commission on the Conduct of the War with Spain, Vol. 7, pp. 3778‚Äì3780, Washington: Government Printing OfficeBerhow 2015, pp. 86‚Äì87, 92‚Äì93, 201‚Äì219 1901 reorganization Army leaders realized that heavy fixed artillery required different training programs and tactics than mobile field artillery. Prior to 1901 each of the seven artillery regiments contained both heavy and light artillery batteries. In February 1901, with the Endicott program well under way, the Artillery Corps was divided into two types: field artillery and coast artillery. The previous seven artillery regiments were dissolved, and 30 numbered companies of field artillery (commonly called batteries) and 126 numbered companies of coast artillery (CA) were authorized. 82 existing heavy artillery batteries were designated as coast artillery companies, and 44 new CA companies were created by splitting existing units and filling their ranks with recruits. The company-based organization was for flexibility, as each harbor defense command was differently equipped and a task-based organization was needed. The Coast Artillery would alternate between small unit and regimental organization several times over its history. The head of the Artillery Corps became the Chief of Artillery in the rank of brigadier general with jurisdiction over both types of artillery.Coast Artillery Organization ‚Äì A Brief Overview, Bolling W. Smith & William C. GainesBerhow 2015, pp. 423‚Äì427 =Mine planters= USAMP Major Samuel Ringgold, built 1904, which planted practice groups of mines in the Columbia River during the 1920s. (National Archives and Records Administration) Circa 1901 the Coast Artillery took responsibility for the installation and operation of the controlled mine fields from the Corps of Engineers; these were planted to be under observation, remotely detonated electrically, and protected by fixed guns. With that responsibility the Coast Artillery began to acquire the vessels required to plant and maintain the mine fields and cables connecting the mines to the mine casemate ashore, organized as a \\"Submarine Mine Battery\\" within the coast defense command. The larger vessels, called \\"mine planters\\", were civilian crewed until the creation of the U.S. Army Mine Planter Service (AMPS) and Warrant Officer Corps to provide officers and engineers for these vessels in 1918.Army Warrant Officer History Ft. Miles, Principal Armament - Mine Field The mine component was considered to be among the principal armament of coastal defense works. When the Coast Artillery Corps was disestablished and the artillery branches merged in 1950, some of the mine planter vessels were transferred to the U.S. Navy and redesignated as Auxiliary Minelayers (ACM/MMA).Auxiliary Minelayers at NavSource.org Coast artillery weapons of the Endicott period These weapons were emplaced between 1895 and 1905. Only widely deployed weapons are listed. Most except the mortars, 3-inch guns, and some 6-inch guns were on disappearing carriages, with barbette carriages (also called pedestal carriages) used for the remainder.Berhow 2015, pp. 68‚Äì200 Although some harbor defenses in less-threatened locations were disarmed following World War I (some of these retained minefields), many of these weapons remained in service until superseded by 16-inch guns and scrapped during World War II. * 12-inch gun M1888, M1895, M1900 (305 mm) * 12-inch mortar M1886, M1890 (305 mm) * 10-inch gun M1888, M1895, M1900 (254 mm) * 8-inch gun M1888 (203 mm) * 6-inch gun M1897, M1900, M1903 (152 mm) * 5-inch gun M1897, M1900 (127 mm) * 3-inch gun M1898, M1902, M1903 (76 mm) Taft Board and creation of the Coast Artillery Corps In 1905, after the experiences of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, President Theodore Roosevelt appointed a new fortifications board, under Secretary of War William Howard Taft. They updated some standards and reviewed the progress on the Endicott Board's program. Most of the changes recommended by this board were technical; such as adding more searchlights, electrification (lighting, communications, and projectile handling), and more sophisticated optical aiming techniques. The board also recommended fortifications in territories acquired from Spain: Cuba and the Philippines, as well as Hawaii, and a few other sites. Defenses in Panama were authorized by the Spooner Act of 1902. The Taft Program fortifications differed slightly in battery construction and had fewer numbers of guns at a given location than those of the Endicott Program. Due to the rapid development of dreadnought battleships, a new 14-inch gun was introduced in a few locations and improved models of other weapons were also introduced. By the beginning of World War I, the United States had a coastal defense system that was equal to any other nation. The rapidity of technological advances and changing techniques increasingly separated coastal defenses (heavy) from field artillery (light). Officers were rarely qualified to command both, requiring specialization. As a result, in 1907, Congress split Field Artillery and Coast Artillery into separate branches, creating a separate Coast Artillery Corps (CAC), and authorized an increase in the Coast Artillery Corps to 170 numbered companies. In 1907, the Artillery School at Fort Monroe became the Coast Artillery School, which operated until 1946, and in 1908, the Chief of Artillery became the Chief of Coast Artillery. In an exercise in 1907 at Subic Bay, Philippines, a U.S. Marine battalion of the Advanced Base Force commanded by Major Eli K. Cole emplaced forty-four heavy guns for coast defense in a ten- week period, due to the Eight-eight fleet war scare with Japan.Allan R. Millett, Semper Fidelis: The History of the United States Marine Corps, (New York City, NY: The Free Press, 1991). These guns were operated by the Marines until circa 1910, when the Coast Artillery Corps' modern defenses centered on Fort Wint on Grande Island were completed.Berhow 2015, p. 222 Fort Drum Fort Drum in Manila Bay, Philippines, was a result of the Taft board program One of the most extreme fortresses of the early 20th century was Fort Drum in Manila Bay of the Philippines. Originally a barren rock island, it was leveled by U.S. Army engineers between 1910 and 1914 and then built up with thick layers of steel-reinforced concrete into a massive structure roughly resembling a concrete battleship. It was the only true sea fort of the Endicott and Taft programs. The fort was topped with a pair of armored steel gun turrets, each mounting two M1909 guns; this model was specially designed for Fort Drum and was not deployed elsewhere. Four M1908 guns on M1910 pedestal mounts in casemates were also equipped. Searchlights, anti-aircraft batteries, and a fire direction tower were also mounted on its upper surface. The fortress walls protected extensive ammunition magazines, machine spaces, and living quarters for the 200 man garrison. The extensive level of fortification was not typical of the period, but driven by the exposed location. Although the design predated concerns about defense from air attack, the design proved to be exemplary for that purpose. After the outbreak of war in the Pacific on 7 December 1941, Fort Drum withstood heavy Japanese air and land bombardment as it supported U.S. and Filipino defenders on Bataan and Corregidor until the very end on 6 May 1942. The fortress was among the last U.S. posts to hold out against the Japanese and did not surrender until ordered by superiors after Corregidor had been overrun, but not until the U.S. soldiers had sabotaged the guns and ordnance to prevent use by the Japanese. Ironically, even without the guns, the Japanese in Fort Drum were among the last holdouts when U.S. forces recaptured the Philippines in 1945. Self- propelled torpedoes Mines as we know them today were frequently referred to as torpedoes in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The self-propelled torpedo as we know it was derived from the concept of the mine, with early submarines and torpedo boats evolving as defensive weapons in the 1890s to deliver torpedoes against attacking fleets. During early development, it was not clear whether submarines and torpedo boats would be in the purview of the Army or the Navy, since the Army was responsible for the use and development of stationary minefields and other fixed coastal defenses. As the range and potential uses of submarines and torpedo boats grew, it became more apparent that these were naval vessels, and both surface- and submarine-delivered torpedoes were an important aspect of naval coastal defense strategies. However, self-propelled torpedoes were not included in the Army's coastal defenses. Shore-launched Whitehead compressed air driven torpedoes were the first deployed, in Europe. World War I Submarines and airplanes became more important, with the former being a perceived if not actual threat to U.S. harbors. This concern caused an increase in the use of mines and nets, and demand for superior artillery. However, as the war progressed it became more clear that the enemies did not have the resources to bring the war across the Atlantic, and progress diminished along with concerns. Curiously, despite the rise of air power in World War I, it received little consideration in U.S. coast defense design until the late 1930s, probably due to the emergence of Japanese aircraft carriers as a threat. In response to the rapid improvements in dreadnought battleships, approximately 14 two-gun batteries of 12-inch guns on a new M1917 long-range barbette carriage began construction in 1917, but none were completed until 1920. Due to their experience and training with large guns, the Coast Artillery operated all U.S. Army heavy artillery (155mm gun and up) in World War I, primarily French- and British-made weapons. They also acquired the anti-aircraft mission in that war. A number of 5-inch and 6-inch guns were withdrawn from coast defenses and remounted on wheeled carriages for use on the Western Front, with about 72 6-inch (possibly including some Navy guns) and 26 5-inch guns shipped to France. However, due to the Armistice, none of the units equipped with repurposed coast defense guns completed training in time to see action.US Army Coast Artillery Corps in World War IHandbook of Ordnance Data, November 15, 1918, pp. 86-88* Only a few of the 6-inch guns and none of the 5-inch guns were returned to the coast defenses after the war. Most of the 6-inch guns were stored until remounted in World War II, and the 5-inch guns were declared obsolete and scrapped circa 1920.Williford, pp. 92-99 Railway artillery 8-inch M1888 railway gun with ammunition wagon. A large-scale program to mount 12-inch mortars along with 8-inch, 10-inch, and 12-inch guns and some other weapons as railway artillery was partially implemented during and shortly after World War I, with the weapons withdrawn from less-threatened forts and from spares. A general program to reduce mortars from four per pit to two per pit created a surplus of these weapons. The cramped pits created difficulties in reloading; a two- mortar pit had roughly the same rate of fire as a four-mortar pit. Despite a large-scale effort, of all these weapons only three 8-inch guns were delivered to France before the Armistice, due to shipping priorities. The mortars and 8-inch guns were on trainable mounts, thus were suitable for use as coast defense weapons; the other weapons were returned to the forts after the war. Sources indicated that up to 91 12-inch mortars and 47 8-inch guns were retained as railway coast defense weapons through World War II, with most of the 8-inch guns deployed and almost all of the mortars held in reserve.US Army Railway Artillery in WWIHogg, pp. 139-140 During World War I, the U.S. Navy implemented a more successful program that delivered five 14\\"/50 caliber railway guns to France in time to support the final Allied offensives. However, these weapons' mountings were not suitable for coast defense and they were retired after that war. Coast artillery weapons of the Taft period and World War I A new 14-inch (356 mm) gun and improved versions of some Endicott period weapons were introduced from 1905 to 1918, supplementing rather than replacing the previous weapons. The 14-inch guns were emplaced in the new harbor defenses of Los Angeles, Hawaii, the Panama Canal, and Manila Bay in the Philippines. A one-off 16-inch gun M1895 (406 mm) was also deployed on a disappearing carriage on the Pacific side of the Panama Canal in 1914; this was the first 16-inch gun in U.S. service. Only widely deployed seacoast weapons are included in this list. * 14-inch gun M1907, M1910 (356 mm) * 12-inch mortar M1908, M1912 * 6-inch gun M1905, M1908 Between World War I and World War II 12-inch gun M1895 on long-range barbette carriage M1917. 16-inch gun M1919 at Fort Duvall, Massachusetts, typical of pre-WWII 16-inch installations. Airplanes were a minor but increasingly important factor in World War I, and the threat prompted changes to coastal defenses in the 1920s and 1930s. Demonstrations in the 1920s by U.S. Army General Billy Mitchell showed the vulnerability of warships to air attack; this illustrated the use of aircraft for seacoast defense against ships, but also the vulnerability of defenses against air power. In the isolationist United States, bombers were seen as more of a defense against naval attack than a strategic offensive weapon. However, planes like the Boeing B-17, which evolved as defensive weapons, turned out to have excellent offensive capacity as well. Drawdown and reorganization In the early 1920s several types of weapons, mostly those with only a few deployed, were withdrawn from Coast Artillery service. This was probably to simplify the supply situation. The only widely deployed type withdrawn was the 3-inch M1898 Driggs-Seabury gun with masking parapet (simplified disappearing) mounts, at least 111 of which had been emplaced. The disappearing function had already been disabled due to interfering with aiming the gun, and the weapon had an alarming tendency for the piston rod to break on firing.Berhow 2015, pp. 70‚Äì71, 200‚Äì226 Others included 6-inch Armstrong guns (9 guns), all three types of 4.72-inch Armstrong guns (34 guns), 4-inch/40 caliber Navy Driggs-Schroeder guns (4 guns), and all models of 5-inch guns (52 guns). Twenty-six of the 5-inch guns had been sent to France for use on field carriages.69th Coast Artillery page at CAC WWI History site Additionally, approximately 72 6-inch guns withdrawn from coast defenses for field service were not immediately remounted; these were eventually remounted on long-range carriages in new batteries during World War II. Except in a few cases, none of these weapons were directly replaced.Berhow 2015, pp. 200‚Äì226 On 9 June 1925 the Coast Defense Commands were redesignated as Harbor Defense Commands via a War Department order.Berhow 2015, p. 432 By the end of the 1920s, eight harbor defense commands in less-threatened areas were completely disarmed. These included the Kennebec River, ME, Baltimore, MD, Potomac River, MD and VA, Cape Fear River, NC, Savannah, GA, Tampa Bay, FL, Mobile, AL, and the Mississippi River, LA. It is possible the mine defenses were retained in reserve. Some of these commands were rearmed with \\"Panama mounts\\" for mobile artillery early in World War II. In 1922, 274 Coast Artillery companies were authorized, 188 of which were active. During that year 44 companies were inactivated, but 14 new companies were created for the Philippine Scouts, and a 15th in 1923. The Philippine Scouts, units of mostly Filipino enlisted men and mostly U.S. officers, manned many of the coast defenses in the Philippines and served in other key roles. The General Staff reconfirmed a commitment to artillery and mines as the most practical and cost-effective methods for seacoast defense, as an alternative to a larger Navy or Air Corps. In 1924 the CAC adopted a regimental system, consolidating the companies into 16 Regular Army harbor defense regiments, two Philippine Scouts regiments (one harbor defense, one tractor-drawn), three Regular tractor-drawn regiments, and two Regular railway regiments. These were supplemented by 11 harbor defense and two tractor-drawn regiments of the National Guard, which trained in peacetime for activation in wartime. The total companies authorized remained the same, at 289 with 144 active. There was also a Coast Artillery Reserve of 14 harbor defense regiments, four railway regiments, three tractor-drawn regiments, and 42 anti-aircraft regiments in 8 AA brigades. However, many of the Reserve units had only a small number of personnel assigned, and many were demobilized without activation in 1933 and during World War II, or served in that war with different designations.Berhow 2015, pp. 473‚Äì477Coast Artillery Regiments at CDSGCAC regiments 1-196 at the CDSGNational Guard CAC regiments 197-265 at the CDSGOrganized Reserve and Army of the United States Coast Artillery Regiments at CDSG From 1930 to 1932 the army drafted new defense projects for each harbor. In 1931 it established a Harbor Defense Board to supervise the execution of these projects.Kaufmann & Kaufmann 2004, p. 346 New weapons The rapid evolution of dreadnought battleships between 1905 and 1920 demonstrated the need for improved coast defenses, as most Endicott and Taft period weapons were on short-range mountings and were not large enough to reliably defeat battleship armor. Thirty existing 12-inch M1895 guns were mounted on new long-range M1917 barbette carriages in 16 batteries, including two one-gun batteries in the Philippines. Most of these batteries remained in service through the end of World War II. Other new weapons were deployed, but in limited quantities due to budget constraints. 14-inch M1920 railway guns were added to the harbor defenses of the Panama Canal and Los Angeles, two at each location. The future of U.S. coast defense was foreshadowed with the adoption of 16-inch (406 mm) guns, initially the 16-inch howitzer M1920 (25 calibers long) and 16-inch gun M1919 (50 calibers long). Based on the Coast Artillery's experience operating heavy weapons in World War I, especially the French-made 400 mm (15.75 inch) Mod√®le 1916 railway howitzer, new barbette carriages were designed with an elevation of 65 degrees to allow plunging fire as enemy ships approached.Miller, Vol. II, p. 109Ordnance, pp. 147-149 Four howitzers were deployed at Fort Story, Virginia and seven guns were deployed at four locations near Boston, Long Island, NY, Queens, NY, and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. In 1922, the Washington Naval Treaty caused the U.S. Navy to cancel the battleships and the , surplusing 16-inch/50 caliber Mark II and Mark III barrels. About 70 guns were completed before the treaty went into effect, and the Navy wished to retain most of them for use in future battleships. Initially only 20 guns were transferred to the Army, who built a new version of the M1919 mount for the naval guns. However, only ten of these guns were deployed until 1940, in Pearl Harbor, Panama, and San Francisco. They were known as the 16-inch Navy gun MkIIMI and MkIIIMI in Army service. The 16-inch guns, firing projectiles up to , were much more effective than any previous U.S. coast defense guns.Berhow 2015, pp. 61, 227‚Äì228 Another weapon sparsely deployed in the 1930s would become a bigger part of World War II coast defenses. 8-inch/45 caliber Mark VI naval guns from older battleships scrapped under the Washington Naval Treaty became available, but only six guns were deployed between 1933 and 1938, all in fixed mountings. Up to 32 guns were initially available from the secondary armament of , , , and , of the Virginia- and Connecticut-class battleships. They were known as the 8-inch Navy gun MkVIM3A2 in Army service, and a railway mounting was developed in 1941. The main armament of these ships, the 12\\"/45 caliber Mark 5 gun, was also made available to the Army, but these were never deployed by the United States and at least some were sold to Brazil.Berhow 2015, p. 227‚Äì229 Protection against air attack was slow to evolve. Existing batteries were camouflaged, but if detected, they remained vulnerable to air attack. The first batteries of heavy guns constructed after World War I were, somewhat inexplicably, completely open except for camouflage, but mounted long-range weapons set back from the coast out of direct observation from the sea.Conn, pp. 45-55 However, from the late 1930s (in most cases beginning in 1942) these batteries were mounted under thick concrete casemates covered with vegetation to make them virtually invisible from above and well protected against bombing. Significantly, the Washington Naval Treaty prohibited major improvements to defenses in the Pacific including the Philippines, so the two long-range 12-inch guns at Fort Mills on Corregidor were never casemated (paradoxically, this probably improved their usefulness against the Japanese invasion when it came, as they had large arcs of fire). Another result was that 12 240 mm howitzers being shipped to the Philippines were deployed in Hawaii instead.Berhow 2015, pp. 194‚Äì195 In anticipation of a conflict with Japan, most of the limited funds available between 1933 and 1938 were spent on the Pacific coast, especially as several Japanese aircraft carriers were operational by then. In 1939, the threat of war in Europe prompted larger appropriations and the resumption of work along the Atlantic coast. M1918 on Panama Mount A new weapon adopted by the U.S. during World War I introduced road and cross-country mobility to the Coast Artillery. The 155 mm gun M1918 (6.1 inch), closely derived from the French 155 mm GPF (Grand Puissance Filloux, or high-powered gun designed by Filloux), could be towed behind heavy Holt tractors and deployed to provide some protection for areas not part of existing harbor defenses. Each tractor-drawn regiment was authorized 24 of these weapons. Circular concrete platforms called \\"Panama mounts\\" were constructed in existing and new defenses to improve the utility of these weapons, particularly early in World War II.Berhow 2015, pp. 190‚Äì191 In anticipation of war, additional mines, searchlights, radar, and anti-aircraft guns were installed in 1940 and 1941. However, due to a general shortage, installation of new anti-aircraft guns at harbor defenses was minimal.Conn, p. 47 After the war began, the entire Western Defense Command was placed on high alert, but Japanese attacks, including two submarine deck gun attacks and explosive balloons, caused only minor damage. Anti-submarine nets, naval mines, and controlled mines protected many harbor entrances. Radar and patrol planes could detect enemy vessels at long distances, and aircraft became the first line of defense against intruders. A coast defense exercise conducted in the Harbor Defenses of Long Island Sound in 1930 was notable for including aircraft and submarines (from the nearby Submarine Base New London) in the defensive plan. Observation, bombardment, and pursuit (fighter) aircraft were included. The submarines had a dual reconnaissance and counter-attack mission; it was determined that these missions should be separated in future.\\"Minor Joint Army and Navy Exercises ‚Äì Harbor Defenses of Long Island Sound\\", Coast Artillery Journal, July 1930, vol. 73 no. 1, pp. 18-26 Coast artillery weapons between World War I and World War II The majority of Endicott and Taft period weapons remained in service between the wars. U.S. coast artillery introduced between the wars included: * 16-inch gun M1919 (406 mm) * 16\\"/50 caliber Mark 2 gun (also Mark 3) * 16-inch howitzer M1920 * 14-inch M1920 railway gun (356 mm) * 12-inch gun M1895 on long-range M1917 barbette carriage (305 mm) * 12-inch coast defense mortar (various models) on railway mounting * 8-inch M1888 gun on railway mounting (203 mm) * 8-inch Navy MkVIM3A2 gun (initially on fixed mountings) * 155 mm gun M1918, a tractor-drawn French- designed weapon built for the U.S. Army (6.1 inch) World War II The attack on Pearl Harbor demonstrated the obsolescence of coastal artillery that was not protected against air attack and the inadequacy of pre-war anti-aircraft defenses. However, perhaps if there was no coastal artillery surface raiders would have been bolder. Coastal defense emplacements in the Philippines (the only occasion since the Civil War on which U.S. coast defenses were heavily engaged) and Singapore were locally effective; however, the Japanese simply attacked where there were no defenses and then enveloped the fortifications. Heavily fortified positions such as Japanese Rabaul and Fort Drum in the Philippines demonstrated tactical success amongst strategic failures. Fall of the Philippines The Japanese invaded the Philippines shortly after Pearl Harbor, bringing the Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays into the war along with the other U.S. and Filipino forces in the archipelago. The Japanese initially landed in northern Luzon, far from the defenses of Manila Bay. Although the Coast Artillery did their best, their weapons were poorly positioned against the direction of enemy attacks and vulnerable to air and high-angle artillery attack. Eight 8-inch railway guns had been deployed to the Philippines in 1940, but six were destroyed by air attack while entrained in response to the initial landings, and the other two were placed in fixed mountings on Corregidor and Bataan, but lacked crews and ammunition.The Doomed Philippine Inland Seas Defense ProjectAccount of the 8\\" railway guns in the Philippines, 1940-42 The 14-inch turret guns of Fort Drum and the 12-inch mortars of Battery Way and Battery Geary were probably the most effective coast defense weapons in the Battle of Corregidor, but all but two of the mortars were knocked out before the Japanese landed on the island. The U.S. forces surrendered on 6 May 1942, after destroying their weapons. Modernization The outbreak of war in Europe in September 1939 and the Fall of France in June 1940 greatly accelerated U.S. defense planning and funding. About this time a severe lack of design coordination resulted in the being unable to use the Mark 2 and Mark 3 16-inch guns, and a new gun design was required for them.Friedman, pp. 311-313 With war on the horizon, the Navy released the approximately 50 remaining guns, and on 27 July 1940 the Army's Harbor Defense Board recommended the construction of 27 (eventually 38) 16-inch two-gun batteries to protect strategic points along the U.S. coastline, to be casemated against air attack, as were almost all of the older batteries by this time.Berhow 2015, pp. 176‚Äì177 16-inch casemated gun. 6-inch gun M1905 on shielded barbette carriage at Fort Columbia State Park, Washington state, typical of World War II 6-inch batteries. The 16-inch guns were only the top end of the World War II program, which eventually replaced almost all previous coast defense weapons with newer (or remounted) weapons. Most of the 12-inch long-range batteries were casemated and served through the end of the war. Generally, each harbor defense command was to have two or three 16-inch or 12-inch long-range batteries, plus 6-inch guns on new mountings with protected magazines, and 90 mm Anti Motor Torpedo Boat (AMTB) guns, which were supplemented with 37 mm or 40 mm anti-aircraft guns.Berhow 2015, pp. 80‚Äì81, 256‚Äì258McGovern and Smith, p. 43 In addition to the proposed 38 new 16-inch (406 mm) batteries with a range of , eleven new 8-inch (203 mm) batteries with a range of and 87 new 6-inch (152 mm) batteries on high-angle shielded mountings with a range of were projected.Berhow 2015, pp. 229‚Äì231 All of these batteries had two guns each with heavily protected magazines and plotting rooms and casemated guns (except the 6-inch guns had shielded mountings). Additionally, about 32 8-inch MkVIM3A2 railway guns were deployed. In most cases replacing existing harbor defenses, with wartime changes noted, fortifications were planned for the harbor defenses of: East coast * Portland, Maine * Portsmouth, New Hampshire * Boston, Massachusetts * Cape Cod Canal (16-inch not built) * New Bedford, Massachusetts (no additional heavy guns) * Narragansett Bay * New York City ** Long Island Sound ** Southern New York * Delaware River * Chesapeake Bay * Charleston, South Carolina (16-inch not built) Gulf coast * Key West (no additional heavy guns) * Pensacola, Florida (no additional heavy guns) * Galveston, Texas (no additional heavy guns) West coast * San Diego, California * Los Angeles, California * San Francisco, California * Columbia River (no additional heavy guns) * Puget Sound (no additional heavy guns) * Cape Flattery, Washington * Dutch Harbor, Alaska (biggest guns were 8-inch) * Kodiak, Alaska (biggest guns were 8-inch) * Sitka, Alaska (no heavy guns) * Seward, Alaska (no heavy guns) Other U.S. possessions or overseas * Honolulu * Pearl Harbor * Kaneohe Bay * North Shore of Oahu (biggest guns were 8-inch and 240 mm howitzers) * Balboa, Canal Zone (no additional heavy guns) * Crist√≥bal, Col√≥n (16-inch not built) * San Juan, Puerto Rico * Roosevelt Roads Naval Station (biggest guns were 8-inch) * Trinidad (no heavy guns built) * Jamaica (not built) * Bermuda (biggest guns were 8-inch) * Argentia, Newfoundland (no heavy guns) With CONUS and the Caribbean less threatened as the war progressed, about 21 16-inch gun batteries were completed in 1941-44, but not all of these were armed. Three new 12-inch long-range batteries and five 8-inch batteries (mostly in Alaska) were completed and armed, and about 65 6-inch batteries were completed, but only about 45 of these were armed. Some batteries on Oahu were completed with two 14-inch triple turrets from the sunken and eight 8-inch twin turrets removed from and rather than the designed guns. As the areas of combat became more distant from the U.S. and as naval threats were essentially removed, defending harbors against ships became a low priority, and as the new coast defense batteries were completed, almost all of the older seacoast guns were scrapped to become new weapons. Many soldiers of the Coast Artillery were transferred to field artillery, anti-aircraft, or even infantry duties. When the war ended, it was soon decided that seacoast defense guns were no longer needed, and missiles would eventually fill the role. By 1947, most guns remaining in the seacoast defenses were declared surplus and scrapped, and the last weapons were removed in 1950 when the Coast Artillery was deactivated.Conn, pp. 47-54Lewis 1979, p. 132 Other coast defense operations Two related aspects of seacoast defense in the early part of the war were coastal beach patrols in the continental United States (CONUS) and the maintenance of mobile forces there to respond to potential enemy raids. The Coast Guard began these patrols after Pearl Harbor, and in early 1942 the Eastern and Western Defense Commands were assigned the equivalent of up to eight infantry regimental combat teams each for both beach patrols and mobile response. With a rapidly diminishing threat after 1942, by mid-1943 these forces were cut back significantly, and were mostly demobilized in early 1944.Conn, pp. 100-101, 107-110 On the night of 12 June 1942, a patrolling Coast Guard sailor observed German agents landing from a U-boat near Amagansett, Long Island, New York. Communication difficulties precluded an immediate response, but the four agents were rounded up over the next two weeks, along another four landed near Jacksonville, Florida on 17 June. Capture was made easier when two of the agents in New York decided to defect within a few days. They were tried by a military court-martial, with six of the eight executed; one of the defectors received a life sentence and the other 30 years in prison.Conn, pp. 99-101 155 mm Long Tom gun \\"Scorpion\\" of the 4th Marine Defense Battalion in Barakoma, Solomon Islands. Besides the Coast Artillery, key islands in the Pacific theater were defended by U.S. Marine defense battalions throughout the war. Their most famous engagement was the Battle of Wake Island in December 1941, in which heavy casualties were inflicted on a Japanese invasion force that eventually took the island. The U.S. Navy participated in harbor defense with anti-submarine nets and magnetic indicator loops for detecting submarines;Indicator loops website joint harbor defense command posts and harbor entrance control posts were established at harbor defense commands to coordinate army and navy operations. The 155 mm Long Tom artillery piece, an evolution of the 155 mm GPF concept, was used in island and harbor defense in the Pacific from 1943 by both the Marines and the Army. Seven Army Coast Artillery Groups (155 mm Gun) were activated in May‚ÄìJune 1944 as a result of breaking up the tractor-drawn 155 mm gun regiments, which may have been rearmed with the new weapon. Three were deployed to Okinawa and the Philippines in 1945 while one was activated in Trinidad; the remainder never left CONUS.Stanton, pp. 449-450 Coast artillery weapons during World War II U.S. coast artillery during World War II relied primarily on weapons purchased between the wars or stored since the aftermath of World War I. Essentially all of the Endicott and Taft period weapons were scrapped by late 1944 as new batteries were completed. The weapons deployed during the later part of the war included: * 16-inch gun M1919 (406 mm) * 16\\"/50 caliber Mark 2 gun (also Mark 3) * 16-inch howitzer M1920 * 14-inch M1920 railway gun (356 mm) * 12-inch gun M1895 on long-range M1917 barbette carriage (305 mm) * 12-inch coast defense mortar (various models) on railway mounting (almost all in reserve) * 240 mm howitzer M1918 (9.45 inch) on fixed mountings in Hawaii * 8-inch gun M1888 on railway mounting (203 mm) * 8-inch Navy gun MkVIM3A2 (on railway and fixed mountings) * 7\\"/45 caliber gun (178 mm), ex-Navy guns * 155mm gun M1918, a tractor-drawn French-designed weapon built for the U.S. Army (6.1 inch) * 155 mm Long Tom gun M1/M2 * 6-inch gun M1903 on a new high-angle shielded mounting (also M1905, M1/T2) * 6-inch gun M1900 on pedestal mounting (some retained until after the war) * 6\\"/50 caliber gun, ex-Navy Mark 6 and Mark 8 guns * 5\\"/51 caliber gun (127 mm) Mark 15 (early-war Marine defense battalions) * 4\\"/50 caliber gun (102 mm) Mark 9 * 90 mm gun M1 and M2 (3.5 in) on fixed and towed mounts * 3-inch gun M1903 (76 mm) (some retained until after the war) * 40 mm gun M1 (1.57 in) * 37 mm Gun M1 (1.46 in) Postwar defensive missiles Nike-Ajax missile Nike-Hercules missiles BOMARC missile site A system of 90 mm and 120 mm anti-aircraft guns was deployed around the periphery of CONUS shortly after World War II.Cold War AAA Defenses of New York City at American Forts NetworkUS Army AAA Gun Site Program 1951-59 at Ed-Thelen.org However, it was soon overtaken by technology. Early in the Cold War, the Soviet Union developed long-range bombers which could reach the United States, and soon after exploded their first atomic bomb. Among the most-threatened targets were harbors and naval bases. The mission of the Nike surface-to-air missile program was to act as a \\"last-ditch\\" line of air defense for selected areas. The Nike system would have been used if the Air Force's interceptor aircraft failed. With some anti-ship capability (especially the later nuclear-capable weapons), these were the last fixed-fortification weapons employed in the United States.Morgan & Berhow 2002 Nike sites were built during the 1950s in \\"rings\\" around major urban and industrial areas and key Strategic Air Command bases. The number of sites constructed in each ring varied, depending on many factors. In relatively flat terrain rings usually consisted of four launch sites, as at Washington, D.C. However, due to mountainous terrain, the San Francisco Bay area required twelve launch sites. Due to the short range of the original Nike missile, the Nike Ajax, many bases were located close to the center of the areas they protected. Frequently, they were located within heavily populated areas. By 1960, the longer-range, nuclear-capable Nike Hercules was deployed, with the Air Force's BOMARC missile system following soon after. With the advent of numerous intercontinental ballistic missiles, the Nike and BOMARC systems were considered obsolete by the mid-1960s and the installations were removed in the early 1970s, ending nearly 200 years of American coastal defense.

Education and career Born on December 23, 1806, in Hanover County, Virginia, Brockenbrough attended Winchester Law School, studying under Henry St. George Tucker Sr. Others studying with Tucker at that time included William L. Goggin and Henry A. Wise. He entered private practice in Hanover County until 1834. He served as a commonwealth's attorney for Hanover County. He continued private practice in Rockbridge County, Virginia starting in 1834. He was editor of the Lexington Valley Star in Rockbridge County. In 1837, he published two volumes of reports, containing the decisions of John Marshall's federal circuit court opinions. Federal judicial service Brockenbrough was nominated by President James K. Polk on December 23, 1845, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia vacated by Judge Isaac S. Pennybacker. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on January 14, 1846, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on May 4, 1861, due to his resignation. He was succeeded by Judge John Jay Jackson Jr. Other service Concurrent with his federal judicial service, Brockenbrough was the founder and a Professor of law for Lexington Law School (now the Washington and Lee University School of Law) in Lexington, Virginia from 1849 to 1861. His law students included John J. Davis, John Goode and Robert Murphy Mayo. In his introductory address to the first class of incoming students, Brockenbrough offered this advice: > Sooner or later the occasion will arise when you will appear before the > dread tribunal of the public.

In 1852, Brockenbrough was elected to the board of trustees of what is now Washington and Lee University (then Washington College), which had previously honored him with a Doctor of Laws degree in 1851. Peace conference Along with John Tyler, William C. Rives, James Seddon, and George W. Summers, Brockenbrough represented Virginia at the peace conference of 1861. Later career and death Following his resignation from the federal bench, Brockenbrough was a delegate from Virginia to the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States from 1861 to 1862. He was a Judge of the Confederate District Court for the Western District of Virginia starting in 1862. He was a Professor of law for the Washington College Law School (now the Washington and Lee University School of Law) in Lexington from 1866 to 1873. As Rector of Washington College from 1865 to 1872, he was the one to approach Robert E. Lee with the trustees' proposal to make Lee President of the College. In 1866, Lee as President of Washington College invited Brockenbrough to merge his Lexington Law School with Washington College, and continue to teach as Professor of Law and Equity. In 1870, John Randolph Tucker, son of Henry St. George Tucker Sr., was hired to teach law along with Brockenbrough. Brockenbrough resigned in 1873, in a dispute over salary. He resumed private practice in Lexington from 1873 to 1877. He died on February 20, 1877, in Lexington. Family Brockenbrough was the son of William Brockenbrough and Judith Brockenbrough. His sister was Judith White Brockenbrough McGuire, who wrote Diary of a Southern Refugee, During the War, By a Lady of Virginia. He was a first cousin of William Henry Brockenbrough.

Studios were located in Eagan, Minnesota. The station was known as U100 from August 26, 1974, until September 15, 1976. Currently, 980 AM is home to Christian-formatted KKMS and 101.3 FM is CHR-formatted KDWB. History After two years of wrangling and obtaining start-up funds, WPBC officially signed on the air on October 18, 1949. The station was owned by the People's Broadcasting Company, founded by former WCCO announcer Bill Stewart and his wife Becky Ann. In contrast to WCCO and KSTP, WPBC carried no network programming, and were live and local all day. The station in the early years played a variety of middle of the road pop music and standards, and was even considered an innovator in the concept of singing jingles. The Stewarts took a rather conservative approach in programming the station. They shied away from the likes of Elvis Presley and most early rock and roll music, which they described as \\"junky music with morally degrading lyrics.\\" Their philosophy extended to commercials as well, to the point that they rejected advertising from beer and tobacco companies. Allegedly, the Stewarts would go so far as to use the sharp end of a compass to scratch away the grooves of tracks on albums that didn't meet their standards of \\"nice\\" music, in order to prevent rebellious D.J.s from playing them. As they were limited by their then-daytime only license at 980 AM, they started up WPBC-FM at 101.3 MHz in August 1959, simulcasting the AM station. Advertising sales for the stations paled in comparison to the competition, and managing both stations became a burden for the couple, so the Stewarts sold the station in 1972 to Fairchild Industries for $1.5 million. Fairchild subsequently dismissed the entire staff and overhauled both stations. On November 3, 1972, the AM station was relaunched as WYOO, picking up an oldies format (with rock and roll included). A few days later, WPBC-FM became WRAH and programmed an automated album oriented rock format. When the oldies format of WYOO started to slide in the ratings, more MOR music was added, but ratings slid even further. Fairchild contemplated selling the station. The general manager (Mike Sigelman) and program director (Rob Sherwood) (1974), both hired from established Top 40 station KDWB, felt a major change needed to be made. Super U100 The decision was made to change to a Top 40/hard rock format, in contrast to what they saw as the rigid, bland presentation of other similar stations in town. They kept the WYOO call letters, to avoid the hassle and long process of changing call letters with the FCC. Mike Sigelman (General Mgr) Rob Sherwood (program director) both hired from KDWB, hired Bill Hartman straight out of WMMR at the University of Minnesota to become a full-time promotion director. Robi and Bill would sit in the basement of the radio station playing air checks and other sources of radio information on disk. They both became enamored with an air check album, that contained KFRC the San Francisco \\"powerhouse\\" it was a very high energy top 40 presentation featuring \\"Dr. Don Rose\\" and \\"Ed O'Brien\\" it was on that day, that Rob and Bill decided to emulate KFRC and use the phrase \\"powerhouse\\" with Mike Siegelman's OK, we decided to call the new station \\"Y100\\" Bill Hartman, as promotion director convinced Rob and Mike that it was very important to launch the new station at the Minnesota State fair. Exposing the new format to 1.3 million people that attended the fair for 12 days at the end of August to Labor Day every year. Rob flew to Dallas Texas to supervise cutting new jingles for Y100 at the media \\"jingle\\" production company \\"PAM's\\" Bill Hartman commandeered the U of Minnesota theater production company to help create an exterior fa√ßade that would cover a small trailer to remote broadcast from the state fair. Everything was ready and in place on the first day of the Minnesota State fair ready to go, Rob had the format and jingles ready to go on the air. Unfortunately Mikes Siegelman received a letter of \\"cease and desist\\" from Heftel communications in Miami, Florida, which owned \\"Y100 Miami\\" as management, we were in a state of shock, the decision was made to not launch the station on the first day of the state fair. In the meantime, Rob Sherwood flew to Dallas to recut the jingles. Rob and Hartman decided to use \\"U100\\" because of the dial position on an FM tuner, you barely had to turn the dial to fine-tune between 980 AM. and 101.3 FM...they were within a couple millimeters of being \\"in line\\" on a \\"1970's style AM/FM stereo tuner. Consequently the launch of U100 was delayed three days. As Hartman and a crew worked 24 hours to changed all the logos and artwork on the broadcast trailer. It was a very hectic time for this brand- new, soon to be, record-breaking FM station. People walking by the facility at the Minnesota State Fairgrounds would comment, \\"what is this? U100 \\"the twin cites powerhouse\\" playing top 40 and album rock from the speakers with no one in the booth! Finally, Rob Sherwood arrived back in Minnesota with new jingles for the Twin Cities powerhouse station U100. A lot of people thought it was a broadcast training center like \\"Brown Institute\\" or something...This is the true story of the birth of U100. The entire concept, advertising and promotion was headed and created by Mike Siegelman, Rob Sherwood, and Bill Hartman. The actual graphics and billboards were created by Sid Rich and his advertising agency at the time in 1974... \\"Super U100 the twin Cities powerhouse\\" was the original catch phrase, used on-air and in promotion and advertising! Beginning on August 26, 1974 ...The following information is not correct, regarding the concept- creation and formation of \\"U100\\"...After being rebuffed in their planned use of \\"Y100\\" as the station's moniker, station management went through the alphabet before finally stopping at the letter \\"U\\". They liked the sound of that and \\"U100\\" was born, only later realizing the coincidence of the \\"WYOO\\" call letters and the new branding of \\"U100\\". Another oddity was the placement on the dial. The AM broadcast at 980, and the FM at 101.3. Management reasoned that back then, all radios were analog, and it seemed like the only number shown on that part of the dial was a big \\"100\\", so it was close enough to 980 and 101.3, close enough to \\"100\\" as far as they were concerned. The changeover occurred on August 26, 1974, during a remote broadcast from the Minnesota State Fair. The program director, Rob Sherwood, used this opportunity to abruptly change the format of both stations, debuting the AM and FM simulcast of \\"Super U100\\" with a Joe Cocker song and a two- minute montage of the new stations' new jingles. The new U100 quickly became the topic of conversation throughout the area with its rowdy, outrageous mix of Top 40 and hard rock. With a constant bombardment of loud jingles the jocks would scream \\"YEEEEWWWW ONE HUNDRED!\\" and \\"BOOGIE!\\" when they weren't giving the time, temperature (\\"it's seventy-two degrees in Frriiidleeeeey!\\") or bad jokes. \\"Right on Super U\\" became a catch phrase on the station and amongst its fans. The presentation was tight, fast-paced and very up-front. During the next two years, U100 quickly became the most talked-about and Number one rated radio station in town. Competition was fierce with 5 rock radio stations at the time, and compared to U100, WDGY, KDWB and KSTP seemed a bit tame in their original on-air presentation, and staff was Rob Sherwood, Jeff \\"Mother\\"Robins, Benny Blore (Bill Hartman) Jerry Brook, \\"U.S. Steele\\" (Steve Gibbons) Art Snow (The all night snowman) Scott Cannon, \\"the Tall\\" (Brother Bob) Robert Hall\\", Doug McKinnon, (Captain Billy in the morning) Michael J. \\"Donuts\\" Douglas (news man)... Then, later on, the following talent also became a part of the station...Jerry St James, Mesa Kincaid, Patrick M. \\"Cookin\\" McKay, Chucker Morgan, Jo Jo Gunns, and more on U100. As an added advantage, U100 was the first Twin Cities top 40 station to broadcast simulcast on the FM dial in stereo (in addition to 980 AM). U100 sold and broken up In early 1976, Fairchild Industries decided to put both stations on the market. The owner of easy listening FM station WAYL was interested in the AM operation, to simulcast WAYL's signal and expand coverage in parts of the metro area. Since one company could not own more than one AM or more than one FM station in the same market at the time, they needed to find a buyer for the FM station, and sought out the owners of various AM stations in the area. Doubleday Broadcasting, owner of KDWB, wasn't actively seeking an FM station at the time but offered to buy 101.3 FM in February 1976 after they were offered a rather generous deal for $750,000 that included WYOO-FM and the building in Eagan that housed both stations. KDWB's general manager at the time, Gary Stevens, claimed that they did not buy WYOO-FM to shut down a competitor, but rather to take advantage of what they saw as a good deal. U100 signed off for the last time at midnight on Wednesday September 15, 1976, and KDWB morning personality True Don Bleu launched the new KDWB-FM simulcast the following morning at 6 AM. The first song was Bad Blood by Neil Sedaka. The following Monday, 980 AM came back on the air as WAYL. WYOO today The WYOO call sign has resided on an FM talk station in Panama City, Florida since 1993. See also *KKMS (AM) *KDWB *KXXR External links *Right on Super U!

The signature occurred in a patrician villa, owned by the Lanza family (\\"Casalanza\\" meaning \\"Lanza House\\" in Italian), in what is now the commune of Pastorano, Campania, southern Italy. Following the decisive defeat at the Battle of Tolentino and the Battle of San Germano, the Napoleonic King of Naples, Joachim Murat, had fled to Corsica and General Michele Carascosa, who was now the head of the Neapolitan army following Murat's flight, sued for peace. The treaty was signed by Pietro Colletta (who was acting as plenipotentiary to Michele Carascosa), Adam Albert von Neipperg (who was acting as plenipotentiary to the commander-in-chief of the Austrian forces, Frederick Bianchi), and Lord Burghersh (the English minister plenipotentiary in Florence). The terms of the treaty were quite lenient on the defeated Neapolitans. All the Neapolitan generals were allowed to keep their rank and the borders of the Kingdom of Naples remained unchanged. The treaty merely called for the return of the pre- Napoleonic King Ferdinand IV of Naples and Sicily to the Neapolitan throne, the return of all prisoners of war and for all the Neapolitan garrisons to lay down their arms, with the exception of Ancona, Pescara and Gaeta. These three cities were all being blockaded by an Anglo-Austrian fleet and were out of General Carascosa's control. These three garrisons eventually surrendered, although the Siege of Gaeta would last till August, long after Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Waterloo.

(Bull) Headley (Heed-Lee) located in Leon County, Florida, United States. History Originally a large part of Water Oak Plantation owned by Frances C. Griscom, Headley purchased all but a few hundred acres from Griscom in 1951. He named it Bull Run Plantation. Julian C.(Bull) Headley was a lumberman by career. Starting with the land itself, Headley reduced most of the trees converting the land to cattle range where he ran about 500 head of beef cattle and used the Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog for herding. The house Upon purchasing the property, Headley found that the old Griscom home was too small and in need of extensive repairs. Headley had the house razed and built a new brick mansion overlooking Lake Iamonia. He brought in pecan and other expensive wood for the home's interior paneling and finish work. The roof was over-engineered using rafters which measured by and set every . Headley also built a large bathhouse and swimming pool reportedly to cost $25,000. He also had polar bear rugs. The bricks from Griscom's home were used along with bricks he brought in from North Carolina to create terraces and walkways. Grounds Headley was a sportsman enjoying hunting and sports fishing. He preserved large areas of his property especially for hunting and fishing. He constructed a dam to slow a small stream that flowed south to north to create the chain of lakes now running through Golden Eagle Country Club. Headley then created his own duck lake called Lake Monkey Business. Sale In 1964 Headley became attracted to the prospects in Central America, specifically its timber resources. Headley sold his property to a syndicate of sportsmen and left for British Honduras (Belize). The syndicate was interested in a recreational preserve. One of the members was Gillis Long, a Congressman from Louisiana and assistant secretary of the Office of Economic Opportunity under President Lyndon Johnson. Kinhega Lodge was established and a Donald Davis was put in charge of developing fields and ponds and supervise hunting and fishing. Plans for a golf course and landing strip overextended the resources of the syndicate causing its end.

The $20 note was introduced on 10 July 1967, replacing the New Zealand ten-pound note. Design=First issue (1967 to 1981) The first $20 notes featured Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the obverse, with a window watermark panel showing a portrait of Captain James Cook. The obverse featured a kereru (Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae) and a miro (Prumnopitys ferruginea). Second issue (1982 to 1990) This issue's design was very similar to the first issue, with the most obvious difference being the updated portrait of Queen Elizabeth II. There is also some new color changes. Third issue (1990 to 1999) In 1990, all of New Zealand's notes were redesigned. The new $20 note featured Queen Elizabeth II and the New Zealand Parliament Buildings on the obverse, while the reverse featured a New Zealand Alpine scene, containing a kƒÅrearea (Falco novaeseelandiae), Marlborough rock daisy (Pachystegia insignis), Flowering red tussock (Chionchloa rubra) and Mount Tapuaenuku. This note is different from the fourth series because it was issued in cotton not polymer. Fourth issue (1999 to 2016) In 1999, the material used to make twenty dollar notes was changed to polymer. The basic design of the note remained unchanged, although new anti-counterfeiting measures such as transparent sections of the note were added, and the metallic stripe removed. The 20 has the New Zealand Parliament Buildings on it, which is to the left of Elizabeth II, the portrait was taken in 1986. On the back is the kƒÅrearea. The scene in the background is Mount Tapuaenuku, the highest peak on the South Island's Inland Kaikoura range, standing at 2,885 Meters (9,465 ft) in height. Fifth issue (2016 to present) The note was made brighter.https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/notes-and- coins/notes/banknotes-in-circulation The $20 note is by far the most commonly used denomination in New Zealand. It is the main note dispensed from Automatic Teller Machines and probably 90% of all notes from ATMs are $20s. Only a few ATMs dispense $10 notes (and some now, $50s). The note is accepted everywhere and seldom attracts the same suspicion from shop keepers that the $50 and $100 note does. Gaming machines also have the $20 as their top accepted note and many people will often avoid ATMs that insist on dispensing $50s as they find the larger note inconvenient. The $20 is also a convenient note as a gift to children and for small purchases like fast food and public transport journeys. The $20 note is the most common note in circulation. As of March 2019, there were an estimated 59.7 million $20 notes were in circulation worth, representing 31.6% of all dollar notes (29.4% including the now-demonetised $1 and $2 notes).

Ducal Palace of Lerma, in the Burguese municipality of Lerma. Palacio de Santa Cruz (Madrid). Colegiata de San Pedro (Lerma, province of Burgos). Parish and Covent of San Juan Bautista, Coyoac√°n in Mexico City, built between 1560-1804, is an example of the Herrerian architecture in the Americas. The Herrerian style ( or arquitectura herreriana) of architecture was developed in Spain during the last third of the 16th century under the reign of Philip II (1556‚Äì1598), and continued in force in the 17th century, but transformed by the Baroque style of the time. It corresponds to the third and final stage of the Spanish Renaissance architecture, which evolved into a progressive purification ornamental, from the initial Plateresque to classical Purism of the second third of the 16th century and total nudity decorative that introduced the Herrerian style. It originated with the construction of the Monastery of El Escorial (San Lorenzo de El Escorial, Community of Madrid) and, more specifically, with the reorganization of the project made by Cantabrian architect Juan de Herrera (1530‚Äì1597), after the death of Juan Bautista de Toledo (1515‚Äì1567), author of the first design. Its main representatives are the mentioned Herrera, who the style owes its name, and Francisco de Mora (1553‚Äì1610), disciple of the anterior and architect of the Ducal Palace of Lerma (Lerma, Province of Burgos), other key works of Herrerian architecture.  Features  The Herrerian architecture, or Herrerian style is characterized by its geometric rigor, the mathematical relation between the various architectural features, the clean volumes, the dominance of the wall over the span and the almost total absence of decoration, which is why in time was called estilo desornamentado (\\"unornamented style). Is also known as Escorial style, referring to the building that serves as best example for the architectural style. The Herrerian buildings are noted for its severe horizontality, achieved through the balance of forms, preferably cubic, which are arranged symmetrically in the structure. Usually have wooden roofs covered with slate in the exterior and side towers, with pointed pyramidal spires, called Madridian spires, which introduce an element of verticality, while helping to reinforce the sense of grandeur and elevation. At other cases, not looking both the horizontal and the bulkiness, which is reached through the geometrical design of the various architectural elements. This is the case of the model used in the construction of parish churches, with great facades, quadrangular towers and heavy buttresses. It is, in most cases, works of great size, imposing in its environment and impress with its austere and monumental air. In regard to decorative applications, these reduce the use of basic geometric shapes such as spheres and pyramids. From a sociological standpoint, this sobriety is a response to Protestantism, in line with the guidelines set by the Council of Trent (1545‚Äì1563).  Historical development  The Herrerian style was the official architecture of the Habsburgs, from the reign of Philip II. The sociopolitical impact meant the construction of the Monastery of El Escorial (1563‚Äì1584) facilitated its expansion. To this contributed also the fact that Juan de Herrera was appointed in 1579 Inspector of Monuments of the Crown. The style spread first through the comarcas of Madrid of the Sierra de Guadarrama, located within the catchment area of the Monastery of El Escorial, through two ways: works directly funded by the Royal Family and those promoted by the Guadarraman municipalities. The first category covers infrastructure such as the Puente Nuevo, in Galapagar, and buildings for private use by Philip II, as the Casa Veleta, also in the same town, and the Real Aposento de Torrelodones (both disappeared) were built for comfort the movements of the King from Madrid to El Escorial. In El Escorial, the Crown encouraged the development of various urban planning and the construction of the Church of San Bernab√©, by Francisco de Mora, one of the contributors to Herrera in the works of the Royal Monastery. The Royal Family also approved the granting of benefits to those municipalities to proceed with the renovation of its main public and religious buildings. The result of this measure is the currently Herrerian aspect of the parish churches of Valdemorillo and Navalagamella, both of medieval origin. The Herrerian style quickly spread throughout Spain and America. Some representative works are the Cathedral of Valladolid and the Puente de Segovia (Madrid), both designed by Juan de Herrera; the church of the Monasterio de Ucl√©s (Ucl√©s, Cuenca Province), by Francisco de Mora; the Church of San Sebasti√°n (Villacast√≠n, Segovia Province), attributed to Rodrigo Gil de Honta√±√≥n; the Colegiata de San Luis (Villagarc√≠a de Campos, Valladolid Province), by the same author; and the College of Our Lady of Antigua (Monforte de Lemos, Lugo Province) by Sim√≥n de Monasterio. Special mention deserves the Ducal Palace of Lerma (Burgos Province), by Francisco de Mora that began in 1601. Led to the adoption of the emerging Herrerian style by the emerging Baroque architecture trends of the time and the establishment of a palatial architecture model, which was repeated throughout the 17th century. Most civic buildings erected in Madrid during the reign of Philip III and Philip IV continued the architectural guidelines of that palace. This is the case of the Palace of the Councils, the Santa Cruz Palace and the Casa de la Villa, all of Baroque bill, but with notable Herrerian reminiscent. The influence of Herrerian style is also visible in the expansion that, separately, had its distinctive spire pyramidal or \\"madrilian spire\\", with slate roofs. This item was adopted by many constructions after to 16th and 17th century, mainly in the bell towers and domes of the churches, and in many civil constructions. The 18th and 19th century meant the decline of this architectural movement. In the 20th century came to pick up, during the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. The Plaza de la Moncloa, in Madrid, chaired by Air Force headquarters, among many large constructions of the time, symbolizes the resurgence of Herrerian architecture.

Several of his most memorable matches include top Canadian independent wrestlers such as \\"Rocket\\" Randy Tyler, Dr. Luther, Chance Beckett, \\"Tornado\\" Tony Kozina, \\"Fallen Angel\\" Christopher Daniels, Bryan Danielson, Bryan Alvarez, Asian Cougar and Juggernaut. In addition to ECCW, he competed for Portland Wrestling, Can Am Wrestling Federation, Stampede Wrestling, Prairie Wrestling Alliance, Pacific Northwest Championship Wrestling, Canadian All Pro Wrestling, W.H.I.P. Wrestling, Bad Boys of Wrestling, and the Continental Association of Wrestling. Career=Early life and career Firestorm first became involved in wrestling as a writer for the magazine Northwest Wrestler, which covered wrestling in Oregon, Washington State, and British Columbia. He later went on to become editor of the publication. Some time later, Firestorm and fellow Northwest Wrestler staff member James Olson were hired by West Coast Championship Wrestling to take over publishing their official event program. In addition, Firestorm worked as timekeeper, ring announcer, ring crew, and videographer at different periods. He released two videotape during this time, WCCW Mat Mayhem, and Ring Wars. Trained for the ring primarily by WCCW (and later ECCW) wrestler/promoter \\"Gorgeous\\" Michelle Starr, he also trained for three months with former WWE Women's Champion Velvet McIntyre. When a wrestler failed to appear for an ECCW (Extreme Canadian Championship Wrestling) tour of Vancouver Island in March 1996, Firestorm was called into action under the masked guise of El Antorcha. He won his debut match (a steel cage match) against Skull Manson in Port Alberni, BC. Extreme Canadian Championship Wrestling With about a year of experience, El Antorcha won a Doomsday Battle Royal to claim the vacant ECCW Heavyweight Title. Firestorm suffered several injuries in the bout (a battle royal with weapons), which was a major factor in his loss of the title in April 1997. Firestorm assisted Michelle Starr with training several wrestlers in 1997 after the opening of the ECCW Pro Wrestling School. He teamed with one of the first graduates, Strife, to form Generation X. They challenged for the ECCW tag team titles on several occasions. During 1998, Firestorm traded the ECCW Junior Heavyweight title back and forth several times with \\"Tornado\\" Tony Kozina. He also held the NWA Pacific Northwest Junior Heavyweight title several times after ECCW joined the National Wrestling Alliance. In 1999, he unified the two junior titles, winning a one-night tournament. In the finals, he defeated Disco Fury and Chance Beckett in a Triple Threat Ladder Match. After losing the title, he went on to capture the prestigious NWA Canadian Junior Heavyweight title twice, defeating The Black Dragon both times. In 2000, El Antorcha's feud with Chance Beckett came to a head, with heel ECCW Commissioner and NWA representative Dave Republic siding with Beckett. Republic would continuously allow outside interference on the behalf of Beckett until Torch lost the Pacific Northwest Junior Heavyweight Title to Beckett. When the behaviour continued during rematches, Republic forced the mask to be put up in order to grant another rematch. Firestorm again lost due to outside interference and was forced to unmask. Later that same evening, Beckett returned to the ring to gloat over winning the match, keeping his title and taking the mask. Firestorm stormed the ring and beat down Beckett until he agreed to one more rematch. A furious Dave Republic ordered the rematch would be a ladder match. Firestorm, wrestling for the first time unmasked as Adam Firestorm, defeated Beckett in the ladder match to regain his championship. Republic forced Firestorm to face his first challenger, Disco Fury, just moments after the ladder match ended. Disco capitalized on a weakened Firestorm to handily win the belt. Alliance with Ladies Choice Firestorm briefly competed as a heel during 2003. Turning on tag team partners Scotty Mac and Ja Jakobe, Firestorm aligned himself with Aaron Idol, Sweet Daddy, and Chance Beckett. A full-time team with Beckett never materialized, so Firestorm formed a team with the hated Ladies Choice, feuding with Scotty Mac and various partners. During the Summer of 2003, Firestorm and Ladies Choice faced Scotty Mac and MTV Canada host Brian Adler in a nationally televised bout on the program MTV Select. Firestorm's run as a heel came to an end following a loss against Rocky Della Serra in New Westminster, BC in December 2003. Firestorm announced he would be leaving ECCW and the Northwest, and thanked the fans. Partner Ladies Choice took issue with this and attacked Firestorm before Della Serra returned to help Firestorm fight him off. Elbow injury While wrestling on a Stampede Wrestling event in Cochrane, Alberta in May 2005, Firestorm suffered a serious elbow injury. The injury came during a dive outside the ring against \\"Livewire\\" Matt Richards. While originally diagnosed by emergency department doctors at Foothills Hospital in Calgary as a case of tendinitis, X-rays would show a crack in the elbow 85% through the bone. Firestorm was told to rest the arm and it would heal within eight weeks. One year later, after swelling from the elbow caused tendon and ligaments in the arm to atrophy (causing a loss in range of motion), X-rays at the time revealed the crack was still present. Surgery options were few, with the best offering a 2% R.O.M. improvement, while carrying a risk of a loss of an additional 15%. Firestorm chose not to have the procedure. 2007‚Äì2009 Firestorm's wrestling appearances (all non-physical) were few after his injury. In September 2007, El Antorcha made a surprise return, appearing in the corner of El Phantasmo at an All Star Wrestling event in Comox, BC. El Antorcha also appeared on a December 2007 wrestling event in Victoria, BC. He instead focused on video production (he attended film school at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology in Calgary, Alberta), and assisting various promoters and wrestlers with promotional materials and websites. Firestorm lived in Victoria, BC with his wife and son, where he operated his own video production company, Firestorm Video Production. He also co-hosted the Ringside Live internet radio show with Ian Hamilton every Friday night. In September 2009 Dykes was severely injured when a van he was a passenger in collided with a 600 lb elk on Vancouver Island. As he later wrote in his blog, \\"[We] are all very lucky. And I can joke that I took an elk's butt to the face and lived to talk about [it]... even perhaps comment on any recent meals he had eaten. When you look at what was left of the van, you can see how very close I came to being killed.\\" Dykes died on November 5, 2009, from an apparent suicide due to his suffering from depression.

He is the most accomplished member of the only three- generation umpiring family in major league history; his father Ed was an American League umpire from 1954 to 1970, and his son Brian was a major league umpire from 1999 to 2012. Paul Runge wore number 17 on his jacket and shirt sleeve for most of his 25 year umpiring career. Paul Runge graduated from Arizona State University,National League Green Book (1997), p. 44. where he lettered in baseball, and after a brief minor league playing career in the farm systems of the Houston Colt .45s and Los Angeles Angels, he became an NL umpire after working in the California League (1965‚Äì66), Eastern League (1967) and Pacific Coast League (1968‚Äì73). He was the first son of a former major league umpire to reach the majors himself. He officiated in four World Series (1979, 1984, 1989, 1993), and in the All-Star Games of 1978, 1986 and 1994, working behind the plate for the last contest. He tied Doug Harvey's major league record by umpiring in nine League Championship Series - 1977, 1981, 1982, 1984 (Game 5 only), 1985, 1988, 1990, 1995 and 1996 - serving as crew chief in 1995 and 1996. The record was also tied by Bruce Froemming in 1997, and Froemming broke it upon umpiring in his 10th NLCS in 2000. Runge also worked in the single-game playoff to decide the NL's Western Division championship in 1980. Runge was behind the plate when Charlie Lea of the Montreal Expos pitched a 4-0 no-hitter on May 10, 1981; it was the first no- hitter pitched at Olympic Stadium. He was umpiring at first base on September 25, 1986 when Mike Scott pitched a no-hitter to clinch the NL West title for the Houston Astros. He also officiated on September 28, 1988 when Orel Hershiser broke the Major League record for consecutive scoreless innings pitched. During Game 5 of the 1984 World Series, Runge was the home plate umpire when Kirk Gibson hit a home run where his Detroit Tigers would win that year's World Series over the San Diego Padres. Runge, who resided in the San Diego area throughout his career, became the NL's director of umpires in both 1998 and 1999 before Major League Baseball reorganized its umpiring staffs.

State when we defeated them twice.\\" He was a consensus All-Southern choice each year he played. Lawrence Perry selected Wycoff first-team All-American in 1924. Morgan Blake, sports writer for the Atlanta Journal, said of an all-time All-Southern list: \\"It seems to us that one name is left out in this collection, who may have been the best all-around player the South has had. \\"We have reference to Doug Wycoff of Tech who, for three straight years, was practically the unanimous all-Southern football choice, despite the fact that Georgia Tech had very lean years during his period of play at this institution. If Wycoff had been flanked by such a pair of halfbacks as Red Barron and Buck Flowers, or Thomason and Mizell while he was with the Jackets, he would have been an all-American. As it was he had to carry all of the offensive load and on the defense he was a wheelhorse. He was a great punter and passer.

Inter-county Delea first came to prominence on the inter-county scene in the mid-1920s. He won his first Munster title as a substitute in 1926. Delea later lined out in his first All-Ireland decider as snow covered Croke Park for an October final. Kilkenny provided the opposition on that occasion, however, Cork were victorious giving Delea his first All- Ireland medal.

Once again, he lined out in that year's All-Ireland final where Galway lined out as well. Once again, it was the men from the west who lost out as Delea claimed a third All-Ireland title. Cork lost their provincial crown in 1930, however, the team bounced back in 1931 with Delea winning a fifth Munster medal. A fifth All-Ireland final appearance later followed with Kilkenny providing the opposition. The final went to two replays, with Delea scoring the equalising goal in the second game. Cork eventually triumphed in the third game with Delea picking up his fourth All-Ireland medal. The Cork team went into decline following this game and Delea later retired from inter- county hurling. Provincial Delea also won a Railway Cup inter-provincial title with Munster in 1931. Personal life and death Delea was born in Blackrock, Cork, the second of five children born to James and Mary (n√©e Linehan). His father, a brewery worker, won All-Ireland Championships with Cork as a member of their first three-in-a-row team between 1892 and 1894.

In 1995, bassist Adam Loewy and drummer Mathew McCauley joined the band to flesh out the sound. The self-titled Gumwrapper Curb demo EP was released in 1996 and the band began playing shows. Women and success The band began earning a name for themselves in Florida and other southern states. Their 1997 release Women featured the song \\"You're the Girl,\\" which WJRR and other local radio stations began playing. The band then began getting booked on shows with the likes of Matchbox 20, Creed, Seven Mary Three, The Nixons, and Sister Hazel. The band was also featured on several volumes of the Axis music compilations. The success of the Women CD, combined with the success of the band's live shows, got them signed to a major label. The band, now with drummer Brett Crook, signed to Universal Records. However, Universal and the band didn't see eye to eye on what their sound should be. They ended up leaving Universal and signing with Atlantic Records, through its smaller branch Breaking, which was started by members of Hootie & The Blowfish. The band changed their name to Virginwool, taking the name from the title of a song from the Women CD. The band began recording with Brad Wood and eventually released their debut full length Open Heart Surgery on August 8, 2000.

This was later highlighted by an extended tour with Hootie & the Blowfish and live appearance on The Oxygen Channel. \\"I Think Her Mother Loves Me\\" and \\"Better for You\\" were released as singles from Open Heart Surgery. End of the band After touring behind Open Heart Surgery, the band members decided to go their own ways. Adam Loewy played with several different musicians, including Peter Searcy. Brett Crook went on to tour and record with Florida-based soul band The Legendary JC's, Mississippi Blues Artist and Grammy nominated Cedric Burnside, Bill 'SauceBoss' Wharton and more. Mathew McCauley, the band's original drummer, went on to serve as a musician in the Army before training and working as a military clinical psychologist.

Career Considered an early Angolan nationalist and assimilado, Pereira took advantage of a relatively free press in Angola from 1870-1890 to question Portuguese obligations and control over Angola. He addressed topics such as the export of black Angolans to S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipean plantations, coerced labor within the colony, inefficiency, corruption and racial discrimination, amongst many others. Writing for the literate Portuguese settler population of Angola, Pereira wrote mostly in the Portuguese language. Pereira lost his job and was put on trial when, in 1890, he suggested that the British should take over colonial administration of the colony due to Portuguese incompetence. He died 16 months later in May 1891 of natural causes.

Formerly used for the whole of the Iberian peninsula, the term is now usually restricted, at least in architecture, to the south, with Repoblaci√≥n art and architecture used for the north. Art The Mozarabic communities maintained some of the Visigothic churches that were older than the Arab occupation for the practice of their religious rites and were rarely able to build new ones, because, even though a certain religious tolerance existed, the authorizations for building new churches were very limited. When permitted, new churches were always in rural areas or in the cities' suburbs, and of modest size. When Christian kingdoms of the north of the peninsula initiated an expansion (which sometimes including the expulsion of native Muslim population in the conquered lands), some Mozarabs opted to emigrate towards these territories where they were offered land. Their Hispano- Visigothic culture had been mixing with the Muslim and it is to be supposed that this contributed to the emerging cultures of the new Christian kingdoms in all fields. However it is unlikely that they were responsible for all of the artistic innovations brought to maturity in the kingdoms of the north during the 10th century. Concluding the first phase of the artistic process that is generally comprised in the ample concept of \\"Pre-Romanesque\\" and corresponding with Hispano-Visigothic art; another stylistic current was initiated in Iberia, inheriting many aspects of the earlier style and known as \\"Asturian art\\". This has been identified with the artistic creations that were being produced during the 9th century in the so-called \\"nucleus of resistance\\", specifically in the territories that comprised the kingdom of Asturias. However the artistic activity, in general (and architecture especially) was not limited to this area or this century, it encompassed all the northern peninsula and had continuity during the next century. The displacement of the Christian-Muslim border to the Douro basin allowed the construction of new temples (works on which all the artistic capacity available was concentrated) in demand of the necessities of re-settling. The now prosperous Northern kingdoms were in a condition to undertake that task (as they had already been doing), without depending on hypothetical contributions of the incorporated Mozarabs, so it cannot be assumed that all the religious buildings and all the artistic creations are owed to these mainly rural immigrants who arrived with limitation of means and resources. After the publication in 1897 of the well-informed work in four volumes History of the Mozarabs of Spain (Historia de los moz√°rabes de Espa√±a) by Francisco Javier Simonet, the professor and investigator Manuel G√≥mez Moreno published 20 years later (1917) a monograph about The Mozarabic Churches. It is here where the Mozarabic character is applied to the churches constructed in Christian territory from the end of the 9th century until the beginning of the 11th, and where the term \\"Mozarabic\\" is instituted to designate this architectural form and all of the related art. The denomination had success in becoming one that has been commonly used, although other scholars claimed the interpretation lacked rigour. The Mozarabic character of the temples that G√≥mez Moreno referred to in his book has been questioned by modern historiography, including by the not so modern. Already Jos√© Cam√≥n Aznar in his Spanish Architecture of the 10th Century (Arquitectura espa√±ola del siglo X) considered himself against such an interpretation, after him Isidro Bango Torviso and many others, to the point that the present tendency shows a trend towards the abandoning of \\"Mozarabic Art\\" denomination altogether and its substitution by \\"Repoblaci√≥n art and architecture to refer to the period, especially in the north of Spain. Literature Beatus of Facundus: Judgment of Babylon The principal exponent is religious literature: Mozarabic missals, antiphoneries and prayerbooks, created in the scriptorium of the monasteries. Examples of quality and originality of the miniatures and illuminated manuscripts are the Commentarium in Apocalypsin (Commentary on the Apocalypse) from Beatus of Li√©bana, Beatus of Facundus or Beatus of T√°bara. Or antiphonaries like the Mozarabic Antiphonary of the Cathedral of Le√≥n (Antifonario moz√°rabe de la Catedral de Le√≥n). Toledo and C√≥rdoba were the most important Mozarabic centers. From C√≥rdoba was the abbot Speraindeo, who wrote an Apologetic against Muhammad. And very important for the history of philosophy studies is the Apologetic of the abbot Sans√≥n (864). Architecture The principal characteristics that define the Mozarabic architecture are the following: * A great command of the technique in construction, employing principally ashlar by length and width. * Absence or sobriety of exterior decoration. * Diversity in the floor plans, certainly the majority stand out by the small proportions and discontinuous spaces covered by cupolas (groined, segmented, ribbed of horseshoe transept, etc.). * Use of the horseshoe arch, a very tight arch with the slope being two-thirds of the radius. * Use of the alfiz. * Use of the column as support, crowned by a Corinthian capital decorated with very stylized vegetal elements. * The eaves extend outwards and rest on top of corbels of lobes. The Mozarabic architecture interpreted strictly in its definition, that is to say, that the Mozarabs in Muslim Iberia brought to completion, would be reduced to two examples: * The Church of Bobastro: rock temple located in the place known as Mesas de Villaverde, in Ardales (M√°laga), of which only some ruins remain. * The Church of Santa Mar√≠a de Melque: located in proximity to La Puebla de Montalb√°n (Toledo). With respect to this temple, its stylistic parentage is in doubt, because it shares Visigothic features with other more proper Mozarabic features, nor its date being clear. Nevertheless, at a popular level, including in encyclopedias and books, the denomination that has kept prevailing is Mozarabic Art and among the most important that can be cited in Spain and Portugal, the following can be counted as Mozarabic: * In Castile and Le√≥n: ::- San Miguel de Escalada (Le√≥n) ::- Santiago de Pe√±alba (Le√≥n) ::- Santo Tom√°s de las Ollas (Le√≥n) ::- San Baudelio de Berlanga (Soria) ::- San Cebri√°n de Mazote (Valladolid) ::- Santa Mar√≠a de Wamba (Valladolid) ::- San Salvador de Tabara (Zamora) * In Cantabria: ::- Santa Mar√≠a de Lebe√±a (Cantabria) * In Arag√≥n: ::- San Juan de la Pe√±a (Huesca) ::- Church of the Serrablo (Huesca), as the Church of San Juan de Busa * In La Rioja ::- San Mill√°n de Suso (San Mill√°n de la Cogolla) * In Catalonia: ::- Sant Quirze de Pedret (Barcelona) ::- Santa Maria de Marquet (Barcelona) ::- Church of Sant Crist√≤fol (Barcelona), in the municipality of Vilassar de Mar, at 30 km from Barcelona ::- Sant Juli√† de Boada (Girona), located in the small hamlet of the same name, in the comarca of Baix Empord√† (Girona) ::- Santa Maria de Matadars (Barcelona), in the municipality of El Pont de Vilomara i Rocafort * In Galicia: ::- San Miguel de Celanova (Orense) * In Portugal: ::- S√£o Pedro de Lourosa (Lourosa da Beira) ::- Catedral de Idanha-a-Velha (Idanha-a-Velha) Gallery Image:San Baudelio Frontal.jpgSan Baudelio de Berlanga, Soria.

A close associate of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, he held several important state functions of Serbia and FR Yugoslavia during the 1990s. He has been a member of the Socialist Party of Serbia since the party's foundation. He served as the Deputy Prime Minister of FR Yugoslavia in charge of foreign affairs from 1994 to 2000, and represented Milo≈°eviƒá as his emissary in Kosovo affairs from October 1998 during the Kosovo War. He previously served as the Prime Minister of Serbia from 1993-94 and as the minister of Energy and Mining of Serbia and the Deputy Prime Minister of Serbia from 1991-93. In 2009, he was convicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague (ICTY) for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed against ethnic Albanian civilians in 1999 during the Kosovo War. In 2015, he was granted early release after serving two thirds of his sentence. Education and career ≈†ainoviƒá finished primary and secondary school in his hometown and later graduated from the University of Belgrade's Technical Faculty in Bor in 1973. He earned a master's degree from the University of Ljubljana in 1977 as a Chemical engineer. After graduating, he worked as the laboratory technician and student assistant. Soon afterwards he entered politics by becoming a member of the League of Communists of Serbia, Serbian branch of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. He presided for four years over Bor Municipal Committee of the League of Communists and held several important executive positions in Yugoslavian energy powerhouse RTB Bor during the 1980s. In 1989, he became a member of the Executive Council of the Serbian Parliament. At the same time, he was named the Republican Secretary for industry, energy and construction. In 1991, the League of Communists of Serbia transformed into the Socialist Party of Serbia. From 1991-93 he served as the minister of Energy and Mining of Serbia and held the office of the Deputy Prime Minister of Serbia. On 10 February 1993, ≈†ainoviƒá became the president of a minority Government of the Republic of Serbia after the SPS won the largest number of votes in the 20 December 1992 parliamentary election, with support from the Serbian Radical Party. On 18 March 1994, he resigned from office to be appointed Deputy Prime Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in charge of foreign affairs, on 22 February 1994. He soon made greater inner- party progress. On 28 November 1995 he was elected by the SPS party members into the executive council of the Socialist Party of Serbia, as well as its steering committee. The building of the Serbian Government ≈†ainoviƒá was reappointed FRY Deputy Prime Minister in 1996 under Radoje Kontiƒá of the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro after the 3 November 1996 parliamentary election on which SPS won the largest number of votes for the Serbian seats in the Council of Citizens of the FRY Federal Assembly. He was reappointed on new sessions in 1997, and finally on 20 May 1998 under Momir Bulatoviƒá of the Socialist People's Party of Montenegro. FR Yugoslavia and SPS President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá entrusted ≈†ainoviƒá with representing him in 1998 with the Kosovo affairs, where inner-ethnic tensions escalated into a full- scale inter-state conflict. ≈†ainoviƒá presided over the \\"Commission of Cooperation with the Mission for Verification of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Kosovo from October 1998. He signed the Clark- Naumann Agreement, which mandated partial removal of FRY and Serbian forces from Kosovo and limitation of introduction of additional forces and equipment, as well as the deployment of unarmed OSCE verifiers. He was also a member of the Yugoslavian and Serbian delegation under Serbian President Milan Milutinovic in the failed Rambouillet peace talks with the Kosovo Albanian leaders from 7 February to mid-March 1999. He stayed in the office of Deputy Prime Minister of FR Yugoslavia until the overthrow of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá in October 2000.

The song's title makes use of the American slang term \\"all-right\\", which during the 1960s was used to describe something that was considered 'cool' or very good. The song has been covered by a number of bands and artists over the years, including The Byrds, Underground Sunshine, The Doobie Brothers, Alexis Korner, The Ventures, DC Talk, Stryper, Shelagh McDonald, and Robert Randolph (featuring Eric Clapton). The first cover version of the song was recorded by the Los Angeles band The Byrds on their 1969 album, Ballad of Easy Rider. The song was later recorded by The Doobie Brothers, who included it on their 1972 album, Toulouse Street. The Doobie Brothers' version of the song was released as a single in November 1972 and it became a hit in the United States, peaking at No. 35 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 1973, American rock band Exile released their self titled debut album which included a cover. In 1992, the Christian rock and hip hop group, DC Talk, released a version of \\"Jesus Is Just Alright\\" on their Free at Last album. The song has also been covered by Robert Randolph on his Colorblind album, with guest artist Eric Clapton and Stryper's 2013 release, No More Hell to Pay. The Byrds' version The Byrds' version of \\"Jesus Is Just Alright\\" was recorded on June 17, 1969 during the sessions for the band's eighth studio album, Ballad of Easy Rider. It was first released as part of that album but was subsequently issued as a single on December 15, 1969. The single stalled at No. 97 on the Billboard Hot 100 and failed to chart in the United Kingdom. Despite this lack of commercial success, The Doobie Brothers' later hit version of the song featured an arrangement that was heavily influenced by The Byrds' own recording. The song was introduced to The Byrds by the band's drummer, Gene Parsons, who had been present in the studio when The Art Reynolds Singers had recorded it. The Byrds had added the song to their live concert repertoire some months prior to the start of the Ballad of Easy Rider recording sessions and it had quickly become an audience favorite. In concert, The Byrds rendition of \\"Jesus Is Just Alright\\" began with a wordless vocal introduction that built up and led into the first iteration of the song's chorus. This distinctive vocal arrangement had been devised by Parsons but once the band were in the studio, record producer Terry Melcher dispensed with this extended intro, choosing instead to give the song a more pop-oriented arrangement. \\"Jesus Is Just Alright\\" became a staple of The Byrds' concert repertoire between 1969 and 1971 but appears to have been performed only rarely after that. Additionally, the band performed the song on the U.S. television programs Memphis Talent Party and The Midnight Special in 1970 and 1972 respectively. Besides its appearance on the Ballad of Easy Rider album, \\"Jesus Is Just Alright\\" can also be found on several Byrds' compilations, including The Best of The Byrds: Greatest Hits, Volume II, History of The Byrds, The Byrds, The Essential Byrds, and There Is a Season. Live recordings of the song are included on the expanded edition of The Byrds' (Untitled) album as well as on Live at Royal Albert Hall 1971. The Doobie Brothers' version The Doobie Brothers' version of \\"Jesus Is Just Alright\\" was first released on their second album, Toulouse Street, in 1972. It was subsequently released in November 1972 as the second single from the album (b/w \\"Rockin' Down the Highway\\") and went on to become a U.S. hit, peaking at No. 35 on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1973. The single featured a shorter, edited version of the song compared to the one included on the album. The Doobie Brothers' version of \\"Jesus Is Just Alright\\" was one of a number of religiously themed songs to reach the U.S. charts between 1969 and 1973, along with \\"Spirit in the Sky\\" by Norman Greenbaum, \\"Put Your Hand in the Hand\\" by Ocean, \\"Superstar\\" by Murray Head, \\"Morning Has Broken\\" by Cat Stevens, \\"Jubilation\\" by Paul Anka, \\"Speak to the Sky\\" by Rick Springfield, \\"Jesus Was a Capricorn\\" by Kris Kristofferson, \\"My Sweet Lord\\" by George Harrison and \\"I Knew Jesus (Before He Was a Star)\\" by Glen Campbell. The song, along with its B-side, continues to be a staple of playlists on classic rock radio stations. The band first became aware of \\"Jesus Is Just Alright\\" after hearing The Byrds' version and before long the song had been added to The Doobie Brothers' own live repertoire. As a result, the song's musical arrangement is very similar to the one used by The Byrds, although The Doobie Brothers' rendition does include an extra bridge that the band added themselves. In 2007, bassist Tiran Porter claimed that the idea of adding a slow bridge was his, including the lyrics \\"Jesus is my friend\\", but due to the high vocal range demanded, guitarist Patrick Simmons sang lead instead of him.Fox, Brian. Bass Player Magazine; accessed December 31, 2015. Although none of the individual band members were religiously inclined, the song went on to become very popular among Christians during the early 1970s, particularly those within the hippie counterculture that were involved with the Jesus movement. In addition to its appearance on Toulouse Street, the song can also be found on a number of Doobie Brothers' compilations, including Best of The Doobies, Listen to the Music: The Very Best of The Doobie Brothers, Long Train Runnin': 1970‚Äì2000, Greatest Hits, and The Very Best of The Doobie Brothers. Live recordings of the song appear on the Farewell Tour, Rockin' down the Highway: The Wildlife Concert, and Live at Wolf Trap albums.

It was the lead single for their 1992 platinum-selling and Grammy Award-winning album, Free at Last. The band's primary songwriter, TobyMac (Toby McKeehan), retained the song's chorus but added a number of new verses consisting of his own lyrics. These lyrics were rapped, as was usual with DC Talk's songs of the period, with the lead vocal alternating between McKeehan's rapped verses and the sung chorus provided by Kevin Max (then known as Kevin Smith) and Michael Tait. DC Talk's version also includes subtle lyric alterations, with the line \\"Jesus is just alright\\" being intermittently changed to \\"Jesus is still alright\\". Thus, DC Talk's recording can be seen as something of an update on the previous version. McKeehan changed the line in an attempt to express his feeling that Jesus was still alright with him even if many others did not share his beliefs. The song's lyrics also comment on the lack of acceptance and recognition that faith-based music often receives from mainstream radio. In addition to being musically based upon the earlier Byrds and Doobie Brothers' recordings, DC Talk's version of the song also features samples of Madonna's hit single \\"Vogue\\" and the Snap! song \\"The Power\\". In the audio commentary of the Free at Last ‚Äì The Movie bonus DVD, Tait identified \\"Jesus Is Just Alright\\" as the song that DC Talk have performed most in their live shows. It has been played at every concert since 1992 and is the only song to be played on each of their four major headlining tours: Free At Last (1994), Jesus Freak ‚Äì The Tour (Spring 1996), The Supernatural Experience (Spring 1999), and An Evening with DC Talk (Spring 2001).

Political career Born Carlos Guiral y M√°rquez Sterling on September 8, 1898, in Camag√ºey, Cuba, M√°rquez Sterling was the son of Captain Guillermo Guiral Dominguez of the Spanish Army and Maria Dolores M√°rquez Sterling y Loret de Mola, the sister of Cuban President Manuel M√°rquez Sterling who also served as Cuba's Ambassador to the United States for a short time in 1934. This article misidentifies him as the son of the Cuban Ambassador to the U.S. He married twice, first Silvia Dominguez y O'Mahony and then Uva Hernandez Cata. He had two sons, Carlos and Manuel Marquez Sterling y Dominguez. M√°rquez Sterling was an attorney and professor of law and economics at the University of Havana. He founded the Manuel M√°rquez Sterling School of Journalism at the University of Havana. He served as a member of Cuba's House of Representatives as a member of the Liberal Party and was elected president of that body in April 1936 after weeks of deadlocked negotiations among parties, none of which controlled a majority of votes in the chamber. Following the impeachment of President Miguel Mariano Gomez in December, which ended the three-party coalition that had supported him, he was forced to resign in February 1937 following a 101 to 28 vote of no confidence. He also served as Minister of State and Minister of Education. In 1940, he was the president of the constitutional assembly that over the course of six months wrote the 1940 Constitution of Cuba. President Fulgencio Batista named him Secretary of Labor in his first cabinet in 1941. He resigned after a few weeks to seek election as president of the House of Representatives, a post he held for about a year before resigning for reasons of ill health in August 1942. In the 1950s, he was detained many times by the government of Fulgencio Batista because of his opposition to Batista dictatorship. He ran unsuccessfully in the 1958 Cuban general election for President of Cuba as head of the Free Peoples Party. The following year the government of Fidel Castro placed him under house arrest. He then went into exile. Exile He taught at Columbia University and at C.W. Post College on Long Island. In 1979, he moved to Miami and taught at Biscayne College (now St. Thomas University) and gave conferences at Florida International University. He also wrote opinion columns for the Spanish-language newspaper Diario Las Am√©ricas. He authored more than twenty books, including a history of Cuba, Historia de Cuba Desde Col√≥n Hasta Castro (1963). In 1984, the Florida House of Representatives honored him for his contribution to \\"Cuba, democracy, justice and liberty\\". He died on May 3, 1991 in Miami, Florida. He is buried in Miami Memorial Park Cemetery.

The plans still had to be presented and agreed by the British government's Department for Communities and Local Government, and there was local opposition via the Fulcrum Prodrive Action Group (FPAG) to protect the rural nature of the community and the safety of the people that live within it. However, following rule changes banning so-called 'customer' cars from competing in F1, and legal proceedings undertaken by existing F1 manufacturer teams, Prodrive's F1 plans were shelved indefinitely. Since the sale of the site to Jaguar Land Rover in 2014, Prodrive's business remains based at their Banbury headquarters. It is also the site of the HON (Honiley) VOR-DME navigation aid, which is positioned to the south of the track. The old turbine development buildings, previously re-purposed and used as administration offices by Lucas Automotive have been left by Prodrive in the same state they were when Lucas first vacated the site and have become a popular site for Urban Explorers.

On his return in 1957 he gave his first New York recital. In 1964 Fuller was made a professor at the Juilliard School of Music. In 1972 he co-founded the Aston Magna Foundation for Music and Humanities and became its artistic director. The Foundation's aims are to \\"enrich the appreciation of music of the past and the understanding of the cultural, political, and social contexts in which it was composed and experienced.\\" Following a dispute with the Aston Magna board, Fuller left the group in 1983. Two years later, he founded the Helicon Foundation, a New York presenting organization devoted to chamber music performances on original instruments and in period style. Fuller retired as president and artistic director of Helicon at the end of the 2005-2006 season, having led the organization for 21 years. Upon his retirement, James Roe was appointed artistic director and William A. Simon became president. Fuller wrote the memoir Alice Tully: An Intimate Portrait (University of Illinois Press, 1999), and translated, from the French, Hugues Cuenod With a Nimble Voice: Conversations With Francois Hudry (Pendragon Press, 1999). He is prominently featured in Paul Festa's 2006 Messiaen documentary Apparition of the Eternal Church, and in the book based on it, OH MY GOD: Messiaen in the Ear of the Unbeliever. Fuller died at his home of congestive heart failure.

The device is for ophthalmologists, particularly those that focus in vitreo-retinal surgery, a type of eye surgery. It was developed by OptiMedica, an ophthalmic medical device company located in Silicon Valley (Sunnyvale, CA). History The PASCAL (PAtterned SCAnning Laser) method of photocoagulation was initially developed at Stanford University. OptiMedica founders worked together at Coherent, and based on their experience in the ophthalmic laser industry, recognized the need for improved safety, precision, comfort and speed of photocoagulation procedures for eye diseases.RETINA - Fulltext: Volume 26(3) March 2006 p 370-376 Semi- Automated Pattern Scanning Laser for Retinal Photocoagulation Ophthalmic company, Topcon Corp. has distributed the PASCAL system since 2008, and acquired OptiMedica's retina and glaucoma technology in August 2010. Ophthalmic laser delivery systems Most ophthalmic laser delivery systems include: * A laser source such as the Nd:YAG laser used in Pascal * A delivery device such as a slit lamp or laser indirect ophthalmoscope (LIO) * A control system for selecting power and duration * A method for selecting spot size The Pascal system is fully integrated with a touch screen GUI, advanced slit lamp optics, slit lamp mounted micromanipulator, and ergonomic features for the physician and patient. Pascal Method - pattern scanning In scanning applications, a control system applies an electric current proportional to the desired location of a beam of light to a high speed, sensitive, limited rotation motor called a galvanometer (commonly referred to as a galvo). A scanner is a galvo with a mirror attached to it. When the current is changed, the scanner quickly steers the laser beam to the desired location. Closed loop circuits ensure that the desired position is precisely reached. In Pascal, control selections such as pattern and spot size from the graphic user interface are translated into (F,X,Y) coordinates. Three scanners deliver laser light to the retina in multi-spot patterns by controlling the x-position (X), y-position(Y) and fiber selection(F) for the placement and size of the laser beam. The use of a FPGA from National Instruments enables fast scanning speed and a short response time of 4 microseconds for critical measurements and controlled feedback. Indications for use Pascal Photocoagulator was approved in 2005 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration through a 510(k) for treating vascular and structural abnormalities of the retina and choroids including:https://www.fda.gov/cdrh/pdf6/K062336.pdf * Proliferative and non proliferative diabetic retinopathy * Choroidal neovascularization * Branch and central retinal vein occlusion * Age-related macular degeneration * Lattice degeneration * Retinal tears and detachments * Iridotomy * Iridectomy * Trabeculoplasty in angle closure and open angle glaucoma Pascal photocoagulator also has [CE Mark] for international sale. Awards In 2007, OptiMedica received a R&D; 100 Award for its work on the Pascal Photocoagulator. The Pascal Photocoagulator received a Medical Design Excellence Award gold medal in 2007 and a Wall Street Journal Technology Innovation award in 2008.

Sixth Generation director Zhang Yang also plays a role. The film represents a relatively new genre in China, the artistic \\"commercial film\\" with its international urban sensibilities designed to appeal to young middle-class Chinese. Spring Subway is a stylistic film that plays with chronological conventions and flashbacks, and with characters that often break the fourth wall to directly address the audience. The film was produced by China Youth Film Studio and the independent Electric Orange Entertainment (run by screenwriter, Liu Fendou). Distribution was handled by Media Asia Entertainment Group.  Plot  Jianbin (Geng Le) and Xiaohui (Xu Jinglei) are a young couple living in Beijing who have been married for seven years. As the film starts, the couple has begun to grow bored with their existence bringing their relationship to an impasse. Xiaohui, who works at a designing firm, tentatively begins a flirtatious relationship with one of her customers, Lao Hu, a coffee-shop owner (played by director Zhang Yang). Jianbin, meanwhile, has recently been laid off, though he keeps it a secret from his wife by dressing for work every morning, hiding his briefcase in a public bathroom and riding the Beijing metro for most of the day. While riding the subway every day, Jianbin (and the audience) becomes aware of various romances and relationships blossoming around him. Wang Yao (Fan Wei), a thirty-four-year-old cook is despondent when his blind date, Li Chuan (Wang Ning), is seriously injured in a natural gas explosion. Meanwhile, a fellow subway passenger, a health food saleswoman (Ke Lan) who hawks her goods every day on the same subway car, discovers her boyfriend has been cheating on her and has decided to leave her. The unlikely pair of the cook and the saleswoman eventually find love and become engaged to be married. Another relationship also begins in the subway between Da Ming (Tu Qiang), a young man, and a photo-development salesgirl, Tian Ai (Gao Yuanyuan). The man, painfully shy, takes pictures of himself with a note asking to meet the girl, but he flees at the last moment. When Tian Ai finally finds and confronts him, he is too ashamed to speak, but manages to communicate to her his cell phone number as the train pulls away. As for Jianbin, his life seems to spiral more out of control. Unable to pay the rent, and quickly running out of money, he also becomes aware that his wife may be having an affair, though Xiaohui keeps her relationship with Lao Hu strictly platonic. Jianbin, however, tells his wife that his \\"work\\" has decided to send him to France for training, and he begins to contemplate leaving Xiaohui while he visits the blinded schoolteacher after learning about her from Wang Yao. Pretending to be the cook, the two begin a close friendship. After Jianbin decides to confront Lao Hu in a scene where he lights the latter man's newspaper on fire, Jianbin and Xiaohui's relationship seems to be on the brink of self-destruction, as neither is willing to reveal the truth about themselves. Xiaohui, however, finally learns that Jianbin has lost his job and has been riding the subway for the past six months from Wang Yao, just as Jianbin leaves for his \\"trip.\\" Instead of heading to the airport, Jianbin heads to the hospital to see Li Chuan's bandages to come off. But he leaves before she can see him, as Jianbin realizes that he still loves his wife. Xiaohui and Jianbin then meet in the same subway station where they first arrived in Beijing seven years ago as the film ends.  Cast  * Geng Le as Liu Jianbin, a 28-year-old in Beijing, Liu has recently lost his job, though he still pretends to go to work everyday, spending much of his time riding Beijing's subway; * Xu Jinglei as Chen Xiaohui, Liu's wife of seven years; * Zhang Yang as Lao Hu, a customer at Xiaohui's design company; * Wang Ning as Li Chuan, an injured schoolteacher; * Fan Wei as Wang Yao, a cook; * Ke Lan as a saleswoman, the film never names her, and she is credited only as Public Relations; * Gao Yuanyuan as Tian Ai, a shopgirl and the object of Da Ming's affection; * Tu Qiang as Da Ming, a young man who Jianbin meets on the train.  Production history  The film is Zhang Yibai's first feature film directorial effort. Until Spring Subway, Zhang had worked primarily in the music video genre and in television. Spring Subway is also the first film to come out Liu Fendou's independent Beijing-based Electric Orange Entertainment. The film is also Liu's first attempt at both producing and screenwriting. Unlike many independent films in China, however, Spring Subway was made with official approval from the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television. The film's tagline in Chinese translates as: \\"After 7 years, is there still love?\\" Music The film's music was scored by Zhang Yadong and features vocals by the pop rock band Yu Quan.  Reception  Spring Subway is significant in that it represents a new style of Chinese film. Unlike the more controversial works of Sixth Generation directors Jia Zhangke or Wang Xiaoshuai, whose films often are banned by state authorities, Zhang Yibai's Spring Subway enjoyed state approval. As a result, it is, as one critic suggests, an example of the \\"ambitious independent Chinese film\\" that avoids major state-owned studios but nevertheless retains a significant amount of both international and domestic popularity. In particular, Zhang's film reflects a new optimism that is a break from typical Chinese international fare, while others have commented that the film is indeed more \\"international\\" in its sensibilities. One critic at the Hawaii International Film Festival praised the film's universal appeal in that the film's story could have \\"take[n] place in any city, and surely anyone who has loved has experienced at least part of what these characters come to know.\\" Spring Subway has found some success on the film festival circuit, including Udine, Cannes, Seattle and others. It was also released domestically in China in May 2002.

Except for a single East Pacific species, all reside in warmer parts of the West Atlantic, including the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico.

Although sizes vary slightly by species, they are generally about long.E. oceanops, Fishbase. http://www.fishbase.org/Summary/SpeciesSummary.php?id=3876 They have dark bodies with iridescent stripes running from the tip of the nose to the base of the caudal fin. The color of the stripes varies by species. Like all gobies, their dorsal fin is split in two, the anterior dorsal fin being rounded like that of a clownfish and the posterior dorsal fin being relatively flat. The anal fin lines up with the posterior dorsal fin and is of similar shape. The pectoral fins are nearly circular, and, like all other fins, transparent. Distribution Except for the East Pacific E. puncticulatus, all gobies of the genus Elacatinus reside in warmer parts of the western Atlantic, ranging from Florida and Bermuda, through the Bahamas, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico to the coasts of Central America and northern South America (south to Brazil). Among the species is E. oceanops that resides in the Caribbean Sea, the Florida Keys and the Bahama Islands. They have been found along the northern Yucatan Peninsula. Diet Elacatinus are generally carnivorous, with their primary diet consisting of ectoparasites on skins, fins, mouth and gill chambers of their clients. Depending on their ecological circumstances, they may also feed on zooplankton and non-parasitic copepods. Although they are carnivorous, Elacatinus occasionally consume algae and other plants as secondary food source. Physiology=Sex reversal Some species of gobies exhibit gonochorism and protogynous hermaphroditism, including bidirectional sex reversal. Protogyny refers to a category of hermaphroditism where female organs develop or mature before the appearance of male product. In most males of Tellostei gobiidae, this characteristic is observed. Among those in the genus Elacatinus, protogyny is observed in E. illecebrosus. Protogynous hermaphroditism in gobies consists of a male reproductive system with paired, secretory, accessory gonadal structures (AGSs) associated with the testis. While the AGS is almost universally present in male gobies, protogynous females need to develop AGSs for sex reversal to take place. The AGSs develop from precursive tissues (pAGSs), in the form of bilateral, ventrally localized cell masses, located close to the junction of the ovarian lobes and the oviduct. At the time of sex change, it undergoes rapid growth and diverts to form the AGSs. When pAGSs develop into AGSs, ovigerous tissue is also completely replaced by seminiferous lobules. However, the ovarian lumen remains even after the sex change, functioning as a common spermatozoa collection region that is continuous with the common genital sinus as free spermatozoa travels from seminiferous lobules into the gonadal lumen. Gonochorism refers to development or evolution of sex. Gonochoric goby species normally do not possess pAGSs, but pAGSs are observed in E. illecebrosus and E. evelynae. Specifically, the ovarian lobes of small-sized juvenile females of these species possess distinctive pAGSs that started to diminish and then disappeared as they approach adulthood. Development Gobies are multiply spawning species, usually spawning from February to April. After spawning, male gobies guard and oxygenate eggs by frequent movement of their pectoral and caudal fins; males consume any eggs affected by fungus. However, after hatching, the larvae receive no parental protection. Around 30 days after hatching, the larvae begin metamorphosis into juvenile gobies. Behavior=Mating Elacatinus species usually maintain social monogamy, a system in which heterosexual pairs remain closely associated during both reproductive and nonreproductive periods. Males and females of Elacatinus forage together, occupying a single cleaning station and servicing client fish in pairs. Such behavior observed in Elacatinus is attributed to low costs and high benefits for both sexes that result from being paired with a single, large partner. Males benefit from forming monogamous pairs with large females since they tend to have higher fecundity, while females are able to gain more resources by cleaning under the protection of a larger male. Females experience reduced cleaning rate overall when cleaning with a male. However, they spend more time in each cleaning session, so are able to feed on more ectoparasites compared to those with a smaller mate. If large body size also correlates with better paternal care is not confirmed, as it is difficult to observe caring behavior of Elacatinus whose males tend eggs that are laid deep within a small coral cavity. Intrasexual aggression used as a means to guard mates is proposed as a primary mechanism of maintaining monogamy. Both males and females were observed to be very aggressive toward same-sex intruders that come to their territory to accost their partners. However, several biological and ecological factors also enforce monogamy in these cleaner gobies. Elacatinus species reproduce asynchronously, which makes polygyny unfavorable. Furthermore, although it differs among species, cleaner gobies tend to live in environments of low population density where distance between potential mates is rather far. Although it is seldom, polygyny is observed in Elacatinus. Mated males may approach a new female if she is larger than their mate. Polygyny may also be exhibited in widowed males and females. When Elacatinus spp. are widowed, they often leave their cleaning territory. However, the vacant territory is not claimed by other cleaner gobies, which implies that the widowed gobies actually chose to move instead of being forced. This observation shows that the widowed gobies possibly have moved to search for new mate. Mutualism Mutualism refers to relationship where one or both partners provide a service or resources to the other. Caribbean cleaning gobies engage in mutualism by removing and feeding on ectoparasites on their clients. They present themselves and wait for clients at cleaning stations, as they largely depend on cleaning for their food. Elacatinus spp. often clean in pairs, where pairs are most often composed of a male and a female. Occupying the same territory, the cleaner pair usually cleans the same client at the same time. Cleaning gobies generally service a wide range of clients; however, members of the genus Elacatinus are considered the most specialized cleaner gobies in tropical western Atlantic. Most frequent clients of Elacatinus include damselfish, Pomacentridae and Haemulidae, and planktivores. Rather than seeking their clients actively, they remain close to their cleaning station and seldom move more than a meter laterally. They do, however, dance in zig- zag swimming pattern to attract clients. Hosts come to the cleaning sites and pose to show their intent to receive service. Such poses are usually directed at the cleaning station rather than the individual gobies. However, not all the potential clients, or those that pose, are attended by cleaners. Duration of cleaning may range from a few seconds to almost half an hour. In observational studies, decreases in cleaning frequency turned out to be correlated to increases in cleaning durations. The rate of feeding and cleaning duration most likely reflect the number of parasites on clients' bodies. Predator‚Äìprey relationship Elacatinus has a unique response to predators' approach. Fish response to danger is largely classified into fight- or-flight or freezing. However, Elacatinus follows neither. It engages in cleaning interactions with potential predators sooner than with nonpredatory clients, treating them almost as soon as they arrive at their cleaning stations. Furthermore, Elacatinus species clean predators for longer durations. As implied by higher cortisol level in the cleaners when approached by predators, the fish do experience stress upon encountering predators, but unlike other fish that exhibit flight or freezing response, Elacatinus spp. demonstrates a proactive response. Elacatinus is thought to choose to be proactive, as cleaning predators faster makes them leave sooner, which in turn encourages nonpredatory clients to revisit cleaning stations. Moreover, such proactive response may serve as a pre-conflict management strategy that might result in safe outcome for interactions with certain predators. Coloration Common stripe patterns in Elacatinus include yellow, green, and blue; however, those possessing blue stripes were found to be most effective in attracting clients, as well as deterring predators. Four of six cleaner species of the genus Elacatinus display such coloration‚ÄîE.oceanops, E.evelynae, E.genie, and E.prochilos. E.puncticulatus and E.nesiotes engage in cleaner activity, but do not possess blue stripes. One of the ways Elacatinus signals its clients is through unique blue stripes that distinguish them from their noncleaning sister species; while their noncleaning relatives possess yellow or green stripes that blend well with their sponge dwellings, cleaning Elacatinus spp. advertise their presence to potential clients by sitting on top of substrate such as coral. The characteristic blue stripe only observed in the cleaner lineage of gobies marks great contrast with the coral microhabitats compared to other stripe colors found in gobies, so allow them to be spotted easily. Blue stripes of Elacatinus play a role as signals for cooperation in addition to advertisement. Additionally, Elacatinus spp. possessing blue stripes deterred or survived significantly more attacks as compared to green and yellow gobies. Cheating Some Elacatinus cleaners cheat by feeding on scales and mucus of clients in addition to ectoparasites on their clients, which is confirmed by examination of their stomach contents. However, cheating may result in punishment. When clients realize that they are being cheated on, they interrupt the cleaning interaction and swim away or do not return to the gobies' cleaning station in the future, which may result in the cheater obtaining less resources than they could have obtained without cheating. This client behavior is similar to sanction strategy, where one partner restrains its biological investment. This strategy has been proven effective in keeping interspecies mutualism stable, and such cheating behavior is not readily observed in Elacatinus. They prefer to feed on ectoparasites over client mucus or scale. Therefore, they most likely cheat only when ectoparasites supply is depleted in clients. In the aquarium Members of the genus Elacatinus, particularly E. oceanops, are among the most popular marine aquarium inhabitants. Neon goby (E. oceanops) Several species of neon goby are readily available because of successful captive-breeding programs, although scientific names are not always given. Generally, if the specimen has a blue stripe, it can be identified as E. oceanops, and if the stripe is half- blue and half-gold, it is E. evelynae. Various species are offered as \\"gold neon gobies\\". Neon gobies are not difficult to keep, and accept a wide variety of water parameters. Specific gravity is not critical, so long as it remains steady. As with all marine aquarium fish, they are sensitive to even trace amounts of ammonia or nitrite in an aquarium. Small amounts of nitrate are acceptable, but significant amounts over the long term can cause problems. Neon gobies are tolerant of a broad range of temperatures, but they are tropical, so a heater may be necessary to maintain a temperature of at least year round. Other parameters, such as alkalinity, only become a problem if they are extreme.

Implicit was launched by Wilmington Boat Works, Wilmington, California 1 August 1953; sponsored by Mrs. Landon Horton, and commissioned 10 March 1954 Lt. Comdr. A. G. Filiatrault in command.  West Coast deployment  One of a class of new minesweepers constructed entirely of nonmagnetic materials, Implicit conducted shakedown training in California waters during mid-1954. She then began an operational pattern which was to continue for three years: minesweeping exercises, fleet maneuvers, and training cruises in the California-Mexico area. The ship then got underway from her home port, Long Beach, California, 7 August 1957 to join the U.S. 7th Fleet in the strategic Far East. During this deployment, Implicit operated with Japanese ships, Nationalist Chinese minesweepers, and with regular units of the U.S. 7th Fleet on their daily mission of maintaining peace and security in the area. She returned to Long Beach 1 March 1958.  Second Far East cruise  Training and readiness exercises out of Long Beach occupied the minesweeper until her second cruise to the Far East. She steamed out of Long Beach 8 January 1960 and during six months in the western Pacific Ocean took part in mine warfare exercises with 7th Fleet ships in the Philippines and off Okinawa. Implicit arrived Long Beach after this cruise 17 July 1960.  Participating in joint U.S.-Canadian exercises  Training operations and mine countermeasures drill were carried out until August 1961, when the veteran minecraft took part in joint American-Canadian mine-sweeping exercises off British Columbia.  Supporting Vietnam operations  Returning to Long Beach, the ship prepared for another Far Eastern deployment, this time in support of the American advisory effort in South Vietnam. Sailing 2 January 1962 for this embattled country, Implicit first participated in SEATO maneuvers and then moved to various ports in South Vietnam to assist in training officers and men. She returned to Long Beach from South Vietnam 17 August 1962.  Joint exercises with the Taiwanese Navy  Implicit resumed a schedule of underway training and fleet exercises out of Long Beach until her next deployment, sailing with her division 3 January 1964. Stopping at Guam and Midway Island en route, she arrived off Formosa for mine-warfare exercises in March. In May she returned to the Formosa Strait for a second operation, in which the ship acted under a Chinese Nationalist division commander in a demonstration of cooperation and smooth combined operations. Following her second SEATO exercise in the Pacific, Implicit resumed to Long Beach 28 July 1964 for a yard overhaul and readiness tactics and training along the coast of California.  Supporting Operation Market Time  Implicit in 1954. Implicit departed Long Beach 21 September 1965 for the Far East. A unit of Mine Division 91, she joined the \\"Market Time Patrol\\" along Vietnam's 1,000-mile coastline to intercept Vietcong men and supplies trying to infiltrate into South Vietnam. Once she was fired on by Vietcong while cruising close to shore and retaliated with her 40mm. and other machineguns. After a 2-week stopover, Implicit departed Kaohsiung, Taiwan, 14 January to continue her \\"Market Time\\" patrols into late 1966. By 15 March she had boarded more than 1,000 junks and sampans for inspection. On 22 and 23 March, the minesweeper fired nearly 700 rounds of 40mm. ammunition supporting small South Vietnamese naval craft under fire from enemy shore batteries. On 28 June Implicit got underway with a mine division for Long Beach, California, via Guam, Kwajalein, and Pearl Harbor arriving Long Beach, 2 August From 13 to 20 September she participated in minesweeping Operation Eager Angler off Santa; Rosa Island. Implicit joined a carrier task unit for Operation COMPTUEX through December and then continued training operations off Long Beach into 1967.  Decommissioning  Implicit was decommissioned 30 September 1994 and handed over to the Taiwanese Navy the same day as Yung Yang. She was struck from the Navy List 20 November 1994. Her ultimate fate is unknown.

While asset allocation (AA) determines what assets to own and in what proportions, AL determines where those assets are held. While the objective of AA is to create portfolios with the greatest return for a level of risk, and to optimize individuals' risk exposure according to their risk tolerance, goals and investment time frame, the objective of AL is to maximize the benefits of different account-types - usually to minimize taxes. There are other objectives that can be personal (e.g., the liquidity of the wealth, the expected use of the funds, privacy, etc.). In the discussion below the effective tax rate for any asset depends on a personal tax bracket, different countries' treatment of different types of income, personal frequency of realizing the tax liability (e.g. capital gains only taxable when sold after a multi-year holding period), the mix of income-types generated by an asset, and the net tax effect that includes both tax debits and credits (e.g. the treatment of dividend income in Canada and Great Britain).Robert M. Dammon, Chester S. Spatt and Harold H. Zhang, ‚ÄúOptimal Asset Location and Allocation with Taxable and Tax-Deferred Investing‚Äù, Journal of Finance, Vol. LIX, No. 3 June 2004. Location Choice Methodology=Tax Rates Although there is no academic support, it is common (now declining) to hear that assets with the highest effective tax rates should be prioritized in tax-shelter accounts. This will have been broadly appropriate over the 30 years from the 1980s to the 2000s in North America, as interest rates declined and debt's total returns matched the returns of equity. The rule is dependent on the assumption that total returns from different asset-types are equal. When interest rates are low and expected to rise that assumption will not be valid. Tax Efficiency Another common metric to decide which assets should be prioritized is tax-efficiency.Boglehead Wiki, ‚ÄúPrinciples of Tax-Efficient Fund Placement‚Äù This equals the dollars of tax payable per principal invested - the multiple of the asset's rate of return by its effective tax rate. Another way to look at the same metric is as the difference between the asset's nominal rate of return and its after-tax rate of return. This metric measures the tax-sheltering benefits of the first year only. Reed C.Reed, ‚ÄúRethinking Asset Location - between tax-deferred, tax-exempt and taxable accounts‚Äù, August 2013. finds that this metric fails over the life of the accounts. Given two assets with the same tax-efficiency, the asset with the larger rate of return will always create larger benefits in tax-exempt accounts. Even when a high-return asset has a lower tax-efficiency, given enough time it creates more benefits. It is only when the effective tax rate is very low that its importance relative to the rate of return is equally strong or stronger. Cumulative Benefit Reed\\"Rethinking Asset Location\\" calculates the cumulative tax savings over varying time spans from tax-free growth. For tax-deferred accounts there may be an additional bonus (or penalty) from a lower (or higher) tax rate on withdrawal vs. contribution. Assets with the largest benefits are given priority into tax shelters. He points out that re-balancing to some asset allocation will reduce the benefits from asset location. He concludes that 'it all depends' and general rules of thumb are not valid. For example, given enough time high return assets create the largest benefits from tax-free growth, but there may not be enough time, or the high return asset may result in a portfolio large enough to create a penalty from higher withdrawal tax rates. Asset Types Common advice is to locate tax-inefficient assets (such as bonds and real estate investment trusts) in the tax-advantaged accounts.William W. Jennings and William Reichenstein, ‚ÄúThe Literature of Private Wealth Management‚Äù, The Research Foundation of CFA Institute, 2006. This is to fully utilize any long-term capital gain, or capital gains allowances available in taxable accounts. Place income-generating investments into tax-deferred or non-taxable accounts, and place equity investments into taxable accounts. The deciding factor is apparently the effective tax rate on the asset's income. For the same reason, tax-exempt bonds, national savings certificates and other similar tax- privileged securities are best located in fully taxable accounts.James Poterba, John Shoven & Clemens Sialm, ‚ÄúAsset Location for Retirement Savers‚Äù, Chapter 10, Private Pensions and Public Policies Shoven and SialmJohn B. Shoven and Clemens Sialm, ‚ÄúAsset Location in Tax-Deferred and Conventional Savings Accounts‚Äù, NBER Working Paper No. 7192, June 1999, JEL No. G11,G23,H24 provided an analysis of the decision point when income producing equities should be sheltered and optimal portfolio choice for each type of account. Individual stocks, passive index funds, or exchange-traded funds are generally regarded as tax-efficient and, consequently, better placed in taxable accounts, when more heavily taxed income generating assets, such as bonds, real estate investment trusts, and so on, are available for secretion in a tax sheltered location. Actively managed mutual funds or unit trusts may also prove to be better located in tax-sheltered vehicles, because equities held through financial intermediaries tend to be taxed more, due to high turnover, than individual equities held by an investor for the long term, who has the opportunity to plan the realization of gains and offset losses. Siegel and MontgomeryLaurence B. Siegel and David Montgomery, ‚ÄúStocks, Bonds, and Bills after Taxes and Inflation.‚Äù Journal of Portfolio Management, vol. 21, no. 2 (Winter 1995):17‚Äì25. demonstrate conclusively that taxes and inflation substantially dampen compound returns especially for equity investors. An Alternate Model William Reichenstein William Reichenstein, ‚ÄúAsset Allocation and Asset Location Decisions Revisited‚Äù, Journal of Wealth Management, Summer 2001 proposes an alternate model. He ignores completely the tax-sheltering benefits of tax-deferred and tax-exempt accounts. His AL objective is not to maximize those benefits. He uses the AL to fine-tune the AA decision using mean-variance optimization (MVO) of Modern portfolio theory. MVO uses the means, variances, and co-variance matrix of all assets, along with a utility function to manage risk tolerances. When assets are held in taxable accounts their after-tax means and variances will be smaller than for those in tax- shelter accounts. Reichenstein considers each asset-type to have a taxable variant and an tax-free variant, with their different metrics. The MVO process results in an optimal AA for both the taxable and the tax-free asset. The AL falls out from this conclusion. Patterns of Behavior Surveys of households have shown that there is often a gulf between where assets are located and where some people think they ought to be, to provide an optimal tax outcome. Reed's re-balancing model rarely shows a difference of more than 10% after 30 years, unless withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts are at lower rates. So it may be that households are correct. Amromin Gene Amromin, ‚ÄúPrecautionary Savings Motives and Tax Efficiency of Household Portfolios:An Empirical Analysis‚Äù, in Tax Policy and the Economy, Volume 22, University of Chicago Press, July 2008 argues that job income insecurity, penalties and restrictions on withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts explain why people are tax- inefficient with their investments. Employers‚Äô matches in defined contribution retirement plans and the structure of the social security system also play a part in driving low tax equity investments into sheltered accounts.Zhe Li, ‚ÄúRetirement Savings and Portfolio Choices in Taxable and Tax-Deferred Accounts‚Äù, Stony Brook University, September 2009 Bodie and CraneBodie, Zvi, and Dwight B. Crane. 1997. ‚ÄúPersonal Investing: Advice, Theory and Practice.‚Äù Financial Analysts Journal, vol. 53, no. 6 (November/December):13‚Äì22 studied TIAA-CREF participants and concluded that investors chose similar asset allocations in their taxable and tax-deferred accounts, with little apparent regard for the benefits of tax efficient asset location. Barber and OdeanBrad M. Barber and Terrance Odean, ‚ÄúAre Individual Investors Tax Savvy? Evidence from Retail and Discount Brokerage Accounts‚Äù, Forthcoming: Journal of Public Economics, October 2002. surveyed brokerage records and found that more than half of the households held taxable bonds in their taxable accounts, despite available alternatives, and that the preference for holding equity mutual funds in retirement accounts appeared to be stronger than that for holding taxable bonds. Other commentators suggest decisions concerning the use of home equity and mortgage debt as a substitute for consumer debt have driven choice of portfolio location.Dean Maki, ‚ÄúPortfolio Shuffling and Tax Reform‚Äù, National Tax Journal, Vol 49 no. 3 (September 1996) pp. 317-329. An idealized example shows that over a 25-year interval, the difference between extreme asset location choices yielded a compounded 18% differential in return.Daniel Bergstresser and James Poterba, ‚ÄúAsset Allocation and Asset Location: Household Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances‚Äù, NBER Working Paper No. 9268, October 2002, JEL No. H2, G2 See also *Asset allocation *Income tax *Personal finance ReferencesExternal links *Investopedia article on Asset Location *Laura F.

Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Hollingsworth batted and threw left-handed. He was listed as tall and . Hollingsworth earned his nickname when, as a first baseman early in his career, he made an error in the field. He became a full-time pitcher during the 1933 season, his sixth in pro ball. Hollingsworth was a member of the 1944 Browns, the only St. Louis-based team to win an American League pennant. Ironically, 1944 was Hollingsworth's worst regular season among the four full years he spent as a Brown; he won only five of 12 decisions, posted a poor 4.47 earned run average, and surrendered 108 hits and 37 bases on balls in 92 innings pitched, with only 22 strikeouts. He appeared in Game 4 of the \\"All- St. Louis\\" 1944 World Series, allowing one run in four innings pitched in relief of starting pitcher Sig Jakucki. He had two stellar seasons for the Browns, however, in 1942 and 1945, each time compiling winning records with an ERA of under 3.00. Hollingsworth was also involved in a noteworthy trade earlier in his career when, on June 13, 1938, he was sent by Cincinnati to the Philadelphia Phillies along with catcher Spud Davis and $50,000 in cash for right-handed pitcher Bucky Walters. Walters would win 160 of 267 decisions during his Cincinnati pitching career, and help lead the Reds to the 1939 and 1940 National League pennants, and the 1940 World Series championship. Hollingsworth appeared in 315 Major League games pitched, 185 as a starting pitcher. In 1,520 innings, he allowed 1,642 hits and 587 bases on balls, with 608 strikeouts, seven shutouts and 15 saves. His professional playing career lasted for 20 consecutive seasons, including minor league service. He then had a lengthy post-playing career as a manager in the St. Louis Cardinals and Cleveland Indians organizations, the pitching coach for the Cardinals from April 29, 1957, through 1958, and a scout for the Redbirds, Washington Senators, Houston Astros and Oakland Athletics. As a hitter, Hollingsworth posted a .196 batting average (103-for-525) with 53 runs, 2 home runs, 32 RBI and 23 bases on balls. Defensively, he recorded a .966 fielding percentage. Hollingsworth died April 28, 1996, in Austin, Texas, aged 88.

It is one of the very few Western stories that has been adapted to the screen twice, in 1957 and in 2007. Plot summary Paul Scallen, a deputy marshal, is escorting train robber and wanted fugitive Jimmy Kidd to Tucson to stand trial. The two travel to a small town called Contention, where they prepare to catch a train to Yuma later in the afternoon. The two hole up in a hotel room close to the train station with the help of Mr. Timpey, a representative of Wells Fargo sent to ensure Kidd is brought to justice for stealing the bank's money. Scallen and Kidd wait in the hotel room and spend the next few hours discussing Scallen's pay and motivations. Scallen sees several men waiting outside, who are revealed by Kidd to be his gang, who have been tracking them in secret. Their leader, Kidd's loyal second-in-command Charlie Prince, asks after Kidd, who assures Charlie that he will soon be released and urges Scallen to do so to avoid bloodshed. Scallen refuses and the two continue to wait for the train. Mr. Timpey returns, along with another man named Moon, who is intent on killing Kidd for a crime he was acquitted of in a previous trial. After a brief scuffle in which Scallen incapacitates Moon before he can shoot Kidd, the two leave the hotel room in order to catch the arriving train to Yuma. After reaching the train station, Scallen finds himself surrounded by Charlie‚Äôs men, and after a brief exchange, a gunfight ensues in which Kidd attempts to crawl away while Scallen shoots Charlie and another gang member dead. Scallen makes a break for the train, pulling Kidd onto the car with him. Safely inside the train car, the two agree that Scallen has earned his money. Adaptations The written story is the kernel from which the two films grew, and the source of some dialogue in each film. The names of most characters in the movies differ from those in the story, save that of Charlie Prince, a character in each version.

The Grande polonaise brillante in E-flat, set for piano and orchestra, was written first, in 1830-31. In 1834, Chopin wrote an Andante spianato in G, for piano solo, which he added to the start of the piece, and joined the two parts with a fanfare- like sequence. The combined work was published in 1836, and was dedicated to Madame d'Este. Music The Grande polonaise brillante is a work for piano and orchestra, although the piano part is often played on its own. The Andante spianato (spianato means \\"even\\" or \\"smooth\\") for solo piano was composed as an introduction to the polonaise after Chopin received a long-awaited invitation to perform in one of Habeneck‚Äôs Conservatoire Concerts in Paris. This was the only time Chopin had ever used the term spianato as a description for any of his works. Chopin‚Äôs first work, written at age seven, had been a polonaise. The Grande polonaise brillante of 1830‚Äì31 was to be the last such he would compose for several years. It preoccupied Chopin in his final months at Warsaw. It was finished at Vienna in 1831. Movements *Andante spianato in G major The quiet rippling effects of this introductory section are borne in a gentle 6/8, rounded with a chordal trio, and a more processional 3/4. The serene middle section (in G major) is not a trio, but only a contrasting episode to complement the overall texture of the movement. *Grande polonaise brillante in E-flat major The polonaise opens in fanfare and moves into an ebullient dance form. In 1836, it was arranged as a piano quartet and, two years later, the solo piano work known today. Technical difficulties The grande polonaise brillante is among Chopin's most technically demanding pieces.Polonez Opus 22 Edited by Jan Ekier Polskie Wydawnictwo Muzyczne Technical aspects include: * fast descending thirds * rapid, difficult octave and chord jumps * trills with thirds * quick scales * fast arpeggios in both hands * broken chords * use of a wide range on the piano keyboard. In popular culture The 2002 film The Pianist concludes with this polonaise. The song ‚ÄúLa Soledad‚Äù by pop band Pink Martini begins with an excerpt of the Andante spianato movement and makes use of various melodies from the piece throughout the song.

Pace, a general authority in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), describing to a committee of the church the complaints of sixty members of the church that claimed they had been subjected to satanic ritual abuse (SRA) by family members and other members of the church. The state of Utah conducted a 30-month investigation of the claims after the Pace memorandum was leaked to the press in 1991, concluding that there was no evidence found to substantiate the testimony of the alleged victims. Background The SRA moral panic began in the 1980s as children in the United States, subjected to coercive interviewing techniques at the hands of zealous social workers, made unsubstantiated allegations of bizarre Satanic rituals and horrific sexual and physical abuse at the hands of day care workers. As the decade unfolded, clients of believing therapists began to make similar allegations, which are now generally seen as confabulations caused by iatrogenic therapeutic techniques such as hypnosis and automatic writing rather than the discovery of repressed memories. Despite the similarities between the allegations of adults and children, investigations produced only circumstantial, and in many cases contradictory evidence of the patients' disclosures. The court cases surrounding SRA allegations (such as the iconic McMartin preschool trial) were among the most expensive and lengthy in history and produced no convictions or convictions based solely on the testimony of children that were frequently overturned or dismissed upon appeal. The panic subsided in the late 1990s, but in the early 1990s while it was still a substantial concern, adherents in the LDS Church began telling leaders of the church that they had been subjected to SRA by their relatives‚Äîoften parents‚Äîand other members of the church. The Pace memorandum In July 1990, Pace, who at the time was a member of the church's presiding bishopric, fulfilled a request by the church's Strengthening Church Members Committee by writing a memorandum about his investigations into alleged incidents of SRA among Latter-day Saints in Utah, Idaho, California, Mexico, and elsewhere. Page photoreproductions: 1, 2, 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 The memorandum was leaked to the press in October 1991. In his memo, Pace stated that he had met with sixty victims who had recovered memories of ritualistic abuse during their childhood. Pace reported that children were being \\"instructed in satanic doctrine\\" and that as eight-year- olds they were \\"baptized by blood into the satanic order which is meant to cancel out their baptism into the Church\\". Forty-five of Pace's witnesses claimed to have witnessed or participated in human sacrifice, including the killing of babies. Pace said that the alleged perpetrators included \\"Young Women leaders, Young Men leaders, bishops, a patriarch, a stake president, temple workers, and members of the Tabernacle Choir\\" and that some of the abuse took place in church meetinghouses. Pace wrote that \\"when sixty witnesses testify to the same type of torture and murder, it becomes impossible for me, personally, not to believe them.\\" Pace compared these allegations to stories in LDS Church scriptures about secret combinations and Cain's combination with Satan to become Master Mahan. Pace also suggested that the alleged abusers were using and corrupting the oaths in the church's temple endowment ceremony as part of the Satanic abuse, and that many victims had flashbacks when they attended the temple for the first time and were asked to participate in the ceremonies. Government investigation In 1991, the Utah State Legislature appropriated $250,000 for the Attorney General's office to investigate the RSA allegations in the state of Utah. Over a -year span, the investigators interviewed hundreds of alleged victims, but none of the incidents reported were corroborated with any evidence beyond their testimony, and the 1995 report stated that there was no evidence from any of the alleged victims that would warrant an investigation of homicide. Mike King, the coauthor of the report, told news media that the specific accusations against church leaders were \\"absurd\\", and Jerry Lazar, the head of psychiatry at LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City, said he \\"has never been able to independently verify memories of satanic ritual abuse\\". Church reaction The LDS Church has made no official statement related to the allegations related in the Pace memorandum. However, one commentator has suggested that apostle Richard G. Scott's sermon in the April 1992 general conference of the church may have been related to the SRA allegations.Massimo Introvigne, \\"A Rumor of Devils: Allegations of Satanic Child Abuse and Mormonism, 1985‚Äì1994\\", paper read at the Annual Conference of the Mormon History Association in Park City, Utah, 1994-05-21. In his remarks, Scott warned Latter-day Saints: > I caution you not to participate in ... improper therapeutic practices that > may cause you more harm than good. ... Detailed leading questions that probe > your past may unwittingly trigger thoughts that are more imagination or > fantasy than reality. They could lead to condemnation of another for acts > that were not committed. While likely few in number, I know of cases where > such therapy has caused great injustice to the innocent from unwittingly > stimulated accusations that were later proven false. Memory, particularly > adult memory of childhood experiences, is fallible. Remember, false > accusation is also a sin. In 2018, at least six people sued the daughter of church president Russell M. Nelson for participation in SRA in the 1980s.Walch, Tad. \\"Decades-Old Bountiful Case Alleges Church Connection to Abuse Allegations\\", Deseret News, October 4, 2018. While the church was not named a defendant, the suit claimed that victims approached apostle Neal A. Maxwell, who gave them a priesthood blessing and told them to \\"forgive and forget,\\" and also insinuates that Nelson used his influence to cover up the abuse. The church released a response statement stating that the \\"allegations of interference or cover up are baseless and offensive.\\"Spiewak, Jim. \\"Daughter of LDS Church President at Center of Decades-Old Sex Abuse Cover-up Allegations\\", kutv.com, October 5, 2018.

Several Toyota vehicles have been assembled there as well, including the Celica, Land Cruiser, Land Cruiser Prado, RAV4/Vanguard, WISH, and 4Runner. Employees look through 4,000 details for every car produced. The plant creates a Lexus every 87 seconds, equal to 675 Lexus models per day. When employees enter the factory floor, they pass through an air shower to remove dust. They are required to exercise and perform other physical activities such as holding and rolling golf balls in their palms. These motor exercises keep staff sharp, and Toyota believes these behaviors are essential to help retain the standards necessary to produce flawless vehicles.A Look Inside Toyota's Tahara Plant The New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman visited the plant in the early 1990s, and described the experience as an example of globalization in his best- selling 1999 book, The Lexus and the Olive Tree.Friedman, Thomas L.

He studied medicine in Leiden under Hermann Boerhaave, and in 1754 went to the University of Vienna, where he became head of its medical clinic. He is remembered for teaching students at the bedside of patients. At Vienna, Anton de Haen was an associate to Gerard van Swieten, whom he worked with in the establishment of structured medical classes. He was an advocate of post-mortem investigations, as well as maintaining detailed case histories of patients. He was one of the first physicians to make routine use of the thermometer in medicine, and perceived that temperature was a valuable indication of illness and health. Among his written works was Ratio medendi in nosocomio practico, of which 18th century Viennese hospital practices and case histories are discussed. This treatise also described one of the earliest known cases of amenorrhea associated with a pituitary tumor. Works * Aletophilorum quorundam Viennensium elucidatio necessaria Epistolae de cicuta .

According to Ayurveda, the plant is anthelmintic, alexiteric, restorative, and antipyretic. It is used in the treatment of leprosy, ulcers, asthma, and tumors, as well as diseases of the liver, spleen, heart, and blood. A decoction of the roots is given in dyspepsia, diarrhea, rheumatism, asthma and urinary disorders. The root powder is salutary for brushing the teeth, where it is said to quickly relieve dental pains and stop bleeding. An extract, termed 'betaphroline' (not a systematic name) is claimed to promote release of endorphins, and finds use in certain cosmetic preparations. African shepherds use crushed plants to make an antidotal beverage for animals bitten by snakes.  Feed and manure  Tephrosia purpurea has been reported to provide fodder to animals such as goats. It makes also a good green manure in fields. References * * Bishop Museum Hawaiian Ethnobotany Online Database. Downloaded on 24 September 2007.

The second ship to be named Inflict by the Navy, AM-456 was launched 16 October 1953 by Wilmington Boat Works, Inc., Wilmington, California; sponsored by Mrs. Robert E. Carlson; and commissioned 11 May 1954, Lt. G. T. Ragon in command.  West Coast operations  After shakedown along the U.S. West Coast, Inflict engaged in sonar and minesweeping exercises until she departed Long Beach, California, 1 July for the western Pacific Ocean. Arriving Yokosuka, Japan 5 August she began operations with the navies of South Korea, Nationalist China, and Japan, In February 1955 she was reclassified MSO 456. Inflict returned to Long Beach 17 February 1956 and spent the remainder of the year on training operations.  Second Far East tour  In 1957, Inflict continued operations off California and Mexico, helping to maintain one of America's mighty antisubmarine warfare forces. The minesweeper sailed 3 January 1958 for duty in the Far East. She arrived there as a crisis loomed in Indonesia. The strength of this mighty armada made itself felt as the crisis diminished quickly without incident. From 19 to 22 March 1958, Inflict participated in Exercise \\"Bulwark\\", the first bilateral exercise between Philippine and U.S. Navy. It took part in the third phase of the exercise, in waters off Corregidor and Caballo Islands.Coast Defense Exercise Ends, by Bernardo De Leon Jr. Manila Times. 21 March 1958. Inflict participated in joint exercises with the Thailand, and Chinese Nationalist navies before returning to Long Beach on 15 July.  West Coast exercises  For the next 20 months she trained in California waters. On 3 May 1960, Inflict sailed again for six months of joint operations with U.S. allies in Asia, and returned to Long Beach on 16 November. In 1961, Inflict was engaged in minesweeping operations and midshipman training out of Long Beach. She sailed 7 April 1962 for exercises in Hawaiian waters, and returning to Long Beach on 17 August. In 1963, in addition to training in California waters, Inflict sailed on 28 October for joint countermeasure exercises with Canada, and returned to Long Beach on 3 December. On 22 May 1964, she sailed for duty in the Far East, operating with the friendly navies, and during the summer was deployed for service along South Vietnam. Inflict returned to Long Beach on 7 December.  Supporting Market Time operations  She sailed for the Far East on 7 February 1966. Arriving Subic Bay on 28 March, she headed for her \\"Market Time\\" station on 5 April. There, she patrolled to prevent the infiltration of arms and men from North Vietnam to the south. She left the war zone on 1 November and returned to Long Beach on 13 December. Inflict operated on the West Coast through mid-November 1967, when she again sailed for the Far East, with stops in Hawaii, Kwajalein, and Guam, arriving in Subic bay at the beginning of January 1968. She was on her \\"Market Time\\" patrol station when the USS Pueblo was captured in January and during the Tet Offensive in February 1968. She sailed from Subic Bay for the US West Coast in May and arrived in Long Beach in late June. Overhauled in Dillingham Shipyards in Hawaii with the Force MSO445, Fortify MSO446, Impervious MSO 449: replaced Packard diesel engine with Waukasha L1616 turbo diesels. December 1971, following overhaul the 4 ships changed Home port to Guam and became MineFlot 1 under Commander Lloyd Boucher. The Inflict made several Market Time tours from 1971 thru 1973. More memorable events Oct.31 1972 Engineroom fire due to error by Lead EN on watch, failed to apply cooling water to clutch while engine idled. Disabled port shaft had to be towed to Subic Bay for repairs. A month later the Inflict with USS King DLG 10 and US Geodedic Survey team of 4 collected bottom samples and data in preparation for removing US mines from North Vietnamese Harbors etc. Leaving the area off Haiphong Harbor they encountered a convoy of over 40 Chinese Junks with the DPR of China flags. No real engagement as they were in International Waters. It was very eerie. December 1972 many crew members transferred January 1973 Peace Treaty signed with North Vietnam. The Inflict and Mine Flot 1 took part in the removal of US mines with the first Helicopter Minesweepers. Persian Gulf service USS Grapple tows USS Inflict, USS Fearless and USS Illusive. On 6 September 1987, USS Grapple (ARS-53) left Little Creek, Virginia, with three minesweepers in tow: USS Fearless (MSO-442), USS Illusive (MSO-448), and Inflict. They transited the Suez Canal and arrived in the Gulf of Oman on 2 November 1987. The trip set a record for the longest distance three ships were towed by one.Grapple ships history 1987 While conducting minesweeping operations in the northern Persian Gulf, USS Inflict discovered and destroyed the first of ten underwater contact mines deployed in a field across the main shipping channel. These were the first underwater mines discovered and destroyed by the U.S. Navy since the Korean War. Inflict remained in the Persian Gulf to support Operation Earnest Will. Decommissioning  Decommissioned on 30 March 1990 Inflict was stricken 23 May 1990. On 1 December 1992, the Navy sold the ship for $12,000 for scrap.

Geologists refer to the corresponding time-frame as the neotectonic period, and to the preceding time as the palaeotectonic period. Vladimir Obruchev coined the term neotectonics in his 1948 article,V.A. Obruchev (1948). \\"Osnovnye cherty kinetiki i plastiki neotektonik\\". Izv. Akad. Nauk, Ser. Geol., 5: 13‚Äì24 defining the field as \\"recent tectonic movements occurred in the upper part of Tertiary (Neogene) and in the Quaternary, which played an essential role in the origin of the contemporary topography\\". Since then geologists have disagreed as to how far back to date \\"geologically recent\\" time, with the common meaning being that neotectonics is the youngest, not yet finished stage in Earth tectonics. Some authors consider neotectonics to be basically synonymous with \\"active tectonics\\", while others date the start of the neotectonic period from the middle Miocene. A general agreement has started to emerge that the actual time-frame may be individual for each geological environment and it must be set back in time sufficiently far to fully understand the current tectonic activity.Eduard A. Koster (2005) \\"The Physical Geography of Western Europe\\", , Ch. 2: Neotectonics In 1989 Spyros B. Pavlides suggested the definition: > \\"Neotectonics is the study of young tectonic events which have occurred or > are still occurring in a given region after its orogeny or after its last > significant tectonic set-up [...] The tectonic events are recent enough to > permit a detailed analysis by differentiated and specific methods, while > their results are directly compatible with seismological observations.\\" Many researchers have accepted this approach. The Center for Neotectonic Studies at the University of Nevada, Reno defines neotectonics as > ‚Äúthe study of geologically recent motions of the Earth's crust, particularly > those produced by earthquakes, with the goals of understanding the physics > of earthquake recurrence, the growth of mountains, and the seismic hazard > embodied in these processes.‚Äù One source of different interpretations for a region stems from the fact that changes in different tectonic plates of the region may occur at different times, giving rise to the notion of the \\"transitional time\\", during which both palaeotectonic and neotectonic features coexist. For example, for central/northern Europe, the transitional period stretches from the middle early Miocene to the Miocene-Pliocene boundary.A.

After service as a commando in the Thai Border Patrol Police Parachute Aerial Resupply Unit, he went to work as a civilian with Air America during the Laotian Civil War; his job was to parachute pallets of food and supplies out of a cargo plane to aid the refugees. On 5 September 1963, he was a member of a Curtiss C-46 Commando air crew shot down near Ban Houei Sane, Laos. He was held in nine jungle prisons while the Vietnam War officially began. After two escape attempts, including one spell of 32 days spent starving in the jungle, he was still struggling to flee when rescued by the Ban Naden raid of 5 January 1967. He returned to work for Air America until they departed from Southeast Asia. After working for a Bangkok company, he retired there. Background Phisit Intharathat trained and served as a paratrooper in his native Thailand's Border Patrol Police. Members of James William Lair's Police Aerial Resupply Unit received Special forces training as commandos. After that experience, he found employment with Air America as a cargo handler on refugee relief missions dropping rice and other supplies into the Kingdom of Laos. On 4 September 1963, as part of Laotian Civil War operations, he was scheduled to fly such missions the following day with his usual flight crew on a Curtiss C-46 Commando. One of them had a hunch that he should not fly this schedule; he resigned that night. Prasit Thanee replaced him the following morning. Later, upon the death of his mother, Intharathat wrote an account of this flight and his imprisonment.Phisit Intharathat, \\"Prisoner In Laos: A Story Of Survival-Parts I and II\\", Smokejumpers Magazine, October and November 2006. Retrieved 1 December 2014. Mission On 5 September 1963, Phisit took off from Vientiane on a flight to Savannakhet Province in Laos, with fellow Thais Prasit Promsuwan and Prasit Thanee, Chinese Y.C. To, and Americans Eugene DeBruin, Joseph C. Cheney and Charles Herrick. At Savannakhet Airport, they loaded up and took off for their resupply drop near Ban Houei Sane, Laos. On their second drop, a 300 kilo sack of rice struck the left tail fin on its way to the ground. After a nervous return flight, mechanics checked the aircraft for damage, and passed it as safe to fly. By this time, it was nearly 16:00. The crew loaded up; they had time enough for their third and final drop before sunset. Phisit notes it was a routine day, no different from others of his thousands of flying hours in Laos. During this flight, about ten minutes shy of the drop zone, while flying at 8,000 feet, the C-46 was hit by antiaircraft fire and its right engine caught fire. Because Phisit was an experienced parachutist, he hurried to help inexperienced crew members bail out of the stricken plane. DeBruin, Y.C. To, and the three Thai nationals parachuted to safety. Cheney and Herrick were killed in the crash. Capture Because Phisit bailed out last, after failing to convince Cheney and Herrick to abandon the C-46's controls, he left the falling plane at a lower altitude than the others. He could see the others above him, drifting toward \\"a plain\\". He ended his 80th parachute jump when he landed in a tree just shy of 16:30. Although he was suffering from a knee injury, he was optimistic about help because combat search and rescue was available until 18:00. He moved from the crash site, going about 100 meters into the jungle. He bandaged his knee while hiding in a tree. At 17:45, four Royal Lao Air Force AT-6s flew over his abandoned parachute before turning away from ground fire. It began to rain. Later, he saw and heard a platoon of soldiers; they spoke both Lao and Vietnamese. When they located Phisit's parachute, they spread out to search for him. In turn, Phisit sneaked off down a lightly used trail, moving through increasing rain and oncoming dusk. After circling a hamlet containing enemy soldiers, he took to a creek, riding a log downstream. Unfortunately, he floated down upon a bonfire on the bank; five hostile local villagers sat next to it. Two of them detained him at musket point until Pathet Lao soldiers arrived. They tied his hands behind his back and led him by a noose around his neck. He was reunited with his four friends from the flight crew, and they began their imprisonment. Phisit spent the next three years, four months, and four days in a series of nine jungle prisons. Prisons and escapes=Prison number one After about 08:00 on 6 September, the three Thai prisoners were beaten and asked inconsequential questions. They were then marched down Route 9 and locked in an old building surrounded by a brick wall. The air crew was held there 27 days on two meals per day chased by a cup of water. Here Phisit cleaned the severe infection out of his knee wound with a sharpened bamboo splinter. Prison number two After a three-day march down Route 9, the air crew was locked into an unshaded tin-roofed cubicle. They continued to be fed two cups of sticky rice daily. In desperation, they killed and ate a snake and the two mice it was swallowing. After a month, all the prisoners suffered from dysentery. They spent three months in this jail. Muang Ang Kham Prison Phisit and the others were marched five hours to the next prison, which was near the Vietnamese border. Here they were confined in a log jail while locked in stocks. Three bamboo watchtowers guarded the premises. Although this camp was cleaner because it was on a stream bank, the guards here tied ropes around the prisoners' necks when they slept. Phisit scrounged a piece of metal from which he improvised a small knife; with this, he jiggered the stocks so the prisoners could remove them when the guards were not watching. The prisoners began considering escape. Lang Khang Prison In mid-February 1964, the prisoners were taken down Route 9, and veered into the jungle. During their five-day march, they passed North Vietnamese road construction. Lang Khang Prison was fenced, with tall guard towers. Here the prisoners were handcuffed as well as stocked. In desperation, the Thais began devouring insects and small animals to survive. After a period of reluctance, Y. C. To and Eugene DeBruin joined in. Y. C. To began keeping a hidden calendar. By now, each of the men had lost about 10 kilos weight over five months captivity despite a policy of eating grasshoppers, crickets, and lizards. =First escape= As the guards relaxed their vigilance, Phisit cobbled up a makeshift pick for the handcuffs out of an old toothpaste tube. The prisoners loosened a log in the roof of their cell. On the night of 28 May 1964, the five prisoners crept out past a guard sleeping on the edge of the roof. Sliding through the unguarded fence, they headed west toward Thailand. Pursued for six days, reduced to drinking their own urine and to licking dew from jungle leaves, they were finally caught at a waterhole. They suffered beatings and were tortured with ant bites before being returned to Lang Khang. On 22 August 1964, they were given a parcel sent to them by Air America for Christmas 1963. The next day, they were moved. Prison number five The prisoners were trucked away the next morning to Ban Pha Tang. From Ban Pha Tang, the captives marched five days to a cave filled with long-term prisoners. They stayed there three weeks. Prison number six After a day's walk, the five were incarcerated in a brand new prison at Ban Tham. Located near this large village in a mountain defile under heavy foliage, it had watch towers at two corners of the compound. The prisoners daily discussed escape, and concluded their first attempt had failed because they escaped during the dry season. They decided to try again during the rainy season. At one point, they were given four scorched decaying dog's legs to eat. After two weeks, they were returned to their previous prison. Prison number five redux They were returned to their former cell. After bathing and receiving their first haircuts in more than a year, they were given clean uniforms and interrogated in Lao, Thai, and English with French overtones. Their claims of civilian status were disbelieved because they had parachuted. They were beaten and threatened with death; Phisit's right hand was broken with a rifle butt. Eventually, all five prisoners signed bogus confessions; Phisit swore he invaded Laos on orders of the Royal Thai Government. At the end of their questioning, they were returned to prison number six at Ban Tham. Pa Kuen Prison On 4 March 1965, the prisoners were moved to confinement that Phisit called \\"...cruelest of them all.\\" It was so shaded by trees it was sunless. It swarmed with insects. Rations were cut to one tiny meal per day; drinking water was limited. They seemed to suffer more frequent malaria attacks there. Aircraft were constantly overhead; bombing and antiaircraft fire was often heard. Frightened guards took revenge by beating the captives. On 3 December 1965, the captured air crew was joined by American aviator First Lieutenant Duane W. Martin,who had been shot down 20 September. About 16 February 1966, Lieutenant j.g. Dieter Dengler joined the jail population. He noted that, confined as they were, they naturally began to quarrel. Ban Houei Het Prison The seven prisoners were incarcerated in Ban Houei Het Prison near Ban Naden on 1 May 1966. Their march there had taken them past massive communist military construction, including a road being bulldozed. The new compound was about 22 meters square. The seven were divided into two huts, with eight guards per unit. However, the 16 guards dined together in a communal mess. In anticipation of the now-pending rainy season, the prisoners began intense debate about escape plans. There was a split opinion whether or not to harm the guards during an escape attempt. The impatient Dengler believed the guards were fair game, but most of the others claimed the Geneva Convention allowed execution of recaptured prisoners in such cases. However, Dengler claims Phisit refused to participate in the escape plans. On the other hand, Phisit states that he favored an armed escape, based on his prior breakout. With food becoming scarcer for all hands, including guards, the warders became meaner and almost murderous. When wild game was hunted and brought into camp, the captives received only the intestines as their share of the meal. Dissension arose between the Asians and the Americans. Dengler wondered why the Asians received better treatment from the guards, and suspected collaboration. Matters were not helped by the constant nearby air strikes. At one point, a Cessna O-1 Bird Dog seemed to spot the camp, and there was fear that they had been mistaken for a supply depot, and the forward air controller would call in a bombing raid on them. After much argument, the prisoners arrived at an escape plan. Now that the guards had become careless, the captives would seize their weapons. While they hoped to simply imprison the guards, they decided to kill if they had to. An overheard plot by the warders to murder the prisoners and dump their bodies in the jungle hardened that resolve. =Second escape= On 29 June 1966, while the guards were eating, the group slipped out of their hand and foot restraints and grabbed the guard's unattended weapons. When the keepers spotted prisoners trying to escape, a shootout between the two sides ensued. Once the guards were killed or driven off, the prisoners split into three escape parties. Because Y. C. To could barely walk, he and Eugene DeBruin were going to climb over the nearest ridge and await rescue on the far side. Phisit and the other two Thais made up the second party. Dengler and Martin paired up in an attempt to walk west to the Mekong River. Martin was murdered by a Lao villager; Dengler was rescued 23 days after the breakout. Phisit split from the other two Thais. Finding an overgrown stream, he enacted his plan to float downstream during nighttime and hide when it was daylight. After four floating nights, he felt he could no longer endure the cold water; he began walking. He wandered through the jungle, sometimes in a circle, plagued by daily malaria attacks, eating tadpoles for sustenance. On day 26, he almost walked into a Vietnamese communist patrol. He spent the following two days trying to cross a North Vietnamese supply route traversed by trucks and under sporadic air attack. Failing in that, he doubled back on his tracks. On the 32nd day of his flight, he managed to cross the road, but fainted on the far side. Having been found by a Lao villager, he awoke back in captivity. Ban Naden Prison It was a three-day walk to his new prison at Ban Naden. There were a large number of prisoners from the Royal Lao Army, but no Americans or Thais. Inthrarathat was immured in a dugout cell in a cave's mouth, again locked into foot stocks. He estimated that his weight had dropped to about 41 kilos by then. He had daily fever attacks. At the four month mark, he briefly had a cellmate, who died. Nevertheless, Phisit began digging his way out. Rescue Information about this prison complex was received by Central Intelligence Agency personnel responsible for operations in Laos. They devised a rescue plan which was successfully implemented on 7 January 1967. The raid uncovered an unexpectedly large number of rescuees. Their poor physical condition led to their recovery from an impromptu helicopter landing zone in the middle of the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Phisit Intharathat was thus rescued in the Vietnam War's only successful rescue of prisoners of war, the Ban Naden raid. Phisit, normally 70 kilos in weight, weighed only 39 kilos when recovered. After debriefing, he was taken to hospital in Bangkok. As a result of his debriefing, the CIA changed its emphasis on operations in the military region where he had been held. From passive information gathering, they now moved on to ambushes, sabotage, and calls for air strikes. Aftermath There was no publicity concerning the rescue mission. The King of Laos privately commended Inthrarathat, but he received no other reward. Upon recovery, Air America retained him as their assistant manager for security until 1974. After Air America departed Southeast Asia in 1975, Inthrarathat worked in Bangkok for a Thai company before retiring. Phisit Intharathat was portrayed in films about Dieter Dengler (notably Little Dieter Needs to Fly and Rescue Dawn by director Werner Herzog). The fates of Y.C. To, Eugene DeBruin, Prasit Promsuwan and Prasit Thanee remain unknown.  See also  *Dieter Dengler *Duane W.

It is harvested for food but is also known to harbor toxins and cause damage to submerged structures such as drainage pipes. It is native in the Asia-Pacific region but has been introduced in the Caribbean, and in the waters around Japan, North America, and South America. Description Perna viridis Perna viridis ranges from in length and may occasionally reach . Its shell ends in a downward-pointing beak. The smooth periostracum is dark green, becoming increasingly brownish towards its point of attachment (umbo), where it is lighter. Younger mussels are bright green and that becomes darker as it ages. The shell's interior has a pale-blue sheen. The mussel has a large mobile foot which it uses to climb vertically should it be covered by sediments. It also produces byssus to help it attach to its substrate. Perna canaliculus and Perna perna are two similar species, native to the waters of New Zealand and Africa respectively. Habitat and distribution The Asian green mussel is found in the coastal waters of the Indo-Pacific region. However the mussels are introduced to other areas as an invasive species via boat hulls and water ballasts. The mussel inhabits estuarine habitats and is found in densities as high as 35,000 individuals per square meter on any submerged marine object. Although vivid green in appearance, the mussels are shrouded with overgrowth and are often hard to find. The mussels live in waters that are with a wide-ranging salinity of about 18-33 ppt. P. viridis grows fastest at below the surface, in high salinity and a high concentration of phytoplankton, although it can tolerate a range of salinity and turbid water. Ecology and life history A group of Perna viridis attached on a rocky substrate The Asian green mussel has separate sexes and fertilizes externally. There are a very few functional hermaphrodites (<0.1%). The mussel's sexual development was shown to be affected by temperature. Spawning ordinarily occurs twice a year between early spring and late autumn; however, the mussels found in the Philippines and Thailand are known to spawn all year round. The zygote transforms to a larva 7‚Äì8 hours after fertilization. The larvae stay in the water column for 10‚Äì12 days before undergoing metamorphosis into a juvenile and settling onto a surface. The juveniles become sexually mature when they are in length, a size reached within 2‚Äì3 months. Growth is influenced by the availability of food, temperature, water movement, the mussel's age, and caging. Cage culturing can prevent entry of predators and barnacles increases marketability but slows down the mussel's growth rate. The adult can live to up 2‚Äì3 years. Due to its fast growth, it can outcompete other fouling organisms and cause changes in marine ecological relationships. This mussel is a filter feeder that feeds on phytoplankton, zooplankton and suspended organic materials. They are eaten by fishes, crustaceans, seastars, octopuses and humans. Importance to humans Chonburi, Thailand, cutting the beards and removing barnacles from Asian green mussels P. viridis is harvested in the Indo-Pacific region as a food source due to its fast growth. However, it can harbor deadly Saxitoxin produced by the dinoflagellates that it feeds upon. It can also be used as a biomonitor to indicate pollution caused by heavy metals, organochlorides and petroleum products. Mussels that are in contaminated areas have labile lysosomal membranes due to metal-induced stress. This mussel is also notorious for clogging water pipes used by industrial complexes and fouling marine equipment. It has fouled the intake condenser tunnels of power plants in India and Florida and navigational buoys in China where their biomass has grown to up to . Chlorination of pipes and using high velocity water was shown to decrease or remove P. viridis population. However, the mussel excretes ammonia which reacts with the chlorine to form monochloramine, a weaker disinfectant than chlorine. Ammonia can also accelerate the corrosion of copper-based alloys found in the water pipes. Heat treatment is also being considered as an alternative to chlorination due to the safety and environmental concerns raised by the latter method.

She has done considerable field research among Native American peoples in the upper plains of the US and Canada, and has authored research volumes on Native American archaeology and Native American history. She is also the author of several general anthropology and archaeology textbooks. Education She attended Barnard College and Harvard University, from which she received her PhD in Anthropology. While a student at Barnard, she was influenced by James Ford, Gordon Ekholm, and Junius Bird; she worked summers at the American Museum of Natural History Anthropology Department. While at Harvard, she worked with Gordon Willey and Evon Vogt. Many of her influences have been colleagues such as David H. Kelley, Jane Kelley, Jennifer Brown, Robert L. Hall, George F. Carter and his students Stephen C. Jett and Carl Johannesen. Career Kehoe taught at the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln before teaching at Marquette University, from which she retired in 2000 as professor emeritus. She resides in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Kehoe has held offices with the American Anthropological Association (AAA), and was president of the Central States Anthropological Society (CSAS). Kehoe has studied many aspects of Native America and is a strong believer in the theoretical link between the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC) (of the Native southeastern U.S.) and Mesoamerica (Mexico and Central America). Her principal area of interest is the archaeology and cultures of the northwestern plains of the U.S. While searching for an ethnographic research topic for her dissertation, she happened upon the Saskatchewan Dakota New Tidings Ghost Dance. Kehoe has worked many years with the Blackfeet of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, an Algonquian Native American group of Browning, Montana, with whom she visits each year to study their history and culture. She has studied Native American spiritual healers (\\"medicine people\\") and worked with Piakwutch, \\"an elderly deeply respected Cree man who served his Saskatchewan Cree community...\\". She has also worked among Native Americans of Bolivia at Lake Titicaca, where she chewed coca leaves with Native women of the region. Kehoe has never been afraid to take controversial positions on archaeological issues. One of the original proponents of feminist archaeology, she coedited with Sarah Milledge Nelson one of the first collections of feminist archaeology papers, Powers of Observation in 1990. She is one of the few in the field with an expansive view of pre-Columbian transoceanic contacts, summarized in her book Traveling Prehistoric Seas. This interest led to her meeting Richard Nielsen, who asked her to advise on archaeological aspects while testing the Kensington Runestone of Minnesota, which Kehoe is satisfied was indeed not a 19th-century hoax but rather actual runic writing by members of a Scandinavian voyage to North America in the 14th century. The Kensington Runestone convinced Kehoe of a different North American history than what we've been taught for decades. She states: In her many years of teaching and writing, Kehoe has emphasized the importance of critical thinking in looking at anthropology, archaeology, and history, particularly as it pertains to Native America. She speaks of the \\"limited and biased archaeological record\\" (2007:personal communication) of the Americas and of how many archaeologists were molded by preconceptions of ancient Amerindians having been \\"savage\\" or \\"primitive\\" and incapable of having \\"real\\" civilizations in European terms. Kehoe minces few words in her distaste for such tunnel-visioned attitudes, stating, for example, \\"...the massive mounds of the Midwest, most of them larger than any prehistoric mounds in Europe, could not be accommodated in a scenario of virgin wilderness inhabited by Men-Brutes...\\" In 2016, Kehoe was honored by the Plains Anthropological Association with its Distinguished Service Award for her \\"enduring work in Anthropology and Archaeology of the Great Plains\\" (wording on plaque presented to Kehoe).

Biography Martin was born on January 2, 1940 in Denver, Colorado. Martin became a commissioned officer in the United States Air Force in 1963. In 1964, Martin completed his helicopter training. In 1965, Martin was assigned to Detachment 1 38th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron (38th ARRS), based at Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. On September 20, 1965, Captain Thomas J. Curtis, Martin, Sergeant William A. Robinson crew chief, and Pararescue Specialist (PJ) Arthur Black took off in their Kaman HH-43 Huskie BuNo 62-4510, callsign Dutchy 41 on a combat search and rescue (CSAR) mission for Essex 04, an F-105D piloted by Capt Willis E. Forby, over North Vietnam. The HH-43 was hit by ground fire and crashed in the jungle. Curtis, Robinson, and Black were all captured by the North Vietnamese Army and taken to a POW camp in North Vietnam. They were later released during Operation Homecoming. Martin, on the other hand was captured by the Pathet Lao and taken to a POW camp in Laos. There, he joined fellow prisoners Eugene DeBruin (American), Phisit Intharathat, Prasit Promsuwan, Prasit Dhanee (all Thai), and Y.C. To (Chinese). They were joined in February 1966 by Dieter Dengler. After learning that the starving Pathet Lao guards planned on killing them and staging their bodies so that the killings looked like an escape the prisoners decided to attempt an escape. On June 29, 1966, while the guards were eating, the group slipped out of their hand and foot restraints and grabbed the guard's unattended weapons. The Pathet Lao guards spotted some of the other prisoners trying to escape. Dengler fired at a machete wielding guard and Phisit Intharathat killed the other guards. Phisit, in his own account, says he killed one guard as he reached for his rifle and says three in total were killed and the rest ran away. The seven prisoners split into three groups: Phisit, and the other Thai prisoners; DeBruin stayed with To, who had been too ill to continue with the escape; Dengler and Martin headed for the Mekong River to escape to Thailand. Several days after the escape, Martin and Dengler were hiding out near an Akha village. Martin had a bout with malaria and was severely weakened. He was further demoralized when an attempt to signal a C-130 flareship that came over them produced no results. He told Dengler that he was going to die. Later that day he told Dengler that he was going to try to steal some food from the village. Dengler told him it would be suicide but accompanied him on the venture. As they neared the village, they encountered a boy playing with a dog. The boy alerted the village of their presence and a villager came running toward them with a machete. Martin knelt down on the trail with his hands clasped before him in supplication, but the man swung at Martin, first hitting him in the leg. His second swing struck Martin in the back of the neck, killing him. Dengler managed to escape back into the jungle and was rescued several weeks later. Other than Dengler, Phisit Intharathat was the only known survivor. The rest of the prisoners are still unaccounted for. In the 2007 film Rescue Dawn, which told the story from Dengler's point of view, Martin was portrayed by actor Steve Zahn.

He taught at the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry and he was a professor at the Department of Architecture at the Norwegian Institute of Technology. Biography Arne Korsmo grew up in Oslo and took his final exams during 1920. He earned a diploma from the architectural line of the Norwegian Institute of Technology in 1926. He practiced with some of Oslo's leading architects including Arnstein Arneberg and Magnus Poulsson. During 1926‚Äì27, Korsmo worked at the architectural office of Finn Bryn and Johan Ellefsen, where he first came into contact with modernism. In 1928, Korsmo started his own practice with architect Sverre Aasland (1899‚Äì1989). Several of his villas were designed and built in the years while he was in partnership with Sverre Aasland. Korsmo drew plans for 50 villas, several of which are regarded as masterpieces of Norwegian functionalism. Villa Stenersen, designed from 1937 to 1939 for the financier and art collector Rolf Stenersen, is one of Korsmo‚Äôs most well-known works. From 1935, Korsmo lectured at the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry in Oslo and was professor at the Norwegian Institute of Technology. At the same time he worked as an architect and designer, often with his second wife, designer Grete Prytz Kittelsen. Among his central mission was Norway's pavilion at the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937) and arranging Norway's participation in Milan X Triennale (1954). Among the young architects who worked in Korsmo's office during 1939 was American architect Robert Little (1919‚Äì2005) as Little noted in his biography in the American Architects Directory in 1962. In 1950, Korsmo was asked by Swiss art historian, Sigfried Giedion to lead the Norwegian group of Congr√®s International d'Architecture Moderne. The group, which was named PAGON (Progressive Architects Group Oslo, Norway), had the goal of implementing and promoting modern architecture. Other central figures in PAGON included Sverre Fehn, Geir Grung, Christian Norberg-Schulz and H√•kon Mjelva. Honors Arne Korsmo received the Houen Foundation Award in 1937 jointly with architect Sverre Aasland and in 1939 for the Havna all√© housing development.

The second warship to be named Loyalty by the Navy, AM-457 was laid down by Wilmington Boat Works Inc., Wilmington, California, 9 November 1951; launched 22 November 1953; sponsored by Mrs. William L. Horton; and commissioned 11 June 1954, Lt. E. W. Riordan in command.  First WestPac cruise  After shakedown Loyalty operated out of her home port, Long Beach, California, for the remaining months of 1954. Reclassified MSO-457 on 7 February 1955, the new minesweeper sailed on her first WestPac cruise 1 July. Operating with the U.S. 7th Fleet, Loyalty engaged in minesweeping exercises off Japan, Taiwan, and Korea before returning to Long Beach in February 1956.  Three more Far East tours of duty  From 1956 until late 1964 Loyalty sailed on three WestPac cruises; performed special operations in 1962 during the nuclear tests in the Pacific Ocean; and exercised off the California coast perfecting the techniques of modern mine warfare. She also performed sonar searches for downed aircraft. Her service with the powerful U.S. 7th Fleet was climaxed during her 1964 cruise. Following the Gulf of Tonkin incident when North Vietnamese torpedo boats attacked U.S. destroyers in international waters, Loyalty was dispatched to steam off the coast of Vietnam ready for further provocation. In 1962 - 1963, the Loyalty was one of five in a division of minesweepers that were deployed off the coast of Vietnam in the Tonkin Gulf to perform electronic countermeasures activities and to vector South Vietnamese gunboats to interdict large junks coming down the coast from North Vietnam that were suspected of providing arms and ammunition to cadres of Viet Cong operating in South Vietnam.  Vietnam operations  Returning Long Beach 7 December, the minesweeper performed mine countermeasure exercises off the west coast for the next 14 months. Sailing 7 February 1966 Loyalty steamed to the Far East to join U.S. forces assisting South Vietnam to repel Communist aggression. Following a brief stay in the Philippines, she joined operation \\"Market Time\\" patrol off the coast of Vietnam early in April. During Loyalty's first patrol, her crew boarded 348 junks, detained two and arrested 14 enemy smugglers. While the minesweeper was signalling a Junk to heave to on 6 April, she received fire from enemy positions ashore. Loyalty immediately answered this fire and silenced the hostile guns. Two days later, the versatile minesweeper knocked out a Vietcong emplacement which had been firing on a U.S. Army L-19 spotter plane. Rescuing a wounded American adviser from a junk some 2 miles off the coast on 17 April, she ended her patrol 8 days later when she arrived in Hong Kong. She was back on station off South Vietnam 12 May and resumed the task of preventing supplies getting into South Vietnam from the north. Loyalty continued as a unit of task force TF 115 through late 1968, stopping only briefly for respites in Subic Bay or Hong Kong and overhauls in her home port, Long Beach, California. Into 1969, Loyalty remained at Long Beach. Loyalty was stricken 1 July 1972 and sold for scrapping in December 1973.

OR 569 comprises part of the Beltline Highway No. 69 (see Oregon highways and routes). It is long and runs east‚Äìwest. OR 569 is not a complete beltway, though it was originally proposed as such before freeway revolts resulted in the original plan being scrapped. In March 2010, the Oregon Transportation Commission voted to rename the highway from Beltline to Randy Pap√© Beltway. This name change met much opposition. (See History below.) By April, it was finalized as the Randy Pap√© Beltline. Route description Beltline Highway, looking east, from the Gilham Road overpass OR 569 begins at a T-intersection with OR 126, on the western edge of Eugene. At first, as it heads north and east, it is an expressway, with one at-grade signalized intersection. Soon it becomes a two-lane freeway in each direction, as it crosses the northern edge of incorporated Eugene. From the highway, one sees mostly suburban housing and strip malls. At the eastern end, there is an interchange with I-5. Beltline becomes a local road at Gateway Street. The roadway continues, eventually reaching OR 528 in Springfield. One other section of the initial proposal was built. This section is the stretch of 30th Avenue between the Amazon Park neighborhood and Lane Community College‚Äîa four- lane expressway which includes two interchanges. This route does not connect directly to the existing stretch of Belt Line Road. Several enhancements to the Beltline Road have been proposed. The West Eugene Parkway, had it been built, would have intersected Beltline Road at a new interchange. Plans are underway to upgrade the interchange with the Delta Highway. The I-5 interchange was upgraded in 2008.Northwest Region- Region 2 I-5/Beltline Interchange The latter interchange was a full cloverleaf design, and was considered to be both obsolete and dangerous. To upgrade the interchange, a flyover bridge was built, eliminating the northeastern loop ramp and the weaving movements on northbound Interstate 5 and westbound Beltline Road. Construction is underway to redesign the nearby intersection with Gateway Boulevard. History The Beltline Highway was constructed by Lane County in the 1960s and transferred to state control in 1978 as Highway 69.Oregon @ aaroads.com/west - Belt Line Highway (Eugene)http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/TD/TP/docs/orhwyplan/analysis/13analysis.pdf The highway was assigned the Route 69 designation effective September 19, 2002. However, due to the sexual connotation of the number 69, sign theft would have been an issue, and the Oregon Department of Transportation wanted to sign the route to make navigation easier during the 2008 U.S. Olympic Trials, so ODOT requested that the Oregon Transportation Commission change the number to 14. At their January 25, 2007 meeting, the OTC decided to instead call the highway Route 569, which kept with the pattern used in other cases where the highway number could not be used (usually because there was already a route with that number). Signs for Route 569 were posted by August 2007. Controversy with renaming Beltline In early 2010, Oregon governor Ted Kulongoski requested that Beltline Highway be renamed for local businessman and civic leader Randy Pap√©. On March 11, the Oregon Transportation Commission approved renaming it to the Randy Pap√© Beltway. This caused a huge uproar against the decision: there was little chance for any citizen feedback, and if the plan went through around $250,000 would have been spent on sign changes. On April 13, 2010, the Lane County Board of Commissioners voted unanimously to request a suspension of any plans to rename the highway. The Oregon Transportation Commission, however, barely budged, and on April 21 settled on the name Randy Pape Beltline. Initially, to save money, only 2 signs, one at each end of the route, will be changed. Other signs will be replaced as they wear out. Opponents argued that while this proposal looks like a great deal on the surface, emails obtained from ODOT through public records request show that the renaming of the highway adds extra letters to the signs which translates into larger signs which may also require larger supports. ODOT estimated that instead of the original cost of $250,000 to replace the 53 signs that the new estimate could reach over $500,000. Opponents sought to reverse the name change and had a bit more than 1000 signatures by placing a measure on the November 2010 ballot that would require statewide voter approval to rename state-owned property but fell more than 80,000 signatures short, having had only a few days to collect them.

Peer review administered by the Society for Conservation Biology Males and females generally look alike but males are often smaller; there is color variation with yellow lines from the center of the shell to the edges through gray, red-brown, or black coloration. Besides the size, males can be distinguished from females in several ways; a large curved inner claw on the back feet, a cloacal opening that is farther back in males, a longer and thicker tail, and reddish color on the legs and occasionally on the jaw.  Distribution and temperature  The geographic distribution of the ornate box turtle includes a large part of the Midwest, from Wisconsin to the Gulf of Mexico and from Louisiana to Colorado. It was first discovered in Nebraska in 1795, where \\"vast numbers\\" were found. The turtle is usually found in grasslands and on land rather than in water; they have been found in all habitat types of the Great Plains except aquatic, though most references indicate they prefer open grass or prairie lands. Several studies indicate that the ornate box turtle needs three specific types of microhabitats in order to survive: # grass (prairie) areas for feeding that have some free water # areas where females can nest and burrow into the soil to overwinter # sites for resting and thermoregulation where turtles can bury themselves in soil to protect themselves from extreme temperatures and to avoid dehydration in summer and eat their own eggs Converse, SJ and JA Savidge, 2003. Ambient temperature, activity, and microhabitat use by ornate box turtles (Terrapene ornata ornata). J. Herpetol. 37(4):665-670.Bernstein, NP and RW Black, 2004. Thermal environment of overwintering ornate box turtles, Terrapene ornata ornata, in Iowa. Am. Midl. Nat. 153:370-377; Water is important for this turtle to regulate body temperature in hot weather and to replace body water after hibernation, but they do not spend large amounts of time in flowing or standing water. The ornate box turtle, like all reptiles, is ectothermic, which means that its body temperature is affected by the environmental temperature and the environmental temperature affects its movement.Claussen, DL, R Lim, M Kurz and K Wren, 2002. Effects of slope, substrate, and temperature on the locomotion of the ornate box turtle, Terrapene ornata. Copeia 2002(2):411-418. In the hottest part of the day, the turtle is less active because movement increases body temperature and makes it harder for the turtle to keep cool, and when the temperature is lower(dawn and dusk), the turtle is more active. Additionally, the turtles use their habitat to help control their body temperature. Shrubs are commonly utilized for the shade the plants produce, helping to further regulate the animal's temperature. Open areas of sand are also important parts of the turtle's habitat for digging holes to burrow in. In winter, ornate box turtles hibernate underground in burrows. They burrow in at about the same time in the fall and come out within 7‚Äì14 days of each other. They can survive freezing soil temperatures for many days. The depth of nest cavities in Nebraska in 1997 and 1998 was 16.8 cm and the depth of hatchlings buried in the soil ranged from 56.3 cm to 64.7 cm.Converse, SJ, JB Iverson and JA Savidge, 2002. Activity, reproduction and overwintering behavior of ornate box turtles (Terrapene ornata ornata) in the Nebraska Sandhills. Am Midl. Nat. 148:416-422. In Nebraska, winter burrows were dug after October and turtles stayed in them until April and all of these turtles were in individual burrows. The home range area of ornate box turtles varies a lot from study to study, from as small as 0.12 hectares to as large as 36.4 hectares. The large variability in home range size estimates can be affected by seasonality, body size and age, time period of observation, presence of roads or other structures, statistics used, and other factors. The ornate box turtle has a high degree of philopatry, which means that it returns to the same area year after year, and it usually prefers the same habitat type as the original one.Bernstein, NP, RJ Richtsmeier, RW Black and BR Montgomery, 2006. Home range and philopatry in the ornate box turtle, Terrapene ornata ornata, in Iowa. Am Midl. Nat. 157:162-174. Ornate box turtles were two times more likely to be found in the same sub-habitat type as the original and even more likely to be in a sub-habitat next to the original habitat than areas two sub- habitats away.  Feeding preferences  The ornate box turtle is an omnivore, with no particular dietary preferences; as an opportunistic feeder, it eats whatever is available in any given location or season. Grasses, berries, insects and other invertebrates (caterpillars, grasshoppers, beetles, earthworms), fruits, vegetables, and carrion (mammals, birds, amphibians, snakes, and even other turtles). This varied diet means the turtle has very little competition for available food resources.  Lifespan  An ornate box turtle hatchlingThe lifespan of the ornate box turtle has been reported to be from 32 to 37 years, with studies showing that males occur about half as frequently as females. The reason for the predominance of females is thought to be primarily due to temperature; incubating eggs at 29 ¬∞C (84 ¬∞F) produces 100% female offspring, so in the wild a combination of temperature, humidity, and other factors are thought to favor female differentiation. Birds, such as crows, raptors, and ravens; domestic cats and dogs; opossums; raccoons; skunks; snakes; and even adult box turtles; are potential predators of young turtles. The turtle has very little means of self-defense other than closing the shell, though they may potentially bite if handled. Until recently, there was very little scientific knowledge of diseases and parasites among the turtle populations; early studies showed that a genus of fly sometimes infested the legs of these turtles and caused death by starvation because their movement was impeded. More recently, it has been found that respiratory, metabolic, and shell diseases, common in desert tortoises, also fairly common in land turtles such as the ornate box turtle; and that nutritional deficiencies contribute to these other diseases. The age of ornate box turtles has been estimated by counting growth rings for many years. This is similar to estimating the age of a tree but for turtles, the \\"rings\\" are lines that form on part of the shell that are like scales and the longer a turtle lives, the more rings are formed. However, using the rings to estimate age is not always reliable.Wilson, DS, CR Tracy and CR Tracy, 2003. Estimating age of turtles from growth rings: A critical evaluation of the technique. Herpetologica 59(2):178-194. The shell does increase in size as turtles get older, even though its weight makes it heavy to carry around.Miller, K and GF Birchard, 2005. Influence of body size on shell mass in the ornate box turtle, Terrapene ornata. J. Herpetol. 39(1):158-161. Threats to the ornate box turtle= Intrinsic threats ‚Äì natural occurrences and factors relating to the turtle itself Because of its late reproductive age, low reproductive rate, high young mortality, and long lifespan, the ornate box turtle is subject to pressure from intrinsic factors that limit the population growth. Young turtles are vulnerable to predation until the shell is strong enough to be a major protection (except from being run over by cars). The loss of any older females is a problem, because they do not get replaced very fast. Climatic factors are also possible threats to the ornate box turtle. Because the sex of turtles is strongly influenced by temperature, the sex ratio can be changed by climatic extremes and result in a population that is mostly all one sex for several years in a row. This gender imbalance would affect the survival of small groups that would be threatened by the occurrence of a genetic bottleneckKuo, C and FJ Janzen, 2004. Genetic effects of a persistent bottleneck on a natural population of ornate box turtles (Terrapene ornata). Conserv. Genetics 5:425-437. which means the gene pool would be too small and cause inbreeding and mortality. The bottleneck effect is a double-edged sword for species that live a long time because the loss of genetic diversity would not be as obvious or as severe, but once it occurred, it would be harder to recover. The other thing about the ornate box turtle's life history that is a problem for its survival is its home range philopatry, which means that it returns to the same area every time and so disruptions in the area make it more vulnerable. Extrinsic threats ‚Äì human effects on the ornate box turtle The ornate box turtle is a terrestrial turtle and terrestrial turtles are sensitive to human causes such as habitat destruction, introduced species, harvest or collection, pollution, and climate change.Converse, SJ, JB Iverson and JA Savidge, 2005. Demographics of an ornate box turtle population experiencing minimal human-induced disturbances. Ecological Appl., 15(6):2171-2179. Agriculture ‚Äì agriculture in the Great Plains has been the worst problem for the ornate box turtle recently because it has taken away many acres of land, destroyed habitat, caused more traffic, and created small, isolated areas of prairie. In addition, the small pieces of prairie mean more edge habitats, which causes more predators to live there and that increases predation of the box turtle that is already suffering from less total habitat area. Other agricultural factors that are a problem for the ornate box turtle are fences, water troughs, cattle (trampling), mowing, and other machinery. Development ‚Äì houses and other building construction causes loss of habitat similar to agriculture, but also increased removal for pets, predation by dogs, and greater predation to crows and raccoons that increase around human living areas. Where housing developments are built, there are also more roads. The box turtle feeds on carrion when it is available and on roads road-kill is a large source of carrion and a large cause of death of ornate box turtles. Over-exploitation ‚Äì very many ornate box turtles have been collected for sale in pet stores, and individuals have always collected some turtles. The commercial trade has had a large effect on the Great Plains populations and if it continues, the result will be a serious decline in turtles.  Conservation efforts  According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the ornate box turtle is \\"near threatened.\\" In some states, such as Nebraska, Kansas, and Colorado, the turtle is \\"secure\\"; but in South Dakota, it is listed as \\"imperiled\\"; and in Wyoming it is listed as \\"critically imperiled.\\" Management decisions for the ornate box turtle are difficult because of life history factors. It seems that the best strategies will be aimed at older females to increase their survival instead of concentrating on hatchlings and juvenile turtles. One of the first things that needs to be done is to get a better idea of the actual number of ornate box turtles that exist and also to make it illegal to collect any for pet or commercial trade, as some states did. Along with this is the need to stop the release of captive box turtles that have respiratory infections into the wild because of the effect of disease on survival. Management techniques that preserve the best habitat composition are important conservation practices. Probably the biggest factor that affects the ornate box turtle is interactions with human so any action that minimizes contact is helpful. Working to keep large areas of habitat undisturbed is also helpful. Managing weeds with a minimal amount of herbicide and knowing what chemicals are in the herbicide and how they affect turtles is important. The use of fire and mowing to control weeds should be done carefully when turtles are inactive or in burrows to keep cool. The public is not likely to want to stop collecting turtles, even if the pet trade were prohibited, because people like to look at turtles and other forms of nature. Nebraska and Louisiana have prohibited collecting ornate box turtles, but New Mexico and Texas have not. Educating the public about the risks to the ornate box turtle will be difficult but should be part of the conservation effort. One conservation effort that might be helpful is removal of predators from an area where many turtles are found; one study found that removing raccoons was helpful but it also leads to the question of balance in nature and which animals are more important. Some biologists have suggested that moving turtles from healthy populations to areas where the turtle is struggling might be an option but this is difficult and might be a last resort. Habitat loss is the biggest problem for the ornate box turtleBowen, KD, PL Colbert and FJ Janzen, 2004.

Doran Memorial Bridge in 1969 after a Hillsborough police officer who was killed in the line of duty on August 5, 1959. It was rededicated the Officer Eugene A. Doran and Marine Lance Corporal Patrick M. Doran Memorial Bridge in 2004 to include Patrick Doran, Eugene's son, who died in Vietnam on February 18, 1967. History=Design The house was designed by architect William Nicholson and built in 1976 as one of several experimental domed buildings using new materials. It was constructed by spraying shotcrete onto steel rebar and wire mesh frames over inflated aeronautical balloons. It has approximately of living space including three bedrooms, one accessed via a spiral staircase inspired by an icecream cone that at the top is the same diameter as the room, and two bathrooms, and has a two-car garage. All the interior surfaces are rounded, and the master bathroom has a floor of rocks instead of tiles. Originally off- white in color, the house was repainted deep orange in 2000, and one of the domes was later painted purple. Nicknames The house is known popularly as \\"The Flintstone House\\", from The Flintstones, a Hanna-Barbera Productions animated cartoon series of the early 1960s about a Stone Age family. It is also known as the Dome House, the Gumby House, the Worm Casting House, the Bubble House, and \\"The Barbapapa House\\", from Barbapapa, a character and series of books created by Annette Tison and Talus Taylor in the 1970s.  Disrepair, restoration and remodeling  By the mid-1980s the house had fallen into disrepair, as water runoff from higher on the mountainside damaged the foundation, causing the walls to crack. After failed attempts at sealing the cracks, it was extensively restored in 1987. San Francisco Bay Area architect Eugene Tsui undertook to remodel the house during the first decade of the 2000s. The results of Tsui's remodel appear as the \\"Edises Kitchen\\" project, pictured on Tsui's website.Eugene Tsui's \\"completed projects\\" slide show. Tsui's original concept for the remodel, including a proposed complementary second residence on the property, is detailed in depth on his earlier site.Architect Eugene Tsui's original concept for the mid-2000s remodel. In late 2017, new owners installed large oxidized steel sculptures of dinosaurs, a woolly mammoth, a giraffe, and Fred Flintstone in the yard. Complaint The house was unpopular with some neighbors, and inspired the formation of a local architectural review board. In March 2019, the town of Hillsborough filed a complaint against the current owner of the house, Florence Fang. The complaint alleges that the current owner's modifications are a \\"public nuisance\\" and that she did not receive the proper permits for her modifications. In March 2019, Fang retained the law offices of former San Francisco Mayor Joseph L. Alioto and Angela Alioto to respond to the Hillsborough Complaint.Article in The Guardian with many 2019 images File:FlintstoneHouse.jpgalt= View of The Flintstone House from Doran Memorial Bridge on Interstate 280 (July 2007).View of The Flintstone House from Doran Memorial Bridge on Interstate 280 (July 2007).

Sandeshkhali I CD Block is part of the North Bidyadhari Plain, one of the three physiographic regions in the district located in the lower Ganges Delta. The area is full of marshes and salt water lakes. The Bidyadhari has a long course through the central part of the district. The wide Dalma and Besti rivers flow through the area. Sandeshkhali I CD Block has an area of 182.30 km2. It has 1 panchayat samity, 8 gram panchayats, 99 gram sansads (village councils), 30 mouzas and 30 inhabited villages. Nazat police station serves this block. Headquarters of this CD Block is at Nazat. Gram panchayats of Sandeshkhali I block/ panchayat samiti are: Bayermari I, Kalinagar, Sarberia Agarhati, Bayermari II, Nazat I, Sehera Radhanagar, Hatgachhi and Nazat II. Sundarbans The Sundarbans is a flat lowland susceptible to storm surges along the 260 km shoreline of the Bay of Bengal. The total expanse of Sundarbans is about 2.05 million hectares (8,000 square miles). Of this, only 0.42 million hectares (1,629 square miles or 10,43,000 acres) are under the reserve forests including about 0.19 million hectares covered by creeks and channels. The area is prone to natural calamities such as cyclones, thunderstorms with occasional hail and floods. There are more than 63,400 km of embankments but the floods caused by high tidal bores, often wash away much of the embankments, already weakened and broken by earlier cyclonic storms. In May 2009, the district was hit by high speed cyclone named Aila and subsequent rainfall which continued for two days. This created a disaster in 20 out of 22 blocks of the district. 10 out of 27 municipalities of the district were also severely affected. Six CD Blocks of North 24 Parganas are included in the Sundabans area ‚Äì Hingalganj, Hasnabad, Sandeskhali I and II, Minakhan and Haora. The south-eastern part of the district gradually merges into the Sunderbans. Demographics=Population As per 2011 Census of India Sandeshkhali I CD Block had a total population of 164,465, all of which were rural. There were 83,925 (51%) males and 80,540 (49%) females. Population below 6 years was 22,394. Scheduled Castes numbered 50,812 (30.90%) and Scheduled Tribes numbered 42,674 (25.95%). As per 2001 census, Sandeshkhali I block has a total population of 140,446 out of which 71,912 were males and 68,534 were females.

North 24 Parganas district is densely populated, mainly because of the influx of refugees from East Pakistan (later Bangladesh). With a density of population of 2,182 per km2 in 1971, it was 3rd in terms of density per km2 in West Bengal after Kolkata and Howrah, and 20th in India. According to the District Human Development Report: North 24 Parganas, ‚ÄúHigh density is also explained partly by the rapid growth of urbanization in the district. In 1991, the percentage of urban population in the district has been 51.23.‚Äù Decadal Population Growth Rate (%) The decadal growth of population in Sandeshkhali I CD Block in 2001-2011 was 17.08%.

See also - North 24 Parganas: minority concentrated district Rural Poverty 59.70% of households in Sandeshkhali I CD Block lived below poverty line in 2001, against an average of 29.28% in North 24 Parganas district. Crime Sandeshkhali and its surrounding areas are known for ‚Äúnotorious activities and incidents of common people being attacked and robbed by pirates frequently‚Äù. Some localities close to Sundarbans have been found vulnerable to women trafficking. More than 100 women from this region get trafficked to red-light areas in Mumbai and Pune each year. Over the period 2002 - 2007, Sandeshkhali has reported hundreds of missing boys and girls. Most affected families have not registered cases, as they feel the police will not be of much help. Many keep on hoping that their children will return someday. Save The Children, a self-help group run by a non-governmental organisation has done yeomen service in the area. Economy=Livelihood In Sandeshkhali I CD Block in 2011, amongst the class of total workers, cultivators numbered 8,503 and formed 13.94% of the total workers, agricultural labourers numbered 27,851 and formed 45.65%, household industry workers numbered 2,392 and formed 3.92% and other workers numbered 22,259 and formed 36.49%. Total workers numbered 61,005 and formed 37.09% of the total population, and non-workers numbered 103,460 and formed 62.91% of the population. In more than 30 percent of the villages in North 24 Parganas, agriculture or household industry is no longer the major source of livelihood for the main workers there. The CD Blocks in the district can be classified as belonging to three categories: border areas, Sundarbans area and other rural areas. The percentage of other workers in the other rural areas category is considerably higher than those in the border areas and Sundarbans area. Note: In the census records a person is considered a cultivator, if the person is engaged in cultivation/ supervision of land owned by self/government/institution. When a person who works on another person‚Äôs land for wages in cash or kind or share, is regarded as an agricultural labourer. Household industry is defined as an industry conducted by one or more members of the family within the household or village, and one that does not qualify for registration as a factory under the Factories Act. Other workers are persons engaged in some economic activity other than cultivators, agricultural labourers and household workers. It includes factory, mining, plantation, transport and office workers, those engaged in business and commerce, teachers, entertainment artistes and so on. Infrastructure There are 30 inhabited villages in Sandeshkhali I CD Block. 100% villages have power supply and drinking water supply. 17 villages (56.67%) have post offices. 24 villages (80.00%) have telephones (including landlines, public call offices and mobile phones). 18 villages (60.00%) have a pucca approach road and 18 villages (60.00%) have transport communication (includes bus service, rail facility and navigable waterways). 1 village (3.33%) has an agricultural credit society and 5 villages (16.67% ) have banks. Power The remote villages and hamlets situated in the area suffer from chronic shortage of energy due to non-availability of grid power. It is extremely difficult to extend high voltage transmission lines because of technical limitations in an area with inhospitable terrain and prohibitive cost. A scheme is being formulated to cover about 750,000 people in the difficult areas of Sundarbans with non-conventional energy power within the year 2012. The scheme covers Gosaba, Sagar, Pathar Pratima, Namkhana, Kultali, Hingalganj and Sandeshkhali. Agriculture The North 24 Parganas district Human Development Report opines that in spite of agricultural productivity in North 24 Parganas district being rather impressive 81.84% of rural population suffered from shortage of food. With a high urbanisation of 54.3% in 2001, the land use pattern in the district is changing quite fast and the area under cultivation is declining. However, agriculture is still the major source of livelihood in the rural areas of the district. From 1977 on wards major land reforms took place in West Bengal. Land in excess of land ceiling was acquired and distributed amongst the peasants. Following land reforms land ownership pattern has undergone transformation. In 2010-11, persons engaged in agriculture in Sandeshkhali I CD Block could be classified as follows: bargadars 7,654 (11.80%), patta (document) holders 13,843 (21.35%), small farmers (possessing land between 1 and 2 hectares) 2,730 (4.21%), marginal farmers (possessing land up to 1 hectare) 21,430 (33.05%) and agricultural labourers 19,181 (29.58%). Sandeshkhali I CD Block had 15 fertiliser depots, 9 seed stores and 40 fair price shops in 2010-11. In 2010-11, Sandeshkhali I CD Block produced 1,412 tonnes of Aman paddy, the main winter crop from 834 hectares. There were no irrigation facilities in Sandeshkhali I CD Block in 2010-11. Pisciculture In 2010-11, the net area under effective pisciculture in Sandeshkhali I CD Block was 5,730.18 hectares. 11,413 persons were engaged in the profession. Approximate annual production was 171,905.4 quintals. Banking In 2010-11, Sandeshkhali I CD Block had offices of 4 commercial banks and 1 gramin bank. Micro-credit Micro credit is serving as an effective tool of economic emancipation of women, empowering them to fight against many social evils and the age-old atrocities in the villages. JYDC an NGO, in collaboration with National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has established 1047 self-help groups with 12000 members spread over 24 villages (mouza).

Education In 2010-11, Sandeshkhali I CD Block had 87 primary schools with 12,272 students, 2 middle schools with 516 students, 6 high schools with 3,652 students and 6 higher secondary schools with 5,440 students. Sandeshkhali I CD Block had 1 general college with 1,273 students and 409 institutions for special and non-formal education with 16,616 students. Kalinagar Mahavidyalaya was established at Kalinagar, PS Sandeshkhali, in 1985.

Healthcare In 2011, Sandeshkhali I CD Block had 1 block primary health centre and 2 primary health centres, with total 23 beds and 4 doctors (excluding private bodies). It had 35 family welfare subcentres. 1,668 patients were treated indoor and 83,016 patients were treated outdoor in the hospitals, health centres and subcentres of the CD Block. Ghoshpur Rural Hospital at Ghoshpur with 30 beds functions as the main medical facility in Sandeshkhali I CD Block. There are primary health centres at Agarbati (Hatgachia PHC with 10 beds) and Nazat (with 6 beds). Although in North 24 Parganas district groundwater is affected by arsenic contamination, tubewells in Sandeshkhali II block are arsenic safe according to Indian standard (50 ¬µg/L) and in Sandeshkhali I block only 0.6% tubewells exceed 50 ¬µg/L.(study conducted by JYDC an NGO). A lab was set up by JYDC in collaboration with UNICEF and govt. of West Bengal to monitor drinking water in the area. The probable reason may be, in Sandeshkhali, most of the tubewells are deep tubewells. A study of iodine deficiency disorder amongst children found that prevalence of goitre amongst school children was very high at Sandeshkhali. Four launches with doctors carrying medicines, sophisticated portable X-ray and echo-cardiograph machines, provided by the French author Dominique Lapierre move along the waterways of the Sundarbans to its furthest corners.

He last played as a goalkeeper for Al-Talaba and the Iraq national team. His older brother Wissam Kassid is also a goalkeeper, and plays for Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya. Club career Kadhim played one season for Shabab Al-Karkh before joining Al-Naft. He then secured a move in 2005 to Al Shorta. In 2010, he joined Iraqi Super league rivels Arbil FC along with club teammate Mustafa Ahmad In 2012, Mohammed re- joined Al Shorta, where he won two consecutive Iraqi league trophies. International career Although, playing second to first-choice goalkeeper Noor Sabri, Mohammed Kassid has shown himself to be more than capable of becoming No 1. Born in December 1982, Kassid started his career inspired by older brother Wissam Kassid, who keeps goal for Iraqi club Al Quwa Al Jawiya. Like Wissam, Mohammed quickly found fame as a talented keeper and his talent was soon discovered by Bagdad-based club Al Karkh, where he cut his teeth as a teenager between 2003 and 2004. After spending a year with Al Naft, he then moved to another capital-based club, six-time Iraqi champions Al Shorta, making 36 appearances for the senior side in three seasons. Kassid's excellent displays at club level didn't go unnoticed and he was involved with both the Iraqi U-17 and U-20 sides before earning promotion to the Olympic squad charged with qualifying for Beijing 2008, where he made the No1 shirt his own. It was no surprise when he broke into the national senior side under Brazilian coach Jorvan Vieira, who guided the team to the title at the 2007 AFC Asian Cup. Although he was left warming the bench while Sabri excelled throughout Iraq's triumphant campaign, Kassid didn't spend his time merely watching. The lessons he learned from Sabri's heroics benefited his own development and, in the FIFA Confederations Cup South Africa 2009, he started for his country in all three games, conceding just one goal and ranking amongst the best players in the tournament statistically (by virtue of the Castrol index). He was also selected as the second best goalkeeper in Confederations Cup 2009.

It is a sometimes an erect shrub, sometimes sprawling to almost prostrate. It has linear leaves and very feathery flowers in spring. The flowers are usually cream-coloured or white, becoming pinkish and reddish or maroon as the flowers age, giving a variegated appearance to the display. Description Verticordia huegelii is a shrub which grows to high but sometimes has a sprawling habit. Its leaves are linear to club- shaped, semi-circular in cross-section and long. The flowers are unscented and arranged in rounded groups near the ends of the branches, each flower on a stalk long. The floral cup is top-shaped, long, smooth and partly hairy. The sepals are cream-coloured to yellow or reddish, long and lack lobes but are deeply divided with spreading hairs, some of which are longer and more prominent than others. The petals are white, cream or yellow and turn reddish, more or less round and spreading, with a fringe of hairs around their edge and long. The style is straight, long, hairy around its upper part and has a prominent cap-like stigma on its tip. Flowering time is mostly from September to November, but varies to a degree depending on the variety. Taxonomy and naming Verticordia huegelii was first formally described by Stephan Endlicher in 1837 and the description was published in Enumeratio plantarum quas in Novae Hollandiae ora austro-occidentali ad fluvium Cygnorum et in sinu Regis Georgii collegit Carolus Liber Baro de H√ºgel from specimens collected by Charles von H√ºgel near the Swan River in 1833. The specific epithet (huegelii) commemorates Hugel, the collector of the type specimen. In his 1991 revision of the genus Verticordia, Alex George recognised four varieties: * Verticordia huegelii Endl. var. huegelii which is an upright shrub with flowers that are cream, pale yellow or white when they open and have narrow egg-shaped, finely fringed staminodes; * Verticordia huegelii var. decumbens A.S.George which is an almost prostrate shrub but otherwise similar to var. huegelii; * Verticordia huegelii var. stylosa (Turcz.) A.S.George which is similar to var. huegelii but has flowers which are greenish-yellow when they first open; * Verticordia huegelii var. tridens A.S.George which has linear to gradually tapering staminodes, in contrast with those of the other varieties. In the same review, George placed this species in subgenus Verticordia, section Pilocosta along with V. brachypoda and V. multiflora. Distribution and habitat This verticordia grows in sand and clay, often with granite, laterite or sandstone and usually in association with other verticordia species. Distribution depends on subspecies but in general it occurs from Geraldton south to the Porongurup National Park and inland as far as Wongan Hills in the Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest, Swan Coastal Plain, Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions. Conservation Verticordia huegelii var. tridens is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat.

A Winter's Tale () is a satirical epic poem by the German writer Heinrich Heine (1797‚Äì1856), describing the thoughts of a journey from Paris to Hamburg the author made in winter 1843. The title refers to Shakespeare's Winter's Tale, similar to his poem Atta Troll: Ein Sommernachtstraum (\\"Atta Troll: A Midsummer Night's Dream\\"), written 1841‚Äì46. This poem was immediately censored in most of Germany, but ironically it became one of the reasons for Heine's growing fame.  Original publication  From the onset of the (Metternich) Restoration in Germany, Heine was no longer secure from the censorship, and in 1831 he finally migrated to France as an exile. In 1835 a decree of the German Federal Convention banned his writings together with the publications of the Young Germany literary group. At the end of 1843 Heine went back to Germany for a few weeks to visit his mother and his publisher Julius Campe in Hamburg. On the return journey the first draft of Deutschland. Ein Winterm√§rchen took shape. The verse epic appeared in 1844 published by Hoffmann and Campe, Hamburg. According to the censorship regulations of the 1819 Carlsbad Decrees, manuscripts of more than twenty folios did not fall under the scrutiny of the censor. Therefore, Deutschland. Ein Winterm√§rchen was published together with other poems in a volume called ‚ÄòNew Poems‚Äô. However, on 4 October 1844 the book was banned and the stock confiscated in Prussia. On 12 December 1844, King Frederick William IV issued a warrant of arrest against Heine. In the period following the work was repeatedly banned by the censorship authorities. In other parts of Germany it was certainly issued in the form of a separate publication, also published by Hoffmann and Campe, but Heine had to shorten and rewrite it. Ironically, censorship of Heine's works, particularly of the Winter Tale, became a major reason for Heine's raising fame.  Contents  Schmitten, Hesse The opening of the poem is the first journey of Heinrich Heine to Germany since his emigration to France in 1831. However it is to be understood that this is an imaginary journey, not the actual journey which Heine made but a literary tour through various provinces of Germany for the purposes of his commentary. The 'I' of the narrative is therefore the instrument of the poet's creative imagination. Winterm√§rchen and Winterreise Heinrich Heine was a master of the natural style of lyrics on the theme of love, like those in the 'Lyrisches Intermezzo' of 1822-1823 in Das Buch der Lieder (1827) which were set by Robert Schumann in his Dichterliebe. A few of his poems had been set by Franz Schubert, not least for the great posthumously-collected series of songs known as the Schwanengesang. In such works Heine assumed the manner of Wilhelm M√ºller, whose son Professor Max M√ºller later emphasizedFranz Schubert, Sammlung der Lieder kritisch revidirt von Max Friedlaender, Vol 1., Preface by F. Max M√ºller (Edition Peters, Leipzig) the fundamentally musical nature of these poems and the absolute congruity of Schubert's settings of them, which are fully composed duos for voice and piano rather than merely 'accompaniments' to tunes. Yet Heine's work addressed political preoccupations with a barbed and contemporary voice, whereas M√ºller's melancholy lyricism and nature-scenery explored more private (if equally universal) human experience. Schubert's Heine settings hardly portray the poet-philosopher's full identity. Schubert was dead by 1828: Heine's choice of the winter journey theme certainly alludes to the Winterreise, M√ºller's cycle of poems about lost love, which in Schubert's song-cycle of the same name became an immortal work embodying some more final and tragic statement about the human condition. Winterreise is about the exile of the human heart, and its bitter and gloomy self-reconciliation. Deutschland. Ein Winterm√§rchen transfers the theme to the international European political scene, his exile as a writer from his own homeland (where his heart is), and his Heimatssehnsucht or longing for the homeland. Thus Heine casts his secret and 'illegal thoughts', so that the darts of his satire and humour fly out from the tragic vortex of his own exile. The fact that Heine's poetry was itself so closely identified with Schubert was part of his armoury of 'fire and weapons' mentioned in the closing stanzas: he transformed M√ºller's lament into a lament for Germany. In Section III, full of euphoria he sets foot again on German soil, with only ‚Äòshirts, trousers and pocket handkerchiefs‚Äô in his luggage, but in his head ‚Äòa twittering birds‚Äô-nest/ of books liable to be confiscated‚Äô. In Aachen Heine first comes in contact again with the Prussian military: > These people are still the same wooden types, > Spout pedantic commonplaces - > All motions right-angled - and priggishness > Is frozen upon their faces. Unfinished Cologne Cathedral in 1856, the year of Heine's death. In Section IV on the winter-journey to Cologne he mocks the anachronistic German society, that more readily with archaic skills builds the Cologne Cathedral, unfinished since the Middle Ages, than addressing itself to the Present Age. That the anachronistic building works came to be discontinued in the course of the Reformation indicated for the poet a positive advance: the overcoming of traditional ways of thought and the end of spiritual juvenility or adolescence. In Section V he comes to the Rhine, as ‚Äòthe German Rhine‚Äô and ‚ÄòFather Rhine‚Äô, icon and memorial of German identity. The River-god however shows himself as a sorrowful old man, disgusted with the babble about Germanic identity. He does not long to go back among the French who, according to Heine, now drink beer and read ‚ÄòFichte‚Äô and Kant. Section VI introduces the ‚ÄòLiktor‚Äô, the poet's demon and ghostly doppelganger, always present, who follows him about carrying a hatchet under his cloak, waiting for a sign to execute the poet's judicial sentences. The stanzas express Heine's conviction that an idea once thought can never be lost. He confronts the shadowy figure, and is told: > In Rome an ax was carried before > A consul, may I remind you. > You too have your lictor, but nowadays > The ax is carried behind you. > I am your lictor: in the rear > You always hear the clink of > The headsman's ax that follows you. > I am the deed you think of. In Section VII the Execution begins in dream. Followed by his ‚Äòsilent attendant‚Äô the poet wanders through Cologne. He marks the doorposts with his heart‚Äôs blood, and this gives the Liktor the signal for a death-sentence. At last he reaches the Cathedral with the Three Kings Shrine, and ‚Äúsmashes up the poor skeletons of Superstition.‚Äô In Section VIII he travels further on to Hagen and M√ºlheim, places which bring to mind his former enthusiasm for Napoleon Bonaparte. His transformation of Europe had called awake in Heine the hope for universal freedom. However: the Emperor is dead. Heine had been an eye-witness in Paris of his burial in 1840 at Les Invalides. Section IX brings culinary reminiscences of ‚Äòhomely Sauerkraut‚Äô seasoned with satirical pointedness: Section X, Greetings to Westphalia. Hermannsdenkmal, Teutoburg Forest In Section XI he travels through the Teutoburg Forest and fantasizes about it, what might have happened, if Hermann of the Cherusci had not vanquished the Romans: Roman culture would have permeated the spiritual life of Germany, and in place of the ‚ÄòThree Dozen Fathers of the Provinces‚Äô should have been now at least one proper Nero. The Section is ‚Äì in disguise ‚Äì also an attack on the Culture-politics of the ‚ÄòRomantic on the Throne,‚Äô Friedrich Wilhelm IV.; then pretty well all the significant individuals in this outfit (for example Raumer, Hengstenberg, Birch-Pfeiffer, Schelling, Ma√ümann, Cornelius) lived in Berlin. Section XII contains the poet's address on the theme: ‚ÄòHowling with the wolves,‚Äô as the carriage breaks down in the forest at night, and he responds as the denizens of the forest serenade him. This Heine offers as a metaphoric statement of the critical distance occupied by himself as polemic or satirical poet, and of the sheepskin-costume appropriate for much of what was surrounding him. > I am no sheep, I am no dog, > No Councillor, and no shellfish ‚Äì > I have remained a wolf, my heart > And all my fangs are wolfish. Section XIII takes the traveller to Paderborn. In the morning mist a crucifix appears. The ‚Äòpoor jewish cousin‚Äô had even less good fortune than Heine, since the kindly Censor had at least held back from having him crucified ‚Äì until now, at any rate ... Kyffh√§user Monument In Section XIV and Section XV the poet betakes himself in a dream to another memorable place: he visits Friedrich Barbarossa in Kyffh√§user. Not surprisingly the mythic German Emperor presents himself as a man become imbecile through senility, who is above all proud of the fact that his banner has not yet been eaten by moths. Germany in internal need? Pressing need of business for an available Emperor? Wake up, old man, and take your beard off the table! What does the most ancient hero mean by it? > He who comes not today, tomorrow surely comes, > But slowly doth the oak awaken, > And ‚Äòhe who goes softly goes well*‚Äô, so runs > The proverb in the Roman kingdom. (*chi va piano va sano, Italian) Section XVI brings the Emperor to the most recent state of affairs: between the Middle Ages and Modern Times, between Barbarossa and today stands and functions the guillotine. Emperors have worn out their usefulness, and seen in that light Monarchs are also superfluous. Stay up the mountain, Old Man! Best of all, the nobility, along with that ‚Äògartered knighthood of gothic madness and modern lie,‚Äô should stay there too with you in Kyffh√§user (Section XVII). Sword or noose would do equally good service for the disposal of these superfluous toadies. Dealings with the police remain unpleasant in Minden, followed by the obligatory nightmare and dream of revenge (Section XVIII). In Section XIX he visits the house where his grandfather was born in B√ºckeburg: > At B√ºckeburg I went up into the town, > To view the old fortress, the Stammburg, > The place where my grandfather was born; > My grandmother came from Hamburg. From there he went on to a meeting with King Ernest Augustus of Hanover in that place, who, \\"accustomed to life in Great Britain\\" detains him for a deadly length of time. The section refers above all to the violation of the constitution by Ernst August in the year 1837, who was opposed by the seven G√∂ttingen professors. Finally, in Section XX, he is at the limit of his journey: In Hamburg he goes in to visit his mother. She, equally, is in control of her responsibilities: *1. Are you hungry? *2. Have you got a wife? *3. Where would you rather live, here with me or in France? *4. Do you always talk about politics? Hamburg Town Hall Section XXI and XXII shows the poet in Hamburg in search of people he knows, and memories, and in Section XXIII he sings the praises of the publisher Campe. Section XXIV describes a meeting with the genius loci of Hamburg, Hammonia. A solemn promise of the greatest secrecy must be made in Old Testament fashion, in which he places his hand under the thigh of the Goddess (she blushes slightly ‚Äì having been drinking rum!). Then the Goddess promises to show her visitor the future Germany. Universal expectation. Then the Censor makes a cut at the critical place. Disappointment. (Section XXV and XXVI) With Section XXVII the Winter‚Äôs Tale ends: > The Youth soon buds, who understands > The poet‚Äôs pride and grandeur > And in his heart he warms himself, > At his soul‚Äôs sunny splendour. In the final stanzas Heine places himself in the tradition of Aristophanes and Dante and speaks directly to the King of Prussia: > Then do not harm your living bards, > For they have fire and arms > More frightful than Jove‚Äôs thunderbolt: > Through them the Poet forms. With a warning to the King, of eternal damnation, the epic closes.  A critic for love of the Fatherland  Deutschland. Ein Winterm√§rchen shows Heine‚Äôs world of images and his folk-song-like poetic diction in a compact gathering, with cutting, ironic criticisms of the circumstances in his homeland. Heine puts his social vision into contrast with the grim ‚ÄòNovember-picture‚Äô of the reactionary homeland which presented itself to his eyes: > A new song, a better song, > O friends, I speak to thee! > Here upon Earth we shall full soon > A heavenly realm decree. > Joyful we on earth shall be > And we shall starve no more; > The rotten belly shall not feed > On the fruits of industry. Above all Heine criticized German militarism and reactionary chauvinism (i.e. nationalism), especially in contrast to the French, whose revolution he understood as a breaking-off into freedom. He admired Napoleon (uncritically) as the man who achieved the Revolution and made freedom a reality. He did not see himself as an enemy of Germany, but rather as a critic out of love for the Fatherland: > Plant the black, red, gold banner at the summit of the German idea, make it > the standard of free mankind, and I will shed my dear heart‚Äôs blood for it. > Rest assured, I love the Fatherland just as much as you do. (from the Foreword).  The ‚ÄòWinter‚Äôs Tale‚Äô today  Heine‚Äôs verse-epic was much debated in Germany right down to our own times. Above all in the century to which it belonged, the work was labelled as the ‚Äòshameful writing‚Äô of a homeless or country-less man, a ‚Äòbetrayer of the Fatherland‚Äô, a detractor and a slanderer. This way of looking at Deutschland. Ein Winterm√§rchen was carried, especially in the period of Nazism, into a ridiculous antisemitic caricature. Immediately after World War II a cheap edition of the poem with Heine‚Äôs Foreword and an introduction by Wolfgang Goetz was published by the Wedding-Verlag in Berlin in 1946. Modern times see in Heine‚Äôs work ‚Äì rather, the basis of a wider concern with nationalism and narrow concepts of German identity, against the backdrop of European integration ‚Äì a weighty political poem in the German language: sovereign in its insight and inventive wit, stark in its images, masterly in its use of language. Heine‚Äôs figure-creations (like, for example, the ‚ÄòLiktor‚Äô) are skilful, and memorably portrayed. A great deal of the attraction which the verse-epic holds today is grounded in this, that its message is not one-dimensional, but rather brings into expression the many-sided contradictions or contrasts in Heine‚Äôs thought. The poet shows himself as a man who loves his homeland and yet can only be a guest and visitor to it. In the same way that Antaeus needed contact with the Earth, so Heine drew his skill and the fullness of his thought only through intellectual contact with the homeland. This exemplified the visible breach which the French July Revolution of 1830 signifies for intellectual Germany: the fresh breeze of freedom suffocated in the reactionary exertions of the Metternich Restoration, the soon-downtrodden ‚ÄòSpring‚Äô of freedom yielded to a new winter of censorship, repression, persecution and exile; the dream of a free and democratic Germany was for a whole century dismissed from the realm of possibility. Deutschland. Ein Winterm√§rchen is a high-point of political poetry of the Vorm√§rz period before the March Revolution of 1848, and in Germany is part of the official educational curriculum. The work taken for years and decades as the anti-German pamphlet of the ‚Äòvoluntary Frenchman‚Äô Heine, today is for many people the most moving poem ever written by an emigrant. Recently, reference to this poem has been made by director S√∂nke Wortmann for his football documentary on the German male national team during the 2006 FIFA world cup. The movie is entitled \\"Deutschland. Ein Sommerm√§rchen\\". The world cup in 2006 is often mentioned as a point in time which had a significant positive impact on modern Germany, reflecting a changed understanding of national identity which has been evolving continuously over the 50 years prior to the event.

The series' first two seasons aired on ABC from 1957 to 1959. The first season was sponsored by Bristol-Myers (consumer products) and the second season by Lipton (tea/soup) and Philip Morris (Marlboro cigarettes). The third and final season aired in syndication from 1959 until 1960. The program was produced by Ziv Television. Series background This program took place in the boom town of Tombstone, Arizona Territory, one of the Old West's most notorious towns and the site of the shootout known as the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Located south of Tucson, Tombstone was then known by the sobriquet \\"the town too tough to die.\\" The program's theme song, \\"Whistle Me Up a Memory,\\" was written by William M. Backer and performed by Jimmy Blaine. The series did not deal with real characters in the history of Tombstone in the 1880s, such as Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, or the Clanton Gang. It was about fictional characters in the American Southwest. The first episode opens, according to the Narrator, on August 4, 1881. Conway played Sheriff Clay Hollister. Eastham, the only other actor besides Conway to appear in all the episodes, played Harris Claibourne, editor of The Tombstone Epitaph (an actual newspaper that still exists in limited form). Eastham, originally a singer in opera and on Broadway, also narrated the series in a deep baritone voice,Alex McNeil, Total Television, New York: Penguin Books, 1996, 4th ed., p. 849, describing each episode as an actual report from the newspaper's archives. The Ziv TV series aired on Wednesdays on ABC in the 1957-1958 season opposite Robert Young's sitcom Father Knows Best, then broadcast on NBC. It was returned to the ABC schedule for 12 new episodes on March 13, 1959, followed by summer rebroadcasts. It replaced the first season of Charles Bronson's Man with a Camera on Friday evenings at the 9:00 Eastern time slot, preceding the popular detective series 77 Sunset Strip. After the network run, Tombstone Territory was placed in syndication and ran mostly outside prime time in selected markets until it ceased production. Conway and Eastham appeared in all 91 episodes. Veteran actor Gerald Mohr had portrayed Doc Holliday the previous year in a first season episode of the television series Maverick starring James Garner and titled \\"The Quick and the Dead,\\" and Mohr reprised his colorfully sardonic performance as the legendary gunfighter in the first season Tombstone Territory episode titled \\"Doc Holliday in Durango,\\" initially broadcast in 1958. The ending credits indicate that \\"This series is produced with the full cooperation of Clayton A.

The first two installations opened at Kings Island and Canada's Wonderland in 2005 under the name Italian Job: Stunt Track, while the third opened at Kings Dominion in 2006 as Italian Job: Turbo Coaster. All three were themed to the climactic chase scene at the end of the 2003 film The Italian Job. Special effects were incorporated throughout the ride to reproduce the scene, although some of the effects were removed in later years. The Italian Job theme was also dropped in 2008 following Cedar Fair's acquisition of the amusement parks from Paramount. History The Italian Job: Stunt Track was announced by Kings Island and Canada's Wonderland on August 12, 2004. It replaced the Lex Taxis antique car ride at Kings Island. The ride opened at Kings Island for previews on April 29, 2005, followed by its grand opening several weeks later on May 20. It opened at Canada's Wonderland on May 1, 2005. On October 12, 2005, Kings Dominion announced they would be adding a clone of Italian Job: Stunt Coaster but with a slightly different name, Italian Job: Turbo Coaster. It opened on May 27, 2006. The ride at Kings Dominion replaced the Diamond Falls shoot-the-chute ride. At the end of the 2007 season, all three Italian Job coasters were renamed to Backlot Stunt Coaster for the start of the 2008 season. The name change was part of a wider effort by Cedar Fair to remove Paramount themes from the chain of parks the company acquired in 2006 from Paramount Parks. Special effects throughout the ride were modified to remove references to the movie, generalizing the overall theme. Ride experience=Layout After accelerating from in three seconds, out of the station, the train enters into a three-story \\"parking garage\\" shell, passing through two upwards helixes meant to mirror the ascension of a car through a true parking garage. The train then drops from the top of the helixes into a \\"street\\" lined with highway signs and three police cars, with sirens and lights flashing. Riders then swerve between the police cars. Riders then go through an overbanked turn at 88 degrees, followed by a dip and then traveling down a set of \\"subway stairs\\". The train then comes to a halt in front of a tunnel. A helicopter rises to the train's left, shooting simulated gunfire. Under Paramount's operation, the gunfire cracked pipes and barrels, which sprayed \\"gasoline\\" (truly, water) all around riders. Though that effect has since been removed, the second round of gunfire still ignites where the gasoline would've splashed, catching two barrels on fire before a gas tank explodes. The train is then launched again into a tunnel, twisting and dropping before coming out of the \\"broken billboard\\", splashing down in an L.A. Aqueduct, and turning left into the ride's station. Trains Train designed as a MINI Cooper coming out of the billboard at Kings Dominion Backlot Stunt Coaster has three trains, each with three cars. Each car can sit four people in two rows of two. Under its original name and theme, the ride featured unique cars which resembled ¬æ scale MINI Coopers. Paramount worked closely with BMW to design the cars. The cars had headlight stickers on the front and working doors on the side. Sound effects were also built into the cars. Each train was arranged the same, with the first car being painted blue, the second car being painted red, and the third car being painted white. Before the 2010 season, the trains were simplified and removed of any resemblance to the MINI Cooper as Cedar Fair no longer holds the license to use MINI Coopers on Backlot Stunt Coaster. They have also changed the arrangement of the car colors on the trains: One train is all blue, the second is all red and the third is all white. Theme All three had similar themes revolving around the climatic chase scene at the end of the 2003 film, The Italian Job. Special effects were incorporated throughout the ride such as a helicopter that attacks riders with a simulated machine gun sound, pyrotechnics and water effects. Sound recordings of \\"Action!\\" and \\"Cut!\\" were also heard during launch and final brake run, respectively. The last drop portraying the Mini Coopers jumping out of a sewer featured spraying water jets to simulate a splashdown effect.

History Turkish Taffy was invented in 1912 by Austrian immigrant Herman Herer, who sold the rights to M. Schwarz & Sons of Newark, New Jersey, which were acquired in 1936 by Victor Bonomo, a Sephardic Jew whose father, Albert J. Bonomo, had emigrated from Izmir, Turkey and founded the Bonomo Company in Coney Island, New York in 1897 to produce saltwater taffy and hard candies.Kaufman, Michael T. (July 4, 1999). \\"Victor A. Bonomo, Maker Of Candy Bars, Dies at 100\\". The New York Times. Retrieved 29 October 2013. According to Tico Bonomo, son of Victor, Turkish Taffy \\"was not really a taffy, but what is technically known as a short nougat,\\" consisting of a batter of corn syrup and egg whites that was cooked and then baked. It was also not Turkish, but created after World War II in the Bonomo factory. It has been marketed in vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and banana flavors. Turkish Taffy was originally sold in large sheets to Woolworth's stores, where pieces were broken off with a ball-peen hammer at the counter and sold by weight. In the late 1940s the company released a version in candy-bar size which the purchaser could whack against a hard surface to break into bite-sized pieces. This property of being shattered or broken by sudden shock, but still pliable and soft when chewed is possible because the candy is a non-Newtonian fluid. Since the pieces were both chewy and slow-melting in the mouth, it was a favorite for the frugal customer. A bar still cost 5¬¢ in the 1960s. By that time, it was marketed by Gold Medal Candy Corporation of Brooklyn, New York. In 1949 Turkish Taffy became one of the first forms of candy advertised and marketed on television, when Bonomo created and sponsored The Magic Clown on NBC Television. Tico Bonomo specifically cited the decision to use television as instrumental in the popularity of the candy-bar sized taffys.Fifty years of candy: consolidation, clowns and confidence, Candy Industry, August 1, 1994] In 1980 the candy became part of the Tootsie Roll Industries of Chicago line of candies, and it was discontinued in 1989.

The ship was built under contract by Messrs Maxon Fish & Co., Mystic, Conn., and was offered for sale to the Navy while on the ways; purchased at Stonington, Connecticut, 29 July 1863 by Isaac Henderson for $110,000; delivered at New York Navy Yard 30 September 1863; and commissioned 13 November 1863, Acting Volunteer Lt. W. G. Saltonstall in command. She was assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, with instructions to report at Hampton Roads to Acting Rear Admiral S. P. Lee. The ship was probably named for the Governor of Connecticut, William Alfred Buckingham. Service On 20 November 1863 she stood out to sea, arriving off Fortress Monroe on the 23d, thence to Norfolk Navy Yard. She departed Hampton Roads 5 December to join the Fleet off Wilmington, North Carolina, for active blockading duty. The crew of the Governor Buckingham rapidly gained experience with the problem of tracking blockade runners. On 20 December with the assistance of Aries she captured the notorious blockade runner Antonica of Nassau, which ran ashore. Antonicas captain and crew attempted to get away in two small boats; but when fired upon they gave themselves up, and the 26 men were taken aboard as prisoners. After boarding and taking possession of the prize in early morning of 21 December, Aries and the tug Violet sent out boats to assist, without success, as the tide had left her fast. On 3 January 1864, Governor Buckingham was with the flagship Fahkee when the blockade runner Bendigo ran aground during the chase; after efforts at salvage failed on 11 January Bendigo was destroyed. That same day the British blockade runner Ranger was discovered after landing her passengers from Bermuda at Merrill's Inlet, 5 miles NE. She was intercepted by Minnesota, Governor Buckingham, Daylight, and Aries when she approached the Western Bar, and was beached and fired by her crew. Attempts by the squadron to extinguish the fire and haul her off were frustrated by Confederate sharpshooters, whose fire completely commanded her decks. Later Governor Buckingham proceeded to Norfolk Navy Yard, for overhaul. She sailed from Hampton Roads on 3 July 1864 to return to blockade duty off Wilmington, and soon after was attached to the 1st Division off New Inlet. From 11 to 25 September she was at Beaufort, S.O., then back on her old station, she chased a blockade runner ashore on 25 September, firing five shots, three of which took effect as the target drove high and dry on the beach. One of the crew was killed, three wounded, and the steamer sent the surgeon and steward to their relief. Next day the blockade runner was set afire, but 20 bales of cotton, part of her cargo, were salvaged. On 30 September 1864 Governor Buckingham took part off Fort Fisher in the destruction of the British-based blockade runner Black Hawk. Having been damaged in several accidental collisions, she entered Norfolk Navy Yard for drydocking on 27 October, and returned off New Inlet on 3 December. Later that month she took part in the first engagement of the Fleet against Fort Fisher, renewing the engagement for 2 days; then her boats were sent in to reembark troops. The second attack upon Fort Fisher (13 to 16 January 1865) resulted in its capture. On 13 January Governor Buckingham was stationed off Half Moon Battery, assisting troops from the transports to land; she also landed provisions, ammunition and entrenching tools. After the battle on 16‚Äì17 January she was employed in carrying the wounded to the transports. On several occasions, in obedience to orders, she shelled the woods near Half Moon Battery. She remained in the area of Fort Fisher through January, dispersing bands of Confederate troops, and on the 19th shelled them out of entrenchments near the beach, allowing Union forces to advance and capture a number of prisoners. On 4 February Governor Buckingham stood out to sea, arriving Norfolk Navy Yard on the 8th. As her boilers and machinery were out of repair, she was decommissioned 27 March and on 12 July 1865 was sold at public auction at California.

Wilson has said that the master tapes were stolen, preventing an official release, although the songs are available on numerous bootlegs. Five of the songs were rerecorded over a decade later and released on Wilson's 2004 album, Gettin' In Over My Head, although some critics believed the remakes weren't as good as the originals. Sweet Insanity is one of the more sought-after bootleg albums. In 2015, Wilson spoke about Sweet Insanity, saying \\"Sweet Insanity was never really released. You‚Äôve got bootlegs, but it was never released. And I thought some of the stuff was pretty good. It wasn‚Äôt the best album I ever wrote. We just didn‚Äôt think it was good enough. They were just like demos. We recorded about 10-12 songs, and we decided not to put it because we thought that maybe people wouldn‚Äôt like it, so we junked it.\\" Background Initially entitled Brian, the album was intended to be a follow up to his 1988 solo debut, Brian Wilson. During this stage in Wilson's life, he was under the care of psychologist Dr. Eugene Landy, who was known for his unconventional 24-hour therapy. Landy was micro-managing Wilson's life, including his creative career, and became Wilson's primary collaborator. The pair had collaborated on Wilson's first solo album as well. Andy Paley remembers that the album's recording was \\"an unpleasant experience\\". Sweet Insanity only exists on physical media as a promotional cassette acetate manufactured for Brains & Genius, Wilson's and Landy's production company. (The actual cassette was presumably manufactured by Warner Bros. Records; The cassette tape uses Warners' clear shell and typeface) and carries a 1991 copyright date. The cassette includes two bonus tracks: (CD Bonus/\\"Country Feelin'\\" and Single, B-Side/\\"Hotter\\"). It's unclear whether this particular cassette contains the first or second iteration of the album. Songs \\"Someone to Love\\" derived a melody from Dennis Wilson's \\"San Miguel\\". \\"Water Builds Up\\" features the same verse melody as \\"Let's Go to Heaven in My Car\\". \\"Hotter\\" was recorded between 1987‚Äì1988, and produced by Brian Wilson and Russ Titelman. \\"Love Ya\\" was originally recorded as \\"Sweetie\\" in the early 1980s, then re-recorded between 1987‚Äì1988, produced by Brian and Titelman. In 2004, \\"Save the Day\\" was rerecorded with new lyrics and renamed \\"Fairy Tale\\". \\"Let's Stick Together\\", which featured \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic on accordion, was retitled \\"The Waltz\\". \\"The Spirit of Rock and Roll\\", which featured Bob Dylan on co-lead vocals; recorded between August 1986‚ÄìJanuary 1987, produced by Brian and Gary Usher; re-recorded for the 2006 Beach Boys album Songs from Here & Back. Reception Brett Milano called it \\"a brilliant album\\" in the Boston Phoenix. \\"For the first time since Til I Die', he's writing directly about his breakdown and recovery...Landy may have written these lyrics, but it hardly matters; Wilson didn't write the lyrics to Pet Sounds either.\\" Milano later labeled it one of Wilson's best post-'60s albums. Jackson Griffith praised it in Tower Records' Pulse magazine, calling it \\"easily the finest, most consistently satisfying Wilson disc since The Beach Boys' Sunflower. He's still got it.\\" Bill Holdship praised the album in both BAM and MOJO magazines. The Detroit News' Susan Whitall and Entertainment Weekly's Dave DiMartino praised the album in their publications, and it appeared on several 1991 year-end poll lists. A cover version of \\"Do You Have Any Regrets?\\" was independently released by Wilson's future bandmate Darian Sahanaja.
