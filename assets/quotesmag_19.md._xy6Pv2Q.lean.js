K. Hobson. It was nominated for the 2010 Nebula Award. Plot summary The Native Star, set in America in 1876, follows the adventures of Emily Edwards, town witch of the tiny Sierra Nevada settlement of Lost Pine. Her business is suffering from the rise of mail-order patent magicks, and her only chance at avoiding the penury at her doorstep is to use a love spell to bewitch the town‚Äôs richest lumberman into marrying her. When the love spell goes terribly wrong, Emily is forced to accept the aid of Dreadnought Stanton--a pompous and scholarly Warlock from New York City--to set things right. Together, they travel from the seedy underbelly of San Francisco‚Äôs Barbary Coast, across the United States by transcontinental railroad and biomechanical flying machine, to the highest halls of American magical power, all while being pursued by various factions who want for themselves a powerful magical artifact that has come into Emily‚Äôs possession.

It premiered on ABC on January 13, 2010. The episode was written by Caroline Williams and directed by Chris Koch. In the episode, Claire finds a photo of a topless woman on her computer and believes that it is Luke's, while in reality is Phil's. Haley believes that Alex has read her journal and the two girls fight, while Luke was the one who did it. Jay buys a statue of a dog dressed as a butler and brings it home, but Gloria does not like it at all. Mitchell and Cameron try to help their Spanish gardener who seems upset but the lack of understanding his language, causes confusion. The episode got a Nielsen rating of 3.2/8 in the 18-49 demographic. Ratings fell around 2 million viewers from the previous episode, a drop attributed to heavy competition from the season premiere of American Idol. It received mixed reviews from television critics. Plot Claire (Julie Bowen) discovers a photo on her computer of a topless woman on a tractor, and she assumes that Luke (Nolan Gould) downloaded it since he is the last one who used her computer. Phil (Ty Burrell) tries to hide that he owns the photo because he believes that Claire will be mad at him and lets her believe that the photo indeed belongs to Luke. He says that it would be better to let him handle it and he will talk to Luke. Haley (Sarah Hyland) believes Alex (Ariel Winter) has read her journal and they get into a fight. Luke is the one who actually did it and he talks about it to Claire. Claire misunderstands what Luke is trying to confess and she thinks that he is talking about the image with the naked woman she found on her computer. Eventually the truth of whose the picture is, is revealed. Jay (Ed O'Neill) brought home a statue of a dog dressed as a butler and named it Barkley. Gloria (Sof√≠a Vergara) is spooked by it and she wants it out of the house. She removes it to the guest room so she will not have to see it every time she enters the house but Jay brings it back. He ends up giving it to Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and Cam (Eric Stonestreet). Meanwhile, Cam and Mitchell try to help their gardener who seems sad but their inability to speak Spanish causes much confusion. At the end, Cam finds out that the gardener was just stressed because of his wedding and the whole family ends up in their home for the ceremony. Reception=Ratings In its original American broadcast, \\"Not in My House\\" was viewed by 7.847 million viewers. The drop in viewership is most likely attributed to airing against the second night of the season premiere of American Idol. Reviews \\"Not in My House\\" received mixed reviews. The episode was well received by Robert Canning of IGN who gave it an 8.5/10 saying that \\"It was smart and subtle and had you smiling joyfully at the goings on, if not laughing out loud for 30 minutes straight.\\" Jason Hughes of TV Squad said that \\"this may have been one of the funniest episodes of Modern Family yet\\". James Poniewozik of Time Magazine said it was not the best but good saying that \\"Fair's fair; last night's episode, which kept the three storylines largely separate, wasn't as strong, But it wasn't because the families were separate or because the stories weren't thematically connected\\". Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ with readers giving it a B saying that \\"Modern Family started out with one of the best pilots I've ever seen. [...] But I'm not entirely sure that the show will be anywhere near my list of favorites by the time, say, season three rolls around. I'd love to be proved wrong, and the way the show has kept up the level of quality this season suggests I will be proved wrong, but at the same time, the show is a solid, out-of-the-box hit with a dedicated audience that loves the shit out of it.\\" ReferencesExternal links *\\"Not in My House\\" at ABC.com * * Category:Modern Family (season 1) episodes Category:2010 American television episodes ","title":"Not in My House"},{"id":"25809703","text":"Prillwitz is a small village in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (Mecklenburg-West Pomerania), on the shores of the lake Lieps, Germany.

A defining event of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War was the typhoid fever epidemic of July to November 1898.Report on the origin and spread of typhoid fever in the U. S. military camps during the Spanish War of 1898, Issue 757 of House document Volume 2, Walter Reed, United States. Surgeon-General's Office, Victor Clarence Vaughan, Edward Oram Shakespeare, Publisher Govt. Print. Off., 1904. The Army consequently undertook a series of mass-retreats and attempted evasions. The Typhoid Board concluded that only one of the five army corps stricken with epidemic typhoid succeeded in suppressing the disease actively, the 2nd Army Corps. In the wake of two fruitless relocations and months of casualties, commanders finally managed to impose an effective latrine-policy. A three-part strategy of draconian defecation-management, mass-disinfection, and flight received the Typhoid Board's imprimatur as the principal, recommended method for suppressing existing epidemics.New Attempts at Typhoid Prevention Second Army Corps The corps was constituted May 7, 1898; on May 16, Maj.

After the declaration of war McKinley revised that arrangement and approved the organization of eight army corps, each of which was to consist of three or more divisions of three brigades each. Each brigade was to have approximately 3,600 officers and enlisted men organized into three regiments and, with three such brigades, each division was to total about 11,000 officers and men. Thus the division was to be about the same size as the division of 1861, but army corps were to be larger. The division staff initially was to have an adjutant general, quartermaster, commissary, surgeon, inspector general, and engineer, with an ordnance officer added later. The brigade staff was identical except that no inspector general or ordnance officer was authorized. In mid-May the volunteers were moved to a few large unfinished camps in the South, and when they arrived only seven instead of the eight projected army corps were organized. Two army corps, the Fourth and Fifth consisted of regulars and volunteers, while the others like the Second Corps were made up of volunteers. Before the new army completed its organization and training, it was thrust into combat. About two-thirds of Fifth Army Corps, in the form of one dismounted cavalry division and two infantry divisions, sailed for Cuba in June 1898. Expeditions also were mounted for Puerto Rico and the Philippine Islands, in which partial army corps provided the troops.Wilson, John B., MANEUVER AND FIREPOWER THE EVOLUTION OF DIVISIONS AND SEPARATE BRIGADES, ARMY LINEAGE SERIES, CENTER OF MILITARY HISTORY, UNITED STATES ARMY, WASHINGTON, D.

The Seventh Illinois Regiment, which was encamped there during the whole time, lost but one man up to the 14th day of December, a record probably not equaled by any other regiment in the service. The establishment of Camp Alger is justifiable upon the report as to the suitableness of the site, but considering the scarcity of water and the want of facilities for bathing, we are of opinion that it was very undesirable, and was not abandoned too soon.\\"CAMP ALGER IMPROVING.; Rapid Decline in Number of Typhoid Cases -- Almost No Other Sickness.\\", New York Times, August 9, 1898.

As part of Eisenmann & Smith he designed the Cleveland Arcade in downtown Cleveland. He also designed the Main building for Case School of Applied Science, present-day Case Western Reserve University, where he was also the school's first professor of civil engineering. He pioneered structural steel construction in the United States and is credited with co- designing Cleveland's Arcade, \\"the first commercial building in the state designated an historic landmark in architecture.\\" From a Case Western University website that no longer exists Eisenmann is also credited with designing the flag of Ohio in 1902.http://www.annin.com/products/flag_us_ohio.asp Flags of the Fifty States - Ohio Early life Eisenmann was born March 26, 1851 in Detroit, Michigan to Christian W. and Mary A. (Schubert) Eisenmann. He graduated from Monroe High School in Michigan. In 1871, he graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in Civil Engineering, and was a member of the Xi Chapter of the Zeta Psi Fraternity. From 1871-1875, Eisenmann worked as an assistant engineer for the United States Lake Survey for the Great Lakes.https://case.edu/ech/articles/e/eisenmann-john He then went to Europe to study Architecture, studying first at the Royal School of Technology of Munich, Germany 1875-1876, graduating from the Technical School of Stuttgart, Germany, in 1877.http://planning.city.cleveland.oh.us/landmark/arch/pdf/archdetailPrint.php?afil=&archID;=75 From 1878-1879 he returned working for the United States Lake Survey. From 1879-1882, he then worked for the Mississippi River Commission. On April 5, 1882, John Eisenmann married Annie M. Theising. Arcade The arcade was erected in 1890, at a cost of $867,000. It opened on Memorial Day (May 31, 1890) and is an example of Victorian architecture, consisting of two nine- story buildings joined by a five-story arcade. It includes a glass skylight spanning 300 feet (91 m) along the four balconies.Arcade, Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, Case Western Reserve University, 10 July 1997. The arcade is identified as the first indoor shopping mall in the United States. and was built by Detroit Bridge Co., run by Stephen V. Harkness. It is one of the few remaining arcades of its kind in the United States. Modeled after the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II located in Milan, the Arcade comprises two nine-story towers with a skylight, 100 feet (30 m) high, made of 1,800 panes of glass spanning over 300 feet (91 m). The construction was financed by John D. Rockefeller, Marcus Hanna, Charles F. Brush and several other wealthy Clevelanders of the day. The Arcade was modified in 1939, with remodeling of the Euclid Avenue entrance and some structural supports added. The Arcade is a cross between a lighted court and a commercial shopping street, composed of three structures: two nine-story office buildings facing out to Euclid and Superior Avenues, connected via the five-story iron-and-glass-enclosed arcade. The Richardsonian arched entrance along Superior Avenue is original but the Euclid Avenue front was remodeled in 1939 by the firm of Walker and Weeks. Vertical lines of the columns rise nearly 100 feet (33 m) to the glass roof and create a spacious domed interior. In 2001, the Hyatt corporation redeveloped the Arcade into Cleveland's first Hyatt Regency hotel. The Hyatt Regency occupies the two towers and the top three floors of the atrium area. The two lower floors of the atrium area remain open to the public with retail merchants and a food court. In addition, the Hyatt's lobby and offices are located near the Superior Avenue entrance.

In rodent anatomy, the zygomatic plate is a bony plate derived from the flattened front part of the zygomatic arch (cheekbone).Voss, 1988, p. 271 At the back, it connects to the front (maxillary) root of the zygomatic arch, and at the top it is connected to the rest of the skull via the antorbital bridge.Steppan, 1995, p. 29 It is part of the maxillary bone, or upper jaw, which also contains the upper cheekteeth. Primitively, rodents have a nearly horizontal zygomatic plate.Wood, 1935, p. 246 In association with specializations in zygomasseteric system, several distinct morphologies have developed across the order. The term is also used for an analogous structure in some South American typotheres, including PseudotypotheriumPatterson, 1934, p. 124 and Medistylus.Reguero et al., 2007, p. 1305 Function The zygomatic plate serves to resist muscular tension resulting from the contraction of the incisors by the anterior deep masseter muscle; thus, rodents which pulverize hard food with the incisors tend to have broader zygomatic plates than those that rather use their molars for this purpose.Voss, 1988, pp. 408‚Äì410 Hystricomorpha The members of this large and diverse suborder have a narrow, low zygomatic plate.Ellerman, 1940, pp. 24‚Äì29, 33; Jenkins et al., 2005, p. 427 Sciuromorpha The suborder Sciuromorpha includes three families. Squirrels (family Sciuridae) tend to have broad zygomatic plate that extend above the infraorbital foramen.Ellerman, 1940, p. 30; Miller and Gidley, 1918, pp. 432‚Äì433 The mountain beaver (Aplodontia rufa), the only surviving member of its family, retains the primitive narrow and low plate.Ellerman, 1940, p. 29 The dormice (Gliridae) have broad, high zygomatic plates,Ellerman, 1940, p. 37 except for Graphiurus, which has a lower plate.Ellerman, 1940, p. 36 Castorimorpha Members of the suborder Castorimorpha, which includes the beavers, pocket gophers, and pocket mice, tend to have broad zygomatic plate that extend above the infraorbital foramen.Ellerman, 1940, p. 31; Miller and Gidley, 1918, pp. 432‚Äì433 Anomaluromorpha Anomaluromorpha is a small suborder, containing only two families. Anomaluridae have a low and narrow zygomatic plate.Ellerman, 1940, p. 32 Members of the subfamily Idiurinae are atypical in having the zygomatic plate extended forward nearly to the incisors.Ellerman, 1940, p. 33 The condition in the springhaas (Pedetes) is similar. Myomorpha Myomorpha is the largest suborder of rodents.Carleton and Musser, 2005 In the most numerous subgroup, the Muroidea (including all living families except Dipodidae), the zygomatic plate is generally broad and tilted upwards.Ellerman, 1940, p. 35; Ellerman, 1941, pp. 1‚Äì2 Muroids may have the plate extending in front of the front (maxillary) root of the actual zygomatic arch, creating a zygomatic notch. In some, the plate extends at the front into a spinous process, the zygomatic spine.Steppan, 1995, p. 30; Weksler, 2006, fig. 17 Dipodidae Members of the family Dipodidae, which have hystricomorphous zygomasseteric morphology, have nearly horizontal, narrow zygomatic plates.Wood, 1935, p. 246; Ellerman, 1940, p. 34 Platacanthomyidae Members of the small family Platacanthomyidae have a relatively narrow zygomatic plate.Miller and Gidley, 1918, p. 437; Ellerman, 1940, p. 37 Spalacidae The fossorially specialized family Spalacidae shows peculiarities in the condition of the zygomatic plate. In Tachyoryctes and the Rhizomyinae, it is tilted upward and fused to the sides of the snout (rostrum). In the Spalacinae and Myospalacinae, on the other hand, the plate is tilted downward into an almost horizontal position.Miller and Gidley, 1918, p. 438; Ellerman, 1940, p. 37 Calomyscidae The mouse-like hamster (Calomyscus), the only member of its family, has a straight front margin on the zygomatic plate.Ellerman, 1941, p. 404 Nesomyidae The family Nesomyidae is restricted to Africa. Dendromus has a narrow zygomatic plate,Ellerman, 1941, p. 307 as do SteatomysEllerman, 1941, p. 311 and Prionomys.Ellerman, 1941, p. 315 Brachyuromys has an arvicoline-like high zygomatic plate. In Eliurus, the front border of the plate is straight.Ellerman, 1941, p. 76 Nesomys has a low zygomatic plate.Ellerman, 1941, p. 376 In Hypogeomys, it is broad, but rather low.Ellerman, 1941, p. 481 Muridae Muridae is the order's largest family, and contains several subfamilies. Deomys, a member of the Deomyinae, has an unusually low zygomatic plate,Ellerman, 1941, p. 6 as does Lophuromys, a member of the same subfamily. Most members of the subfamily Murinae, the Old World rats and mice, have a fairly broad zygomatic plate with a well-developed zygomatic notch.Tate, 1951, p. 210 A zygomatic spine is developed in some Australian genera, including Notomys and some Pseudomys. Except for Xeromys, Hydromys and related genera (\\"hydromyines\\") have a narrow plate, lacking the notch, as does Hyomys, Macruromys, Crunomys,Ellerman, 1941, p. 56 and Rhynchomys.Ellerman, 1941, p. 296 The Philippine Batomys, Carpomys, and Crateromys have well-developed zygomatic plates, reminiscent of those in Arvicolinae.Ellerman, 1941, p. 48 Phloeomys has a broad zygomatic plate.Ellerman, 1941, p. 292 Cricetidae The family Cricetidae is the order's second largest, containing several subfamilies and hundreds of species.Musser and Carleton, 2005 The subfamily Arvicolinae, the voles and lemmings, has the zygomatic plate tilted upwards very strongly. In the subfamily Tylomyinae, Nyctomys has a narrow zygomatic plate.Ellerman, 1941, p. 375 Among members of the Neotominae, Baiomys, Reithrodontomys, Onychomys, and Peromyscus has a narrow zygomatic plate.Ellerman, 1941, pp. 378, 385, 401, 404 Members of the subfamily Sigmodontinae, which includes a number of tribes, usually have the antorbital bridge below the upper surface of the skull. Most have a zygomatic notch.Steppan, 1995, p. 30; Weksler, 2006, p. 32 The extent of the zygomatic plate at the back is also variable within Sigmodontinae, with some having the plate extending back to the level of the first upper molar and others having shorter plates.Weksler, 2006, p. 32 Members of the semiaquatic tribe Ichthyomyini are unique among the Sigmodontinae in lacking the zygomatic notch.Voss, 1988, p. 284 In ichthyomyines, the development of the zygomatic plate is correlated with the development of the teeth: those species with large molars and small incisors, including species of Anotomys and Rheomys, have slender plates that do not extend back to the first molars, whereas those with larger incisors and smaller molars, including some Ichthyomys and Neusticomys, have broader zygomatic plates that do reach the level of the first molars.Voss, 1988, pp. 289‚Äì290 The genus Sigmodon, which is classified in its own tribe, has a broad zygomatic plate and a zygomatic spine.Voss, 1992, p. 13 Relative width of the zygomatic plate can distinguish some species of Sigmodon.Voss, 1992, p. 35 Most members of the tribe Phyllotini have the antorbital bridge located higher than is usual in Sigmodontinae (Calomys and Andalgalomys show the normal sigmodontine condition). A similar condition characterizes Euneomys, Neotomys, Reithrodon, which are no longer considered phyllotines, but to an even larger extent than in most actual phyllotines; in Euneomys, the antorbital bridge is inserted on the upper surface of the skull.Steppan, 1995, pp. 28‚Äì29; D'El√≠a et al., 2007, pp. 191‚Äì192 Most phyllotines have zygomatic spines, but the structure is more well-developed in Reithrodon.

Kompromat may be acquired from various security services, or outright forged, and then publicized by use of a public relations official. Widespread use of has been one of the characteristic features of the politics of Russia and other post-Soviet states.Operation Smear Campaign, The Ukrainian Week (10 September 2013)  Etymology  The term is a borrowing of the Russian KGB slang term from the Stalin era, which is short for \\"compromising material\\" (). It refers to disparaging information that can be collected, stored, traded, or used strategically across all domains: political, electoral, legal, professional, judicial, media, and business. The origins of the term trace back to 1930s secret police jargon.  Techniques  In the early days, featured doctored photographs, planted drugs, grainy videos of liaisons with prostitutes hired by the KGB, and a wide range of other primitive entrapment techniques. More contemporary forms of appear as a form of cybercrime. One aspect of that stands the test of time is that the compromising information is often sexual in nature.  Use  is part of the political culture in Russia, with many members of the business and political elite having collected and stored potentially compromising material on their political opponents. does not necessarily target individuals or groups, but rather collects information that could be useful at a later time. Compromising videos are often produced long in advance of when leverage over people is needed. Opposition research is conducted in the U.S. to find compromising material on political opponents so that such material may be released to weaken those opponents. Some contend that differs from opposition research, in that such information is used to exert influence over people rather than to simply win elections. Nevertheless, compromising material uncovered by opposition research need not be used in only legal or ethical ways. It can be used to exert influence over Western leaders just as surely as it can be used to exert influence over Russian leaders.  History  In the 1950s, British civil servant John Vassall was a victim of a gay honey trap operation, producing which could be used against him since homosexuality was illegal in Britain at the time. During a 1957 visit to Moscow, American journalist Joseph Alsop also fell victim to a gay honey trap operation conducted by the KGB.

In 1999, a video aired with a man resembling Yury Skuratov in bed with two women that later would lead to his dismissal as Prosecutor General of Russia. It was released after he began looking into charges of corruption by President Boris Yeltsin and his associates. In August 2009, videos allegedly released by the FSB purportedly featured American diplomat Brendan Kyle Hatcher making telephone calls, presumably to a prostitute, then engaging in sexual activity with a woman. The United States Department of State protested that it was a doctored, unproven tape. In April 2010, politician Ilya Yashin and comedian Victor Shenderovich were involved in a sex scandal with a woman claimed to have acted as a Kremlin honey trap to discredit opposition figures. The video was released only two days before the wedding of Shenderovich's daughter.

In 2015, the UK's Crown Prosecution Service announced that it would prosecute Vladimir Bukovsky for \\"prohibited images\\" found on his computer; however, the case against Bukovsky was put on hold as investigators tried to determine whether the pornographic images were planted.

It was described as the \\"Twitter of personal finance\\", and was often compared with Twitter because it was based on that company's open sharing model. One purpose of the site was to facilitate discussion and comparison shopping among people who are connected with each other online. As of July, 2010, the company primarily focused on social sharing of product and service reviews. The Blippy service was shut down as of May 2011. History Blippy was founded by Ashvin Kumar, Chris Estreich, and Philip J. Kaplan. Blippy launched on $1.6 million of financing from a number of prominent venture capital firms, including Charles River Ventures and Sequoia Capital, and angel investors Evan Williams, Jason Calacanis and James Hong. On April 23, 2010, social media guide Mashable revealed that Blippy had allowed Google to index detailed transaction information, thus resulting in four users' full credit card numbers being exposed to the public. A blog post from the official Blippy blog claimed the incident was \\"a lot less bad than it looks\\" and apologized for their mistake of putting credit card information in a hidden div tag during the beta test period of the website. This extended information was indexed by Google and was viewable in Google cache. A May 2011 TechCrunch article discussed the decline of the service as it struggled to find relevance among consumers. According to then-CEO Ashvin Kumar, the service was unable to significantly increase user engagement, indicating that Blippy, at the time, had only 100,000 registered users and, of those, only 30% had shared a purchase. Kumar indicated that the Blippy staff was considering moving in a different direction in the social commerce category away from the current Blippy product.

April 15, 2000 there was a raid at the Convergence Center at the Manhattan Laundry on Florida Avenue On April 15 the Washington D.C. Police preemptively raided (without a search warrant) the Convergence Center, citing fire safety. This police action was cited as an 'unconstitutional raid' during the subsequent class action lawsuit. The day before the larger protest scheduled on April 16, a smaller group of protesters demonstration against the Prison-Industrial Complex in the District of Columbia. Mass arrests were conducted; 678 people were arrested, including bystanders, journalists and tourists when the police did a sweep of the block. Majority of the arrests on April 15 occurred at 20th Street NW between I and K streets. Three-time Pulitzer Prize winning, Washington Post photographer Carol Guzy was detained by police and arrested on April 15, and two journalists for the Associated Press also reported being struck by police with batons. These arrests on April 15 were false and later spurred a class action lawsuit called 'Becker, et al. v. District of Columbia, et al..'. April 16, 2000 On April 16 and 17 the demonstrations and street actions around the IMF that followed, the number of those arrested grew to 1,300 people.

This process uses software to encode the closed captioning data into a video, instead of the dedicated closed caption hardware encoders that were previously required. Originally, e-Captioning could be done only for web based new media formats such as Windows Media, Real Video, QuickTime, and Flash. However, e-Captioning is now available to TV Broadcast facilities for tapeless workflows. Prior to the advent of e-Captioning, closed captioning was added to a video using a linear deck-to-deck process, which required the use of a physical master video tape, two tape decks (play and record), and a hardware closed captioning encoder.WGBH - Media Access Group - MAG Guide Vol. 5 Since this equipment is very expensive,closed caption encoder B&H; Photo Video it was not practical for most video production facilities to own it on site. Instead, video editors had to first output a video to tape, then mail the tape to a special closed captioning facility. In the process, a second video tape with closed captions would be created, incurring generation loss. Finally, the tape would need to be mailed to its final destination. If the video later required edits or changes, then the producer would have to ship another master tape to the closed captioning facility, repeating the process and possibly incurring additional fees. e-Captioning replaces the hardware encoding step with a non-linear file based workflow. Since it can be accomplished via e-mail, FTP, or other file transfer methods, there are no costs for physically shipping a video tape, and less impact on the environment. This also means that e-Captioning can be performed faster, and the resulting video can be of higher quality due to the lack of generation loss. Finally, e-Captioning opens up new options for delivering captioned video with tapeless video workflows, further editing of the video in a non- linear editing system, or converting videos from one format to another (for example, from tape to web video) while preserving the closed captions.

It provides digital and physical textbook rentals, online tutoring, and other student services. The company was launched in 2005, and began trading publicly on the New York Stock Exchange in November 2013. As of March 2020 the company reported having 2.9 million subscribers to Chegg Services. History In October 2000, Iowa State University students Josh Carlson, Mike Seager, and Mark Fiddleke launched Chegg's forerunner, Cheggpost, a Craigslist-style message board for Iowa State students.\\"Auction site connects buyers and sellers\\" by Nate Engelberth; Iowa State Daily; October 19, 2000. Chegg is a combination of the words chicken and egg, and references the founders‚Äô catch-22 feeling of being unable to obtain a job without experience, while being unable to acquire experience without a job. Carlson then teamed with Iowa State MBA Osman Rashid, an avid user of the site who recognized its potential to disrupt the textbook market, which had \\"drastically outpaced the rate of inflation\\".\\"Fast-Growing Chegg Aims for High Marks with Students\\" by Lisa Girard; Entrepreneur; January 18, 2012. The company was incorporated in 2005 by Carlson, Rashid, and Aayush Phumbhra. At that time, it offered scholarship searches, internship matching, and college application advice. Some initial start-up funding was provided by Rashid.\\"How Chegg Has Turned Education Upside Down\\" by Nat Berman; Money Inc; November 7, 2016. In February 2006, Carlson left the company. Phumbhra and Rashid rebranded, launching Chegg, Inc. in December 2007, with Rashid as CEO. After ending services unrelated to renting and purchasing textbooks, the company adjusted its business model to reflect that of Netflix's then rental-based model, concentrating on renting textbooks to students, and Chegg expanded to a national market. It later added goods and student services through corporate acquisitions.\\"Apple Creates New Wrinkle In Start-Up's Plan To Disrupt Textbook Industry\\" by Helen Coster; Forbes; January 25, 2012 In 2008, revenues were about $10 million; in 2009, revenues for the month of January were reported as $10 million. Following a brief tenure by former Ask.com and Match.com CEO Jim Safka in 2009,\\"Rosensweig Lands at Textbook Renter Chegg.com\\" by MIGUEL HELFT; The New York Times; FEBRUARY 2, 2010. former Guitar Hero CEO Dan Rosensweig was appointed CEO in 2010. Chegg began trading shares publicly on the New York Stock Exchange in November 2013. Its IPO was reported to have raised $187.5 million, with an initial market capitalization of about $1.1 billion. In 2014, Chegg entered a partnership with book distributor Ingram Content Group to distribute all of Chegg's physical textbook rentals. In April 2017, Chegg and Pearson Education began a textbook rental partnership; In the pilot program, the publisher Pearson made 50 editions of high-volume textbooks (both digital and print) available only to rent. Chegg served as the exclusive rental outlet. In September 2018, Chegg announced a data breach had occurred in April 2018 that may have involved 40 million active and inactive registered users. The breach may have included data such as user names, Chegg passwords, email addresses, and shipping addresses. The company reported that social security numbers and bank account information were not affected by the breach. As of March 2020 the company reported having 2.9 million subscribers to Chegg Services. Acquisitions In 2010, Chegg made its first acquisition, purchasing CourseRank (later disabling the platform, in 2014). That year, Chegg also acquired Cramster, a provider of online homework help, and Notehall, an online marketplace for class notes. In 2011, Chegg acquired Zinch, a scholarship search and networking service for high school students and college recruiters, and continues to offer the service, under the Chegg brand name. Chegg acquired software company 3D3R in late 2011 to develop its digital textbook product, kickstart its mobile product group, and open an engineering office in Rehovot, Israel. In June 2014 Chegg acquired online tutoring platform InstaEDU, for a reported $30 million, renaming the division Chegg Tutors,\\"Chegg buys InstaEDU in transition away from book rentals\\", by Erin Griffith; Fortune; March 6, 2013. and in October 2014 it acquired Internships.com.\\"Chegg\\"; Crunchbase Chegg acquired Imagine Easy Solutions, a provider of online bibliography and research tools, for a reported $42 million, in 2016. In 2017, the company acquired Cogeon GmbH, a German math education provider, for $15 million cash; Cogeon's app, Math 42, uses artificial intelligence to assess individual students' weaknesses in math, and to inform targeted training. In 2018, Chegg acquired WriteLab, which uses AI to analyze text and suggest improvements, and online flash card tool StudyBlue. During late 2019, Chegg acquired online coding school Thinkful,\\"Chegg to Acquire Coding Boot Camp\\" by Lindsay McKenzie; Inside Higher Ed; September 5, 2019. for $80 million cash.\\"Chegg To Acquire Online Skills-Based Learning Platform Thinkful To Help Students Accelerate Their Path From Learning To Earning\\"; Reuters; September 4, 2019. Leadership Chegg headquarters in Santa Clara As of July 29, 2019, Chegg's board of directors consists of: *Dan Rosensweig, co-chair, president and CEO at Chegg * Richard Sarnoff, co-chair at Chegg; chair at KKR & Co. * Renee Budig, EVP and CFO at CBS Interactive *Melanie Whelan, CEO at SoulCycle *Marne Levine, VP at Facebook * Ted Schlein, partner at Kleiner Perkins *John York, co-chair at San Francisco 49ers *Paul J. LaBlanc, president at Southern New Hampshire University Criticism and controversies Some services offered by Chegg have been repeatedly documented as being problematic. These services include academic file-sharing,Rogerson, A. M., & Basanta, G. (2016). Peer-to-peer file sharing and academic integrity in the Internet age. In T. Bretag (Ed.), Handbook of Academic Integrity (pp. 273-285). Singapore: Springer.Eaton, S. E. (2020). Academic Integrity During COVID-19: Reflections from the University of Calgary. International Studies in Educational Administration, 48(1), 80-85. Retrieved from https://prism.ucalgary.ca/handle/1880/112293 which has been documented as being a form of violation of academic integrity at many schools. In February 2019, Chegg formed a partnership with Purdue University's Online Writing Lab (OWL), to make online educational writing tools more accessible to its students. The affiliation was met by some faculty criticism, alluding to Chegg helping students cheat; OWL director Harry Denny reported that he did not expect Purdue's reputation to suffer as a result, citing that ‚ÄúMy experience has been that the company is committed to partnering with faculty and administration to address their concerns.\\" A report published by Citron Research in July 2019 claims that \\"Chegg has created forums to circumvent Turnitin, proving that Chegg is helping users continue institutionalized cheating\\". Controversy around the company, and related companies offering similar services, escalated in 2020, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, Georgia Tech alerted students in a physics class that certain students in the class had cheated on their online final exam by using answers posted on Chegg, certain students in a chemistry class at Boston University were found to have similarly cheated on an online exam, and solutions to a physics exam at Washington University in St. Louis were posted on Chegg during the exam period. Chegg is allegedly cooperating with the investigations. As a result, some schools have now begun providing explicit guidance to students regarding file-sharing.Sheridan College. (2020).

Finance; February 12, 2019. with services accounting for 79% of revenue. Students may search for both scholarships and internships on the website, and typically pay to access Chegg Services, such as Study, Advanced Writing, Tutors, and Math Solver, on a monthly basis. Music 101 Chegg sponsors music instruction contests for colleges in a program named Music 101. These conclude with live classroom instruction by noted music artists, and a $10,000 grant from its David B. Goldberg Music Scholarship fund for the winning school music department. In 2019, the company launched its ninth annual Chegg Music 101 campaign featuring YUNGBLUD.

Abakovsky's Aerowagon  Crash incident  On 24 July 1921, a group of delegates to the First Congress of the Profintern,The Communist International, organ of the Executive Committee of the Communist International, no.19, [1921] led by Fyodor Sergeyev, took the Aerowagon from Moscow to the Tula collieries to test it. Abakovsky was also on board. Although they successfully arrived in Tula, on the return route to Moscow the Aerowagon derailed at high speed near Serpukhov, killing six of the 22 people on board. A seventh man later died of his injuries.Letters from Tom Mann to Elsie Mann, Moscow, 26 and 30 July 1921; archives of Tom Mann, Modern Records Centre, University of Warwick, document references: MSS.334/3/6/5-6.

It is chiefly used in microelectronics as substrate for high power and high density multi-chip modules, where it aids with removal of waste heat.Davidson, H. L et al. Copper-diamond composite substrates for electronic components, January 25, 1995 Dymalloy was developed as part of CRADA between Sun Microsystems and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. It was first researched for use in space-based electronics for the Brilliant Pebbles project.Diamond-copper- silver alloy developed for MCM substrates, July 1, 1994 Dymalloy is prepared from diamond powder of about 25 micrometers size. The grains are coated by physical vapor deposition with 10 nanometers thick layer of alloy of tungsten with 26% rhenium, forming a tungsten carbide layer that assists bonding, then coated with 100 nanometers of copper to avoid carbide oxidation, then compacted in a mold and infiltrated with molten copper-silver alloy. Adding 55 vol.% of diamond yields material with thermal expansion matching that of gallium arsenide; slightly higher amount of diamond allows matching to silicon. Copper can be used instead of copper-silver alloy, but the higher melting point may cause partial transformation of diamond to graphite. The material shows some plasticity. High mechanical strain causes brittle failure in the diamond grains, and ductile failure in the matrix. The diamond grains give the alloy a degree of surface texture; when a smooth surface is desired, the alloy can be plated and polished. In 1996, the price for a 10√ó10√ó0.1 cm substrate was quoted as USD 200.Developmental work continues on dymalloy, In Science and Technology Review, March 1996, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, p. 3 Similar alloys are possible with the metal phase consisting of one or more of silver, copper, gold, aluminium, magnesium, and zinc. The carbide-forming metal can be selected from titanium, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, and chromium, where Ti, Zr, and Hf are preferable. The amount of carbide-forming metal must be sufficient to coat at least 25% of the diamond grains, as otherwise the bonding is insufficient, the heat transfer between matrix and diamond grains is weak which leads to loss of effectivity towards the level of the matrix metal alone, and the material may deform at higher temperatures, and must be low in order to prevent formation of too thick carbide layer that would hinder heat transfer. The volume of diamond should be higher than 30 vol.%, as lower ratio does not provide significant increase of thermal conductivity, and lower than 70 vol.% as higher ratio of diamond makes thermal expansion matching to semiconductors difficult. The grains should also be completely surrounded with metal, to avoid deformation due to different thermal expansion coefficients between diamond and metal; the carbide coating assists with this.Nishibayashi, Yoshiki, Manufacturing process of a heat sink for semiconductors, European Patent EP0898310; filed 07/29/1998; issued 07/06/2005 A similar material is AlSiC, with aluminium instead of copper-silver alloy and silicon carbide instead of diamond.

Production The film was produced by BBC Wales to tie in with the exhibition Moctezuma: Aztec Ruler at the British Museum. Reception=Reviews Alex Hardy writing in The Times states that, Dan Snow jumps around from moral codes, to superstitions, to food production, to using sacrifice as a weapon of state control as he describes how the Aztec civilisation rose inordinately quickly ‚Äì in less time than it took the US to become a \\"world leader\\", and, asks: was [Montezuma] rather a tragic figure, a victim of circumstance? He concludes that, If the British Museum‚Äôs forthcoming exhibition on the Aztec leader... is anything like as intensely packed as this hour-long documentary, then its ¬£12 entrance fee will certainly be fair game. Ratings Broadcast 2009-09-19: 1.1 million viewers (5% audience share). Synopsis Dan Snow journeys to the ancient heart of Mexico in search of the lost civilisation of the Aztecs and their last and greatest ruler, Montezuma II (1502‚Äì1520). Montezuma inherited an empire of five million people, stretching from present-day Mexico to Nicaragua, from his uncle. His rule was marked by incessant warfare. Enemy states were growing more powerful and conquered tribes were becoming more rebellious. Within months of taking the throne in 1502, he changed from a man of good reason into a pitiless autocrat who declared himself a god, believing that fear and ruthlessness were the only ways to stop the empire falling apart. Yet it was at the hands of Cortes and the Spanish conquistadors that Montezuma met his downfall. But what was his relationship with Cortes, and why did such a ruthless leader submit to his captors with such relative ease? As Dan Snow visits the ruins and picks through current excavations, he pieces together the evidence of a gripping story: a divine tragedy of errors, the clash of civilisations, the end of a world - and a very human God.

The church is Grade I listed by the Department for Culture, Media & Sport as a building of outstanding architectural or historic interest. It is one of only five Grade I listed buildings in the City of Nottingham. It is situated on High Pavement at the heart of the historic Lace Market district and is also known as St Mary's in the Lace Market. It is a member of the Major Churches Network, and part of the parish of All Saints', St Mary's and St Peter's, Nottingham. History The church is mentioned in the Domesday Book and is believed to go back deep into Saxon times. The main body of the present building (at least the third on the site) dates from the end of the reign of Edward III (1377) to that of Henry VII (1485‚Äì1509). The nave was finished before 1475 and it is notable for its uniformity of gothic perpendicular style.Gill, Harry, 1916, Thoroton Society Transactions Volume XX.

A complex work in bronze, the door contains 10 panels with New Testament scenes, and two door handles with cherubic heads. A further eight heads are on the cross pieces. Above, Christ and angel with doves. The bronze doors were designed in 1904 by Henry Wilson in memory of his father-in-law, Rev. Francis Morse. The intention of the design of the doors is to illustrate the Life of Our Lord in its relation with the Holy Mother to whom the church is dedicated and by the general treatment to suggest the idea of pity. In the tympanum enclosed within a vesica the Holy Mother supports and cherishes the body of Christ, while in the spandrels, on either side, the gates of Death and Life are suggested: the Dove, typifying the spirit, enters weary into the one and issues strong-winged from the other, thus symbolising the unending round of Death and Life. The dedicatory inscription \\"In loving memory of Francis Morse, 1818‚Äì1886, Father, Pastor, Friend\\" in the form of a pierced cresting, divides the tympanum from the doors themselves. These are formed into panels by mouldings of beaten bronze, with angel bosses at the intersections. On each leaf of the door are five panels, in relief, illustrating the Life of Our Lord, the subjects on the left leaf being ‚ÄúThe Annunciation,‚Äù with Gabriel appearing at the Virgin's window in the early morning; ‚ÄúThe Visitation,‚Äù with the Virgin running to meet her kinswoman. Below these come ‚ÄúThe Nativity,‚Äù followed by ‚ÄúThe Epiphany,‚Äù and the lowest panel shows the Salvator Mundi on a Cross of branching vine. At the foot of the Cross stand Adam and Eve, conscious of the fall, while the doves of peace and pardon hover overhead. The subjects of the panels on the right door of the leaf are ‚ÄúThe flight into Egypt‚Äù; ‚ÄúThe Baptism in the Jordan‚Äù; ‚ÄúThe entry into Jerusalem‚Äù; The three Maries at the Sepulchre‚Äù; and ‚ÄúThe Resurrection.‚Äù In this panel the Saviour is shown emerging from the tomb and while still bound with the grave clothes, the Spirit of Life, in the form of a Dove, flies to His breast, and overhead the birds sing at the coming of a new Dawn.

In recent years, in addition to its function as a place of worship, St Mary's is the venue for a wide range of concerts and public performances, and is home to the Nottingham Bach Choir. The assistant curate at St Mary's takes the ancient title 'Lecturer'. This title, fell into disuse in the 17th century, was revived for Rev. John Pennington on his appointment in 1975. The last to hold the post was Rev. Stephen Morris, until 2014. The church retains the Book of Common Prayer, the traditional Liturgical colours and the principal services are sung by a robed choir. St Mary's retains the historic practice of celebrating the Eucharist at a High Altar Ad orientem with priest and people facing eastwards, rather than the contemporary practice of Versus populum having the priest facing the congregation.

This was replaced in 1807 by a clock by Thomas Hardy of Nottingham. The 1707 clock was moved to Staunton church. The current tower clock which dates from 1936 was installed by George & Francis Cope. It was the first electric auto-wind clock by that firm. Music=Choir There are three choral services a week ‚Äì Wednesday Evensong, Sunday Eucharist and Sunday Evensong. Under the leadership of John Keys, the Choir of St Mary's is highly regarded. Renowned for its versatility and wide repertoire it performs music from plainsong through to world premieres, performs regularly in concert on its own and with St Mary's resident orchestra, The Orchestra of the Restoration. Organ and Choral Scholarships are available to students in full-time higher education. Organ The Organ is by Marcussen & S√∏n of Denmark and is a fine example of a neo-classical style instrument.

X·∫©m or H√°t x·∫©m (X·∫©m singing) is a type of Vietnamese folk music which was popular in the Northern region of Vietnam but is nowadays considered an endangered form of traditional music in Vietnam. In the dynastic time, x·∫©m was generally performed by blind artists who wandered from town to town and earned their living by singing in common places. X·∫©m artists often play ƒë√†n b·∫ßu or ƒë√†n nh·ªã to accompany the songs themselves, and sometimes they form a band with one singer and others who play traditional instruments such as the drum or ph√°ch. The melodies of x·∫©m are borrowed from different types of Vietnamese folk music such as tr·ªëng qu√¢n or quan h·ªç, while its themes are generally The Tale of Ki·ªÅu, L·ª•c V√¢n Ti√™n, and other popular Vietnamese stories. History and performers The origin of x·∫©m was dated from the Tr·∫ßn dynasty in the 14th century. During the dynastic time, x·∫©m was popular in the Northern region of Vietnam. Traditionally, x·∫©m was performed by blind artists who wandered from town to town and earned their living by singing in common places such as markets or communal temples. At the beginning of the 20th century, x·∫©m artists performed on the trams of the public transport system of Hanoi, so this type of folk music was sometimes called x·∫©m t√†u ƒëi·ªán (tram x·∫©m). When the tram lines were abandoned in the 1980s, x·∫©m t√†u ƒëi·ªán disappeared and x·∫©m gradually fell into oblivion. Facing the unstoppable decline of x·∫©m, researchers and devoted artists tried but failed to revitalize this art form. Nowadays, x·∫©m is considered an endangered form of Vietnamese traditional music because the number of experienced artists rapidly declines while the younger generation usually prefers modern types of music. The most famous recent artisan of this art form was H√† Th·ªã C·∫ßu (1917-2013), the so-called \\"last surviving artisan of x·∫©m.\\"Last surviving artisan of Xam singing dies She was one of the few artisans who was honoured by the title Ngh·ªá sƒ© ∆∞u t√∫ (Outstanding Artist of Vietnam). There are several efforts to preserve and propagate x·∫©m, such as the introduction of x·∫©m performance in the ƒê·ªìng Xu√¢n night market, and encouraging young artists to learn x·∫©m from old artisans. Performance elements The melodies of x·∫©m are borrowed from different types of Vietnamese folk music such as tr·ªëng qu√¢n, quan h·ªç, ch√®o or lullabies. Themes of x·∫©m songs are often drawn from popular stories, poems and legends in Vietnam like Truy·ªán Ki·ªÅu, L·ª•c V√¢n Ti√™n, Th·∫°ch Sanh or Nh·ªã ƒë·ªô mai. Through the content of the songs and the style of performance, x·∫©m artists told about their tragic lives or the misery of the poor people and thus evoked pity from their audience. Today, there are about 400 x·∫©m songs which are still preserved. They are mainly handed down orally from generation to generation. In singing x·∫©m, the artists often play ƒë√†n b·∫ßu or ƒë√†n nh·ªã to self-accompany, and sometimes they form a band in which one artist sings while others play traditional instruments such as the drum or ph√°ch. Depending on the rhythm of the drum, x·∫©m is divided into two styles, x·∫©m ch·ª£ for a rapid rhythm and x·∫©m c√¥ ƒë√†o for a slow one.

Silberman‚Äôs first album, Uprooted, contained nine songs which he wrote and recorded himself. It was self-released in 2006. Silberman has stated that when beginning the band as a solo project, his approach to home recording and production was largely inspired by the techniques of lo-fi musician Phil Elverum (The Microphones and Mount Eerie); in particular, that of the critically acclaimed 2001 release, The Glow Pt. 2. The follow-up album In the Attic of the Universe was also written and recorded by Silberman. It was recorded by Silberman alone between September 2006 and March 2007, and released by Fall Records on November 6, 2007, being the first Antlers album to be released with the help of a record label. When commenting on the album, Silberman noted that the album was recorded at a low point in his life, when he was able to find comfort in his fascination with the universe. This fascination led to the album's recurring theme of the universe and its vastness.\\"Ca Va Cool interview with Peter Silberman\\" Retrieved on December 3, 2009 Silberman also noted that the album carries a theme of \\"religious misdirection\\", inspired by his own tendency to find the wrong solutions to his problems in life.

The album consists of a recording of a live performance of the band at the Agora Theatre and Ballroom in Cleveland, Ohio, which had been taped for broadcast on Cleveland radio station WMMS. History In late 1976, the Dwight Twilley Band was sent on a midwestern promotional tour by Shelter Records and its new distribution partner Arista Records, in an effort to gain exposure for the band, which had been idled by the collapse of Shelter. At the time, the Cleveland Agora was located underneath Agency Recording Studios, and professional-quality recordings were made of many of the live concerts, using Agency's equipment, for radio rebroadcast. The tape of this concert was later edited for national broadcast on the King Biscuit Flower Hour, but it was not released commercially for over three decades. The band on this tour consisted of Dwight Twilley (guitar, keyboards, lead and harmony vocals), Phil Seymour (drums, percussion, lead and harmony vocals) and Bill Pitcock IV (lead guitar), with backing musicians including Bingo Sloan (bass) and Rob Armstrong (drums). The band performed five songs from its debut album Sincerely, five songs from the upcoming second album Twilley Don't Mind, two songs that ultimately appeared on The Great Lost Twilley Album and one song (\\"Betsy Sue\\") that had only been released in a Dwight Twilley solo version, even though Twilley wrote it during his teens.

The charity uses the violence prevention evidence base to target educational interventions at the contributing factors to violence.  Background  Originally called the 'Campaign for Lloyd' the campaign was set up by Adam Fouracre, the older brother of Lloyd Fouracre, who was murdered on 25 September 2005. The original agenda was to increase police presence within the local area, and also giving talks to local schools about Lloyd and the effects of violence. The campaign changed direction following a disappointing government meeting and a loss of momentum within schools. Stand Against Violence was established as a charity in 2010 and focuses on developing and delivering educational resources and workshops which are delivered as part of the PSHE/Citizenship curriculum. The aim of the core workshop is to educate young people about the effects of violence. The original resources and workshops are aimed at secondary school students and other organisations that work with young people, and includes a short film, followed by interactive activities and discussion, all of which satisfy several sections of the national curriculum. The charity also delivers: * Primary aged workshops * Anti bullying workshops * Aubstance abuse workshops * Personal safety * First aid * Workshops for young prisoners and youth offending teams  Lloyd Fouracre  17-year-old Lloyd Fouracre was leaving a friend's 18th birthday party on 25 September 2005 in Taunton, Somerset, when he and his friends were attacked by a group of youths. He was hit over the head with a wooden parking sign, rendering him unconscious. His attackers then continued to beat Lloyd until they were interrupted by a passing car. Lloyd was taken to Musgrove Park Hospital, where he was pronounced dead 30 minutes later. A post-mortem examination revealed Lloyd had suffered fractures to the skull, cheekbone, jaw, eye socket, nasal bone and suffered multiple brain haemorrhages. He was due to turn 18 on 26 September 2005, the day after he died.  The trial  The trial was held at Exeter Crown Court and lasted for four weeks. Andrew Betty and Jay Wall were both convicted of murder at Exeter Crown court on 5 August 2006. Betty was sentenced to 13 years in prison, and Wall to 12 years. Ross McCormack was cleared of murder and manslaughter. A fourth and fifth teen were also arrested, but released without charge.  Petition to the government  During the trial, Adam Fouracre, Lloyd's brother and the Taunton Deane community signed a petition, which was then presented to the Home Office Minister Paul Goggins at Downing Street. The petition called for more police on the streets, but unfortunately the meeting ended without result.  The film  Adam Fouracre then produced an education film as part of the Stand Against Violence campaign, which was funded by donations and a grant from Taunton Deane Borough Council, and was made with the help of people who gave their time and skills for free. = Synopsis = This film aims to get young people thinking about the consequences to their actions. The film re enacts the true story of the murder of Lloyd Fouracre who was brutally beaten to death in 2005. The film also contains friend and family interviews as well as home video footage and news reports. This moving, emotional short film aims to shock young people so they can see the harsh reality that is modern day violence. The re enactment is based on eye witness accounts and the information we heard in court. It is a true reconstruction with no dramatization. We wanted to show the truth in this project rather than glorify or dramatise the violence. After focusing on Lloyd‚Äôs story the film then becomes more general to give a clear, nationwide message about violence and how it is up to us to reduce it.  SAV's Evidence Base  Stand Against Violence offers workshops to organisations working with young people aged 10-25 yrs. An independent evaluation conducted by the Centre for Public Health in 2014 showed that young people who were exposed to the core violence prevention workshops showed statistically significant improvements in young peoples attitudes towards violence, with them being less likely to resort to violence as a means of conflict resolution. This was maintained for the 6 week follow up survey which shows promising evidence of long term attitude change.  PSHE  The Stand Against Violence workshops fit within the PSHE and citizenship curriculum for Key Stage 2, 3, and 4. An example of Key Stage 3 curriculum points covered include: Key Concepts * 1.1 Personal identities * 1.3 Risk * 1.4 Relationships Key Processes * 2.1 Critical reflection * 2.2 Decision-making and managing risk  SAV within the community  Stand Against Violence launched a National Day of Non-Violence in 2016. . The UN promote an international day of non-violence but there is nothing to date in the UK. Therefore to mark the anniversary of Lloyd's death and the charities inception 25 September will be a national day of non-violence. SAV promotes thi day online, using posters and distributing ribbons for people to wear to show support. In 2017 National Day of Non-Violence has been expanded for the month of September. September will now become 'Make a Stand Month' where the charity encourages people to show support and make their own Stand Against Violence through awareness raising and fundraising activities  Anne Frank Trust  Working in conjunction with The Anne Frank Trust UK, SAV has given a talk in London to young people about SAV the campaign and how it began. The Anne Frank Trust will be working with young people who want to start their own campaigns using people and organisations who already run campaigns to offer advice.  Charity Status  Stand Against Violence became a registered charity in March 2010 (charity #1135475). It has since become a Charitable Incorporated Organisation in 2015 (charity #1156451). The charity aims to maintain a board of 8-10 trustees and keep a wide skill set within the board.

The mnemic neglect model stipulates that memory is self-protective if the information is negative, self-referent, and concerns central traits. Pinter, B., Green, J.D., Sedikides, C., & Gregg, A.P. (2011) Self-protective memory: Separation/integration as a mechanism for mnemic neglect. Social Cognition, 29 (5), 612-624. Mnemic neglect model Experiments have been conducted to test for the specific conditions under which mnemic neglect occurs. A standard procedure has been used across several experiments to test for these conditions. In this procedure, participants are presented with a list of 32 behavioral traits. They are asked to either encode each trait as if it applied to them (i.e. \\"consider people describing you with these traits\\") or as if it applied to a stranger named Chris (i.e. \\"consider people describing Chris with these traits\\"). Several of these experiments have found that the first condition under which mnemic neglect occurs is that the traits must be negative. Feedback from others is less easily recalled when it is negative in nature than when it is positive. Second, the information must be self- referent. Sedikides and Green (2004) conducted a study using the standard procedure in which half of the participants were asked to consider feedback as if it applied to them and half were asked to consider the same feedback as if it applied to someone else. They found that negative feedback was recalled as frequently as positive feedback when the feedback was directed at another. However, when the feedback was directed at oneself, negative feedback was recalled less frequently than positive feedback. Third, the information must pertain to a central, rather than peripheral, self-conception. A central self- conception is a generally positive trait that is considered fixed and highly descriptive (i.e. trustworthy vs. untrustworthy). In contrast, a peripheral self-conception is considered only moderately descriptive, less positive, and less important (i.e. modest vs. immodest). Feedback that counteracts a central self-conception is recalled much less frequently than feedback that counteracts a peripheral self-conception. In fact, the recall for feedback on modifiable traits was unaffected by whether the feedback was positive or negative.Green, J.D., Pinter, B., & Sedikides, C. (2005). Mnemic neglect and self-threat: Trait modifiability moderates self-protection. European Journal of Social Psychology, 35 (2), 225-235. Hypothesized mechanism Sedikides and Green (2004) offered a mechanism by which they believe mnemic neglect occurs. Self-referent information is processed in two stages. The first stage checks the information for compatibility with self-concept. Self-threatening information is confined to this stage because it is found to be incompatible with self-concept. During the second stage, self-flattering information is compared to similar episodic memories. The theory is that deeper processing occurs at the second stage, so information processed at this stage is recalled more easily.Sedikides, C., & Green, J.D. (2004). What I don‚Äôt recall can‚Äôt hurt me: Information negativity versus information inconsistency as determinants of memorial self-defense. Social Cognition, 22 (1), 4-29. Although research has demonstrated a difference in recall between threatening and non-threatening information, there is no difference in recognition of threatening and non-threatening information.Wyer, R. S., Jr., Bodenhausen, G. V., & Srull, T.K. (1984). The cognitive representation of persons and groups and its effect on recall and recognition memory. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 20, 445-469. In other words, self-threatening information is recalled less easily than non-threatening information but it is recognized equally well, meaning that subjects can identify whether they received the information or not regardless of its connotations. However, in a free recall task, subjects show a memory bias for non-threatening information. To account for this difference, Pinter, Green, Sedikides, and Gregg (2011) modified the suggested mechanism behind mnemic neglect. They hypothesized that people compare incoming information to past experience. If the information is consistent with self-knowledge, then the information is integrated with this knowledge. If the information is inconsistent with self-knowledge, then it is processed separately. Therefore, self-threatening information is less easily recalled but just as easily recognized as non-threatening information because separate processing leads to fewer retrieval routes. This mechanism was tested by Pinter and his colleagues experimentally. Half of the participants were prompted to incorporate the information they were given into their self- concept. They were instructed to find similarities between the information and their self-knowledge and determine reasons for why the information described them. This process was termed integration. The other half of the participants were prompted to separate the information from their self-concept. They were asked to identify differences between the information and their self-knowledge and determine reasons for why the information did not describe them. This process was termed separation. The first finding of the experiment was that recall for both positive and negative information was poorer for separation than for integration. However, recognition was the same between the two groups. The second finding was that self-protection is more important than self-enhancement. A greater effect was seen for attempting to integrate central negative information than for attempting to separate central positive information. This mechanism has been challenged by those who believe that mnemic neglect is a product of expectancies rather than self-protection motives.Swann, W. B. Jr. (1983). Self-verification: Bringing social reality into harmony with the self. In Psychological perspectives on the self, 2, 33‚Äì66. In other words, negative information is not processed as deeply as positive information because it is incompatible with self-concept as opposed to simply unflattering. People do not recall a behavior describing them that indicates untrustworthiness not because they want to protect themselves but because this behavior is inconsistent with how they would actually behave. This alternative explanation accounts for the absence of memory bias in recalling information about a stranger (Chris). People have no expectancies about this stranger Chris, so positive and negative information are processed equally well.Newman, L.S., Nibert, J.A., & Winer, E.S. (2009). Mnemic neglect is not an artifact of expectancy: The moderating role of defensive pessimism. European Journal of Social Psychology, 39 (3), 477-486 Newman, Nibert, and Winer (2009) emphasized ruling out the possibility that mnemic neglect occurs due to incompatibility with expectancies. It was suspected that mnemic neglect might be an issue of self-verification rather than self-protection or self- enhancement. Self-verification and self-protection are difficult concepts to separate because most people tend to think of themselves favorably.Taylor, S. E., & Brown, J. D. (1988). Illusion and well-being: A social psychological perspective on mental health. Psychological Bulletin, 103, 193‚Äì210. Green and Sedikides (2004) attempted to address this concern by conducting two experiments. In one experiment, the participants were pre-selected. Half viewed themselves positively on certain dimensions and half viewed themselves negatively. All participants had better recall for positive dimensions. In another experiment, a stranger Chris was described to participants before they read the behaviors. Chris was described as a superhuman, incredibly kind and trustworthy, in an attempt to establish expectancies about Chris. Other participants in the same study were asked to imagine the traits described a close friend whom the participants hold in high regard. In comparison to these two cases, recall for positive traits was still better when these traits were self-referent rather than directed at another.Green, J. D., & Sedikides, C. (2004). Retrieval selectivity in the processing of self-referent information: Testing the boundaries of selfprotection. Self and Identity, 3, 69‚Äì80. Despite these findings, the mechanism was still challenged because the results were open to interpretation. Perhaps participants had more favorable expectancies for themselves than for others. Newman, Nibert, and Winer (2009) sought to test the expectancies possibility more directly. They hypothesized that participants who were more focused on testing information against their expectancies would have different recall biases than participants who were more likely to be focused on self-protection. Defensive pessimists were identified as people who are more likely to focus on expectancies. Defensive pessimists think extensively about possible future outcomes, both positive and negative. Their ultimate goal is to be prepared. They should still exhibit a preference for positive over negative information, but they are more likely to approach a situation with ‚ÄúIs this a reasonable thing to expect?‚Äù as opposed to ‚ÄúWill this make me feel bad about myself?‚Äù Thus, it was hypothesized that defensive pessimists would recall more favorable than unfavorable behaviors in both themselves and others when subjected to the standard test for mnemic neglect. The findings supported the hypothesis. Defensive pessimists showed a bias for the recall of positive information over negative information for both themselves and others, thereby offering further support to the hypothesized mechanism of mnemic neglect (i.e. mnemic neglect is based on self-protection rather than self-verification). Evidence against hypothesized mechanism The recollection of autobiographical memories can trigger emotions. Research shows that the intensity of the emotion experienced at the time of the event decreases over time, such that the intensity of the emotion associated with the recollection of the event is less than the intensity of the emotion experienced during the event.Hartnett, J. L., & Skowronski, J. J. (2008). Tragic to hilarious: Why do some negative autobiographical memories become funny? Presented at the 80th Annual Meeting of the MidwesternPsychological Association, Chicago, IL, May 2008. The fading affect bias is a phenomenon in which emotions associated with a negative event fade faster than emotions associated with a positive event. Like mnemic neglect, the fading affect bias is hypothesized to promote positive self-concept. Despite the similarities between mnemic neglect and fading affect bias, the hypothesized mechanisms of fading affect bias differ from that of mnemic neglect. One hypothesized mechanism of fading affect bias is that negative experiences are gradually reinterpreted as transformative events.Levine, L. J., & Bluck, S. (2004). How emotions fade: Valence, appraisals, and the emotional impact of remembered events. Advances in psychology research, 30, 3‚Äì20. In the process, these memories lose emotional intensity. For example, people often reinterpret hardships as opportunities to experience personal growth. A second hypothesized mechanism suggests that the conveying of autobiographical events to others minimizes negative aspects of the story and emphasizes positive aspects. In fact, a study by Skowronski, Gibbons, Vogl, and Walker (2004) demonstrated that fading affect bias is stronger for events frequently disclosed to others. Both of these mechanisms suggest that the superior retention of positive emotions over negative emotions is not a function of initial coding. Rather, poorer retention of negative emotions may be a function of recoding over time.Walker, W.R., & Skowronski, J.L. (2009). The fading affect bias: But what the hell is it for? Applied Cognitive Psychology, 23 (8), 1122-1136. Limits of the mnemic neglect model: selective nature of self-protection One limitation of the mnemic neglect model is its inability to explain why people respond to negative information differently. Why is it that sometimes people react to negative feedback with defensive anger and other times with thoughtful reflection? Green, Sedikides, Pinter, and Van Tongeren (2009) conducted two experiments to determine the boundaries of mnemic neglect. They hypothesized that the self-protection aspect of mnemic neglect is flexible and that the mnemic neglect model is only upheld under certain conditions. More specifically, these researchers hypothesized that mnemic neglect does not occur when there is an opportunity for self- improvement and when feedback concerning an individual‚Äôs personality is provided in the context of a close relationship. In their first experiment, these researchers tested the effect motivation to improve the self has on mnemic neglect. They hypothesized that mnemic neglect would not be observed in individuals motivated to enhance themselves because this motivation leads to deeper processing which in turn creates more retrieval routes. In this experiment, half of the participants were exposed to a task aimed to prime them for self-motivation. The other half was not exposed to this task. After the priming task, all of the participants were exposed to the standard test for mnemic neglect in which they were asked to read through a list of personality traits. Some were asked to imagine that the traits applied to them while others were asked to imagine that the traits applied to another named Chris. In the condition where self-improvement was primed, self-threatening and self-affirming information were recalled equally. Researchers believe that the findings of this experiment indicate the existence of a balance between the desire to protect oneself and the desire to improve oneself. In their second experiment, participants signed up as pairs. Half of the participants were assigned to work with their partner while the other half were assigned to work with strangers. One of the partners completed a personality test. The other partner received the first partner‚Äôs answers to the personality test and rated each of the responses as either positive or negative. The first participant then had an opportunity to review each of their partner‚Äôs positive/negative ratings. After a brief distractor test, the first participant was asked to recall as many of their partner‚Äôs feedback ratings as possible. Researchers found that when the two partners had a close relationship, mnemic neglect was not demonstrated. When the two partners were strangers, mnemic neglect was maintained. Green, Sedikides, Pinter, and Van Tongeren admit that further research must be conducted to determine the mechanism behind the effect relationships have on mnemic neglect. Feedback from close friends may be more useful because individuals feel more comfortable to use the feedback constructively if it is provided within a supportive relationship. An alternative explanation is that recalling feedback from a friend may be important for maintaining a healthy relationship. However, a third explanation is that individuals commit this feedback to memory so that they may better prepare counterarguments for the future. This research opens the door for future research to investigate individual differences in order to create a list of moderator variables that affect mnemic neglect.Green, J.D., Sedikides, C., Pinter, B., & Van Tongeren, D.R. (2009). Two sides to self-protection: Self-improvement strivings and feedback from close relationships eliminate mnemic neglect. Self and Identity, 8 (2-3), 233-250. Mnemic neglect and dysphoria Mood can affect cognitive performance. Research has demonstrated that individuals with dysphoria recall negative information more easily than positive informationBurt, D. B., Zembar, M. J., & Niederehe, G. (1995). Depression and memory impairment. A meta analysis of the association, its pattern, and specificity. Psychological Bulletin, 117, 285-305. Saunders (2011) conducted three experiments to determine the relationship between dysphoria and mnemic neglect. In the first experiment, it was hypothesized that dysphoric patients are prone to malfunctioning mnemic neglect. They suffer from the inability to forget negative information. Thus, they should have better recall for self- threatening information than nondysphoric individuals. Participants were subjects to the standard mnemic neglect test procedure. It was determined that people with dysphoria have greater recall for central negative information. It was further hypothesized that a defect in mnemic neglect leads to more negative memories. Experiment 1 also indicated that dysphoria patients had better recall for central negative information than peripheral negative information. Thus, it was hypothesized a reverse mnemic neglect model in dysphoria patients. For the second experiment, the same traits were presented to two separate groups of dysphoria patients. The first group received information before receiving the list of traits that described the traits as all unmodifiable, meaning that if one exhibits the trait as a child, he or she will certainly exhibit the trait as an adult. The second group received information that described the traits as all modifiable, meaning that if one exhibits the trait as a child, he or she can change as an adult. It was concluded that dysphoria patients recall unmodifiable traits better than they do modifiable traits. In Experiment 3, it was hypothesized that individuals with dysphoria would demonstrate better recall for highly diagnostic behaviors than low diagnostic behaviors. A highly diagnostic behavior is one that is very descriptive of a trait. For instance, ‚ÄúI can keep secrets‚Äù is highly diagnostic of the trait trustworthiness. A low diagnostic behavior for trustworthiness might be ‚ÄúI would take a pen from a bank after using it‚Äù. This experiment followed the same procedure as Experiment 1 except that half of the dysphoria patients were presented highly diagnostic behaviors and half were presented low diagnostic behaviors. As expected, the participants negative information was more easily recalled when the information was highly diagnostic as opposed to low diagnostic. Saunders explains her findings by suggesting that self-referent, negative, central information receives elaboration form dysphoric patients. They process this information more deeply than nondysphoric patients. In addition, individuals with dysphoria may have inhibitory deficits, where they are unable to keep negative information from flooding their conscious minds. These difficulties in suppressing negative memories could explain why the negative mood is sustained. Dysphoric patients rated central negative traits just as negative as nondysphoric patients did, but they rated these traits as more important. It has been argued that the differences in mnemic neglect between individuals with and without dysphoria can be explained by mood-dependent memory (link). Simply, individuals with dysphoria believe that negative information is more self-referent than positive information. However, Saunders argues that there are effects beyond mood-dependent memory because the same effect would be seen for peripheral negative information, which in fact saw no difference in recall between the two groups. She also emphasizes that she would not have observed differences for modifiability and diagnosticity either if this were the case.Saunders, J. (2011). Reversed mnemic neglect of self-threatening memories in dysphoria. Cognition & Emotion, 25 (5), 854-867. Mnemic neglect and anxiety There is evidence that individuals with anxiety also experience reverse mnemic neglect. Many studies have found no difference in memory bias between anxious and non- anxious individuals,Dalgliesh, T. (1994). The relationship between anxiety and memory biases for material that has been selectively processed in a prior task. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 32, 227-231 but these studies have been criticized for using traits low in self-reference.Saunders, J. (2013). Selective memory bias for self-threatening memories in trait anxiety. Cognition & Emotion, 27(1), 21-36 A meta-analysis conducted by Mitte (2008) found that anxious individuals have better recall than non-anxious individuals for negative information and that non-anxious individuals have better recall than anxious individuals for neutral and positive information.Mitte, K. (2008). Memory bias for self-threatening information in anxiety and anxiety disorders: A meta-analytic review. Psychological Bulletin, 134, 886-911 Saunders (2013) hypothesized that highly anxious individuals have better recall for central, negative traits than non-anxious individuals. A series of three experiments was conducted. Experiment 1 used the standard mnemic neglect procedure to compare the recall for various traits between high-anxious participants and low-anxious participants. As hypothesized, high-anxious participants showed greater recall than did low-anxious participants for central, negative traits. Experiment 2 tested for the recall of highly diagnostic traits. It was hypothesized that high-anxious participants would show mnemic neglect for modifiable traits because these traits are not perceived as very threatening. However, unmodifiable traits would be immune to mnemic neglect for these participants and thus they would be recalled more easily. In this experiment, traits were either presented following a description of the traits as being changeable over time or following a description of the traits as being unalterable throughout life. As hypothesized, anxious participants were able to recall more unmodifiable than modifiable central negative traits. It was hypothesized that anxious participants have better recall for highly diagnostic central negative traits. Diagnosticity refers to how well a behavior indicates an underlying trait. In experiment 3, both anxious and non-anxious participants were asked to rate how diagnostic each behavior was of a trait (i.e. Based on this behavior, how likely is it that this person is trustworthy?). No difference in diagnostic ratings was found between the two groups. However, anxious participants had higher recall than non-anxious participants for highly diagnostic central negative traits when they directed at themselves. Thus, reverse mnemic neglect is experienced for unmodifiable and highly diagnostic traits among high- anxious individuals.

The network was first launched on October 7, 1996 though a joint venture with Silver King/HSN, Inc. (now known as IAC) as Discovery Kids Channel, a spin-off of Discovery Channel that featured science, nature and adventure-themed programs aimed towards children aged 6 to 11. In April 2009, Hasbro announced a joint venture with Discovery, Inc. and IAC to relaunch Discovery Kids as The Hub (later Hub Network) on October 10, 2010; Hasbro handled programming while Discovery and IAC's Mindspark division handled distribution and advertising sales. The Hub was intended to be a general, youth-oriented network with a diverse lineup, primarily featuring programming adapted from Hasbro franchises (such as Transformers, its board games, My Little Pony, Pound Puppies, and Littlest Pet Shop) along with other family-oriented programs such as sitcom reruns and films. On September 25, 2014, following reports earlier in the year that Hub Network president Margaret Loesch would step down by the end of the year, Discovery acquired 10% of Hasbro's stake in the network resulting in IAC/InterActiveCorp divesting its stake after almost 18 years, and replaced Loesch with Henry Schleiff, who leads sister networks such as Destination America and Investigation Discovery. On October 13, 2014, Hub Network was re-branded as Discovery Family to which Hasbro remains a minority partner and programs the network's daytime lineup with children's programs carried over from Hub Network, while its prime-time lineup was replaced with reruns of non-fiction programs from Discovery Channel's library, including science and nature programs.  History = As Discovery Kids Channel/Discovery Kids (1996‚Äì2010)  Discovery Communications launched Discovery Kids Channel though a joint venture with Silver King/HSN, Inc. (then USA Networks, now known as IAC) on October 7, 1996, as part of a suite of four new digital cable channels that included Discovery Travel & Living, Discovery Civilization, and Science Channel. Upon its launch, the network primarily offered adventure, nature, and science-themed programs aimed towards a children's audience between ages 6 and 11. Marjorie Kaplan, the network's senior vice president, explained that the creation of Discovery Kids was influenced primarily by kids, who were watching its parent network's programming together with their parents. From 1996 until 2000, Discovery Kids was carried by only a select few cable television providers. By late 2001, the channel was carried in at least 15 million homes. In September 2001, a Canadian version of Discovery Kids was launched in partnership with Corus Entertainment. In December 2001, Discovery Kids announced a partnership with NBC, in which it would produce a new Saturday morning block for the network known as Discovery Kids on NBC, beginning in September 2002. The block, which replaced a teen-oriented block consisting only of sitcoms, featured programming that met the U.S. Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) educational programming guidelines, including new original series (such as the reality television series Endurance), existing Discovery Kids programming, along with children's spin-offs of programs from sister networks, such as Animal Planet and Discovery Channel. With the launch of the new block, Discovery Kids also branched out into animated programming with the premieres of Kenny the Shark and Tutenstein. In March 2006, Discovery and IAC/InterActiveCorp declined to renew their contract with NBC for their Saturday morning block, citing a desire to focus exclusively on the Discovery Kids cable channel. Since the launch of the NBC block, Discovery Kids had grown its cable carriage to over 43 million homes. NBC would replace the Discovery Kids block with Qubo in September 2006.  As The Hub/Hub Network (2010‚Äì2014)  Development = On April 30, 2009, toy manufacturer and multimedia company Hasbro announced that it would be forming a joint venture with Discovery Communications to relaunch Discovery Kids as a new family- oriented television channel, paying $300 million for 50% ownership of the network originally controlled by IAC/InterActiveCorp. Under the arrangement, Discovery and Mindspark Interactive Network would be in charge of handling advertising sales and distribution for the new service, while Hasbro would be involved in acquiring and producing programming. While educational series (including those carried over from Discovery Kids) were slated to be maintained on the schedule, plans called for new original programs based on Hasbro-owned franchises such as G.I. Joe, My Little Pony, Transformers and game shows adapted from its board game brands. Discovery Communications and IAC's shareholders were looking for a business partner to draw the improved types of advertisers on the channel. In July 2009, the joint venture, as well as IAC's shareholders, appointed veteran television executive Margaret Loesch as its chief executive officer; prior to this, Loesch served as president and CEO of Marvel Productions from 1984 to 1990, assisting in the production of several Hasbro-based cartoons such as G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero, My Little Pony 'n Friends, and The Transformers. In January 2010, Discovery, IAC/InterActiveCorp and Hasbro announced that the new network would be known as The Hub; this was soon followed two months later with the announcement that The Hub would be launched on October 10, 2010 (nicknamed \\"10/10/10\\"). The network's original imaging was developed by Troika Design Group and built around an emblem nicknamed the \\"hubble\\" ‚Äì which was designed to embody a \\"catalyst of action and imagination\\". The final logo design was the result of a number of drafts by Troika designers, some of which had incorporated typography similar to Hasbro's logo. The relaunched channel, which would still compete against established children services such as Cartoon Network, Disney Channel, and Nickelodeon, planned to continue targeting Discovery Kids' main demographic of children aged 2‚Äì12 (a market which staff felt was being abandoned by its competitors in favor of tweens) but also planned to feature a prime-time block with family-oriented programming; it was originally targeted at pre-teens and teenagers aged 9‚Äì14. Launch programming included the game show Family Game Night, animated television series Pound Puppies, My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic ‚Äì a new animated entry in the My Little Pony franchise in which Lauren Faust served as the developer of the series, and Deltora Quest alongside reruns of the Jim Henson series Fraggle Rock and the preschool-oriented programs Animal Mechanicals and The WotWots. The channel promised to keep the proportion of programs supplied from Hasbro to \\"less than 20%\\" of the total of its programming. The Children's Television Act (CTA) in the United States limits the commercial time during children's programming, and prohibits television broadcasters from airing advertisements for products associated with a program during or in timeslots adjacent to the show itself. During timeslots that targeted preschool audiences, The Hub was to broadcast six minutes of advertisements per hour, below 12 minutes per hour on weekdays, and 10.5 minutes per hour on weekends as mandated by the CTA. Additionally, it was planning to broadcast 10.5 minutes of advertisements per hour the rest of the day throughout the week, a policy upheld from its previous incarnation as Discovery Kids. The channel was planning to sell its advertising inventories to toy companies other than Hasbro as well; as reported by Advertising Age in May 2010, The Hub was even in talks with Mattel, one of Hasbro's major competitors in the toy industry. The channel, however, also planned to restrict certain categories of advertisements, including junk foods and \\"advertisers in the sugar category\\". There have been reported concerns that the channel would be exploited by Hasbro as a platform to plug its products. Ahead of the channel's relaunch as The Hub, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC) called the whole project an \\"infomercial\\", and stated that they would be monitoring the channel. CCFC founder Susan Linn said \\"It will make a mockery of existing ad limits and the current prohibition of product placement in children's television\\" at the April 2009 announcement of the Discovery-Hasbro joint venture, and told Los Angeles Times that \\"[t]he notion of a toy company owning a television channel for the sole purpose of promoting their toys is egregious practice\\" in the days before the channel's relaunch. Loesch stated that The Hub's goal was to be \\"vibrant\\" and \\"diverse\\" in its programming, and that the channel would not purely be a marketing vehicle for Hasbro products. Loesch also said that Hasbro was partnering with Discovery Communications for the channel, and declared \\"we have programming from them and are using their DNA\\". = Launch and later years = To promote The Hub, sneak previews of Cosmic Quantum Ray, The Twisted Whiskers Show, and Family Game Night aired on Science Channel, Animal Planet, and TLC respectively.https://animesuperhero.com/forums/threads/the-hubs-schedule- for-10-10-10-11-men-in-black-the-series-is-coming.5037321/page-2 Discovery Kids' relaunch as The Hub was preceded by a marathon of Kenny the Shark (broadcast under the @DK block), running from 6:00 to 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Immediately after, The Hub debuted with \\"Sneak Peak Sunday\\", a sampler lineup of programs set to air on the channel in the coming months. The Twisted Whiskers Show was the first program to air of the channel, followed by episodes of Dennis and Gnasher, Cosmic Quantum Ray, Atomic Betty, and the network premiere of the 2004 film Garfield: The Movie. In a June 2011 debt filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Discovery Communications indicated that the channel may be worth less than previously believed, based on low viewership figures. The management of The Hub subsequently underwent a fair value analysis of the channel. A Discovery Communications spokesperson considered the action to be \\"a pro-forma accounting exercise\\", and noted that Discovery felt \\"very positive and encouraged by The Hub's early days' performance, and ability to grow its audience in the future.\\" In March 2013, The Hub picked up Stan Lee's Mighty 7, an animated pilot film to be aired in early 2014. The network also began to phase in an amended branding as the Hub Network. In early 2014, Hub Network introduced an updated logo, along with a new imaging campaign, \\"Making Family Fun\\", which was developed by the Los Angeles-based agency Oishii Creative.  As Discovery Family (2014‚Äìpresent)  On June 12, 2014, it was reported that Margaret Loesch would step down from her role as Hub Network president and CEO by the end of the year. On September 17, 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that Discovery Communications was preparing to acquire a controlling stake in Hub Network from Hasbro and then retool it as Discovery Family, resulting in IAC's shareholders divesting their stakes in the rebranded network. Along with Discovery's CFO Andrew Warren, Hasbro staff acknowledged that increasing competition in the children's media landscape ‚Äì especially by subscription video-on-demand services such as Netflix ‚Äì had an effect on the overall performance of the network and Hasbro's original content. As it was majority- owned by a competitor, other major toy companies such as Mattel refused to purchase advertising time on Hub Network, affecting its ability to air advertising that targeted its main audience; by 2014, the network had made only $9 million per year. Discovery staff was also unable to display a full commitment to Hub Network's operation, due to factors such as the troubled launch of the Oprah Winfrey Network. Believing that they had overvalued its stake in the venture, Hasbro decided to cede the operation of the network to Discovery so it could focus more on content, and its core toy business. Discovery and Hasbro publicly announced the planned re-branding on September 25, 2014, Hasbro's CEO Brian Goldner explained that Discovery Family would be the \\"next chapter\\" in its joint venture with Discovery, \\"[combining] highly rated award-winning storytelling around Hasbro's brands and Discovery's most popular non-fiction shows that appeal to both children and families alike.\\" Hub Network was re-launched as Discovery Family on October 13, 2014 ‚Äì just over four years since the original launch of The Hub. With these changes, Discovery Communications now holds a 60% stake in the joint venture; Hasbro continues to hold a 40% stake in Discovery Family, and continues to program the network's daytime lineup with children's programming, while the network's former owner IAC/InterActiveCorp shifted its focus to its online business. Following the re-launch, the network's primetime lineup was replaced by reruns of family-oriented factual programming from Discovery Channel's library. Henry Schleiff, who leads sister networks such as Destination America and Investigation Discovery, leads the re-launched network, with Tom Cosgrove (who previously served as CEO of Discovery Channel and Science) as general manager. In re-launching Hub Network, Discovery executives noted that there would be a larger emphasis on programming of interest to both children and their parents; Warren argued that since ABC Family had become, in his opinion, aimed towards teenage girls, there was a gap in the broadcasting industry for a new, family- oriented network. With these shifts in the network's operation, it was announced on October 7, 2014 that Transformers: Robots in Disguise ‚Äì a sequel to Transformers: Prime that had been scheduled to premiere on Hub Network, would instead air on Cartoon Network. Hasbro Studios president Stephen Davis felt that Cartoon Network was a more appropriate home for a Transformers series due to its male-oriented demographics, describing Hub Network's lineup as being \\"traditionally skewed towards girls\\". Other recent Transformers animated series preceding the original launch of The Hub also aired on Cartoon Network. Davis remarked that Hasbro was still \\"100% committed\\" to its joint venture with Discovery. Despite the move for Robots in Disguise, fellow Hub Network Transformers series Transformers: Rescue Bots remained on Discovery Family for its third season.  Programming  Hasbro Studios (Burbank, California headquarters pictured) supplies much of the network's programming. The majority of Discovery Family's daytime programs are animated and live- action series tied to media franchises owned by Hasbro itself, with newer series produced through the Hasbro Studios division, such as Pound Puppies and Transformers: Rescue Bots. As the Hub Network, it also previously aired game shows tied to Hasbro's board games, such as Family Game Night. One of the network's most noteworthy series has been My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, an animated series produced as a part of the then-recent reboot of Hasbro's My Little Pony franchise. The series not only became The Hub's highest-rated program within its target demographic of young girls, but attracted an unexpectedly significant cult following among male teens and adults. Following the conclusion of the series in 2019, it was announced that an animated spin- off series featuring its cast, My Little Pony: Pony Life, will premiere on Discovery Family on November 7, 2020. The Hatchery ‚Äì a company co-founded by Margaret Loesch (who have served as the channel's president and CEO from 2009 until 2014) and Bruce Stein in 2003, and have its major stake acquired by American Greetings in 2004 ‚Äì have supplied certain series to the channel, including Dan Vs. and R. L. Stine's The Haunting Hour. Aside from The Hatchery's productions, American Greetings have also supplied Strawberry Shortcake's Berry Bitty Adventures (part of the 2009 relaunch of Strawberry Shortcake, a property which was owned by AG until 2015), The Twisted Whiskers Show, Maryoku Yummy, and Care Bears: Welcome to Care-a-Lot to the channel, having named Hasbro as the master toy licensee of Care Bears and Strawberry Shortcake in 2008. The channel has also acquired new series unrelated to properties of Hasbro, The Hatchery and American Greetings, including Animal Mechanicals, The Aquabats! Super Show!, Cosmic Quantum Ray, Majors & Minors, Sabrina: Secrets of a Teenage Witch, Secret Millionaires Club, and SheZow. During its years as the Hub Network, the channel also aired reruns of other outside series, such as Fraggle Rock and Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, a collection of various Warner Bros. Animation series, such as Batman Beyond, Batman: The Animated Series, Superman: The Animated Series, Animaniacs, and Tiny Toon Adventures, a few former Fox Kids shows such as Goosebumps and Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation, and various off-network sitcoms (at the end of the Hub Network's run, these included Blossom, Step by Step, and Sister, Sister); Blossom, the only sitcom on Discovery Family's schedule, returned for a time in 2016. A limited amount of original Discovery Kids programming, such as Adventure Camp and Flight 29 Down, remained on the lineup upon its launch as The Hub.  Primetime and overnight programming since October 2014  Following the relaunch as Discovery Family in October 2014, the channel's primetime and overnight lineup was replaced with family- oriented science and nature-related programs from its sister network Discovery Channel such as Africa, Extreme Engineering: Big Reveals, Flying Wild Alaska, and Time Warp. The original programs commissioned for the channel in this timeslot include Bake It Like Buddy, From Wags to Riches with Bill Berloni, My Dog's Crazy Animal Friends, Reno, Set, Go!, Secrets of America's Favorite Places, and UniChef.  Availability  As of September 2018, approximately 55,238,000 American households (50.9% of households with television) receive Discovery Family. Discovery Family operates one feed nationally, and does not operate a timeshift feed for the west coast. A 1080i high-definition simulcast of the network was introduced alongside its re-launch as The Hub, with Dish Network, Verizon FiOS, and AT&T; U-verse as the first to carry the HD feed.  International versions  On March 31, 2016, the pan-EMEA version of Discovery World was re-launched as a regional version of Discovery Family. On September 14, 2017, a French version of Discovery Family was launched in France. The pan-EMEA and French versions of Discovery Family do not carry child-oriented programs, as those supplying such programs to Discovery Family in the United States (including Hasbro) has pre-existing deals with other international networks.

A number of public figures died in the earthquake, including government officials, clergy members, musicians, together with foreign civilian and military personnel working with the United Nations. On 15 January, the Red Cross estimated the death toll at between 45,000 and 50,000, however by 24 January, Communications Minister Marie- Laurence Jocelyn Lassegue said the death toll was over 150,000 in the Port-au- Prince metropolitan area alone. Haitian president Ren√© Pr√©val reported on 27 January that \\"nearly 170,000\\" bodies had been counted. On 21 February, Preval raised that estimate to 300,000. In February, prime minister Jean-Max Bellerive estimated that 300,000 had been injured. Speaking in Miami in June 2010, Bellerive also estimated the number of deaths had been 300,000. On the first anniversary of the quake, Bellerive raised the death toll to 316,000. He said that was, in part, because of the recovery of additional bodies. A University of Michigan study in 2010 estimated about 160,000 deaths. Background USGS intensity map The earthquake occurred on 12 January 2010 approximately WSW from the country's capital Port-au-Prince at 16:53 UTC-5 on the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault system.\\"Magnitude 7.0 ‚Äì HAITI REGION Tectonic Summary\\" . United States Geological Survey. 12 January 2010 The earthquake was measured a magnitude of 7.0 Mw earthquake and was followed by a series of aftershocks, fourteen of them between magnitudes 5.0 and 5.9. The main area affected by the quake was Port-au-Prince and the surrounding region, although it was also felt in several surrounding countries and regions including Cuba, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, and the neighbouring country of Dominican Republic.\\"PAGER ‚Äì M 7.0 ‚Äì HAITI REGION\\" . United States Geological Survey. 12 January 2010\\"Magnitude 7.0 ‚Äì HAITI REGION USGS Community Internet Intensity Map\\" . United States Geological Survey. 12 January 2010. No casualties were reported outside of Haiti. Much of Port-au-Prince's infrastructure was significantly damaged or destroyed in the earthquake, including the Presidential Palace, the National Assembly building, the Port- au-Prince Cathedral, hospitals, schools and the main prison. All hospitals were destroyed or so badly damaged that they were abandoned. In addition, the facilities of foreign governments and non-government organizations were badly damaged in the quake, including the headquarters of the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), which was destroyed. Calculating casualties Calculating the exact number of casualties in the earthquake is an \\"impossible\\" task due to the mass number of victims and a lack of a centralized system for tabulating casualties. In the weeks following the earthquake there were a number of estimate figures, ranging from the low tens of thousands to the hundreds of thousands. On 12 January, Haitian prime minister Jean-Max Bellerive stated that the death toll could be \\"well over 100,000\\". On 15 January, the Red Cross stated that 40,000‚Äì50,000 may have died, while Haitian interior minister Paul Antoine Bien-Aim√© estimated that the dead were between 100,000‚Äì200,000. On 17 January, Bien-Aim√© stated that there were \\"around 50,000 dead bodies\\" and \\"there will be between 100,000 and 200,000 dead in total, although we will never know the exact number.\\" Prime Minister Bellerive then announced that over 70,000 bodies have been buried in mass graves. Several days after the quake Haitian authorities estimated the number of injured at 250,000. According to Belgian disaster emergency medicine expert Claude de Ville de Goyet \\"round numbers are a sure sign that nobody knows.\\" Haitian president Ren√© Pr√©val reported on 27 January that \\"nearly 170,000\\" bodies had been counted. On 10 February the Haitian government reported the death toll to have reached 230,000. However, an investigation by Radio Netherlands has questioned the official death toll, reporting an estimate of 92,000 deaths as being a more realistic figure. Other officials did not even attempt to provide a casualty estimate. Edmond Mulet, who was appointed head of the United Nations after the quake, stated that \\"I don‚Äôt think we will ever know what the death toll is from this earthquake.\\" And the director of the Haitian Red Cross, Guiteau Jean-Pierre, noted that his organization didn't \\"have time to count\\" bodies, as they were too busy trying to treat survivors. The complications of coming up with an accurate casualty count were revealed in an interview by The New York Times reporters with the employees at the mortuary in the largest hospital in Port-au-Prince. In the interview, Alix Lassegue, the head physician at the morgue, provided a rough estimate of the number of bodies that had been passed through the mortuary by tabulating the square yardage of the area where bodies had been placed and the space that each body occupied times the number of times bodies were removed from the grounds. Lassegue's estimate was an even 10,000. Other employees estimated the number of bodies that had passed through the morgue as 75,000, 50,000 and 25,000. Compounding the problem of calculating casualties was that people were burying the dead in informal graves and many bodies had been thrown into dumps outside the city. In addition, thousands of people were leaving areas affected by the earthquake, without any centralized method of tabulating who had left. The most reliable academic estimate of the number of earthquake casualties in Haiti (over 95% were in the immediate Port-au-Prince area) \\"within six weeks of the earthquake\\" appears to be the 160,000 estimate in a 2010 University of Michigan study. An alternative method that may be used to tabulate casualties is by using the satellite imagery of Port-au-Prince located on Google Maps so that destroyed buildings can be catalogued and an estimate of casualties can be calculated using data on the inhabitants. But this method is complicated by the fact that such data may be inaccurate and infectious diseases, such as dysentery, malaria and dengue fever, could take their toll on survivors. A statistical study by a specialist group at the Children's Hospital Los Angeles and the University of Southern California estimated that the number of children injured was 110,000, or roughly half the total number of injuries. There were reports of more precise numbers of casualties for certain areas of the country. On 18 January, Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development (ACTED) reported that 145 had died and 380 were wounded in Jacmel, the country's fourth largest city located in the south of Haiti. Some other local communal leaders were attempting to count the number of dead in their community. The New York Times reported that in the Edmond Paul region in southern Port-au-Prince, lawyer and community leader Isaac Jean Widner was organizing a list of the dead. Widner estimated that of the 3,000 people that had lived in his neighborhood before the quake, 1,000 had died, but he added that \\"between the exodus and those still trapped it was impossible to confirm.\\" Response and treatment of casualties US Coast Guard personnel carry an injured woman onto the loading ramp of an HC-130 Hercules aircraft, 14 January 2010, before departing for the Dominican Republic. The earthquake struck in the most populated area of the country and the International Red Cross estimated that as many as 3 million people have been affected by the quake, including injuries and deaths. One factor that contributed to the number casualties in the aftermath of the earthquake was a lack of medical supplies, damage to hospitals, and a shortage of medical and rescue personnel. In addition, Haitian and foreign medical staff, police, and military personnel themselves became victims of the earthquake. An example of this was Port-au-Prince's Grace Children's Hospital, where it was reported on 19 January that of 120 employees, only six had been accounted for and some had been confirmed killed. Soon after the quake struck appeals for international aid were issued by Haitian government officials, including Raymond Joseph, Haiti's ambassador to the United States. Neighboring Dominican Republic was one of the first countries to give aid to Haiti. And the non-governmental organization Giving Children Hope distributed much-needed medicines and supplies. International organization also began large-scale fund raising campaigns for aid to Haiti, including campaigns by the International Red Cross and relief charities in Britain. On 25 January Handicap International published a statement that an estimated 1,000 amputations had taken place due to injuries. In response to the quake the organization dispatched 30 rehabilitation and health staff to Haiti and announced that they would eventually increase staff numbers to 100 and provide hundreds of prostheses. In addition, the government of the United States issued orders for deployment to the U.S. Army's 1st Battalion, 73rd Infantry from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, which is scheduled to deploy along with the aircraft carrier . The U.S. Navy also announced on 13 January 2010 that the hospital ship Comfort and amphibious helicopter carrier will be deployed to assist in the humanitarian relief efforts. The American government also announced that it would provide $100 million for the aid effort in Haiti. Partners in Health, the largest health care provider in rural Haiti, also provided aid from Port-au-Prince. Despite the domestic and international relief efforts, many Haitians in the initial days after the earthquake did not have access to health care. Those injured in the quake, including both Haitians and foreign, have been treated in hospitals abroad. Many patients were transferred to hospitals in neighboring Dominican Republic, including to hospitals in the capital Santo Domingo and in the border towns of Neiba and Jiman√≠. The total number of casualties treated in the Dominican Republic reached into the hundreds and on 20 January the Dominican Republican government announced that 600 patients would be repatriated to Haiti. Some casualties were brought to the United States, including nearly 500 patients who were transported to Florida and treated in hospitals across the state, including University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital. Burial of the dead was one of the most serious concerns in the aftermath of the earthquake as the main cemetery in Port-au-Prince announced that its plots were full and it was not accepting any more bodies. The Haitian law that bodies must be prepared by a funeral parlor before burial was suspended within the first day of the earthquake. The government then turned to burying the dead in mass graves, including a number of plots in the fields around Titanyen, located north of the capital. Members of the International Committee of the Red Cross encouraged Haitian authorities to take measures so that the bodies could later be identified, including filling out standard forms on bodies; photographing clothing, jewelry, and special marks on the body; and noting where the body was found and where it was buried. Religious leader, including both Roman Catholic and Vodou priests, also objected to the mass burials. Max Beauvoir, the head of Haiti's main Voodoo priests' organization called the mass burials \\"degrading\\", \\"indecent\\" and \\"inhuman\\", due to the fact that in Voodoo the regular maintenance of the tomb and visitation of gravesites by descendants is highly important. There were also confirmed reports of uncollected bodies being burned in the streets.Haiti's voodoo priests object to mass burials, Reuters, 17 January 2010 Individuals The vast majority of those injured and killed in the earthquake were Haitian. Haitian casualties came from all sectors of society, from common citizens to prominent leaders and entertainers. Victims include public figures such as Port-au-Prince Archbishop Joseph Serge Miot and the vicar general, Msgr. Charles Benoit, who were killed in the destruction of the Port-au-Prince Cathedral. A number of individuals with connections to the government were killed: Hubert Deronceray, a former Minister of Education and Minister of Social Services and a three-time candidate for President, and opposition leader Micha Gaillard. An early report also listed Justice Minister Paul Denis as one of the victims but Denis was in fact able to escape the ministry's collapsing building in time. Among the academics killed were topographer Gina Porcena and creolist Pierre Vernet. Prominent Women's movement activists were killed, including Magalie Marcelin, who founded the organization Kay Fanm to help shelter victims of rape and violence; Myriam Merlet, who was currently working for Haiti's Ministry for Gender and the Rights of Women; Anne-Marie Coriolan, who founded the organization Solidarite Fanm Ayisyen (Solidarity with Haitian Women); and Myrna Narcisse, Director General of the Ministry of Women's Condition. The Haitian music industry experienced extensive losses in the quake. The dead included Joubert Charles, the most prominent promoter of music in Port-au-Prince; rapper Jimmy O. and rapper Evenson \\"Shacan Lord\\" Francis of the group Gasoline Clan. The music groups Djakout Mizik, Kreyol La, Nu Look, Krezy Mizik, Mika Ben, Mizik Mizik, and Carimi all reported missing members. A Haitian press association also reported that more than a dozen journalists had been killed. Among these were Wanel Fils, a reporter with Radio Galaxie; Henry Claude Pierre, a Jacmel-based correspondent for Radio Magic 9; and Belot Senatus, a cameraman for Radio Tele Guinen. Jean Robert Fran√ßois, a reporter with Radio Magic 9, was seriously wounded. The Caribbean Football Union reported that at least 30 people with ties to F√©d√©ration Ha√Øtienne de Football were killed, including players, coaches, referees, and administrative and medical representatives. Among those killed were Alix Avin, head coach of the senior men's team; Gerard Cineus former Haiti national football team coach; Antoine Craan, one of the first black professional soccer players in Canada and a longtime Quebec soccer official. and Jean Yves Labaze, who coach Haiti to the FIFA U-17 World Cup in 2007 and coached the national women's team. Some 20 others with ties to Haitian football were feared buried in the ruins. The families of numerous famous Haitians were casualties in the quake, including the family of WBC welterweight champion Andre Berto, who withdrew from a 30 January boxing match after learning of the death of relatives. Haitians look at a body pulled out from the rubbles of a school that collapsed after the earthquake that rocked Port-au-Prince on 12 January. Various Catholic religious institutes reported the deaths and injury of dozens of clergy members and the destruction and damage of churches, religious schools and offices. Among the more seriously affected was the Salesian religious institute, which stated that as many as 500 students and staff were killed in the collapse of the buildings and schools operated by the institute in Haiti. Those killed included Brother Hubert Sanon, the first Haitian Salesian, and 250 schoolchildren and some 200 young women studying in the schools. Protestant groups also reported casualties, the US-based Southern Baptist International Mission Board, which announced the death of Bienne Lamerique, pastor of the Siloam Baptist Church in Port-au-Prince. Foreign-based companies doing business in Haiti also suffered casualties. Trilogy International Partners, which provides mobile phone service in Haiti through its subsidiary Comcel Haiti and is one of the largest foreign investors in the country, announced that 5 of its 575 employees had died and 35 remained missing. U.S.-based Citigroup Inc. announced that the bank's headquarters in Haiti had been destroyed, killing and injuring some employees. And Oxfam reported that a business manager named Amedee Marescot was injured in the collapse of the Oxfam office and later died in hospital. Universities and religious institutions also reported the losses. The University of Virginia stated that graduate student Pierrette Stephanie Jean-Charles was killed while at home with her family. The First Church of Christ in Longmeadow, Massachusetts reported that at least thirty nursing students were killed in the destruction of the CONASPEH School, which the church had been assisting. The fates of some civilian Haitians received the attention of international media. Both The Washington Post and U.S.-based National Public Radio reported on the story of a nine-year-old girl named Haryssa, who died beneath the remains of her home before rescuers could reach her. As had CNN with the story of Anaika St. Louis, who was pulled from the rubble of her home in an hours long rescue effort, but died after her family was told at a hospital that they could not care for her. But many Haitian casualties went completely unrecorded. Agence France-Presse reported that in the initial days of the earthquake corpses remained unburied in the streets across the capital and the majority of bodies at the city morgue remained unidentified and unclaimed. At least two mass graves had been dug in Port-au- Prince for interment of the dead. Other bodies were often buried by family members in informal graves. The lack of a centralized system for tabulating casualties means that the exact number of dead and injured is unknown. The looting and violence that occurred in the wake of the quake also led to casualties, including fifteen-year-old Fabienne Cherisma, who was killed on Marthely Seiee Street in Port-au-Prince when police fired shots to disperse looters. Others identified as looters or thieves were killed by vigilantes. United Nations casualties Hotel Christopher, which served as the UN headquarters, after the earthquake The UN headquarters hosting the stabilization mission for Haiti (MINUSTAH), at the Christopher Hotel in Port- au-Prince, suffered a devastating collapse, concentrating early UN rescue efforts on their own personnel. Most of MINUSTAH's 9,000 troops and police were located elsewhere.

Containing nine nitrogen atoms, the molecule is considered highly complex. The precise atomic structure was pinned down in 2007, and two years later the molecule was synthesized in the lab of Phil Baran at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California.

As a soldier, he had a distinguished career in the Balkans and in the East against Sassanid Persia. In his later years, he plotted unsuccessfully against regent and later emperor Tiberius II (r. 574‚Äì582). Biography=Origins and early career Justinian was born in Constantinople sometime shortly after 525, the second son of Germanus, a cousin to the Emperor Justinian I (r. 527‚Äì565). He had an elder brother, Justin, and a sister, Justina, who married the general John.... Justinian was first appointed to military command in 550, when he, together with his brother Justin, were to accompany their father in his expedition against Ostrogoth Italy. Germanus, however, died suddenly in autumn 550, before the army had left the Balkans, where it was assembling... After this, Justinian and John (Germanus's son-in-law) were ordered to lead the army towards Salona (modern Split, Croatia), in preparation for a crossing over to Italy or an overland march to Venetia. John remained in charge of the army until the eunuch Narses, who was appointed as the expedition's new commander- in-chief in early 551, arrived at Salona to take up command.. In early 552, Justinian was placed at the head of an expedition against the Slavs who were raiding Illyricum, and shortly after, was sent to assist the Lombards against the Gepids. His brother Justin was also a member of this army. The two brothers, however, were detained by the need to suppress a revolt in the city of Ulpiana, and never arrived to aid the Lombards.. Career in the East Map of the Byzantine-Persian frontier. Nothing is known of Justinian during the next 20 years. By 572, however, he had risen to the rank of patricius and was placed as commander-in-chief of the forces in the northeastern sector of the Empire's frontier with Sassanid Persia (magister militum per Armeniam). From this post, he supported the outbreak of the Iberian and Armenian rebellion against the Sassanids, which led to the outbreak of a twenty-year- long conflict between Byzantium and Persia. In 572, he supported the Armenian forces under Vardan III Mamikonian in their defence of Dvin, and, when the fortress eventually fell, in its recapture later in the year. Soon, however, he was recalled to Constantinople because of friction with the Armenians... In late 574 or early 575, he was appointed as magister militum per Orientem and overall commander of the Byzantine forces in the East. In this role, he set about training the numerous fresh troops raised by the Empire, and effected a reconciliation with the Ghassanid ruler al-Mundhir, restoring thus the traditional Byzantine alliance with his people.. A three-year truce was soon after concluded for the Mesopotamian front, but it did not apply to Armenia.. In summer 575 or 576, Justinian failed to block the advance of the Persian army, headed by Shah Khosrau I (r. 531‚Äì579) himself, through Persarmenia. When the shah entered into Byzantine Cappadocia and advanced towards Caesarea, Justinian gathered a superior army and blocked the mountain passes leading to it. Khosrau withdrew, sacking Sebasteia in the process... Justinian pursued Khosrau, and twice he trapped him in a pincer movement: the first time, the Persian shah and his army only escaped after abandoning their camp and their belongings to the Byzantines, while the second, the Romans were defeated at a night attack against their encampments near Melitene due to dissension amongst the army's commanders. Then the Persians stormed Melitene and burned it down.. As the Persian army was preparing to cross the Euphrates, however, Justinian's forces caught up with them. The next day, the two armies drew up in battle formation near Melitene, but did not clash. Come nightfall, the Persians tried to cross the river in secret, but were detected and attacked by the Byzantines during the crossing. The Persians suffered heavy casualties, while the Byzantines captured great booty, including 24 war elephants which were sent to Constantinople.. In the following winter, Justinian advanced deep into Persian territory, through Media Atropatene, and wintered with his army on the southern shores of the Caspian Sea. Nevertheless, he was unable to regain control over Persarmenia.; . In 576/577, the Persian general Tamkhusro invaded Armenia, where he defeated the Byzantines under Justinian. Later, Tamkhusro and Adarmahan launched a major raid into the Byzantine province of Osroene. They threatened the town of Constantina, but withdrew when they received word of the approach of the Byzantine army under Justinian. Following these reversals, later in the same year, the Byzantine regent, Caesar Tiberius, appointed Maurice as Justinian's successor... Last years and court intrigues solidus of Emperor Tiberius II (r. 574‚Äì582). Despite his repeated plotting to overthrow him, the emperor pardoned Justinian. Returning to the capital, according to reports preserved exclusively in Western sources, Justinian was involved in a plot with the Empress Sophia over the succession of her husband, Justin II (r. 565‚Äì578), whose health was rapidly deteriorating. They intended to assassinate Justin's heir, the Caesar Tiberius (ruled as Tiberius II in 578‚Äì582), and have Justinian ascend the throne. Tiberius, however, discovered the plot, whereupon Justinian pleaded for forgiveness and offered 1,500 pounds of gold as a sign of contrition. Soon, however, between 579 and 581, Sophia and Justinian were plotting again. This conspiracy too was uncovered, but Justinian was again pardoned. Justinian had a daughter and a son, who is likely identifiable with Germanus, who was married to Tiberius's daughter Charito and raised to the rank of Caesar. Justinian died at Constantinople in 582.

Composition Their specialty is searching for victims under the debris of collapsed buildings and giving first aid. One of the group's original founders, Hector \\"El Chino\\" M√©ndez states that one of the things that distinguish his group from others is that they have the \\"balls to go in where no one else will\\" (huevos de entrar adonde los dem√°s no quieren). Today, the organization has an average of about forty members plus search and rescue dogs which they train themselves. The group, along with the Civil Protection Agency of Mexico, issues certificates and sponsors technical degrees in areas related to the field. When a volunteer enlists, he or she is trained in areas such as rescue strategies, managing collapsed structures and risk management. The main group is in Mexico City but there are branches in other parts of the country such as Poza Rica, Veracruz, Canc√∫n and Chihuahua. Recently, a foreign branch was started in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The group maintains ties with the International Rescue and Assistance League in France and the United Firemen without Frontiers in Spain. It also has associates in the United States, El Salvador, Bolivia, Peru, Germany and Indonesia. Within Mexico, the group coordinates with social organizations and government agencies such as the Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Interior. However, their longest association is with the government of Mexico City, whose professional ambulance corps along with the Mexican Red Cross assisted with the initial training of rescue dogs. History The organization began when a group of youths decided to help with rescue efforts in the aftermath of the 1985 Mexico City earthquake They mostly assisted by searching collapsed buildings for victims, risking their own lives in the process. None of the initial volunteers had any training, experience or equipment, but now the Topos are a professional team which have aided in rescue efforts in Mexico and various countries. The group was formally organized in February 1986, five months after the earthquake, in part because Mexico did not have any formal search and rescue training or services. Since 1985, the Topos have assisted rescue and recovery efforts in over twenty-two countries. On volunteers¬¥uniforms one can see written where s/he has been to help. One of the first was the 1986 San Salvador earthquake, only one year after the earthquake that was the impetus for the group's founding. Within Mexico, they have assisted after disasters in Manzanillo, Puebla and Oaxaca. They usually travel by commercial airliner, which limits equipment to thirty kilograms per person. Most of this equipment is simple, such as picks, drills and eyebolts. Outside of Mexico, they have been to Taiwan, New York City, and Iran. However, they state that the most difficult work they have done so far was in Indonesia, after the 2004 tsunami. The brigade pays for most of its own expenses, which often has them arriving by whatever means is available. When they went to Indonesia, the heavily discounted plane tickets from Japan Airlines only took them as far as Singapore. Once there, the group did not have money for the ferry to Indonesia and had to leave much of its equipment behind. The workers themselves made it to Banda Aceh only because a Baptist minister overheard the group arguing over money and gave them the US$400 they needed to cross. They ate whatever they could, slept in tents distributed by the Chinese government and hitched rides to disaster sites on Indonesian police trucks. Most of the work done was to remove bodies from the mud and debris left behind by the tsunami. One of the most recent events for the Topos was to Abruzzo, Italy, after the earthquake there in April 2009. It was their first time in Europe. The group participated in efforts after the 2010 Haiti earthquake. The first group of six left on 14 January for the country from Canc√∫n. The initial group went to assess the situation with later groups, including the canine unit going later. The Topos rescued 15 people alive in the capital. To date, no volunteer has lost his or her life on duty.

Every building in Kingston was damaged by the earthquake and subsequent fires, which lasted for three hours before any efforts could be made to check them, culminated in the death of about 1,000 people, and caused approximately $30 million in material damage ($ million in ). Shortly after, a tsunami was reported on the north coast of Jamaica, with a maximum wave height of about 2 m (6‚Äì8 ft). Tectonic setting Jamaica lies within a complex zone of faulting that forms the boundary between the Gon√¢ve Microplate and the Caribbean Plate. To the east of the island the main fault is the Enriquillo‚ÄìPlantain Garden fault zone while to the west the main structure is the Walton fault zone, both major sinistral (left lateral) strike-slip faults. The transfer of plate boundary displacement between these major fault zones takes place on a series of NW-SE trending faults, such as the Wagwater Belt. The overall tectonic setting is one of transpression at this restraining bend in the plate boundary. Damage The narrow harbour street of the burned district The greatest damage occurred at Kingston and at Buff Bay and Annotto Bay on the northern coast. Eighty-five percent of buildings in Kingston were destroyed by the shaking, which was followed by a fire that destroyed parts of the business and warehouse districts. The Elder-Dempster passenger steamer Port Kingston, which was under repair in Kingston Harbour at the time, was threatened by fire on the nearby wharf. A rapid temporary repair allowed her to be moved to the safety of an unaffected railway wharf. A suspension bridge was destroyed at Port Maria. Characteristics View of Kingston in 1907 showing damage caused by the earthquake. Earthquake The main shock lasted for about 35 seconds after some minor initial tremors and was accompanied by a roaring sound. The intensity of the shaking grew quickly to a first and strongest climax. The intensity then lessened before again reaching a second weaker climax. There were eighty aftershocks recorded up to 5 February, while the strongest of all was recorded on 23 February. The epicenter of the earthquake is not well constrained. The only seismograph in Jamaica at the time was put out of action by the earthquake. The rupture may have been on an eastward continuation of the South Coast Fault Zone, within the Wagwater Belt or in the Blue Mountains. The greatest felt intensity was noted for areas built on unconsolidated sands and gravels. To the east of Kingston, along the Palisadoes, there were sandblows and surface faulting associated with areas of subsidence and flooding. Tsunami Northward view of the street in the business section After the earthquake, tsunami were observed along much of the north coast of Jamaica at Hope Bay, Port Antonio, Orange Bay, Sheerness Bay, Saint Ann's Bay, Buff Bay, Port Maria and Annotto Bay; there were also some reports of waves along the south coast. Seiches were reported in Kingston Harbour. The level of the sea at Annotto Bay was reported to have initially dropped by more than , as the sea withdrew a distance of about , before returning at a height of about above normal, flooding the lower parts of the town. Aftermath The Port Kingston, the only passenger ship in Kingston Harbour, was used as a makeshift hospital, with improvised operating theatres in three parts of the ship and on the adjoining wharf. Kingston Public Hospital, despite loss of its water supply, continued to function throughout the following night. Three United States Navy warships, the battleships and and the destroyer , landed men and supplies on 17 January, although an offer of eight surgeons was rejected by Governor of Jamaica Alexander Swettenham.

Synopsis Professor Sharpey (Harold Goldblatt), working in a university research laboratory, is suspected of passing secrets to the Soviet Union, and commits suicide. British intelligence believe that this was due to shame over his betrayal of his country. His former colleague, Doctor Longman (Dirk Bogarde), believes that the sensory deprivation experiments that Sharpey was conducting on himself may have rendered him susceptible to brainwashing. He volunteers to undergo the same tests in order to prove his theory. The British Intelligence officer and a colleague decide to test the theory by trying to brainwash him against his much loved wife.

Written Answers. - National Monument. is a well-preserved 15th century Norman tower house with a round gate tower, situated in the parish of Burnchurch, County Kilkenny, Ireland. Burnchurch Castle and tower, along with the Church of Ireland church, and the lime trees became a National Monument in 1993.Appendix - Kilkenny County Council development plan. National monuments protected by the State under the Monuments Acts, 1930, 1954 (Amended 1987) It is said to have been built and owned by the Fitzgeralds of the house of Desmond in 15th century and continued to be occupied until 1817. It is south west of Kilkenny, off the Clonmel Road, 6 km from Ballybur near Cuffesgrange, outside the town of Callan, nearby to Kells Priory. It is located in Burnchurch parish and was in the barony of Shillelogher. Architecture Burnchurch Castle & TurretThe 12.5m high circular turret still remains. A walled courtyard was originally attached to the castle. It is six storeys high, and has an unusually large number of passages and chambers inside the walls. A great hall was formerly attached to the tower's outside wall, but this has now vanished, as has most a bawn with a 41 foot tall tower at one corner. Old drawings, date unknown, show remnants of buildings. Many tower houses have mural chambers and passages hidden away within their walls, though few have the number and complexity of those found in Burnchurch Castle. Beneath there is a vault with the principal chamber above, lying just below a gabled roof. There are numerous narrow rooms in the walls, including a \\"secret room\\" on the fourth floor. A curved outside staircase still provides access to the three upper floors of this little tower so it can be explored. It has mullioned windows and is noteworthy for its finely carved fireplace with a joggle voussoir arch and its tall round chimney. The rounded chimney may be a later improvement. It is broadly similar in size and layout to Clara Castle in Clara, but differs in that the gable-end walls are carried up one story higher than the other two walls and form to elongated turrets with their won rampart walls at the highest part of the building.() Burnchurch Castle and Clara are good examples of the characteristic Irish-style of stepped battlements. It is known for being one of several Irish towers with the slightly narrower sides of the castle extending up an additional floor, creating in essence a pair of tower wide turrets.

History  Designed in a restrained neoclassical style by Italian architect Guido D'Alessandro at the behest of Rafael Trujillo, construction started on February 27, 1944 ‚ÄîThe centenary of Dominican independence ‚Äîand was inaugurated on August 16, 1947. Occupying an area of 18,000 square metres and luxuriously appointed throughout, the National Palace is considered one of the most beautiful buildings built in the Dominican Republic.Editora Hoy. Nuestros Monumentos: Album Educativo en el A√±o del V Centenario del Descubrimiento y Envangelizaci√≥n de Am√©rica. Santo Domingo: Editora Hoy, [1992]. The building stands on the grounds of the former Presidential Mansion (Mansi√≥n Presidencial), built during the United States military occupation of 1916-1924.  Design  While the president's office is located within the palace, the Palacio Nacional is not an executive residence as the president does not live there; there is no designated Executive Residence in Santo Domingo. The building comprises three stories. Building services are located at ground level. The main floor includes the ceremonial vestibule, the Presidential and Vice-presidential offices, and the Cabinet meeting room. The third storey houses the main reception rooms: the Hall of the Ambassadors, the Hall of the Caryatids, the Green Room, the Mahogany room, and the president's private quarters. The dome, which rests on a windowed drum, is 34 metres high and has a diameter of 18 m. Inside, 18 columns sustain the dome. Most of the marble used throughout the building is Dominican, and was extracted from quarries in Saman√° and Caballero. The Palacio Nacional complex also includes the \\"presidential\\" Chapel of San Rafael Arc√°ngel, carried out in the same architectural style as the palace.  In popular culture  The Palace and mainly the Hall of the Caryatids was used for the new year's scene in The Godfather Part II where Michael confronts Fredo about his betrayal.

Jan C. Gabriel (1940 ‚Äì January 10, 2010) was a Chicago-area motorsport announcer who is best known for popularizing the motorsport phrase \\"Sunday! Sunday! Sunday!\\" Early life Gabriel was born in 1940 in Wisconsin and grew up in Palos Heights, Illinois. He graduated from Sandburg High School. Gabriel produced commercials for Community Discount stores and worked behind the microphone at WJOB in Hammond as a disc jockey. In the 1950s, Gabriel had billed himself as \\"Chicago's youngest teenage DJ\\" when he started at record hops. It wasn't until 1968 that he combined his love of announcing and racing into a stint at Santa Fe Speedway in Hinsdale, IL. While other announcers would usually just do a play- by-play at other racetracks, Gabriel would usually go wild with his announcing duties, usually being in the middle of track while announcing. \\"Sunday! Sunday! Sunday!\\" phrase In 1968, Ben Christ, the track owner of the U.S. 30 drag strip in Hobart, Indiana, wanted to advertise and make it known that his tracks were open on Sundays. He enlisted the help of Steve Cronen at Starbeat Recording Studios in Deerfield, Illinois. Originally, the idea for the tagline was to have two announcers trade intonations of \\"Sunday!\\" Not so. In 1967 The Sunday, Sunday, Sunday radio spot was recorded at WLTH radio in Gary, IN by Jerry Wilkerson and Peter Jerome at 10 AM on Thursday mornings. It usually took an hour to \\"get it together\\" because the copy was so long it ran more than 60 seconds to record, or the announcers screwed up, lost their breath or just missed a word. Because it was tape, the announcers had to record it again from the beginning. A courier from Chicago, who brought the copy with him, would run the taped spot back to Chicago for distribution to WLS and possibly WCFL for air Thursday afternoon through Sunday morning. \\"Where the great ones run,\\" was not yet used as a tag line in the spots in 1967. After dismissing nearly 50 announcers because they weren't vibrant enough, Gabriel's announcing was picked as the iconic tagline by Cronen. The spots ended with \\"Where the great ones run!\\", read and echoed by Gabriel. His deep voice and tagline was extensively used by Christ in many of his other racing venues advertisements, with Gabriel often recording fresh tracks up until the 1980s. The tagline was often imitated by other racetrack announcers and in popular culture till its decline in the 1980s as many small tracks and drag strips closed down or were absorbed by other organizations. Later life In 1980, suffering from polycystic kidney disease, Gabriel underwent a kidney transplant. Another transplant was needed and setup in 2004, but Gabriel was unable to find a suitable donor. His legs were amputated below the knee in 2005. Gabriel was the host and producer of the syndicated TV show The Super Chargers Show, which ran from 1982 to 1994. The show covered many aspects of Motorsport and car culture along with celebrity guests. Gabriel is credited in bringing both NASCAR and the National Hot Rod Association on television, as well as popularizing Monster Trucks. Still connected to motorsports, he helped to transfer Team Demolition Derby, a Santa Fe Speedway standby, to Route 66 Raceway in Joliet, IL. In 2003, Gabriel invited drivers from Canada, Australia and New Zealand to compete in the Team Demo Association World Championship. In the first Championship, the USA team won. Gabriel received The World of Wheels \\"Lifetime Achievement Award\\" in 2008. Death Gabriel died on Sunday, January 10, 2010, from polycystic kidney disease and complications from peripheral artery disease. Funeral services were held on Sunday, January 17 at his home in Lombard, Illinois. He is survived by his wife, Teresa (who is now the president of Team Demolition Derby), and a daughter, Amanda.

Biography Crilley was born in Trenton, New Jersey, on September 13, 1883. After enlisting in the U.S. Navy in March 1900, he became a gunner's mate and received additional training as a diver. On April 17, 1915, Crilley, by then a chief gunner's mate, participated in a dive to inspect the wreck of the submarine in preparation for a salvage operation. The F-4 had sunk weeks earlier in of water off the coast of Honolulu, Hawaii. Another diver, Chief Gunner's Mate William F. Loughman, became trapped underwater while returning to the surface after examining one of the F-4's hawsers. Loughman's lifeline and air hose became tangled in the hawser, preventing him from either ascending or descending. Crilley voluntarily dove down and untangled the lines, allowing Loughman to be pulled to safety. For these actions, he was awarded the Silver Lifesaving Medal in April 1916 and the Medal of Honor on November 19, 1928, thirteen years after the rescue. The latter award was formally presented to him on the White House grounds by President Calvin Coolidge on February 15, 1929. In 1917, Crilley was appointed to the warrant officer rank of Gunner(T), and in February 1918 became an ensign in the Naval Reserve. He commanded in 1919 and left active duty in July of that year. In the mid-1920s, he was involved with salvaging , and returned to active naval service in 1927-28 to work on the recovery of . He was awarded the Navy's second-highest decoration, the Navy Cross, for his actions as a diver during that operation. In 1931, Crilley served as second officer and master diver during the Arctic expedition of the civilian submarine Nautilus (previously known as ). Also in 1931, he assisted with the salvage of . Transferred to the retired list in May 1932, he was again employed on Navy work in 1939, during the salvage of . Crilley died at the Naval Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, on November 23, 1947.

The Cucuteni-Trypillia culture, which existed in the present-day southeastern European nations of Moldova, Romania, and Ukraine during the Neolithic Age and Copper Age, from approximately 5500 BC to 2750 BC, left behind thousands of settlement ruins containing a wealth of archaeological artifacts attesting to their cultural and technological characteristics. Refer to the main article for a general description of this culture; this article deals with its religious and ritualistic aspects. Some Cucuteni-Trypillia communities have been found that contain a special building located in the center of the settlement, which archaeologists have identified as sacred sanctuaries. Artifacts have been found inside these sanctuaries, some of them having been intentionally buried in the ground within the structure, that are clearly of a religious nature, and have provided insights into some of the beliefs, and perhaps some of the rituals and structure, of the members of this society. Additionally, artifacts of an apparent religious nature have also been found within many domestic Cucuteni-Trypillia homes. Many of these artifacts are clay figurines or statues. Archaeologists have identified many of these as fetishes or totems, which are believed to be imbued with powers that can help and protect the people who look after them. These Cucuteni-Trypillia figurines have become known popularly as Goddesses, however, this is actually a misnomer from a scientific point of view. There have been so many of these so-called clay Goddesses discovered in Cucuteni-Trypillia sites that many museums in eastern Europe have a sizeable collection of them, and as a result, they have come to represent one of the more readily-identifiable visual markers of this culture to many people. Archaeological artifacts As mentioned above, beginning in the Precucuteni III period (circa 4800-4600 BC), special communal sanctuary buildings began to appear in Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements. They continued to exist during the Cucuteni A and Cucuteni A/B (corresponding to Trypillia B) periods (circa 4600-3800 BC), but then for some reason these sanctuaries began to disappear, until in the Cucuteni B (Trypillia C) period (circa 3800-3500 BC) only a few examples have been discovered from archaeological exploration. These sanctuaries were constructed in a monumental style architecture, and included stelae, statues, shrines, and numerous other ceremonial and religious artifacts, sometimes packed in straw inside pottery. File:CucuteniOmegaandbull.JPGMasculine cross design File:CucuteniHourGlassDeity.JPGHourglass design File:CucuteniOmega.jpgMasculine bull horn design File:ReprezentareAntropomorficaCucuteni.JPGAnthropomorphic figure File:MuzeuldeistorienaturalavienaCucuteni4.JPGMiniature pottery Some of these artifacts originally seemed to represent themes that are Chthonic (of the Underworld), and Celestial/Heavenly, or of the sky. During an excavation in 1973 at the Cucuteni-Trypillia site at GhelƒÉie»ôti, near the city of Neam»õ, Romania, archaeologist »òtefan Cuco»ô discovered a house in the center of the settlement that was the community sanctuary. The following account written by Croatian archeologist Marina Hoti describes the findings within this sanctuary: > In the southeast corner of the house a vase surrounded by six vases was > found under the floor. The central vase was turned upside down, covering > another vessel with a lid, in which four anthropomorphic figurines were > found, arranged in a cross and looking to the four sides of the world. Two > figurines were decorated with lines and had completely black heads and legs; > the other two were not coloured, but they had traces of ocher red. Refer to the two accompanying images for a visual depiction of the four figurines within the upturned pot buried in the sanctuary at the GhelƒÉie»ôti site. Subsequent analysis of this discovery has led to a number of interpretations by various scholars over the years. »òtefan Cuco»ô, who discovered the artifact, included other symbols discovered at GhelƒÉie»ôti, including snake-like depictions, the cross-shape of altars, and swastika designs, concluded that it was associated with a ritual of fertility dedicated to the Goddess, associating the black-painted figurines with chthonic themes, and the red ocher-painted figurines with celestial or heavenly themes. Hungarian archaeologist J√°nos Makkay also supported a fertility ritual interpretation. Marija Gimbutas, Lithuanian archaeologist and author of \\"The Civilization of the Goddess\\", interpreted this discovery as a dualistic interpretation of summer and winter, representing the cycle of life and death in nature. However, later analysis of this discovery incorporated the entire setting in which these painted figurines were found: specifically, that they were buried under an upturned ceramic vessel. Comparing this find with other similar discoveries from contemporary cultures in Isaiia and Poduri, scholars developed a theory that the tableau taken in its setting, being buried beneath the floor of the sanctuary, and with the four figurines facing outward to the four cardinal directions, represented a means to protect the sanctuary and settlement from evil. The black heads of the figurines were associated with death, and the red ocher was painted on the figurines on the precise body parts that the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture painted on the body parts of their dead before burial. These figurines, therefore, most likely represented departed souls, or beings from the underworld (land of the dead). By enclosing them in an overturned vessel, and burying this entire arrangement under the floor of the sanctuary, they were protecting the settlement from the evil influences these figurines represented by creating a magical sigil of protection. Mother Goddess figurines As evidence from archaeology, thousands of artifacts from Neolithic Europe have been discovered, mostly in the form of female figurines. As a result a goddess theory has occurred. The leading historian was Marija Gimbutas, still this interpretation is a subject of great controversy in archaeology due to her many inferences about the symbols on artifacts. Some researchers consider that the symbols used for representing the feminity are the rhombus for fertility and the triangle as a symbol for fecundity. The cross, symbolizing nature's power of fertility and renewal, was sometimes used to represent masculinity, as well as the phases of the moon. \\"Circle of Goddesses\\" figurines Goddess with the double triangle (hourglass) design and \\"bird hands\\". This ritual assemblies lay in a vase that had a very anomalous shape to the Precucuteni style and were full of soil and straw. The cultic objects were put on display and worshiped during magic- religious ceremonies. The repeated use of them is proven by the presence of some chipping from wear. When not in motion, they were probably stored in this special container. The presence of soil under some statuettes kept in the vase, and the evidence of cariossids on the surface of two figurines and four stools, led some researchers to hypothesize that the pieces had been deposited in soil and straw for magical purposes: they had been left to bud. all the statues were distinct. Some of them bear geometrical decorations. There were observed mature statuettes (that have already given birth), young statuettes (that have not yet given birth), and a babies . Only the mature figurines may sit by right on clay stools. Bird goddess figurines Bird Goddesses According to some researchers as Gimbutas, Lazarocici, for the Precucuteni communities, mythic birds possibly embodied a solar principle and the revival of the life, serving as a symbol of prosperity and protection. Funerary rites One of the unanswered questions regarding the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture is the small number of artifacts associated with funerary rites. Although very large settlements have been explored by archaeologists, the evidence for mortuary activity is almost invisible. Making a distinction between the eastern Tripolye and the western Cucuteni regions of the Cucuteni- Trypillia geographical area, American archaeologist Douglass W. Bailey writes: > There are no Cucuteni cemeteries and the Tripolye ones that have been > discovered are very late. The discovery of skulls is more frequent than other parts of the body, however because there has not yet been a comprehensive statistical survey done of all of the skeletal remains discovered at Cucuteni-Trypillia sites, precise post excavation analysis of these discoveries cannot be accurately determined at this time. Some historians have contrasted the funerary practices of the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture with the neighboring Linear Pottery culture, which existed from 5500-4500 BC in the region of present-day Hungary and extending westward into central Europe, making it coincide with the Precucuteni to Cucuteni A Phases. Archaeological evidence from the Linear Pottery sites have shown that they practiced cremation, as well as inhumation (or burial). However, there appears to have been a distinction made in the Linear-Pottery culture on where the bodies were interred, based on gender and social dominance. Women and children were found to be buried beneath the floor of the house, while men were missing, indicating some other practice was associated with how they dealt with the dead bodies of males. One of the conclusions drawn from this evidence was espoused by Marija Gimbutas, author of The Civilization of the Goddess: The world of Old Europe, in which she theorizes that women and children were associated with hearth and home, and so they would be buried beneath it as an act of connecting their bodies to the home. Collectively taking these characteristics of the neighboring Linear Pottery culture into consideration, scholars have theorized that additional Cucuteni- Tryilian sites may be found, including locations that may be detached from the main settlements, where there may be evidence of the practice of cremation. Archaeologists have discussed broadening the search areas around known Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements to cover a much wider area, and to employ modern techniques to help try to find evidence of outlying sites where evidence of funerary activities could be found. ‚Äì This is a summary written by the author of a monograph with the same title, and posted to his online blog Eneoliticul est-carpatic (Eneolithic Eastern Carpathian) In addition to cremation and burial, other possible methods of disposing of the bodies of the dead have been suggested. Romanian archaeologists Silvia Marinescu-B√Ælcu and Alexandra Bolomey suggest a common practice of abandoning the body to the mercy of Mother Nature, a practice that may be somewhat similar to the Zoroastrian tradition of placing the bodies of the dead on top of a Tower of Silence (or Dakhma), which are then fed upon by carrion birds. Russian archaeologist Tamara Grigorevna Movsha proposed a theory, in 1960, to explain the absence of some bones, as considered to have magical powers and were scattered on purpose across the settlement. Others have suggested the practices of cannibalism (known also as anthrophagy), or excarnation, which is the practice of removing the flesh and organs of the dead, leaving only the bones. Romanian archaeologist Sergiu Haimovici writes about such a discovery: > ...Alexandra Bolomey...made a review of a series of...human remains, (and) > found...at least partly, (that) they have a cultic character and maybe > even...an antropophagy of (a) cultic type. This would indicate that perhaps some ritualistic cannibalism was practiced among the Cucuteni-Trypillia tribes. The only conclusion which can be drawn from archeological evidence is that in the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture, in the vast majority of cases, the bodies were not formally deposited within the settlement area. Still in one of few sites, where researchers have found a significant number of human remains (Poduri Dealul Ghindaru in Romania), it seems possible in analyzing the findings, that in the early Cucuteni Culture, the children and infants were inhumed near the houses or even under the house floor. Cremation Various researchers have some hypotheses about Cucuteni rituals: # Incineration Ritual of Cucuteni-Trypillya houses, most probable associated with interment and immolation. # a ritual, who consider sacrifice buried under houses or on settlement, animals, their heads or parts, possibly associated with immolation ceremony.Piatra Neamt permanent exposition # a ritual, who consist in burying (by interment) under dwellings or on settlement of human skulls, bone, sometimes burnt, the deceased with stock, possibly is also associated with immolation. # Rituals, associated with use of fire, when into pit, exclusive of ashes get the various things, possibly immolation oddments. Also some researchers argue, that in some rituals Cucuteni culture has use anthropomorphous, zoomorphous clay figurines, binocular vessels.

After Nate Berkenstock, Carl is thought to be the second-ever future pro baseball player to be born; he is also the \\"oldest\\" player with a certified birth date, as Berkenstock's is given simply as 1831, without a date attached. (Berkenstock's tombstone, however, gives his birth date as September 17, 1832; if accurate, this would make Carl first.) He played in one game for the 1874 Baltimore Canaries of the National Association. Exactly when Carl took up the game of baseball is unknown; his name is not listed in Marshall D. Wright's compendium of the game's pre-professional era, The National Association of Base Ball Players, 1857-1870. It seems unlikely that Carl wouldn't appear in his first match until the age of 42, when he stepped in as catcher for the Baltimore Canaries on September 9, 1874; he may have been one of the many who previously played under a pseudonym. (Carl went 0-for-3 that day, and the Canaries lost to the New York Mutuals, 15-1, en route to 9-38 season, after which they folded.) Carl's playing career wasn't over, however. Three years later, in 1877, he appeared in eight games for the Manchester, New Hampshire club of the International Association, a quasi-major league that featured many players that would later play in the real big leagues, including John O'Rourke, brother of \\"Orator\\" Jim O'Rourke. Carl, at the age of 45, managed three hits in 27 at bats for a .111 average. Lew Carl died on May 19, 1885 in Newark, New Jersey, at the age of 53.

While Duke William was transporting Acadians from √éle Saint-Jean (Prince Edward Island) to France, the ship sank in the North Atlantic on December 13, 1758, with the loss of over 360 lives. The sinking was one of the greatest marine disasters in Canadian history.  Captain  Captain William Nichols of Norfolk, England, was the commander and co-owner of Duke William when it sank. Nichols survived the sinking and received international attention when his journal recounting the tragic incident was published in popular print throughout the 19th century in England and America.The publications included John Frost, The Book of Good Examples Drawn from History and Biography, New York: 1846, p. 65; The Saturday Magazine (1821), p. 502; Reuben Percy and Sholto Percy, Percy's Anecdotes, New York (1826), p. 44.; and George Winslow Barrington, Remarkable Voyages and Shipwrecks. London: Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent and Co. (c. 1880). Several years after the sinking of Duke William, Nichols also received international attention when he was taken captive by American patriots during the American Revolution.Letter to George Washington from Henry Lee Jr. dated November 8, 1777, \\"The Papers of George Washington: Revolutionary War\\", 12 pp. 168‚Äì169.  Passengers  Noel Doiron (1684 ‚Äì December 13, 1758) was one of over three hundred people aboard Duke William who were deported from √éle Saint-Jean (Prince Edward Island). William Nichols described Noel as the \\"head prisoner\\" and the \\"father of the whole Island\\", a reference to Noel's place of prominence among the Acadian residents of √éle Saint-Jean (Prince Edward Island).Journal of William Nichols, \\"The Naval Chronicle\\", 1807 For his \\"noble resignation\\" and self-sacrifice aboard Duke William, Noel was celebrated in popular print throughout the nineteenth century in England and America.See Frost, The Saturday Magazine and Percy. Noel Doiron also is the namesake of the village of Noel in Hants County, Nova Scotia. Jacques Girrard was a priest who also sailed on the fatal voyage. Girrard had been the parish priest for Noel Doiron and other Acadians who lived on √éle Saint-Jean (Prince Edward Island). He was one of the few who survived the sinking of Duke William.George Winslow Barrington, Remarkable Voyages and Shipwrecks. London: Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent and Co. (c. 1880)  Voyage  Louisbourg fell to the British on July 26, 1758 and within two weeks a deportation order was issued for the Acadians of √éle Saint-Jean (Prince Edward Island). The English authorities had given up on their earlier attempts to assimilate the Acadians into the thirteen colonies and now wanted them returned directly to France. On October 20, 1758, Duke William left √éle Saint-Jean for France with over 360 Acadians on board. The ship sailed in a convoy with nine other vessels, two of which were (with over 280 Acadians) and (with approximately 310 Acadians).While sources vary regarding the numbers of Acadians on board the ships, this article uses calculations provided by Stephen White of the Universit√© de Moncton. The ship sailed through the Canso Strait and moored off Canso, Nova Scotia, for almost a month because of foul weather. During the time in Canso, the Acadians helped the ship narrowly escape a raid by the Mi'kmaq. On November 25, Duke William sailed out of the bay of Canso. On the third day at sea there was a storm and Duke William became separated from the other two ships. Ruby ran aground in a storm on Pico Island in the Azores, which caused the death of 213 of the Acadians on board. Almost two weeks after the ships were separated, late in the day on December 10, Duke William re- encountered Violet. Violet was sinking; during the night Duke William sprung a leak and the Acadians assisted at the pumps. In the morning on December 11, after a brief squall, Violet sank with all the Acadians on board. The Acadians and crew on Duke William tried for three days to pump the water from her. Captain Nichols recorded: \\"We continued in this dismal situation three days; the ship, notwithstanding our endeavours, full of water, and expected to sink every minute.\\" Captain Nichols reports that he gave up and announced to the Acadians and crew: \\"I told them we must be content with our fate; and as we sure certain we had done our duty, we should submit to Providence, to the Almighty will, with pious resignation.\\" Despite this resignation, Captain Nichols dispatched both the long boat and cutter that were on board so that they might approach any passing vessels. On the morning of December 13, two English vessels were within sight of Duke William. Captain Nichols records: \\"I went and acquainted the priest [Girrard] and the old gentleman [Noel Doiron] with the good news. The old man took me in his aged arms, and cried for joy.\\" The ships did not stop. During the possible rescue, Duke William almost got separated from the long boat and the cutter. As the long boat and cutter returned, a Danish ship appeared in the distance. Again those aboard thought they were saved, but the Danish ship, like those before, sailed away from them.  Noel Doiron's decision  Ship's boats in the 18th century were designed for work, not lifesaving.Tony Horwitz, Blue Latitudes, Picador Publishing, New York (2002) p. 168 Intended to load cargo and supplies as well as shuttle people ashore, the three small boats aboard Duke William could hold only a handful of those aboard. Captain Nichols then recorded Noel Doiron's decision: > About half an hour after, the old gentleman [Noel Doiron] came to me, > crying; he took me in his arms, and said he came with the voice of the whole > people, to desire that I and my men would endeavour to save our lives, in > our boats; and as they could not carry them, they would on no consideration > be the means of drowning us. They were well convinced, by all our behaviour, > that we had done everything in our power for their preservation, but that > God Almighty had ordained them to be drowned, and they hoped that we should > be able to get safe ashore. I must acknowledge that such gratitude, for > having done only our duty, in endeavouring to save their lives as well as > our own, astonished me. I replied that there were no hopes of life, and, as > we had all embarked in the same unhappy voyage, we would all take the same > chance. I thought we ought to share the same fate. He said that should not > be; and if I did not acquaint my people with their offer, I should have > their lives to answer for. The two boats on board were lowered into the English channel carrying only the Captain, his crew, and the parish priest Girrard. Upon lowering the life boats, Noel Doiron sharply reprimanded a fellow Acadian Jean-Pierre LeBlanc for trying to board a lifeboat while abandoning his wife and children. As Priest Girrard got in the lifeboat he saluted Noel Doiron. After Captain Nichols could no longer see the ship, four Acadians got into a third boat and arrived safely in Falmouth, England. Duke William sank about from the coast of France shortly after 4:00 p.m. on December 13, 1758. Noel Doiron, his wife, Marie, five of their children with their spouses and over thirty grandchildren were lost ‚Äì 120 family members in total.  Acadian Remembrance Day  The Federation des Associations de Familles Acadiennnes of New Brunswick and the Soci√©t√© Saint-Thomas d'Aquin of Prince Edward Island has resolved that December 13 each year shall be commemorated as \\"Acadian Remembrance Day\\" to commemorate the sinking of Duke William and the nearly 2,000 Acadians deported from Ile-Saint-Jean who perished in the North Atlantic from hunger, disease and drowning.Pioneer Journal, Summerside, Prince Edward Island, 9 December 2009. The event has been commemorated annually since 2004 and participants mark the event by wearing a black star.

Most expressed positive hopes and expectations for the president-elect, but some tried to prepare their readers for disappointment. Editorials varied from elation to cautious optimism, and a few were outright skeptical. Many celebrated Barack Obama's win as historic and a sign of changing race-relations in the United States. Many commentators said the election results surprised them because there was an international perception that America was too racist to elect a black president. Many also said people in their country were blinded by infatuation with Obama and encouraged them to see him as a normal human being capable of error. Within a week, the excitement and elation subsided somewhat and many newspaper editorials began to caution that Obama had enormous obstacles ahead.

Following the arrival of the Australians on New Britain in late 1944, replacing the US garrison on the island, they began a limited offensive against the Japanese forces on the island. Pushing east from the positions previously captured by the US troops earlier in the year, after landing at Jacquinot Bay on the southern coast in November, the Australians began advancing across the island towards the Gazelle Peninsula, where they sought to isolate the numerically superior Japanese garrison. This advance was effected along two axes: Cape Hoskins to Open Bay on the northern coast, and Jacquinot Bay to Wide Bay on the southern. Once the Australians had secured a line across the island between Wide Bay and Open Bay in March and April 1945, the fighting on New Britain died down as the Australians sought to contain the larger Japanese garrison while limiting their own casualties. This situation lasted until the end of the war in August 1945. Background alt=A colour map depicting several areas in the Pacific including New Guinea, New Britain and New Ireland and smaller islands The Japanese had captured the island of New Britain in February 1942 after overwhelming the small Australian garrison stationed around Rabaul.Wigmore (1957), pp. 392‚Äì441. The Japanese subsequently built up a large garrison on the island, consisting of around 93,000 men from General Hitoshi Imamura's Eighth Area Army. This became a lynchpin in the defensive barrier that they established following the failure of attempts to capture Port Moresby in late 1942. In December 1943, as part of Operation Cartwheel, US forces landed around Cape Gloucester and Arawe to capture vital airfields and to provide the Allies with access through the sea passage between the straits separating New Britain from New Guinea, where during late 1943 the Allies had fought to secure the Huon Peninsula. This formed part of the overarching Allied strategy of isolating the major Japanese base at Rabaul, as it had been decided that rather than destroying the base with a costly direct assault, a more prudent strategy would be to surround the base and therefore nullify it as a threat.Miller (1959), p. 272. Following actions by the 112th Regimental Combat Team and the 1st Marine Division around Arawe and Cape Gloucester, US forces had advanced east cautiously, and by August 1944 had secured Talasea and Cape Hoskins on the northern coast.Keogh (1965), p. 408. After this the US 40th Infantry Division had taken over and fighting on New Britain devolved largely into what Gavin Long, the Australian official historian, called a \\"tacit truce\\" with the US forces concentrating on defending their airfields on the west of the island ‚Äì with the 40th Infantry Division concentrated largely around Cape Gloucester ‚Äì and the Japanese on the eastern side being separated by a \\"no man's land\\", in which Australian-led indigenous troops from the Allied Intelligence Bureau (AIB) conducted a small scale guerilla campaign.Dennis et al (2008), p. 390. This included actions around Wide Bay throughout June to September.Long (1963), pp. 241‚Äì245. In November 1944, responsibility for Allied operations on New Britain passed from the US Army to the Australian Army. That month, the Australian 5th Division, under Major General Alan Ramsay, began arriving to replace the US 40th Infantry Division, which was needed for the fighting in the Philippines. Having greatly underestimated the strength of the Japanese garrison on the island, the Australians began a limited offensive, with the goal of advancing east from Cape Hoskins towards the Japanese stronghold around Rabaul. In November, the Australian 6th Infantry Brigade, under Brigadier Raymond Sandover began arriving. The first ground operation saw the 14th/32nd Infantry Battalion carry out a landing at Jacquinot Bay, on the southern coast of New Britain, coming ashore unopposed, while other elements ‚Äì the 36th Infantry BattalionLong (1963), p. 249. ‚Äì took over around Cape Hoskins, further west.Rickard 2015. Shortly afterwards, the 6th Infantry Brigade began moving east towards Cutarp, as the 13th Infantry Brigade under Brigadier Eric McKenzie arrived to take over responsibility for the defence of the Australian base around Jacquinot Bay, along with advanced elements of the 4th Infantry Brigade under Brigadier Cedric Edgar. At the same time, aircraft from the Royal Australian Air Force and Royal New Zealand Air Force began bombing Japanese positions around Rabaul; the Japanese, with only a few serviceable aircraft, made no attempt to stop the attacks. Battle A map of Australian operations in central New Britain between October 1944 and March 1945. In the first two months following the Australian take over, the Japanese sought to generate some momentum in their operations west of the Gazelle Peninsula, but a number of actions against Australian patrols forced them to withdraw east towards the peninsula. In mid-January 1945, the Australians exploited this withdrawal on the northern coast of New Britain, and the 36th Infantry Battalion advanced overland to Ea Ea, around the western edge of Open Bay, while a small element remained at Cape Hoskins to defend the airfield there. Between January and April 1945 a series of clashes followed and as Australian patrols came to dominate the coast around the bay, the Japanese fell back towards the Turiu River, to the north of the bay, where the swampy ground offered a series of natural obstacles. After advancing to Watu, in line with the western expanse of the bay, the Australians temporarily halted their advance. Along the southern coast, Royal Australian Navy Fairmile motor launches began patrolling towards Wide Bay shortly before the new year as Japanese submarines had been spotted elsewhere, particularly on the north coast around Open Bay. In late December, two companies from the 14th/32nd Infantry Battalion, reinforced by a platoon from the 1st New Guinea Infantry Battalion, were sent east from Cutarp to Sampun, on the southern expanse of Wide Bay in late December, moving by barge.Department of Veterans' Affairs. These forces were bolstered in early January with the arrival of the remaining two companies of the 14th/32nd, along with a troop of artillery from the 2/14th Field Regiment.Long (1963), pp. 252‚Äì253. Between late January and early February 1945, the Australian 6th Infantry Brigade advanced eastwards along the southern coast of New Britain towards Milim, where they established a patrol base with the intention of fanning out towards Henry Reid Bay. Boomerang fighters and Beaufort fighter-bombers attacked Japanese positions to the north of Karlai Plantation on 15 February, and the 14th/32nd subsequently took the position unopposed after the Japanese defenders withdrew under heavy artillery fire. Two days later, the 14th/32nd took the trading station at Kamandram. 16th Infantry Battalion landing at Karlai Plantation, March 1945 alt=Infantrymen coming ashore from landing craft In late February, the 19th Infantry Battalion was moved to Gogbulu Creek, where it relieved the 14th/32nd. Elements of the 2/14th Field Regiment established themselves at Karlai Plantation from where they fired support missions across the bay towards Waitavalo. Meanwhile, the 19th Infantry Battalion crossed the Mevelo River and sent patrols eastwards toward the Wulwut River, which flowed into Henry Reid Bay.Long (1963), p. 256. From Henry Reid Bay, the Australians exploited towards the Kamandram Mission, on the edge of Wide Bay, where the Japanese had earlier established a new defensive line. In mid-February, the two forces clashed for the first time in the area, but the Japanese were unable to check the Australian advance. In early March, the Australian high command ordered an advance towards the coconut plantations at Waitavolo and Tol on the northern edge of Henry Reid Bay. At Tol, the Australians found evidence of a large scale massacre of Australian troops, who had been murdered by troops from the III Battalion, 144th Infantry Regiment in 1942 when the Japanese had captured the island from the Australians. They subsequently exhumed 158 bodies.Bradley (2012), p. 21. Following a crossing of the Wulwut River with engineer support, the 14th/32nd Infantry Battalion took over from the 19th again and from 5 March heavy fighting followed over the course of six weeks as the Australians reduced the fortified Japanese positions on Mount Sugi along a series of ridges west of the river and overlooking the bay. These hills were named \\"Lone Tree\\", \\"Bacon\\", \\"Cake\\", \\"Young\\", \\"Perry's\\", \\"Kath's\\" and \\"Moose\\",Long (1963), p. 257. and were defended by a series of pillboxes, supported by mortars and machine guns. The most significant action was fought around Bacon Hill, which was captured on 18 March by the 14th/32nd Infantry Battalion. The fighting during this period was made more difficult by heavy rains which made the going tough for the infantrymen climbing the steep slopes,Grant (2016), p. 226. while the jeep tracks below upon which the Australians relied for supplies became seas of mud, and the bridge across the Mevelo River was washed away. Japanese planes appeared for the first, and only time, in the campaign in mid-March, with two aircraft dropping several bombs on the bridge over the Wulwut, causing a number of casualties.Long (1963), p. 260. After Waitavolo was secured, the 36th Infantry Battalion pushed inland and exploited further along the coast, investing Jammer Bay.Keogh (1965), p. 412. The 13th Infantry Brigade, elements of which had landed at Karlai Plantation in late March, subsequently took over from the 6th Brigade, and began patrolling operations on the southern coast; while elements of the 4th Infantry Brigade marched north in May.Long (1963), pp. 260‚Äì261. Aftermath 37th/52nd Infantry Battalion coming ashore at Open Bay, May 1945 alt=Infantrymen coming ashore from landing craft Following the fighting around Wide Bay and Open Bay, the Australian advance essentially came to an end, although limited offensive action continued up until the end of the war. They had effectively secured the island to the west of the Gazelle Peninsula, isolating the 93,000-strong garrison around Rabaul.Long (1963), p. 241. For the remainder of the war, patrol actions were used to maintain the initiative and hold the defensive line that was established across the island between the two lodgements at Open Bay and Wide Bay; in May, due to shipping shortages, the 37th/52nd Infantry Battalion marched across the island to the Mavelo Plantation from where they were ferried by barge to Open Bay to relieve the 36th Infantry. No further advances were attempted as the Allies focused their main operations elsewhere, such as Borneo and the Philippines. In addition, engineers worked to improve the road system around the secured plantations. Refugees from the Japanese controlled area moved into the Wide Bay and Open Bay areas and were subsequently recruited by the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit for labouring tasks. Australian operations on the island were constrained by shortages of shipping and air support as these resources were redirected largely to efforts to secure Borneo; these shortages delayed the concentration of the 5th Division considerably and it was not until April that the 5th Division had completed its movements, with the arrival of the 4th and 13th Infantry Brigades being followed by the 2/2nd Commando Squadron.Long (1963), p. 250. At the conclusion of hostilities, Australian planners discovered the error that they had made in estimating the size of the Japanese force. They also determined that the force was well provisioned and had ample equipment and ammunition with which to launch a strong counter-attack. Nevertheless, the Japanese commander had chosen not to launch a major counter- offensive, despite heavily outnumbering the Australians as he was under orders to preserve his strength until mutual action could be achieved with the Imperial Japanese Navy, an opportunity that did not eventuate.Tanaka (1980), p. 127. Battle casualties for the entire campaign for the Australians amounted to 53 killed and 140 wounded, with another 21 dying from other causes;Keogh 1965, pp. 410‚Äì412. Japanese casualties on the south coast up to April were reported by Australian sources as 138 killed, while 68 were killed on the northern coast in the same time. Five prisoners were also taken.Long (1963), p. 252. Considered a \\"classic containment campaign\\", the 5th Division had been able to successfully contain a much larger Japanese force.Maitland (1999), p. 112.

At the time, Sobral was creating leather handbags as well as sandals crafted from recycled tires and jewelry made with metal corroded in acid. From the very beginning, Sobral discovered his affinity for working with unusual recycled materials, an environmentally- responsible practice he continues to this day. Career For years, Sobral traveled between craft fairs and cultural events, and even knocked on restaurant doors, to find buyers for his hand-crafted goods. But distribution was difficult, as there were many other artists creating similar products and selling in the same markets. However, in 1976, Sobral stumbled across a new material ‚Äì resin ‚Äì that would prove to be a turning point in his career. At a craft fair in Cabo Frio, Sobral first saw jewelry made by Argentinean artisans from polyester resin. Immediately seeing the possibilities associated with this unique material, Sobral asked the artists for information about the raw material, but not surprisingly, they demurred. However, Sobral was entranced and when he finally discovered a source of resin through his own detective work, he was determined to work with this new material, and he built a workshop on a small farm located in Jardim Alvorada, Nova Igua√ßu, a suburb of Rio de Janeiro. Here, he launched his new company, Genesis, which over time would evolve into the now world-famous company, Sobral. He lives and works here still, with his wife Elisa, and their many adopted stray dogs. The advent of the 1980s left the Hippie movement behind, the fashion world became more sophisticated, and Genesis evolved into Memphis, a better-equipped workshop that shared space with the local samba school. In 1982, inexperienced and without a word of French in his vocabulary, Sobral traveled to Paris prepared to take the fashion world by storm. Arriving in the midst of Bastille Day celebrations in Paris, Sobral opened his portable display case and faced the difficult challenge selling anything during the summer months when Parisians head to the country for holidays. Learning from this experience, the following year Sobral chose the right moment to return to Paris, and his designs quickly became as popular in Europe they were in Brazil, and by 1988, Sobral was running a million dollar company. Sobral continued to grow in size and popularity through the 1980s and 1990s, earning recognition and respect throughout the jewelry and fashion industries worldwide. In 1991, Sobral opened a store in the sophisticated Rio neighborhood of IpaNnema, the first of many Sobral boutiques, and his continued success in Paris is emphasized by the many awards he has won. In recognition of his fierce sense of design and attention to quality, Sobral has received the prestigious Etoile de Mode five times at the famed BIJORHCA designer jewelry show in Paris. Singled out among 600 exhibitors from around the world, Sobral was honored by the Designer Jury in September 2004, by the College Jury of the Paris Fashion School in January and September 2005, by the press Jury in January 2006, and by the Shop Jury in September 2006. In 2006, he also won the ultimate honor, the Best in Show award for his famed ‚ÄúPop Art‚Äù collection. Taken by Sobral‚Äôs success, in 2007, legendary designer Karl Lagerfeld commissioned Sobral to create accessories for the Maison Karl Lagerfeld Summer 2008 collection, and Sobral had the satisfaction of seeing pieces bearing his name and that of the iconic Lagerfeld shown on the Parisian runway. Current status Today, Sobral has stores in New York City, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Heidelberg, Honfleur, Buzios and Paraty ‚Äì a total of 17 Sobral boutiques throughout the America‚Äôs and Europe.

The complex covers 239 hectares and is located 22 kilometers southeast of Cusco near the town of Tip√≥n. It consists of wide agricultural terraces irrigated by a network of water channels fed by a natural spring. Several surrounding ruins have been excavated, and many more are visible below the soil. Description The Tip√≥n complex is located near Oropesa in the Community of Choquepeda, southeast of Cusco, and along the Cusco-Puno road. It contains enclosures, terraces, and an intact canal. The upper complex is crossed by the Inca Trail with an irrigation canal. It was put on the List of Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks. Speculation exists that the site may have been used as a laboratory for agricultural products because of the various micro-climates found within the complex. Tipon is considered one of the 16 most important archaeological tours for tourists who visit the area. Besides being an archaeological complex, the site is home to one of the largest irrigation works in the terraces, with a great distribution of outdoor water channels. History The purpose of Tip√≥n is not known. Even the original name of the Inca site is lost. The only possible written reference can be found in the Comentarios Reales de los Incas by Garcilaso de la Vega. According to de la Vega, after the Viracocha Inca succeeded his father, Yawar Waqaq, he ordered a palace to be built for his father. The location of this palace is described as close to Cusco, built between the straits of Muyna and Quepicancha, near the river Tucay. As Tip√≥n is located between two mountain streams, and above the Urubamba river, some archeologists believe de la Vega was describing Tip√≥n.

The company was founded by Emmanuel Cassimatis and his wife Julie Cassimatis as a private company initially with the name Cassimatis Securities Pty Ltd on 23 May 1994. As part of the company's expansion outside of Townsville the company changed its name from a personality based name to ozdaq Securities Pty Ltd on 10 April 2000. This name remained intact until 1 Feb 2004 when it was relinquished consequent to trademark objections from the NASDAQ stock exchange in the United States. The company then traded as Storm Financial Pty Ltd from 2 Feb 2004 until 14 Jun 2007 at which time the company became an unlisted public company and continued trading as Storm Financial Ltd from 15 Jun 2007 in preparation for making an initial public offering (IPO) in December 2007. This IPO was subject to a Storm Financial Prospectus which was dated 14 Nov 2007 and lodged with the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) on the same date. Storm Financial Ltd continued to trade until external administrator Worrells Solvency and Forensic Accountants were appointed on 9 Jan 2009. The main creditor Commonwealth Bank appointed receivers and manager KordaMentha on 15 Jan 2009. Business At the time of Storm Financial's proposed listing on 17 Dec 2007 Storm Financial had over 146 employees in 13 offices in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. Storm Financial was financial planning business which gave advice across the broad spectrum of financial products including advice on, but not limited to:- investments, unit trusts, superannuation, life insurance and associated traditional and margin loans. Storm had approximately 13,000 clients across Australia with $4.5 billion of funds and loans under advice (FLUA) as at June 2007. Of Storm's 13,000 clients, approximately 3,000 (23%) had some form of gearing associated with their portfolios and recommended by Storm. A cornerstone of Storm's business model was to acquire and aggregate other financial planning businesses into a single conglomerate whose practices, quality control and the manufacturing mechanics of the advice was consistent. In August 2008, Storm Financial's clients had A$4.8 billion invested in the Storm branded index funds that were managed by Colonial First State and Challenger and other non-Storm branded funds. By October 2008, that had dropped to A$3.5 billion, primarily as a result of falling share values. In August 2008, approximately 37 percent of investments were being funded by margin lending. In October 2008 it had 13 000 clients. Client fees In addition to gaining efficiencies by commoditising the packaging of its advice in Storm's back office, Storm Financial used its large flow of funds to obtain significant discounts in fees charged by financial product manufacturers such as Fund managers and Margin Lenders. This enabled Storm to pass on significant savings to its clients, effectively allowing its clients to be charged wholesale prices for retail advice and retails products. Storm offered two alternative fee options to its clients. The first fee option was a fee for service structure consisting of a relatively higher upfront fee and lower ongoing trail commission. The alternative option had a nil upfront fee component with higher ongoing trail commissions, similar to traditional financial advice models. Storm's Statement of Advice indicated that, on average, the cost of the two fee options to the client converged after a period of approximately four and a half years. Before this period the nil upfront fee option with the higher trail commission favoured the client, whilst after this period the client was better off under the fee for service option with the fee advantage increasing exponentially over time. The upfront and ongoing fees charged by Storm in both fee options were identified in general terms in Storm's Financial Services Guide (\\"FSG\\") as well as a more detailed breakdown with specific pricing in each individual client Statement of Advice. History of ASIC & Storm to Dec 2007 On 12 December 2008, after having discussions with the Commonwealth Bank, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) began investigations on Storm Financial's advice to its clients. From the early days of Storm Financial, ASIC played an integral role in monitoring and advising Storm on its activities. Storm was well known for its proactive approach to understanding and desiring to comply with Corporations Law. 1 October 1993 Storm queries the ASC re upcoming regulations Evidence emerged from as early as 1 October 1993 when Storm's (then Emmanuel Cassimatis & Assoc Pty Ltd ) CEO and managing director Emmanuel Cassimatis demonstrated a diligent approach in complying with the upcoming Australian Securities Commission's (as ASIC was known at the time) regulations when he wrote to the ASC to express concern and receive clarification about pending regulatory changes. The ASC replied to these concerns with advice and copies of ASC practice notes relating to sections of Corporations Law. 8 October 1993 the ASC queries Storm on advice On 8 October 1993 the ASC wrote to Storm requesting clarification about Storms advice strategy as espoused by Storms principal Emmanuel Cassimatis in a Townsville newspaper article. Storm responded to the ASC addressing the points raised which the ASC later acknowledged via a response letter and also advised that no further enquiries were necessary. 19 August 1994 Storm clarifies client fees with the ASC Further evidence of diligence on the part of Storm came on 19 August 1994 when one of the directors of Storm (then Cassimatis Securities) sought clarification from the ASC about the treatment of fees and investment funds from clients. It was established and confirmed that Storm could continue collecting fees in its own name. It was further established that as long as unit buying funds were not taken into Storms name then it could not be deemed that clients were investing in Storm. All Storm clients were therefore investing through Storm directly into various managed funds. Storm maintained this separation until it went into administration. 9 October 1995 routine ASC audit of Storm Following an inspection and review by officers of the ASC on 9 October 1995, the ASC raised numerous matters requiring an explanation, in a letter dated 3 November 1995. Storm responded in a letter dated 17 January 1996 with detailed annexures replying in full and answering all matters of concern to the ASC. The Australian Securities Commission responded by a letter dated 15 February 1996 relevantly:- a) Expressing no dissatisfaction with Storms response; b) With no suggestion that Storm could improve the quality of its risk disclosure to its clients. March 2005 routine ASIC audit of Storm In or about March 2005, ASIC conducted an audit on Storm. Again, ASIC raised no substantial objection to Storm's advice to its clients, or any other aspect of its business. November 2007 ASIC reviews Storm Education and Processes On 6 November 2007, Storm lodged with ASIC a prospectus for its offer of 160 million shares to the public. The prospectus contained a detailed description of the Storm Business Model, and of the practices and procedures for the production of financial advice to clients. By an email dated 12 November 2007, ASIC notified Storm that three of its senior officers, namely:- a) Deborah Koromilas, Assistant Director, Financial Services Compliance; b) Elizabeth Korpi, Lawyer, Capital Markets, Compliance; c) Belisa Jong, Manager, Capital Markets, Compliance, would visit Storm's Sydney office on 13 November 2007, and requested an explanation of Storm's advice model, including the client education process and documentation provided to clients and an explanation of how Storm's internal software system interacted with the services Storm provided to clients. In the course of the meeting, ASIC officers referred to Storms prospectus and asked various questions including an explanation of the advice that Storm gave to its index fund clients. In response Storm presented and communicated to the officers from ASIC:- i) the substance of Storm's advice model; ii) the substance of Storm's client education process; iii) an explanation of how the Storms internal software system interacted with the services Storm provided to clients; iv) responses to all other matters about which they enquired; and following the meeting on 13 November 2007, ASIC was satisfied that Storm's prospectus accurately set out the material elements of its business model. In addition, Ms Koromilas from ASIC, informed Storm that ASIC wished other advisors had procedures and processes that were as good as Storm's. Summary When the officers of ASC and ASIC conducted their reviews and audits they had complete access to all of the documents used by Storm in giving financial advice to clients, including practice and procedure manuals, advice templates, cash flow analyses, client financial profiles, Storm's Financial Services Guide and Statements of Advice. The ASC and ASIC often required individual client files to be ready in advance of their visits. The ASC and ASIC thereby became familiar with all aspects of Storm's business relevant to the advice it was giving clients and the processes & procedures within Storm for the production of financial advice to clients, including advice templates, cash flow analyses and client financial profiles. Neither the ASC nor ASIC informed Storm following any of their reviews or audits that the Storm model contravened or might contravene any of the financial services laws. All of the ASC's and ASIC's communications with Storm, following such reviews and audits, were to the effect that Storm's conduct was, in general, appropriate and lawful, subject only to minor matters. Collapse The Commonwealth Bank forced Storm into administration on 9 Jan 2009 when the bank called up its lending facilities to Storm citing a default on Storms own margin lending facility with the bank. Whilst the date of the alleged default by Storm was 10 October 2008, the Commonwealth Bank records at the time showed Storm to not be in default. The banks acceptance of non-default was evidenced by the banks approval to Storm for a $30m loan facility on 24 October 2008, the banks funding of a $10m facility to Storm on 29 October 2008 and a new loan facility of $4.725 m on 5 December 2008 for the purchase of a new building. Whilst in the past the Commonwealth Bank sent margin call notices out to Storm clients, the advisor or both, the banks failure to issue margin call notices at the critical time was one of the major influences in late 2008 that triggered the eventual collapse of Storm. The banks failure to issue margin call notices together with its inability to reconcile the correct financial position of each client ultimately led to many clients passing through their margin call trigger points and ending in negative equity. The unreliability and inaccuracy of the data provided to Storm and Storm clients by the Commonwealth Bank was identified in clause 24 of an evaluation conducted by the Honourable Roger Gyles AO QC on 18 November 2011. This evaluation further states that not only was the banks data inaccurate but that Commonwealth Bank officers knew of these inaccuracies. Separate analysis revealed the extent of the CBA data errors and how integral these errors were to the significant losses that Storm clients suffered. On 8 December 2008, the Commonwealth Bank sent a letter to all of its Storm clients who found themselves in negative equity (according to CBA data which was faulty) as a consequence of falling markets and the banks failure to issue clients with a margin call notice. The lack of information meant that clients were unable to transact on their portfolios with confidence consequently resulting in significant losses. The CBA letter to Storm clients further incorrectly states that Storm was the sole manager of the clients margin loan throughout the period. On 24 December 2008 the Federal Court of Australia found that Storm had proved, to the requisite standard of proof for interlocutory injunction, that the CBA had engaged in conduct that was, in contravention to the Corporations Act 2001, misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive. The Commonwealth Bank then issued a letter on 9 December 2008 to its Storm clients that were sold out of the market allegedly on the instructions of Storms CEO, Emmanuel Cassimatis. This letter repeated elements of CBA's 8 December 2008 letter as well as alleging that Storm provided instruction to the bank that the CBA / Storm portfolios of all margin lending clients with an LVR greater than 90% be fully redeemed. Material elements of CBA's letter of 9 December 2008 was also found to be deceptive and misleading by the Federal Court of Australia. On 17 December 2008, the Commonwealth Bank sent a generic letter to all its Storm clients further reinforcing the banks message of 8 and 9 December 2008 that Storm was the sole manager of the clients margin loan and further adding that Storm was \\"completely responsible for your [the clients] financial position‚Ä¶\\". Once again, the Federal Court of Australia found to the standard of proof for interlocutory injunction that the assertions by the Commonwealth Bank were deceptive and misleading. Unfavourable findings for the Commonwealth Bank were brought down on Wednesday 24 December 2008 by Justice Greenwood in the Federal Court in an interlocutory action brought about by Storm Financial. Furthermore, following these unfavourable findings, the Commonwealth Bank on the next available business day after the Christmas break being Monday 29 December 2008 issued notices of demand to Storm Financial calling up Storms entire commercial facilities. The ultimate consequence of the banks demands was to force Storm Financial into administration on 9 January 2009 'coincidentally' being the date that Justice Greenwood had set the matter down for mention for the purpose of setting a trial date with the Commonwealth Bank being the defendant. Storm being forced into administration by the Commonwealth Bank had the desirable outcome that the bank avoided trial. On 12 December 2008, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission began investigation of Storm Financial's margin lending and related advice. Storm Financial was placed in administration in January 2009. The company had A$88 million in debts at the time. The company was placed in liquidation by a Federal Court decision on 26 March 2009, putting asset recovery in the hands of liquidators Worrells Solvency and Forensic Accountants. Investors in Storm Financial were expected to face large losses, possibly getting none of their funds back. Many of Storm Financial's clients are expected to face economic hardship; a survey of one group of 400 clients indicated two-thirds would be unable to purchase a home after the forced sale of their existing house. The Commonwealth Bank held about 30 percent of the loan business when it collapsed. High-profile victims of the collapse include Australian cricketer Andrew Symonds, estimated to have lost approximately A$1.5 million in the company's failure. former professional rugby league footballer Wally Fullerton Smith, an advisor working with Storm, lost his home and business. Inquiry In 2009, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services conducted an inquiry into the collapse of Storm Financial and Opes Prime, as well as consideration of broader financial planning and governance issues. It released its report - Inquiry into Financial Products and Services in Australia - in November 2009. The report made 11 recommendations including increasing the powers of the regulator but did not recommend banning commissions. Storm Investors Consumer Action Group, which represents many of the victims of the company's collapse, blamed poor banking practices for the collapse and were disappointed that the inquiry did not bring bankers to task for their mismanagement. Government response In April 2010, the Minister for Financial Services, Chris Bowen, announced the Government's response to the inquiry. He set out a range of reforms including, notably, going further than the Inquiry recommendations by banning commissions for financial planners giving advice on retail investment products including superannuation, managed investments and margin loans. Other reforms included instituting a statutory fiduciary duty so that financial advisers must act in the best interests of their clients, and increasing the powers of the corporate regulator; the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.Chris Bowen (26 April 2010). Overhaul of Financial Advice. Media Releases #36. Retrieved on 3 July 2011.

The reforms are due to be fully implemented on 1 July 2012. Class action lawsuits In July 2010, Sydney-based lawyer Stewart Levitt of law firm Levitt Robinson Solicitors filed a class action lawsuit against the Commonwealth Bank of Australia alleging that, in its dealings with Storm Financial's investors, the bank's subsidiary Colonial First State was running an illegal unregistered Managed Investment Scheme and had engaged in misleading and deceptive trade conduct.http://www.theage.com.au/business/bank- accused-of-failing-its-clients-20100702-zu89.html This was followed by a series of other class actions on behalf of Storm Financial investors against several other Australian banks, including ANZ, Westpac, Bank of Western Australia, and most notably, Macquarie Bank ‚Äì which, in March 2013, settled the lawsuit brought by investors advised by Storm Financial and who had Macquarie margin loan facilities for $82.5 million.http://www.macquarie.com.au/mgl/au/about-macquarie- group/news/2013/20130315a See also *Economy of Queensland References Category:Defunct financial services companies of Australia Category:Companies based in Queensland Category:Financial services companies established in 1994 Category:Financial services companies disestablished in 2009 Category:Australian companies disestablished in 2009 Category:Australian companies established in 1994 ","title":"Storm Financial"},{"id":"25812182","text":"A total solar eclipse occurred on March 25, 1857.

Her bow was reinforced in 1984, and allows her to also serve as an icebreaker during the winter. The vessel served the New York City Fire Department for her first fifteen years before being sold to the District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department in 1977. When she was built, she was both faster than her older fleet-mates, and had a shallower draft, making her well-suited to be stationed in a region of the Hudson River with areas of shallow water. On 2012, Washington DC's Inspector General published a report that the John Glenns maintenance had been dangerously neglected. The report noted that, in addition to not implementing a program of general inspection, the city had neglected to plan or budget for a replacement for the fifty-year-old vessel. The report listed hundreds of other municipalities who had been able to replace or upgrade their fireboats through FEMA Port Security Grants, but that Washington DC had not applied for a grant. The report estimated that it would cost $7 million to replace the John Glenn with an equivalent, modern vessel. In October 2014 the Washington City Paper noted that, rather than respond to the report city government had merely left the vessel at her moorings. Similarly, budget problems had forced the fire department to take half its fleet of firetrucks out of service, because it could not afford to keep them in running order. Incidents In 1982 the John Glenn, and the city's other vessels tried to rescue people when an Air Florida airliner collided with the 14th Street Bridge. Ice impeded their efforts. Seventy people died in the incident. Subsequently, the John Glenn was retro-fitted with an icebreaking bow.

He trained under James K. Wilson from 1865‚Äì1873, worked on his own between 1873‚Äì1888, and then with Wilson again from 1895-1901. He worked with William R. Brown from 1889‚Äì1895 and with E. N. Lamm from 1901-1909. His work is distinctive for its creative combinations of shaping, massing, and materials, and Crapsey is known especially for his design of churches. He was born in Fairmount, Ohio and died in Cincinnati. Crapsey began his career working mainly on the design of residences. He designed the Shingle Style Nathan F. Baker House on Madison Rd. in East Walnut Hills (1883) for the sculptor and relative of Crapsey's mentor James K. Wilson. A print and floor plan of the house appeared in the June 9, 1883 American Architect and Building News.N.F. Baker House E. Walnut Hills June 9, 1883 American Architect and Building News He also designed a \\"Five- Thousand-Dollar Suburban Home\\" in the Cincinnati suburb of Hartwell in 1886, and some commercial buildings. Crapsey & Brown specialized in church architecture. Crapsey belonged to the Methodist church and obtained several commissions for their buildings. Brown had already been doing church design before they teamed up. According to the Architectural Foundation of Cincinnati, \\"They were among the first firm to exploit the \\"Akron Plan\\", which included Sunday School rooms within the main Church building connected by moveable screens.\\" These \\"were sought after by many Protestant denominations, not only in Ohio and Kentucky, but as far as a $300,000 Presbyterian Church for Seattle, Washington\\" which was designed by Crapsey & Lamm in 1906. He and his partners also designed church-related educational buildings including a dormitory for Ohio Wesleyan College (Delaware, Ohio) in 1889 and Methodist missionary schools and chapels in China. Crapsey's obituary in the Western Architect & Builder \\"made a specialty of church architecture, and as much as, perhaps more, than any other architect of the country, developed the institutional church building,\\" and an obituary in The Western Christian Advocate described Crapsey as \\"an architect by instinct and training.\\" Honorary pallbearers representing the American Institute of ARchitects included James W. McLaughlin, S.S. Godley, and George W. Rapp, \\"all major Cincinnati architects during the second half of the 19th century\\". Real pallbearers were selected from members of his Bible class. A double-page magazine feature of Crapsey & Brown's churches was published in the American Architect & Building News, XXXVIII, 822 November 19, 1892, including examples in Cincinnati and Kenton, Ohio, and Maysville, Mayslick, Carlisle, Covington, and Dayton, Kentucky. They were also active in Hamilton, Ohio and Winchester, Kentucky (where Lamm seems to have been a builder, and perhaps designer, early in his career).Ohio Churches by Crapsey and Brown XXXVIII, 822 November 19, 1892 American Architect & Building News The spread also included prices such as $27,000 Kenton, Ohio church and $10,000 for the Price Hill Cincinnati church with \\"stones to window sills and shingles above\\". Crapsey & Brown used a wide variety of materials, often in combination achieving great variety in shape, massing, and effect. Crapsey competed for the design of the Cincinnati Centennial Exposition building (1887; won by H.E. Siter; expo held 1888) and the Cincinnati Armory (won by Samuel Hannaford; 1887). Projects Known churches and other commissions in Ohio were located in London, Fostoria, Loveland, Ironton, Waynesville, Portsmouth, Woodstock, Xenia, Franklin, Washington Court House, Lima, Jackson, Mechanicsburg, Miamisburg, Milford, Columbus, Carthage and areas of Cincinnati. In Kentucky his projects included buildings in Henderson, Newport, Richmond, Mount Sterling, Danville, Augusta and Ludlow.

Maysville, Kentucky has \\"a particularly important grouping\\" of churches, commercial buildings, a Masonic Lodge, and residences, \\"all within a block of each other and still remarkably intact.\\" According to the Architectural Foundation of Cincinnati, the best surviving churches are the First English Lutheran, Race St. and 12th St. opposite Washington Park (1894); Clifton Methodist, SEC Clifton Ave. and Senator Place (1891); and the Price Hill M.E., NWC Phillips and Considine avenues (now the Church of the Nazarene; 1895). Their smaller churches also have charm. They \\"have a recognizable, distinctive, and \\"artistic\\" character; among their late 19th-century contemporaries, they are more individual and even fantastic than Samuel Hannaford or McLaughlin, although usually less so than (for example) Buddemeyer, Plympton & Trowbridge. The Clifton United Methodist (1892) Church at 3416 Clifton Avenue in Cincinnati is a Richardsonian Romanesque style building by Charles completed in 1892. It includes an Akron plan and an interior with vaulted timberwork, wooden trusses and LaFarge and Armstrong (John LaFarge and Maitland and Helen Armstrong) stained glass window. Walter E.

It was first broadcast on 26 December (Boxing Day) 1988. It falls between Series 6 and Series 7 of Minder, but, like Minder on the Orient Express, which preceded it, it follows a stand-alone storyline. It was the last appearance of Patrick Malahide as Chisholm. Plot Terry has been convicted of receiving stolen goods - actually stored in his flat by Arthur - and emerges from prison after serving 16 months, determined to have nothing further to do with Arthur. Meanwhile, Arthur has done well for himself, operating a large warehouse and import/export operation, employing several staff and driving a Rolls Royce. One of his customers is self-styled 'Colonel' Caplan, who operates a military- style executive survival programme from his country estate. Terry is recommended for a job as a gardener/handyman on the estate by Angie, an employee of Arthur's. But no one knows that she's actually an under-cover police officer, investigating the possibility of nefarious activities between Arthur and Caplan. These suspicions appear justified when a consignment of CS gas is found in the warehouse, Arthur claiming not to know how it got there. It emerges that Caplan and his staff are planning a military-style gold bullion robbery. The transport is being guarded by a security company, whose Chief Security Officer is ex-Sergeant Chisholm, and one of the guards is in Caplan's pay. Investigating further, Arthur, Terry, DS Rycott, DC Jones and Angie are held captive at the estate whilst the robbery goes down. But thanks to the defective equipment supplied by Arthur, it fails and the police manage to get there in time to nab the thieves. A confrontation with senior police leads to Arthur being stripped of his business interests (and possibly arrest), Chisholm close to a second nervous breakdown, and Rycott and Jones getting a major roasting. Only Terry escapes unscathed.

Partido da Imprensa Golpista (PiG, ) is a term used by left-wing Brazilian websurfers since 2007 to characterize an alleged attitude of the Brazilian mass media towards President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva during the 2006 presidential election. The term was popularized by journalist Paulo Henrique Amorim in his blog. Whenever he uses the term, Amorim writes it with an \\"i\\" in lowercase as a pun with the name of the web portal where he was a journalist before he was dismissed on March 18, 2008, which he describes as a process of \\"ideological cleansing\\". The term is also used by journalists Luiz Carlos Azenha and Rodrigo Vianna on their blogs, which also helped to spread its popularity. The term gained notoriety when it was first used in the Brazilian Congress in a speech by Pernambuco Congressman Fernando Ferro, a member of the Workers' Party. He said that film director and Rede Globo commentator Arnaldo Jabor should run for \\"President of the PIG\\".  Definition  Paulo Henrique Amorim explains the expression whenever he uses it in his articles. According to him, \\"In no serious democracy in the world, conservative, low-quality and even sensationalistic newspapers, and one single television network matter as much as they do in Brazil. They have become a political party ‚Äì the PiG, Pro-coup Press Party\\".Translated from: \\"Em nenhuma democracia s√©ria do mundo, jornais conservadores, de baixa qualidade t√©cnica e at√© sensacionalistas, e uma √∫nica rede de televis√£o t√™m a import√¢ncia que t√™m no Brasil. Eles se transformaram num partido pol√≠tico ‚Äì o PiG, Partido da Imprensa Golpista.\\" Amorim said that some politicians have become part of the PiG. He said that \\"the political parties are no longer an instrument of the coup but they have become the coup itself. Pretending [to do] objective journalism, they not only do the job of a press that omits information; but do the job of a press that lies, distorts and deceits. Former President FHC was among the first politicians who realized that the political strength he needed could be found in the PIG, and thus nowadays he enjoys the image of being a prominent world leader\\".UCB. Paulo Henrique Amorim fala sobre ‚ÄúPIG‚Äù e jornalismo na Internet. Bras√≠lia: Oficina de Produ√ß√£o de Not√≠cias, Curso de Comunica√ß√£o Social, Universidade Cat√≥lica de Bras√≠lia; October 27, 2009  Historical background  Paulo Henrique said that the mainstream Brazilian press historically defends coup d'√©tats whenever the Brazilian President is not elected from among members of the ruling elites. The PIG, according to Amorim, had its origin with Carlos Lacerda, whom he says \\"helped to kill Get√∫lio Vargas\\". It continued its \\"struggle against democracy\\" throughout the governments of Juscelino Kubitscheck and Jo√£o Goulart, when finally \\"it openly defended and promoted the Brazilian military putsch of March 1964\\". According to him, the mass media also \\"hammered Rio's governor Brizola throughout his two terms in office, and now conspires against Lula\\". Political scientist Wanderley Guilherme dos Santos, who predicted the overthrow of President Jo√£o Goulart in 1964, said in an interview with CartaCapital in 2005 that the \\"mainstream media led Vargas to commit suicide based on nothing; it almost prevented Juscelino from taking office based on nothing; it led to J√¢nio resignation, taking advantage of his craziness, based on nothing; it tried to prevent Goulart's inauguration based on nothing\\".Dias, Mauricio.

S√£o Paulo: Revista Carta Capital, 10 de junho de 2005  Inconsistencies of the term creator In September 1998, on the eve of the dispute between Lula (Brazilian left candidate, from PT party) and FHC (seen as the right candidate, but with center-left trend, from PSDB party), Amorim led a crusade against Lula on TV Bandeirantes. In an ongoing battle, Amorim attacked Lula in all editions of the main news program of Bandeirantes.Complaint against Lula paralyzes campaignPaulo Henrique Amorim is the bravest journalist from Brazil to attack the reputation of the opposition Lula sued Paulo Henrique Amorim and TV Bandeirantes, who apologized to PT publicly.

He argues that \\"the PIG is strong, is Goliath, but the internet is filled with Davids\\". Campos says that the mere existence of the internet interferes with the monopoly of information by large media groups, and this interference hampers coups. Supposed members  According to Paulo Henrique Amorim, only three Brazilian families control the mainstream Brazilian media: the Marinhos (Roberto Marinho, Organiza√ß√µes Globo), the Mesquitas (Julio de Mesquita, Grupo Estado) and the Frias (Oct√°vio Frias, Grupo Folha). According to Amorim, they dominate and condition news in Brazil, through their various newspapers, radio stations, news agencies and internet blogs. They have provoked what Amorim calls \\"a massacre\\" of the smaller Brazilian regional press, as a consequence of the control they exert on all of the mainstream information, in order to manipulate the Brazilian public opinion. Professor S√©rgio Mattos, writing in 2005 on media control and censorship in Brazil and elsewhere, also cited the influence of these tycoons, adding, however, two other groups: : Mattos's work precedes the creation of the term \\"PIG\\" and although talk about the manipulation of information by the media, is much more a warning about the dangers of state control (open or hidden) over the press, warning which was hailed as \\"very useful\\" in the book review done by the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo in 2006. In May 2013, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Brazil, Joaquim Barbosa, in a speech in Costa Rica during World Press Freedom Day, said that there is a lack of political and ideological diversity in the Brazilian press and identified a right-wing bias in that group: :  Criticism  As one of the main drivers of the acronym \\"PiG\\", Paulo Henrique Amorim is accused by the conservative journalist Reinaldo Azevedo of promoting two eternal campaigns: one electoral, and another against the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo and its managing editor. Azevedo said that everything would be done under the auspices of the Brazilian Government, through the advertising budget of a state bank, the Caixa Econ√¥mica Federal. According to opponents of the term, the press denounces irregularities in public administration, like several well-known cases of corruption. J.R. Guzzo, \\"Veja\\"'s columnist, questioned the term \\"PiG\\", saying that when the press publishes complaints it is accused by the government of \\"destabilizing\\" Brazil. So, the use of the term would be an attempt to put the population against the press. According to journalist Pedro Doria, the manifestation of an ideological polarity is intolerant and unable to explain a complex social reality.Ideological intolerance and the world as it is Sergio Leo believes that the mainstream press is too complex to be labeled this way because it would encompass very different opinions and agendas. However, the President of the Associa√ß√£o Nacional de Jornais ‚Äì ANJ (\\"National Newspaper Association\\") Maria Judith Brito said the Brazilian press has assumed the role of a political agent in the 2010 presidential election. Brito is an executive of the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper and was once a candidate for councilwoman for the Workers' Party. Brito said that the media has taken on the role of the opposition to the Lula administration: About Brito's speech, journalist Luciano Martins Costa of Observat√≥rio da Imprensa said that:  See also  * Censorship in Brazil * Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff * 2002 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat attempt * Chojoongdong, a similar South Korean phenomenon * Concentration of media ownership  References  External links  * UNESCO releases three publications analyzing media regulation and freedom of expression in Brazil *Reporters Without Borders. \\"\\" * O partido m√≠dia e o crime organizado Category:Internet culture Category:Internet memes Category:Words coined in the 2000s Category:Brazilian journalism Category:Media bias controversies ","title":"Partido da Imprensa Golpista"},{"id":"25812436","text":"Higbie Avenue was a railroad station along the Atlantic Branch of the Long Island Rail Road, in Queens, New York City.

It is named after the two British physicians, John Patterson Hughes and Peter George Ingle Stovin, who first described it in 1959. It is a rare variant of Beh√ßet's disease, which entails more general problems with the circulatory system. Most patients are young adult males between the age of 20‚Äì40. Common clinical presentations include fever, cough, dyspnea and hemoptysis. Radiological features are similar to those of Beh√ßet's disease. Signs and symptoms * Multiple pulmonary aneurysms * Peripheral venous thrombosis * Recurrent fever * Chills * Hemoptysis * Cough Diagnosis There is no rigid set of diagnostic criteria for Hughes-Stovin. According to QJM, an international medical journal published by Oxford Press, Hughes-Stovin can be discerned from similar conditions by its resemblance to vasculitis without a presenting infection. The syndrome is also identified as being \\"characterized by pulmonary/bronchial artery aneurysms and thrombophlebitis, without diagnostic features of Beh√ßet's disease (BD).\\" Management There is currently no satisfactory treatment for this condition. This is partly due to its rarity; the Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases claims that fewer than forty cases of the disease have been described in English medical literature. Immunosuppressive therapy is the most common treatment, involving a mix of glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide. This is most effective in the early stages and may cause remission of the aneurysms, but is ineffective once the disease has progressed. According to the Orphanet Journal, treatments, including ventilator, surgery and transcatheter arterial embolization are also used.

Formed in Social Sciences, master and doctor in the area and for years devoted himself to the study and teaching of anthropology, with an emphasis on folklore and the tradition of Minas Gerais. Thesis He defended his dissertation with the biography of the bandit Antonio D√≥, and his doctoral thesis entitled \\"Contribution to the scientific study of the craft,\\" both published in book form. Contributions to anthropology As a writer attentive to the nuances of popular culture and to the forms of \\"traditional‚Äù sociability set inside of the country-side of Minas Gerais, especially the \\"rodas de S√£o Gon√ßalo\\", Martins left a legacy for the description and systematization forms of cultural expression of Brazil's country-side. Defending a systematic study of these forms of expression, and deeply influenced by the positivism of Auguste Comte and √âmile Durkheim, the anthropologist defended the folklore as a \\"first form\\" (or, using the durkheimnian jargon, the \\"elementary form\\") used in the culture of a society. His name was given to the \\"Museum of Craft Saul Alves Martins\\", located in the city of Vespasiano/Minas Gerais/Brazil, categorized as one of the top five museums of popular culture in Brazil.SENAC One should notice that the museum has a collection of a large number of works donated by the anthropologist, the fruit of his research and fieldwork. Poetry Martins was also a poet, publishing several books in this genre, as well as contributions to compilations. As an example of his production in this area is worth mentioning the poem \\"Flores do Campo\\" (trans: \\"Flowers of the Field\\") as one of the ten best of the contemporary sonnets in Minas Gerais, which led to the anthropologist the award received by the Academy of Letters of Minas Gerais in 1951. Here is a fragment of the sonnet: {  : Belas flores de p√©talas bordadas, :De raro odor e de apar√™ncia austera, :Lindo jardim que a natureza gera :Para alegrar a vida nas chapadas.  : Fine flowers with embroidered petals, :Of rare odor and austere appearance, :Beautiful garden that nature generates :To brighten the lives in uplands. } Besides his work as an anthropologist, he became a colonel and commanded battalions in Belo Horizonte. He is the author of the official anthem of the Military Police of Minas Gerais (PMMG), pointing to his poetic bias. Published works *Can√ß√£o da Terra.(Poesia). 1¬™ Edi√ß√£o .Belo Horizonte.

It tells the story of an overweight Jewish female journalist, her love and work life and her emotional abuse issues with her father. The novel was a New York Times Best Seller.https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/08/books/paperback-best-sellers- september-8-2002.html?pagewanted=2 Aspects of the plot were inspired by Weiner's own life. Plot summary Candace (Cannie) Shapiro is a smart, sarcastic, and successful entertainment journalist living in Philadelphia. Although she has a small group of close friends, including her best friend Samantha, her overbearing but caring mother, and her rat terrier, Nifkin, she has a day to day struggle with her weight, a recent breakup with her boyfriend of three years, and the relationship issues left on her when her father left her as a child. One day, she reads a magazine article written by her ex- boyfriend, Bruce, telling his opinions on \\"loving a larger woman,\\" simply naming the woman as \\"C.\\" Outraged and humiliated, Cannie approaches Bruce hoping to get some answers, but only makes things worse when she loses her temper and causes him to say it's over between them for good. However, a few weeks later when Cannie learns that Bruce's father had died, she attends the funeral to give her condolences and maybe make things better between her and Bruce. Things don't go exactly as planned, but Cannie and Bruce end up having sex. Cannie thinks this may be the start of them getting back together, but is hurt when Bruce says they should no longer see each other, as he is seeing someone else. Trying to forget about Bruce, Cannie decides to fix up her life a little bit by attending a weight-loss program, making her job a little more pleasurable, and trying to get the screenplay she wrote into the hands of a Hollywood producer. While in New York for an interview with celebrity Maxi Rider, she becomes close friends with Maxi. Cannie decides to give her the screenplay. Later at her weight-loss program, Cannie meets with the program's doctor, Dr. K, to discuss her role in the program. Dr. K, however, breaks the news to her that she is not allowed to participate in the program. Cannie is crushed at first, until Dr. K tells her she is not allowed to participate because she is pregnant. Cannie considers the news and realizes Bruce had gotten her pregnant the day of his father's funeral. She debates abortion and whether she should tell Bruce or not. She ultimately decides to keep the baby and writes a note to Bruce telling him she was pregnant and if he wants a part in his child's life, they should talk. Bruce never responds to the letter and Cannie decides she will raise her child as a single mother. A few months go by and Cannie, knowing she's going to be a mother and having fallen in love with her baby, is a little happier with her life. She is on good terms with all her friends including Maxi, her mother, even Dr. K (whom she now knows as Peter), who are all supportive of her choice to be a single mom. Things get even better when Maxi tells Cannie she read her screenplay and some producers in Hollywood want to produce it, but she must fly to Hollywood and help with the movie. Cannie agrees and packs her bags for Hollywood. In Hollywood, Cannie is living the dream staying with Maxi in her L.A. house, attending exclusive parties, and even talking to her celebrity crush. She even considers moving from Philadelphia, but decides against the idea. After a few weeks in California, Cannie returns home. After getting off her flight, Cannie walks through the airport and spots Bruce and whom she assumes is Bruce's new girlfriend. She briefly talks to Bruce and is rude to his girlfriend. After walking away, she goes to the bathroom but is followed by Bruce's girlfriend. They get into a bit of an argument and Cannie slips on some water and falls, hitting her pregnant belly on the side of the sink. Cannie wakes up in the hospital confused, until her friends tell her that she'll be fine, but will never be able to have children again, due to her injury requiring her to have a hysterectomy. Her new daughter, Joy, was born prematurely but will be okay as long as she stays in the hospital for a few more weeks. Cannie soon falls into a deep depression after the incident and slowly pushes her friends and family away. She starts taking long walks through the city and starts eating very little, causing her to lose weight. During one walk through the city, she becomes lost, but finds herself at Peter's office. Peter, aware of her mental state, takes her to his place, lets her shower, and cooks her a warm meal. Cannie realizes how she's been acting, and Peter tells her how much he cares for her. When Joy is brought home from the hospital, Cannie decides to move into her mother's home but starts becoming more like herself every day. Peter and Cannie start dating, and Cannie seems at peace with her life again. She eventually moves back into her apartment, and Peter tells her he wants to move in with her. As one last change in her life, Cannie decides to go to the magazine Bruce worked for and introduce herself as \\"C.\\" She is immediately offered a job as writing the \\"Loving a Larger Woman\\" column. Publication Weiner initially had difficulty find an agent. As a former journalist, she was unfamiliar with how the publishing world operated, and she made errors when submitting her work. Once she found an agent with whom she could easily collaborate, she said the book was quickly published. Reception Entertainment Weekly rated it \\"A\\" and wrote, \\"Dealing with her prickly ex, a newly out mother, and some really unexpected news along the way, Cannie emerges as one of the most engaging, realistic female characters in years.\\" Publishers Weekly wrote, \\"Weiner's witty, original, fast-moving debut features a lovable heroine, a solid cast, snappy dialogue and a poignant take on life's priorities.\\" Notes Category:2001 American novels Category:Chick lit novels Category:Novels set in Philadelphia Category:2001 debut novels ","title":"Good in Bed"},{"id":"25812500","text":"The King George Hall (KGH) of the University of Colombo in Colombo is one of the oldest theatres of Sri Lanka.

Steinberg (born 1970) is the founder and chief executive officer of Zeta Global, formerly Zeta Interactive and XL Marketing Corporation, one of several companies that he started. Zeta Global is a data-driven marketing and CRM company that integrates data, technology and marketing services, aiming to help brands acquire, grow and retain customers. Early life In 1991, Steinberg graduated from Washington & Jefferson College with a bachelor's degree in economics. Career In 1993, David Steinberg founded Sterling Cellular, Inc. in the basement of his house in Bethesda, Maryland with the use of credit cards and a parental loan. Sterling Cellular grossed $1.3 million in sales its first year in business. It was a business that sold cellular phones. Sterling offered free, timed delivery and a warranty/repair program and a free loaner phone program from its third month. By 1997 Sterling Cellular grew to 12 retail locations and $22 million in sales. In 1999, Steinberg broke up Sterling Cellular by selling off the retail chain and telemarketing operations of Sterling Cellular and founding Inphonic. Over a seven-year period, Inphonic grew into the largest seller of new cell phones on the internet with over $300 million in revenue. As the public face for Inphonic, he was praised for creating and growing the online business that dominates online sales for cell phones. He was criticized for growing the business too rapidly at the cost of customer service and revenue. This contributed to the downfall of Inphonic when the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010 began in 2007 with the credit squeeze on all companies. In November 2007, after Steinberg resigned as CEO and Chairman of the Board, InPhonic filed a Chapter 11 petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. In December, InPhonic was acquired by Versa Capital Management and relaunched as Simplexity. After Inphonic, Steinberg secured support to start a new corporation, CAIVIS Acquisition Corp. According to their website, CAIVIS Acquisition Corp is an investment firm looking to purchase small companies in the internet space and combine them in order to maximize their opportunities. CAIVIS acts like a holding company, aiming to achieve an economy of scale for the standard infrastructure required for internet businesses, such as human resources, legal and accounting departments. At the same time it aims for multiple arbitrage by combining the smaller companies into a larger business. Small companies typically command a price‚Äìearnings ratio (PE) of 5 while larger companies command a PE of 10. In 2011, Steinberg started XL Marketing Corp with John Sculley. On January 30, 2014, Steinberg moderated a marketing panel hosted by Zeta Interactive on the changes in advertising and marketing over the years, using Apple's 1984 commercial as a benchmark. John Sculley was a panelist with advertising executive David Sable, Global CEO of Young & Rubicam; Jessica Gelman, Vice President of Customer Marketing & Strategy; The Kraft Group‚Äîthe owners of the New England Patriots; and Hooman Radfar, Chairman and Co-Founder of marketing firm AddThis. He has served on the Washington & Jefferson College Board of Trustees.  Zeta Global  Zeta Global, (formerly Zeta International) is an example of the CAIVIS strategy. Several small companies specializing in different facets of online marketing were acquired and combined to create the firm. The company is a full service big dat, customer acquisition, and customer relationship management services firm. XL Marketing in June 2012 it raised capital of $70 million. It acquired rival Intela and the Adchemy Actions division with that $70 million. In January 2014, XL was re-branded as Zeta Interactive. In July 2015, the company raised $125 million from Blackstone's GSO Capital Partners to grow its business through acquisitions of data startup companies. The company has been referred to by Forbes magazine as a 'Unicorn,' a \\"billion-dollar startup\\". Zeta calls its approach to data-driven marketing \\"precision marketing\\". In October 2016, Zeta Interactive became Zeta Global. In April 2017, Steinberg continued building Zeta Global with a $140 million fundraiser, valuing the company at close to 1.3 billion dollars.

Its primary product is a handmade glass votive, also known as a \\"glassybaby\\", produced in more than four hundred colors and sold over the internet and through a few retail stores in the Seattle area and San Francisco. Their tagline is \\"one of a kindness.\\" The company donates money from sales to charities helping cancer patients with costs during chemotherapy, and other charities \\"dedicated to healing\\". History In 1995, at the age of 32, Lee Rhodes was stricken with a third round of a rare form of lung cancer. The mother of three had previously given her then husband, Emery Rhodes, glass blowing lessons, and he created small glass cups, or \\"baby glasses\\", which she would light with tea light candles to find solace during the difficult cancer treatments.\\"Small Retail: It's the inner glow that sells handblown Glassybabys\\" Seattle Post Intelligencer 2/15/2008 Encouraged by the demand from her friends, Rhodes hired local glassblowers in 1998 to produce more glassybaby, and began selling them out of her garage. From the beginning, Rhodes wanted to spread hope and give back money from sales to help cancer patients. \\"glassybaby allow people to take that 30 seconds of peace and calm to find healing,\\" says Rhodes, \\"I see people who come into glassybaby hurting. They still mean to other people what they meant to me. I feel joy that we created something that touches so many people.\\" The company was officially founded in 2001. In 2003, Rhodes set up a glassblowing studio in Seattle‚Äôs old Vitamilk Dairy building, since demolished. In September 2005, Rhodes appeared with Martha Stewart on her television show. Sales, which had reportedly been averaging about 4 a day, leaped to 400, and although the surge slowed somewhat, the impact on the glassybaby business was tremendous. In 2007, glassybaby moved to a studio and retail shop in Seattle‚Äôs Madrona neighborhood.

Therefore, they instead believed in the Imamate of his brother Muhammad ibn Ali al-Hadi, who died 7 years before the death of his father. However, the Muhammadites denied the death of Muhammad, and claimed that his father had pointed to him and appointed him as the Imam to succeed himself, and had mentioned him by his name and person. These beliefs, falsely according to them, are what were agreed by all. To support their position, they believed it was impossible for the Imam to point through will to one who was not the Imam. Therefore, to support this belief, they argued that Muhammad ibn Ali al-Hadi did not die in reality, as was apparent.

These effects can develop over time with regular use or can be the result of an acute intoxication due to a single intake of the substance. Cocaine dependence inevitably leads to effects of cocaine intoxication that can sometimes be completely reversed without bearing consequences but that can also potentially kill the users (e.g., in cases of untreated or non-manageable overdoses). Signs and symptoms Cocaine increases alertness, feelings of well-being, euphoria, energy, competence, sociability, and sexuality. Mild adverse effects include anxiety, increased temperature, paranoia, restlessness, and teeth grinding. With prolonged use, the drug can cause chronic complications like insomnia, weight loss, anorexia, persistent tachycardia, heart failure, kidney failure, hallucinations, and paranoid delusions. Depression with suicidal ideation may develop in heavy users. Finally, a loss of vesicular monoamine transporters, neurofilament proteins, and other morphological changes appear to indicate a long-term damage to dopamine neurons. Chronic intranasal usage can degrade the cartilage separating the nostrils (the nasal septum), which can eventually lead to its complete disappearance. Studies have shown that cocaine usage during pregnancy triggers premature labor and may lead to abruptio placentae. In cases of severe acute intoxication, potentially lethal adverse effects include prolonged episodes of arrhythmia (i.e., a group of abnormal heart rhythms that also include tachycardia), heavy hypoglycemia, tremors, convulsions, hyperthermia (i.e., markedly increased core temperature), untreated uremia, myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden cardiac arrest. Overdose US yearly overdose deaths involving cocaine.Overdose Death Rates. By National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). synthetic opioids. Cocaine can be snorted, swallowed, injected, or smoked. Most deaths due to cocaine are accidental but may also be the result of body packing or stuffing with rupture in the gastrointestinal tract. Use of cocaine causes abnormally fast heart rhythms and a marked elevation of blood pressure (hypertension), which can be life- threatening. This can lead to death from acute myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure (i.e., hypoxemia, with or without hypercapnia), stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, and sudden cardiac arrest. Cocaine overdose may result in hyperthermia as stimulation and increased muscular activity cause greater heat production. Heat loss is also inhibited by the cocaine-induced vasoconstriction. Cocaine and/or associated hyperthermia may cause muscle cell destruction (rhabdomyolysis) and myoglobinuria resulting in kidney failure. Individuals with cocaine overdose should be transported immediately to the nearest emergency department, preferably by ambulance in case cardiac arrest occurs en route. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, approximately 14,600 deaths occurred in the US in 2017 due to cocaine overdose. Because of the increase in heart rate, cocaine users can be prone to elevated body temperatures, tremors, chest pains, and subject to nausea and vomiting. Some psychological symptoms due to an overdose include paranoia, delirium, anxiety as well as panicked feelings. Some signs of an overdose of cocaine are difficulty breathing, loss of urine control, bluish color of the skin, loss of awareness or surroundings, and high blood pressure. Although not as common, death can be caused from an over intoxication of cocaine. Most severe overdoses occur when users combine cocaine with other substances like alcohol or heroin, which increase the effects and heighten the chances of having a dangerous overdose. Treating an overdose can be done by bringing back blood flow to the heart, and restoring the body with oxygen rich blood, especially for the brain to reduce the risk of stroke. Cocaine overdoses have fluctuated over the years. From 2006 to 2010 there has been a decline in the number of reported cases. Though, from 2010 to 2015 there has been an increase in the reported cases involving over cocaine Intoxication. As far as gender goes, it's found that males have a much higher chance of overdosing than females. The ratio of male to female cocaine overdoses is 3:1. Withdrawal Cocaine withdrawal isn't as severe as the withdrawal from other substances. For example, substances like alcohol and benzodiazepines can involve severe physical withdrawal symptoms while cocaine results in mostly psychological symptoms. Physiological changes caused by cocaine withdrawal include vivid and unpleasant dreams, insomnia, hypersomnia, anger, increased appetite, weight gain, psychomotor retardation, agitation, depression, and anxiety. According to a study done by Gawin and Kleber in 1986, there are three phases in the withdrawal process. They observed the behavior of 30 cocaine-dependent individuals. Phase one, the crash, is characterized by acute dysphoria, irritability and anxiety, increased desire for sleep, exhaustion, increased appetite, decreased craving to use. Phase two, withdrawal, is characterized by increasing craving to use, poor concentration, some irritability and some lethargy, which persisted for up to 10 weeks. Lastly, phase three is characterized by the intermittent craving to use in the context of external cues. Cocaine and its metabolites are completely eliminated from the body by 3 days. There are not any FDA-approved medications that specifically help treat cocaine withdrawal, however, there are some useful medications that could possibly help individuals overcome their addiction. One example is propranolol. Propranolol is a beta blocker that has been approved to treat hypertension, angina, anxiety, and other related psychological problems. Buprenorphine and naltrexone are two substances that act as an effective treatment in the earlier stages of withdrawal. Pathophysiology Cocaine pharmacodynamics involve multiple complex mechanisms. Although it has a short half-life (~ 1 hour), cocaine metabolites, which rise in concentrations several hours after cocaine ingestion, persist in circulation for up to 24 hours, and may cause delayed or recurrent coronary vasoconstriction. This drug binds and blocks monoamine (dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and serotonin) re-uptake transporters with equal affinity. Monoamines accumulate in the synaptic cleft resulting in enhanced and prolonged sympathetic effects. Cocaine's acute effect in the central nervous system is to raise the amount of dopamine and serotonin in the nucleus accumbens (the pleasure center in the brain). When this effect ceases due to metabolism of cocaine, depletion of associated neurotransmitters, and receptor down-regulation (tachyphylaxis), the cocaine user may experience dysphoria, or a \\"crash\\" after the initial high. The principal actions of cocaine on the cardiovascular system are from alpha- and beta-1-adrenoceptor stimulation resulting in increased heart rate, systemic arterial pressure, and myocardial contractility, which are major determinants of myocardial oxygen demand. Cocaine and its metabolites may cause arterial vasoconstriction hours after use. Epicardial coronary arteries are especially vulnerable to these effects, leading to decreased myocardial oxygen supply. Cocaine-induced platelet activation and thrombus formation is another deleterious effect, caused by alpha-adrenergic- and adenosine diphosphate-mediated increase in platelet aggregation. Plasminogen activator inhibitor is also increased following cocaine use, thereby promoting thrombosis. Similar to local anesthetics such as lidocaine, cocaine blocks sodium channels and interferes with action potential propagation. This Vaughn-Williams class IC effect increases the risk of conduction disturbance and tachyarrhythmias. Adding to its complex toxicity, cocaine targets muscarinic acetylcholine, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), sigma, and kappa-opioid receptors. Management 112 for an ambulance.\\" Emergency treatment of cocaine-associated high body temperature consists of giving a benzodiazepine and physical cooling. Cooling is best accomplished with tepid water misting and cooling with a fan. There is no specific antidote for cocaine. The chest pain, high blood pressure, and increased heart rate caused by cocaine may be also treated with benzodiazepines. Multiple and escalating dose of benzodiazepines may be necessary to achieve effect, which increases risk of over-sedation and respiratory depression. A review of cocaine cardiovascular toxicity found benzodiazepines may not always reliably lower heart rate and blood pressure. Nitric-oxide mediated vasodilators, such as nitroglycerin and nitroprusside, are effective at lowering blood pressure and reversing coronary arterial vasoconstriction, but not heart rate. Nitroglycerin is useful for cocaine- induced chest pain, but the possibility of reflex tachycardia must be considered. Alpha-blockers such as phentolamine have been recommended and may be used to treat cocaine-induced hypertension and coronary arterial vasoconstriction, but these agents do not reduce heart rate. Furthermore, phentolamine is rarely used, not readily available in many emergency departments, and many present-day clinicians are unfamiliar with its use. The use of beta-blockers for cocaine toxicity has been a relative contraindication despite limited evidence. The phenomenon of ‚Äúunopposed alpha-stimulation,‚Äù in which blood pressure increases or coronary artery vasoconstriction worsens after blockade of beta-2 vasodilation in people using cocaine, is controversial. This rarely-encountered and unpredictable adverse effect has resulted in some clinicians advocating for an absolute contraindication of all beta-blockers, including specific, non-specific, and mixed. Many clinicians have disregarded this dogma and administer beta-blockers for cocaine-related chest pain and acute coronary syndrome, especially when there is demand ischemia from uncontrolled tachycardia. Of the 1,744 people in the aforementioned systematic review, only 7 adverse events were from putative cases of ‚Äúunopposed alpha-stimulation‚Äù due to propranolol (n=3), esmolol (n=3), and metoprolol (n=1). Some detractors of beta-blockers for cocaine- induced chest pain have cited minimal acute mortality and the short half-life of the medication, making it unnecessary to aggressively treat any associated tachycardia and hypertension. However, the long-term effect of cocaine use and development of heart failure, with early mortality, high morbidity, and tremendous demand on hospital utilization should be taken under consideration. Although the use of beta blockers is still controversial, notwithstanding decades of clinical practice and a massive production of peer-reviewed research papers (more details are in the next section), the intravenous racemic mixtureRobertson D, Biaggioni, I. Adrenoceptor Antagonist Drugs. In: Katzung BG, Masters SB, Trevor AJ, eds. Basic & Clinical Pharmacology. 12th ed. San Francisco, CA: McGraw Hill Lange Medical; 2012: 151-168. . of Labetalol, a non-selective Œ≤ blocker and selective Œ±1 blocker is recommended for treating concomitant hypertension and tachycardia. The use of Labetalol is approved by a AHA/ACC guideline for people who have used cocaine and methamphetamine with unstable angina/non-STEMI. Calcium channel blockers may also be used to treat hypertension and coronary arterial vasoconstriction, but fail to lower tachycardia based on all cocaine-related studies. Non- dihydropyridine calcium channels blockers such as diltiazem and verapamil are preferable, as dihydropyridine agents such as nifedipine have much higher risk of reflex tachycardia (however, clinicians can prevent reflex tachycardia by administering beta-blockers some minutes before using the latter class of CCBs). People who are agitated are best treated with benzodiazepines, though antipsychotics such as haloperidol and olanzapine may also be useful. The alpha-2 agonist dexmedetomidine may also be useful for agitation, but effects on heart rate and blood pressure are variable based on several studies and case reports. Lidocaine and intravenous lipid emulsion have been successfully used for serious ventricular tachyarrhythmias in several case reports.

The landing was conducted as part of a change in responsibility for Allied operations on New Britain. The Australian 5th Division, under Major General Alan Ramsay, took over from the US 40th Infantry Division, which was needed for operations in the Philippines. The purpose of the operation was to establish a logistics base at Jacquinot Bay on the south coast of New Britain to support the 5th Division's planned operations near the major Japanese garrison at Rabaul. Brigadier Raymond Sandover's 6th Brigade was directed to secure the Jacquinot Bay area. While the region was believed to be undefended, the initial landing was conducted by a combat-ready force comprising the reinforced Australian 14th/32nd Battalion protected by warships and with aircraft on standby. As expected, there was no opposition to the landing on 4 November and work soon began on logistics facilities. Once a base was established at Jacquinot Bay, it was used to support Australian operations toward Rabaul. These were conducted in early 1945 in conjunction with advances on the northern side of New Britain. The campaign was effectively one of containment, isolating the larger Japanese force and allowing the Allies to conduct operations elsewhere. Background=Geography Jacquinot Bay lies on the south coast of the island of New Britain, to the east of Gasmata and the west of Wide Bay.Long (1963), Map p. 243 The southern part of the island (i.e. excluding the Gazelle Peninsula and the isthmus) is dominated by a densely forested central mountain range. The range rises to and sits inland from a narrow coastal shelf.Allied Geographical Section (1943), p. 1 In 1943‚Äì1944, there were numerous small villages and localities around the bay. The main ones were Cutarp, a coconut plantation which lay on a headland to the north-east, and Palmalmal which lay to the south-west. In between, the village of Pomio lay on the northern shores of the bay. There was a coconut plantation around the southern part of the bay at Wunung, which was bounded by two freshwater rivers to the north and south, and another plantation around Palmalmal. A Roman Catholic mission was located at Mal Mal, although it was reportedly abandoned at the time. The beach opposite Pomio was considered suitable for landing operations, but between Pomio and Wunung, there was dense rainforest along the coast. Between Wunung and Palmalmal, the beach was considered suitable for landings, with some shelter offered to smaller vessels close in.Allied Geographical Section (1943), pp. 4, 8‚Äì9, 16 & 27 There were only limited tracks around the region, and those that existed were assessed as not being suitable for motor traffic without improvement.Allied Geographical Section (1943), p. 16 alt=Colour map of New Guinea, New Britain, New Ireland and Bougainville The region's climate was described as \\"hot and humid\\", with exceptionally high rainfall.Allied Geographical Section (1943), p. 34 The southern coastal region experienced a higher rainfall than the northern coast. The southern coast experienced a monsoon season during May to November, with the wettest period between July and September. Rain events were mainly at night or early morning. An Allied study completed in 1943 assessed average monthly rainfall at Palmalmal as in July, in August and in September. In the last quarter of the year, rainfall was assessed as declining, with November (the month of the operation) averaging around . Temperatures at the time were recorded at Gasmata as ranging between , although minimum temperatures largely averaged between and maximum temperatures averaged between . Humidity ranged between 75 and 85 percent. In terms of population, there were very few Europeans in the area prior to the war, with estimates ranging from 20 to 25. The indigenous population occupied several villages in the coastal area and the mountains, and were considered to form two main groups based around these areas.Allied Geographical Section (1943), pp. 30‚Äì40 The area around Jacquinot Bay was part of the Australian Territory of New Guinea, which had been mandated in 1920, and was considered to be under government control prior to the Japanese invasion.Allied Geographical Section (1943), pp. 1 & 31 It formed part of the Gasmata sub-district, with a government and police post situated at Pomio, and was administered by an assistant district officer who reported to Rabaul. During the withdrawal of Allied forces from Rabaul in early 1942, the local population along the south coast had assisted Allied stragglers, and were believed to be supportive of the Allied cause, albeit pragmatic in their approach to the Japanese occupation. Strategic situation During late 1943 and early 1944 Allied forces in the South West Pacific Area undertook Operation Cartwheel. This was a major offensive which aimed to isolate the main Japanese base in the area at Rabaul on the north-eastern tip of New Britain, and capture airstrips and anchorages which were needed to support a subsequent advance towards the Philippines. During December 1943 and January 1944 United States Army and United States Marine Corps units successfully landed in western New Britain at Arawe and Cape Gloucester. Japanese forces in western New Britain suffered a further defeat at Talasea in March 1944. Securing the western island prevented the Japanese launching attacks against the flank of the main Allied offensive along the north coast of New Guinea.Drea (1993), pp. 16‚Äì17 Allied operations to secure the Huon Peninsula and the Markham‚ÄìRamu Valley, on the New Guinea mainland concluded in April 1944 with the capture of Madang.Dexter (1961), p. 787 The focus of Allied operations on the mainland then turned towards securing Western New Guinea. The Admiralty Islands were captured during a campaign which lasted between 29 February and 18 May 1944.Keogh (1965), pp. 360‚Äì361 On Bougainville, a strong Japanese counter-attack had been repulsed in March 1944. A period of relative quiet followed until late 1944, after Australian forces relieved the US garrison (arriving from October).Keogh (1965), pp. 415‚Äì416 The Japanese Eighth Area Army, under General Hitoshi Imamura, was headquartered at Rabaul. Its area of operations encompassed the Solomon Islands chain (including Bougainville), mainland New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago (of which, New Britain was the largest island). It had suffered significant reversals on mainland New Guinea and in the Solomon Islands.Shindo (2016), pp. 53‚Äì59 With the loss of western New Britain, Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) forces were concentrated in the north-east of the island on the Gazelle Peninsula to defend Rabaul against a direct attack. The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) maintained a network of coastwatching stations along New Britain's coast. The Japanese garrisons and some local officials used brutality to try and rule the civilian population.Powell (1996), p. 245 In March 1944 the Eighth Area Army was directed by the General Staff to \\"hold the area around Rabaul for as long as possible, in cooperation with the Imperial Japanese Navy\\".Shindo (2016), p. 59 Until mid-1944 the Eighth Area Army believed that the Allies would conduct a major assault on Rabaul. After this time, they judged that the Allies were more likely to gradually expand their control over New Britain and only attack the town if their campaign towards Japan became bogged down or concluded, or if the size of Australian forces on the island was increased.Long (1963), pp. 266‚Äì267 In late April 1944, the US Army's 40th Infantry Division assumed responsibility for garrisoning the Allied positions in New Britain,Hough and Crown (1952), p. 207Grant (2016), p. 225 moving from Guadalcanal.Shaw and Kane (1963), p. 429 The use of an Australian formation to relieve the Marines had been considered at this time, but due to a lack of suitable shipping and equipment interoperability issues, the decision was made to temporarily defer this.Mallett (2007), p. 286 The 40th Infantry Division subsequently maintained positions around Talasea‚ÄìCape Hoskins, Arawe and Cape Gloucester and did not conduct offensive operations against the Japanese forces in the east of the island.Dennis et al (2008), p. 390 As a result, the fighting on New Britain devolved largely into what historian Peter Dennis has called a \\"tacit truce\\" with the US and Japanese troops being separated by a \\"no man's land\\", in which Australian-led native troops from the Allied Intelligence Bureau (AIB) conducted a small-scale guerilla campaign. A map of New Britain with key features related to the campaign In mid-1944, the Australian Government agreed to take on responsibility for military operations in the British and Australian territories and mandates in the South-West Pacific, including Australian New Guinea, of which New Britain was part, and the northern Solomon Islands. US troops were reallocated for operations to secure the Philippines.Keogh (1965), p. 396 In August, the Australian Army's 5th Division, under Major General Alan Ramsay, was selected to replace the 40th Infantry Division on New Britain. The formation was to assume responsibility for the island on 1 November.Long (1973), p. 405 Instead of maintaining the American bases in western New Britain the Australians planned to operate closer to the Japanese forces around the Gazelle Peninsula. By the time of the Australian take over, Allied intelligence estimated that the Japanese forces on New Britain amounted to 38,000 personnel, but in actuality there were 93,000 Japanese on the island.Long (1963), p. 241 The Japanese personnel were focused upon sustaining themselves, with rice-growing and gardening being undertaken to supplement the limited supplies that were arriving. Naval and air support for the force was limited, with only two aircraft capable of action and no ships other than 150 barges that could move up to 90 personnel or 15 tons of stores. As of April 1944, small Japanese observation posts were located along the south coast of New Britain as far west as the village of Awul, near Cape Dampier, approximately east of Arawe. There was an observation post at Jacquinot Bay. A larger force was stationed at Henry Reid Bay in the Wide Bay area.Long (1963), pp. 242‚Äì243 During that month the AIB force responsible for the south coast of New Britain was ordered to destroy all the Japanese posts to the west of Henry Reid Bay. This unit comprised about 140 native troops led by five Australian officers and ten Australian non- commissioned officers.Long (1963), pp. 242‚Äì244 Preliminary operations In mid-April, the coastwatching station at Jacquinot Bay was the first Japanese position to be attacked. A platoon of native troops led by two Australians attacked it after learning that it was lightly defended. Five of the ten IJN personnel stationed there were killed in the initial attack, and four of the survivors were hunted down and killed. The other Japanese sailor was taken prisoner. Two other Japanese sailors were taken prisoner in the Jacquinot Bay region on 22 April after the native troops attacked a barge. The three prisoners were evacuated by an American PT boat later that month. The IJN command responsible for New Britain was never able to determine the fate of the Jacquinot Bay garrison or the barge.Powell (1996), pp. 246‚Äì247 Broader operations against the Japanese observation posts began in June. On the fifth of the month a patrol of American troops attacked the position at Awul, causing its garrison to retreat into the centre of the island. Other attacks by the AIB force followed, and by early September all of the Japanese observation posts west of Wide Bay had been destroyed. Japanese troops conducted small-scale reprisals against the native population of the Wide Bay hinterland, and the AIB officers attempted to persuade the population of this area to move inland before more severe reprisals were conducted.Long (1963), pp. 244‚Äì245 During the operations along the south coast of New Britain, the AIB officers sought to discourage the Japanese from moving west of the Wide Bay area by circulating rumours among the local population that a large Australian base had been established at Jacquinot Bay. In reality no such base existed at this time.Long (1963), p. 245 The AIB force continued to make guerilla attacks on Japanese positions until early October, when it was ordered to cease offensive operations and concentrate on intelligence gathering ahead of the Australian landing at Jacquinot Bay.Long (1963), pp. 245‚Äì246 The AIB's operations from June to October were assisted on occasion by Allied air attacks and naval bombardments.Gill (1968), p. 490 Preparations A map of Australian operations in central New Britain between October 1944 and March 1945 To support the 5th Division's planned offensive operations the Australian high command in the New Guinea area, New Guinea Force, determined that a logistics base needed to be established closer to Rabaul than those used by the US Army forces on New Britain. At a conference held on 24 August involving the commanders of New Guinea Force and the 5th Division, it was decided to investigate whether the Talasea‚ÄìHoskins area on the north coast of New Britain and the Jacquinot Bay area on the south coast of the island could accommodate bases for the 5th Division.Long (1963), p. 248 The 5th Division had previously been deployed to New Guinea in 1943‚Äì1944, but had been reorganised for operations on New Britain. By the time of its commitment it consisted of three infantry brigades: the 4th, 6th and 13th.McKenzie-Smith (2018), pp. 2,036‚Äì2,037 On 5 September, a party of 105 personnel from the 5th Division, 2/8th Commando Squadron, New Guinea Force and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) was landed at Jacquinot Bay from the corvette .Gill (1968), p. 491 Assisted by AIB personnel, they investigated the area for two days while Kiama surveyed the bay. It was concluded that the region was suitable for a base as the bay could accommodate up to six liberty ships in all weather, a wharf capable of handling these vessels could be constructed relatively easily, room was available ashore to accommodate the 5th Division's base installations and combat formations, and an airstrip could be built nearby.Long (1963), pp. 245, 248‚Äì2495th Division (1945), pp. 16‚Äì17 M Special Unit also reported that no Japanese personnel remained in the Jacquinot Bay area.Mallett (2007), p. 287 The party which visited the Talasea‚ÄìHoskins area (already housing an American base) made a less favourable report. In particular, the report noted that the area lacked anchorages which were fully protected from the weather and it would not be possible to build a wharf capable of accommodating Liberty ships at either Talasea or Hoskins.5th Division (1945), p. 17 On 15 September, the commander of the Australian Army's combat forces, General Thomas Blamey, approved a proposal to establish a base at Jacquinot Bay. He also agreed for two battalions of the 6th Brigade to be landed at Jacquinot Bay, with the formation's third battalion being sent to Talasea‚ÄìHoskins. At this time the 6th Brigade ‚Äì consisting of the 19th, 36th and 14th/32nd Battalions ‚Äì was led by Brigadier Raymond Sandover. A Militia formation, it had not previously seen combat as a whole, though one of its infantry battalions (the 36th) had fought in the Battle of Buna‚ÄìGona during late 1942 and early 1943. Nevertheless, Sandover and his three battalion commanders ‚Äì Lieutenant Colonels Lindsay Miell (19th), Oscar Isaachsen (36th), and William Caldwell (14th/32nd) ‚Äì were all Australian Imperial Force veterans who had taken part in the fighting against the Germans and Italians in North Africa and Greece, and the Vichy French in Syria during 1941 and 1942.Long (1963), p. 249 The 36th Battalion was dispatched to Cape Hoskins from Lae, in early October, and relieved a battalion of the US 185th Infantry Regiment. The RAAF conducted three attacks on Rabaul as part of the preparations for the landing at Jacquinot Bay. On the night of 26 October a force of 18 Bristol Beaufort light bombers drawn from Nos. 6, 8 and 100 Squadrons attacked Japanese stores dumps and anti-aircraft positions at Rabaul. The results of this mission were unclear. The next raid by the three squadrons was conducted against stores dumps to the north of Rabaul on the evening of 27 October, with most of the bombs dropped landing in the target area. The third raid took place on 29 October, and involved 20 Beauforts from the three squadrons striking stores dumps to the west of Rabaul.Odgers (1968), p. 330 Landing alt=Black and white photo of three men wearing military uniforms and carrying guns and bags wading through water in front of a boat While AIB patrols continued to report that no Japanese troops were located in the Jacquinot Bay area, the Australian command decided that the landing there would be made by a combat-ready force protected by naval vessels. This was intended both as a precaution against a sudden Japanese offensive and to provide useful experience for the units involved. The landing was designated Operation Battleaxe.Gill (1968), p. 492 The 14th/32nd Battalion Group was assigned as the initial landing force. The battalion had been raised in the state of Victoria during 1942, and was still mainly made up of Victorian soldiers. It was supplemented by B Company of the 1st New Guinea Infantry Battalion (1 NGIB).McKenzie-Smith (2018), p. 2,267 An advance party from the 5th Base Sub Area was also deployed. The Australian troops embarked on the transport Cape Alexander at Lae on 2 November.14th/32nd Infantry Battalion (1944), p. 104 The transport sailed that afternoon under the escort of three Royal Australian Navy (RAN) warships: the destroyer , the frigate and sloop . The New Guinean soldiers were allocated to the former ferry Frances Peat, which was escorted from Lae to Jacquinot Bay by RAN motor launch . In addition to the ships which departed from Lae, another convoy of small craft proceeded to Jacquinot Bay from Arawe. This force comprised B Company of the US Army's 594th Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment, the tugboat and which served as an escort. The American unit operated 14 Landing Craft Mechanized (LCMs) and 9 Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel (LCVPs). Tancred was towing a workshop barge.Mallett 2007, pp. 22, 288 & 2905th Division (1945), p. 22 Elements of the RAAF were also available to support the landing. The plan for the operation specified that, if required, No. 6 Squadron, reinforced with Beauforts from Nos. 8 and 100 Squadrons, would attack the landing area before 6 am on 4 November. An additional two Beauforts could also observe for any bombardments made by the warships.Odgers (1968), p. 329 Prior to the landing, the air strike was cancelled by the RAAF officer who was attached to the landing force to coordinate air support as no opposition was expected. Cape Alexander and her escorts arrived at Jacquinot Bay at 6:35 am on 4 November, and were joined by the other Allied vessels shortly thereafter. While the voyage from Lae had been uneventful, the 14th/32nd Battalion's war diary records that the unit's accommodation on board the transport had been \\"very poor\\" as it was \\"very cramped, dirty and wet\\" and sanitary facilities were greatly insufficient. The landing of the 14th/32nd Battalion commenced at 9:30 am, with A Company making up the first wave. All elements of the battalion were ashore by 11:30 am.14th/32nd Infantry Battalion (1944), p. 105 No opposition was encountered, and the 14th/32nd Battalion began to establish defensive and living positions. In addition, personnel from the battalion were detailed to unload stores. Patrols were also sent out towards Wunung and Palmal, while a reconnaissance party from headquarters 5th Division was sent to the mission at Mal Mal.5th Division (1944), p. 17 Sandover regarded the lack of opposition as fortunate, as the landing craft which were to carry the soldiers from the ships to the shore arrived late and he perceived that the RAAF had failed to provide adequate support. However, he was pleased with his brigade's performance during operations in New Britain up to that time, and expressed pleasure at having \\"nearly reached the war\\".Long (1963), p. 250 Soldiers from the 1st New Guinea Infantry Battalion disembarking the landing craft which carried them to the northern shore of Jacquinot Bay on 6 November 1944 The following day, bad weather affected further landing operations around the bay. The beach around Mal Mal was usable and the nearby road found to be suitable for jeeps; however, the beachhead around Wunung was found to be unsatisfactory. Operations ceased at Kamalgaman and the landing of the 1 NGIB troops around Pomio had to be delayed.5th Division (1944), p. 37 Despite the weather, the 180 man-strong advance party of the 5th Base Sub Area was landed on 5 November, and began work on establishing logistics facilities.Mallett (2007), p. 288 After covering the landing force for two days, Vendetta, Barcoo and Swan proceeded to Wide Bay and bombarded Japanese positions there before departing the New Britain area. The motor launches ML 802 and ML 827 remained at Jacquinot Bay and conducted patrols along the south coast of the island in search of Japanese barges. ML 827 ran aground during a patrol on 17 November, and sank three days later while under tow to an Allied base. All of her crew survived.Gill (1968), p. 493 A Japanese air raid was conducted against Jacquinot Bay on 23 November. In the days after the landing, ground forces secured the Jacquinot Bay area. AIB personnel manned an outpost to warn of approaching Japanese forces, while the combat troops patrolled and established positions near the main landing area. On 6 November, the company from 1 NGIB was moved by landing craft to the northern shore of Jacquinot Bay, at Pomio, after the jetty there was rebuilt.5th Division (1944), p. 47 They subsequently guarded tracks leading to this area. The unit later relieved the AIB of responsibility for maintaining some of its positions to the east of Jacquinot Bay. The 14th/32nd Battalion remained near the landing area; though, between 8 and 12 November, one of its companies gradually established an outpost.5th Division (1945), p. 35 Aftermath=Base construction A power shovel operated by the 2/3rd Railway Construction Company unloading gravel to be used for road building in the Jacquinot Bay area into a truck Rudimentary base construction began as soon as the advance party of the base sub area arrived on 5 November. Bulldozers were used to clear the ground for tents to be set up for support personnel, and tracks were established around the site. The unloading of stores was hampered by rain, which began to fall shortly after the landing and continued throughout the first week. Initially, stores were offloaded onto the beach and then carried by hand further ashore. A pontoon jetty with rollers was constructed. By the time the remainder of the 5th Base Sub Area arrived on 11 and 12 November, of stores and equipment had been unloaded. These troops arrived aboard the transports J. Sterling Moreton and Swartenhondt, with a party of 670 native labourers. Major base construction works began on the second week after the landing. Kitchens, messes, a bakery, a sawmill, recreational facilities, latrines and other buildings were then established, although the completion of some buildings was delayed by shortages of engineer stores. The 2/3rd Railway Construction Company landed on 21 November, and worked on building roads. By 24 November, the road along the beach and several minor roads had been completed but use of these was restricted to dry periods. The headquarters of the 5th Division opened at Jacquinot Bay on 27 November.Mallett (2007), p. 289 Assisted by a period of good weather, work on major facilities at Jacquinot Bay began in December. These included: a large dock, an airstrip, stores depots and buildings to be used by 2/8th General Hospital. Sufficient stores were to be stockpiled to support 13,000 soldiers for 60 days. After ten days of dry weather in January 1945, the water reservoirs at Jacquinot Bay ran dry. Wells were dug but the water found was not potable. Water restrictions were imposed, and LCMs shipped water to Jacquinot Bay for three days.Mallett (2007), p. 290 The airstrip was completed in May 1945.Bradley (2012), p. 408 Originally, No. 79 Wing RAAF was to operate from Jacquinot Bay but it was reassigned to support Australian operations in Borneo. It was replaced by units of the Royal New Zealand Air Force. Two squadrons of Corsair fighter aircraft, a squadron operating Ventura maritime patrol aircraft and several support units were based at Jacquinot Bay from May 1945 until after the end of the war.Ross (1955), p. 309 The 6th Brigade (less the 36th Battalion deployed at Cape Hoskins), was gradually brought into the Jacquinot Bay area, with its final elements arriving on 16 December 1944.Long (1963), p. 252 Due to shipping shortages and the low priority given to building up forces on New Britain, it was not until April 1945 that all elements of the 5th Division had been brought forward to Jacquinot Bay, with the remaining combat elements (the 4th and 13th Brigades, the 2/14th Field Regiment and the 2/2nd Commando Squadron) deploying from Darwin, Lae and Madang throughout this period.Long (1963), p. 251 The company from the 594th Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment remained at Jacquinot Bay and was solely responsible for port operations until the 41st Australian Landing Craft Company arrived on 15 February 1945, deploying from Cairns. The 41st was equipped with smaller, less robust craft than the US unit, but further development of the port facilities to accommodate a wharf for unloading Liberty ships, and continuing improvement of the roads and bridges ashore, allowed the US company and its LCMs to be withdrawn by mid-April 1945.Mallett 2007, p. 292 Subsequent operations As Allied intelligence regarding the Japanese was still uncertain ‚Äì with information being at times either incomplete, conflicting, or even incorrect ‚Äì Ramsay, who officially assumed command of the forces on New Britain on 27 November, adopted a cautious approach. Jacquinot Bay was built up as a base of operations and the Australians began sending out patrols to fight for information and harass the Japanese, with limited advances taking place on both the northern and southern coasts of the island, pushing east towards the Japanese strong hold around the Gazelle Peninsula. The AIB, with a base at Jacquinot Bay, also continued to operate behind Japanese lines and passed information to the 5th Division.Powell (1996), p. 251 The Japanese lacked information on the movements of Allied forces in New Britain, and only learned of the change in command from Australian radio broadcasts.Charlton (1983), p. 95 They subsequently maintained a largely defensive posture, focusing upon maintaining the garrison around Rabaul.Grant (2016), p. 226 Australian official historian Gavin Long wrote that it was unclear why the Japanese stance on New Britain was so passive when the Australian offensive on Bougainville was strongly resisted.Long (1963), p. 269 Although few Japanese troops contested the Australian advance, it was hampered by shortages of shipping and aircraft. As a result, operations were limited to brigade-strength only. Until the airstrip was completed, air support was provided by aircraft based in New Guinea, meaning that there was a delay of around a day for support requests. There was also a shortage of light and reconnaissance aircraft. In January 1945, the 36th Battalion was dispatched from Cape Hoskins to Ea Ea on the north coast of New Britain by barge, and began sending out company-sized patrols. They subsequently reached Watu Point, in Open Bay, at the base of the Gazelle Peninsula by April. Relief of the 36th Battalion was delayed by a shortage of shipping.Long (1963), p. 260 Its replacement, the 37th/52nd Battalion, had to march overland rather than move by sea. The Australian forces also advanced along the south coast of the island, and began securing the Waitavalo‚ÄìTol area (Henry Reid Bay) in late February. Engineer support enabled crossing of the Wulwut River. Several clashes followed around Mount Sugi as the Australians fought to gain control of heavily defended ridges overlooking Henry Reid Bay. Rain and flooding hampered their efforts. By April, the Australians had secured Wide Bay and effectively hemmed the Japanese into the Gazelle Peninsula and contain them for the remainder of the campaign. This enabled the Allies to focus their attention elsewhere, such as Borneo.

Rakai Pikatan was also called Mpu Manuku. The monarch of the Medang Kingdom before Rakai Pikatan was Samaratungga of the Sailendra Dynasty. He had one son, Balaputra, and one daughter, Pramodhawardhani. Rakai Pikatan and the Sanjaya dynasty were Shivaite Hindus and is recorded in the Wantil Inscription as having married a daughter of another religion. This is most likely Pramodhawardhani, the Mahayana Buddhist daughter of Samaratungga. It's believed that Pikatan fought his brother in law Balaputra, forcing him to move to Srivijaya in 856. Other interpretations based on the Kayumwungan inscription put Balaputra as Pramodhawardhani's uncle rather than her brother as inscriptions only list Pramodhawaradhani as a child of Samaratungga. Hence, Balaputra went to Srivijaya not because of force but because he had no claim as a brother of the monarch. According to the interpretation of Loro Jonggrang legend, Pramodhawardhani's likeness was the model for Durga's image in the Prambanan temple.

Fullerton was once an industrial community (1907-1927), having developed around a large lumber mill. In 1986, the community and mill were added to the National Register of Historic Places as Fullerton Mill and Town because of their role in industry and in the development of housing for the mill workers. with four photos and two maps Conflict of name In addition to its current name, the community was believed to have been known as \\"Russville\\" at a point. The official usage has been \\"Fullerton\\" since 1975, when the Board on Geographic Names ruled against the usage of \\"Russville.\\" Although the reasoning behind the attempted name change is unclear, there is evidence that the name Russville was used on a map.[Louisiana Geological Survey. Geological Map of Vernon Parish. Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 1941] -The name Russville The term \\"official\\" usage comes about because of the ruling but the mill and community known as \\"Fullerton\\" has been the common name since the beginning. The name \\"Russville\\" possibly came about because of an error. History=The sawmill Fullerton mill opened in 1907 by Gulf Lumber Company, with headquarters in Missouri and owned by Samuel Holmes Fullerton, was ahead of its time especially for a sawmill. Built entirely of steel, iron, and concrete with no combustible materials Samuel invested 3.5 million dollars to build the mill. On a 10-hour shift the mill produced 400,000 board feet. A 50,000 gallon water storage tank provided water for the mill with a 1000-gallon per minute fire pump. There were 25 planners and 12 dry-kilns capable of processing 400,000 board feet. The loading dock was protected by a roof and was built so that thirty rail cars could be loaded at one time. A trolley system was in place so a loaded rail car could be transported to different location in the mill according to need. It is estimated that the mill cut 2.25 billion board feet consuming 4.2 million trees in the 20 years of operation. The community 400 houses were built for white workers of from five to seven rooms that included running water to every house and a bathroom and toilet. There were 144 cottages for the \\"colored workers\\" and all the houses had electricity. The layout of the community was well planned with streets and avenues. There was a two-story hospital, a 45-room two-story hotel, and a church that seated 1000. There was also a school, commissary, department store, drug store, meat market, cold storage room, barber shop, billiard hall, and post office. Turpentine still There was a turpentine still that was part of the Fullerton mill, but situated approximately two miles south, and a supporting community in between that included 129 cottages, a commissary, church, school (that provided an education to both communities), meat market, and a building that provided cold drinks and ice cream. There was also a train depot. This community was known as Rustville. The turpentine still and community was named after Paul D. Rust, the secretary of Gulf Lumber Company, from Boston. -Vernon Parish; GULF LUMBER COMPANY OF FULLERTON, LOUISIANA -by historian W. T. Block- excerpts from the Beaumont Enterprise, 1907- retrieved 22 August 2010 Alcohol The Fullerton mill also produced drinking alcohol from wood chips and sawdust. In 2019 Japanese researchers \\"invented\\" a way to make potable wood grain drinking alcohol. End of an era The final log, that had been saved for twenty years for the occasion, was cut on Friday, May 6, 1927. The final whistle blew signaling the end of an era as well as the demise of a mighty sawmill and community.

The game was set in a fictional sports bar named \\"Sports on Tap\\". Sportscaster Tom Green (no relation to the comic actor) was behind the counter as the \\"Bartender\\" (aka Emcee), with Shelly Gray appearing as the bar‚Äôs \\"Waitress\\" (aka Hostess). There was no music or real announcer for the show. However, at the beginning and end of the show, as well as before commercial breaks, Johnny Gilbert was heard doing play-by-play was played as if from a radio or television. Also appearing on camera was Tony Pandolfo, who called out the names of the contestants and acted as a judge during the game. Game Play Four players, seated at the counter of the bar, competed against each other. Round one Each player was staked to $50 and played one player at a time. The first player in control was shown the first halves of two questions on the bar‚Äôs TV monitor (similar to questions on Your Number's Up). The player selected one of the half-questions for Greene to finish. Three half-questions (four on Monday-Thursday during tournament weeks) are played per player in the round. On the first two half-questions (three during the tournament), a correct answer earned $50 with no penalty for an incorrect answer. In either case, a new half-question would replace the chosen one except for the third half-question. At that point, the player would then wager any or all of their score on the remaining half-question. A correct answer added the wager and an incorrect answer subtracted the wager. The three remaining players would play in a similar fashion. Rounds Two and Three All four players now competed on a toss-up basis with the player who gave the last correct answer selecting the half-questions. If a player buzzes in with a correct answer, that player would then have a chance at a ‚ÄúDouble Play‚Äù by selecting another half-question to answer on their own. However, a wrong answer deducted the amount from that player. Each correct answer was worth $50 in Round Two and $100 in Round Three. Final round All four players would line up on the stairs in the back of the bar in order of their scores after Round Three. The players would now play a head-to-head \\"stepladder final\\" playoff to determine the day‚Äôs winner. The fourth place player would play the third place player, with the higher scoring player selecting all the half- questions. Once a half-question has been chosen, the other half-question is removed from the game and two new half-questions appear on the TV monitor. Each correct answer was now worth one point. The first player to reach three points wins the round and moves up to the next step to face the second place player. The winner of that playoff then moves up to face the first place player. The winner of the final playoff is declared the winner of the day and adds their name to a \\"Winner‚Äôs Board\\" keeping track of all the winners for that week. Friday Final The winners of all four games of the week would then compete in one final game on Friday for the combined total of all four player‚Äôs winnings. Tournament The weekly winners would then advance to a season-ending Tournament of Champions where the grand champion wins a $50,000 cash bonus in the first season and $25,000 in the second season. During the first three days of the week, three semifinalists (two Friday winners and one of the top-scoring runners-up) competed per day. The loser of the final match of the Playoff Round returned for Thursday's wildcard match. The Friday final pitted all four winners from earlier in the week for the cash prize. The Friday final would be played exactly like a regular episode.

The congregation played an important role in accommodating Melbourne's large population of Jewish Holocaust survivors following World War II. Overview The congregation was formed around 1931 or 1932 as a prayer service in a private home. In 1938 the congregation moved to 40 Mitford Street where a part-time Talmud Torah was established in addition to regular prayer services. Prior to World War II the congregation grew with the arrival of Jewish European immigrants. In 1939-40 several members broke away and formed their own congregation, later known as the Adass Israel Congregation. Elwood Shule flourished during and especially following World War II, as a large number of Jewish Holocaust survivors settled in the area. Services took place in halls in Acland Street, St Kilda, and Hennessy Avenue, Elwood during peak periods, before larger premises were acquired at 26 Avoca Avenue in 1942. The synagogue's current site, at 39 Dickens Street, was purchased in the early 1950s by synagogue President Abe Sicree. A new synagogue building was constructed and dedicated at the site in 1957, in time for the High Holidays of that year. The following year Rabbi Chaim Gutnick was appointed Chief Minister of the synagogue, a position he held for some forty-five years until his retirement in 2003. A new school campus was constructed on synagogue premises by Moriah College of Elwood in the early 1960s. Following Moriah College's demise the campus was occupied by Mt Scopus Memorial College and later Yesodei HaTorah College. In 1973 the synagogue building was renovated and expanded to a seating capacity of 1068. In 2003 Rabbi Mordechai Gutnick succeeded his father Chaim as Chief Minister of the congregation. In 2008 the Elwood Talmud Torah Hebrew Congregation celebrated its 75th anniversary. Federal member for Melbourne Ports Michael Danby, an Elwood resident, marked the occasion by paying tribute to the congregation in a speech before Australian Parliament on 16 October 2008, saying, > \\"It is very fortuitous, when viewed in retrospect, that this congregation > was formed by central and east European migrants prior to the Second World > War. These were the very people who were able to look after the refugees and > the displaced persons who came off the ships after the Second World War and > who, subsequently, filled the pews at this very special Shule.\\" A similar tribute was delivered before Victorian Parliament by Martin Foley.

He was selected as an All-Western football player while playing for Lake Forest University in 1909 and went on to a coaching career at Kalamazoo College (1911‚Äì1916), Lake Forest (1916‚Äì1918), and the University of Michigan (1919‚Äì1928). Early life and playing career Mather was born in Ottumwa, Iowa and played three sports at Ottumwa High School. He enrolled at Lake Forest University, where he played at the end position on the school's football team. In 1909, he was captain of the Lake Forest football team and was selected as an all-Western end by the Chicago Daily News. In selecting him for its All-Illinois football team that same year, the Chicago Record-Herald wrote: \\"Mather, by virtue of his glittering achievements in 1908, had little trouble in clinching a place on the all-state combine. With another season in which to perfect the forward pass and the open style of play Mather developed into a terror on offense. As a defensive player he is rated among the headliners throughout Illinois. His forte is left end. The game with DePauw Thanksgiving day marked the windup of Mather's college career.\\" He was also captain of the Lake Forest basketball team in his senior year. Coaching career=Kalamazoo In 1911, Mather was hired as the coach of all sports at Kalamazoo College, where he remained until 1916. He was the head football coach for five seasons, from 1911 until 1915, compiling a record of 13‚Äì12. Mather's basketball teams at Kalamazoo won all of their home games four times and went undefeated in the 1914‚Äì15 season. The teams also won the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association titles in four of Mather's five years as the coach. Mather's Kalamazoo College basketball teams had a combined record of 29‚Äì13. Arkansas With the entry of the United States into World War I, Mather entered the United States Army. In March 1919, after being discharged from the Army, Mather took over as director and coach of athletics at the University of Arkansas. In April 1919, Mather was reported to be organizing teams in basketball, tennis, volleyball, and track at the Fayetteville, Arkansas campus. Michigan In the fall of 1919, Mather was hired by the University of Michigan. He was the head basketball coach at Michigan from 1919 to 1928 and coached the team to three Big Ten Conference titles and an overall record of 108‚Äì53 in his nine seasons as coach. He led the team to an 18‚Äì4 overall record (8‚Äì4 in conference) during the 1920‚Äì21 season. The 1921 team won its first eight and last eight games to tie the Wisconsin Badgers and Purdue Boilermakers for the Big Ten title. The team won back-to-back championships in 1925‚Äì26 and 1926‚Äì27. The 1926 squad, which was captained by Richard Doyle who became the team's first All-American, tied with Purdue, the Iowa Hawkeyes and Indiana Hoosiers for the conference championship. The 1927 team had a new All-American, Bennie Oosterbaan, and won the school's first back-to-back championships and first outright championship with a 14‚Äì3 overall (10‚Äì2, Big Ten) record. Mather was also an assistant football coach at Michigan for nine seasons, from 1919 to 1927. Sickness and death A few weeks after the Wolverines won the Big Ten championship for the 1926‚Äì27 season, Mather underwent surgery for cancer. Mather never fully recovered from the operation. In the fall of 1927, he was put in charge of Michigan's freshman football team, and he returned as basketball coach at the beginning of the 1927‚Äì28 season. However, Mather was forced to step down from his coaching duties on advice from his doctor. While he visited the team for practices, the 1927‚Äì28 basketball team was coached by Michigan's athletic director, Fielding H. Yost. A telephone line was installed at Mather's bedside, and football coach Harry Kipke relayed the plays to him and gave him a summary at the end of each game. Mather died of cancer after a long illness in August 1928. He was age 41 at the time of his death and was survived by his wife and two small sons.

Two Hindi films produced, directed, written, acted and distributed by him were \\"Super Hits\\" ‚Äì Bindiya Aur BandookCine Blitz, Volume 24, Issue 2 \\"It was a runaway hit but a B grade film\\" and Ranga Khush. (In Indian cinema any film which runs for over 50 weeks continuously is classified as a \\"Super Hit.\\") He successfully instituted a plagiarism suit against the producers of one of India's greatest films, Sholay, for substantially copying his work. The character Ranga Khush was a household name in India in the 1970s, especially among little children who copied his maniacal laugh and rolling eyeballs, and favourably compares with Gabbar Singh who copied him. The film Ranga Khush was a spinoff from Joginder's two-word dialogue in Bindiya aur Bandook (known internationally as \\"The girl with the gun\\").  Career  Joginder was often placed on lists of \\"worst movie directors\\", a fan-generated title he shared with Ed Wood. In common with Wood, Joginder made a run of cheap and poorly produced films, now humorously celebrated for their unsophisticated special effects, large amounts of ill-fitting stock footage, idiosyncratic dialogue, eccentric casts and outlandish plot elements, although his flair for showmanship gave his projects at least a modicum of commercial success. His commercial acumen came to the fore when he dared to release his houseful sequel Bindiya aur Bandook-2 against J.P. Dutta's megabudget LOC which flopped. The popular song \\"Main Hoon Botal Band Sharab\\" had audiences dancing in the aisles whenever it came on the screen. Joginder acknowledged that he had no plans to enter mainstream cinema. His \\"Jhuggie-Jhopdi\\" (slum) audiences gave him fame and success. Joginder's film Ranga Khush was repeatedly featured in debates in India's upper house of Parliament, the Rajya Sabha, for its extended rape sequences and insults to religious deities of all faiths.Parliamentary debates, Volume 97, 1976 by Rajya Sabha Like Aamir Khan and Guru Dutt, he was often shy in claiming directorial credit for his hit films which were usually attributed to industry veteran Shibu Mitra.

It was formed in September 1942 by the amalgamation of the 14th and 32nd Battalions and was assigned to the 6th Brigade, 4th Division in Geraldton, Western Australia. The battalion served firstly in Australia and then later New Guinea, being employed mainly on garrison duties, before being transferred to the 5th Division and deployed to New Britain late in the war where it took part briefly in the Australian containment campaign on that island. In April 1945 it returned to Australia for rest and re-organisation and was disbanded later that year without seeing further combat. History=Formation By mid-1942, an over mobilisation of Australia's military forces resulted in a manpower shortage in the Australian economy. In order to rectify this situation, the Australian government decided to amalgamate and disband a number of units from the Militia in order to free up their personnel and return them to the civilian workforce.. As a result, on 12 October 1942, the 14th and 32nd Battalions, which had been undertaking garrison duties around Geraldton, Western Australia, were amalgamated to form the 14th/32nd Battalion... Upon formation the battalion adopted the territorial title of the \\"Prahran/Footscray Regiment\\" and was assigned to the 6th Brigade, 4th Division. The battalion's personnel were drawn predominately from the 14th Battalion, although 164 officers and men from the 32nd who had volunteered to serve under the same conditions of the Second Australian Imperial Force, were transferred to the 14th/32nd at this time. As more than 65 per cent of the battalion's 996 personnel volunteered for overseas service, the battalion was designated as an Australian Imperial Force battalion, meaning that it could be sent outside the territorial limits imposed by the Defence Act (1903).. New Guinea and New Britain After this, the 14th/32nd Battalion was moved to the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland, to undertake amphibious landing and jungle warfare training in preparation for deployment overseas. In July 1943, they were sent to Port Moresby, New Guinea, where they once again filled the role of garrison troops for almost a year, operating between Buna, Gona and Nassau Bay. In 1944, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William Caldwell, who had previously commanded at company-level in Greece and the Middle East,. the battalion was attached to the 5th Division and on 4 November the 14th/32nd Battalion, forming the vanguard of the 6th Brigade, carried out an amphibious landing at Jacquinot Bay on New Britain. Soldiers from the 14th/32nd Battalion disembarking from a US Army landing craft during the landing at Jacquinot Bay on 4 November 1944 Although opposition to the landing was expected, the 14th/32nd Battalion arrived on the beach and found that the Japanese defenders had withdrawn further down the coast... This allowed the battalion to concentrate on the task of establishing a beachhead and unloading stores. This task was made more difficult though by a torrential downpour on 6 November, nevertheless they were eventually able to establish themselves around Pal Mal Mal Plantation and patrols were sent out to locate the Japanese.. By 10 November, patrols reached the Esis River and after contacting locals it was found that the Japanese were withdrawing towards the Gazelle Peninsula, where it was estimated that about 93,000 Japanese were stationed... Due to the size of the Japanese garrison, as the rest of the 5th Division began to arrive on the island, it was decided that the Australians would undertake a campaign of containment rather than engage in offensive operations. As a part of this campaign, the 14th/32nd Battalion was assigned the task of advancing along the coast from Jacquinot Bay to Henry Reid Bay. With no roads and only narrow tracks, the going was difficult and in order to improve mobility the battalion used barges to carry out a series of landings as they advanced through Sampun and Lampun, passing around Wide Bay, before reaching Kalai Plantation in mid- February 1945.. At Kalai the battalion moved into the Kamandran Mission where they received intelligence reports of a force of about 200 Japanese occupying a position at Gogbulo creek. Fighting patrols were sent out, but no contact was made, although evidence of occupation was found indicating that the Japanese were moving back to a defensive position to the north of Mavelo river.. Before they could launch an assault, however, the battalion was relieved by the 19th Battalion and on 28 February the 19th crossed the Mavelo. Following this the Japanese withdrew back towards the mountains around the Waitavalo and Tol Plantations,. and in early March an attempt was made to force a crossing on the Wulwut river. After initially being turned back by intense Japanese mortar and machine-gun fire, the 19th made a successful second attempt,. forcing the Japanese back further towards Mount Sugi and Bacon Hill.. alt=Soldiers wearing slouch hats and carrying rifles march past huts in a jungle clearing As orders were passed for an attack to be made on this position, the 14th/32nd was brought up to relieve the 19th.. The Japanese position sat atop a hill which rose steeply, up to 45 degrees in some places, from the jungle below.. In preparation, the 14th/32nd occupied a number of positions around Bacon Hill and at 9:55 am on 16 March 1945 the attack began with two companies, 'B' and 'D', attacking under the cover of an intense artillery barrage provided by elements of the 2/14th Field Regiment, with direct fire support being provided by 'A' and 'C' Companies from the high ground surrounding the hill. The Japanese defences were well-prepared though, and machine-gun and mortar fire from well-sited positions soon pinned down two platoons from 'B' Company.. In order to regain momentum, a flanking move to the left was undertaken by 'D' Company, but after two hours they too came under intense machine-gun fire as they attempted to round Mount Sugi and attack the Japanese from the rear, forcing them to dig-in to the north of Bacon Hill.. At this point the situation became quite desperate for the attackers, and a number of Australian platoons found themselves embroiled in an intense battle. Finally, late in the day, after having lost 10 men killed and another 13 wounded the attack was called off.. The attack was resumed early the following day with two companies attacking from the north and digging-in on the eastern approaches to the hill while two platoons clambered up the steep western slope amidst heavy Japanese mortar and grenade attacks. By nightfall the Australians, who had lost a further six men killed and 17 wounded, were in control of most of the position, although two Japanese positions were still holding out. On 18 March the attack was resumed and finally, by 3:00 pm, the last Japanese had been cleared from the hill... Following the battle, the battalion continued patrolling operations beyond the Waitavalo‚ÄìTol area but no further contact was made. On 21 March when they were relieved once more by the 19th Battalion. A week later, on 28 March, the 13th Brigade began to relieve the units of the 6th Brigade, and over the following fortnight the transition took place.. On 12 April the battalion returned to Kalai where they received the news that they were being returned to Australian for rest and re-organisation in preparation for further operations. On 7 May 1945 they embarked upon the troopship Duntroon, arriving in Brisbane a week later.. Disbandment With the war seen to be coming to a close, the Army decided to disband the 6th Brigade and its component units, and as a result, the 14th/32nd was disbanded on 21 July 1945, while at Loganlea.. During the war the battalion lost 31 men killed or died on active service and a further 46 wounded. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: one Distinguished Service Order, one Order of the British Empire, one British Empire Medal, two Military Crosses, one Distinguished Conduct Medal, one Military Medal, and seven Mention in Dispatches. Battle honours For their service during the Second World War, the 14th/32nd Battalion received the following battle honours: * South-West Pacific 1942‚Äì45 and Waitavolo.

It is the second film in the Avatar franchise, following Avatar (2009). Cameron is producing the film with Jon Landau, with Josh Friedman originally announced as his co-writer; it was later announced that Cameron, Friedman, Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, and Shane Salerno took a part in the writing process of all sequels before being attributed separate scripts, making the eventual writing credits unclear. Cast members Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Giovanni Ribisi, Joel David Moore, Dileep Rao, CCH Pounder, and Matt Gerald are all reprising their roles from the original film, with Sigourney Weaver returning in a different role. New cast members include Kate Winslet, Cliff Curtis, Edie Falco, Brendan Cowell, Michelle Yeoh, Jemaine Clement, Oona Chaplin, CJ Jones, and Vin Diesel. Cameron, who had stated in 2006 that he would like to make sequels to Avatar if it was successful, announced the first two in 2010 following the widespread success of the first film, with Avatar 2 aiming for a 2014 release. However, the subsequent addition of three more sequels, and the necessity to develop new technology in order to film performance capture scenes underwater, a feat never accomplished before, led to significant delays to allow the crew more time to work on the writing, pre-production, and visual effects. The film has been subject to 8 delays to its theatrical release, with the latest occurring on July 23, 2020; it is currently planned for a release on December 16, 2022, with the following three sequels to be released, respectively, on December 20, 2024, December 18, 2026 and December 22, 2028. Preliminary shooting for the film started in Manhattan Beach, California on August 15, 2017, followed by principal photography simultaneously with Avatar 3 in New Zealand on September 25, 2017; filming concluded in late September 2020, after over three years of shooting. Premise 13 years after the events of the original film, Jake Sully and Neytiri have formed a family and are doing anything to stay together. They are, however, forced to leave their home and explore the different regions of Pandora when an old threat returns to finish what it started. Cast Na'vi * Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former human who fell in love with Neytiri and befriended the Na'vi after becoming a part of the Avatar Program, eventually taking their side in their conflict with humans and leading them to victory; at the end of the first film, he becomes the new leader of the Omaticaya (the Na'vi clan central to the story) alongside Mo'at and transfers his mind into his avatar permanently. * Zoe Saldana as Neytiri, daughter to the previous clan chief, future Tsah√¨k of the clan, and mate to Jake Sully. * CCH Pounder as Mo'at, the Omaticaya's spiritual leader and Neytiri's mother. * Cliff Curtis as Tonowari, the leader of the reef people clan of Metkayina. * Jamie Flatters as Neteyam, Jake and Neytiri's first son and oldest child. * Britain Dalton as Lo'ak, Jake and Neytiri's second son. * Trinity Bliss as Tuktirey (\\"Tuk\\"), Jake and Neytiri's eight-year-old daughter and their youngest child. * Bailey Bass as Tsireya (\\"Reya\\"), a graceful and strong free- diver of the Metkayina. * Filip Geljo as Aonung, a young male hunter and free- diver of the Metkayina. * Duane Evans Jr. as Rotxo, a young male hunter and free-diver of the Metkayina. * Kate Winslet as Ronal, a free-diver of the Metkayina. Winslet called Ronal \\"a pivotal character in the ongoing story\\", but also \\"relatively small comparative to the lengthy shoot\\", as shooting all her scenes would only take a month. It marks her first time working with performance capture, or motion capture altogether; she, like most of the child cast, also had to learn free-diving for the film, ultimately being able to hold her breath for seven minutes. Humans * Giovanni Ribisi as Parker Selfridge, the corporate administrator for the RDA mining operation in the first film. * Joel David Moore as Dr. Norm Spellman, a former part of the Avatar Program who chose to side with the Na'vi in the first film. * Dileep Rao as Dr. Max Patel, a scientist who worked in the Avatar Program and came to support Jake's rebellion against the RDA in the first film. * Matt Gerald as Corporal Lyle Wainfleet, a mercenary who fought for the RDA against the Na'vi in the first film. Despite the death of his character in the previous installment, Gerald was announced to reprise his role in August 2017. * Jack Champion as Javier \\"Spider\\" Socorro, a teenager born on Hell's Gate (the human base on Pandora in the first film) but who \\"prefers his time in the Pandoran rainforest\\". * Edie Falco as General Ardmore, the commander in charge of the RDA's interests. * Brendan Cowell as Captain Mick Scoresby, the head of a private sector marine hunting vessel on the planet of Pandora. * Michelle Yeoh as Dr. Karina Mogue * Jemaine Clement as Dr. Ian Garvin, a marine biologist Unknown * Sigourney Weaver: Weaver originally appeared in the first film as Dr. Grace Augustine, a human who takes the side of the Na'vi and dies during the conflict. Although both Weaver and Cameron confirmed that she would return in the sequels, she stated in 2014 that she would not play the same character. * Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch, who led the forces of the RDA, the human organization colonizing Pandora, in their conflict with the Na'vi in the first film. Although the character died at the end of Avatar, Cameron confirmed in 2010 that Lang would return in the first three sequels, stating, \\"I'm not going to say exactly how we're bringing him back, but it's a science fiction story, after all. His character will evolve into really unexpected places across the arc of our new three-film saga.\\" He later stated that Quaritch would act as the main antagonist once again, in all four sequels. Lang's role will involve motion capture. * Oona Chaplin as Varang, a \\"strong and vibrant central character who spans the entire saga of the sequels\\". Vin Diesel and CJ Jones have been cast in undisclosed roles. Production In 2006, Cameron stated that if Avatar was successful, he hoped to make two sequels to the film. In 2010, he said the film's widespread success confirmed that he would do so. The sequels were originally scheduled for release in and 2015. He included certain scenes in the first film for future story follow- ups. Cameron planned to shoot the sequels back-to-back and to begin work \\"once the novel is nailed down\\". He stated that the sequels would widen the universe while exploring other moons of Polyphemus. The first sequel would focus on the ocean of Pandora and also feature more of the rainforest. He intended to capture footage for this sequel at the bottom of the Mariana Trench using a deepwater submersible. In 2011, Cameron stated that he was just starting to design the ocean ecosystem of Pandora and the other worlds to be included in the story. The storyline, although continuing the environmental theme of the first film, would not be \\"strident\\" since the film will concentrate on entertainment. The sequels were confirmed as continuing to follow the characters of Jake and Neytiri in December 2009. Cameron implied that the humans would return as the antagonists of the story. In 2011, Cameron stated his intention to film the sequels at a higher frame rate than the industry standard 24 frames per second, in order to add a heightened sense of reality. In 2013, Cameron announced that the sequels would be filmed in New Zealand, with performance capture to take place in 2014. An agreement with the New Zealand government required at least one world premiere to be held in Wellington and at least NZ$500 million (approximately US$410 million at December 2013 exchange rates) to be spent on production activity in New Zealand, including live-action filming and visual effects. The New Zealand government announced it would raise its baseline tax rebate for filmmaking from 15% to 20%, with 25% available to international productions in some cases and 40% for New Zealand productions (as defined by section 18 of the New Zealand Film Commission Act 1978). In 2012, Cameron mentioned a possible third sequel for the first time; it was officially confirmed the following year. Cameron was then looking to release Avatar 2 in 2015, but later that year, production was rescheduled for 2014, with the film to be released in December 2016, and to be followed by the two other sequels in 2017 and 2018. By 2015, the scheduled release dates for the sequels were each delayed by another year, with the first sequel expected to be released in December 2017; this was due to the writing process, which Cameron called \\"a complex job\\". The following month, Fox announced a further release delay. As of February 2016, production of the sequels was scheduled to begin in April 2016 in New Zealand. In April 2016, Cameron announced at CinemaCon that there will be four Avatar sequels, all of which will be filmed simultaneously, with release dates in December 2018, 2020, 2022, and 2023, respectively. In late October 2016, it was reported that Cameron was going to push for \\"glasses-free 3D\\" with the sequels, but he later disagreed with these rumors and did not think the technology would be there yet. In March 2017, Cameron revealed that Avatar 2 would not be released in 2018, as originally believed. On April 27, 2017, the release dates for all four sequels were ultimately announced: December 18, 2020 for Avatar 2, December 17, 2021 for Avatar 3, December 20, 2024 for Avatar 4, and December 19, 2025 for Avatar 5. The films will be released in Dolby Vision. New crew members include cinematographer Russell Carpenter, who worked with Cameron on True Lies and Titanic, and Aashrita Kamath, who will act as art director on all four sequels. Kirk Krack, founder of Performance Freediving International, worked as a free-diving trainer for the cast and crew for the underwater scenes. Asked about the delays of the releases of the film and its sequels, Cameron stated: He was optimistic that the delays would not harm the films' success, comparing it to his films Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Aliens, which were both commercially successful sequels released seven years after the original films. Several creatures introduced in Avatar Flight of Passage will be featured in the film. In May 2019, it was reported that the Avatar sequels release dates had been pushed back as much as 2 years, thus the release of Avatar 2 had been pushed back to December 2021 while the three other Avatar sequels are due to be released respectively in December 2023, December 2025 and December 2027 as a result of the announcement of the three upcoming Star Wars films due to be released respectively on December 16, 2022, December 20, 2024 and December 18, 2026. In August 2020, the release was pushed back again to December 16, 2022. In total there have been 8 delays to the theatrical release. Writing In 2012, Cameron stated that the sequels were being written as \\"separate stories that have an overall arc inclusive of the first film\\", with the second having a clear conclusion instead of a cliffhanger to the next film. Screenwriters were also announced: Josh Friedman for the first, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver for the second, and Shane Salerno for the third. In April 2014, Cameron expected to finish the (then) three scripts within six weeks, stating that all three sequels would be in production simultaneously and were still slated for December 2016 to 2018 releases. He stated that although Friedman, Jaffa and Silver, and Salerno are each co-writing one sequel with him, they at first worked together on all three scripts: \\"I didn't assign each writer which film they were going to work on until the last day. I knew if I assigned them their scripts ahead of time, they'd tune out every time we were talking about the other movie.\\" Cameron added that they had \\"worked out every beat of the story across all three films so it all connects as one, sort of, three-film saga\\", a creative process that was inspired by his experiences in the writing room of his television series Dark Angel. The writing took longer than expected, forcing Cameron to delay the release of the films further in 2015. In December 2015, he stated that he was \\"in the process of doing another pass through all three scripts ... Just refining. That's in parallel with the design process. The design process is very mature at this point. We've been designing for about a year and a half. All the characters, settings and creatures are all pretty much [set].\\" On February 11, 2017, Cameron announced that the writing of all four sequels was complete. In a November 26 interview the same year, he estimated that the scripts had taken four years to write overall. Comparing the themes of the sequels to the original, Cameron stated that \\"It will be a natural extension of all the themes, and the characters, and the spiritual undercurrents. Basically, if you loved the first movie, you're gonna love these movies, and if you hated it, you're probably gonna hate these. If you loved it at the time, and you said later you hated it, you're probably gonna love these\\". He later compared the sequels to The Godfather franchise, calling it \\"a generational family saga [...] It's a continuation of the same characters and about what happens when warriors, willing to go on suicide charges and leap off cliffs on to the backs of big orange Toruks, grow up and have their own kids. Now the kids are the change makers. It's interesting.\\" Discussing the character of Tuk in a February 2019 interview, Cameron mentioned that she was eight years old, and that the film would feature a scene between Jake and Neytiri taking place from Tuk's perspective: \\"There's a three-page argument scene between Jake and Neytiri, a marital dispute, very, very critical to the storyline. I wound up shooting it all from the point of view of the 8-year-old hiding under the structure and peeking in. Having gone through the experience with [Sam Worthington] on Avatar, I now knew how to write the Jake character going forward across the emotional rollercoaster of the next four movies.\\" In a December 2019 interview, Lang stated that his character was always meant to return in the sequels, as Cameron had shared with him \\"that Quaritch had a future\\" while shooting the original film. Casting Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana were confirmed in January 2010 to have signed on to reprise their roles in the sequels. Later that year, Cameron confirmed that both Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang would return despite the demise of their characters. Cameron also stated that Weaver would be featured in all three sequels (the fourth one was not planned at the time) and that her character Grace Augustine would be alive. In March 2015, however, Weaver said that she will play a new character in the next film. In September 2015, Michelle Rodriguez stated that unlike Weaver and Lang, whose characters had also died in the first film, she would not return in Avatar 2. Several new cast announcements were made in 2017, with Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder and Matt Gerald all confirmed to return from the first film. Announced newcomers included Oona Chaplin, whose character, Varang, was described as \\"a strong and vibrant central character who spans the entire saga of the sequels\\", and Cliff Curtis as Tonowari, the leader of the Na'vi reef people clan of Metkayina. On September 23, 2017, child actor Filip Geljo was revealed to have been signed in an undisclosed role. On September 27, seven child actors were confirmed as a part of the main cast including Geljo: Jamie Flatters, Britain Dalton and Trinity Bliss as the children of Jake and Neytiri, Geljo, Bailey Bass, and Duane Evans Jr. as members of the Metkayina (together with Curtis), and Jack Champion, the only one to perform in live action, as a human born on Pandora. Cameron later stated that the child cast had been trained for six months to prepare for the underwater scenes filmed in performance capture, and that they now could all hold their breath \\"in the two- to four-minute range\\", even Trinity Bliss who was seven years old, and were now \\"all perfectly capable of acting underwater, very calmly while holding their breath\\". On October 3, 2017, it was reported that Kate Winslet, who starred in Cameron's Titanic (1997), had joined the cast of Avatar 2, and possibly its sequels. Cameron commented \\"Kate and I had been looking for something to do together for 20 years, since our collaboration on Titanic, which was one of the most rewarding of my career\\", and added that her character was named Ronal. Although the nature of her character was originally unknown, Cameron stated the following month that Ronal was \\"part of the Sea People, the reef people\\", in reference to the Na'vi clan of Metkayina, making Avatar 2 Winslet's first role via performance capture, or motion capture altogether, which she was looking forward to; as she insisted on performing all her character's movements herself, she, like the child cast, had to learn free-diving for the film. Winslet, who had been notoriously reluctant about working with Cameron again because of the complicated situations he puts his actors in for their scenes, stated that Cameron proposed the role to her in July 2017 when he came to help her and their fellow Titanic collaborator Leonardo DiCaprio at a fundraiser in France, sending her the scripts shortly after. She commented that her role was \\"relatively small comparative to the lengthy shoot\\", as she would only have one month of shootings, but also \\"a pivotal character in the ongoing story\\". On October 13, 2017, it was announced that Giovanni Ribisi would reprise his role of Parker Selfridge from the first film, in all four upcoming Avatar films. On January 25, 2018, Dileep Rao was confirmed to return as Dr. Max Patel. A year later, Edie Falco, Brendan Cowell, and Michelle Yeoh joined the cast in live-action roles. In early April 2019, Vin Diesel announced that he would be joining the cast of the Avatar sequel, although it was not clearly specified which sequels he would be in. In October 2019, Edward Norton revealed that had turned down a role in Avatar 2 due to only being interested in playing a Na'vi, which his proposed character was not. In April 2018, David Thewlis revealed his involvement in the franchise, stating that he would be featured in three of the four sequels, later stating in January 2020 that his character was a Na'vi. This led to Thewlis being largely reported as part of the cast of Avatar 2; however, he stated in June 2020 that the reports were wrong, and that he would actually be a part of Avatar 3 to 5.  Performance capture filming  Avatar 2 had entered production and started preliminary shooting on August 15, 2017, with Manhattan Beach, California as the main shooting location. Principal photography started on September 25, 2017, simultaneously with Avatar 3. As Sigourney Weaver later revealed in November, filming had to be moved around to allow her to film a cameo appearance in the series eight finale of Doc Martin. On November 23, Cameron stated that the crew had been undergoing tests with the cast for the last month to film underwater scenes in performance capture, and that they succeeded in filming the first of those on November 14, featuring six of their seven main child actors, including Trinity Bliss. He stated \\"we're getting really good data, beautiful character motion and great facial performance capture. We've basically cracked the code\\". He said that tests would last until January 2018, as \\"we're still working in our small test tank. We graduate to our big tank in January\\". It was \\"a dialogue scene\\", as according to Cameron, the characters communicate via \\"a kind of a sign language\\". On April 30, 2018, Kate Winslet had \\"just a couple days\\" of shooting left to do. In May 2018, Saldana stated that filming was \\"kind of only halfway done\\" and that the crew is \\"about [to finish] motion capture production on the [second and third] movies, and then after that, they go straight into pre-production for the live-action part that would shoot for six months in New Zealand.\\" Saldana finished shooting her scenes on June 8, for both Avatar 2 and its sequel, while Cameron stated around the same time that 130 days of performance capture had been shot. On November 14, 2018, Cameron announced filming with the principal performance capture cast had been completed.  Live-action filming  In February 2019, Landau stated that live-action filming for Avatar 2 and 3 would commence in New Zealand in the spring of 2019. Cameron confirmed later the same month that they had \\"only wrapped for [the motion capture parts]. Now, that is the vast majority of the characters and it is the vast majority of the running time of the film[s]. But that pesky little live action component is going to cost me five months of my life across the two movies.\\" Filming for 2019 concluded on November 29, to resume the following year in New Zealand. On March 17, 2020, Landau announced that the filming of the Avatar sequel films in New Zealand had been postponed indefinitely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. He also confirmed that production would remain in Los Angeles. However, virtual production continued in Manhattan Beach, California while visual effects continued at Weta Digital in Wellington. In early May, health and safety production protocols had been endorsed by the New Zealand government, allowing filming to resume in the country. On June 1, 2020, Landau posted a picture of himself and Cameron on Instagram, showing that they had returned to New Zealand to resume filming. After their arrival, Cameron and 55 other crew members who had traveled to New Zealand started a 2-week government-supervised isolation period at a hotel in Wellington before they would resume filming. This would make Avatar 2 and 3 the first major Hollywood blockbusters to resume production after postponing filming due to the pandemic. On June 16, 2020, Cameron resumed filming and Landau posted a photo of his crew on Instagram filming the production. In September 2020, Cameron confirmed that live action filming in New Zealand had been completed, therefore completing the shooting of the film altogether after over three years; he estimated Avatar 3 to be \\"95%\\" completed, due to having live-action parts yet to be filmed outside of New Zealand. Visual effects On July 31, 2017, it was announced that Weta Digital had commenced work on the Avatar sequels. The film will heavily feature underwater scenes, actually filmed underwater with the cast in performance capture. Blending underwater filming and performance capture being a feature never accomplished before, it took the team a year and a half to develop a new motion capture system, with Cameron stating: Landau stated in November 2015 that Avatar 2 would have a number of major technological improvements since the first movie. A lot more of the lighting work on the virtual production stage could be done during production instead of post-production, and like Alita: Battle Angel, which is produced and co- written by Cameron, the crew can use two lightweight HD head cams to record the actors' facial performance. In addition they also used two digital puppets instead of just one; one that is an accurate copy of the real actor, and another that is the actor's character, allowing the team to re-target one onto the other to make it as accurate as possible. Cameron stated that there was possibility that the film could be shown in \\"glasses-free 3D\\", although it is not entirely certain. Music On December 17, 2019, it was reported that Simon Franglen, who had worked on the original film as producer of both the score and the original song \\"I See You\\", and as arranger of the electronic music parts of the score, would compose new songs for Avatar 2 and Avatar 3. As of July 2020, no announcement has been made on the replacement for the original film's composer James Horner, who was originally reported to be engaged to write music for the franchise, before his death in a plane crash in June 2015. Marketing Steven Gould has been hired to write four novels based on the four Avatar sequels, starting with Avatar 2. After several media outlets shared rumors of potential titles for the Avatar sequels, including Avatar: The Way of Water for Avatar 2, Cameron confirmed that the titles mentioned were \\"among titles that are in consideration, but no final decisions have been made yet.\\" Sequels Avatar 2 is the first of four planned sequels to Avatar; Avatar 3 started filming simultaneously with Avatar 2 in New Zealand on September 25, 2017. Avatar 2 cast members Worthington, Saldana, Lang, Weaver, Pounder, Curtis, Ribisi, Moore, Rao, Gerald and Chaplin have all been announced for Avatar 3. Although the last two sequels have been reportedly greenlit, Cameron stated in a November 2017 interview: \\"Let's face it, if Avatar 2 and 3 don't make enough money, there's not going to be a 4 and 5\\". Avatar 3 cast member David Thewlis later confirmed this in February 2018, stating \\"they're making 2 and 3, they're gonna see if people go and see them, and then they'll make 4 and 5.\\" Conversely, Weaver stated in November 2018, after the first two sequels had completed main photography, that she was currently \\"busy doing Avatar 4 and 5\\", which several media outlets interpreted as confirmation that the last two sequels had started filming. In January 2019, in face of the proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox by The Walt Disney Company, Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed that both Avatar 4 and Avatar 5 are being developed but haven't been officially greenlit. According to producer Landau in February 2019, Iger may have been misinterpreted. He said that Avatar 4 and 5 \\"are not only [greenlit]\\" but also a third of Avatar 4 has already been filmed.Alita: Battle Angel - The Cast & Filmmakers discuss making the Manga epic. In: YouTube.

He was a contemporary and colleague of Mencius. In the Records of the Grand Historian, Chunyu Kun appears in Linzi, the capital of the northern state of Qi, as an adviser to the chief minister under King Wei of Qi, and as a master scholar at the Jixia Academy, the foremost institution of learning in ancient China. He is said to be \\"a man of Qi who lived with his wife's family. He was less than five feet tall. Thanks to his wit and his ready tongue he was sent several times as an envoy to other states and was never worsted in argument.\\" He is discussed in the chapter called \\"Jesters\\" (ch. 126, Guji liezhuan ÊªëÁ®ΩÂàóÂÇ≥). \\"There is widespread agreement that the Yanzi Chunqiu [ÊôèÂ≠êÊò•Áßã] (The Spring and Autumn Annals of Minister Yan Ying) was an anthology of the writings of Jixia scholars. It is quite probable that it was composed by followers of Chunyu Kun.\\" There are several famous stories about Chunyu Kun. In a rhetorical argument with Mencius, he tried to get Mencius to say that, because men and women should never touch each other, it was wrong to save one's sister-in-law from drowning. Mencius replied that someone who would not rescue the woman is a wolf. Kun said, \\"'The whole kingdom is drowning. How strange it is that you will not rescue it!' Mencius answered, 'A drowning kingdom must be rescued with right principles, as a drowning sister-in-law has to be rescued with the hand. Do you wish me to rescue the kingdom with my hand?'\\" Chunyu Kun was so influential with the king of Qi that he was able to present scholars for promotion and introduce foreign advisers to the king. He was \\"a Qi nobleman famous for his erudition.\\" Chunyu Kun was also at the origin of the four- character idiom ÈÄÅÂÆ¢ÁïôÈ´° (pinyin=s√≤ngk√® li√∫k≈´n), which means \\"sending off the guests, Kun is left behind.\\" This means \\"getting lucky\\" and refers to his joke that he would drink a single cup of wine with the emperor, but a cask if he was with courtesans and had sent off all the other guests. In the Records of the Grand Historian, Sima Qian describes an incident in which Chunyu Kun's quick wit allowed him to advise his ruler to change his foolish command without getting in trouble himself. The powerful nation of Chu was sending a large army against Qi. The king of Qi gave Chunyu Kun a hundred catties of gold and ten four-horse carriages, and told him to go to the neighboring state of Zhao to ask for help. \\"Chunyu Kun threw back his head and laughed so hard that the cord of his hat snapped.\\" The king asked if he thought it was too little, and Chunyu Kun said, \\"How dare I?\\" \\"Then why are you laughing?\\" Chunyu Kun replied, \\"I saw... a man praying for a good harvest and offering one pig's trotter and one cup of wine. 'May the crops from the highland fill whole crates!' he prayed. 'May the crops from the lowland fill whole carts! May grain harvested in abundance fill my house!' He offered so little but expected so much in return. That is why I laughed.\\" The king then gave him \\"one thousand yi of gold, ten pairs of white jade discs and a hundred four-horse carriages.\\" Chunyu Kun took them and successfully arranged military aid from Zhao, which forced the troops of Chu to return home.

Meyer. The book was well received by some within the conservative, intelligent design and evangelical communities, but several other reviewers were critical and wrote that Meyer's claims are incorrect. Summary According to Meyer, historical sciences seek to establish past causes of events using three criteria: (1) that a proposed cause was present, (2) that independent evidence establishes that the proposed cause can indeed produce that event, and (3) that there is an absence of evidence of other possible causes. In his view, the first form of life would have been a functioning, self-replicating, and protein-synthesizing system of DNA and proteins, and as such an information-rich system. Meyer believes that chemical evolution, chance, and chemical necessity have not been proven capable of producing information-rich systems, and that intelligent design is therefore the best explanation for the emergence of life on this planet. He argues that definitions of science that would preclude intelligent design from being a science also preclude many other fields, already established as science, from being science. Meyer believes the designing mind is the God described by the Christian religion. He acknowledges that this may affect the motivations behind his theory. Reception The book has been well received by some within the conservative, intelligent design and evangelical communities.Times Review, The Times.

Meyer is a Christian, but atheists, and theists who believe God never intervenes in the natural world, will be instructed by his careful presentation of this fiendishly difficult problem.\\" Stephen Fletcher, chemist at Loughborough University, responded in The Times Literary Supplement that Nagel was \\"promot[ing] the book to the rest of us using statements that are factually incorrect.\\" Fletcher explained that, \\"Natural selection is in fact a chemical process as well as a biological process, and it was operating for about half a billion years before the earliest cellular life forms appear in the fossil record.\\" In another publication, Fletcher wrote that \\"I am afraid that reality has overtaken Meyer‚Äôs book and its flawed reasoning\\" in pointing out scientific problems with Meyer's work by citing how RNA \\"survived and evolved into our own human protein-making factory, and continues to make our fingers and toes.\\" Darrel Falk, co-president of the BioLogos Foundation and a biology professor at Point Loma Nazarene University, reviewed the book and used it as an example of why he does not support the intelligent design movement. Falk wrote that several of Meyer's claims, such as \\"no RNA molecule had ever been evolved in a test tube which could do more than join two building blocks together\\" and \\"the two different conditions for making two of the key building blocks that characterize an RNA molecule are incompatible\\", were proven wrong soon after the publication of Meyer's book. Falk was critical of Meyer's declaration of scientists, such as Michael Lynch, being wrong without Meyer conducting any experiments to falsify the established work in the field. Falk wrote, \\"the book is supposed to be a science book and the ID movement is purported to be primarily a scientific movement‚Äînot primarily a philosophical, religious, or even popular movement.\\" Falk concluded, \\"If the object of the book is to show that the Intelligent Design movement is a scientific movement, it has not succeeded. In fact, what it has succeeded in showing is that it is a popular movement grounded primarily in the hopes and dreams of those in philosophy, in religion, and especially those in the general public.\\" In 2010 the BioLogos Foundation published Meyer's response to Falk. The response criticizes Falk's characterization of Meyer's credentials as well as the lack of any evidence from Falk that the premise of his book is faulty. The American Scientific Affiliation, a Christian organization of scientists and others, published a detailed analysis of the book's assertions by their executive director, physicist Randall Isaac. He concluded, \\"It is laudable that Meyer takes the step to explore predictions that ID would make. Predictions that are testable are a vital part of the scientific process. But just making a prediction isn‚Äôt sufficient to indicate viable science. Astrologers and tasseologists can also make predictions and sometimes they may be right. Predictions must also be based on causal factors that are understood independently to exist and whose adequacy can be independently verified. The predictions must clearly differentiate between competing hypotheses. It is unfortunate that this set of dozen predictions is very weak on all counts. It is unlikely to make any difference in the debate. These tend not to be definitive in terms of distinguishing between ID or non ID and will only extend the discussion.\\" Steve Matheson, a developmental biologist at Calvin College (an institution of the Christian Reformed Church), wrote an analysis critical of the book. In a post on The Panda's Thumb, Richard Hoppe concluded that the book failed to make a strong case for ID. The Discovery Institute published a collection of responses to critics edited by David Klinghoffer.

It also involved diplomatic friction between France and Hungary, particularly with respect to the outcome of the subsequent investigations and the involvement of prominent political figures.  Background  Oph√©lie Bretnacher disappeared in Budapest, Hungary on December 4, 2008. She was part of the European exchange program known as the Erasmus Programme , City security cameras tracked part of her route after leaving a nightclub called Portside of Cuba. The footage showed her walking alone from Doh√°ny Street to De√°k Square up to the Sz√©chenyi Chain Bridge across the Danube. The captured videos have since been uploaded to YouTube. Investigations revealed that she left the club after an argument with her boyfriend, who was identified as Paolo Pierre, an Italian student. Her companions recounted that she already drank liquor before going out. Her bag and cell phone were later found on the Sz√©chenyi Chain Bridge. The police were only alerted about her disappearance two days later. Her friends and family used several methods to attempt to find her. An official investigation was opened in Hungary and was soon followed by one in France. Bretnacher's body was discovered in Csepel, in February 2009, in a backwater of the Danube. The criminal case After the discovery of her body, Hungarian authorities assigned a seven-member police team to investigate the case. The police said that death was probably the result of a suicide or accident. However, homicide cannot be ruled out, L‚ÄôEst R√©publicain 4 December 2009 because of the finding of a hematoma on Ophelie's body as well as many gray areas during the search., L‚ÄôUnion February 14, 2009 One of the puzzles, for instance, was that her body was found upstream. , L‚ÄôEst R√©publicain, 2009-12-03.

New information reportedly surfaced, prompting the Budapest prosecutor's office to continue the inquiry. Sources say that investigation resumed due to inconsistencies in the testimonies of the interrogated witnesses.thumb Political and diplomatic consequences While Hungarian police concluded that the case could either be a suicide or accidental drowning, in France, there was a public clamor for a more thorough investigation. An online petition has been signed by over 10,000 people and was sent to the French President. By January 11, 2009, several hundred people marched silently in a white march, from the Champ-de-Mars, near the Eiffel Tower, to seek the involvement of the French authorities. French politicians also expressed interest such as Catherine Vautrin, the Vice- Pr√©sident of the National Assembly, who called for a French intervention Following this intervention, French investigators were sent for the second time to Hungary.  Conclusion  This affair was closed in Hungary in 2014.

The highway runs from Snug Harbor Road in Shady Side north to MD 214 in Edgewater. MD 468 is a J-shaped route that connects Edgewater with the Chesapeake Bay communities of Galesville and Shady Side. The Galesville-Shady Side road was constructed as part of MD 255 in the 1920s. MD 468 was constructed north of MD 255 in the early 1930s. MD 255 was rerouted to enter Galesville and MD 468 was extended along MD 255's old route to Shady Side in the late 1940s. Route description View south along MD 468 at MD 255 in Galesville MD 468 begins at an intersection with West Shady Side Road, which heads north toward the Capt. Salem Avery House, and Snug Harbor Road, which heads east toward Snug Harbor Park and the Idlewilde peninsula. The highway heads south as two-lane undivided Shady Side Road. MD 468 gradually curves to the west and meets the eastern end of MD 256 (Deale Churchton Road) as the highway passes north of the hamlet of Churchton. The highway continues west as Muddy Creek Road and intersects Sudley Road, which provides access to the historic home Sudley. MD 468 gradually curves to the north and crosses three streams that flow into the West River. The highway intersects MD 255 adjacent to the Quaker Burying Ground; the highway heads east as Galesville Road into the namesake village and west as Owensville Road. MD 468 passes to the west of three historic homes: Tulip Hill, which is accessed directly from the route; and Cedar Park and Parkhurst. After passing Old Muddy Creek Road, an old alignment, the road crosses over several branches of Muddy Creek within the Birds Mill Swamp. After leaving the swamp, the road passes Contee Wharf Road and South River Clubhouse Road. The former road leads east to the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center and the latter passes the historic meeting place of the South River Club. After passing another old alignment of MD 468 in Clydesdale Road, the road meets its northern terminus at MD 214 (Central Avenue) on the southeastern edge of Edgewater. History MD 468 originally included Muddy Creek Road from MD 255 north to Edgewater. The portion of MD 468 from MD 255 to Shady Side was part of MD 255 and the highway from the MD 255-MD 468 intersection east to Galesville was MD 393. The first work done along MD 468's modern course was grading work from the MD 255-MD 468 intersection south to Sudley Road in 1920. The gravel highway was completed between those intersections in 1921 and proposed to extend to the modern intersection with MD 256. The highway extended to Deep Creek Road on the south side of Shady Side in 1923. MD 255 was completed to Shady Side in 1929 and 1930. MD 468 was constructed in three sections. The first section from MD 253 (now MD 214) south to near Collins Road was started in 1930 and completed as a gravel road by 1933. The highway was extended south to Lansdale Road in 1932 and 1933. MD 468 was completed to MD 255 in 1933 and 1934. By 1934, traffic on the Galesville-Shady Side segment was dense enough that the road was recommended to be widened from . MD 468 was extended south along MD 255's route to Shady Side and MD 255 replaced MD 393 into Galesville in 1949. MD 468 originally followed what are now Old Muddy Creek Road and Clydesdale Road. Those curvaceous segments were replaced with the current straighter alignment in 1960. MD 468 once extended a short distance along Snug Harbor Road from its present terminus in Shady Side. The highway was retracted to its present terminus by 1987.

It originated with the 16th century Reformation, a movement against what its followers perceived to be errors in the Catholic Church. Protestants reject the Roman Catholic doctrine of papal supremacy and sacraments, but disagree among themselves regarding the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist and matters of church polity and apostolic succession. They emphasize the priesthood of all believers, justification by faith alone (') rather than also by good works and the highest authority of the Bible alone (rather than also with sacred tradition) in faith and morals ('). The \\"five solae\\" summarise basic theological differences in opposition to the Catholic Church. Protestantism began in Germany in 1517, when Martin Luther published his Ninety-five Theses as a reaction against abuses in the sale of indulgences by the Catholic Church, which purported to offer the remission of the temporal punishment of sins to their purchasers. The term, however, derives from the letter of protestation from German Lutheran princes in 1529 against an edict of the Diet of Speyer condemning the teachings of Martin Luther as heretical.Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (1974) art. \\"Speyer (Spires), Diets of\\" Although there were earlier breaks and attempts to reform the Catholic Church‚Äînotably by Peter Waldo, John Wycliffe and Jan Hus‚Äîonly Luther succeeded in sparking a wider, lasting and modern movement. In the 16th century, Lutheranism spread from Germany into Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Latvia, Estonia and Iceland. Reformed (or Calvinist) denominations spread in Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Scotland, Switzerland and France by Protestant Reformers such as John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli and John Knox. The political separation of the Church of England from the pope under King Henry VIII began Anglicanism, bringing England and Wales into this broad Reformation movement. Protestants have developed their own culture, with major contributions in education, the humanities and sciences, the political and social order, the economy and the arts and many other fields.Karl Heussi, Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte, 11. Auflage (1956), T√ºbingen (Germany), pp. 317‚Äì319, 325‚Äì326 Protestantism is diverse, being more divided theologically and ecclesiastically than the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church or Oriental Orthodoxy. Without structural unity or central human authority, Protestants developed the concept of an invisible church, in contrast to the Catholic, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, the Assyrian Church of the East and the Ancient Church of the East, which all understand themselves as the one and only original church‚Äîthe one true church‚Äîfounded by Jesus Christ. Some denominations do have a worldwide scope and distribution of membership, while others are confined to a single country. A majority of Protestants are members of a handful of Protestant denominational families: Adventists, Anabaptists, Anglicans, Baptists, Calvinist/Reformed, Lutherans, Methodists, and Pentecostals. Nondenominational, Charismatic, Evangelical, Independent, and other churches are on the rise, and constitute a significant part of Protestantism.World Council of Churches: Evangelical churches: \\"Evangelical churches have grown exponentially in the second half of the 20th century and continue to show great vitality, especially in the global South. This resurgence may in part be explained by the phenomenal growth of Pentecostalism and the emergence of the charismatic movement, which are closely associated with evangelicalism. However, there can be no doubt that the evangelical tradition \\"per se\\" has become one of the major components of world Christianity. Evangelicals also constitute sizable minorities in the traditional Protestant and Anglican churches. In regions like Africa and Latin America, the boundaries between \\"evangelical\\" and \\"mainline\\" are rapidly changing and giving way to new ecclesial realities.\\" Proponents of the branch theory consider Protestantism one of the four major divisions of Christianity, together with the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Oriental Orthodox Churches. Terminology=Protestant Six princes of the Holy Roman Empire and rulers of fourteen Imperial Free Cities, who issued a protest (or dissent) against the edict of the Diet of Speyer (1529), were the first individuals to be called Protestants. The edict reversed concessions made to the Lutherans with the approval of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V three years earlier. The term protestant, though initially purely political in nature, later acquired a broader sense, referring to a member of any Western church which subscribed to the main Protestant principles. Any Western Christian who is not an adherent of the Catholic Church or Eastern Orthodox Church is a Protestant. A Protestant is an adherent of any of those Christian bodies that separated from the Church of Rome during the Reformation, or of any group descended from them. During the Reformation, the term protestant was hardly used outside of German politics. People who were involved in the religious movement used the word evangelical (). For further details, see the section below. Gradually, protestant became a general term, meaning any adherent of the Reformation in the German-speaking area. It was ultimately somewhat taken up by Lutherans, even though Martin Luther himself insisted on Christian or evangelical as the only acceptable names for individuals who professed Christ. French and Swiss Protestants instead preferred the word reformed (), which became a popular, neutral, and alternative name for Calvinists. Evangelical Direction signs showing ways to two different Protestant churches in the German city of Wiesbaden. The word evangelical (), which refers to the gospel, was widely used for those involved in the religious movement in the German-speaking area beginning in 1517. Nowadays, evangelical is still preferred among some of the historical Protestant denominations in the Lutheran, Calvinist, and United Protestant (Lutheran & Reformed) traditions in Europe, and those with strong ties to them (e.g. Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod). Above all the term is used by Protestant bodies in the German-speaking area, such as the Evangelical Church in Germany. In continental Europe, an Evangelical is either a Lutheran, a Calvinist, or a United Protestant (Lutheran & Reformed). The German word ' means Protestant, and is different from the German ', which refers to churches shaped by Evangelicalism. The English word evangelical usually refers to evangelical Protestant churches, and therefore to a certain part of Protestantism rather than to Protestantism as a whole. The English word traces its roots back to the Puritans in England, where Evangelicalism originated, and then was brought to the United States. Martin Luther always disliked the term Lutheran, preferring the term evangelical, which was derived from euangelion, a Greek word meaning \\"good news\\", i.e. \\"gospel\\".Esp√≠n, Orlando O. and Nickoloff, James B. An introductory dictionary of theology and religious studies. Collegeville, Minnesota: Liturgical Press, p. 796. The followers of John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli, and other theologians linked to the Reformed tradition also began to use that term. To distinguish the two evangelical groups, others began to refer to the two groups as Evangelical Lutheran and Evangelical Reformed. Nowadays, the word also pertains in the same way to some other mainline groups, for example Evangelical Methodist. As time passed by, the word evangelical was dropped. Lutherans themselves began to use the term Lutheran in the middle of the 16th century, in order to distinguish themselves from other groups such as the Philippists and Calvinists. Reformational The German word ', which roughly translates to English as \\"reformational\\" or \\"reforming\\", is used as an alternative for ' in German, and is different from English reformed (), which refers to churches shaped by ideas of John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli and other Reformed theologians. Being derived from the word \\"Reformation\\", the term emerged around the same time as evangelical (1517) and protestant (1529). Theology=Main principles Various experts on the subject tried to determine what makes a Christian denomination a part of Protestantism. A common consensus approved by most of them is that if a Christian denomination is to be considered Protestant, it must acknowledge the following three fundamental principles of Protestantism. ;Scripture alone: The belief, emphasized by Luther, in the Bible as the highest source of authority for the church. The early churches of the Reformation believed in a critical, yet serious, reading of scripture and holding the Bible as a source of authority higher than that of church tradition. The many abuses that had occurred in the Western Church before the Protestant Reformation led the Reformers to reject much of its tradition, though some would maintain tradition has been maintained and reorganized in the liturgy and in the confessions of the Protestant churches of the Reformation. In the early 20th century, a less critical reading of the Bible developed in the United States, leading to a \\"fundamentalist\\" reading of Scripture. Christian fundamentalists read the Bible as the \\"inerrant, infallible\\" Word of God, as do the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican and Lutheran churches, but interpret it in a literalist fashion without using the historical critical method. \\"Biblical Christianity\\" focused on a deep study of the Bible is characteristic of most Protestants as opposed to \\"Church Christianity\\", focused on performing rituals and good works, represented by Catholic and Orthodox traditions. However Quakers and Pentecostalists, emphasize the Holy Spirit and personal closeness to God.Woodhead, Linda. Christianity: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford University Press, 2014) pp. 57‚Äì70 ;Justification by faith alone: The belief that believers are justified, or pardoned for sin, solely on condition of faith in Christ rather than a combination of faith and good works. For Protestants, good works are a necessary consequence rather than cause of justification.Johann Jakob Herzog, Philip Schaff, Albert. The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge. 1911, p. 419. https://books.google.com/books?id=AmYAAAAAMAAJ&pg;=PA419 However, while justification is by faith alone, there is the position that faith is not nuda fides. John Calvin explained that \\"it is therefore faith alone which justifies, and yet the faith which justifies is not alone: just as it is the heat alone of the sun which warms the earth, and yet in the sun it is not alone.\\" ;Universal priesthood of believers: The universal priesthood of believers implies the right and duty of the Christian laity not only to read the Bible in the vernacular, but also to take part in the government and all the public affairs of the Church. It is opposed to the hierarchical system which puts the essence and authority of the Church in an exclusive priesthood, and which makes ordained priests the necessary mediators between God and the people. It is distinguished from the concept of the priesthood of all believers, which did not grant individuals the right to interpret the Bible apart from the Christian community at large because universal priesthood opened the door to such a possibility. There are scholars who cite that this doctrine tends to subsume all distinctions in the church under a single spiritual entity. Calvin referred to the universal priesthood as an expression of the relation between the believer and his God, including the freedom of a Christian to come to God through Christ without human mediation. He also maintained that this principle recognizes Christ as prophet, priest, and king and that his priesthood is shared with his people. Trinity The Trinity is the belief that God is one God in three persons: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus), and God the Holy Spirit. Protestants who adhere to the Nicene Creed believe in three persons (God the Father, God the Son, and the Holy Spirit) as one God. Movements emerging around the time of the Protestant Reformation, but not a part of Protestantism, e.g. Unitarianism also reject the Trinity. This often serves as a reason for exclusion of the Unitarian Universalism, Oneness Pentecostalism and other movements from Protestantism by various observers. Unitarianism continues to have a presence mainly in Transylvania, England and the United States, as well as elsewhere. Five solae The Five ' are five Latin phrases (or slogans) that emerged during the Protestant Reformation and summarize the reformers' basic differences in theological beliefs in opposition to the teaching of the Catholic Church of the day. The Latin word ' means \\"alone\\", \\"only\\", or \\"single\\". The use of the phrases as summaries of teaching emerged over time during the Reformation, based on the overarching principle of ' (by scripture alone). This idea contains the four main doctrines on the Bible: that its teaching is needed for salvation (necessity); that all the doctrine necessary for salvation comes from the Bible alone (sufficiency); that everything taught in the Bible is correct (inerrancy); and that, by the Holy Spirit overcoming sin, believers may read and understand truth from the Bible itself, though understanding is difficult, so the means used to guide individual believers to the true teaching is often mutual discussion within the church (clarity). The necessity and inerrancy were well-established ideas, garnering little criticism, though they later came under debate from outside during the Enlightenment. The most contentious idea at the time though was the notion that anyone could simply pick up the Bible and learn enough to gain salvation. Though the reformers were concerned with ecclesiology (the doctrine of how the church as a body works), they had a different understanding of the process in which truths in scripture were applied to life of believers, compared to the Catholics' idea that certain people within the church, or ideas that were old enough, had a special status in giving understanding of the text. The second main principle, ' (by faith alone), states that faith in Christ is sufficient alone for eternal salvation and justification. Though argued from scripture, and hence logically consequent to ', this is the guiding principle of the work of Luther and the later reformers. Because ' placed the Bible as the only source of teaching, ' epitomises the main thrust of the teaching the reformers wanted to get back to, namely the direct, close, personal connection between Christ and the believer, hence the reformers' contention that their work was Christocentric. The other solas, as statements, emerged later, but the thinking they represent was also part of the early Reformation. * ': Christ alone : The Protestants characterize the dogma concerning the Pope as Christ's representative head of the Church on earth, the concept of works made meritorious by Christ, and the Catholic idea of a treasury of the merits of Christ and his saints, as a denial that Christ is the only mediator between God and man. Catholics, on the other hand, maintained the traditional understanding of Judaism on these questions, and appealed to the universal consensus of Christian tradition., , , , * ': Grace alone : Protestants perceived Catholic salvation to be dependent upon the grace of God and the merits of one's own works. The reformers posited that salvation is a gift of God (i.e., God's act of free grace), dispensed by the Holy Spirit owing to the redemptive work of Jesus Christ alone. Consequently, they argued that a sinner is not accepted by God on account of the change wrought in the believer by God's grace, and that the believer is accepted without regard for the merit of his works, for no one deserves salvation. * ': Glory to God alone : All glory is due to God alone since salvation is accomplished solely through his will and action‚Äînot only the gift of the all-sufficient atonement of Jesus on the cross but also the gift of faith in that atonement, created in the heart of the believer by the Holy Spirit. The reformers believed that human beings‚Äîeven saints canonized by the Catholic Church, the popes, and the ecclesiastical hierarchy‚Äîare not worthy of the glory. Christ's presence in the Eucharist A Lutheran depiction of the Last Supper by Lucas Cranach the Elder, 1547. The Protestant movement began to diverge into several distinct branches in the mid-to-late 16th century. One of the central points of divergence was controversy over the Eucharist. Early Protestants rejected the Catholic dogma of transubstantiation, which teaches that the bread and wine used in the sacrificial rite of the Mass lose their natural substance by being transformed into the body, blood, soul, and divinity of Christ. They disagreed with one another concerning the presence of Christ and his body and blood in Holy Communion. * Lutherans hold that within the Lord's Supper the consecrated elements of bread and wine are the true body and blood of Christ \\"in, with, and under the form\\" of bread and wine for all those who eat and drink it, Engelder, T.E.W., Popular Symbolics. St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1934. p. 95, Part XXIV. \\"The Lord's Supper\\", paragraph 131. a doctrine that the Formula of Concord calls the Sacramental union. God earnestly offers to all who receive the sacrament, forgiveness of sins, and eternal salvation. * The Reformed churches emphasize the real spiritual presence, or sacramental presence, of Christ, saying that the sacrament is a sanctifying grace through which the elect believer does not actually partake of Christ, but merely with the bread and wine rather than in the elements. Calvinists deny the Lutheran assertion that all communicants, both believers and unbelievers, orally receive Christ's body and blood in the elements of the sacrament but instead affirm that Christ is united to the believer through faith‚Äîtoward which the supper is an outward and visible aid. This is often referred to as dynamic presence. * Anglicans and Methodists refuse to define the Presence, preferring to leave it a mystery. The Prayer Books describe the bread and wine as outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace which is the Body and Blood of Christ. However, the words of their liturgies suggest that one can hold to a belief in the Real Presence and Spiritual and Sacramental Present at the same time. For example, \\"... and you have fed us with the spiritual food in the Sacrament of his body and Blood;\\" \\"...the spiritual food of the most precious Body and Blood of your Son our Saviour Jesus Christ, and for assuring us in these holy mysteries...\\" American Book of Common Prayer, 1977, pp. 365‚Äì366. * Anabaptists hold a popular simplification of the Zwinglian view, without concern for theological intricacies as hinted at above, may see the Lord's Supper merely as a symbol of the shared faith of the participants, a commemoration of the facts of the crucifixion, and a reminder of their standing together as the body of Christ (a view referred to as memorialism). History=Pre-Reformation Execution of Jan Hus in 1415. Spread of Lollardy in medieval England and medieval Scotland. In the late 1130s, Arnold of Brescia, an Italian canon regular became one of the first theologians to attempt to reform the Catholic Church. After his death, his teachings on apostolic poverty gained currency among Arnoldists, and later more widely among Waldensians and the Spiritual Franciscans, though no written word of his has survived the official condemnation. In the early 1170s, Peter Waldo founded the Waldensians. He advocated an interpretation of the Gospel that led to conflicts with the Catholic Church. By 1215, the Waldensians were declared heretical and subject to persecution. Despite that, the movement continues to exist to this day in Italy, as a part of the wider Reformed tradition. In the 1370s, John Wycliffe‚Äîlater dubbed the \\"Morning Star of Reformation\\"‚Äîstarted his activity as an English reformer. He rejected papal authority over secular power, translated the Bible into vernacular English, and preached anticlerical and biblically-centred reforms. Beginning in the first decade of the 15th century, Jan Hus‚Äîa Catholic priest, Czech reformist and professor‚Äîinfluenced by John Wycliffe's writings, founded the Hussite movement. He strongly advocated his reformist Bohemian religious denomination. He was excommunicated and burned at the stake in Constance, Bishopric of Constance in 1415 by secular authorities for unrepentant and persistent heresy. After his execution, a revolt erupted. Hussites defeated five continuous crusades proclaimed against them by the Pope. Later on, theological disputes caused a split within the Hussite movement. Utraquists maintained that both the bread and the wine should be administered to the people during the Eucharist. Another major faction were the Taborites, who opposed the Utraquists in the Battle of Lipany during the Hussite Wars. There were two separate parties among the Hussites: moderate and radical movements. Other smaller regional Hussite branches in Bohemia included Adamites, Orebites, Orphans and Praguers. The Hussite Wars concluded with the victory of Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, his Catholic allies and moderate Hussites and the defeat of the radical Hussites. Tensions arose as the Thirty Years' War reached Bohemia in 1620. Both moderate and radical Hussitism was increasingly persecuted by Catholics and Holy Roman Emperor's armies. Starting in 1475, an Italian Dominican friar Girolamo Savonarola was calling for a Christian renewal. Later on, Martin Luther himself read some of the friar's writings and praised him as a martyr and forerunner whose ideas on faith and grace anticipated Luther's own doctrine of justification by faith alone. Some of Hus' followers founded the Unitas Fratrum‚Äî\\"Unity of the Brethren\\"‚Äîwhich was renewed under the leadership of Count Nicolaus von Zinzendorf in Herrnhut, Saxony in 1722 after its almost total destruction in the Thirty Years' War and the Counter-Reformation. Today, it is usually referred to in English as the Moravian Church and in German as the Herrnhuter Br√ºdergemeine. Reformation proper Distribution of Protestantism and Catholicism in Central Europe on the eve of the Thirty Years' War (1618) The Protestant Reformation began as an attempt to reform the Catholic Church. On 31 October 1517 (All Hallows' Eve) Martin Luther allegedly nailed his Ninety-five Theses (Disputation on the Power of Indulgences) on the door of the All Saints' Church in Wittenberg, Germany, detailing doctrinal and practical abuses of the Catholic Church, especially the selling of indulgences. The theses debated and criticized many aspects of the Church and the papacy, including the practice of purgatory, particular judgment, and the authority of the pope. Luther would later write works against the Catholic devotion to Virgin Mary, the intercession of and devotion to the saints, mandatory clerical celibacy, monasticism, the authority of the pope, the ecclesiastical law, censure and excommunication, the role of secular rulers in religious matters, the relationship between Christianity and the law, good works, and the sacraments.Schofield Martin Luther p. 122 The Reformation was a triumph of literacy and the new printing press invented by Johannes Gutenberg.Cameron European Reformation Luther's translation of the Bible into German was a decisive moment in the spread of literacy, and stimulated as well the printing and distribution of religious books and pamphlets. From 1517 onward, religious pamphlets flooded much of Europe.Edwards Printing, Propaganda, and Martin Luther Following the excommunication of Luther and condemnation of the Reformation by the Pope, the work and writings of John Calvin were influential in establishing a loose consensus among various groups in Switzerland, Scotland, Hungary, Germany and elsewhere. After the expulsion of its Bishop in 1526, and the unsuccessful attempts of the Bern reformer William Farel, Calvin was asked to use the organisational skill he had gathered as a student of law to discipline the city of Geneva. His Ordinances of 1541 involved a collaboration of Church affairs with the City council and consistory to bring morality to all areas of life. After the establishment of the Geneva academy in 1559, Geneva became the unofficial capital of the Protestant movement, providing refuge for Protestant exiles from all over Europe and educating them as Calvinist missionaries. The faith continued to spread after Calvin's death in 1563. Protestantism also spread from the German lands into France, where the Protestants were nicknamed Huguenots. Calvin continued to take an interest in the French religious affairs from his base in Geneva. He regularly trained pastors to lead congregations there. Despite heavy persecution, the Reformed tradition made steady progress across large sections of the nation, appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment. French Protestantism came to acquire a distinctly political character, made all the more obvious by the conversions of nobles during the 1550s. This established the preconditions for a series of conflicts, known as the French Wars of Religion. The civil wars gained impetus with the sudden death of Henry II of France in 1559. Atrocity and outrage became the defining characteristics of the time, illustrated at their most intense in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of August 1572, when the Catholic party annihilated between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across France. The wars only concluded when Henry IV of France issued the Edict of Nantes, promising official toleration of the Protestant minority, but under highly restricted conditions. Catholicism remained the official state religion, and the fortunes of French Protestants gradually declined over the next century, culminating in Louis XIV's Edict of Fontainebleau which revoked the Edict of Nantes and made Catholicism the sole legal religion once again. In response to the Edict of Fontainebleau, Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg declared the Edict of Potsdam, giving free passage to Huguenot refugees. In the late 17th century many Huguenots fled to England, the Netherlands, Prussia, Switzerland, and the English and Dutch overseas colonies. A significant community in France remained in the C√©vennes region. Parallel to events in Germany, a movement began in Switzerland under the leadership of Huldrych Zwingli. Zwingli was a scholar and preacher, who in 1518 moved to Zurich. Although the two movements agreed on many issues of theology, some unresolved differences kept them separate. A long-standing resentment between the German states and the Swiss Confederation led to heated debate over how much Zwingli owed his ideas to Lutheranism. The German Prince Philip of Hesse saw potential in creating an alliance between Zwingli and Luther. A meeting was held in his castle in 1529, now known as the Colloquy of Marburg, which has become infamous for its failure. The two men could not come to any agreement due to their disputation over one key doctrine. In 1534, King Henry VIII put an end to all papal jurisdiction in England, after the Pope failed to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon;William P. Haugaard \\"The History of Anglicanism I\\" in The Study of Anglicanism Stephen Sykes and John Booty (eds) (SPCK 1987) pp. 6‚Äì7 this opened the door to reformational ideas. Reformers in the Church of England alternated between sympathies for ancient Catholic tradition and more Reformed principles, gradually developing into a tradition considered a middle way (') between the Catholic and Protestant traditions. The English Reformation followed a particular course. The different character of the English Reformation came primarily from the fact that it was driven initially by the political necessities of Henry VIII. King Henry decided to remove the Church of England from the authority of Rome. In 1534, the Act of Supremacy recognized Henry as the only Supreme Head on earth of the Church of England. Between 1535 and 1540, under Thomas Cromwell, the policy known as the Dissolution of the Monasteries was put into effect. Following a brief Catholic restoration during the reign of Mary I, a loose consensus developed during the reign of Elizabeth I. The Elizabethan Religious Settlement largely formed Anglicanism into a distinctive church tradition. The compromise was uneasy and was capable of veering between extreme Calvinism on the one hand and Catholicism on the other. It was relatively successful until the Puritan Revolution or English Civil War in the 17th century. The success of the Counter-Reformation on the Continent and the growth of a Puritan party dedicated to further Protestant reform polarised the Elizabethan Age. The early Puritan movement was a movement for reform in the Church of England. The desire was for the Church of England to resemble more closely the Protestant churches of Europe, especially Geneva. The later Puritan movement, often referred to as dissenters and nonconformists, eventually led to the formation of various Reformed denominations. The Scottish Reformation of 1560 decisively shaped the Church of Scotland.Article 1, of the Articles Declaratory of the Constitution of the Church of Scotland 1921 states 'The Church of Scotland adheres to the Scottish Reformation'. The Reformation in Scotland culminated ecclesiastically in the establishment of a church along Reformed lines, and politically in the triumph of English influence over that of France. John Knox is regarded as the leader of the Scottish Reformation. The Scottish Reformation Parliament of 1560 repudiated the pope's authority by the Papal Jurisdiction Act 1560, forbade the celebration of the Mass and approved a Protestant Confession of Faith. It was made possible by a revolution against French hegemony under the regime of the regent Mary of Guise, who had governed Scotland in the name of her absent daughter. Some of the most important activists of the Protestant Reformation included Jacobus Arminius, Theodore Beza, Martin Bucer, Andreas von Carlstadt, Heinrich Bullinger, Balthasar Hubmaier, Thomas Cranmer, William Farel, Thomas M√ºntzer, Laurentius Petri, Olaus Petri, Philipp Melanchthon, Menno Simons, Louis de Berquin, Primo≈æ Trubar and John Smyth. In the course of this religious upheaval, the German Peasants' War of 1524‚Äì25 swept through the Bavarian, Thuringian and Swabian principalities. After the Eighty Years' War in the Low Countries and the French Wars of Religion, the confessional division of the states of the Holy Roman Empire eventually erupted in the Thirty Years' War between 1618 and 1648. It devastated much of Germany, killing between 25% and 40% of its population.\\"History of Europe ‚Äì Demographics\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. The main tenets of the Peace of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years' War, were: * All parties would now recognise the Peace of Augsburg of 1555, by which each prince would have the right to determine the religion of his own state, the options being Catholicism, Lutheranism, and now Calvinism. (the principle of cuius regio, eius religio) * Christians living in principalities where their denomination was not the established church were guaranteed the right to practice their faith in public during allotted hours and in private at their will. * The treaty also effectively ended the papacy's pan-European political power. Pope Innocent X declared the treaty \\"null, void, invalid, iniquitous, unjust, damnable, reprobate, inane, empty of meaning and effect for all times\\" in his bull '. European sovereigns, Catholic and Protestant alike, ignored his verdict.Cross, (ed.) \\"Westphalia, Peace of\\" Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church Post-Reformation The Great Awakenings were periods of rapid and dramatic religious revival in Anglo-American religious history. The First Great Awakening was an evangelical and revitalization movement that swept through Protestant Europe and British America, especially the American colonies in the 1730s and 1740s, leaving a permanent impact on American Protestantism. It resulted from powerful preaching that gave listeners a sense of deep personal revelation of their need of salvation by Jesus Christ. Pulling away from ritual, ceremony, sacramentalism and hierarchy, it made Christianity intensely personal to the average person by fostering a deep sense of spiritual conviction and redemption, and by encouraging introspection and a commitment to a new standard of personal morality.Thomas S. Kidd, The Great Awakening: The Roots of Evangelical Christianity in Colonial America (2009) 1839 Methodist camp meeting during the Second Great Awakening in the U.S. The Second Great Awakening began around 1790. It gained momentum by 1800. After 1820, membership rose rapidly among Baptist and Methodist congregations, whose preachers led the movement. It was past its peak by the late 1840s. It has been described as a reaction against skepticism, deism, and rationalism, although why those forces became pressing enough at the time to spark revivals is not fully understood.Nancy Cott, \\"Young Women in the Great Awakening in New England,\\" Feminist Studies 3, no. 1/2 (Autumn 1975): 15. It enrolled millions of new members in existing evangelical denominations and led to the formation of new denominations. The Third Great Awakening refers to a hypothetical historical period that was marked by religious activism in American history and spans the late 1850s to the early 20th century.William G. McLoughlin, Revivals Awakenings and Reform (1980) It affected pietistic Protestant denominations and had a strong element of social activism.Mark A. Noll, A History of Christianity in the United States and Canada (1992) pp. 286‚Äì310 It gathered strength from the postmillennial belief that the Second Coming of Christ would occur after mankind had reformed the entire earth. It was affiliated with the Social Gospel Movement, which applied Christianity to social issues and gained its force from the Awakening, as did the worldwide missionary movement. New groupings emerged, such as the Holiness, Nazarene, and Christian Science movements.Robert William Fogel, The Fourth Great Awakening and the Future of Egalitarianism (2000) The Fourth Great Awakening was a Christian religious awakening that some scholars‚Äîmost notably, Robert Fogel‚Äîsay took place in the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s, while others look at the era following World War II. The terminology is controversial. Thus, the idea of a Fourth Great Awakening itself has not been generally accepted.Robert William Fogel (2000), The Fourth Great Awakening & the Future of Egalitarianism; see the review by Randall Balmer, Journal of Interdisciplinary History 2002 33(2): 322‚Äì325 In 1814, Le R√©veil swept through Calvinist regions in Switzerland and France. In 1904, a Protestant revival in Wales had tremendous impact on the local population. A part of British modernization, it drew many people to churches, especially Methodist and Baptist ones. A noteworthy development in 20th-century Protestant Christianity was the rise of the modern Pentecostal movement. Sprung from Methodist and Wesleyan roots, it arose out of meetings at an urban mission on Azusa Street in Los Angeles. From there it spread around the world, carried by those who experienced what they believed to be miraculous moves of God there. These Pentecost-like manifestations have steadily been in evidence throughout the history, such as seen in the two Great Awakenings. Pentecostalism, which in turn birthed the Charismatic movement within already established denominations, continues to be an important force in Western Christianity. In the United States and elsewhere in the world, there has been a marked rise in the evangelical wing of Protestant denominations, especially those that are more exclusively evangelical, and a corresponding decline in the mainstream liberal churches. In the post‚ÄìWorld War I era, Liberal Christianity was on the rise, and a considerable number of seminaries held and taught from a liberal perspective as well. In the post‚ÄìWorld War II era, the trend began to swing back towards the conservative camp in America's seminaries and church structures. In Europe, there has been a general move away from religious observance and belief in Christian teachings and a move towards secularism. The Enlightenment is largely responsible for the spread of secularism. Several scholars have argued for a link between the rise of secularism and Protestantism, attributing it to the wide-ranging freedom in the Protestant- majority countries. In North America, South America and Australia Christian religious observance is much higher than in Europe. United States remains particularly religious in comparison to other developed countries. South America, historically Catholic, has experienced a large Evangelical and Pentecostal infusion in the 20th and 21st centuries. Radical Reformation Dissatisfaction with the outcome of a disputation in 1525 prompted Swiss Brethren to part ways with Huldrych Zwingli. Unlike mainstream Lutheran, Calvinist and Zwinglian movements, the Radical Reformation, which had no state sponsorship, generally abandoned the idea of the \\"Church visible\\" as distinct from the \\"Church invisible\\". It was a rational extension of the state-approved Protestant dissent, which took the value of independence from constituted authority a step further, arguing the same for the civic realm. The Radical Reformation was non-mainstream, though in parts of Germany, Switzerland and Austria, a majority would sympathize with the Radical Reformation despite the intense persecution it faced from both Catholics and Magisterial Protestants. The early Anabaptists believed that their reformation must purify not only theology but also the actual lives of Christians, especially their political and social relationships.Gonzalez, A History of Christian Thought, 88. Therefore, the church should not be supported by the state, neither by tithes and taxes, nor by the use of the sword; Christianity was a matter of individual conviction, which could not be forced on anyone, but rather required a personal decision for it. Protestant ecclesial leaders such as Hubmaier and Hofmann preached the invalidity of infant baptism, advocating baptism as following conversion (\\"believer's baptism\\") instead. This was not a doctrine new to the reformers, but was taught by earlier groups, such as the Albigenses in 1147. Though most of the Radical Reformers were Anabaptist, some did not identify themselves with the mainstream Anabaptist tradition. Thomas M√ºntzer was involved in the German Peasants' War. Andreas Karlstadt disagreed theologically with Huldrych Zwingli and Martin Luther, teaching nonviolence and refusing to baptize infants while not rebaptizing adult believers. Kaspar Schwenkfeld and Sebastian Franck were influenced by German mysticism and spiritualism. In the view of many associated with the Radical Reformation, the Magisterial Reformation had not gone far enough. Radical Reformer, Andreas von Bodenstein Karlstadt, for example, referred to the Lutheran theologians at Wittenberg as the \\"new papists\\".The Magisterial Reformation. Since the term \\"magister\\" also means \\"teacher\\", the Magisterial Reformation is also characterized by an emphasis on the authority of a teacher. This is made evident in the prominence of Luther, Calvin, and Zwingli as leaders of the reform movements in their respective areas of ministry. Because of their authority, they were often criticized by Radical Reformers as being too much like the Roman Popes. A more political side of the Radical Reformation can be seen in the thought and practice of Hans Hut, although typically Anabaptism has been associated with pacifism. Anabaptism in shape of its various diversification such as the Amish, Mennonites and Hutterites came out of the Radical Reformation. Later in history, Schwarzenau Brethren, and the Apostolic Christian Church would emerge in Anabaptist circles. Denominations thumbupright=1.25rightProtestantism as state religion: Protestants refer to specific groupings of congregations or churches that share in common foundational doctrines and the name of their groups as denominations. The term denomination (national body) is to be distinguished from branch (denominational family; tradition), communion (international body) and congregation (church). An example (this is no universal way to classify Protestant churches, as these may sometimes vary broadly in their structures) to show the difference: Branch/denominational family/tradition: Methodism Communion/international body: World Methodist Council Denomination/national body: United Methodist Church Congregation/church: First United Methodist Church (Paintsville, Kentucky) Protestants reject the Catholic Church's doctrine that it is the one true church, believing in the invisible church, which consists of all who profess faith in Jesus Christ. Some Protestant denominations are less accepting of other denominations, and the basic orthodoxy of some is questioned by most of the others. Individual denominations also have formed over very subtle theological differences. Other denominations are simply regional or ethnic expressions of the same beliefs. Because the five solas are the main tenets of the Protestant faith, non-denominational groups and organizations are also considered Protestant. Various ecumenical movements have attempted cooperation or reorganization of the various divided Protestant denominations, according to various models of union, but divisions continue to outpace unions, as there is no overarching authority to which any of the churches owe allegiance, which can authoritatively define the faith. Most denominations share common beliefs in the major aspects of the Christian faith while differing in many secondary doctrines, although what is major and what is secondary is a matter of idiosyncratic belief. Several countries have established their national churches, linking the ecclesiastical structure with the state. Jurisdictions where a Protestant denomination has been established as a state religion include several Nordic countries; Denmark (including Greenland),Denmark ‚Äì Constitution: Section 4 State Church, International Constitutional Law. the Faroe Islands (its church being independent since 2007), IcelandConstitution of the Republic of Iceland: Article 62, Government of Iceland. and NorwayL√∏sere b√•nd, men fortsatt statskirke , ABC NyheterStaten skal ikke lenger ansette biskoper, NRK have established Evangelical Lutheran churches. Tuvalu has the only established church in Reformed tradition in the world, while Tonga‚Äîin the Methodist tradition. The Church of England is the officially established religious institution in England, and also the Mother Church of the worldwide Anglican Communion. In 1869, Finland was the first Nordic country to disestablish its Evangelical Lutheran church by introducing the Church Act. Although the church still maintains a special relationship with the state, it is not described as a state religion in the Finnish Constitution or other laws passed by the Finnish Parliament.Finland ‚Äì Constitution, Section 76 The Church Act, http://servat.unibe.ch/icl/fi00000_.html. In 2000, Sweden was the second Nordic country to do so. United and uniting churches Glass window in the town church of Wiesloch (Stadtkirche Wiesloch) with Martin Luther and John Calvin commemorating the 1821 union of Lutheran and Reformed churches in the Grand Duchy of Baden. United and uniting churches are churches formed from the merger or other form of union of two or more different Protestant denominations. Historically, unions of Protestant churches were enforced by the state, usually in order to have a stricter control over the religious sphere of its people, but also other organizational reasons. As modern Christian ecumenism progresses, unions between various Protestant traditions are becoming more and more common, resulting in a growing number of united and uniting churches. Some of the recent major examples are the United Protestant Church of France (2013) and the Protestant Church in the Netherlands (2004). As mainline Protestantism shrinks in Europe and North America due to the rise of secularism, Reformed and Lutheran denominations merge, often creating large nationwide denominations. The phenomenon is much less common among evangelical, nondenominational and charismatic churches as new ones arise and plenty of them remain independent of each other. Perhaps the oldest official united church is found in Germany, where the Evangelical Church in Germany is a federation of Lutheran, United (Prussian Union) and Reformed churches, a union dating back to 1817. The first of the series of unions was at a synod in Idstein to form the Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau in August 1817, commemorated in naming the church of Idstein Unionskirche one hundred years later. Around the world, each united or uniting church comprises a different mix of predecessor Protestant denominations. Trends are visible, however, as most united and uniting churches have one or more predecessors with heritage in the Reformed tradition and many are members of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches. Major branches Protestants can be differentiated according to how they have been influenced by important movements since the Reformation, today regarded as branches. Some of these movements have a common lineage, sometimes directly spawning individual denominations. Due to the earlier stated multitude of denominations, this section discusses only the largest denominational families, or branches, widely considered to be a part of Protestantism. These are, in alphabetical order: Adventist, Anglican, Baptist, Calvinist (Reformed), Lutheran, Methodist and Pentecostal. A small but historically significant Anabaptist branch is also discussed. The chart below shows the mutual relations and historical origins of the main Protestant denominational families, or their parts. Due to factors such as Counter- Reformation and the legal principle of Cuius regio, eius religio, many people lived as Nicodemites, where their professed religious affiliations were more or less at odds with the movement they sympathized with. As a result, the boundaries between the denominations do not separate as cleanly as this chart indicates. When a population was suppressed or persecuted into feigning an adherence to the dominant faith, over the generations they continued to influence the church they outwardly adhered to. Because Calvinism was not specifically recognized in the Holy Roman Empire until the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, many Calvinists lived as Crypto-Calvinists. Due to Counter- Reformation related suppressions in Catholic lands during the 16th through 19th centuries, many Protestants lived as Crypto-Protestants. Meanwhile, in Protestant areas, Catholics sometimes lived as crypto-papists, although in continental Europe emigration was more feasible so this was less common. Historical chart of the main Protestant branches. Adventism Adventism began in the 19th century in the context of the Second Great Awakening revival in the United States. The name refers to belief in the imminent Second Coming (or \\"Second Advent\\") of Jesus Christ. William Miller started the Adventist movement in the 1830s. His followers became known as Millerites. Although the Adventist churches hold much in common, their theologies differ on whether the intermediate state is unconscious sleep or consciousness, whether the ultimate punishment of the wicked is annihilation or eternal torment, the nature of immortality, whether or not the wicked are resurrected after the millennium, and whether the sanctuary of refers to the one in heaven or one on earth. The movement has encouraged the examination of the whole Bible, leading Seventh- day Adventists and some smaller Adventist groups to observe the Sabbath. The General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists has compiled that church's core beliefs in the 28 Fundamental Beliefs (1980 and 2005), which use Biblical references as justification. In 2010, Adventism claimed some 22 million believers scattered in various independent churches. The largest church within the movement‚Äîthe Seventh-day Adventist Church‚Äîhas more than 18 million members. File:James and Ellen White.jpgJames Springer White and his wife, Ellen G.

Anabaptism Anabaptism traces its origins to the Radical Reformation. Anabaptists believe in delaying baptism until the candidate confesses his or her faith. Although some consider this movement to be an offshoot of Protestantism, others see it as a distinct one.. The Amish, Hutterites, and Mennonites are direct descendants of the movement. Schwarzenau Brethren, Bruderhof, and the Apostolic Christian Church are considered later developments among the Anabaptists. The name Anabaptist, meaning \\"one who baptizes again\\", was given them by their persecutors in reference to the practice of re-baptizing converts who already had been baptized as infants.. Anabaptists required that baptismal candidates be able to make their own confessions of faith and so rejected baptism of infants. The early members of this movement did not accept the name Anabaptist, claiming that since infant baptism was unscriptural and null and void, the baptizing of believers was not a re-baptism but in fact their first real baptism. As a result of their views on the nature of baptism and other issues, Anabaptists were heavily persecuted during the 16th century and into the 17th by both Magisterial Protestants and Catholics.Since the middle of the 20th century, the German-speaking world no longer uses the term \\"Wiedert√§ufer\\" (translation: \\"Re-baptizers\\") considering it biased. The term \\"T√§ufer\\" (translation: \\"Baptizers\\") is now used, which is considered more impartial. From the perspective of their persecutors, the \\"Baptizers\\" baptized for the second time those \\"who as infants had already been baptized\\". Since the denigrative term Anabaptist signifies re-baptizing, it is considered a polemic term and therefore has been dropped from use in modern German. However, in the English- speaking world it is still in use in order to distinguish the \\"Baptizers\\" more clearly from the \\"Baptists\\" who emerged later. While most Anabaptists adhered to a literal interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount, which precluded taking oaths, participating in military actions, and participating in civil government, some who practiced re-baptism felt otherwise.For example, the followers of Thomas M√ºntzer and Balthasar Hubmaier. They were thus technically Anabaptists, even though conservative Amish, Mennonites, and Hutterites and some historians tend to consider them as outside of true Anabaptism. Anabaptist reformers of the Radical Reformation are divided into Radical and the so-called Second Front. Some important Radical Reformation theologians were John of Leiden, Thomas M√ºntzer, Kaspar Schwenkfeld, Sebastian Franck, Menno Simons. Second Front Reformers included Hans Denck, Conrad Grebel, Balthasar Hubmaier and Felix Manz. Many Anabaptists today still use the Ausbund, which is the oldest hymnal still in continuous use.

Anglicanism Anglicanism comprises the Church of England and churches which are historically tied to it or hold similar beliefs, worship practices and church structures. The word Anglican originates in ', a medieval Latin phrase dating to at least 1246 that means the English Church. There is no single \\"Anglican Church\\" with universal juridical authority, since each national or regional church has full autonomy. As the name suggests, the communion is an association of churches in full communion with the Archbishop of Canterbury. The great majority of Anglicans are members of churches which are part of the international Anglican Communion, which has 85 million adherents. The Church of England declared its independence from the Catholic Church at the time of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement. Many of the new Anglican formularies of the mid-16th century corresponded closely to those of contemporary Reformed tradition. These reforms were understood by one of those most responsible for them, the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, as navigating a middle way between two of the emerging Protestant traditions, namely Lutheranism and Calvinism.Diarmaid MacCulloch, Thomas Cranmer: A Life, Yale University Press, p.617 (1996). By the end of the century, the retention in Anglicanism of many traditional liturgical forms and of the episcopate was already seen as unacceptable by those promoting the most developed Protestant principles. Unique to Anglicanism is the Book of Common Prayer, the collection of services that worshippers in most Anglican churches used for centuries. While it has since undergone many revisions and Anglican churches in different countries have developed other service books, the Book of Common Prayer is still acknowledged as one of the ties that bind the Anglican Communion together.

File:Westminster abbey west.jpgBritish coronations are held in Westminster Abbey, a royal peculiar under the direct jurisdiction of the monarch. Baptists Baptists subscribe to a doctrine that baptism should be performed only for professing believers (believer's baptism, as opposed to infant baptism), and that it must be done by complete immersion (as opposed to affusion or sprinkling). Other tenets of Baptist churches include soul competency (liberty), salvation through faith alone, Scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice, and the autonomy of the local congregation. Baptists recognize two ministerial offices, pastors and deacons. Baptist churches are widely considered to be Protestant churches, though some Baptists disavow this identity.Buescher, John. \\"Baptist Origins.\\" Teaching History. Retrieved 23 September 2011. Diverse from their beginning, those identifying as Baptists today differ widely from one another in what they believe, how they worship, their attitudes toward other Christians, and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship. Historians trace the earliest church labeled Baptist back to 1609 in Amsterdam, with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor.Gourley, Bruce. \\"A Very Brief Introduction to Baptist History, Then and Now.\\" The Baptist Observer. In accordance with his reading of the New Testament, he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults. Baptist practice spread to England, where the General Baptists considered Christ's atonement to extend to all people, while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect. In 1638, Roger Williams established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies. In the mid-18th century, the First Great Awakening increased Baptist growth in both New England and the South.\\"Baptist.\\" 2010. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. The Second Great Awakening in the South in the early 19th century increased church membership, as did the preachers' lessening of support for abolition and manumission of slavery, which had been part of the 18th-century teachings. Baptist missionaries have spread their church to every continent. The Baptist World Alliance reports more than 41 million members in more than 150,000 congregations. In 2002, there were over 100 million Baptists and Baptistic group members worldwide and over 33 million in North America. The largest Baptist association is the Southern Baptist Convention, with the membership of associated churches totaling more than 14 million.

File:Baptism by immersion.jpgBaptists subscribe to a doctrine that baptism should be performed only for professing believers. File:First Baptist Meetinghouse, Providence, RI.jpgThe First Baptist Church in America. Baptists are roughly one-third of U.S. Protestants. Calvinism Calvinism, also called the Reformed tradition, was advanced by several theologians such as Martin Bucer, Heinrich Bullinger, Peter Martyr Vermigli, and Huldrych Zwingli, but this branch of Christianity bears the name of the French reformer John Calvin because of his prominent influence on it and because of his role in the confessional and ecclesiastical debates throughout the 16th century. Today, this term also refers to the doctrines and practices of the Reformed churches of which Calvin was an early leader. Less commonly, it can refer to the individual teaching of Calvin himself. The particulars of Calvinist theology may be stated in a number of ways. Perhaps the best known summary is contained in the five points of Calvinism, though these points identify the Calvinist view on soteriology rather than summarizing the system as a whole. Broadly speaking, Calvinism stresses the sovereignty or rule of God in all things‚Äîin salvation but also in all of life. This concept is seen clearly in the doctrines of predestination and total depravity. The biggest Reformed association is the World Communion of Reformed Churches with more than 80 million members in 211 member denominations around the world. There are more conservative Reformed federations like the World Reformed Fellowship and the International Conference of Reformed Churches, as well as independent churches.

File:First_Congregational_Church,_Cheshire_CT.jpgA Congregational church in Cheshire, Connecticut, United States. Lutheranism Lutheranism identifies with the theology of Martin Luther‚Äîa German monk and priest, ecclesiastical reformer, and theologian. Lutheranism advocates a doctrine of justification \\"by grace alone through faith alone on the basis of Scripture alone\\", the doctrine that scripture is the final authority on all matters of faith, rejecting the assertion made by Catholic leaders at the Council of Trent that authority comes from both Scriptures and Tradition.Canons and Decrees of the Council of Trent, Fourth Session, Decree on Sacred Scripture (Denzinger 783 [1501]; Schaff 2:79‚Äì81). For a history of the discussion of various interpretations of the Tridentine decree, see Selby, Matthew L., The Relationship Between Scripture and Tradition according to the Council of Trent, unpublished Master's thesis, University of St Thomas, July 2013. In addition, Lutherans accept the teachings of the first four ecumenical councils of the undivided Christian Church. Unlike the Reformed tradition, Lutherans retain many of the liturgical practices and sacramental teachings of the pre- Reformation Church, with a particular emphasis on the Eucharist, or Lord's Supper. Lutheran theology differs from Reformed theology in Christology, the purpose of God's Law, divine grace, the concept of perseverance of the saints, and predestination. Today, Lutheranism is one of the largest branches of Protestantism. With approximately 80 million adherents, it constitutes the third most common Protestant confession after historically Pentecostal denominations and Anglicanism. The Lutheran World Federation, the largest global communion of Lutheran churches represents over 72 million people. Both of these figures miscount Lutherans worldwide as many members of more generically Protestant LWF member church bodies do not self-identify as Lutheran or attend congregations that self-identify as Lutheran. Additionally, there are other international organizations such as the Global Confessional and Missional Lutheran Forum, International Lutheran Council and the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference, as well as Lutheran denominations that are not necessarily a member of an international organization.

Methodism Methodism identifies principally with the theology of John Wesley‚Äîan Anglican priest and evangelist. This evangelical movement originated as a revival within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate Church following Wesley's death. Because of vigorous missionary activity, the movement spread throughout the British Empire, the United States, and beyond, today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide. Originally it appealed especially to labourers and slaves. Soteriologically, most Methodists are Arminian, emphasizing that Christ accomplished salvation for every human being, and that humans must exercise an act of the will to receive it (as opposed to the traditional Calvinist doctrine of monergism). Methodism is traditionally low church in liturgy, although this varies greatly between individual congregations; the Wesleys themselves greatly valued the Anglican liturgy and tradition. Methodism is known for its rich musical tradition; John Wesley's brother, Charles, was instrumental in writing much of the hymnody of the Methodist Church, and many other eminent hymn writers come from the Methodist tradition.

Pentecostalism Pentecostalism is a movement that places special emphasis on a direct personal experience of God through the baptism with the Holy Spirit. The term Pentecostal is derived from Pentecost, the Greek name for the Jewish Feast of Weeks. For Christians, this event commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the followers of Jesus Christ, as described in the second chapter of the Book of Acts. This branch of Protestantism is distinguished by belief in the baptism with the Holy Spirit as an experience separate from conversion that enables a Christian to live a Holy Spirit‚Äìfilled and empowered life. This empowerment includes the use of spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues and divine healing‚Äîtwo other defining characteristics of Pentecostalism. Because of their commitment to biblical authority, spiritual gifts, and the miraculous, Pentecostals tend to see their movement as reflecting the same kind of spiritual power and teachings that were found in the Apostolic Age of the early church. For this reason, some Pentecostals also use the term Apostolic or Full Gospel to describe their movement. Pentecostalism eventually spawned hundreds of new denominations, including large groups such as the Assemblies of God and the Church of God in Christ, both in the United States and elsewhere. There are over 279 million Pentecostals worldwide, and the movement is growing in many parts of the world, especially the global South. Since the 1960s, Pentecostalism has increasingly gained acceptance from other Christian traditions, and Pentecostal beliefs concerning Spirit baptism and spiritual gifts have been embraced by non-Pentecostal Christians in Protestant and Catholic churches through the Charismatic Movement. Together, Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianity numbers over 500 million adherents.. File:Charlesparham.pngCharles Fox Parham, who associated glossolalia with the baptism in the Holy Spirit.

Other Protestants There are many other Protestant denominations that do not fit neatly into the mentioned branches, and are far smaller in membership. Some groups of individuals who hold basic Protestant tenets identify themselves simply as \\"Christians\\" or \\"born-again Christians\\". They typically distance themselves from the confessionalism or creedalism of other Christian communitiesConfessionalism is a term employed by historians to refer to \\"the creation of fixed identities and systems of beliefs for separate churches which had previously been more fluid in their self-understanding, and which had not begun by seeking separate identities for themselves‚Äîthey had wanted to be truly Catholic and reformed.\\" (MacCulloch, The Reformation: A History, p. xxiv.) by calling themselves \\"non-denominational\\" or \\"evangelical\\". Often founded by individual pastors, they have little affiliation with historic denominations. Hussitism follows the teachings of Czech reformer Jan Hus, who became the best-known representative of the Bohemian Reformation and one of the forerunners of the Protestant Reformation. An early hymnal was the hand- written Jistebnice hymn book. This predominantly religious movement was propelled by social issues and strengthened Czech national awareness. Among present-day Christians, Hussite traditions are represented in the Moravian Church, Unity of the Brethren, and the refounded Czechoslovak Hussite churches.Nƒïmec, Ludv√≠k \\"The Czechoslovak heresy and schism: the emergence of a national Czechoslovak church,\\" American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia, 1975, The Plymouth Brethren are a conservative, low church, evangelical movement, whose history can be traced to Dublin, Ireland, in the late 1820s, originating from Anglicanism. Among other beliefs, the group emphasizes '. Brethren generally see themselves not as a denomination, but as a network, or even as a collection of overlapping networks, of like-minded independent churches. Although the group refused for many years to take any denominational name to itself‚Äîa stance that some of them still maintain‚Äîthe title The Brethren, is one that many of their number are comfortable with in that the Bible designates all believers as brethren. The Holiness movement refers to a set of beliefs and practices emerging from 19th-century Methodism, and a number of evangelical denominations, parachurch organizations, and movements which emphasized those beliefs as a central doctrine. There are an estimated 12 million adherents in Holiness movement churches. The Salvation Army and The Wesleyan Church are notable examples. Quakers, or Friends, are members of a family of religious movements collectively known as the Religious Society of Friends. The central unifying doctrine of these movements is the priesthood of all believers. Many Friends view themselves as members of a Christian denomination. They include those with evangelical, holiness, liberal, and traditional conservative Quaker understandings of Christianity. Unlike many other groups that emerged within Christianity, the Religious Society of Friends has actively tried to avoid creeds and hierarchical structures.The Trouble With \\"Ministers\\" by Chuck Fager gives an overview of the hierarchy Friends had until it began to be abolished in the mid-eighteenth century. Retrieved 25 April 2014. Unitarianism is sometimes considered Protestant due to its origins in the Reformation and strong cooperation with other Protestants since the 16th century. It is excluded due to its Nontrinitarian theological nature. Unitarians can be regarded as Nontrinitarian Protestants, or simply Nontrinitarians. Unitarianism has been popular in the region of Transylvania within today's Romania, England, and the United States. It originated almost simultaneously in Transylvania and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Interdenominational movements Indonesian Reformed Evangelical Church megachurch There are also Christian movements which cross denominational lines and even branches, and cannot be classified on the same level previously mentioned forms. Evangelicalism is a prominent example. Some of those movements are active exclusively within Protestantism, some are Christian-wide. Transdenominational movements are sometimes capable of affecting parts of the Catholic Church, such as does it the Charismatic Movement, which aims to incorporate beliefs and practices similar to Pentecostals into the various branches of Christianity. Neo-charismatic churches are sometimes regarded as a subgroup of the Charismatic Movement. Both are put under a common label of Charismatic Christianity (so-called Renewalists), along with Pentecostals. Nondenominational churches and various house churches often adopt, or are akin to one of these movements. Megachurches are usually influenced by interdenominational movements. Globally, these large congregations are a significant development in Protestant Christianity. In the United States, the phenomenon has more than quadrupled in the past two decades. It has since spread worldwide. The chart below shows the mutual relations and historical origins of the main interdenominational movements and other developments within Protestantism. Links between interdenominational movements and other developments within Protestantism. Evangelicalism Evangelicalism, or evangelical Protestantism, is a worldwide, transdenominational movement which maintains that the essence of the gospel consists in the doctrine of salvation by grace through faith in Jesus Christ's atonement. Evangelicals are Christians who believe in the centrality of the conversion or \\"born again\\" experience in receiving salvation, believe in the authority of the Bible as God's revelation to humanity and have a strong commitment to evangelism or sharing the Christian message. It gained great momentum in the 18th and 19th centuries with the emergence of Methodism and the Great Awakenings in Britain and North America. The origins of Evangelicalism are usually traced back to the English Methodist movement, Nicolaus Zinzendorf, the Moravian Church, Lutheran pietism, Presbyterianism and Puritanism. Among leaders and major figures of the Evangelical Protestant movement were John Wesley, George Whitefield, Jonathan Edwards, Billy Graham, Harold John Ockenga, John Stott and Martyn Lloyd-Jones. There are an estimated 285,480,000 Evangelicals, corresponding to 13% of the Christian population and 4% of the total world population. The Americas, Africa and Asia are home to the majority of Evangelicals. The United States has the largest concentration of Evangelicals. Evangelicalism is gaining popularity both in and outside the English-speaking world, especially in Latin America and the developing world.

Charismatic movement Hillsong Church Konstanz, Germany, an evangelical charismatic church. The Charismatic movement is the international trend of historically mainstream congregations adopting beliefs and practices similar to Pentecostals. Fundamental to the movement is the use of spiritual gifts. Among Protestants, the movement began around 1960. In America, Episcopalian Dennis Bennett is sometimes cited as one of the charismatic movement's seminal influence.. In the United Kingdom, Colin Urquhart, Michael Harper, David Watson and others were in the vanguard of similar developments. The Massey conference in New Zealand, 1964 was attended by several Anglicans, including the Rev. Ray Muller, who went on to invite Bennett to New Zealand in 1966, and played a leading role in developing and promoting the Life in the Spirit seminars. Other Charismatic movement leaders in New Zealand include Bill Subritzky. Larry Christenson, a Lutheran theologian based in San Pedro, California, did much in the 1960s and 1970s to interpret the charismatic movement for Lutherans. A very large annual conference regarding that matter was held in Minneapolis. Charismatic Lutheran congregations in Minnesota became especially large and influential; especially \\"Hosanna!\\" in Lakeville, and North Heights in St. Paul. The next generation of Lutheran charismatics cluster around the Alliance of Renewal Churches. There is considerable charismatic activity among young Lutheran leaders in California centered around an annual gathering at Robinwood Church in Huntington Beach. Richard A. Jensen's Touched by the Spirit published in 1974, played a major role of the Lutheran understanding to the charismatic movement. In Congregational and Presbyterian churches which profess a traditionally Calvinist or Reformed theology there are differing views regarding present-day continuation or cessation of the gifts (') of the Spirit. Generally, however, Reformed charismatics distance themselves from renewal movements with tendencies which could be perceived as overemotional, such as Word of Faith, Toronto Blessing, Brownsville Revival and Lakeland Revival. Prominent Reformed charismatic denominations are the Sovereign Grace Churches and the Every Nation Churches in the US, in Great Britain there is the Newfrontiers churches and movement, which leading figure is Terry Virgo. A minority of Seventh-day Adventists today are charismatic. They are strongly associated with those holding more \\"progressive\\" Adventist beliefs. In the early decades of the church charismatic or ecstatic phenomena were commonplace. Neo-charismatic churches Neo-charismatic churches are a category of churches in the Christian Renewal movement. Neo-charismatics include the Third Wave, but are broader. Now more numerous than Pentecostals (first wave) and charismatics (second wave) combined, owing to the remarkable growth of postdenominational and independent charismatic groups.. Neo-charismatics believe in and stress the post-Biblical availability of gifts of the Holy Spirit, including glossolalia, healing, and prophecy. They practice laying on of hands and seek the \\"infilling\\" of the Holy Spirit. However, a specific experience of baptism with the Holy Spirit may not be requisite for experiencing such gifts. No single form, governmental structure, or style of church service characterizes all neo-charismatic services and churches. Some nineteen thousand denominations, with approximately 295 million individual adherents, are identified as neo-charismatic.. Neo-charismatic tenets and practices are found in many independent, nondenominational or post-denominational congregations, with strength of numbers centered in the African independent churches, among the Han Chinese house-church movement, and in Latin American churches. Other Protestant developments A plenty of other movements and thoughts to be distinguished from the widespread transdenominational ones and branches appeared within Protestant Christianity. Some of them are also in evidence today. Others appeared during the centuries following the Reformation and disappeared gradually with the time, such as much of Pietism. Some inspired the current transdenominational ones, such as Evangelicalism which has its foundation in the Christian fundamentalism. Arminianism Jacobus Arminius was a Dutch Reformed theologian, whose views influenced parts of Protestantism. A small Remonstrant community remains in the Netherlands. Arminianism is based on theological ideas of the Dutch Reformed theologian Jacobus Arminius (1560‚Äì1609) and his historic supporters known as Remonstrants. His teachings held to the five solae of the Reformation, but they were distinct from particular teachings of Martin Luther, Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin, and other Protestant Reformers. Jacobus Arminius was a student of Theodore Beza at the Theological University of Geneva. Arminianism is known to some as a soteriological diversification of Calvinism.\\"Chambers Biographical Dictionary,\\" ed. Magnus Magnusson (Chambers: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 62. However, to others, Arminianism is a reclamation of early Church theological consensus.Kenneth D. Keathley, \\"The Work of God: Salvation,\\" in A Theology for the Church, ed. Daniel L. Akin (Nashville: B&H; Academic, 2007), 703. Dutch Arminianism was originally articulated in the Remonstrance (1610), a theological statement signed by 45 ministers and submitted to the States General of the Netherlands. Many Christian denominations have been influenced by Arminian views on the will of man being freed by grace prior to regeneration, notably the Baptists in the 16th century,Robert G. Torbet, A History of the Baptists, third edition the Methodists in the 18th century and the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the 19th century. The original beliefs of Jacobus Arminius himself are commonly defined as Arminianism, but more broadly, the term may embrace the teachings of Hugo Grotius, John Wesley, and others as well. Classical Arminianism and Wesleyan Arminianism are the two main schools of thought. Wesleyan Arminianism is often identical with Methodism. The two systems of Calvinism and Arminianism share both history and many doctrines, and the history of Christian theology. However, because of their differences over the doctrines of divine predestination and election, many people view these schools of thought as opposed to each other. In short, the difference can be seen ultimately by whether God allows His desire to save all to be resisted by an individual's will (in the Arminian doctrine) or if God's grace is irresistible and limited to only some (in Calvinism). Some Calvinists assert that the Arminian perspective presents a synergistic system of Salvation and therefore is not only by grace, while Arminians firmly reject this conclusion. Many consider the theological differences to be crucial differences in doctrine, while others find them to be relatively minor.Gonzalez, Justo L. The Story of Christianity, Vol. Two: The Reformation to the Present Day (New York: Harpercollins Publishers, 1985; reprint ‚Äì Peabody: Prince Press, 2008) 180 Pietism Pietism was an influential movement within Lutheranism that combined the 17th-century Lutheran principles with the Reformed emphasis on individual piety and living a vigorous Christian life.In places, such as parts of England and America, where Pietism was frequently juxtaposed with Catholicism, Catholics also became naturally influenced by Pietism, helping to foster a stronger tradition of congregational hymn-singing, including among Pietists who converted to Catholicism and brought their pietistic inclination with them, such as Frederick William Faber. It began in the late 17th century, reached its zenith in the mid-18th century, and declined through the 19th century, and had almost vanished in America by the end of the 20th century. While declining as an identifiable Lutheran group, some of its theological tenets influenced Protestantism generally, inspiring the Anglican priest John Wesley to begin the Methodist movement and Alexander Mack to begin the Brethren movement among Anabaptists. Though Pietism shares an emphasis on personal behavior with the Puritan movement, and the two are often confused, there are important differences, particularly in the concept of the role of religion in government.Calvinist Puritans believed that government was ordained by God to enforce Christian behavior upon the world; pietists see the government as a part of the world, and believers were called to voluntarily live faithful lives independent of government.

Puritanism, English dissenters and nonconformists The Puritans were a group of English Protestants in the 16th and 17th centuries, which sought to purify the Church of England of what they considered to be Catholic practices, maintaining that the church was only partially reformed. Puritanism in this sense was founded by some of the returning clergy exiled under Mary I shortly after the accession of Elizabeth I of England in 1558, as an activist movement within the Church of England. Puritans were blocked from changing the established church from within, and were severely restricted in England by laws controlling the practice of religion. Their beliefs, however, were transported by the emigration of congregations to the Netherlands (and later to New England), and by evangelical clergy to Ireland (and later into Wales), and were spread into lay society and parts of the educational system, particularly certain colleges of the University of Cambridge. The first Protestant sermon delivered in England was in Cambridge, with the pulpit that this sermon was delivered from surviving to today. They took on distinctive beliefs about clerical dress and in opposition to the episcopal system, particularly after the 1619 conclusions of the Synod of Dort they were resisted by the English bishops. They largely adopted Sabbatarianism in the 17th century, and were influenced by millennialism. They formed, and identified with various religious groups advocating greater purity of worship and doctrine, as well as personal and group piety. Puritans adopted a Reformed theology, but they also took note of radical criticisms of Zwingli in Zurich and Calvin in Geneva. In church polity, some advocated for separation from all other Christians, in favor of autonomous gathered churches. These separatist and independent strands of Puritanism became prominent in the 1640s, when the supporters of a Presbyterian polity in the Westminster Assembly were unable to forge a new English national church. Nonconforming Protestants along with the Protestant refugees from continental Europe were the primary founders of the United States of America.

Neo-orthodoxy and paleo-orthodoxy Karl Barth, often regarded as the greatest Protestant theologian of the twentieth century A non-fundamentalist rejection of liberal Christianity along the lines of the Christian existentialism of S√∏ren Kierkegaard, who attacked the Hegelian state churches of his day for \\"dead orthodoxy,\\" neo-orthodoxy is associated primarily with Karl Barth, J√ºrgen Moltmann, and Dietrich Bonhoeffer. Neo-orthodoxy sought to counter-act the tendency of liberal theology to make theological accommodations to modern scientific perspectives. Sometimes called \\"crisis theology,\\" in the existentialist sense of the word crisis, also sometimes called neo-evangelicalism, which uses the sense of \\"evangelical\\" pertaining to continental European Protestants rather than American evangelicalism. \\"Evangelical\\" was the originally preferred label used by Lutherans and Calvinists, but it was replaced by the names some Catholics used to label a heresy with the name of its founder. Paleo-orthodoxy is a movement similar in some respects to neo-evangelicalism but emphasizing the ancient Christian consensus of the undivided church of the first millennium AD, including in particular the early creeds and church councils as a means of properly understanding the scriptures. This movement is cross-denominational. A prominent theologian in this group is Thomas Oden, a Methodist. Christian fundamentalism In reaction to liberal Bible critique, fundamentalism arose in the 20th century, primarily in the United States, among those denominations most affected by Evangelicalism. Fundamentalist theology tends to stress Biblical inerrancy and Biblical literalism. Toward the end of the 20th century, some have tended to confuse evangelicalism and fundamentalism; however, the labels represent very distinct differences of approach that both groups are diligent to maintain, although because of fundamentalism's dramatically smaller size it often gets classified simply as an ultra- conservative branch of evangelicalism. Modernism and liberalism Modernism and liberalism do not constitute rigorous and well-defined schools of theology, but are rather an inclination by some writers and teachers to integrate Christian thought into the spirit of the Age of Enlightenment. New understandings of history and the natural sciences of the day led directly to new approaches to theology. Its opposition to the fundamentalist teaching resulted in religious debates, such as the Fundamentalist‚ÄìModernist Controversy within the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America in the 1920s. Protestant culture Although the Reformation was a religious movement, it also had a strong impact on all other aspects of life: marriage and family, education, the humanities and sciences, the political and social order, the economy, and the arts. Protestant churches reject the idea of a celibate priesthood and thus allow their clergy to marry. Many of their families contributed to the development of intellectual elites in their countries.Karl Heussi, ', p. 319 Since about 1950, women have entered the ministry, and some have assumed leading positions (e.g. bishops), in most Protestant churches. As the Reformers wanted all members of the church to be able to read the Bible, education on all levels got a strong boost. By the middle of the eighteenth century, the literacy rate in England was about 60 per cent, in Scotland 65 per cent, and in Sweden eight of ten men and women were able to read and to write.Heinrich August Winkler (2012), ', Third, Revised Edition, Munich (Germany), p. 233 Colleges and universities were founded. For example, the Puritans who established Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1628 founded Harvard College only eight years later. About a dozen other colleges followed in the 18th century, including Yale (1701). Pennsylvania also became a centre of learning.Clifton E. Olmstead (1960), History of Religion in the United States, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, pp. 69‚Äì80, 88‚Äì89, 114‚Äì117, 186‚Äì188M.

Auflage, Band III (1959), T√ºbingen (Germany), col. 1770 Members of mainline Protestant denominations have played leadership roles in many aspects of American life, including politics, business, science, the arts, and education. They founded most of the country's leading institutes of higher education.McKinney, William. \\"Mainline Protestantism 2000.\\" Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Vol. 558, Americans and Religions in the Twenty-First Century (July 1998), pp. 57‚Äì66. Thought and work ethic The Protestant concept of God and man allows believers to use all their God-given faculties, including the power of reason. That means that they are allowed to explore God's creation and, according to Genesis 2:15, make use of it in a responsible and sustainable way. Thus a cultural climate was created that greatly enhanced the development of the humanities and the sciences.Gerhard Lenski (1963), The Religious Factor: A Sociological Study of Religion's Impact on Politics, Economics, and Family Life, Revised Edition, A Doubleday Anchor Book, Garden City, New York, pp. 348‚Äì351 Another consequence of the Protestant understanding of man is that the believers, in gratitude for their election and redemption in Christ, are to follow God's commandments. Industry, frugality, calling, discipline, and a strong sense of responsibility are at the heart of their moral code.Cf. Robert Middlekauff (2005), The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763‚Äì1789, Revised and Expanded Edition, Oxford University Press, , p. 52Jan Weerda, ', in ', 3. Auflage (1958), Stuttgart (Germany), col. 934 In particular, Calvin rejected luxury. Therefore, craftsmen, industrialists, and other businessmen were able to reinvest the greater part of their profits in the most efficient machinery and the most modern production methods that were based on progress in the sciences and technology. As a result, productivity grew, which led to increased profits and enabled employers to pay higher wages. In this way, the economy, the sciences, and technology reinforced each other. The chance to participate in the economic success of technological inventions was a strong incentive to both inventors and investors.Eduard Heimann, Kapitalismus, in Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart, 3. Auflage, Band III (1959), T√ºbingen (Germany), col. 1136‚Äì1141Hans Fritz Schwenkhagen, Technik, in Evangelisches Soziallexikon, 3. Auflage, col. 1029‚Äì1033Georg S√º√ümann, ', in ', 3.

This idea is also known as the \\"Protestant ethic thesis.\\" However, eminent historian Fernand Braudel (d. 1985), a leader of the important Annales School wrote: \\"all historians have opposed this tenuous theory [the Protestant Ethic], although they have not managed to be rid of it once and for all. Yet it is clearly false. The northern countries took over the place that earlier had been so long and brilliantly been occupied by the old capitalist centers of the Mediterranean. They invented nothing, either in technology or business management.\\"Braudel, Fernand. 1977. Afterthoughts on Material Civilization and Capitalism. Baltimore: Johns Hopskins University Press. Social scientist Rodney Stark moreover comments that \\"during their critical period of economic development, these northern centers of capitalism were Catholic, not Protestant‚Äîthe Reformation still lay well into the future,\\" while British historian Hugh Trevor-Roper (d. 2003) said, \\"The idea that large-scale industrial capitalism was ideologically impossible before the Reformation is exploded by the simple fact that it existed.\\"Trevor-Roper. 2001. The Crisis of the Seventeenth Century. Liberty Fund In a factor analysis of the latest wave of World Values Survey data, Arno Tausch (Corvinus University of Budapest) found that Protestantism emerges to be very close to combining religion and the traditions of liberalism. The Global Value Development Index, calculated by Tausch, relies on the World Values Survey dimensions such as trust in the state of law, no support for shadow economy, postmaterial activism, support for democracy, a non-acceptance of violence, xenophobia and racism, trust in transnational capital and Universities, confidence in the market economy, supporting gender justice, and engaging in environmental activism, etc. Episcopalians and Presbyterians, as well as other WASPs, tend to be considerably wealthier and better educated (having graduate and post-graduate degrees per capita) than most other religious groups in United States,Irving Lewis Allen, \\"WASP ‚Äì From Sociological Concept to Epithet,\\" Ethnicity, 1975 154+ and are disproportionately represented in the upper reaches of American business, law and politics, especially the Republican Party. Numbers of the most wealthy and affluent American families as the Vanderbilts and the Astors, Rockefeller, Du Pont, Roosevelt, Forbes, Whitneys, the Morgans and Harrimans are Mainline Protestant families. Science Columbia University, established by the Church of England. Protestantism has had an important influence on science. According to the Merton Thesis, there was a positive correlation between the rise of English Puritanism and German Pietism on the one hand and early experimental science on the other.Sztompka, 2003 The Merton Thesis has two separate parts: Firstly, it presents a theory that science changes due to an accumulation of observations and improvement in experimental technique and methodology; secondly, it puts forward the argument that the popularity of science in 17th-century England and the religious demography of the Royal Society (English scientists of that time were predominantly Puritans or other Protestants) can be explained by a correlation between Protestantism and the scientific values.Gregory, 1998 Merton focused on English Puritanism and German Pietism as having been responsible for the development of the scientific revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries. He explained that the connection between religious affiliation and interest in science was the result of a significant synergy between the ascetic Protestant values and those of modern science.Becker, 1992 Protestant values encouraged scientific research by allowing science to identify God's influence on the world‚Äîhis creation‚Äîand thus providing a religious justification for scientific research. According to Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States by Harriet Zuckerman, a review of American Nobel prizes awarded between 1901 and 1972, 72% of American Nobel Prize laureates identified a Protestant background.Harriet Zuckerman, Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States New York, The Free Press, 1977, p. 68: Protestants turn up among the American-reared laureates in slightly greater proportion to their numbers in the general population. Thus 72 percent of the seventy-one laureates but about two-thirds of the American population were reared in one or another Protestant denomination-) Overall, 84% of all the Nobel Prizes awarded to Americans in Chemistry, 60% in Medicine, and 59% in Physics between 1901 and 1972 were won by Protestants. According to 100 Years of Nobel Prize (2005), a review of Nobel prizes awarded between 1901 and 2000, 65% of Nobel Prize Laureates, have identified Christianity in its various forms as their religious preference (423 prizes).Baruch A. Shalev, 100 Years of Nobel Prizes (2003), Atlantic Publishers & Distributors, p. 57: between 1901 and 2000 reveals that 654 Laureates belong to 28 different religion Most 65% have identified Christianity in its various forms as their religious preference. While separating Catholics from Protestants among Christians proved difficult in some cases, available information suggests that more Protestants were involved in the scientific categories and more Catholics were involved in the Literature and Peace categories. Atheists, agnostics, and freethinkers comprise 11% of total Nobel Prize winners; but in the category of Literature, these preferences rise sharply to about 35%. A striking fact involving religion is the high number of Laureates of the Jewish faith‚Äîover 20% of total Nobel Prizes (138); including: 17% in Chemistry, 26% in Medicine and Physics, 40% in Economics and 11% in Peace and Literature each. The numbers are especially startling in light of the fact that only some 14 million people (0.02% of the world's population) are Jewish. By contrast, only 5 Nobel Laureates have been of the Muslim faith‚Äî1% of total number of Nobel prizes awarded‚Äîfrom a population base of about 1.2 billion (20% of the world's population) While 32% have identified with Protestantism in its various forms (208 prizes), although Protestant comprise 12% to 13% of the world's population. Government In the Middle Ages, the Church and the worldly authorities were closely related. Martin Luther separated the religious and the worldly realms in principle (doctrine of the two kingdoms).Heinrich Bornkamm, ' in ', 3. Auflage, Band VI (1962), col. 937 The believers were obliged to use reason to govern the worldly sphere in an orderly and peaceful way. Luther's doctrine of the priesthood of all believers upgraded the role of laymen in the church considerably. The members of a congregation had the right to elect a minister and, if necessary, to vote for his dismissal (Treatise On the right and authority of a Christian assembly or congregation to judge all doctrines and to call, install and dismiss teachers, as testified in Scripture; 1523).Original German title: ' Calvin strengthened this basically democratic approach by including elected laymen (church elders, presbyters) in his representative church government.Clifton E. Olmstead, History of Religion in the United States, pp. 4‚Äì10 The Huguenots added regional synods and a national synod, whose members were elected by the congregations, to Calvin's system of church self-government. This system was taken over by the other reformed churchesKarl Heussi, ', 11. Auflage, p. 325 and was adopted by some Lutherans beginning with those in J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg during the 17th century. Politically, Calvin favoured a mixture of aristocracy and democracy. He appreciated the advantages of democracy: \\"It is an invaluable gift, if God allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords.\\"Quoted in Jan Weerda, Calvin, in ', 3. Auflage (1958), Stuttgart (Germany), col. 210 Calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against God. To further protect the rights of ordinary people, Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances (separation of powers). Thus he and his followers resisted political absolutism and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy.Clifton E. Olmstead, History of Religion in the United States, p. 10 Besides England, the Netherlands were, under Calvinist leadership, the freest country in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It granted asylum to philosophers like Baruch Spinoza and Pierre Bayle. Hugo Grotius was able to teach his natural-law theory and a relatively liberal interpretation of the Bible.Karl Heussi, ', pp. 396‚Äì397 Consistent with Calvin's political ideas, Protestants created both the English and the American democracies. In seventeenth-century England, the most important persons and events in this process were the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell, John Milton, John Locke, the Glorious Revolution, the English Bill of Rights, and the Act of Settlement.Cf. M. Schmidt, ', in ', 3. Auflage, Band II (1959), T√ºbingen (Germany), col. 476‚Äì478 Later, the British took their democratic ideals to their colonies, e.g. Australia, New Zealand, and India. In North America, Plymouth Colony (Pilgrim Fathers; 1620) and Massachusetts Bay Colony (1628) practised democratic self-rule and separation of powers.Nathaniel Philbrick (2006), Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War, Penguin Group, New York, Clifton E. Olmstead, History of Religion in the United States, pp. 65‚Äì76Christopher Fennell (1998), Plymouth Colony Legal Structure These Congregationalists were convinced that the democratic form of government was the will of God.M.

Protestants also took the initiative in advocating for religious freedom. Freedom of conscience had high priority on the theological, philosophical, and political agendas since Luther refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Worms (1521). In his view, faith was a free work of the Holy Spirit and could, therefore, not be forced on a person.Clifton E. Olmstead, History of Religion in the United States, p. 5 The persecuted Anabaptists and Huguenots demanded freedom of conscience, and they practised separation of church and state.Heinrich Bornkamm, ', in ', 3. Auflage, Band VI (1962), col. 937‚Äì938 In the early seventeenth century, Baptists like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys published tracts in defense of religious freedom.H. Stahl, ', in ', 3.

All major Protestant churches were represented in the First and Second Continental Congresses.Clifton E. Olmstead, History of Religion in the United States, pp. 192‚Äì209 In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the American democracy became a model for numerous other countries and regions throughout the world (e.g., Latin America, Japan, and Germany). The strongest link between the American and French Revolutions was Marquis de Lafayette, an ardent supporter of the American constitutional principles. The French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen was mainly based on Lafayette's draft of this document.Cf. R. Voeltzel, ', in ', 3.

Some of the philosophers of the English, Scottish, German, and Swiss Enlightenment‚ÄîThomas Hobbes, John Locke, John Toland, David Hume, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Christian Wolff, Immanuel Kant, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau‚Äîhad Protestant backgrounds.Karl Heussi, ', 11. Auflage, pp. 396‚Äì399, 401‚Äì403, 417‚Äì419 For example, John Locke, whose political thought was based on \\"a set of Protestant Christian assumptions\\",Jeremy Waldron (2002), God, Locke, and Equality: Christian Foundations in Locke's Political Thought, Cambridge University Press, New York, , p. 13 derived the equality of all humans, including the equality of the genders (\\"Adam and Eve\\"), from Genesis 1, 26‚Äì28. As all persons were created equally free, all governments needed \\"the consent of the governed.\\"Jeremy Waldron, God, Locke, and Equality, pp. 21‚Äì43, 120 Also, other human rights were advocated for by some Protestants. For example, torture was abolished in Prussia in 1740, slavery in Britain in 1834 and in the United States in 1865 (William Wilberforce, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Abraham Lincoln ‚Äì against Southern Protestants).Allen Weinstein and David Rubel, The Story of America, pp. 189‚Äì309Karl Heussi, ', 11.

The Young Men's Christian Association was founded by Congregationalist George Williams, aimed at empowering young people. Arts The arts have been strongly inspired by Protestant beliefs. Martin Luther, Paul Gerhardt, George Wither, Isaac Watts, Charles Wesley, William Cowper, and many other authors and composers created well-known church hymns. Musicians like Heinrich Sch√ºtz, Johann Sebastian Bach, George Frideric Handel, Henry Purcell, Johannes Brahms, Philipp Nicolai and Felix Mendelssohn composed great works of music.

Catholic responses The view of the Catholic Church is that Protestant denominations cannot be considered churches but rather that they are ecclesial communities or specific faith- believing communities because their ordinances and doctrines are not historically the same as the Catholic sacraments and dogmas, and the Protestant communities have no sacramental ministerial priesthood and therefore lack true apostolic succession.Responses to Some Questions Regarding Certain Aspects of the Doctrine on the Church, 29 June 2007, Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. According to Bishop Hilarion (Alfeyev) the Eastern Orthodox Church shares the same view on the subject. Contrary to how the Protestant Reformers were often characterized, the concept of a catholic or universal Church was not brushed aside during the Protestant Reformation. On the contrary, the visible unity of the catholic or universal church was seen by the Protestant reformers as an important and essential doctrine of the Reformation. The Magisterial reformers, such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Huldrych Zwingli, believed that they were reforming the Catholic Church, which they viewed as having become corrupted. Each of them took very seriously the charges of schism and innovation, denying these charges and maintaining that it was the Catholic Church that had left them. The Protestant Reformers formed a new and radically different theological opinion on ecclesiology, that the visible Church is \\"catholic\\" (lower-case \\"c\\") rather than \\"Catholic\\" (upper-case \\"C\\"). Accordingly, there is not an indefinite number of parochial, congregational or national churches, constituting, as it were, so many ecclesiastical individualities, but one great spiritual republic of which these various organizations form a part, although they each have very different opinions. This was markedly far-removed from the traditional and historic Catholic understanding that the Roman Catholic Church was the one true Church of Christ. Yet in the Protestant understanding, the visible church is not a genus, so to speak, with so many species under it. In order to justify their departure from the Catholic Church, Protestants often posited a new argument, saying that there was no real visible Church with divine authority, only a spiritual, invisible, and hidden church‚Äîthis notion began in the early days of the Protestant Reformation. Wherever the Magisterial Reformation, which received support from the ruling authorities, took place, the result was a reformed national Protestant church envisioned to be a part of the whole invisible church, but disagreeing, in certain important points of doctrine and doctrine-linked practice, with what had until then been considered the normative reference point on such matters, namely the Papacy and central authority of the Catholic Church. The Reformed churches thus believed in some form of Catholicity, founded on their doctrines of the five solas and a visible ecclesiastical organization based on the 14th- and 15th- century Conciliar movement, rejecting the papacy and papal infallibility in favor of ecumenical councils, but rejecting the latest ecumenical council, the Council of Trent. Religious unity therefore became not one of doctrine and identity but one of invisible character, wherein the unity was one of faith in Jesus Christ, not common identity, doctrine, belief, and collaborative action. There are Protestants, especially of the Reformed tradition, that either reject or down-play the designation Protestant because of the negative idea that the word invokes in addition to its primary meaning, preferring the designation Reformed, Evangelical or even Reformed Catholic expressive of what they call a Reformed Catholicity and defending their arguments from the traditional Protestant confessions.The Canadian Reformed Magazine, 18 (20‚Äì27 September, 4‚Äì11 October, 18, 1, 8 November 1969) http://spindleworks.com/library/faber/008_theca.htm Ecumenism The ecumenical movement has had an influence on mainline churches, beginning at least in 1910 with the Edinburgh Missionary Conference. Its origins lay in the recognition of the need for cooperation on the mission field in Africa, Asia and Oceania. Since 1948, the World Council of Churches has been influential, but ineffective in creating a united church. There are also ecumenical bodies at regional, national and local levels across the globe; but schisms still far outnumber unifications. One, but not the only expression of the ecumenical movement, has been the move to form united churches, such as the Church of South India, the Church of North India, the US-based United Church of Christ, the United Church of Canada, the Uniting Church in Australia and the United Church of Christ in the Philippines which have rapidly declining memberships. There has been a strong engagement of Orthodox churches in the ecumenical movement, though the reaction of individual Orthodox theologians has ranged from tentative approval of the aim of Christian unity to outright condemnation of the perceived effect of watering down Orthodox doctrine. A Protestant baptism is held to be valid by the Catholic Church if given with the trinitarian formula and with the intent to baptize. However, as the ordination of Protestant ministers is not recognized due to the lack of apostolic succession and the disunity from Catholic Church, all other sacraments (except marriage) performed by Protestant denominations and ministers are not recognized as valid. Therefore, Protestants desiring full communion with the Catholic Church are not re-baptized (although they are confirmed) and Protestant ministers who become Catholics may be ordained to the priesthood after a period of study. In 1999, the representatives of Lutheran World Federation and Catholic Church signed the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification, apparently resolving the conflict over the nature of justification which was at the root of the Protestant Reformation, although Confessional Lutherans reject this statement. This is understandable, since there is no compelling authority within them. On 18 July 2006, delegates to the World Methodist Conference voted unanimously to adopt the Joint Declaration. Spread and demographics There are more than 900 million Protestants worldwide,Jay Diamond, Larry. Plattner, Marc F. and Costopoulos, Philip J. World Religions and Democracy. 2005, p. 119. link (saying \\"Not only do Protestants presently constitute 13 percent of the world's population‚Äîabout 800 million people‚Äîbut since 1900 Protestantism has spread rapidly in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.\\") among approximately 2.4 billion Christians.~34% of ~7.2 billion world population (under the section 'People') In 2010, a total of more than 800 million included 300 million in Sub-Saharan Africa, 260 million in the Americas, 140 million in Asia-Pacific region, 100 million in Europe and 2 million in Middle East-North Africa. Protestants account for nearly forty percent of Christians worldwide and more than one tenth of the total human population. Various estimates put the percentage of Protestants in relation to the total number of world's Christians at 33%, 36%,Protestant Demographics and Fragmentations 36.7%, and 40%, while in relation to the world's population at 11.6% and 13%. In European countries which were most profoundly influenced by the Reformation, Protestantism still remains the most practiced religion. These include the Nordic countries and the United Kingdom. In other historical Protestant strongholds such as Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Latvia, and Estonia, it remains one of the most popular religions. Although Czech Republic was the site of one of the most significant pre-reformation movements, there are only few Protestant adherents; mainly due to historical reasons like persecution of Protestants by the Catholic Habsburgs, restrictions during the Communist rule, and also the ongoing secularization. Over the last several decades, religious practice has been declining as secularization has increased. According to a 2019 study about Religiosity in the European Union in 2019 by Eurobarometer, Protestants made up 9% of the EU population. According to Pew Research Center, Protestants constituted nearly one fifth (or 18%) of the continent's Christian population in 2010. Clarke and Beyer estimate that Protestants constituted 15% of all Europeans in 2009, while Noll claims that less than 12% of them lived in Europe in 2010. Changes in worldwide Protestantism over the last century have been significant. Since 1900, Protestantism has spread rapidly in Africa, Asia, Oceania and Latin America. That caused Protestantism to be called a primarily non-Western religion. Much of the growth has occurred after World War II, when decolonization of Africa and abolition of various restrictions against Protestants in Latin American countries occurred. According to one source, Protestants constituted respectively 2.5%, 2%, 0.5% of Latin Americans, Africans and Asians. In 2000, percentage of Protestants on mentioned continents was 17%, more than 27% and 6%, respectively. According to Mark A. Noll, 79% of Anglicans lived in the United Kingdom in 1910, while most of the remainder was found in the United States and across the British Commonwealth. By 2010, 59% of Anglicans were found in Africa. In 2010, more Protestants lived in India than in the UK or Germany, while Protestants in Brazil accounted for as many people as Protestants in the UK and Germany combined. Almost as many lived in each of Nigeria and China as in all of Europe. China is home to world's largest Protestant minority. Protestantism is growing in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Oceania, while declining in Anglo AmericaAmerica's Changing Religious Landscape, by Pew Research Center, 12 May 2015 and Europe, with some exceptions such as France, where it was eradicated after the abolition of the Edict of Nantes by the Edict of Fontainebleau and the following persecution of Huguenots, but now is claimed to be stable in number or even growing slightly. According to some, Russia is another country to see a Protestant revival. In 2010, the largest Protestant denominational families were historically Pentecostal denominations (11%), Anglican (11%), Lutheran (10%), Baptist (9%), United and uniting churches (unions of different denominations) (7%), Presbyterian or Reformed (7%), Methodist (3%), Adventist (3%), Congregationalist (1%), Brethren (1%), The Salvation Army (<1%) and Moravian (<1%). Other denominations accounted for 38% of Protestants. United States is home to approximately 20% of Protestants. According to a 2012 study, Protestant share of U.S. population dropped to 48%, thus ending its status as religion of the majority for the first time.\\"Nones\\" on the Rise: One-in-Five Adults Have No Religious Affiliation , Pew Research Center (The Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life), 9 October 2012 The decline is attributed mainly to the dropping membership of the Mainline Protestant churches, while Evangelical Protestant and Black churches are stable or continue to grow. By 2050, Protestantism is projected to rise to slightly more than half of the world's total Christian population.Johnstone, Patrick, \\"The Future of the Global Church: History, Trends and Possibilities\\", p. 100, fig 4.10 & 4.11 According to other experts such as Hans J. Hillerbrand, Protestants will be as numerous as Catholics.Hillerbrand, Hans J., \\"Encyclopedia of Protestantism: 4-volume Set\\", p. 1815, \\"Observers carefully comparing all these figures in the total context will have observed the even more startling finding that for the first time ever in the history of Protestantism, Wider Protestants will by 2050 have become almost exactly as numerous as Catholics‚Äîeach with just over 1.5 billion followers, or 17 percent of the world, with Protestants growing considerably faster than Catholics each year.\\" According to Mark J√ºrgensmeyer of the University of California, popular Protestantism is the most dynamic religious movement in the contemporary world, alongside the resurgent Islam.

The concept of dividing humankind into three races called Caucasoid, Mongoloid, and Negroid (originally named \\"Ethiopian\\") was introduced in the 1780s by members of the G√∂ttingen School of History and further developed by Western scholars in the context of \\"racist ideologies\\" during the age of colonialism. With the rise of modern genetics, the concept of distinct human races in a biological sense has become obsolete. In 2019, the American Association of Physical Anthropologists stated: \\"The belief in ‚Äúraces‚Äù as natural aspects of human biology, and the structures of inequality (racism) that emerge from such beliefs, are among the most damaging elements in the human experience both today and in the past.\\"  Etymology  Negroid has both Spanish and Ancient Greek etymological roots. It literally translates as \\"black resemblance\\" from the Spanish word negro (black), and Greek ŒøŒµŒπŒ¥Œ≠œÇ -oeidƒìs, equivalent to -o- + ŒµŒØŒ¥ŒµœÇ -eidƒìs \\"having the appearance of\\", derivative of ŒµŒØŒ¥ŒøœÇ e√Ædos \\"appearance\\". The earliest recorded use of the term \\"Negroid\\" came in 1859.  History of the concept = Origins  Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, a scholar at the then modern G√∂ttingen University developed a concept dividing mankind into five races in the revised 1795 edition of his De generis humani varietate nativa (On the Natural Variety of Mankind). Although Blumenbach's concept later gave rise to scientific racism, his arguments were basically anti-racist, since he underlined that mankind as a whole forms one single species, and points out that the transition from one race to another is so gradual that the distinctions between the races presented by him are \\"very arbitrary\\".German: \\"sehr willk√ºrlich\\": Blumenbach counts the inhabitants of North Africa among the \\"Caucasian race\\", grouping the other Africans as \\"Ethiopian race\\". In this context, he names the \\"Abyssinians\\" and \\"Moors\\" as peoples through which the \\"Ethiopian race\\" gradually \\"flows together\\" with the \\"Caucasian race\\".German: \\"Aethiopische Rasse\\":  In the context of scientific racism  Before Darwin = The development of Western race theories took place in a historical situation where most Western nations were still profiting from the enslavement of Africans and therefore had an economical interest in portraying the inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africa as an inferior race. A significant change in Western views on Africans came about when Napoleon's 1798 invasion of Egypt drew attention to the impressive achievements of Ancient Egypt, which could hardly be reconciled with the theory of Africans being inferior. In this context, many of the works published on Egypt after Napoleon's expedition \\"seemed to have had as their main purpose an attempt to prove in some way that the Egyptians were not Negroes\\", but belonged to a \\"Hamitic race\\", which was seen as a subgroup of the \\"Caucasian race\\". Thus the high civilization of Ancient Egypt could be separated from the allegedly inferior African \\"race\\". Illustration of Negroid, Caucasoid, and Mongoloid skulls shown from above (Samuel George Morton, 1839)As historian Edith Sanders writes, \\"Perhaps because slavery was both still legal and profitable in the United States ... there arose an American school of anthropology which attempted to prove scientifically that the Egyptian was a Caucasian, far removed from the inferior Negro\\". In his Crania Aegyptiaca (1844), Samuel George Morton, the founder of anthropology in the United States, analyzed over a hundred intact crania gathered from the Nile Valley, and concluded that the ancient Egyptians were racially akin to Europeans. Discussions on race among Western scholars during the 19th century took place against the background of the debate between monogenists and polygenists, the former arguing for a single origin of all mankind, the latter holding that each human race had a specific origin. Monogenists based their arguments either on a literal interpretation of the biblical story of Adam and Eve or on secular research. Since polygenism stressed the perceived differences, it was popular among white supremacists, especially slaveholders in the US.Ibram X. Kendi, Stamped from the Beginning. The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America, New York: Nation Books 2016. , chapters 4, 7-12, 14, 16 passim. Through craniometry conducted on thousands of human skulls, Morton argued that the differences between the races were too broad to have stemmed from a single common ancestor, but were instead consistent with separate racial origins.Ibram X. Kendi, Stamped from the Beginning. The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America, New York: Nation Books 2016. , chapter 14. In Crania Aegyptiaca, he reported his measurements of internal skull capacity grouped according to Blumenbach's five races, finding that the average capacity of the \\"Caucasian race\\" was at the top, and that \\"Ethiopian\\" skulls had the smallest capacity, with the other \\"races\\" ranging in between.Michael, John S. ‚ÄúA New Look at Morton's Craniological Research.‚Äù Current Anthropology, vol. 29, no. 2, 1988, pp. 349‚Äì354. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2743412. Accessed 15 June 2020. He concluded that the \\"Ethiopian race\\" was inferior in terms of intelligence. Upon his death in 1851, when slavery still existed in the southern United States, the influential Charleston Medical Journal praised him with the words: \\"We of the South should consider him as our benefactor for aiding most materially in giving to the negro his true position as an inferior race.\\" and by: While a controversy about the correctness of Morton's measurements has been going on since the late 1970s, modern scientists agree that the volume of the skull and intelligence are not related.Mismeasure for mismeasure. Nature 474, 419 (2011). = In the age of evolutionary biology = Darwin's landmark work On the Origin of Species, published in 1859, 8 years after Morton's death, significantly changed scientific discourse on the origin of humans. British biologist Thomas Huxley, a strong advocate of Darwinism and a monogenist, counted 10 \\"modifications of mankind\\", dividing the native populations of sub-Saharan Africa into the \\"Bushmen\\" of the Cape region and the \\"Negroes\\" of the central areas of the continent.Huxley, T. H. On the Geographical Distribution of the Chief Modifications of Mankind (1870) Journal of the Ethnological Society of London. By the end of the 19th century, the influential German encyclopaedia, Meyers Konversations-Lexikon, divided humanity into three major races called Caucasoid, Mongoloid, and Negroid, each comprising various sub-races. While the \\"Hamites\\" of northern Africa were seen as Caucasoid, \\"Australians\\", \\"Melanesians\\", and \\"Negritoes\\" were seen as Negroid sub-races, although living outside the African continent. The only sub-races attributed to Africa were the \\"African Negroes\\" and the \\"Hottentots\\".The German legend of the map shows the following names: Hamiten, Australier, Melanesier, Negritos, Afrikanische Neger, Hottentotten.

Beach and Frank Morton McMurry In 1950, UNESCO published their statement The Race Question. It condemned all forms of racism, naming \\"the doctrine of inequality of men and races\\"\\"The Race Question\\", UNESCO, 1950, 11pp among the causes of World War II and proposing to replace the term \\"race\\" with \\"ethnic groups\\" because \\"serious errors ... are habitually committed when the term ‚Äúrace‚Äù is used in popular parlance\\". = Carleton Coon = American anthropologist Carleton S. Coon published his much debated Origin of Races in 1962. Coon divided the species Homo sapiens into five groups: Besides the Caucasoid, Mongoloid, and Australoid races, he posited two races among the indigenous populations of sub-Saharan Africa: the Capoid race in the south, and the Congoid race. In 1982, he used Negroid and Congoid as synonyms. Coon's thesis was that Homo erectus had already been divided into five different races or subspecies. \\"Homo Erectus then evolved into Homo Sapiens not once but five times, as each subspecies, living in its own territory, passed a critical threshold from a more brutal to a more sapient state.\\"Cited according to The reference given there is to \\"Coon, Origin of the [sic] Races, 1963 [sic], p. 657\\". He thought that the Caucasoid race had passed the threshold to Homo sapiens about 200,000 years earlier than the Negroid race, thus giving segregationists in the southern US the opportunity to make political use of his thesis in their fight against the civil rights movement. Although Coon publicly assumed a neutral stance regarding segregation, some fellow anthropologists accused him of being racist because of his \\"clear insensitivity to social issues\\". In private conversations and correspondence with his cousin Carleton Putnam, a prominent supporter of white supremacy, he went much further, helping Putnam \\"hone his arguments against integration\\". Coon's evolutionary approach was criticized on the basis that such sorting criteria generally do not produce meaningful results, and that evolutionary divergence was extremely improbable over the given time-frames. Monatagu (1963) argued that Coon's theory on the speciation of Congoids and other Homo sapiens was unlikely because the transmutation of one species to another was a markedly gradual process. Since Coon followed the traditional methods of physical anthropology, relying on morphological characteristics, and not on the emerging genetics to classify humans, the debate over Origin of Races has been \\"viewed as the last gasp of an outdated scientific methodology that was soon to be supplanted.\\"  Cheikh Anta Diop and \\"Negroid\\" primacy  Afrocentrist author Cheikh Anta Diop contrasted \\"Negroid\\" with \\"Cro-Magnoid\\" in his publications arguing for \\"Negroid\\" primacy. Grimaldi Man, Upper Paleolithic fossils found in Italy in 1901, had been classified as Negroid by Boule and Vallois (1921). The identification was obsolete by the 1960s, but was controversially revived by Diop (1989).Masset, C. (1989): Grimaldi : une imposture honn√™te et toujours jeune, Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© pr√©historique fran√ßaise, vol. 86, n¬∞ 8, pp. 228‚Äì243. \\"Cornevin seems to ignore the depth of morphological differences that exist between the Black and the White when he dates these differences back to Antiquity as recent as the eleventh millennium B.C. By doing so he opposes the one hypothesis at the disposal of scholars to confer upon the Whites an antiquity equal to that of the Blacks. He errs most regrettably in claiming that the Asselar man looks more like the Cro-Magnoid European of Grimladi and the Bushman than like modern Blacks. By definition, the Grimaldi Negorid is not Cro-Magnoid, and he is the only one the Asselar man could possibly resemble; he shares no feature with the so-called Cro-Magnon man who lived later in the same cave and is the prototype of the White race as the 'Negroid' is the prototype of the Black race.\\" C. A. Diop, The African Origin of Civilization: Myth Or Reality (1989), p. 266.  Physical features = General appearance  The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Eleventh Edition (1910‚Äì11) lists the following \\"well-defined characteristics\\" of the \\"Negroid\\" populations of Africa, southern India, Malaysia, and Australasia: \\"A dark skin, varying from dark brown, reddish- brown, or chocolate to nearly black; dark, tightly curled hair, flat in traverse section, of the woolly or the frizzly type; a greater or less tendency to prognathism; eyes dark brown with yellowish cornea; nose more or less broad and flat; and large teeth.\\" The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica sees a tendency towards a \\"tall stature\\" and \\"dolichocephaly\\" (long-headedness), with the exception of the Negritos who are described as showing \\"short stature\\" and \\"brachycephaly\\" (short-headedness). Forensic anthropologists writing around the turn of the millennium described \\"Negroid\\"A critical reflection on the use of \\"Negroid\\" and related terms in this context is given by: skulls as having a broad and round nasal cavity; no dam or nasal sill; Quonset hut-shaped nasal bones; notable facial projection in the jaw and mouth area (prognathism); a rectangular-shaped palate; a square or rectangular eye orbit shape; a large interorbital distance; a more undulating supraorbital ridge; and large teeth.Brace CL, Tracer DP, Yaroch LA, Robb J, Brandt K, Nelson AR, Clines and clusters versus \\"race:\\" a test in ancient Egypt and the case of a death on the Nile, (1993), Yrbk Phys Anthropol 36:1‚Äì31, p.18  Neoteny  Ashley Montagu lists \\"neotenous structural traits in which...Negroids [generally] differ from Caucasoids... flattish nose, flat root of the nose, narrower ears, narrower joints, frontal skull eminences, later closure of premaxillary sutures, less hairy, longer eyelashes, [and] cruciform pattern of second and third molars\\".Montagu, Ashley _Growing Young_ Published by Greenwood Publishing Group, 1988 He also suggested that in the extinct Negroid group termed the \\"Boskopoids\\", pedomorphic traits proceeded further than in other Negroids. Additionally, Montagu wrote that the Boskopoids had larger brains than modern humans (1,700 cubic centimeters cranial capacity compared to 1,400 cubic centimeters in modern-day humans), and the projection of their mouth was less than in other Negroids. He believed that the Boskopoids were the ancestors of the Khoisan.  Athleticism  In the context of prominent successes of African-American athletes like Jesse Owens during the 1936 Summer Olympics, the speed advantage of the \\"Negroid type of calf, foot and heel bone\\" was discussed.Cited in: Ibram X. Kendi, Stamped from the Beginning. The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America, New York: Nation Books 2016. , chapter 27. Black Anthropologist W. Montague Cobb joined the debate in the same year, pointing out that \\"there is not a single physical characteristic, including skin color, which all the Negro stars have in common which definitely classify them as Negroes.\\" Today, suggestions of biological differences in athletic ability between racial groups are considered unscientific.  Criticism  The Oxford Dictionary of English states: \\"The term Negroid belongs to a set of terms introduced by 19th-century anthropologists attempting to categorize human races. Such terms are associated with outdated notions of racial types, and so are now potentially offensive and best avoided\\". As of 2020, the same text was still present on the website:  Criticism based on modern genetics  In his 2016 essay Evolution and Notions of Human Race, Alan R. Templeton discusses various criteria used in biology to define subspecies or races. His examples for traits traditionally considered to be racial include skin colour: \\"[T]he native peoples with the darkest skins live in tropical Africa and Melanesia.\\" While those two groups would traditionally be classified as \\"black\\", in reality Africans are more closely related to Europeans than to Melanesians. Another example is malarial resistance, which is often found in African populations, but also in \\"many European and Asian populations\\". Templeton concludes: \\"[T]he answer to the question whether races exist in humans is clear and unambiguous: no.\\"Templeton, A. (2016). EVOLUTION AND NOTIONS OF HUMAN RACE. In Losos J. & Lenski R.

Typical profiles include straight cuts, mitres, saddles and midsection holes. These complex cuts are usually required to allow a tight fit between two parts that are to be joined via arc welding. Hot cutting Hot cutting is performed by means of a thermal torch (plasma or oxyfuel) and is mounted to the last axis of a multi-axis machine. The axes of the multi-axis machine are powered by electric motors and are synchronized to create a path for the torch and pipe that yield a desired profile. The synchronization of axes is accomplished either mechanically, via cams, levers and gears, or electronically, via microprocessors and controllers. Cold cutting Where the high temperatures and sources of ignition required by hot cutting are not desirable, air- or hydraulically-powered pipe cutting machines are used. These comprise a clamshell or chain-mounted cutting head holding a tool steel and feed mechanism which advances the tool a set amount per revolution round the pipe. Tools may be styled to cut and/or prepare the bevel for welding in a single or multiple passes. Popular in offshore, pipe processing, ship building, pressure vessel, structural and mechanical contracting manufacturing because of the complex cuts and profiles typical required in their respective industries. Some common pipe cutting applications are: pipe work, offshore jackets, industrial steel structures, stadiums, cranes, nozzles, and pipe laying stingers.

(Gibbons) Preston (September 29, 1842 ‚Äì March 26, 1910) was an American architect who practiced during the last third of the nineteenth century and in the first decade of the twentieth. Educated at Harvard University and the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris., he was active in Boston, New York, Rhode Island, Ohio, New Brunswick and Savannah Georgia where he was brought by George Johnson Baldwin to design the Chatham County courthouse. Preston stayed in Savannah for several years during which time designed the original Desoto Hotel (1890, demolished 1965), the Savannah Volunteer Guards Armory and 20 other distinguished public buildings and private homes. He began his professional career working for his father, the builder and architect Jonathan Preston (1801‚Äì1888), upon his return to the United States from the √âcole in 1861, and was the sole practitioner in the office from the time his father retired c. 1875 until he took John Kahlmeyer as a partner in about 1885. The drawings of the Preston firm, now owned by the Boston Public Library, make up \\"...one of the most complete sets of architectural graphics preserved from the nineteenth century.\\" Many of his buildings were pictured as prints in American Architect and Building News. He is credited with the introduction of the bungalow to the United States through a house loosely of the type that he designed in Monument Beach, Massachusetts in 1879. Preston was an early historic preservationist. He was influential in the successful 1896 effort to prevent the Massachusetts state legislature from demolishing Boston‚Äôs historic State House, which had been designed by the noted architect Charles Bulfinch and built in 1798. Bulfinch was also an architect of the Capitol building in Washington, D.C. Preston ran his practice for many years from a commercial and office building located at 186 Devonshire Street. He designed Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Rogers Building in 1864, located on Boylston Street near Boston's Copley Square, which housed the school's architecture department. Floor plans for the building show a large, centrally located space devoted to an architectural library and museum. Drawings from the Study Collection were hung on the studio walls and numerous casts and other artifacts also lined the walls and picture rails.Architecture at MIT, accessed August 12, 2010, includes photos Preston married Estelle M. Evans (1847‚Äì1920 ), whose father was the wealthy real estate developer Brice S. Evans, on December 6, 1866, and the couple had one son, Evans (1867‚Äì1900). William was an active member and fellow of the American Institute of Architects and served that organization in the office of first vice-president at the end of the 1890s. He was for many years a member of the Boston Society of Architects, and for thirty years served as its treasurer. He died at his home at 1063 Beacon Street in Brookline in 1910.

Inscription means: \\"Oberf√∂rster Koch Way / on the 50th anniversary of its opening / on 18.4.1914 / dedicated by the Wernigerode Harz Club\\" Plessenburg is a village in the borough of Ilsenburg in the Harz National Park, in the district of Harz in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt.  Location and establishment  In the years 1775-76 Count Henry Ernest of Stolberg- Wernigerode had a grand hunting lodge built on the K√∂nigskoll in the Huysburger H√§u south of Ilsenburg. He named it Plessenburg after his son-in- law, Prince Frederick Erdmann of Anhalt-K√∂then-Ple√ü. In the 19th century, there was a forester's house some distance away from the hunting lodge, which soon become a popular day tripper's cafe. In 1880 a timber-framed building was built for the kitchen staff immediately next to the hunting lodge. The kitchen staff building became a restaurant when the Princes of Stolberg-Wernigerode were dispossessed after the Second World War, and it was later joined structurally to the old hunting lodge. Today it is a popular inn for day visitors, the Gasthaus Plessenburg.  Tourism  Numerous footpaths converge on Plessenburg from the surrounding area; from Ilsenburg, Dr√ºbeck, Darlingerode, Wernigerode and Bad Harzburg. It is a popular intermediate stop on the outward or return journey to the highest peak in the Harz, the Brocken. Not far from the Plessenburg lie the crags of the Wolfsklippen with their observation platform, and the Ilse Falls in the Ilse valley. In addition there is a summer bus route from Wernigerode via Ilsenburg to Plessenburg (from the beginning of May to the end of October). Plessenburg and the Oberf√∂rster Koch Memorial are numbers 7 and 25 in the system of checkpoints on the Harzer Wandernadel hiking network. Also in the vicinity is the Ferdinandstein (no. 16).

They are usually made with baking powder or baking soda as a chemical leavening agent rather than yeast. They developed from hardtack which was first made from only flour and water, with later first lard and then baking powder being added. Biscuits, soda breads, and cornbread, among others, are often referred to collectively as \\"quick breads\\", to indicate that they do not need time to rise before baking. History=Earlier history American English and British English use the same word to refer to two distinctly different modern foods. Early hard biscuits (North American: cookies) were derived from a simple, storable version of bread. The word \\"biscuit\\" itself originates from the medieval Latin word 'biscoctus', meaning \\"twice-cooked\\". The modern Italian baked goods known as biscotti (also meaning \\"twice-cooked\\" in Italian) most closely resemble the Medieval Latin item and cooking technique. In the Hispanic world a bizcocho refers to an array of differing baked goods depending on the country, from Spain and throughout Hispanic America. In the Philippines, a biskotso (also spelled \\"biscocho\\"), derived from a word used by the Spanish conquerors, refers to a type of garlic bread. The definitive explanation for the differences in the usage of \\"biscuit\\" in the English speaking world is provided by Elizabeth David in English Bread and Yeast Cookery, in the chapter \\"Yeast Buns and Small Tea Cakes\\" and section \\"Soft Biscuits\\". She writes, > It is interesting that these soft biscuits are common to Scotland and > Guernsey, and that the term biscuit as applied to a soft product was > retained in these places, and in America, whereas in England it has > completely died out.Elizabeth David (1977) English Bread and Yeast Cookery, > Penguin Books Ltd., London Early European settlers in the United States brought with them a simple, easy style of cooking, most often based on ground wheat and warmed with gravy. Most were not wealthy men and women, and so it was a source of cheap nutrition. A very similar practice was also popular once with the Royal Navy as hard, flour based biscuits would keep for long journeys at sea but would also become so difficult to chew that they had to be softened up. These were first introduced in 1588 to the rations of ships and found their way into the New World by the 1700s at the latest. The biscuit emerged as a distinct food type in the early 19th century, before the American Civil War. Cooks created a cheaply produced addition for their meals that required no yeast, which was expensive and difficult to store. With no leavening agents except the bitter-tasting pearlash available, beaten biscuits were laboriously beaten and folded to incorporate air into the dough which expanded when heated in the oven causing the biscuit to rise. In eating, the advantage of the biscuit over a slice of bread was that it was harder, and hence kept its shape when wiping up gravy in the popular combination biscuits and gravy. In 1875, Alexander P. Ashbourne patented the first biscuit cutter. It consisted of a board to roll the biscuits out on, which was hinged to a metal plate with various biscuit cutter shapes mounted to it. Later history 1948 ad for Ballard Biscuits as described. Southern chefs may have had an advantage in creating biscuits. Northern American all-purpose flours, mainly grown in Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, are made from the hard spring wheats that grow in the North's cold- winter climate. Southern American bleached all-purpose flours, originally grown in the Carolinas, Georgia and Tennessee before national food distribution networks, are made from the soft winter wheat that grows in the warm Southern summer. This summer growth results in wheat that has less protein, which is more suited to the creation of quick breads, as well as cookies, cakes and muffins. Pre-shaped ready-to-bake biscuits can be purchased in supermarkets, in the form of small refrigerated cylindrical segments of dough encased in a cardboard can. These refrigerator biscuits were patented by Ballard and Ballard in 1931. Cooking and eating American biscuits are almost always a savoury food item. Sugar is rare and not part of the traditional recipe; such would have been difficult to get during the Civil War as evidenced by supply lines in the South getting disrupted by battle and the blowing up of railroads.https://www.thedailybeast.com/atlantas-fall-foretold- the-end-of-civil-war-bloodshed (Non-sweet and crunchy foodstuffs are always called \\"crackers.\\") They are not, and as illustrated above, never have been intended for consumption as a dessert or a sweet treat and are strictly savory in nature. A typical recipe will include baking powder or baking soda, flour, salt, shortening or butter, and milk or buttermilk. The percentages of these ingredients vary as historically the recipe would pass orally from family to family and generation to generation, but unlike scones, no recipe for Southern biscuits includes nuts, raisins, or dried fruit and they are never served with clotted cream. Biscuits can be prepared for baking in several ways. The dough can be rolled out flat and cut into rounds, which expand when baked into flaky-layered cylinders. If extra liquid is added, the dough's texture changes to resemble stiff pancake batter so that small spoonfuls can be dropped into the baking sheet to produce \\"drop biscuits\\", which are more amorphous in texture and shape. Large drop biscuits, because of their size and rough exterior texture, are sometimes referred to as \\"cat head biscuits\\". A common variation on basic biscuits is \\"cheese biscuits\\", made by adding grated Cheddar or American cheese to the basic recipe.Better Home's and Garden Cookbook At other times, biscuits are consumed for breakfast. They are meant to be served warm with a choice of spread of butter, honey, cane syrup, or some fruit based jam; otherwise they are cut in half and become the Southern version of the breakfast sandwich, in which any combination of Country ham, tomato, scrambled eggs, bacon, or sausage is put in the biscuits halves as a filling. For dinner, they are a popular accompaniment to fried chicken, nearly all types of Southern barbecue, and several Lowcountry dishes.https://www.charlestoncvb.com/blog/buttermilk-biscuits They also often figure in to the Southern version of Thanksgiving dinner as well. https://www.thespruceeats.com/southern-thanksgiving-dinner-recipes-4173849 Home cooks may use refrigerator biscuits for a quicker alternative to rolled or drop biscuits. Refrigerator biscuits can even be cooked over a campfire on a stick.Campfire Biscuits, OutdoorCook.com A sweet biscuit layered or topped with fruit (typically strawberries), juice-based syrup, and whipped cream is called shortcake. A type of biscuit called an \\"angel biscuit\\" contains yeast as well, as do those made with a sourdough starter.

To see it, one has to stand before the temple entrance and look in the opposite direction of the Padmatheertha pond. It is on the top of the Old Fort Palace. The unique feature of the clock is the presence of a bearded man on top of the dial who opens his mouth corresponding to every hour and two rams hit his cheek and forcing him to close his mouth. This action is co-oridnated with the hourly chimes. History It is said to have been installed in the 1840s during the reign of Maharaja Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma. The clock is constructed from Mahogany by an artisan called Kulathooran. Records show that two clockwork mechanisms were purchased by the then State of Travancore from Chennai. One was installed at Trivandrum, the other at Padmanabhapuram Palace, in Tamil Nadu. There is also a history that the clock was installed to commemorate the successful repulsion of Invasion of Travancore by Tippu Sultan. Present The clock still works perfectly, and strikes each hour in a day. The Methan Mani remains a popular landmark in the city with the chimes audible around the locality.

The first six volumes are \\"for organ or harmonium\\", so the pieces in them do not include a mandatory pedal part. Preface L'Anthologie des Ma√Ætres Contemporains de l'Orgue offers church musicians and all lovers of good music a careful selection of pieces that have not so far been published elsewhere. These pieces represent all styles and schools of composition, and have been drawn from all countries. They are in general not too demanding, and can be performed on a standard harmonium just as well as on the most elaborate instrument. The Anthology is thus a veritable encyclop√¶dia of modern writing for the organ, gaining an exceptional interest from offering a wide range of styles and from its international character. I am delighted to take this occasion of publicly acknowledging the gratitude I owe to the many and illustrious composers who, in response to my modest request for help, chose to write pieces specially for this Collection. It is this range of remarkable compositions that makes the Anthology worthy of a special place in the library of any organist. It is with particular pleasure that I can offer my gratitude and respect to mm. Ch.-M. Widor, F. de la Tombelle and Alphonse Mailly, who have graciously allowed me to dedicate a volume to each of them. Patronage at this level seems to me already a guarantee of success, and also the most authoritative possible confirmation of the value of the pieces included in the Anthology. While I was preparing this publication, m. Henry Eymieu was unstintingly generous with advice born of experience and with kindly encouragement; he also contributed to the biographical notes, giving them a personal and critical touch I much appreciate. I hope he may be pleased to accept my warmest thanks for his contribution! Though most of the composers represented in the Anthology are already well-known, it seemed to me useful to provide a few lines of biographical and bibliographical information for each of them. If these lines are unavoidably brief and incomplete, the pieces which these Modern Masters of the Organ have contributed will speak for their composers. Solemnity of liturgy and dignified church music! These matters are rightly, and all the more so since the publication of the motu proprio from His Holiness Pius X, of great concern to all who have received the noble task of praising the name of the Lord and of helping others do so. May this work I have undertaken for the sake of Religion and of Art add yet more to the splendour and beauty of our liturgical celebrations! Such is the desire of the Author: to see this desire realised would be the best possible reward for my modest labours! l'abb√© Jos.

Career Born in Brechin in 1915, Milne played for local club Brechin Vics, until signing for United in 1934. Remarkably, he scored four goals on his senior debut, which no other player in the club's history has done. Milne continued his prolific rate of scoring, netting 85 goals in 81 appearances for United. No other player in the club's history has achieved a ratio better than one goal per game. Milne had a pay dispute with United in 1937, which led to him going on trial with Liverpool. This trial, however, created a registration mix-up which led to Milne being declared a free agent. Hibernian took advantage of the opportunity to sign Milne for no fee. Milne also scored goals at a good rate for Hibs, finishing as their top scorer in the next two seasons. His career, however, was interrupted by the Second World War, which curtailed competitive football in the United Kingdom. The outbreak of war meant that players were allowed to play for other clubs with their team's permission. It was under these circumstances that in November 1939 Milne returned to play for Dundee United who had joined the Eastern Division of the recently set up emergency league. United were also competing in the hastily set up Scottish War Emergency Cup. Milne showed flashes of the form he had shown in his previous spell at Tannadice, as United reached the cup final; he scored a hat-trick in the second round of the competition in a 7-1 win over Third Lanark and was in the starting line-up in the final which his side narrowly lost to Rangers. Milne was United's top scorer for the season with 24 goals. Shortly afterwards he was called up for military service. During the war he appeared for Aberdeen in unofficial competitions.Arthur Milne, AFC Heritage Trust When league football resumed in 1946, Milne's career was nearing its end.Jeffrey, pp115-116. He only played in three league matches, scoring one goal, for Hibs after the war before being sold to St Mirren for ¬£1650. Milne played for the Paisley club for four seasons, before moving to Northern Ireland in the summer of 1950 to become a player/coach of Coleraine. Milne represented Scotland once, in a wartime international against England on 14 October 1944; Milne scored one of the Scottish goals in a 6‚Äì2 defeat.

Merrie Melodies animated short directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on October 20, 1945, and stars Sylvester the Cat. The cartoon marked the first appearance of Sylvester's long-time foe Hector the Bulldog, who would later become a recurring character in Tweety and Sylvester cartoons. The woodpecker would later reappear in A Peck o' Trouble, a Dodsworth Cat cartoon directed by Robert McKimson in 1953. Plot It's that time again. Sylvester is determined to get a male woodpecker that just moved in, high in a tree. He climbs, but the bird greases the tree; he starts to cut it down, but a mean dog (Hector, in his first appearance) stops him (this becomes a running gag). Several other attempts follow; at one point, he puts his paw into the bird's home, and the bird puts a tomato there; Sylvester squishes it, and the bird dresses as an angel to torment him, but Sylvester sees through the disguise. Finally, Sylvester tries to blow up the tree; the dog again intervenes. Sylvester gets the dynamite off the tree and puts out the fuses, but the bird has lit them again, and now Sylvester dies and really becomes an angel.

Early life and military career Armand Jean Galliot Joseph de Turenne was born in Le Mans, Sarthe, the son of Guillaume Auguste Alyre Georges de Turenne and Marie Th√©r√®se Madeleine Beaumevieille. On 15 April 1909 he volunteered to join the army for a period of three years, and served in the 10√®me r√©giment de Chasseurs √† cheval (\\"10th Light Cavalry Regiment\\"). He was promoted to brigadier (\\"corporal\\") on 10 February 1910 and to mar√©chal-des- logis (\\"sergeant\\") on 27 April 1911. His three years ended 13 April 1912, but he rejoined the army on 22 February 1913 and was posted to the 21√®me r√©giment de Dragons (\\"21st Dragoon Regiment\\") based at Saint-Omer. He was promoted to mar√©chal des logis fourrier (\\"quartermaster-sergeant\\") on 18 December 1913. World War I On 10 August 1914, within a week of the outbreak of World War I, de Turenne was appointed an aspirant (\\"officer candidate\\"). On 15 July 1915 he transferred to the Army's aviation service ‚Äì the A√©ronautique Militaire ‚Äì as an observer/bombardier, serving in Escadrille VB 102 of the 1er groupe de bombardement based at Malz√©ville from 21 July to 6 August 1915. He then trained as a pilot, receiving military pilot brevet No. 2135 at military flying school at Pau on 21 December 1915, and was commissioned as a sous- lieutenant on 26 December. After advanced training at military flying school at Avord from 4 January to 7 March 1916, he was assigned to the R√©serve G√©n√©rale de l'Aviation (RGA) from 7 March to 13 June, then finally to Escadrille N 48 on 13 June 1916 to fly Nieuport fighters. He scored his first victory on 17 November 1916, and was promoted to lieutenant on 31 December. He was made a Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur on 22 July 1917, his citation reading: :\\"A very courageous pilot who gives daily the highest example of boldness and initiative. On 6 July 1917 he downed, in the course of one flight, his third and fourth German planes, one of these in our lines. Cited in orders three times.\\" By 30 September 1917, he had half a dozen aerial victories to his credit. Five of them were shared, with fellow aces Jean Matton, Gilbert de Guingand, and Ren√© Montrion. De Turenne was appointed commander of Escadrille SPA 12 on 12 January 1918. In his nine victories with the SPADs of this squadron, he continued with teamwork in combat and branched out to become a balloon buster by downing two observation balloons. He not only shared victories with fellow aces Marcel Marc Dhome and Emile Regnier, but with several other pilots. An interesting sidelight on de Turenne's victory list is that he had only two solo victories, and there were no fewer than fifteen other pilots sharing one or more of the other thirteen triumphs. He was promoted to the temporary rank of captain on 17 July 1918, and this was made permanent on 25 December. His achievements were not just personal ones; his squadron was cited in General Orders for their accomplishments under his command.Over the Front: The Complete Record of the Fighter Aces and Units of the United States and French Air Services, 1914‚Äì1918, pp. 148 - 149 Inter- war career After the war de Turenne stayed in the army.

The VVV was a major stepping stone in the creation of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, which would end up becoming the most decorated regiment in United States armed forces history. History On the day of the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States announced that all Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) students were to report for military duty, forming the Hawaii Territorial Guard (HTG). These ROTC students were given a rifle with only five bullets and ordered to guard vital installations such as bridges, wells, reservoirs, pumping stations, water tanks, and high schools.Odo, Franklin. No Sword to Bury: Japanese Americans in Hawai'i during World War II. Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2004. Pg. 122. About a month later it came to the attention of officials in Washington DC that there were Japanese Americans within the HTG. They were ordered back to headquarters where those of Japanese ancestry were dismissed from duty because 4C-\\"enemy aliens\\" were ineligible to serve in the military. After their dismissal, the students that were with the HTG returned to campus to talk amongst themselves. They met Hung Wai Ching who suggested the students volunteer in a labor battalion.Go For Broke National Education Center video archive. Film #074, Tape 2, Ted Tsukiyama Soon after a petition was written and signed by the ROTC students then sent to the military governor at the time, Delos C. Emmons, which reads, We, the undersigned, were members of the Hawaii Territorial Guard until its recent inactivation. We joined the Guard voluntarily with the hope that this was one way to serve our country in her time of need. Needless to say, we were deeply disappointed when we were told that our services in the Guard were no longer needed. Hawaii is our home; the United States, our country. We know but one loyalty and that is to the Stars and Stripes. We wish to do our part as loyal Americans in every way possible and we hereby offer ourselves for whatever service you may see fit to use us.Odo, Franklin. No Sword to Bury: Japanese Americans in Hawai'i during World War II. Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2004. Pg. 147. In February 1942, the 169 students got their wish and became a labor battalion to be known as the Varsity Victory Volunteers. Organization The VVV was assigned to Schofield Barracks and were under the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, attached to the 34th Combat Engineers Regiment. The VVV was broken down into 12 gangs and each one given a specific task. They did various labor tasks such as: build roads, military installations, fences, string barbed wire, and work in the quarry. They were placed into 3 separate barracks, Varsity, Victory and Volunteers, given a cot, a mattress, food and little to no pay. As time progressed the VVV began to warm up to and gain trust with other units at Schofield that were not of Japanese ancestry. Picnics and parties were held among all races at Schofield including friendly competition. The VVV adopted a football team, boxing team, basketball team, and golf team as well.Odo, Franklin. No Sword to Bury: Japanese Americans in Hawai'i during World War II. Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2004. Pgs. 167-180. Afterwards In December 1942, the VVV would get a visit from Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy who would so happened to be escorted by Hung Wai Ching. Ching made certain McCloy noticed the VVV. In January 1943, the War Department would make an announcement that an all Nisei Regiment was being formed and there was a call for volunteers.by Ted Tsukiyama The VVV asked to be disbanded to join the newly formed 442nd Regimental Combat Team.

Film #552, Tape 2, Hideo Kuniyoshi Legacy The VVV not only led to the 442nd Regimental Combat Team but it also improved racial stability in the Hawaiian community since many Japanese communities in Hawaii were upset at the way they had been treated. Men such as John Young, Bob Shivers, Kendall J. Fielder, Charles Hemenway, Charles Loomis, Miles Cary, Stephen Mark, Leslie Hicks, and Riley Allen all saw that to not create a racial uproar was of extreme importance.Odo, Franklin. No Sword to Bury: Japanese Americans in Hawai'i during World War II. Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2004. Pg. 152. It was the VVV which marked the turning point in the treatment of the people of Japanese ancestry in this Territory and their acceptance by the rest of the community. What followed afterward-the record of the 100th, the formation of the 442nd and its history of hard-won battles, the less publicized but equally important and impressive record of the interpreter groups, and the work of the civilians on the home front-was the natural result of the trend which was started in the early months of the war when a group of young men, who numbered at no time more than 170, demonstrated to a suspicious and skeptical community that the Americans of Japanese ancestry were every bit as American and every bit as loyal to this country and to her ideals as any other group of Americans, whether they were white, yellow, black, or brown.Allen, Gwenfread.

Drilling risers are categorised into two types: marine drilling risers used with subsea blowout preventer (BOP) and generally used by floating drilling vessels; and tie-back drilling risers used with a surface BOP and generally deployed from fixed platforms or very stable floating platforms like a spar or tension leg platform (TLP).Oilfield glossary ‚Äì Drilling riser Marine drilling riser A marine drilling riser has a large diameter, low pressure main tube with external auxiliary lines that include high pressure choke and kill lines for circulating fluids to the subsea blowout preventer (BOP), and usually power and control lines for the BOP. The design and operation of marine drilling risers is complex, and the requirement for high reliability means an extensive amount of engineering analysis is required.Fundamentals of Marine Riser Mechanics: Basic Principles and Simplified Analysis, Charles P. Sparks, When used in water depths greater than about 20 meters, the marine drilling riser has to be tensioned to maintain stability. A marine riser tensioner located on the drilling platform provides a near constant tension force adequate to maintain the stability of the riser in the offshore environment. The level of tension required is related to the weight of the riser equipment, the buoyancy of the riser, the forces from waves and currents, the weight of the internal fluids, and an adequate allowance for equipment failures. To reduce the amount of tension required to maintain stability of the riser, buoyancy modules, known in the industry as 'buoyancy cakes', are added to the riser joints to make them close to neutrally buoyant when submerged. The international standard ISO 13624-1:2009 covers the design, selection, operation and maintenance of marine riser systems for floating drilling operations.ISO 13624-1 Design and operation of marine drilling riser equipment ‚Äì 22426 Its purpose is to serve as a reference for designers, for those who select system components, and for those who use and maintain this equipment. It relies on basic engineering principles and the accumulated experience of offshore operators, contractors, and manufacturers.

The second company was composed solely of white citizens. First company In 1857, the First Hawaiian Cavalry, an artillery and infantry company which was originally established in 1852, was renamed the Honolulu Rifles and changed to solely an infantry unit. The unit was first commanded by Captain R. Coady, and later by Captain Charles T. Gulick. It was disbanded in 1874 after failing to respond during the Honolulu Courthouse riot, although their founding constitution stipulated that only the government could call on them and no command was ever received at the time of the insurrection. Second company The second company was organized in the spring of 1884 with the approval of the cabinet and King Kalakaua who gave the group its name. The organization's first use was on April 26, 1885 at the death of the Dowager Queen Emma, to stand guard at her residence after her passing. The organization held little prominence until after 1886 when the company came into the leadership of Volney V. Ashford, who had extensive military experience with the United States during the Civil war and later with the Canadian Militia. The company began its rise when it won a drill competition at Kalakaua's 50th birthday celebration. The Rifles were a part of the social community of Hawaii and in 1887 hosted an exhibition and dance for the community, attended by most of the political figures of the day, where the king presented them with the flag of the Kingdom. The ranks of the organization grew significantly after January 1887 when the it adopted a resolution to become subject to an act of 1886 \\"To organize the military forces of the kingdom\\". By March of that year it split into two companies, A and B, forming a battalion. The following month, Portuguese residents formed another company that became company C by May 25. The act of 1886 required a Commander-in-Chief of the rank of lieutenant general to oversee the military forces of the Kingdom. John O. Dominis was given this position while the King himself, under this act, was the Supreme Commander, referred to as Generalissimo. Eventually the act of 1886 would be deemed unconstitutional. The Honolulu Rifles were disbanded on August 23, 1890. At what point the Rifles became part of the Hawaiian League known as the Committee of Safety is still somewhat unclear. More than likely the expansion of the company coincided with the formation of the Hawaiian league.

It is the capital of the West Manggarai Regency (Kabupaten Manggarai Barat), one of the eight regencies which are the major administrative divisions of Flores. Tourism Once a small fishing village, Labuan Bajo (also spelled Labuhanbajo and Labuanbajo) is now a tourist center as well as a centre of government for the surrounding region.Benito Lopulalan, 'Growing Tourism on Flores' , The Jakarta Globe, 24 February 2009. Facilities to support tourist activities are expanding quickly although the rapid rise in the numbers of visitors is imposing some strains on the local environment.Markus Markur, 'Labuan Bajo faces challenges with rising tourism', The Jakarta Post, 7 September 2017. Komodo National Park Labuan Bajo is the gateway for trips across the nearby Komodo National Park to Komodo Island and Rinca Island, both home to the famous Komodo dragons. There are numerous snorkling points in the islands close to Labuan Bajo. Kanawa and Seraya Islands, for example, offer good diving and snorkeling sites. Currents can be strong at some sites however so care is needed.Diving near Komodo and Rinca Islands. Every evening at Kalong Island, to the south of Labuan Bajo, thousands of flying fox bats (known as burung kalong in Indonesian) provide an amazing display. Around dusk the bats rise up from the mangroves around Kalong Island and within a few minutes, a column begins to form as thousands of bats begin to traverse across to the main island of Flores to the east. More and more bats join the column for perhaps the next 30 mins or so. The column soon forms into a remarkable trail across the sky stretching for miles as the bats fly east to Flores to search for food in the nearby forests. Other features Other features nearby to Labuan Bajo include several waterfalls, trekking facilities, and many diverse beaches. The town is quite small and can easily be traversed on foot in 15 minutes or so. Mirror stone cave (Batu cermin cave) is only 4 km away. There are various interesting churches and a mosque. Ojeks (Rp 3,000-5,000) and bemos pass every five minutes. One can rent a motorcycle for Rp 75,000 (about $US 5) per day. There are now (January 2019) numerous ATMs around the town and the main roads are paved. Heading east from Labuan Bajo, one can travel by road (bus or car) to other towns across Flores such as Ruteng, Bajawa, Ende and Maumere. \\"Gereja Masehi Injili\\" Dutch reformed church Transport Komodo Airport is located just 2 km from the center of Labuan Bajo and has 4-6 daily flights arriving from Bali and elsewhere. Labuan Bajo port has daily ferry departures to the town of Bima to the west on the large island of Sumbawa and weekly or bi-weekly departures to Denpasar and Sulawesi. There are also direct flights from Jakarta to Labuan Bajo by Garuda Indonesia and Batik Air.  Economy  The local economy in the town is centred around the ferry port and tourism, local shops and restaurants, and the diving trade. Most of the foreign tourists are European, many from Italy, and also from Australia and the United Kingdom. The wider area produces fish and palm oil; there is also a large amount of subsistence agriculture in the villages in the region where living standards are still low. Levels of poverty in the rural areas are high.

The family was descended from Spanish Jews from Castile who immigrated to the Holy Land after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492. His father was born in Hebron. He opened religious schools for Sephardi boys in the Nahalat Shiv'a and Bukharim quarters of Jerusalem. Moshe grew up in the Bukharim neighborhood, where he attended his father's school. At the age of 13, he was accepted to the Bezalel Art School, directed by Boris Schatz, where he studied from 1921 to 1925. His teacher, Shmuel Ben David, encouraged him to study art in Paris. Castel traveled to Paris in 1927, where he attended Acad√©mie Julian and Ecole du Louvre. He sat in the Louvre copying the works of Rembrandt, Velasquez, Delacroix and Courbet, intrigued by their paint-layering techniques.About the artist It was here that he began to realize that \\"art is not symbolic, but rather material, the material is the main thing, the way the paint is placed, the way the layers are placed on the picture, this is the most essential thing.\\" In May 1927, the World Union of Hebrew Youth in Paris sponsored his first exhibit. Ze'ev Jabotinsky, who was in Paris at the time, wrote an introduction for the catalogue. In 1940, Castel returned to Palestine and settled in Safed. In 1949, Castel married Bilhah (n√©e Bauman), an actress.

Inspired by the basalt blocks he saw there, engraved with images and ornaments, he began to use ground basalt, which he molded into shapes, as his basic material.Moshe Castel, 82, Dies; Innovator in Israeli Art The technique utilized ground basalt rock mixed with sand and glue, infused with the rich colors that became his trademark. The works were embellished with archaic forms derived from ancient script, symbolism and mythological signs from Hebrew and Sumerian culture.

Designed for recording, arrangement and mixing, it emulates a recording studio, with a mixing desk, a rack of virtual instruments and effects and an audio and MIDI sequencer. Record can be used either as a complete virtual recording studio in itself, or together with Propellerhead Software's Reason. General Record was released on September 9, 2009, after a two-month trial period, open to users who signed up at www.recordyou.com. The program's design mimics an SSL 9000k mixing desk and a rack into which users can insert virtual devices such as instruments and effects processors. These modules can be controlled from Record's built-in MIDI and audio sequencer or from other sequencing applications via Propellerhead's ReWire protocol. Hotkeys are used for switching between these three main areas. Recording of external audio sources is handled in Record's built-in sequencer, which includes tools for comping together multiple takes into a single recording, and automatic timestretch when the tempo is changed. Like Propellerhead's Reason, Record's interface includes a Toggle Rack command, which flips the rack around to display the devices from the rear. Here the user can route virtual audio and CV cables from one piece of equipment to another. This cable layout enables the creation of complex effects chains and allows devices to modulate one another. In reviews, Record has been praised for its stability, the quality of the time stretch algorithm and built-in mixer, as well as the seamless integration with Reason, while it has been criticized for its lack of support for third party plug-ins. In 2011, Record was merged into Reason 6, and the standalone version was discontinued. Instruments and effects Record contains a limited set of instruments and effects that can be expanded with Propellerhead's Reason. Included with Record are: *Combinator: combines multiple modules into on, to create new instruments and effect chains *ID-8: a sample playback device featuring drums, pianos, bass, strings, etc. *MClass Equalizer: a four-band EQ *MClass Stereo Imager: a two band stereo imaging processor *MClass Compressor: single band compressor *MClass Maximizer: limiter device *Line 6 Guitar Amp: a virtual version of Line 6's guitar POD, emulating three guitar amplifiers and speaker cabinets *Line 6 Bass Amp: a virtual version of Line 6's bass POD, emulating two bass amplifiers and speaker cabinets *Neptune Pitch Correction & Voice Synth: a hybrid effect and instrument device for correcting pitch and adding synthesized harmonies *RV7000 Advanced Reverb: a reverb with nine reverb algorithms, including Small Space, Room, Hall, Arena, Plate, Spring, Echo, Multitap and Reverse *Scream 4 Distortion: a distortion module with ten different distortion models: Overdrive, Distortion, Fuzz, Tube, Tape, Feedback, Modulate, Warp, Digital and Scream *DDL-1 Digital Delay Line: a simple delay effect *CF-101 Chorus/Flanger: a chorus and flanger effect Additional Interface Pressing the tab key on the computer keyboard reveals the Record racks back side, where you can access additional parameters for the rackmounted devices, including signal cables for audio and CV. This allows users to virtually route cables connecting the devices in the rack like in a traditional hardware based studio. For example, a device's output can be split into two signal chains for different processing, and the connected to different mixer channels. Users can choose where to draw the line between simplicity and precision, allowing Record to remain useful at various levels of knowledge and ambition on the user's part. Record 1.5 A new version was released on 25 August 2010. New features include Blocks, a non-linear sequencer mode for arranging and writing music, and the Neptune device, a pitch-editing tool and voice synth designed for vocals. Other features include: use of multiple USB keyboards, tap-tempo, and reverse audio, as well as integration with Reason 5.

Typically, up to 20% of subsidiary shares is offered to the public. Entities The transaction creates two separate legal entities, the parent and the daughter company, each with its own board, management team, CEO, and financials. Equity carve-outs increase the access to capital markets, giving the carved-out subsidiary strong growth opportunities, while avoiding the negative signaling associated with a seasoned offering (SEO) of the parent equity. Advantages If the parent company wants to fully divest the subsidiary, then an equity carve-out allows a prior evaluation of the subsidiary's market value and creates a credible transaction history. Challenges Challenging accounting issues can arise when acquiring carve- outs.

Steinbier is not mashed in kettles, but in wooden tubs. Its name is derived from the hot stones that were put into the mashing tubs to achieve the required temperature for production. Due to the contact of the glowing, hot stones--often heated directly in the fire--with the malt, the resulting beer has a taste of caramel and soot. This was a traditional brewing process; top-fermenting yeasts and a taste of fruity ester were usual and there was no emphasis on long term storability. Steinbier was usually not filtered.

He played for nearly a dozen clubs during his extensive career, in both Portugal and France. He amassed Primeira Liga totals of 192 games and 30 goals, over the course of a decade. Club career Born in Luanda, Portuguese Angola, Pl√°cido made his professional and Primeira Liga debuts at just 17, with lowly Amora FC. After showing promise at his following two clubs, Vit√≥ria F.C. and G.D. Chaves (with seven goals scored, he helped the latter qualify for the only time in its history for the UEFA Cup) the 23-year-old signed for FC Porto, but failed to adjust grossly. In the following summer, Pl√°cido moved to fellow league team Sporting Clube de Portugal, meeting the same fate. In January 1989 he moved abroad to France, signing with Racing Club de France football Colombes 92 where he also failed to establish, often being demoted to the reserves of the Ligue 1 side and suffering relegation in his only full season. A second spell at Porto, in the 1990‚Äì91 campaign, also proved unassuming, as he only appeared in four matches, all from the bench. After one more year in Portugal, at S.C. Salgueiros, Pl√°cido returned to France, continuing to play until the age of 37 in the country's lower leagues in representation of US Cr√©teil-Lusitanos, US Lusitanos and Saint-Denis FC. He never appeared in higher than the latter nation's third level. International career Pl√°cido played three times for Portugal, scoring twice. His arrival coincided with the defection of practically all of the members of the national team, after the infamous Saltillo Affair at the 1986 FIFA World Cup. On 29 March 1987, Pl√°cido's most important moment in the international scene arrived as his brace helped avoid a shock defeat in Madeira against Malta for the UEFA Euro 1988 qualifiers (2‚Äì2).

He created battle schools, where Frisians boys of 15 years and older were educated in weaponry, and he sent his bastard brother Titus Bojocalis with auxiliary troops in the army of Emperor Marcus Aurelius against the Vandals. A group of 1500 Vandals went west to the borders of Denmark, which was at the time larger than it is now, but were driven away, after which they went south over Elbe and Weser towards Frisia. They had already reached the Eem when the Frisians appeared with all their power to prevent the enemy crossing the river. When both armies faced each other across the river, Titus Bojocalis together with eighthundred men crossed the Eem higher up the river and unexpectedly attacked the enemy, killing many of them and driving the remainder into the river. About four hundred of them crossed it swimming, but Adelbold killed most of them. Adelbold, who contracted a debilitating disease after this victory, proposed the Frisians to appoint Titus as commander-in-chief in his stead. And so it came to be that Titus was elected Duke of the Frisians in 187. Shortly after he was thus promoted, Adelbold again regained his good health. Titus wanted to hand him the government back, but Adelbold, who together with his disease seemed to have lost his warriorlike character, rejected the offer and continued the rest of his life in quiet.

Thus, the MZES is the largest institute of the University of Mannheim, and the largest research institute of a German university in the field of the social sciences. From 1989‚Äì1998 the institute was composed of four work units: * I Social structure and the Welfare State * II Elections and Policy Research * III Political and Social Integration * IV German Democratic Republic / East Europe (1992 to 1998) In 1999, these four work units were reduced to two research departments: * Research Department A, The European Societies and their Integration: since February 2017 directed by the sociologist Henning Hillmann. * Research Department B, The European Political Systems and their Integration : since February 2017 directed by the political scientist Harald Schoen. The director and the heads of the research departments together form the executive board of the institute. The activity of the executive board and the institute is controlled by a supervisory board. The institute's research program is outlined for three years and evaluated by an international scientific advisory board. An annual report informs about the institute's activity.  Directors  The director is elected by the supervisory board for a period of three years. * Peter Flora 1989‚Äì1992 founding director, sociology * Franz Urban Pappi 1993‚Äì1995, political science * Peter Flora 1996‚Äì1998, sociology * Jan W. van Deth 1999‚Äì2001, political science * Walter M√ºller 2002‚Äì2004, sociology * Wolfgang C.

They also included multi-instrumentalist Pete Wingfield, and had a number of hit singles in both the US and UK. History In 1973, Mike Vernon, a British record producer and founder of Blue Horizon, put together a group of session musicians to play on an album with blues musician Jimmy Dawkins, to be recorded at Olympic Studios in London. The musicians included keyboard player and vocalist Pete Wingfield, singer George Chandler, guitarist Joe Jammer, bassist DeLisle Harper, and drummer Glen LeFleur, of whom Chandler, Harper and LeFleur were also members of jazz-funk band Gonzalez. When Dawkins' arrival was delayed, the musicians recorded a funk track in the spare studio time. Vernon then sold the track, \\"Put The Music Where Your Mouth Is\\", credited to The Olympic Runners, to London Records in New York City, and in 1974 it became a hit on the US R&B; Chart, reaching no. 72. Following its success, the musicians recorded an album, including the track \\"Grab It\\" which also made the R&B; charts. They recorded a second album, Out in Front, in 1975, shortly before Wingfield had his own solo hit single, \\"Eighteen with a Bullet\\". A third album, Don't Let Up, soon followed, together with a succession of singles. The 1976 album Hot To Trot has been cited as their finest. Wingfield described the recording process: > \\"Barry Hammond the engineer would always keep a 2-track quarter-inch tape > running so as to catch us jamming between takes ‚Äì then we'd use that jamming > as the basis for the next track. It was painless, we made album after album > that way, it only took a couple of weeks out of the year, and we were > selling records! For the first few years the band were completely anonymous > ‚Äì people assumed we were a US act...\\" Their commercial success diminished in the US at the same time as it grew in the UK, and their biggest successes in the UK charts came in 1978‚Äì79, with the hit singles \\"Get It While You Can\\" and \\"Sir Dancealot\\". In 1979 they also performed the theme tune for the film The Bitch, starring Joan Collins, which gave them a third UK Top 40 hit. The group split up in 1979. Vernon and Wingfield later joined Rocky Sharpe & the Replays, and the other band members continued as session musicians. Several Olympic Runners tracks have been sampled by later artists, including Everlast.

The Royal Order The order was established with a decree of the Knyaz on 19 May 1900 as a sign of the benevolence of the Monarch to the bravery of the Bulgarian army. It was similar to the Order of Civil Merit but made for military personnel. The order was given to military figures for immaculate service and special merit. It was established with six grades and in 1933 the Grand Cross was added. The order had a shape of Pisan cross with shoulder covered in red enamel. There were two swords between them with edges pointing to the top. In the centre of the averse was placed the monogram of the founder Knyaz Ferdinand, surrounded by a ring in green enamel with inscription –ó–ê –í–û–ï–ù–ù–ê –ó–ê–°–õ–£–ì–ê (For Military Merit). The averse resembled that of the Order of Civil Merit but with green ring. It had a royal crown on the top. During war the order had slightly different resemblance with laurel wreath on the shoulders of the cross and white ring. The Grand Cross was worn on a wide yellow ribbon with black and white edges - the colours of the Saxe- Coburg and Gotha dynasty. The fourth, fifth and sixth grade were worn on a small triangle ribbon on the chest. After 9 September 1944 the ribbon was substituted with the one of the Order of Civil Merit, the monogram of Ferdinand was removed and replaced with the Bulgaria tricolour flag. In the 1950s the order was abolished. It was restored in two grades in 2004. Grades * I grade, Grand Cross. Awarded to senior state officers and military personnel.

The cabinet was formed as a direct consequence of the assassination of the incumbent prime minister Olof Palme on 28 February 1986. After which the Speaker of the Parliament, Ingemund Bengtsson, in accordance with the Constitution of Sweden discharged all ministers.The Swedish Instrument of Government, which is one out of four parts of the Constitution of Sweden, states in Chapter 6, Art. 7, that ‚ÄúIf the Prime Minister is discharged or dies, the Speaker shall discharge the other ministers.‚Äù In the course of the first cabinet of Ingvar Carlsson, Sweden ‚Äî as well as most other western countries in the late 80s ‚Äî enjoyed a period of economic expansion. The cabinet undertook a reform of the Swedish tax system, which meant that more income tax went directly to the municipalities, instead of the state. The reform also meant that a flat capital gains tax was implemented. During these years Sweden saw two widely publicised political scandals; the Ebbe Carlsson affair and the Bofors scandal. Politics After the assassination of prime minister Olof Palme on 28 February 1986, the second cabinet of Palme continued to serve as an interim cabinet (sv. expeditionsregering) led by Deputy Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson until 12 March 1986. The cabinet of Carlsson acceded formally that day, after Carlsson had been elected prime minister by the parliament with 178 votes for and 0 against. 159 members refrained from voting, and 12 were not present. Apart from the new prime minister, the first cabinet of Carlsson was almost identical with the second cabinet of Palme. However the Minister for Energy Affairs, also acceded Carlsson's former office as Minister of the Environment Foreign Affairs Between 14 and 17 April 1986 the Prime Minister made a visit to Moscow. The purpose of the visit was to discuss the ongoing border dispute between Sweden and Soviet in the Baltic Sea. The exact stretch of the border had been a matter of disagreement since the late 1960s. Both parties wanted to draw the border through the middle of the Baltic Sea, however they did not agree on what constituted the middle. They disputed area consisted of 13 500 km¬≤. Sweden wanted to draw the border in a middle, calculated between Gotland and the Baltic states, while Soviet wanted to the count from the Swedish mainland. The Soviet proposal would have meant a borderline stretching just east of Gotland. In January 1988, the Premier of the Soviet Union, Nikolai Ryzhkov made an official visit to Stockholm. Among the issues discussed was the border dispute. It was decided that Sweden were to be given seventy-five percents of the disputed area, while the Soviet Union received the remaining twenty-five percents. Furthermore, the two parties agree on a transition of fishing regulations for the coming twenty years. In the middle of 1986 a debate concerning whether or not Sweden should implement a complete trade embargo towards apartheid South Africa emerged. Denmark and Norway had already announced that they intended to implement an embargo. The Centre Party, the Liberal People's Party, the Social Democratic Youth League, the league of Social Democratic Women in Sweden and the Swedish Association of Christian Social Democrats had all announced their support of an embargo. Import of agricultural products had already been prohibited on 1 January 1986. The Prime Minister, however, wanted to wait on the decision of the United Nations Security Council. On 12 March 1987 the decision to implement a complete trade embargo towards South Africa and Namibia, starting on 1 July the same year, was taken. In May 1988, Carlsson traveled to the capitols of several of the member states of the European Economic Community (EEC). The Prime Minister visited Madrid, Brussels, Bonn and London. The purpose of the visits was to explain Sweden's attitude towards the EEC. Carlsson line was that Sweden was to collaborate with the EEC in all areas except, foreign policy, where Sweden's policy of neutrality hindered it from participate. Therefore, Sweden could not become a member of the EEC. Early in 1988 the Minister of Foreign Affairs Sten Andersson visited Syria, Jordan and Israel. On 6 December 1988 the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization Yasser Arafat visited Sweden on an official state visit to Stockholm. During his visit, Arafat acknowledge Israel's right to exist and condemned terror as a weapon. In November the following year Sten Andersson visited the Baltic states, where he declared that the Baltic states were not occupied by the Soviet Union. For this statement Andersson received severe criticism in Sweden. In his memoirs the minister defends his statement, writing that the Baltic states were annexed which, according to Public international law, is not the same thing as occupation. The Ebbe Carlsson affair and the Bofors scandal Several widely publicised political scandals took place during 1987. In March the Indian newspapers the Indian Express and The Hindu accused the then Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and several others of receiving kickbacks from the Swedish weapons producer Bofors for winning a bid to supply India's 155 mm field howitzer. The scale of the corruption was far worse than any that India had seen before, and directly led to the defeat of Gandhi's ruling Indian National Congress party in the November 1989 general elections.http://www.rediff.com/news/1999/sep/23vir.htm The affair became known as the Bofors scandal. During the night between 5 and 6 October Stig Bergling, a former officer in the Swedish Security Service who had been convicted of espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union, managed to escape while on furlough. After receiving heavy criticism, the Minister of Justice Sten Wickbom resigned on 19 October. During the year the much troubled police investigation of the assassination of Olof Palme lingered on. Due to failure to present results the Stockholm county administrative chief of police Hans Holm√©r was forced to resign. On 1 June 1988 the Ebbe Carlsson affair started, when the newspaper Expressen revealed that the publisher Ebbe Carlsson had been given access to top secret documents concerning the Palme investigation. The new Minister of Justice Anna-Greta Leijon, who had authorised Ebbe Carlsson's involvement in the investigation, resigned on 7 June. Energy and Environment policy Shortly before Christmas 1985, the Minister of the Environment and Energy Affairs Birgitta Dahl, pledged to present a plan to phase out nuclear power in Sweden by 1995. After the 1986 Chernobyl accident in Ukraine, an expert committee was formed by the government. The committee was to investigate the security of nuclear energy. To form a broad consensus regarding the future of nuclear energy in Sweden, the cabinet invited the other political parties for discussion. On 12 February 1987 the discussions failed. The following day Dahl announced that the government intended to start the phase out between 1990 and 1997. In the beginning of 1987 they presented a Motion (parliamentary procedure) to close the first nuclear reactor sometime in the period 1993‚Äì1995 and the second during 1994‚Äì1996. In 1988 the Moderate Party proposed a national Carbon dioxide limit. Which meant that nuclear power plants could not be replaced by fossil fuel power plants. The same year the cabinet revised their nuclear proposition; now the first reactor was to be closed by 1995, and the second by 1996. The plants where reactors were to be closed were Barseb√§ck and Ringhals. Dahl declared that the decision was \\"irreversible.\\" But after debates in parliament the Liberal People's Party and the Centre Party, together with members of the social democratic party, reverted the decision in 1991. Social policy During February 1986 the cabinet held negotiations about with the conservative opposition about social policy. The Social Democratic Party wanted to raise child allowances and extend parental allowance. By 28 February the Moderate Party, the Centre Party, and the Liberal People's Party had left the negotiations. The Centre Party later returned to negotiations, and with support from them and the Left Party the proposition passed. The new lawLag (1986:378) om f√∂rl√§ngt barnbidrag. [Law (1986:378) regarding extended child benefit]. meant that child allowance was raised from 400 SEK/month to 485 SEK/month. General election, 1988 Before the general election in 1988, the three conservative parties agree on a proposal to implement a taxed health care allowance on 15 000 SEK per child and year. Cost of childcare up to the same amount would be deductible in the declaration. In total the proposal would have costed 8 billion Swedish crowns. The social democrats instead wanted to extend parental allowance during a period of three years, from nine to eight months. The Social Democrat's proposal were to cost 5,5 billions. The Social Democratic Party lost three seats in the election. The communistic Left Party gained one seat. The Green Party passed the election threshold for the first time, receiving 5.5 percent of the votes and thus twenty seats in parliament. The conservative parties together lost nineteen seats.

Worley noise is a noise function introduced by Steven Worley in 1996. In computer graphics it is used to create procedural textures, i.e. textures that are created automatically with arbitrary precision and do not have to be drawn by hand. Worley noise comes close to simulating textures of stone, water, or biological cells. Basic algorithm The basic idea is to take random points in space (2- or 3-dimensional) and then for every location in space take the distances dn to the nth-closest point (e.g. the second-closest point) and use combinations of those to control color information ( note that dn+1 > dn). More precisely: * Randomly distribute feature points in space organised as grid cells. In practice this is done on the fly without storage (as a procedural noise). The original method considered a variable number of seed points per cell so as to mimic a Poisson distribution, but many implementations just put one. * At run time, extract the distances dn from the given location to the nth-closest seed point. This can be done efficiently by visiting the current cell plus its neighbors. * Noise W(x) is formally the vector of distances, plus possibly the corresponding seed ids, user-combined so as to produce a color.

The centrists was a group that emerged from the nascent Communist Party of Yugoslavia. The centrists had proposed that the Communist Party should tone down its revolutionary line, seek cooperation with the government and distance itself from the Communist International, in order to save the party from the harsh repression inflicted upon it. After having made these proposals public in a 'Manifesto of the Opposition' (issued in November 1920, signed by 115 persons), they were all promptly expelled from the Communist Party. Initially the centrists tried to stay clear from both the social democrats and the communists, and in March 1921 they formed the Socialist Workers Party of Yugoslavia. But this endeavour soon proved fruitless, and the centrists found themselves obliged to merge with Koraƒá's Social Democratic Party of Yugoslavia, formed in April 1920. However, some centrists would remain opposed to this merger.  Further development  As of the late 1920s, the party claimed a membership of around 4,000, out of whom 300 were women. The youth organization of the party had around 1,500 members. The party got around 25,000 votes in the 1927 municipal election, and won around 100 seats in local councils around the country.

Abernethy believed that most diseases were due to disorders in digestion. The Abernethy biscuit is a type of digestive biscuit, a baked good originally designed to be eaten as a support to proper digestion. In creating his biscuit, Abernethy was following a trend of other medical practitioners like English William Oliver of Bath, Somerset (invented the Bath Oliver) and the American preacher Sylvester Graham who was a nutrition expert (the Graham cracker). The Abernethy biscuit is an adaptation of the plain captain's biscuit or hardtack, with the added ingredients of sugar (for energy), and caraway seeds because of their reputation for having a carminative (prevents flatulence) effect making them beneficial in digestive disorders. The biscuit is a mix between an all butter biscuit and a shortcake, raising through use of ammonium bicarbonate. According to The Oxford Companion to Food, a baker at a shop where Abernethy regularly had lunch created the new biscuit when Abernethy suggested it, naming it after him. Abernethy biscuits are still popular in Scotland. They are manufactured commercially by Simmers (Edinburgh), Browns Bakery (Orkney Islands), Walls Bakeries (Shetland Islands), and by Stag Bakeries (Isle of Lewis). Sample ingredient list The following are ingredients: *Abernethy Biscuits.Middlemass, Scottish Abernethy plaque.Plain flour *Caster sugar (granulated sugar can also be used) *Butter *Baking powder *Caraway seeds *Milk *Egg *Salt The biscuit in history When British statesman William Gladstone was Vice-President of the Board of Trade in the 1840s, his only luncheon consisted of an Abernethy biscuit, brought to him by his wife. In the libretto of the comic opera Princess Toto written by W. S. Gilbert (first performance 24 June 1876) the king disguises himself as an Abernethy Biscuit. In Charles Dickens' first novel The Pickwick Papers, the character of Mr. Solomon Pell is found, \\"in court, regaling himself,...., with a cold collation of an Abernethy biscuit and a saveloy\\".\\"The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club\\", (1836) p. 774, Charles Dickens  See also  * Bath Oliver * Graham cracker * Digestive biscuit References Category:Goods manufactured in Scotland Category:Scottish desserts Category:Biscuits (British style) Category:Victorian cuisine Category:Types of food Category:English cuisine ","title":"Abernethy biscuit"},{"id":"25815666","title":"Presidency of Fidel Ramos"},{"id":"25815668","text":"The following is a list of years related to the indexing of British radio.

This method saves the user much time and bandwidth. In general, this method of external backup is highly effective when the backup solution supports incremental or differential backups.

She was built in the Odero-Terni-Orlando shipyard in Livorno in the early 1930s and entered service in 1932. She was the third of four ships in the class, which also included , , and . Pola was built as a flagship with a larger conning tower to accommodate an admiral's staff. Like her sisters, she was armed with a battery of eight guns and was capable of a top speed of . Pola initially served as the flagship of the 2nd Squadron, and in 1940 she led the squadron during the battles of Calabria and Cape Spartivento, in July and November, respectively. During the latter engagement she briefly battled the British cruiser . Pola was thereafter reassigned to the 3rd Division, along with her three sister ships. The ship took part in the Battle of Cape Matapan in late March 1941. During the battle, she was disabled by a British airstrike. Later, in a fierce night engagement in the early hours of 29 March, Pola, Zara, Fiume, and two destroyers were sunk by the British Mediterranean Fleet with heavy loss of life. Design Pola was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . She displaced at full load, though her displacement was nominally within the restriction set in place by the Washington Naval Treaty. Her power plant consisted of two Parsons steam turbines powered by eight oil-fired Yarrow boilers, which were trunked into two funnels amidships. Her engines were rated at and produced a top speed of . She had a crew of 841 officers and enlisted men.Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 292 Pola was designed to function as a squadron flagship, and so her forward superstructure was larger than that of her sisters, and was faired into the forward funnel. She was protected with an armored belt that was thick amidships. Her armor deck was thick in the central portion of the ship and reduced to at either end. The gun turrets had 150 mm thick plating on the faces and the barbettes they sat in were also 150 mm thick. The main conning tower had 150 mm thick sides. Pola was armed with a main battery of eight Mod 29 53-caliber guns in four gun turrets. The turrets were arranged in superfiring pairs forward and aft. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by a battery of sixteen 47-cal. guns in twin mounts, four Vickers- Terni 40 mm/39 guns in single mounts and eight guns in twin mounts. She carried a pair of IMAM Ro.43 seaplanes for aerial reconnaissance; the hangar was located under the forecastle and a fixed catapult was mounted on the centerline at the bow.Brescia, p. 76 Polas secondary battery was revised several times during her career. Two of the 100 mm guns and all of the 40 mm and 12.7 mm guns were removed in the late 1930s and eight 54-cal. guns and eight guns were installed in their place. Two 15-cal. star shell guns were added in 1940. History Pola (third from right) along with Zara and Fiume in Naples in 1938 Pola, named for the eponymous city seized by Italy after World War I, was laid down at the Odero-Terni-Orlando shipyard in Livorno on 17 March 1931 and was launched on 5 December that year. Fitting-out work proceeded quickly, and the new cruiser entered service just over a year later on 21 December 1932. Pola participated in a naval review in the Gulf of Naples, where she hosted Italy's fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini, on 6-7 July 1933. On 29 July 1934 she was formally given her battle flag in a ceremony in her namesake city. On 3 September 1936 she left Gaeta, bound for Spanish waters; she thereafter began a non-intervention patrol during the Spanish Civil War. From 10 September to 3 October, she was stationed in Palma de Mallorca to safeguard Italian interests there. Pola returned to Gaeta on 4 October.Hogg & Wiper, p. 54 Pola went on a short cruise to Italian Libya on 10-12 March 1937, with Mussolini and Prince Luigi Amedeo aboard. On 7 June, she took part in a naval review in the Gulf of Naples held for the visiting German Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg. Another review took place on 5 May 1938 when the German dictator Adolf Hitler made a state visit to Italy. On 7 March 1939, Pola and her sisterships sortied from Taranto to intercept a squadron of Republican warships--three cruisers and eight destroyers-- attempting to reach the Black Sea. The Italian ships were ordered not to open fire but merely to try to impede the progress of the Spanish ships and force them to dock at Augusta, Sicily. The Spanish commander refused and instead steamed to Bizerte in French Tunisia, where his ships were interned.Hogg & Wiper, p. 18 The next month, on 7-9 April, Pola provided gunfire support to Italian forces occupying Albania. World War II At Italy's entrance into the Second World War on 10 June 1940, Pola was assigned as the flagship of Admiral Riccardo Paladini, commander of the 2nd Squadron, which also included the three s in the 2nd Division, three light cruisers in the 7th Division, and seventeen destroyers.Brescia, pp. 42-43 Polas first wartime operation was to cover a group of minelayers on the night of 10-11 June.Rohwer, p. 26 She refueled at Messina and departed on 12 June, along with the rest of the 2nd Squadron and the 1st Squadron. The ships sortied in response to British attacks on Italian positions in Libya.Rohwer, p. 28 On 6 July, Pola and the rest of the 2nd Squadron escorted a convoy bound for North Africa; the following day, Italian reconnaissance reported a British cruiser squadron to have arrived in Malta. The Italian naval high command therefore ordered several other cruisers and destroyers from the 1st Squadron to join the escort for the convoy. The battleships and provided distant support. Two days later, the Italian battleships briefly clashed with the British Mediterranean Fleet in an inconclusive action off Calabria.Rohwer, p. 32 During the action, Pola engaged British cruisers but neither side scored any hits. From 30 July to 1 August, Pola, , and escorted a convoy to Libya. On 16 August she conducted live fire training off Naples, and at the end of the month she was transferred from Naples to Taranto. In late September, the Italian fleet, including Pola, made a sweep for a British troop convoy from Alexandria to Malta, but it made no contact with the British ships.Rohwer, p. 43 On 1 November, Mussolini visited the ship in Taranto. Pola was present in the harbor at Taranto when the British fleet launched the nighttime carrier strike on Taranto on the night of 11-12 November, but she was not attacked in the raid.Lowry & Wellham, p. 119 She and the rest of the fleet left for Naples the following morning. Another attempt to intercept a British convoy in late November resulted in the Battle of Cape Spartivento. The Italian fleet left port on 26 November and while en route to the British fleet, Pola and the battleship were attacked by Swordfish torpedo bombers from the carrier , but both ships evaded the torpedoes. The two fleets then clashed in an engagement that lasted for about an hour. According to some sources, the two 203 mm hits on the British cruiser which disabled one of her main battery turrets were fired by Pola.Brescia, p. 77 Other authors state instead that Berwick was actually damaged by the main guns of Pola's sister, the heavy cruiser Fiume.Stern (2015), p. 60 Admiral Inigo Campioni broke off the action because he mistakenly believed he was facing a superior force, the result of poor aerial reconnaissance.Rohwer, p. 50 The Italian fleet was reorganized on 9 December, and Pola joined her three sister ships in the 3rd Division of the 1st Squadron, which was now commanded by Admiral Angelo Iachino.Rohwer, p. 51 On 14 December, a British air raid on Naples slightly damaged Pola.Rohwer, p. 52 Two bombs hit the ship, both amidships on the port side. The hits damaged three of the ship's boilers and caused significant flooding and a significant list to port. Pola was drydocked on 16 December for repair work that lasted until 7 February 1941. She returned to Taranto on 13 February, and she joined Zara and Fiume for extensive maneuvers off Taranto on 11-17 March. A nighttime training operation followed on 23-24 March. =Battle of Cape Matapan= Map of the movements of the Italian and British fleets during the Battle of Cape Matapan The Italian fleet made another attempt to intercept a British convoy in the eastern Mediterranean south of Crete in late March. This operation resulted in the Battle of Cape Matapan on 27-29 March. For most of the daytime engagement, Pola and the rest of the 3rd Division were stationed on the disengaged side of the Italian fleet, and so did not see action during this phase. Vittorio Veneto was torpedoed by British aircraft from the carrier and was forced to withdraw, and the 3rd Division remained on the port side of the Italian fleet to screen against another possible British attack.Bennett, pp. 121-124 A second British airstrike later in the day failed to locate the retiring Vittorio Veneto and instead scored a single torpedo strike on Pola, hitting her amidships on her starboard side. In the confusion of the attack, Pola had nearly collided with Fiume and had been forced to stop, which had prevented her from taking evasive action.O'Hara, p. 91 The damage filled three compartments with water and disabled five of her boilers and the main steam line that fed the turbines, leaving her immobilized and unable to use her main guns as the turrets were impossible to move due to the loss of power.Stephen, p. 61Giorgio Giorgerini, La guerra italiana sul Mare. La marina italiana fra vittoria e sconfitta 1940-1943, p. 305-313Giuseppe Fioravanzo, La Marina italiana nella seconda guerra mondiale - Le azioni navali nel Mediterraneo. Tomo I : Dal 10.6.1940 al 31.3.1941, p. 490 to 510. Iachino was unaware of Polas plight until 20:10 on 28 March; upon learning of the situation he detached Fiume, Zara, and four destroyers to protect Pola. At around the same time, the British cruiser detected Pola on her radar and reported her location.O'Hara, p. 92 The British fleet, centered on the battleships , , and , was at this point only away.Smith, p. 138 The British ships, guided by radar, closed in on the Italians; at 22:10, Pola was about from Valiant. Lookouts on the crippled Italian cruiser spotted shapes approaching and assumed them to be friendly vessels, so they fired a red flare to guide them. Almost twenty minutes later, the British illuminated first Zara and then Fiume with their searchlights; the British battleships obliterated Fiume, Zara, and two destroyers in a point-blank engagement.O'Hara, pp. 93-94 Pola initially was left alone during the action, and her captain, assuming that his ship would be the next target (and unable to return fire), ordered his crew to open the seacocks and abandon ship.O'Hara, p. 97 About ten minutes after midnight, the destroyer discovered Pola, still without power, in the darkness. A flotilla of British destroyers rushed to the scene, first discovering the abandoned Zara, which was still afloat; she was torpedoed and sunk by the destroyer . After picking up survivors, the destroyers joined Havock and a boarding party was prepared to take Pola, though it was discovered that most of her crew had jumped into the water, and the remaining men were huddled on the forecastle, ready to surrender. Jervis took off the surviving 22 officers and 236 enlisted men from Pola. Then the destroyer torpedoed the ship while Jervis illuminated her with her searchlights. Polas magazines exploded and she sank at 04:03 on 29 March.Rohwer, p. 66Bennett, pp. 129-131 A total of 328 men went down with the ship.

The phrase in ictu oculi is a Latin expression meaning \\"in the blink of an eye\\". One source is from the Bible, in 1 Corinthians 15:52: \\"In momento, in ictu oculi, in novissima tuba\\", translated in the KJV as \\"In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump:\\"1 Cor. 15:52, King James Version. Bible Gateway. where the Latin is itself a translation of the original Koine Greek phrase (en rhipƒìi ophthalmou).1 Cor. 15:52, SBL Greek New Testament. Bible Gateway. The phrase was used by Henry of Huntingdon on the rapid submission to the coronation of Stephen of England in 1135: Sine mora, sine labore, quasi in ictu oculi. It also appears as part of the text to a motet by Antoine Busnois entitled \\"Gaude celestis Domina\\". The most notable use of the phrase in an English text is that by John Donne: which shall be found alive upon the earth, we say there shall be a sudden death, and a sudden resurrection; In raptu, in transitu, in ictu oculi, where Donne gives an English-Latin paraphrase on the original context in 1 Corinthians 15. Works of art More than the original context of the phrase itself, the Latin may be better known as the title of a painting by Juan de Vald√©s Leal (4 May 1622 ‚Äì 1690). This painting, an allegory of death (c.1671), is one of two large still life allegorical vanitas paintings, high, by Vald√©s Leal, painted for the Charity Hospital of Seville. The central character is a skeleton; on the floor lies an open coffin and symbols of wealth and power. The skeleton extinguishes a candle which represents life, and above the taper is written the Latin motto. A volume of Rubens' designs for Antwerp's triumphal arches for the 1634 reception of the new Spanish governor, Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand, stands as a symbol of political disillusionment. The other painting of the pair is Finis Gloriae Mundi, \\"End of worldly glory,\\" which depicts a dead bishop and a knight. The painting is a reflection of the vanitas concept in Spanish music of the same period, as illustrated in in ictu oculi. M√∫sica espa√±ola del siglo XVII, a recording by the Spanish early music ensemble Los M√∫sicos de Su Alteza in 2002.

The duration of the units is not strictly defined and may vary according to the implementation, roughly in the range of 10 milliseconds up to 1 second. It is used in speech synthesis and music sound synthesis to generate user-specified sequences of sound from a database built from recordings of other sequences. In contrast to granular synthesis, concatenative synthesis is driven by an analysis of the source sound, in order to identify the units that best match the specified criterion. In speechIn music Concatenative synthesis for music started to develop in the 2000s in particular through the work of Schwarz and Pachet (so-called musaicing).

Armed with a main battery of eight guns, she was nominally within the limit imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty, though in reality she significantly exceeded this figure. Fiume saw extensive service during World War II, having participated in several sorties to catch British convoys in the Mediterranean. She was present during the Battle of Calabria in July 1940, Battle of Cape Spartivento in November, and ultimately the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941. In the last engagement, Fiume and her sister ships and were sunk in a close-range night engagement with three British battleships.

Her engines were rated at and produced a top speed of . She had a crew of 841 officers and enlisted men.Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 292 She was protected with an armored belt that was thick amidships. Her armor deck was thick in the central portion of the ship and reduced to at either end. The gun turrets had 150 mm thick plating on the faces and the barbettes they sat in were also 150 mm thick. The main conning tower had 150 mm thick sides. She was armed with a main battery of eight Mod 29 53-caliber guns in four gun turrets. The turrets were arranged in superfiring pairs forward and aft. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by a battery of sixteen 47-cal. guns in twin mounts, four Vickers- Terni 40 mm/39 guns in single mounts and eight guns in twin mounts. She carried a pair of IMAM Ro.43 seaplanes for aerial reconnaissance; the hangar was located in under the forecastle and a fixed catapult was mounted on the centerline at the bow.Brescia, p. 76 Fiumes secondary battery was revised several times during her career. Two of the 100 mm guns and all of the 40 mm and 12.7 mm guns were removed in the late 1930s and eight 54-cal. guns and eight guns were installed in their place. Two 15-cal. star shell guns were added in 1940. Service history Built in the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino in Trieste, Fiume was laid down on 29 April 1929, the first member of the class to be laid down. She was launched nearly a year later on 27 April 1930, the same day as her sister ship . Fitting-out work lasted another year and a half, and the new cruiser was commissioned into the Regia Marina (Royal Navy) on 23 November 1931. In January 1935, tests with autogyros were conducted aboard Fiume; a wooden platform was built on the stern of the ship to support the aircraft. The experiments proved to be successful, although the autogyros themselves had very limited range and were unreliable.Cernuschi & O'Hara, p. 68 Fiume took part in a lavish ceremony held for the visit of Adolf Hitler, the dictator of Nazi Germany, in May 1938. She and Zara conducted a gunnery demonstration while Hitler and the dictator of Italy, Benito Mussolini, observed from the battleship .Lowry & Wellham, p. 42 World War II Fiume (right) along with Zara and Pola in Naples When Italy formally joined the Second World War by declaring war on France and Britain on 10 June 1940, Fiume was assigned to the 1st Division with Zara and the four destroyers of the 9th Destroyer Flotilla. The unit was assigned to the 1st Squadron, under the command of Admiral Inigo Campioni.Brescia, p. 42 Two days later, Fiume and the rest of the 1st Division, along with the 9th Division, sortied in response to British attacks on Italian positions in Libya.Rohwer, p. 28 While they were at sea, the British submarine unsuccessfully attacked Fiume and her sister .Rohwer, p. 27 On 6 July, a convoy left Naples, bound for North Africa; the following day, Italian reconnaissance reported a British cruiser squadron to have arrived in Malta. The Italian naval high command therefore ordered the 1st Division and several other cruisers and destroyers to join the escort for the convoy. The battleships Conte di Cavour and provide distant support. Two days later, the Italian fleet briefly clashed with the British Mediterranean Fleet in an inconclusive action off Calabria.Rohwer, p. 32 In late September, the Italian fleet, including Fiume, made a sweep for a British troop convoy from Alexandria to Malta, but it made no contact with the British ships.Rohwer, p. 43 Fiume was present in the harbor at Taranto when the British fleet launched the nighttime carrier strike on Taranto on the night of 11-12 November, but she was not attacked in the raid.Lowry & Wellham, p. 119 Another attempt to intercept a British convoy in late November resulted in the Battle of Cape Spartivento. The Italian fleet left port on 26 November and clashed with the British fleet the next day, in an engagement that lasted for about an hour. Campioni broke off the action because he mistakenly believed he was facing a superior force, the result of poor aerial reconnaissance.Rohwer, p. 50 The British heavy cruiser HMS Berwick was hit twice by 203 mm rounds during the engagement, either fired by Fiume or her sister Pola.Stern, p. 60 =Battle of Cape Matapan= Map of the movements of the Italian and British fleets during the Battle of Cape Matapan The Italian fleet, now commanded by Admiral Angelo Iachino, made another attempt to intercept a British convoy in late March 1941. The fleet was supported by the Regia Aeronautica and the German 10th Air Corps.Garzke & Dulin, p. 384 This operation resulted in the Battle of Cape Matapan; early in the battle, Fiume and the rest of the 1st Division were to the northeast of the rest of the Italian fleet, which had encountered the British to the southwest. The battleship was torpedoed by British aircraft and forced to withdraw during this phase of the battle. The 1st Division remained on the port side of the Italian fleet as it began its return to port to screen against another possible British attack.Bennett, pp. 121-124 A second British airstrike later in the day failed to locate the retiring Vittorio Veneto and instead torpedoed Pola, which left the cruiser immobilized. Fiume, Zara, and four destroyers were detached to protect Pola.Garzke & Dulin, p. 388 The British fleet, centered on the battleships , , and , was at this point only away.Smith, p. 138 Guided by radar, the British fleet closed in on the crippled Pola in the darkness while Fiume, Zara, and the destroyers approached from the opposite direction. At 10:27, the searchlights aboard Warspite, the leading British battleship, illuminated Fiume at a range of , followed immediately by a salvo of six shells from her main battery; five struck Fiume and caused serious damage. Her superfiring rear turret was blown overboard before a second salvo from Warspite struck the ship. Shortly thereafter, Valiant fired four 15-inch shells into Fiume, causing further devastation. Fiume, now a burning wreck, was spared further destruction as the British battleships turned their attention to Zara. Fiume fell out of line, listing badly to starboard, as Zara was similarly hammered by 15-inch broadsides. Fiume remained afloat for about 45 minutes before she capsized and sank stern first at 23:15. Two of the destroyers, Alfieri and Carducci, were also sunk, as were Zara and Pola. The action had lasted a mere three minutes.Smith, pp. 139-141Bennett, pp. 125-131 812 men were lost with Fiume, among them her commanding officer Capt. Giorgio Giorgis; the survivors were picked up by British destroyers on the following morning, Greek destroyers in the evening of 29 March and the Italian hospital ship Gradisca between 31 March and 3 April.O'Hara, p. 97Cernuschi, Brescia & Bagnasco, p. 30Fioravanzo, pp. 480-481  Footnotes  References      Category:Zara-class cruisers Category:Ships built in Trieste Category:1931 ships Category:World War II cruisers of Italy Category:World War II shipwrecks in the Mediterranean Sea Category:Maritime incidents in March 1941 Category:Ships built by Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico ","title":"Italian cruiser Fiume"},{"id":"25815982","text":"Mohsin Naqvi (Urdu:ŸÖÿ≠ÿ≥ŸÜ ŸÜŸÇŸà€å)‚àí1996 1947) was a Pakistani poet, popular for his ghazals.

History St. Scholastica's Academy of Pampanga is the third Benedictine school established in the Philippines. Formerly known as the Assumption Academy, it was established in June 1925 in the house of the Singian family. The high school department was added in school year 1926-27. In March 1930, the first secondary graduates of the Assumption Academy were presented. The Alumni/Alumnae and present students of this school include sons/daughters and granddaughters/son of businessmen, politicians, and prominent figures in Pampanga. Due to the large number of enrollees, and the zeal of its biggest benefactor, Monsignor Prudencio David, the school was relocated to its second site in 1931, and ownership of the school was passed on to the Benedictine Sisters in 1938. With the outbreak of World War II, the building was used as a military hospital. In 1966, the school was renamed St. Scholastica's Academy of Pampanga. The school was transferred to a bigger site in 1972, leaving the old building without occupants. This school is exclusively for girls only but, due to the clamor of the parents of the female students, now, St. Scholastica's Academy (SSA) is accepting boys but only for grade school. Though recently, the school has plans on removing its girls-exclusive title and accepting boys in high school. But this is yet to be decided and as of now, a survey was conducted among the grade school boys if they want to continue their high school studies in St. Scholastica's Academy. In 1972, partly as a solution, the High School Department was transferred to the wide barren grounds in Cer-Hil, Quebiawan, five kilometers from the town proper. The previous match-like edifice has been expanded into an F-shaped building that houses the whole High School Department. A covered court with a stage, eating sheds, another building to house the Grade School Department and covered walks have been added through the combined efforts of the students, the alumnae, the PTA and the administration. On July 11, 1987, a building for the whole Grade School Department was blessed. The preschool later was transferred to a new building in 2001. The school has been recently renovated and the before F- shaped building of the high school department is now an E-shaped building to provide more classrooms for the students and on 2017 a new building was established to provide more rooms for the first batch of Grade 12 students. Beset by continuing threat of natural calamities prompted by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, SSA-SF was challenged to strengthen/further its social orientation through various curricular processes and continuing community involvement projects and activities. In 1992, it opened its door and provided temporary office for the Social Action Center of Pampanga (SACOP) and in 1994, it housed the lahar victims coming from various towns of Pampanga. The year after, SSA-SF shared its campus with Don Bosco Academy, the school which was totally buried in lahar. SSA-SF also suffered a tremendous drop in its enrollment in 1996 due to the devastation of lahar, but was able to recover the next year. Through all of these, SSA-SF continued its quest for excellence that in 1991, the High School Department was accredited by PAASCU and the Grade School Department in 2000 and 2014. Grade school The grade school's sections are named as follows: * 1st Grade: St. Agatha, St. Anne, St. Claire, St. Monica, St. Martha, St. Agnes, St. Cecilia * 2nd Grade: St. Peter, St. John, St. Mark, St. Matthew, St. Thomas, St. Andrew, St. Paul * 3rd Grade: St. Benedict, St. Joseph, St. Ignatius, St. Francis, St. Therese, St. Scholastica * 4th Grade: St. Boniface, St. Chrysostom, St. Bernard, St. Hilda, St. Odo, St. Placid, St. Maurus * 5th Grade: St. Camillus, St. Cyril, St. Celestine, St. Cyprian, St. Ireneaus, St. Clement, St. Otilia * 6th Grade: St. Lorenzo, St. Stephen, St. Gertrude, St. Augustine, St. Vincent, St. Lucy, St. Anthony High school The high school's sections are named as follows: * 7th Grade: Women in the Bible (Deborah, Esther, Judith, Miriam, Naomi, Ruth) * 8th Grade: Young Women Saints (St. Agnes, St. Bernadette, St. Cecilia, St. Clare, St. Ma.

In the school year 2017‚Äì2018, St. Elizabeth was removed due to depleted number of students in Grade 11 and only St. Amalberga is the pure STEM stranded section while the other four sections in Grade 12 are mixed STEM and ABM sections. In the school year 2016‚Äì2017, the school planned to expand its offered tracks in senior high school in the proceeding school year and as promised, for the next school year, General Academics (GA) and Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS) are now added for the senior high school.

It was founded in 1950 and has been run by different branches of the Religious Sisters of Mercy.  History  The school was founded in 1950 by Father Rodolfo Cabonce, S.J. with the assistance of Philippine Packing Corporation in obtaining the site and constructing the school. Initially, there was 54 first year students and 23 second year students taught by three teachers: Fathers Rodolfo Cabonce, Rafael Ocampo and Luis Meciano, all Jesuit priests, who also became members of the 1st Board of Trustees. During the succeeding 27 years of existence, the HCHS saw several changes in its administration and physical structure. A new wing was added to the original L-structure. More classrooms were constructed to accommodate a growing number of students. In 1960, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Newark, New Jersey took over the administration of the school. In 1973, the Religious Sisters of Mercy of Buffalo, New York were tasked to run the institution. It was during their term that the Guidance Program was introduced and the parents organized the Parents Auxiliary Council (PAC) which was later renamed PTA or Parents-Teachers Association. In 1975, the school experienced team administration. A revised secondary curriculum was implemented. The PPC- HCHS Industrial Arts program composed of Agriculture, Woodworking, Metal and Electricity was offered. In 1977, the responsibility of running the school was delegated to the Religious Sisters of Mercy of Cork, Ireland.

He was closely associated with the Anjuman-i Islam of Bombay from the 1930s till his death in November 1957. He was a Congress Member of Parliament in 1957 from Jalna in Maharashtra. Education & work Tyabji was grandson of an early president of India's Congress party, Badruddin Tyabji (1844‚Äì1906). Though he was an engineer educated at Cambridge, his career as a lawyer and a judge were perhaps surpassed by his role as a Member of Parliament representing the Congress party in newly independent India. He was in the forefront of reform of his own community. He realised the lack of English education amongst the Muslims had hurt them. He resolutely opposed the purdah system for Muslim women as it prevented their education and social advancement. In 1955 Tyabji wrote a series of essays in the influential Urdu newspaper Inquilab, which later were translated to English and published under the title, The Future of Muslims in India. He felt that Muslims should do a lot more than vote for India's dominant party - they should join it and influence its policies. Like other kinds of Indians, he felt Muslims had to \\"take an active part in the formation of a new Indian Culture\\". However, he noted \\"if Muslims sit back with folded arms, we can rest assured that the new Indian Culture will have little to do with the achievements of this country\\".

He won the award for Best Director at the 19th Yokohama Film Festival for Onibi and A Yakuza in Love. Life and career=Early career - Pink film Mochizuki was born in 1957 in the Shinjuku, Tokyo area of Tokyo. He attended Keio University in Tokyo but dropped out in his freshman year. After a round of bad-paying jobs, he eventually enrolled to study film at Tokyo's Image Forum. After graduating in the early 1980s, Mochizuki briefly worked at the Nikkatsu studio which was exclusively producing its Roman porno line of films at that time. Nikkatsu's fortunes were in decline, however, and Mochizuki was soon out of work. Mochizuki had been encouraged to write scripts by one of his teachers at Image Forum and in 1983, one of his screenplays was made into the pink film Virgin Rope Doll by Genji Nakamura for his Y≈´ Pro company. He continued working with Nakamura as a screenwriter and assistant director, including writing two gay-themed pink films, Beautiful Mystery: The Legend of Big Horn (a parody of Yukio Mishima's right-wing activities) and Our Season (a.k.a. Male Season) starring T≈çru Nakane.Sharp, p. 244 He made his debut as a director in 1985 with two pink films for Million Film, Real Performance Video: To Strip and Miss Masturbation: My Steamy Private Life. He also directed his first film for Nikkatsu in 1986, the melodramatic pink film Love Slave Doll: Make Me Come.Weisser, p. 256 Adult videos (AV) However, the pink film industry was in decline due to the rise of the adult video (AV) and Mochizuki decided to join the AV market, starting up his own production company, E-Staff Union (). With the difficulties of surviving in the Japanese film industry of the time, Mochizuki went into the AV business primarily to make some money while directing films and although he expressed some doubts about his choice he has said that if he \\"wanted to keep making them [films], it was either the sexy stuff or nothing.\\" In 1987, Mochizuki was directing AVs for Alice Japan, a company founded in 1986 as the adult video arm of Japan Home Video. He started the \\"Flashback\\" () series for Alice Japan in August 1987 and had produced Volume 30 in the series by December 1990 including one with the 1980s AV Idol Nao Saejima. In April 1990, he directed another early AV Idol, Yumika Hayashi, in the Alice Japan video The Contrary Soap Heaven 5 and he remained very active with Alice Japan through 1991. Mainstream film Mochizuki made his mainstream directorial debut in 1991 with the autobiographical Skinless Night produced by his own company E-Staff Union. The work revolves about a filmmaker from a background in pink film and now making AVs who is inspired by the discovery of an early student film of his to try to make an independent movie. The film, which showed more of the tedium of making adult videos than the glamor, was well received at festivals and the video distribution rights were picked up by Japan Home Video, the parent company of Alice Japan.Sharp, p. 244-245 With a new reputation as a mainstream director, Mochizuki filmed The Wicked Reporter for the Daiei studio in 1993. The commercial success of the film about a middle-aged boozing and gambling newspaperman (played by Eiji Okuda) led to two sequels in 1994 and 1996. Yakuza films In the last half of the 1990s, Mochizuki directed a series of yakuza movies that are considered his best work. Some of the films were a collaboration with novelist Yukio Yamanouchi who had once been a legal advisor to one of the yakuza syndicates. The first of the films, Another Lonely Hitman, about an old-time yakuza hitman who ends up battling his own gang, was released in 1995. The movie took the Best Film award at the 5th Japan Film Professional Awards and Mochizuki won the Best Director award. What critics consider his best film appeared in 1997, Onibi or The Fire Within, another study of an aging yakuza trying to go straight. Onibi won the Best Film award at the 19th Yokohama Film Festival and Mochizuki took the festival's Best Director award for this movie and his other 1997 film A Yakuza in Love. These were followed by the 1998 manga-based Mobster's Confession, a comical, cynical account of a small-time gangster and his girlfriend. By this time, Mochizuki had begun to attain an international reputation and the Rotterdam Film Festival held a ten-film retrospective on the director in 1998. Declining fortunes During the early 1990s, despite his entry into mainstream film, Mochizuki continued to produce hardcore pornographic videos as well, directing several entries in the Alice Japan series \\"Flash Paradise\\" (), working with actresses Rui Sakuragi, Riria Yoshikawa and Hitomi Shiraishi, among others. He also returned to his erotic film roots with his 2000 movie, Currency and Blonde, about a Japanese university lecturer and his sadomasochistic affair with his American lover. Critic Tom Mes sees this film, shot cheaply on video, as the start of a decline in the quality of Mochizuki's work. Much of his production in the 2000s was in the direct-to-video V-Cinema field, one exception being the 2000 pink film B-Grade Video Correspondent: AV Guy: Extraction Shop Ken, which won the 10th Best Film Award at the 2000 Pink Grand Prix. A more ambitious project was the 2004 mainstream film Kamachi, about a young poet and painter who died accidentally at the age of seventeen. His treatment, with hip-hop singer Shinya Taniuchi, who played the titular character, and actress Jun Fubuki, has been criticized as being superficial and romanticized. After the loss of his production company and the cancellation of other projects, Mochizuki returned to directing adult videos as well, with works in the 2000s for Alice Japan and Max-A, some featuring AV idols Milk Ichigo, Ry≈çko Mitake and Akiho Yoshizawa. Later career Mochizuki's 2005 film for the Toei Company studio, Wet Red Thread concerned two former prostitutes played by Saki Takaoka and Rei Yoshii looking to start a new life. After a gap of three years, Mochizuki directed another film for Toei, the erotic feature Johnen: Love of Sada, an alternate look at Sada Abe, whose story had been previously treated in the pink film A Woman Called Sada Abe and more famously in Nagisa Oshima's In the Realm of the Senses. In Mochizuki's version, a young photographer becomes obsessed with the married Sada (played by actress-dancer-singer Aya Sugimoto) and his affair with her brings back memories of a former life together with her. Sugimoto had created a scandal by her unfettered sexuality when starring in the 2004 S&M; cult film Flower and Snake and critic Mark Schilling compliments Mochizuki's style and casting for this film.

Epstein & Robert Axtell in their book Growing Artificial Societies. Origin Fundaments of Sugarscape models can be traced back to the University of Maryland where economist Thomas Schelling presented his paper titled Models of Segregation. Written in 1969, Schelling and the rest of the social environment modelling fraternity had their options limited by a lack of adequate computing power and an applicable programming mechanism to fully develop the potential of their model. John Conway's agent-based simulation \\"Game of Life\\" was enhanced and applied to Schelling's original idea by Joshua M. Epstein and Robert Axtell in their book Growing Artificial Societies. To demonstrate their findings on the field of agent-based simulation, a model was created and distributed with their book on CD-ROM. The concept of this model has come to be known as \\"the Sugarscape model\\". Since then, the name \\"Sugarscape\\" has been used for agent- based models using rules similar to those defined by Epstein & Axtell. Principles All Sugarscape models include the agents (inhabitants), the environment (a two-dimensional grid) and the rules governing the interaction of the agents with each other and the environment. The original model presented by J. Epstein & R. Axtell (considered as the first large scale agent model) is based on a 51x51 cell grid, where every cell can contain different amounts of sugar (or spice). In every step agents look around, find the closest cell filled with sugar, move and metabolize. They can leave pollution, die, reproduce, inherit sources, transfer information, trade or borrow sugar, generate immunity or transmit diseases - depending on the specific scenario and variables defined at the set-up of the model. Sugar in simulation could be seen as a metaphor for resources in an artificial world through which the examiner can study the effects of social dynamics such as evolution, marital status and inheritance on populations.(Retrieved from ABI/Inform Document ID: 347271391) Exact simulation of the original rules provided by J. Epstein & R. Axtell in their book can be problematic and it is not always possible to recreate the same results as those presented in Growing Artificial Societies. Model implementations The Sugarscape model has had several implementations, some of which are available as open source software. Ascape An original implementation was developed in Ascape, Java software suitable for agent-based social simulation. The Sugarscape model remains part of the built-in library of models distributed with Ascape. NetLogo NetLogo has been used to build Sugarscape models. Three Sugarscape scenarios are included in the NetLogo Models Library: \\"Immediate Growback\\", \\"Constant Growback\\" and \\"Wealth Distribution\\". Besides these three scenarios lies Iain Weaver's Sugarscape NetLogo model, which is part of the User Community Models Library. \\"It builds on Owen Densmore's NetLogo community model to encompass all rules discussed in Growing Artificial Societies with the exception of the combat rule (although trivial to include, it adds little value to the model).\\" The model is equipped with rich documentation including instructions for successful replication of the original Sugarscape rules. SugarScape on steroids Due to the emergent nature of agent-based models (ABMs), it is critical that the population sizes in the simulations match the population sizes of the dynamic systems being modelled. However, the performance of contemporary agent simulation frameworks has been inadequate to handle such large population sizes and parallel computing frameworks designed to run on computing clusters has been limited by available bandwidth. As computing power increases with Moore's law, the size and complexity of simulation frameworks can be expected to increase. The team of R. M. D‚ÄôSouza, M. Lysenko and K Rahmani from Michigan Technological University used a Sugarscape model to demonstrate the power of Graphics processing units (GPU) in ABM simulations with over 50 updates per second with agent populations exceeding 2 million.(See also: presentation slides) Mathematica Another implementation can be found written in Mathematica. MASON GMU's MASON project, available under the Academic Free License, also includes an implementation of Sugarscape.

It was the first of the confessions magazines genre, having launched in 1919. It carried the subtitle Truth Is Stranger Than Fiction. Content With a circulation of 300,000 by 1923, the trend-setting publication remained a huge success through the 1920s and was a key title in Bernarr Macfadden's publishing empire of Physical Culture, True Detective, True Romances, Dream World, True Ghost Stories, Photoplay and the tabloid New York Graphic. It sprang from Physical Culture, stemming from the many letters written the magazine by women about their experiences.Roland Marchand, Advertising the American Dream: Making Way For Modernity 1920-40 p53-4 By 1929, the circulation of True Story was nearly two million.Hatton, Jackie. St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture, January 29, 2002.Bernarr Macfadden True Story offered anecdotal experiences, and the articles it presented, rewritten by staffers, were purportedly true. However, by the mid-1920s, many stories were professional submissions from fiction writers or were staff-written by Macfadden's stable of writers, including Fulton Oursler and Lyon Mearson. The language was kept relentlessly simple; Mcfadden would test language on the elevator operator, and reject whatever he could not understand. Articles were illustrated with photographs of posed models, breaking away from the idealistic illustration common in magazines.Roland Marchand, Advertising the American Dream: Making Way For Modernity 1920-40 p54 The magazine's approach and its audience were detailed by Jackie Hatton: :Sensing a widespread interest in the changing social/sexual codes of modern America, Macfadden put out a new magazine filled with first-hand accounts of social problems such as pre-marital sex, illegitimacy, adultery, unemployment, social relations, and crime (alongside ever-so slightly risque movie-stills of each story's most dramatic moments---the kiss, the temptation, the horrible realization). The magazine personalized issues that were hotly debated in Jazz Age America (dancing, drinking, partying, petting) and offered a unique working-class perspective on issues that were not necessarily unique to the working class. Sensational, emotional, and controversial, True Story disseminated tales of sex, sin and redemption that seemingly revealed the ubiquity of modern sexual and social \\"irregularity.\\" Most educated observers hated the magazine, figuring that it depicted the worst aspect of the \\"revolution in manners and morals\\" that occurred in the 1920s. But workaday America loved the new confessional magazine. The formula has been characterized as \\"sin-suffer- repent\\": the heroine violates standards of behavior, suffers as a consequence, learns her lesson and resolves to live in light of it, unembittered by her pain.Maureen Honey, Creating Rosie the Riveter: Class, Gender and Propaganda during World War II, p 141-43, Advertisers were at first reluctant to buy ads, even as the circulation grew, but by 1928, many major companies placed ads, which copied the style of \\"short words and shorter sentences\\" and also imitated the sensational style.Roland Marchand, Advertising the American Dream: Making Way For Modernity 1920-40 p56 \\"Because I Confessed. . . I found the Way To Happiness\\" titled an Eagle Brand Condensed Sweetened Milk ad for a cookbook; the title character confessed to a married friend that a man would never propose to her because he wanted a good girl, who could cook, and received the advertised cookbook as a loan, using it to win him.Roland Marchand, Advertising the American Dream: Making Way For Modernity 1920-40 p57 \\"Some Wives Do It, But I Wouldn't Dare\\" advertised Wheatena; the narrator would never dare send her husband off without a good breakfast.Roland Marchand, Advertising the American Dream: Making Way For Modernity 1920-40 p58 1930s and 40s During the Great Depression, the emphasis lay on feminine behavior, maternity, marriage, and stoic endurance.Maureen Honey, Creating Rosie the Riveter: Class, Gender and Propaganda during World War II, p 144, Women who dedicated themselves to work were unable to marry or maintain a happy marriage; women who remained independent could not conceive or suffered miscarriages and stillbirths.Maureen Honey, Creating Rosie the Riveter: Class, Gender and Propaganda during World War II, p 145-6, With the outbreak of World War II, the stories began to feature war work favorably.Maureen Honey, Creating Rosie the Riveter: Class, Gender and Propaganda during World War II, p 150, However, it continued the sexual themes, such as having war workers be seduced, have affairs with married men, or engage in many casual affairs; the Magazine Bureau objected to this, as hindering recruitment, and argued that war workers should not be shown as more prone to dalliance than other women, and the magazine removed such themes from stories dealing with war workers.Maureen Honey, Creating Rosie the Riveter: Class, Gender and Propaganda during World War II, p 154-5, The ambitious career woman still appeared; women, however, who worked from patriotic motives were able to maintain their marriages and bear children.Maureen Honey, Creating Rosie the Riveter: Class, Gender and Propaganda during World War II, p 164, During post-war reconversion, the emphasis changed to marriage and motherhood.Maureen Honey, Creating Rosie the Riveter: Class, Gender and Propaganda during World War II, p 168, 1950s editions In the 1950s, themes changed again, now employing more stories involving teenage girls reflecting on their \\"lot in life\\" and the outcomes of their poor life choices. Many of the \\"True Story of the Month\\" featured girls who had married young, and had married wrongly. These tales included hostile in-laws, brutal living conditions and feelings of hopelessness and reached resolution when the person telling the story accepted her situation and promised to accept her position in life for the sake of her family. The magazine spoke out loudly on the issue of abortion (it was against it), birth control (against it because it led to situations in which girls could be taken advantage of) and the duties of raising children with profound developmental issues. Advice columns, a regular feature, were written by True Story \\"authority\\" \\"Helen Willman.\\" Marital advice, under the title \\"The Marriage Desk,\\" was given by \\"Dr. Lena Levine, M.D.\\" The columns glossed over issues of physical abuse toward women by the men that they had chosen as their boyfriends and husbands. The physical abuse was often rationalized as the letter writers' fault for not understanding their boyfriends/husbands' needs. In one notable 1956 response to a \\"letter from a reader\\" who asked why her husband beat her when he came home from work, the magazines response from \\"Helen Willman\\" advised the writer that she needed to understand that \\"your husband works hard,\\" and when he returned from work he \\"doesn't want or need her burdening her husband with her needs,\\" but that she should better serve her husband and keep the children quiet so he can relax. \\"Try not to complain,\\" wrote Willman. The 1950s also brought about double page color photographs posed in dramatic fashions, which played to the leading titles given the works. Goods advertised in True Story in the 1950s were relied heavily on inexpensive beauty treatments (shampoos, toothpaste, creams, feminine hygiene products) and inexpensive kitchen remodeling projects and appliances. The backs of the magazines were heavily filled with \\"penny ads\\" for correspondence courses in nursing, dog grooming, hotel management and holiday card sales. The magazine relied on single and triple column layouts, printed upon folios of inexpensive papers that alternated between heavy newsprint and low weight, low luster paper used for color print sections. Stories often started in the second section of the magazine, usually with dramatic photographs, and then readers had to flip to the rear of the magazine to complete the articles. Articles were tagged as \\"True Story of the Month\\", \\"Award Winning Story\\" and \\"Special Double Article\\" headers. Who or what gave the award to the story was never disclosed. Editorial history From 1919 to 1926, John Brennan Willian edited True Story. Jordan Rapp was the editor from 1926 to 1942, serving under Editor-in-Chief Henry Lieferant. Macfadden's consumer division merged with Sterling's Magazines in 1991; Dorchester Media acquired Sterling/Macfadden in 2004. True Renditions, LLC, acquired True Story and additional confession magazines from Dorchester Media on March 9, 2012. The headquarters of True Story is in New York City. Radio True Story was the basis for a radio series, The True Story Court of Human Relations, produced by an advertising agency to promote the magazine. The program was directed by radio historian Erik Barnouw and broadcast live on NBC beginning in 1935 and continuing through the 1930s. British edition The UK edition of True Story duplicated the American magazine but also added British material. It was first published by Hutchinson's in 1922. The Argus Press became the publisher in 1949.

Its distribution was once wider; it has also been collected from a tributary of the Clinch River in Tennessee. This minnow is up to in length. It is very slender and cylindrical in shape. It is straw-colored with dark margins on some of its rear scales. There is a dark, silvery lateral stripe and a spot near the tail. A pale stripe runs above the dark lateral line, giving the fish its name. This fish lives in flowing streams with clear water and rocky, sandy bottoms. Little is known about the ecology of the species. The species spawns in late spring and summer; little else is known about its reproduction. This species is a widely disjunct distribution, with two isolated populations located far apart. Its range may have become reduced long ago or it may owe its rarity to more current, degraded conditions in its habitat, or both. Its extirpation from Tennessee was caused by coal mining pollution and the construction of reservoirs.  References External links *Froese, R. and D. Pauly. (Eds.) Notropis albizonatus.

The current Acting Director is Walter A. Grudzinskas. Mission The mission of the Air Force History and Museums Program is to improve combat capability through the collection, preservation, interpretation, dissemination and display of historical information, artifacts and AF heritage to commanders and the public. The worldwide history program consists of more than 200 Air Force historians. They write the annual wing, numbered air force and major command histories that document all Air Force activities. The Office of Air Force History, located at the Pentagon, Arlington, VA, provides policy, guidance, and advocacy for the worldwide program. The Air Force Historical Studies Office,located on Joint Base Anacostia Bolling, Washington, DC, is the book writing element of the history program. It researches, writes, and publishes historical books, monographs, and special studies, and provides historical information and research assistance primarily in support of the Air Staff. The Air Force Historical Research Agency, located at Maxwell Air Force Base, Ala., maintains the 100+ million pages of official Air Force archives. The National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, which hosts more than 1.5 million visitors a year, collects, restores and displays air and space craft, a legacy that spans more than a century of military flight.https://www.my.af.mil/gcss- af/USAF/ep/contentView.do?contentType=EDITORIAL&contentId;=c6925EC1960610FB5E044080020E329A9&channelPageId;=s6925EC13550C0FB5E044080020E329A9&programId;=t6925EC2BF1060FB5E044080020E329A9 Air Force historians Air Force historians work at every level of the Air Force command structure, collecting information within their organization. Echelons down to the wing (and some groups) have formal historian positions, echelongs below the wing have members who perform historian work as an additional duty. Today, historians are Department of the Air Force historians, while the United States Air Force Reserve maintains enlisted historians. Background In 1943, the U.S. Army Air Forces established the Historical Division under the Assistant Chief of Air Staff for Intelligence to gain an accurate and objective account of World War II experiences. Since then, historians have been responsible for creating official records of each echelon of the Air Force, from individual squadrons to the Department of the Air Force. Duty position Around 2005, most uniformed Historian positions-- Air Force Specialty Code 3H0X1‚Äîwere replaced by civilian government service positions, sometimes held by individuals who previously worked as 3H0X1 while in uniform but then retired or separated. Both types of historian, uniformed and civilian, can be deployed to an expeditionary unit to collect data and record events as they occur. Historians have been deployed during Operations Allied Force, Desert Shield/Desert Storm, Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. Historians have also deployed in support of humanitarian operations. While it was an enlisted position in uniform with no education requirement, the civilian position requires a degree in History, or a similar degree with 18 credit hours in history. General responsibilities Air Force historians maintain the Air Force legacy. During combat operations, they provide information and analysis for current operations as well as records and interpretation for when the operation ends. While obviously useful in recording wartime data, they also record peacetime operations, such as humanitarian relief missions, bringing food and medical supplies to disaster areas, or training events that lead to better mission capabilities.http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123099455 Higher- headquarters historian duties Higher-headquarters historians help provide historical perspective to assist decision makers and commanders. They provide data for manning authorization plans, environmental studies, or decision- making scenarios. They are also responsible for managing collection and compilation of subordinate unit histories. Lower-Echelon historian duties At squadron and wing echelons, historians compile perishable information such as combat records and data. They can conduct post-combat mission interviews, document significant achievements or events and prepare studies on special topics. Their main responsibility lies in creating annual narratives and an official record of the unit's accomplishments.

Career Santiago Soldati was born to Francisco Soldati, a nephew of the founder of the Villa Lugano neighborhood of Buenos Aires, Jos√© Francisco Soldati, and the owner of the city's largest utility, the Italian-Argentine Electric Company.Swiss Info: Villa Lugano His father bought controlling interest in Sociedad Comercial del Plata (SCP), a holding company with varied interests, primarily real estate, in 1965, and expanded the company into petroleum transport.New York Times: The Big Push Toward Privatization in Argentina Raised in a family of Swiss descent (Jos√© Francisco had been born in Lugano), Soldati was educated in Switzerland.Portal Uno: Soldati anunci√≥ su retiro The family's growing prominence made them a target to left-wing extremism during the 1970s, however, and in April 1973, Santiago Soldati was kidnapped by the Montoneros, who released him after payment of a US$1.5 million ransom. His father ultimately lost his life in a November 1979 bombing carried out by the same group, in one of their last attacks.Lewis, Paul. Guerrillas and Generals. Praeger Publishers, 2002. He became President of SCP when his elder brother, Francisco, died in a polo accident in 1991. Soldati took control of SCP at a time when Argentine President Carlos Menem and Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo were advancing an ambitious privatizations policy. SCP became a minority shareholder in newly privatized television, telephone, natural gas, electricity, freight rail services, as well as the metro Buenos Aires water utility. These became Telef√©, Telef√≥nica de Argentina, Transportadora del Gas del Norte, Transener, Ferroexpreso Pampeano and Aguas Argentinas, respectively, during the early 1990s.Cr√≠tica de la Argentina: Soldati, el lobbysta de la Barrick Gold Soldati invested part of his diversified earnings into two tourist attractions: the Tren de la Costa railway, and the Parque de la Costa amusement park. The first he developed by securing a concession in 1993 to operate the formerly state-owned Ferrocarril Central Argentino route between the northern Buenos Aires suburbs of Olivos and Tigre, in disuse since 1961. Following the recovery of derelict rails and stations, and the purchase of new equipment, the 16 km (10 mi) \\"Coastal Train\\" was inaugurated in April 1995, helping revive the largely upscale area's real estate market.Historia del Tren de la Costa Soldati was elected President of the Argentine Business Council, for a two-year term, in 1997. As the largest shareholder in Aguas Argentinas (with 20 percent), SCP profited by Soldati's decision in 1998 to sell its stake to Paris-based Suez, which paid SCP US$150 million for its shares, or three times what Soldati's company had paid in 1993.Santoro, Daniel. The Aguas Tango. February 6, 2003. The sale of the profitable unit was partly motivated by growing debts at SCP, however, whose revenue forecast was dampened by the local effects during 1995-96 of the Mexican peso crisis. Its US$715 million debt was nearly double its book value, and in 1997, SCP divested itself of the natural gas processing concerns had under its Compa√±√≠a General de Combustibles (CGC) unit for US$230 million, most of which had to be earmarked for debt retirement.Bradynet: Sociedad Comercial del Plata Controlling CPC, the nation's second-largest construction company, Soldati shed a half ownership stake in the builder, as well as 100% of the Ban gas company, by 1998. SCP, however, defaulted on a US$25 million debt in April 1999, which effectively shut it out of the corporate bond market. The principal drain on the group's finances had reportedly been its US$400 million investment in the two, suburban Buenos Aires tourist attractions: the Tren and Parque de la Costa, which were operated at a loss, and whose startup debt became difficult to service.La Naci√≥n: Soldati no pudo pagar una deuda de US $ 25 millones Negotiations with creditors followed, but a lawsuit filed against SCP by US-based Reef Exploration in 2000 over the sale of a subsidiary to Shell Petroleum led to Soldati's decision to file for SCP's bankruptcy in September of that year.P√°gina/12: Anochecer de Soldati The sale of a number of energy related interests to Techint, the Argentine multinational registered in Luxembourg, could not rescue SCP from bankruptcy, and in 2004, Soldati divested it of 81% of its CGC unit, which was sold to local household chemicals maker TVB.Ambientalistas: Jabon sucio That year, SCP's bankruptcy was approved in court, which granted it an 80% discharge of a debt which had grown to US$1.2 billion, by then.Fortuna: La Corte Suprema revoc√≥ el concurso de acreedores de Comercial del Plata The discharge allowed SCP to enter into a modest venture with Millicom, a Luxembourg-based mobile phone network provider,Clar√≠n: El grupo Soldati, otra vez de compras which resulted in Latin America's first WiMax network.Wi-Fi Planet: Millicom Argentina Announces WiMax Network A personal friend of British businessman Peter Munk, Soldati lobbied in favor of Barrick Gold during 2009. Barrick, the gold mining giant co-founded by Munk in 1983, had been exploring a potentially large deposit straddling the Argentina-Chile border along the Andes mountain range, and ultimately obtained approval to mine the Pascua Lama field from both jurisdictions.National Post: Barrick's Pascua Lama Gets the Go-Ahead SCP's legal problems continued, however, as the bankruptcy ruling had been appealed by a commercial court prosecutor in 2006,iProfessional: Rev√©s judicial para el concurso de Sociedad Comercial del Plata and in October 2009, the Argentine Supreme Court struck down the earlier ruling, citing irregularities in the shareholders' meeting convened to approve the bankruptcy.

Response of the Devil‚Äôs River (Texas) fish community to flooding. Copeia 1978(1):60-68  Biology = Spawning season  In Texas, February through September.Craig, Cody A., Bradley M. Littrell, and Timothy H. Bonner. \\"Population Status and Life History Attributes of the Texas Shiner Notropis amabilis.\\" The American Midland Naturalist 177.2 (2017): 277-288. Collection of specimens, in Texas, less than 20 mm (0.79 in) SL from mid-April to mid- December, suggests spawning begins in approximately late March and continues through approximately mid-November. In Mexico, N. amabilis evidently spawns over a protracted period from early spring into summer.Miller, R. R., W. L. Minckley and S. M. Norris. 2005. Freshwater Fishes of Mexico. The University of Chicago Press. Chicago, IL. pp 131-32.  Fecundity  Oocyte diameters exhibited a trimodal distribution suggesting development of multiple cohorts throughout the spawning season. In October mature ovaries present in three of fourteen females collected; all ovaries classified as mature or resting in individuals collected in November and December. As early as January, 24% of females collected contained developing ovaries; mature ovaries first appeared in February in 17% of females; in April, 75% of females contained mature ovaries; May‚ÄìJuly, mature ovaries found in 25-31% of females; reproduction peaked again in August and September when 86% and 71% of females, respectively, contained mature ovaries. Clutch size ranged from 102 to 286 with a mean (¬±SD) of 174.5 (62.2;).  Food Habits  Gut contents suggest species is an invertivore drift predator (Goldstein and Simon 1999) feeding primarily in the water column on aquatic insects. Common food items were aquatic insects (71%) and algae (61%); among aquatic insects, mayflies were most abundant (31% of insects), caddisflies (26%), flies/midges (22%), beatles (12%), and moths/butterflies (4%); terrestrial insects found in 6% of guts, comprising 5% of all insect taxa identified; sediment and detritus found in 13% of Notropis amabilis examined. In Devil's River, Texas, observed feeding near the surface. The few specimens collected contained terrestrial insects during the summer; no other information about the food habits is known.  Phylogeny and Paleobiogeography  In (Craig et al. 2017) \\"Texas Shiner is in the subgenus Notropis and its closest extant relatives are Rio Grande Shiner Notropis jemezanus, Sharpnose Shiner Notropis oxyrhynchus, and Emerald Shiner Notropis atherinoides (Bielawski and Gold, 2001). Although the paleobiogeography of Texas Shiner is currently unclear, a proposed pathway of speciation is that the subgenus Notropis ancestor gained access to the Pecos River from the north through historical connections with eastern flowing drainages of the Southern Great Plains during the Neogene (Conner and Suttkus, 1986) or Quaternary (Echelle and Echelle, 1978) periods. A later derived ancestor of Texas Shiner and its closest phylogenetic relative Rio Grande Shiner (Bielawski and Gold, 2001) were exchanged through Pleistocene connectivity between the Pecos River and Edwards Plateau drainages (e.g., Colorado River) and eventually the Rio Grande drainage (Echelle and Echelle, 1978). During Pleistocene interglacial climates, the ancestral form of Texas Shiner became isolated in refugia of persistent spring complexes within the Edwards Plateau drainages (Coburn, 1982).\\"  Population status  As of 2017, populations of the Texas Shiner are currently secure. From (Craig et al. 2017) \\"Populations of Texas Shiners were temporally stable or increasing in six streams or stream reaches (Bonner et al., 2005; Runyan, 2007; Perkin et al., 2010; Kollaus et al., 2015) with abundances categorized as occasional (7 to 22% in relative abundances) to frequent (30 to 37%) in 10 other streams or stream reaches among five drainages (Colorado River, Guadalupe River, San Antonio River, Nueces River, Pecos River, and Rio Grande). Texas Shiners are not reported recently in three streams or stream reaches. Lack of recent collection in the San Gabriel River (Brazos River drainage) might be attributed to extirpation events or incorrect listing of the Brazos River drainage as part of Texas Shiner's range. Historical occurrences of Texas Shiners in the Brazos River drainage are under review by others (Hendrickson and Cohen, pers. comm.). Lack of recent collection of Texas Shiners and other native fishes in urbanized Barton Creek (Colorado River drainage) is associated with instream and downstream dams and nonnative fishes (Labay et al., 2011). However, other spring-associated fishes (e.g., native Etheostoma lepidum and nonnative Astyanax mexicanus) persist in Barton Creek. Texas Shiners were reported in the upper San Antonio River, another urbanized stream reach, as recent as 2000 (Edwards et al., 2001), but specimens were not taken in 2012 to 2013 (Craig and Bonner, in review). Upper San Antonio River has long history of water quality and water quantity concerns, along with nonnative species introductions. Despite two possible extirpation events in urban streams and possibly a third in a Brazos River drainage, populations of Texas Shiner temporally persist with occasional and frequent abundances among multiple and independent streams, stream reaches, and drainages. Therefore, we conclude the conservation status of the Texas Shiner is currently secure.
