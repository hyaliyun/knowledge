Their youngest son, Henry Chau Hoi- leung (, 28 at the time of the murder), and his friend Angus Tse Chun-kei (, 35 at the time of the murder), were indicted for the murder, which they initially denied being involved in. During Chau and Tse's interviews with the police, they admitted that after the murder, they chopped up the parents' dead bodies and cooked the remains with salt to make them look \\"like barbecue pork.\\" They kept part of the remains in lunch boxes, which they stored in the refrigerator. The gruesome details of the murder sparked a huge amount of media coverage in Hong Kong. On 20 March 2015, High Court deputy judge Michael Stuart-Moore found Chau guilty of double murder while finding his accomplice Tse not guilty on both counts of murder. Timeline of events On 12 March 2013, five days after filing a missing persons report, the two Chau brothers heard from the police that there were no (departure) records of their parents leaving Hong Kong. Thus on 13 March 2013, Henry Chau Hoi-leung and his older brother approached Apple Daily, claiming that they had not heard from their parents since 2 March. Chau stated that before their disappearance, his parents had informed him that they were planning to travel to mainland China. The brothers then created a Facebook page titled, \\"My missing dad and mom\\", and asked their friends and the public for any information that could link to their parents' whereabouts. On 14 March 2013, Henry Chau was invited to the police station for further questioning. Apple Daily released articles about the Chau brothers' struggle to find their missing parents. During the police interview, Chau texted his friends in a WhatsApp group \\"HK-Tekken\\" and confessed to the crime. Chau even described the details and reasons for the murder. On 15 March 2013, a day after the interview, Chau and his friend, Angus Tse Chun-kei, were indicted for killing and dismembering Chau's parents in Tse's Tai Kok Tsui flat in the Long Beach Building. According to reports, Chau invited his parents to visit Tse's flat, telling them that it was a new flat he had just rented, and murdered his parents with Tse.  Deaths of Glory Chau and Moon Siu  During further interrogation and investigation, Chau claimed that he and Tse coordinated the attack the moment Glory Chau and Moon Siu arrived in the living room because this was the time \\"when they felt ready.\\" Chau described his accomplice Tse as a \\"very powerful\\" man who covered Moon Siu's mouth from behind while slashing her throat. Henry Chau admitted to stabbing his father in the back of the neck, but stated Tse had finished the job by slashing Glory Chau's throat. The autopsy report further confirmed the cause of death. Chau returned to the Tai Kok Tsui crime scene four days after the incident, at the time when Tse already had all the body parts dismembered, salted, refrigerated, and demoisturized. Chau described his role in the double murder as 'killing only', while Tse dismembered the bodies. According to Chau, Tse initially attempted to disguise the remains as bricks by covering them with cement and sand. Then he came up with an easier plan to cook the remains of the bodies and disguise them as char siu, barbecued pork. Some of the remains were also covered with sand and thrown into the sea. During the investigation held on 15 March 2013, the heads of the two victims were found inside the two separate refrigerators. In those refrigerators, lunch boxes containing microwaved human flesh, and three bags containing chopped limbs and other body parts were found. According to the video interviews shown to the jury, Chau said that his father was \\"an arrogant man who left [Chau] without a moment of peace\\" while his mother \\"always looked sadly when [Chau] did not contribute to the family.\\" \\"I thought that if I could resolve the emotional connection with my parents, it would be a solution,\\" he said. \\"If they died, I could be reborn.\\" He blamed his parents for his failures in life, such as his father distracting his studies by watching television at a high volume, and his mother forcing him to practice the piano and humiliating him in front of a girl. Trial proceedings The Court of First Instance began the first hearing on 4 August 2014, with both Chau and Tse as the defendants. The initial jury of seven was reduced to six during the first week of testimony. Soon after, another jury member asked for dismissal due to the psychological stress burdening him. On 13 August 2014, High Court Deputy Judge Michael Stuart-Moore announced that the case would have to be restarted with a fresh jury of nine. The trial resumed in February 2015. Throughout the course of the trial, Chau's defense argued on the basis of diminished responsibility due to his mental instability, while the prosecution stressed the meticulous planning of Henry Chau and his multiple confessions. On 9 March 2015, the defense lawyer, Nicholas Adams, called psychiatrist Chung Ka-fai to the stand. Chung diagnosed Chau with bipolar disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Chung stated that Chau had experienced many suicidal thoughts after dropping out of college, being rejected by women, and being unemployed, giving a possible psychological trigger for the murder. The consultant of Siu Lam Psychiatric Centre, Lui Sing-Heung, conducted an IQ test for Tse and Chau. Chau's IQ was found to be 126, higher than average, while Tse's IQ is 84. Lui argued the possibility that Chau, having such a higher IQ than Tse, could have manipulated and framed Tse for the murder. On 20 March 2015, the verdict was passed. High Court deputy judge Michael Stuart-Moore found Chau guilty of double murder while finding his accomplice Tse not guilty on both counts of murder. Chau was sentenced to life imprisonment while Tse was sentenced to one year for preventing the lawful burial of the bodies. As Tse had already been detained for two years on remand, he was released immediately.  In popular culture  The case was adapted into an episode of the Chinese-language miniseries Stained (ÂøÉÂÜ§; debuted 2017) produced by Fox Networks Group Asia and directed by Patrick Kong. The case was also adapted in the TVB 2018 Anniversary drama OMG, Your Honour (ÊòØÂíÅÁöÑÔºåÊ≥ïÂÆòÈñ£‰∏ã) as the final case.

Flooding affects only the western part of the karst field, below Dane, which is uninhabited. In the past, more of the karst field used to flood, and so at the end of the 19th century a lower entrance was cut into the cave, which reduced the depth and duration of flooding. Settlements The settlements in the Lo≈æ Karst Field are relatively large and have a clustered or linear layout. Stari Trg pri Lo≈æu is the economic and cultural center of the area. Economic activity The karst field ranges between and in elevation and is surrounded by steep wooded slopes. The flat areas are used for tilled fields, and lower parts near the creeks for meadows. There are also meadows and pastures along the edges of the gentler slopes, especially on the sunny sides, where animal husbandry is practiced.

As the name implies, it is located between Tin Hau station and Fortress Hill station, on Electric Road, Wing Hing Street and Ching Fung Street. There are around 150 restaurants in the square serving many different styles of cuisine, including Chinese, Western, Thai, Japanese, and Korean. History Origin of the name Originally known as Tin Hau Food Street, the word \\"street\\" was abandoned in favor of \\"square\\" by a district councilor who was concerned that confusion might arise from the absence of square, park, or food court in the area. Origins ChingChing Dessert in Tin Hau Food Square Tin Hau Food Square was originally an ordinary residential area with very few restaurants. There were mostly stationery stores, hardware stores, pharmacies, bakeries, and Chinese grocery stores along Electric Road with garages and old furniture stores in the side streets, which include Tsing Fung Street and Lau Li Street. The person who initiated the catering business in Tin Hau, Mr. Wong, the owner of a Chinese dessert shop, opened his dessert shop, Ching Ching Dessert () twenty years ago after moving to Tin Hau. People could sit inside or outside the shop to enjoy their desserts, and customers with cars could simply park outside the shop. Over the past decade, people have chosen Tin Hau as a potential location to start their businesses based on the successful experience of Ching Ching Dessert. Current development Many hotels and apartments have been built near Tin Hau Food Square in recent years. Therefore, tourists and foreigners are another source of customers. People who are interested in opening restaurants in Causeway Bay have also recently begun shifting to Tin Hau, which has relatively lower rents. The large number of food stores makes Tin Hau Food Square attractive to people who go out for dinner, desserts, and late night meals () throughout the whole year. Features The most distinctive characteristic of the Food Square is its large number of dessert houses. There are not only traditional desserts such as dumplings and black sesame soup, but also learned and imported desserts from other countries in order to attract more customers. Most of the desserts use fruit and chocolate as their main ingredients, such as the Mango cream dumplings and chocolate souffl√©, which are very popular among younger customers. Apart from desserts, foreign snacks such as fried chicken fillet from Taiwan are also common. With the increasing number of food stores and their popularity among the people of Hong Kong people, the district councilors have decided to develop this area as a tourist attraction, using around $13,000,000 for beautification. Promotion via media and the insertion of flags and statues as a kind of landmark will also be included to boost tourism and maintain the unique features of the area. Challenges High rents One of the challenges for stores located in Tin Hau Food Square is the high rents. As a tourist spot, it promotes Hong Kong‚Äôs characteristic street foods. This provides numerous opportunities in the business market, and it attracts business partners to consider opening other businesses such as international hotels and chain shops. This competition provided by large enterprises pushes the rent to a level that many local stores cannot afford. A local food store owner believes that the development project of Tin Hau Food Square has not helped them at all, instead creating higher rents, and more difficulties. As a result, independent food stores that represent local and characteristic culture are encountering more obstacles while the theme of street food market is fading away. Tight regulation Another challenge for the Food Square is the strict regulation of the local shops. Some are victims of insufficient land supply, a deep-rooted problem affecting development. Due to the shops' small area, shop owners have attempted to expand their business onto public space. However, this is often stopped by the patrolling of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department. The shops do not want to face prosecution for unauthorized extension of their business' area by the department, which has a fixed penalty of $3000 to $6000, roughly three day's turnover for these shops. Transport Transport to the Tin Hau Food square is convenient as it is near Victoria Park, just a few meters away from the busy Causeway Bay district. Visitors can arrive by MTR, getting off at either Tin Hau station or Fortress Hill station, or ride buses or even minibuses.

This generally encompasses the Soviet Union and the countries of the Warsaw Pact. When Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov expressed concern that the Yalta Agreement's wording might impede Stalin's plans in Central Europe, Stalin responded \\"Never mind. We'll do it our own way later.\\" After Soviet forces remained in Eastern and Central European countries, with the beginnings of Communist puppet regimes installed in those countries, by falsified elections, Churchill referred to the region as being behind an \\"Iron Curtain\\" of control from Moscow.Muller, James W., Churchill's \\"Iron Curtain\\" Speech Fifty Years Later, University of Missouri Press, 1999, , pages 1‚Äì8 Initial control process The initial problem in countries occupied by the Red Army in 1944‚Äì45 was how to transform occupation power into control of domestic development. Because Communists were small minorities in all countries but Czechoslovakia, they were initially instructed to form coalitions in their respective countries. Soviet takeover of control at the outset generally followed a process: * a general coalition of left- wing, Anti-fascist forces; * a reorganised 'coalition' in which the Communists would have the upper hand and neutralise those in other parties who were not willing to accept their supremacy; * complete Communist domination. It was only in the Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia that former partisans entered their new government independently of Soviet influence. It was the latter's publicly stubborn independent political stances, its insistence on specifically not being a puppet regime, that led to the Tito‚ÄìStalin split and the other moves towards a \\"Titoism\\" that quickly made SR Yugoslavia unique within the context of overall Eastern Bloc politics. Property relocation By the end of World War II, most of Eastern Europe, and the Soviet Union in particular, suffered vast destruction. The Soviet Union had suffered a staggering 27 million deaths, and the destruction of significant industry and infrastructure, both by the Nazi Wehrmacht and the Soviet Union itself in a \\"scorched earth\\" policy to keep it from falling in Nazi hands as they advanced over to within of Moscow. Thereafter, the Soviet Union physically transported and relocated east European industrial assets to the Soviet Union. This was especially pronounced in eastern European Axis countries, such as Romania and Hungary, where such a policy was considered as punitive reparations (a principle accepted by Western powers). In some cases, Red Army officers viewed cities, villages and farms as being open to looting.Beevor, Antony, Berlin: The Downfall 1945, Penguin Books, 2002, . Specific reports also include Report of the Swiss legation in Budapest of 1945 and Hubertus Knabe: Tag der Befreiung? Das Kriegsende in Ostdeutschland (A day of liberation? The end of war in East Germany), Propyl√§en 2005, German. Other Eastern Bloc states were required to provide coal, industrial equipment, technology, rolling stock and other resources to reconstruct the Soviet Union. Between 1945 and 1953, the Soviets received a net transfer of resources from the rest of the Eastern Bloc under this policy roughly comparable to the net transfer from the United States to western Europe in the Marshall Plan. East Germany The red area of Germany (above) is Soviet controlled East Germany. The Soviets ceded the portion to the east of the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line (light beige) to Poland, while a portion of the isolated easternmost section of German East Prussia, the Kaliningrad Oblast, was annexed directly into the USSR Most of Germany east of the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line, which contained much of Germany's fertile land, was transferred to what remained of unilaterally Soviet-controlled Poland. At the end of World War II, political opposition immediately materialised after occupying Soviet army personnel conducted systematic pillaging and rapes in their zone of then divided Germany, with total rape victim estimates ranging from tens of thousands to two million.Schissler, Hanna The Miracle Years: A Cultural History of West Germany, 1949‚Äì1968When members of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) reported to Stalin that looting and rapes by Soviet soldiers could result in negative consequences for the future of socialism in post-war East Germany, Stalin reacted angrily: \\"I shall not tolerate anybody dragging the honor of the Red Army through the mud.\\" (Wolfgang Leonhard, Child of the Revolution ,Pathfinder Press, 1979, Norman M. Naimark. The Russians in Germany: A History of the Soviet Zone of Occupation, 1945‚Äì1949. Harvard University Press, 1995. ) Accordingly, all evidence of looting, rapes and destruction by the Red Army was deleted from archives in the Soviet occupation zone.(Wolfgang Leonhard, Child of the Revolution, Pathfinder Press, 1979, .) Factories, equipment, technicians, managers and skilled personnel were forcibly transferred to the Soviet Union. In the non-annexed remaining portion of Soviet-controlled East Germany, like in the rest of Soviet-controlled Eastern Europe, the major task of the ruling regime was to channel Soviet orders down to both the administrative apparatus and the other bloc parties pretending that these were initiatives of its own. The SED won a first narrow election victory in Soviet-zone elections in 1946, even though Soviet authorities oppressed political opponents and prevented many competing parties from participating in rural areas. Property and industry were nationalised under their government.The political process contrasted with that in western German zones occupied by Britain, France and the United States, where minister-presidents were chosen by freely elected parliamentary assemblies. (Turner, Henry Ashby The Two Germanies Since 1945: East and West, Yale University Press, 1987, , page 20) If statements or decisions deviated from the prescribed line, reprimands and, for persons outside public attention, punishment would ensue, such as imprisonment, torture and even death. Indoctrination of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism became a compulsory part of school curricula, sending professors and students fleeing to the west. Applicants for positions in the government, the judiciary and school systems had to pass ideological scrutiny. An elaborate political police apparatus kept the population under close surveillance, including Soviet SMERSH secret police. A tight system of censorship restricted access to print or the airwaves. What remained of SED opposition parties were also infiltrated to exploit their relations with their \\"bourgeois\\" counterparts in western zones to support Soviet unity along Soviet lines, while a \\"National Democratic\\" party (NDPD) was created to attract former Nazis and professional military personnel in order to rally them behind the SED. In early 1948, during the Tito‚ÄìStalin split, the SED underwent a transformation into an authoritarian party dominated by functionaries subservient to Moscow. Important decisions had to be cleared with the CPSU Central Committee apparatus or even with Stalin himself. By early 1949, the SED was capped by a Soviet-style Politburo that was effectively a small self-selecting inner circle. The German Democratic Republic was declared on 7 October 1949, within which the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs accorded the East German state administrative authority, but not autonomy, with an unlimited Soviet exercise of the occupation regime and Soviet penetration of administrative, military and secret police structures.In a congratulatory telegram, Stalin emphasised that, with the creation of East Germany, the \\"enslavement of European countries by the global imperialists was rendered impossible.\\" (Wettig, Gerhard, Stalin and the Cold War in Europe, Rowman && Littlefield, 2008, , page 179) Poland Eastern Poland (grey) was annexed directly into the USSR, while most of Germany east of the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line (pink) was ceded to what remained of Poland (white), both of which would constitute the newly created People's Republic of Poland After the Soviet invasion of German-occupied Poland in July 1944, Polish government-in-exile prime minister Stanis≈Çaw Miko≈Çajczyk flew to Moscow with Churchill to argue against the annexation of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact portion of eastern Poland by the Soviet Union. Poland served as the first real test of the American President Roosevelt's Soviet policy of \\"giving\\" to Stalin assuming noblesse oblige, with Roosevelt telling Miko≈Çajczyk before the visit, \\"Don't worry. Stalin doesn't intend to take freedom from you\\" and after assuring U.S. backing, concluding \\"I shall see to it that your country does not come out of this war injured.\\" Miko≈Çajczyk offered a smaller section of land, but Stalin declined, telling him that he would allow the exiled government to participate in the Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN and later \\"Lublin Committee\\"), which consisted of Communists and satellite parties set up under the direct control by the Soviet plenipotentiary Colonel-General Nikolai Bulganin. An agreement was reached at the Yalta Conference permitting the annexation of most of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact portion of Eastern Poland, while granting Poland part of East Germany in return. Thereafter, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic were expanded to include eastern Poland.Cohen, Saul Bernard, Geopolitics: The Geography of International Relations, Rowman & Littlefield, 2008, , page 211 The Soviet Union then compensated what remained of Poland by ceding to it the portion of Germany east of the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line, which contained much of Germany's fertile land. An agreement was reached at Yalta that the Soviets' Provisional Government made up of PKWN members would be re- organised \\"on a broad democratic basis\\" including the exiled government, and that the re-organised government's primary task would be to prepare for elections.11 February 1945 Potsdam Report, reprinted in Potsdam Ashley, John, Soames Grenville and Bernard Wasserstein, The Major International Treaties of the Twentieth Century: A History and Guide with Texts, Taylor & Francis, 2001 Pretending that it was an indigenous body representing Polish society, the PKWN took the role of a governmental authority and challenged the pre‚ÄìWorld War II Polish government-in-exile in London. Doubts began to arise whether the \\"free and unfettered elections\\" promised at the Yalta Conference would occur. Non-Stalinists and partisans, including those that fought the Nazis, were systematically persecuted. Hopes for a new free start were immediately dampened when the PKWN claimed they were entitled to choose who they wanted to take part in the government, and the Soviet NKVD seized sixteen Polish underground leaders who had wanted to participate in negotiations on the re- organisation in March 1945 brought them to the Soviet Union for a show trial in June. A propaganda photo of a citizen reading the PKWN Manifesto, issued on 22 July 1944 Poland in the 1950s and 1980s. While underground leaders were sentenced to long prison terms, assurances that political prisoners would be released and that Soviet forces and security would leave failed to be supported by concrete safeguards or implementation plans. Polish government- in-exile figures, including Stanis≈Çaw Miko≈Çajczyk then returned to a popular reception, and were able to lure several parties to their cause, effectively undermining Bloc politics. When the Miko≈Çajczyk's People's Party (PPP) continued to resist pressure to renounce a ticket of its own outside the party bloc, it was exposed to open terror, including the disqualification of PPP candidates in one quarter of the districts and the arrest of over 1000,000 PPP activists, followed by vote rigging that resulted in Gomu≈Çka's candidates winning a majority in the carefully controlled poll.Tom Buchanan, Europe's Troubled Peace, 1945‚Äì2000: 1945‚Äì2000, Blackwell Publishing, 2005, , Google Print, p.84A brief history of Poland: Chapter 13: The Post-War Years, 1945‚Äì1990 .

Resistance fighters continued to battle Soviet forces in the Ukrainian annexed portions of eastern Poland, the Soviet response to which included the arrest of as many as 600,000 people between 1944 and 1952, with about one third executed and the rest imprisoned or exiled.William Taubman.

Cambridge: Belknap, 1995, , pages 70‚Äì71 After the Red Army set up police organs to persecute class enemies, the Soviets assumed that the impoverished Hungarian populace would support Communists in coming elections. The Communists were trounced, receiving only 17% of the vote, resulting in a coalition government under Prime Minister Zolt√°n Tildy.Norton, Donald H. (2002). Essentials of European History: 1935 to the Present, p. 47. REA: Piscataway, New Jersey. . Soviet intervention, however, resulted in a government that disregarded Tildy, placed Communists in important ministries, and imposed restrictive and repressive measures, including banning the victorious Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party. Stalin's authoritarian regime repeatedly wrestled small concessions from opponents in a process named \\"salami tactics\\".

On 8 September 1944, the Red Army crossed the border and created the conditions for the coup d'√©tat the following night. The government was taken over by the \\"Fatherland Front\\" where the Communists played a leading role and an armistice followed. The Soviet military commander in Sofia assumed supreme authority, and the Communists and their allies in the Fatherland Front whom he instructed, including Kimon Georgiev, took full control of domestic politics. An armed resistance guerilla movement, known as the Goryani Movement, began immediately after Soviet occupation in 1944 and lasted until the late 1950s. It is known to be the longest as well as the first anti-Soviet armed resistance in the Eastern Bloc. The movement eventually subsided following the quelling of the 1956 uprising in Budapest, which lead to the realisation that no help would come from Western powers. On 8 September 1946, a national plebiscite was organised in which 96% of all votes (91% of the population voted) for the abolition of the monarchy and the installation of a republic.–ü—Ä–æ–≤–µ–∂–¥–∞ —Å–µ —Ä–µ—Ñ–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–¥—É–º –∑–∞ –º–æ–Ω–∞—Ä—Ö–∏—è –∏–ª–∏ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–∞ —Ä–µ–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∞, bg- history.info In October 1946 elections, persecution against opposition parties occurred, such as jailing members of the previous government, periodic newspaper publication bans and subjecting opposition followers to frequent attacks by Communist armed groups. Thereafter, the People's Republic of Bulgaria was formed and Vasil Kolarov was appointed by the Parliament as a President (Chairman) of the Republic though in fact Georgi Dimitrov, who took the post of a prime-minister, became the first man in power of the newly formed republic. The nine-year-old king Simeon II of Sax-Cobourg-Gotta was sent to exile accompanied by his mother the Queen Jovana of Savoy and his sister princess Maria-Louisa. On 6 June 1947, parliamentary leader Nikola Petkov, a critic of Soviet rule, was arrested in the Parliament building, subjected to a show trial, found guilty of espionage, sentenced to death,Crampton, R. J. A Concise History of Bulgaria, p.186. Cambridge University Press (2005), and hanged on 23 September 1947. The Bulgarian secret police arranged for the publication of a false Petkov confession. The confession's false nature was so obvious that it became an embarrassment and the authorities ceased mentioning it.Judt, Tony Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945, p. 175. Penguin Press (2005), Czechoslovakia Easternmost Czechoslovakia, Carpathian Ruthenia (light green) was annexed directly into the USSR, while the rest of the country would become the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic In 1943, Czechoslovakian leader in exile Edvard Bene≈° agreed to Stalin's demands for unconditional agreement with Soviet foreign policy, including the expulsion of over one million Sudeten ethnic Germans identified as \\"rich people\\" and ethnic Hungarians, directed by the Bene≈° decrees. Bene≈° promised Stalin a \\"close postwar collaboration\\" in military and economic affairs, including confiscation and nationalisation of large landowners' property, factories, mines, steelworks and banks under a Czechoslovakian \\"national road to socialism\\". While Bene≈° was not a Moscow cadre and several domestic reforms of other Eastern Bloc countries were not part Bene≈°' plan, Stalin did not object because the plan included property expropriation and he was satisfied with the relative strength of Communists in Czechoslovakia compared to other Eastern Bloc countries. Bene≈° traveled to Moscow in March 1945. After answering a list of questions by the Soviet NKVD, Bene≈° pleased Moscow with his plans to deport two million ethnic Sudeten Germans and 400,000 to 600,000 Hungarians, and to build a strong army that would closely coordinate with the Red Army. In April 1945, the Third Republic, a national front coalition ruled by three socialist parties, was formed. Because of the USSR's strength (they held 114 of 300 seats) and Bene≈°' loyalty, unlike in other Eastern Bloc countries, the Kremlin did not require Bloc politics or \\"reliable\\" cadres in Czechoslovakian power positions, and the executive and legislative branches retained their traditional structures. However, the Soviet Union was, at first, disappointed that their party did not take advantage of their position after receiving the most votes in 1946 elections. While they had deprived the traditional administration of major functions by transferring local and regional government to newly established committees in which they largely dominated, they failed to eliminate \\"bourgeois\\" influence in the army or to expropriate industrialists and large landowners. The existence of a somewhat independent political structure and Czechoslovakia's initial absence of stereotypical Eastern Bloc political and socioeconomic systems began to be seen as problematic by Soviet authorities. While parties outside the \\"National Front\\" were excluded from the government, they were still allowed to exist. In contrast to countries occupied by the Red Army, there were no Soviet occupation authorities in Czechoslovakia upon whom the USSR could rely to assert a leading role. Hope in Moscow was waning for a victory in the upcoming 1948 elections. A May 1947 Kremlin report concluded that \\"reactionary elements\\" praising western democracy had strengthened. Following Czechoslovakia's brief consideration of taking Marshall Plan funds, and the subsequent scolding of their parties by the Cominform at Szklarska Porƒôba in September 1947, Rudolf Sl√°nsk√Ω returned to Prague with a plan for the final seizure of power, including the StB's elimination of party enemies and purging of dissidents.

The dark green area comprises what remained as the People's Republic of Romania. In the late 1940s a number of islands in the Danube Delta and Snake Island were annexed by the Soviet Union into the Ukrainian SSR As the Red Army battled the Wehrmacht and Romanian forces in August 1944, Soviet agent Emil BodnƒÉra»ô organised an underground coalition to stage a coup d'√©tat that would put Communists‚Äîwho were then two tiny groups‚Äîinto power. However, King Michael had already organised a coup, in which BodnƒÉra≈ü also had participated, putting Michael in power. After Soviet invasions following two years of Romania fighting with the Axis, at the February 1945 Yalta Conference and the July 1945 Potsdam Conference, the western allies agreed to the Soviet absorption of the areas. Michael accepted the Soviets' armistice terms, which included military occupation along with the annexation of Northern Romania.

The Yalta Conference also had granted the Soviet Union a predominant interest in what remained of Romania, which coincided with the Soviet occupation of Romania. The Soviets organised the National Democratic Front, which was composed of several parties including the Ploughmen's Front. It became increasingly Soviet dominated. In February 1945, Soviet proponents provoked a crisis to exploit support by the Soviet occupation power for enforcement of unlimited control. In March 1945, Stalin aide Andre Vyshinskii traveled to Bucharest and installed a government that included only members subservient to the National Front. This included Ploughmen's Front member Dr. Petru Groza, who became prime minister. Groza installed a government that included many parties, though Communists held the key ministries. The potential of army resistance was neutralised by the removal of major troop leaders and the inclusion of two divisions staffed with ideologically trained prisoners of war. BodnƒÉra≈ü was appointed General Secretary and initiated re- organisation of the general police and secret police. Emil BodnƒÉra»ô Over western allies' objections, traditional parties were excluded from government and subjected to intensifying persecution. Political persecution of local leaders and strict radio and press control were designed to prepare for an eventual unlimited Communist totalitarianism, including the liquidation of opposition. When King Michael attempted to force Groza's resignation by refusing to sign any legislation (\\"the royal strike\\"), Groza enacted laws without Michael's signature. In early 1947, BodnƒÉra≈ü reported that Romanian leaders Gheorghiu-Dej and Maurer were seeking to bolster the Romanian economy by developing relations with Britain and the United States and were complaining about Soviet occupying troops. Thereafter, the PCR eliminated the role of the centrist parties, including a show trial of National Peasants' Party leaders, and forced other parties to merge with the PCR. By 1947, most non-Communist politicians were either executed, in exile or in prison. In December, Groza and Gheorghiu-Dej forced Michael to abdicate at gunpoint, and hours later the Communist-dominated legislature proclaimed Romania a \\"People's Republic.\\" Following Gheorghiu-Dej's death in 1965, Nicolae Ceau»ôescu became General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party. He changed the name of the country to the Socialist Republic of Romania, and ruled one of the most (by some accounts, the most) brutal states in the Eastern bloc for nearly 25 years. Albania On 29 December 1944, the National Liberation Movement drove the German occupiers out of Tirana. The LNC, as it was popularly called, was dominated by the two-year-old Albanian Communist Party, led by Enver Hoxha. From this day onward, unlike the other countries in what became the Eastern Bloc, Albania was an out-and-out Communist dictatorship. The LNC wasted little time eliminating almost all potential opposition and isolating the country from the non-Communist world. It swiftly took control of the police, the court system and the economy, while eliminating several hundred political opponents through a series of show trials conducted by judges without legal training. In December 1945, elections for the Albanian People's Assembly were held. However, voters only had the choice of approving or rejecting a single list from the Democratic Front (Albania), the successor to the LNC. In 1946, Albania was declared the People's Republic of Albania and, thereafter, it broke relations with the United States and refused to participate in the 1947 Marshall Plan. Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito Yugoslavia, the second-largest of the post-war countries, and the sole Communist state with open access to the Mediterranean, was only aligned with the Soviet Union for 3 post-war years (1945-1948). Its leader, Josip Broz Tito, broke with the Soviets with the Tito‚ÄìStalin split of 1948. The country subsequently came under threat of invasion by the Warsaw Pact, with the Yugoslav People's Army planning defenses against both Eastern and Western Bloc attacks. Throughout the Cold War period, the country steered an independent course, founding the Non-Aligned Movement in collaboration with Ghana, Egypt and India. At the end of World War II, Yugoslavia was considered a victor power and had neither an occupation force nor an allied control commission. Communism was considered a popular alternative to the west, in part because of the popularity of the Yugoslav Partisans during World War II and opposition to former royalist Chetnik leader Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá and King Peter. A cabinet for the new Democratic Federal Yugoslavia was formed, with 25 of the 28 members being former Communist Yugoslav Partisans led by Josip Broz Tito. The League of Communists of Yugoslavia formed the National Front of Yugoslavia coalition, with opposition members boycotting the first election because it presented only a single government list which could be accepted or rejected, without opponents. Censorship, denial of publication allocations and open intimidation of opposition groups followed. Three weeks after the election, the Front declared that a new Republic would be formed, with a new constitution put in place two months later in January 1946 initiating the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. The Communists continued a campaign against enemies, including arresting Mihailoviƒá, conducting a controversial trial and then executing him, followed by several other opposition arrests and trials. Thereafter, a pro- Soviet phase continued until the Tito‚ÄìStalin split of 1948 and the subsequent formation of the Non-Aligned Movement.

Gameplay The game showcases how a ten-year-old girl named Rae, who has lost her sight due to an accident with fireworks, interacts with the world around her. The world initially appears to be all white, but certain objects are highlighted when Rae touches them. Sound is an important element of the game, giving the player an idea of where certain objects are located. Challenges include deciding if the sound of cars is distant enough to safely cross the road. Beyond Eyes fits into a genre of walking simulator games that tell a story, and much like a blind person must memorise their environment, the game tries to show how sound memory for a blind person feels.

It is distinguished by its relatively large leaves, prominent oil glands and unusual bracts covering the flower buds before they open. Description Melaleuca conothamnoides is a woody, branching shrub about high and wide. Its leaves are arranged alternately, are lance-shaped to oblong or elliptic in shape, mostly long and wide, usually with prominent oil glands and 3 to 5 parallel veins. The flowers are arranged in heads or short spikes, mostly at the ends of the branches which continue to grow after flowering but sometimes also in the upper leaf axils. The heads contain 8 to 15 groups of flowers in threes and are up to in diameter. The flower buds are covered with overlapping greenish-black bracts. The petals are long and fall off as the flowers open. The stamens are in five bundles around the edge of the flower, each bundle containing 7 to 9 purple or pinkish-mauve stamens. The main flowering season is from September to November but has been recorded as early as August and as late as January. After flowering, the fruit develop as roughly spherical or oval groups of woody capsules. Tammin M. conothamnoides bark Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1964 by Charles Austin Gardner in the Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia from a specimen he collected himself about west of Tammin on a sandy, gravelly plain. The specific epithet (conothamnoides) refers to the similarity of this species to one in the genus Conothamnus. The ending -oides is a Latin suffix meaning \\"resembling\\" or \\"having the form of\\". Distribution and habitat This melaleuca is mainly found in sandy and gravelly soils in the drier wheatbelt between Tammin and Morawa in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest, Murchison and Yalgoo biogeographic regions. Conservation status Melaleuca conothamoides is listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Retrieved 18 March 2015. Early life, education, and training Sandra Sue Noll was born in Shawnee, Oklahoma, and raised in Fayetteville, Arkansas, where her parents moved when she was five years old. She began her theatrical training at an early age in classes for ballet, tap dancing, and drama at the Sue Keller Studio. Her ballet teachers there included Keller's daughter, Toby Keller Jorgensen, as well as a changing roster of dancers trained in Balanchine technique at the School of American Ballet in New York City. Noll continued her training at the Keller Studio until her sophomore year at the University of Arkansas. She was befriended during her college years by Eleanor King, a pioneer of modern dance who was an artist in residence at the university. In 1956, encouraged by King and at her mother's urging, she found the courage to audition for entrance to the recently established Dance Division at the Juilliard School in New York, which offered an innovative curriculum that included both ballet and modern dance for all its students.Sandra Noll Hammond, Professor of Dance, curriculum vitae supplement, dated 19 March 2015, in faculty files of the University of Hawai'i Manoa; used by permission of the subject. At Juilliard from 1956 to 1958, Noll was strongly influenced by the example of Martha Hill, modern dancer and founding director of the Dance Division. Among her modern dance teachers there were Jos√© Lim√≥n, whose company she had admired at a university performance in Arkansas, and Betty Jones, a legendary teacher and founding member of Lim√≥n's company. Her ballet teachers on the faculty, including Antony Tudor, Margaret Craske, and Alfredo Corvino, were even more important to her training. In 1957, at age twenty-one, Noll married Philip Hammond, a sociologist of religion, and acquired the surname by which she would become professionally known. She then continued her dance studies with Thalia Mara and Arthur Mahoney at the School of Ballet Repertory and with Tudor and Craske at the Metropolitan Opera Ballet School. Professional career In New York City, Hammond performed with the William Hug Dance Company (1956-1959) and with the Ballet Repertory Dancers (1958-1960), directed by Mara and Mahoney. Following her husband's academic appointments, she then began moving about the country. She danced as a soloist and guest artist with the Connecticut Opera Company (1961-1964) and, in San Francisco, as a corps member of the Pacific Ballet (1964-1965), directed by Alan Howard. After a career hiatus of a few years, she moved to Tucson, Arizona, in 1971. There, she joined the Arizona Dance Theater, a touring company directed by Frances Smith Cohen, and remained with that group until 1978. Over the next two decades, she performed as a free- lance artist, specializing in Baroque dance, early Romantic ballet, and other styles of historical dance. As a Baroque dance specialist, she performed nationally with early music ensembles and with historical dance pioneers R√©gine Astier and Angene Feves.\\"Sandra Noll Hammond,\\" biography, CORPS de Ballet International.

Back in Tucson, as departmental director of dance, she also created choreography for student and faculty concerts, in which she sometimes performed, and she continued her ballet studies with Dolores Mitrovich, whose career in Italy had include ballet training with Rafael Grassi and Enrico Cecchetti. Thereafter, having moved to California in 1979, Hammond was a visiting lecturer at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where she taught dance history and ballet technique and earned a bachelor of arts degree in liberal studies. Later, as visiting lecturer at the University of California, Los Angeles, she taught dance history, Baroque dance technique, and early nineteenth-century ballet technique and was the leader of a ballet history research seminar at the graduate level.Marian Smith, Ballet and Opera in the Age of \\"Giselle\\" (Princeton University Press, 2000), p. 244. In 1985, she moved again, to Hawai'i, where she won appointments as associate professor, full professor, and director of dance at the University of Hawai'i Manoa, in Honolulu.

In California, besides appearances in Santa Barbara and Los Angeles, she was a featured presenter and performer at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, Stanford University, the California State University at Long Beach, and Mills College in Oakland. An accomplished actress as well as a dancer, she sometimes recreated historical dance performances with narration by her Santa Barbara colleague Frank W.D. Ries. Her impersonation of Anna Pavlova in Pavlova Gavotte (1913), performed to Paul Lincke's song \\"Das Gl≈≠hw≈´rmchen\\" (The Glow-Worm) in authentic costume, was an audience favorite.

Description  Shizocera (Hymenoptera: Argidae), the Mo sawfly, commonly called ‚ÄòS√¢u ƒÉn l√° M·ª°‚Äô ('Mo-leaf-eating-caterpillar') or 'S√¢u Ong' ('bee-like caterpillar') by the local people, has been noticed in pure stands of 'Mo' trees (Manglietia conifera) in northern regions of Vietnam since 1966. The insect (larva) feeds on leaves and is also found in natural forest where the tree is scattered. Because the host tree and its pest have a limited distribution, the literature on the pest has been very limited and mostly confined to the local language. Mo sawfly was first reported from the results obtained in a study carried out by the Forest Research Institute of Vietnam from 1971‚Äì76, in an experimental forest station in Vinh Phuc Province.Nguyen Trung Tin (Ministry of Forestry, Hanoi (Viet Nam). Forest Research Inst., 1990) Biology of the sawfly Shizocera sp. (Hymenoptera: Argidae), in Northern Vietnam  Life history  The Mo sawfly deposits eggs under the epidermis of the leaf, in two rows on either side of the midrib. The incubation period depends on the temperature ‚Äì it may range from 3 days at 28 ¬∞C to 26 days at 16 ¬∞C. As the eggs develop, they increase in size, as do the eggs of other sawflies, by absorbing water from the leaf. The larvae pass through five instars in the male and six in the female. The larval period ranges from about 17 days at 24 ¬∞C to 32 days at 19 ¬∞C. The mature larva falls down and creeps into the ground to make a cocoon. As in other sawflies, three developmental stages are passed within the cocoon ‚Äì eonymph, pronymph and pupa. The duration of the eonymph stage is short, pronymph stage is 13‚Äì15 days and pupa, 8 days at 27 ¬∞C to 15 days at 18 ¬∞C. The life cycle is completed in 59‚Äì65 days at 22‚Äì24 ¬∞C and 85‚Äì86% RH. The Mo sawfly appears to prefer a temperate climate of 21‚Äì24 ¬∞C, monthly precipitation of 50‚Äì150mm and RH of 85‚Äì88%. Under some combinations of climatic factors, the Mo sawfly enters diapause and/or aestivation (see below).  Host distribution  Until recent years, M. conifera was the only known host of this sawfly and its distribution was coincident with that of the host tree (i.e. Vietnam and southern China). The pest has now attacked other species of the genus, especially M. phuthoensis Dandy varietyManglietia phuthoensis Dandy M·ª† PH√ö TH·ªå (Manglietia phuthoensis Dandy) which are also planted as commercial crops.  Population dynamics  In northern Vietnam, emergence of the adult Mo sawfly occurs twice a year ‚Äì from spring to early summer (March to May) and from autumn to early winter (late August to early January). Emergence during autumn‚Äìwinter takes place in waves. The favourable period for the growth of the sawfly is about five months during the spring‚Äìsummer and about three months during the autumn. The insect undergoes aestivation and/or diapause under certain combinations of climatic factors which are not clearly understood. Diapause occurs in the eonymph stage. Prolonged diapause in cocoons may sometimes continue through the winter, spring and summer, with the adults emerging in autumn‚Äìwinter of the following year, or the diapause may continue over the summer, autumn and winter, with the adults emerging in the spring of the following year. In the active season, the Mo sawfly may have two generations ‚Äì one which takes about two months to complete and another which takes about 9‚Äì11 months. Depending on the temperature, in some places and some years there may be only one generation per year, due to diapause.  Impact  Although outbreak of the Mo sawfly causes severe damage to leaves, its quantitative impact has not been studied until recently. According to reports by the local government of Bac Kan province, the infested areas have been rising rapidly from just below 150 hectares to above 1,800 hectares between 2011 and summer of 2014. Due to abnormally warm temperatures, alarming outbreaks have also been reported by the Plant Protection Sub-Department in Lao Cai province at 6.5 hectares in damages as of late February 2015 with the density of infestation ranging from 150 and up to 600 larvae per branch. So far, manual control efforts have been difficult due to the physical height of the trees and remote geographical locations of the infestation.  Natural enemies  No information is available on natural enemies.  Control  No effective control measures are known. There is some limited success in killing baby larvae directly with broad-use insecticides containing fipronil, fenitrothion, trichlorfon or nereistoxin analogues such as cartap and bensultap. Other combined methods include: * hand-picking of Mo sawfly's eggs and baby larvae * hanging bright yellow sticky sheets to attract and trap the adult flies * applying cartap- or diazinon-based insecticides after plowing the ground around each tree at 6‚Äì10 cm depth and up to 100 cm in radius are also recommended by local authorities * protecting ant colonies (especially those of Oecophylla smaragdina and Crematogaster travancorensis species) * forbidding bird hunting in the infested regions  References   External links  * Country report on the forestry invasive species situation in Vanuatu * Tropical Forest Insect Pests: Ecology, Impact, and Management, by K.

Bonvicini has lived and worked in Berlin since 1986. In 2003, Bonvicini was appointed the Professor of Sculpture and Performance at the Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste in Vienna. Since 2017, she has been the Professor of Sculpture at the Universit√§t der K√ºnste Berlin.https://www.udk-berlin.de/service/presse- kommunikation/pressemitteilungen/pressemitteilungen-2017/berufung-monica- bonvicini-uebernimmt-eine-professur-fuer-bildhauerei/ In her work Bonvicini investigates the relationship between power structures, gender and space. She works intermediately with installation, sculpture, video, photography and drawing mediums. She has installed permanent artworks at the Queen Elizabeth II Olympic Park in London, the harbour at the Oslo Opera House and the Istanbul Museum of Modern Art. Bonvicini was appointed Commander of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic in 2012. Education Bonvicini studied at the Hochschule der K√ºnste in Berlin and at the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia. From 1998 to 2002 Bonvicini lived in Los Angeles and taught at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. Career Bonvicini began exhibiting her work internationally in the mid-1990s. Bonvicini describes her practice as an exploration of relationships between architecture and space, power, gender, sexuality, space, surveillance and control. Her works aim to question and investigate the meaning of making art alongside the flexible nature of language and primarily the idea of freedom and the limits and opportunities that are associated with the word. Her works have been featured in several biennales, such as the Berlin Biennale (1998, 2003 and 2014), the Istanbul Biennial (2003 and 2017), and the Venice Biennale (1999, 2005, 2011 and 2015), are included in numerous public collections, and had solo presentations in renown institutions worldwide. Though known for her work as an installation artist, Bonvicini is also recognized for her photographic and video work.  Awards (selection)  Bonvicini won the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale in 1999, the National Gallery Prize for Young Art in Berlin in 2005, the Rolandpreis f√ºr Kunst in Bremen in 2013, and the Oskar Kokoschka Prize in Vienna in 2020.  Work Bonvicini works with a variety of materials, not limited to, drywall, steel, polyurethane, metal, chains, wood, spray paint, aluminium, ink, tempera, concrete, and glass. The artworks often employ language and text, humour and irony. Some of her pieces are courageously explicit, thus pushing and undermining institutional boundaries and questioning the role of spectator. Bonvicini is also commonly described as working site-specifically, creating discursive displays that relate to an exhibiting venue and its operational context. Bonvicini critically explores the legacy of modernism as both an artistic and a social period. She also frequently references minimalism, conceptual art, Institutional Critique, as well as feminist and queer subcultures and civil rights‚Äô and other political movements. I Believe the Skin of Things as in That of Women, 1999  This work, entitled I Believe the Skin of Things as in That of Women, was created in 1998 by Bonvicini for a gallery exhibition in Vienna. Harald Szeemann saw the work and invited Bonvicini to take a part in the upcoming Venice Biennale, where it was awarded the Golden Lion next year. The work examines gender relations, manifested in the field of architecture and construction. Bonvicini describes the work as a confrontation with the ‚Äúboys club‚Äù attitude that often encompasses the world of architecture. The installation is an architectural space, constructed from drywall panels. Quotes from famous male architects, including Auguste Perret and Adolf Loos, are written in a graffiti-like style. The title of the work is the famous quote by Le Corbusier. The quotes are intertwined with cartoon-styled compositions of naked men performing a variety of sexual acts as they gaze upon women. Some of these drawings refer to the photographs of early modernist architecture that were supposed to depict and establish a canon of a new, modern domestic dwelling. The work is an example of Bonvicini‚Äôs dry-humour and fearless content that is seen in many of her other works.  She Lies, 2010  A permanent installation She Lies was publicly revealed on May 11, 2010. The work, commissioned by Public Art Norway, floats in Oslofjord in front of the Oslo Opera House. The work is made of styrofoam, stainless steel, reflecting glass panels, and glass splinters and stands on a concrete pontoon that is equipped with an anchoring system. The monumental sculpture (12 x 17 x 16 meters in size) is an interpretation of Caspar David Friedrich‚Äôs 1824 painting Das Eismeer. Bonvicini reuses the imagery of the ice masses seen in Friedrich‚Äôs painting as a symbolic reference to romanticism and its ideals that established different common and fixed clich√©s, such as of art and art professionalism, but also of nature and scientific exploration. Reacting to the changing tides, the installation turns around its axis and moves within a range of 50 meters. The mirrors and transparent pieces provide constantly changing reflections. Bonvicini describes the work as ‚ÄúA monument to a state of permanent change.‚Äù  RUN, 2012  RUN is a permanent installation at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London that was installed for the 2012 Summer Olympics. The work‚Äôs composition and title were inspired by the lyrics and language in popular music. The work pays reference to specific songs, including The Velvet Underground‚Äôs ‚ÄúRun, Run, Run‚Äù, Neil Young‚Äôs ‚ÄúRunning Dry‚Äù and Bruce Springsteen‚Äôs ‚ÄúBorn to Run‚Äù. Constructed from steel and reflective glass, the three installed characters are nine meters tall and each piece weighs ten tons. Bonvicini‚Äôs work stands in the plaza of the Copper Box Arena, and is the largest installation in the park. Bonvicini uses the reflective nature of glass again to mirror the installation's changing environment throughout the day. At night, installed LED lights work to cause a glowing effect that is spread throughout the work by the reflective surfaces that are throughout the letters. The references to music, alternative and popular cultures were chosen in response to the processes of gentrification and changing urban scenery that London has witnessed in preparation for the Olympic Games.  Video works  Besides sculptural and two-dimensional works, Bonvicini also created numerous videos and multimedia installations. These artworks follow the topics common to her practice, interrogating politics of body, gender, space, architecture and art institutions. Sometimes they stem from performances, like her video work ‚ÄúNo Head Man,‚Äù which originated in the performance conceived for the 27th S√£o Paulo Art Biennial. The works of moving image are often minimalistic, drawing on references to the history of European Nouvelle Vague / Auteur cinema and avant-garde video artists, like Jack Goldstein. The video art of Bonvicini is included in renowned collections worldwide, Julia Stoschek collection, Sammlung Hoffmann, FRAC Lorraine and Castello di Rivoli to mention few.  Hurricanes and Other Catastrophes (2006-ongoing)  In 2006, Bonvicini commenced her black and white painting series, dedicated to the topics of natural disasters, and their ensuing architectural debris and social catastrophes.

The theorem can be considered a vast generalisation of the Narasimhan‚ÄìSeshadri theorem which defines a correspondence between stable vector bundles and unitary representations of the fundamental group of a compact Riemann surface. In fact the Narasimhan‚ÄìSeshadri theorem may be obtained as a special case of the nonabelian Hodge correspondence by setting the Higgs field to zero.  History  It was proven by M. S. Narasimhan and C. S. Seshadri in 1965 that stable vector bundles on a compact Riemann surface correspond to irreducible projective unitary representations of the fundamental group. This theorem was phrased in a new light in the work of Simon Donaldson in 1983, who showed that stable vector bundles correspond to Yang‚ÄìMills connections, whose holonomy gives the representations of the fundamental group of Narasimhan and Seshadri. The Narasimhan‚ÄìSeshadri theorem was generalised from the case of compact Riemann surfaces to the setting of compact K√§hler manifolds by Donaldson in the case of algebraic surfaces, and in general by Karen Uhlenbeck and Shing- Tung Yau. This correspondence between stable vector bundles and Hermitian Yang‚ÄìMills connections is known as the Kobayashi‚ÄìHitchin correspondence. The Narasimhan‚ÄìSeshadri theorem concerns unitary representations of the fundamental group. Nigel Hitchin introduced a notion of a Higgs bundle as an algebraic object which should correspond to complex representations of the fundamental group (in fact the terminology \\"Higgs bundle\\" was introduced by Carlos Simpson after the work of Hitchin). The first instance of the nonabelian Hodge theorem was proven by Hitchin, who considered the case of rank two Higgs bundles over a compact Riemann surface. Hitchin showed that a polystable Higgs bundle corresponds to a solution of Hitchin's equations, a system of differential equations obtained as a dimensional reduction of the Yang‚ÄìMills equations to dimension two. It was shown by Donaldson in this case that solutions to Hitchin's equations are in correspondence with representations of the fundamental group. The results of Hitchin and Donaldson for Higgs bundles of rank two on a compact Riemann surface were vastly generalised by Carlos Simpson and Kevin Corlette. The statement that polystable Higgs bundles correspond to solutions of Hitchin's equations was proven by Simpson. The correspondence between solutions of Hitchin's equations and representations of the fundamental group was shown by Corlette.  Definitions  In this section we recall the objects of interest in the nonabelian Hodge theorem.  Higgs bundles  A Higgs bundle over a compact K√§hler manifold (X,\\\\omega) is a pair (E,\\\\Phi) where E\\\\to X is a holomorphic vector bundle and \\\\Phi: E\\\\to E\\\\otimes \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Omega}^1 is an \\\\operatorname{End}(E)-valued holomorphic (1,0)-form on X, called the Higgs field. Additionally, the Higgs field must satisfy \\\\Phi\\\\wedge\\\\Phi = 0. A Higgs bundle is (semi-)stable if, for every proper, non-zero coherent subsheaf \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\subset E which is preserved by the Higgs field, so that \\\\Phi(\\\\mathcal{F})\\\\subset \\\\mathcal{F}, one has :\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{deg}(\\\\mathcal{F})}{\\\\operatorname{rank}(\\\\mathcal{F})} < \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{deg}(E)}{\\\\operatorname{rank}(E)} \\\\quad \\\\text{(resp. }\\\\le\\\\text{)}. This rational number is called the slope, denoted \\\\mu(E), and the above definition mirrors that of a stable vector bundle. A Higgs bundle is polystable if it is a direct sum of stable Higgs bundles of the same slope, and is therefore semi-stable.  Hermitian Yang‚ÄìMills connections and Hitchin's equations  The generalisation of Hitchin's equation to higher dimension can be phrased as an analog of the Hermitian Yang‚ÄìMills equations for a certain connection constructed out of the pair (E,\\\\Phi). A Hermitian metric h on a Higgs bundle (E,\\\\Phi) gives rise to a Chern connection abla_A and curvature F_A. The condition that \\\\Phi is holomorphic can be phrased as \\\\bar \\\\partial_A \\\\Phi = 0. Hitchin's equations, on a compact Riemann surface, state that :\\\\begin{cases}&F;_A + [\\\\Phi, \\\\Phi^*] = \\\\lambda \\\\operatorname{Id}_E\\\\ &\\\\bar\\\\partial_A \\\\Phi = 0 \\\\end{cases} for a constant \\\\lambda = -2\\\\pi i \\\\mu(E). In higher dimensions these equations generalise as follows. Define a connection D on E by D = abla_A + \\\\Phi + \\\\Phi^*. This connection is said to be a Hermitian Yang‚ÄìMills connection (and the metric a Hermitian Yang‚ÄìMills metric if :\\\\Lambda_{\\\\omega} F_D = \\\\lambda \\\\operatorname{Id}_E. This reduces to Hitchin's equations for a compact Riemann surface.  Representations of the fundamental group and harmonic metrics  A representation of the fundamental group \\\\rho\\\\colon \\\\pi_1(X) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{GL}(r,\\\\Complex) gives rise to a vector bundle with flat connection as follows. The universal cover \\\\hat{X} of X is a principal bundle over X with structure group \\\\pi_1(X). Thus there is an associated bundle to \\\\hat{X} given by :E=\\\\hat{X} \\\\times_{\\\\rho} \\\\Complex^r. This vector bundle comes naturally equipped with a flat connection D. If h is a Hermitian metric on E, define an operator D_h as follows. Decompose D=\\\\partial + \\\\bar \\\\partial into operators of type (1,0) and (0,1) respectively. Let A' be the unique operator of type (1,0) such that the (1,0)-connection A'+\\\\bar \\\\partial preserves the metric h. Define \\\\Phi = (\\\\partial - A')/2, and set D_h = \\\\bar \\\\partial + \\\\Phi. Define the pseudocurvature of h to be G_h = (D_h)^2. The metric h is said to be harmonic if :\\\\Lambda_{\\\\omega} G_h = 0. Notice that the condition G_h=0 is equivalent to the three conditions \\\\bar\\\\partial^2 = 0, \\\\bar\\\\partial \\\\Phi = 0, \\\\Phi \\\\wedge \\\\Phi = 0, so if G_h=0 then the pair (E,\\\\Phi) defines a Higgs bundle with holomorphic structure on E given by the Dolbeault operator \\\\bar\\\\partial. It is a result of Corlette that if h is harmonic, then it automatically satisfies G_h=0 and so gives rise to a Higgs bundle.  Moduli spaces  To each of the three concepts: Higgs bundles, flat connections, and representations of the fundamental group, one can define a moduli space. This requires a notion of isomorphism between these objects. In the following, fix a smooth complex vector bundle E. Every Higgs bundle will be considered to have the underlying smooth vector bundle E. * (Higgs bundles) The group of complex gauge transformations \\\\mathcal{G}^{\\\\Complex} acts on the set \\\\mathcal{H} of Higgs bundles by the formula g\\\\cdot (E,\\\\Phi) = (g\\\\cdot E, g\\\\Phi g^{-1}). If \\\\mathcal{H}^{ss} and \\\\mathcal{H}^s denote the subsets of semistable and stable Higgs bundles respectively, then one obtains moduli spaces ::M_{Dol}^{ss} := \\\\mathcal{H}^{ss} // \\\\mathcal{G}^{\\\\mathcal{C}},\\\\qquad M_{Dol}^{s} := \\\\mathcal{H}^s / \\\\mathcal{G}^{\\\\mathcal{C}} : where these quotients are taken in the sense of geometric invariant theory, so orbits whose closures intersect are identified in the moduli space. These moduli spaces are called the Dolbeault moduli spaces. Notice that by setting \\\\Phi = 0, one obtains as subsets the moduli spaces of semi-stable and stable holomorphic vector bundles N_{Dol}^{ss} \\\\subset M_{Dol}^{ss} and N_{Dol}^s \\\\subset M_{Dol}^s. It is also true that if one defines the moduli space M_{Dol}^{ps} of polystable Higgs bundles then this space is isomorphic to the space of semi-stable Higgs bundles, as every gauge orbit of semi-stable Higgs bundles contains in its closure a unique orbit of polystable Higgs bundles. * (Flat connections) The group complex gauge transformations also acts on the set \\\\mathcal{A} of flat connections abla on the smooth vector bundle E. Define the moduli spaces ::M_{dR} := \\\\mathcal{A}//\\\\mathcal{G}^{\\\\mathcal{C}},\\\\qquad M_{dR}^* := \\\\mathcal{A}^* / \\\\mathcal{G}^{\\\\mathcal{C}}, :where \\\\mathcal{A}^* denotes the subset consisting of irreducible flat connections abla which do not split as a direct sum abla = abla_1 \\\\oplus abla_2 on some splitting E=E_1\\\\oplus E_2 of the smooth vector bundle E. These moduli spaces are called the de Rham moduli spaces. * (Representations) The set of representations \\\\operatorname{Hom}(\\\\pi_1(X), \\\\operatorname{GL}(r, \\\\Complex)) of the fundamental group of X is acted on by the general linear group by conjugation of representations. Denote by the superscripts + and * the subsets consisting of semisimple representations and irreducible representations respectively. Then define moduli spaces ::M_{B}^+ = \\\\operatorname{Hom}^+(\\\\pi_1(X), \\\\operatorname{GL}(r, \\\\Complex)) // G,\\\\qquad M_{B}^* = \\\\operatorname{Hom}^*(\\\\pi_1(X), \\\\operatorname{GL}(r, \\\\Complex)) / G : of semisimple and irreducible representations respectively. These quotients are taken in the sense of geometric invariant theory, where two orbits are identified if their closures intersect. These moduli spaces are called the Betti moduli spaces.  Statement  The nonabelian Hodge theorem can be split into two parts. The first part was proved by Donaldson in the case of rank two Higgs bundles over a compact Riemann surface, and in general by Corlette. In general the nonabelian Hodge theorem holds for a smooth complex projective variety X, but some parts of the correspondence hold in more generality for compact K√§hler manifolds. : > Nonabelian Hodge theorem (part 1): A representation \\\\rho: \\\\pi_1(X) \\\\to > \\\\operatorname{GL}(r,\\\\Complex) of the fundamental group is semisimple if and > only if the flat vector bundle E=\\\\hat{X}\\\\times_{\\\\rho} \\\\Complex^r admits a > harmonic metric. Furthermore the representation is irreducible if and only > if the flat vector bundle is irreducible. The second part of the theorem was proven by Hitchin in the case of rank two Higgs bundles on a compact Riemann surface, and in general by Simpson. : > Nonabelian Hodge theorem (part 2): A Higgs bundle (E,\\\\Phi) has a Hermitian > Yang‚ÄìMills metric if and only if it is polystable. This metric is a harmonic > metric, and therefore arises from a semisimple representation of the > fundamental group, if and only if the Chern classes c_1(E) and c_2(E) > vanish. Furthermore, a Higgs bundle is stable if and only if it admits an > irreducible Hermitian Yang‚ÄìMills connection, and therefore comes from an > irreducible representation of the fundamental group. Combined together, the correspondence can be phrased as follows: : > Nonabelian Hodge theorem: A Higgs bundle (which is topologically trivial) > arises from a semisimple representation of the fundamental group if and only > if it is polystable. Furthermore it arises from an irreducible > representation if and only if it is stable.  In terms of moduli spaces  The nonabelian Hodge correspondence not only gives a bijection of sets, but homeomorphisms of moduli spaces. Indeed, if two Higgs bundles are isomorphic, in the sense that they can be related by a gauge transformation and therefore correspond to the same point in the Dolbeault moduli space, then the associated representations will also be isomorphic, and give the same point in the Betti moduli space. In terms of the moduli spaces the nonabelian Hodge theorem can be phrased as follows. : > Nonabelian Hodge theorem (moduli space version): There are homeomorphisms > M_{Dol}^{ss} \\\\cong M_{dR} \\\\cong M_B^+ of moduli spaces which restrict to > homeomorphisms M_{Dol}^s \\\\cong M_{dR}^* \\\\cong M_B^*. In general these moduli spaces will be not just topological spaces, but have some additional structure. For example, the Dolbeault moduli space and Betti moduli space M_{Dol}^{ss}, M_B^+ are naturally complex algebraic varieties, and where it is smooth, the de Rham moduli space M_{dR} is a Riemannian manifold. On the common locus where these moduli spaces are smooth, the map M_{dR} \\\\to M_B^+ is a diffeomorphism, and since M_B^+ is a complex manifold on the smooth locus, M_{dR} obtains a compatible Riemannian and complex structure, and is therefore a K√§hler manifold. Similarly, on the smooth locus, the map M_B^+ \\\\to M_{Dol}^{ss} is a diffeomorphism. However, even though the Dolbeault and Betti moduli spaces both have natural complex structures, these are not isomorphic. In fact, if they are denoted I,J (for the associated integrable almost complex structures) then IJ=-JI. In particular if one defines a third almost complex structure by K=IJ then I^2 =J^2 =K^2 = IJK= -\\\\operatorname{Id}. If one combines these three complex structures with the Riemannian metric coming from M_{dR}, then on the smooth locus the moduli spaces become a Hyperk√§hler manifold.  Relation to Hitchin‚ÄìKobayashi correspondence and unitary representations  If one sets the Higgs field \\\\Phi to zero, then a Higgs bundle is simply a holomorphic vector bundle. This gives an inclusion N_{Dol}^{ss} \\\\subset M_{Dol}^{ss} of the moduli space of semi-stable holomorphic vector bundles into the moduli space of Higgs bundles. The Hitchin‚ÄìKobayashi correspondence gives a correspondence between holomorphic vector bundles and Hermitian Yang‚ÄìMills connections over compact K√§hler manifolds, and can therefore be seen as a special case of the nonabelian Hodge correspondence. When the underlying vector bundle is topologically trivial, the holonomy of a Hermitian Yang‚ÄìMills connection will give rise to a unitary representation of the fundamental group, \\\\rho:\\\\pi_1(X) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{U}(r). The subset of the Betti moduli space corresponding to the unitary representations, denoted N_B^+, will get mapped isomorphically onto the moduli space of semi-stable vector bundles N_{Dol}^{ss}.  Examples   Rank one Higgs bundles on compact Riemann surfaces The special case where the rank of the underlying vector bundle is one gives rise to a simpler correspondence. Firstly, every line bundle is stable, as there are no proper non-zero subsheaves. In this case, a Higgs bundle consists of a pair (L, \\\\Phi) of a holomorphic line bundle and a holomorphic (1,0)-form, since the endomorphism of a line bundle are trivial. In particular, the Higgs field is uncoupled from the holomorphic line bundle, so the moduli space M_{Dol} will split as a product, and the one-form automatically satisfies the condition \\\\Phi\\\\wedge\\\\Phi = 0. The gauge group of a line bundle is commutative, and so acts trivially on the Higgs field \\\\Phi by conjugation. Thus the moduli space can be identified as a product :M_{Dol} = \\\\operatorname{Jac}(X) \\\\times H^0(X, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Omega}^1) of the Jacobian variety of X, classifying all holomorphic line bundles up to isomorphism, and the vector space H^0(X, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Omega}^1) of holomorphic (1,0)-forms. In the case of rank one Higgs bundles on compact Riemann surfaces, one obtains a further description of the moduli space. The fundamental group of a compact Riemann surface, a surface group, is given by :\\\\pi_1(X) = \\\\langle a_1,\\\\dots,a_g,b_1,\\\\dots,b_g \\\\mid [a_1,b_1]\\\\cdots[a_g,b_g]=e\\\\rangle where g is the genus of the Riemann surface. The representations of \\\\pi_1(X) into the general linear group \\\\operatorname{GL}(1,\\\\Complex) = \\\\Complex^* are therefore given by 2g-tuples of non-zero complex numbers: :\\\\operatorname{Hom}(\\\\pi_1(X), \\\\Complex^*) = (\\\\Complex^*)^{2g}. Since \\\\Complex^* is abelian, the conjugation on this space is trivial, and the Betti moduli space is M_B = (\\\\Complex^*)^{2g}. On the other hand, by Serre duality, the space of holomorphic (1,0)-forms is dual to the sheaf cohomology H^1(X, \\\\mathcal{O}_X). The Jacobian variety is an Abelian variety given by the quotient :\\\\operatorname{Jac}(X) = \\\\frac{H^1(X,\\\\mathcal{O}_X)}{H^1(X,\\\\Z)}, so has tangent spaces given by the vector space H^1(X,\\\\mathcal{O}_X), and cotangent bundle :T^* \\\\operatorname{Jac}(X) = \\\\operatorname{Jac}(X) \\\\times H^1(X,\\\\mathcal{O}_X)^* = \\\\operatorname{Jac}(X) \\\\times H^0(X, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Omega}^1) = M_{Dol}. That is, the Dolbeault moduli space, the moduli space of holomorphic Higgs line bundles, is simply the cotangent bundle to the Jacobian, the moduli space of holomorphic line bundles. The nonabelian Hodge correspondence therefore gives a diffeomorphism :T^* \\\\operatorname{Jac}(X) \\\\cong (\\\\Complex^*)^{2g} which is not a biholomorphism. One can check that the natural complex structures on these two spaces are different, and satisfy the relation IJ=-JI, giving a hyperk√§hler structure on the cotangent bundle to the Jacobian.  Generalizations  It is possible to define the notion of a principal G-Higgs bundle for a complex reductive algebraic group G, a version of Higgs bundles in the category of principal bundles. There is a notion of a stable principal bundle, and one can define a stable principal G-Higgs bundle. A version of the nonabelian Hodge theorem holds for these objects, relating principal G-Higgs bundles to representations of the fundamental group into G.  Nonabelian Hodge theory  The correspondence between Higgs bundles and representations of the fundamental group can be phrased as a kind of nonabelian Hodge theorem, which is to say, an analogy of the Hodge decomposition of a K√§hler manifold, but with coefficients in the nonabelian group \\\\operatorname{GL}(n,\\\\Complex) instead of the abelian group \\\\Complex. The exposition here follows the discussion by Oscar Garcia-Prada in the appendix to Wells' Differential Analysis on Complex Manifolds.  Hodge decomposition  The Hodge decomposition of a compact K√§hler manifold decomposes the complex de Rham cohomology into the finer Dolbeault cohomology: :H_{dR}^k(X,\\\\Complex) = \\\\bigoplus_{p+q=k} H_{Dol}^{p,q}(X). At degree one this gives a direct sum :H^1(X,\\\\mathbb{C}) = H^{0,1}(X)\\\\oplus H^{1,0}(X) \\\\cong H^1(X, \\\\mathcal{O}_X) \\\\oplus H^0(X, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Omega}^1) where we have applied the Dolbeault theorem to phrase the Dolbeault cohomology in terms of sheaf cohomology of the sheaf of holomorphic (1,0)-forms \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Omega}^1, and the structure sheaf \\\\mathcal{O}_X of holomorphic functions on X.  Nonabelian cohomology  When constructing sheaf cohomology, the coefficient sheaf \\\\mathcal{F} is always a sheaf of abelian groups. This is because for an abelian group, every subgroup is normal, so the quotient group :\\\\check{H}^k(X, \\\\mathcal{F}) = Z^k(X, \\\\mathcal{F})/B^k(X, \\\\mathcal{F}) of sheaf cocycles by sheaf coboundaries is always well-defined. When the sheaf \\\\mathcal{F} is not abelian, these quotients are not necessarily well-defined, and so sheaf cohomology theories do not exist, except in the following special cases: * k=0: The 0th sheaf cohomology group is always the space of global sections of the sheaf \\\\mathcal{F}, so is always well-defined even if \\\\mathcal{F} is nonabelian. * k=1: The 1st sheaf cohomology set is well-defined for a nonabelian sheaf \\\\mathcal{F}, but it is not itself a quotient group. * k=2: In some special cases, an analogue of the second degree sheaf cohomology can be defined for nonabelian sheaves using the theory of gerbes. A key example of nonabelian cohomology occurs when the coefficient sheaf is \\\\mathcal{GL}(r, \\\\Complex), the sheaf of holomorphic functions into the complex general linear group. In this case it is a well-known fact from ƒåech cohomology that the cohomology set :\\\\check{H}^1(X, \\\\mathcal{GL}(r, \\\\Complex)) is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of holomorphic vector bundles of rank r on X, up to isomorphism. Notice that there is a distinguished holomorphic vector bundle of rank r, the trivial vector bundle, so this is actually a cohomology pointed set. In the special case r=1 the general linear group is the abelian group \\\\mathbb{C}^* of non-zero complex numbers with respect to multiplication. In this case one obtains the group of holomorphic line bundles up to isomorphism, otherwise known as the Picard group.  Nonabelian Hodge theorem  The first cohomology group H^1(X,\\\\Complex) is isomorphic to the group of homomorphisms from the fundamental group \\\\pi_1(X) to \\\\Complex. This can be understood, for example, by applying the Hurewicz theorem. Thus the regular Hodge decomposition mentioned above may be phrased as :\\\\operatorname{Hom}(\\\\pi_1(X), \\\\Complex) \\\\cong H^1(X, \\\\mathcal{O}_X) \\\\oplus H^0(X, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Omega}^1). The nonabelian Hodge correspondence gives an analogy of this statement of the Hodge theorem for nonabelian cohomology, as follows. A Higgs bundle consists of a pair (E,\\\\Phi) where E is a holomorphic vector bundle, and \\\\Phi\\\\in H^0(X, \\\\operatorname{End}(E)\\\\otimes \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Omega}^1) is a holomorphic, endomorphism-valued (1,0)-form. The holomorphic vector bundle E may be identified with an element of \\\\check{H}^1(X, \\\\mathcal{GL}(r, \\\\Complex)) as mentioned above. Thus a Higgs bundle may be thought of as an element of the direct product :(E,\\\\Phi) \\\\in \\\\check{H}^1(X, \\\\mathcal{GL}(r, \\\\Complex)) \\\\oplus H^0(X, \\\\operatorname{End}(E)\\\\otimes \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Omega}^1). The nonabelian Hodge correspondence gives an isomorphism from the moduli space of \\\\operatorname{GL}(r,\\\\Complex)-representations of the fundamental group \\\\pi_1(X) to the moduli space of Higgs bundles, which could therefore be written as an isomorphism :\\\\operatorname{Rep}(\\\\pi_1(X), \\\\operatorname{GL}(r,\\\\Complex)) \\\\cong \\\\check{H}^1(X, \\\\mathcal{GL}(r, \\\\Complex)) \\\\oplus H^0(X, \\\\operatorname{End}(E)\\\\otimes \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Omega}^1). This can be seen as an analogy of the regular Hodge decomposition above. The moduli space of representations \\\\operatorname{Rep}(\\\\pi_1(X), \\\\operatorname{GL}(r,\\\\Complex)) plays the role of the first cohomology of X with nonabelian coefficients, the cohomology set \\\\check{H}^1(X, \\\\mathcal{GL}(r,\\\\Complex)) plays the role of the space H^1(X,\\\\mathcal{O}_X), and the group H^0(X, \\\\operatorname{End}(E)\\\\otimes \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Omega}^1) plays the role of the holomorphic (1,0)-forms H^0(X, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Omega}^1). The isomorphism here is written \\\\cong, but this is not an actual isomorphism of sets, as the moduli space of Higgs bundles is not literally given by the direct sum above, as this is only an analogy.  Hodge structure  The moduli space M_{Dol}^{ss} of semi-stable Higgs bundles has a natural action of the multiplicative group \\\\Complex^*, given by scaling the Higgs field: \\\\lambda \\\\cdot (E,\\\\Phi) = (E,\\\\lambda \\\\Phi) for \\\\lambda \\\\in \\\\Complex^*. For abelian cohomology, such a \\\\Complex^* action gives rise to a Hodge structure, which is a generalisation of the Hodge decomposition of the cohomology of a compact K√§hler manifold. One way of understanding the nonabelian Hodge theorem is to use the \\\\Complex^* action on the moduli space M_B^+ to obtain a Hodge filtration. This can lead to new topological invariants of the underlying manifold X. For example, one obtains restrictions on which groups may appear as the fundamental groups of compact K√§hler manifolds in this way.

Military test  From September 20 to 27, 1950, the U.S. Navy released the pathogens off the shore of San Francisco. Based on results from monitoring equipment at 43 locations around the city, the Army determined that San Francisco had received enough of a dose for nearly all of the city's 800,000 residents to inhale at least 5,000 of the particles.Leonard A. Cole, Clouds of Secrecy: The Army's Germ Warfare Tests Over Populated Areas - Special Report No. 142: \\"Biological Warfare Trials at San Francisco, California, 20‚Äì27 September 1950\\". Illnesses On October 11, 1950, eleven residents checked into Stanford Hospital for very rare, serious urinary tract infections. Although ten residents recovered, one patient, Edward J. Nevin, died three weeks later. None of the other hospitals in the city reported similar spikes in cases, and all 11 victims had urinary-tract infections following medical procedures, suggesting that the source of their infections lay inside the hospital. Cases of pneumonia in San Francisco also increased after Serratia marcescens was released, though a causal relation has not been conclusively established. The bacterium was also combined with phenol and an anthrax simulant and sprayed across south Dorset by US and UK military scientists as part of the DICE trials which ran from 1971 to 1975.Jim Carlton,Of Microbes and Mock Attacks: Years Ago, The Military Sprayed Germs on U.S. Cities, The Wall Street Journal, (October 22, 2001). The urinary tract outbreak was so unusual that the Stanford doctors wrote it up for a medical journal. There was no evidence that the Army had alerted health authorities before it blanketed the region with bacteria. Doctors later wondered whether the experiment might be responsible for heart valve infections around the same time as well as serious infections seen among intravenous drug users in the 1960s and 1970s.Bernadette Tansey, Serratia has dark history in region / Army test in 1950 may have changed microbial ecology, San Francisco Chronicle, (October 31, 2004). Senate subcommittee hearings In 1977 Senate subcommittee hearings, the U.S. Army disclosed the existence of the tests. Army officials noted the pneumonia outbreak in their testimony but said any link to their experiments was totally coincidental. The Army pointed out that no other hospitals reported similar outbreaks and all 11 victims had urinary- tract infections following medical procedures, suggesting that the source of their infections lay inside the hospital. Lawsuit In 1981 Nevin's surviving family members filed suit against the federal government, alleging negligence and responsibility for the death of Edward J. Nevin, as well as financial and emotional harm caused to Mr. Nevin's wife from the medical costs. The lower court ruled against them primarily because the bacteria used in the test was unproven to be responsible for Mr. Nevin's death. The Nevin family appealed the suit all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to overturn lower court judgments.Secret Testing in the United States, The American Experience \\"In the event, the courts ruled against them, the main reason being that the plaintiffs could not prove that the bacteria used in the test were the same as those that killed Mr. Nevin.\\"Judge's Decision Expected Soon in California Germ Warfre (sic) Case, New York Times, (April 15, 1981) Similar tests In Senate subcommittee hearings in 1977 the Army revealed: * Between 1949 and 1969 open-air tests of biological agents were conducted 239 times. In 80 of those experiments, the Army said it used live bacteria that its researchers at the time thought were harmless. In the others, it used inert chemicals to simulate bacteria. * In the 1950s army researchers dispersed Serratia on Panama City and Key West Florida with no known illnesses resulting. * In the 1950s army researchers dispersed zinc cadmium sulfide (now a known cancer-causing agent) over Minnesota and other Midwestern states to see how far they would spread in the atmosphere. The particles were detected more than 1,000 miles away in New York state. * Bacillus globigii, never shown to be harmful to people, was released in San Francisco, New York, Washington, D.C., and along the Pennsylvania Turnpike, among other places. * In New York, military researchers in 1966 spread Bacillus subtilis variant Niger, also believed to be harmless, in the subway system by dropping lightbulbs filled with the bacteria onto tracks in stations in midtown Manhattan. The bacteria were carried for miles throughout the subway system. Army officials concluded in a January 1968 report that: \\"Similar covert attacks with a pathogenic disease-causing agent during peak traffic periods could be expected to expose large numbers of people to infection and subsequent illness or death.\\" * In a May 1965 secret release of Bacillus globigii at Washington's National Airport and its Greyhound Lines bus terminal more than 130 passengers were exposed to the bacteria traveling to 39 cities in seven states in the two weeks following the mock attack.

First established in the early 1900s, it has a long history of road, criterium and track racing. As a club, Carnegie- Cauflied has won multiple cycling premierships at both senior and junior level. Its members have gone on to win multiple National and World Championships as well as participate at the Olympics. Club history Originally known as the Carnegie Amateur Cycling club, the club traces its history back over 100 years. Early races were typically handicap races over 10‚Äì60-mile road courses, often starting at the Rosstown Hotel before making their way along Dandenong Road. The club also played a big part in the local community, in particular through its support for the Oakleigh Carnival. Around this time, the club formalised the first incarnation of its junior program recorded in 1931 after early success in the Victoria Club Premierships. At the same time, Carnegie's senior team also won major races. During the 1950s, Carnegie track racing, held at its local track Packer Park, drew crowds of up to 4000 spectators watching some of Australia's best amateur and professional riders. The quality of Carnegie's track racing was a key driver behind the push by the NSW Cycling Union to move the 1956 Melbourne Olympics Track Cycling programme to the Carnegie velodrome after delays in the resurfacing of the Olympic Park Velodrome. Although the push did not succeed ‚Äì the Olympic Track program was held at Olympic Park ‚Äì subsequent issues with the Olympic Track created a second push to move the Australian Titles (to be held after the Olympics) to the Carnegie Velodrome. Club logo circa 1980 Carnegie's track racing program become even more popular during the 1960s and 70's with the Caulfield Cup on Wheels being the leading race for amateur cyclists in Melbourne, often being held on the same night as the Melbourne Cup on Wheels, an equivalent race for professional cyclists. In 1984, Carnegie Amateurs Cycling Club merged with Brighton-South Caulfield Professional Cyclists Association to form Carnegie Caulfield Cycling Club. More recently, the club's summer criterium racing has become very popular, attracting some of the best riders in the World and is regularly covered in leading cycling publications including Cyclingnews.com.

In summer, criterium races are held on Sunday mornings at Glenvale Crescent and Tuesday evenings at Sandown International Raceway. The club also holds track racing and training during summer. Over winter, the club runs longer road races east of Melbourne. Criterium racing Between October and April each summer, Carnegie Caulfield holds weekly criterium races on Sunday mornings at Glenvale Crescent, Mulgrave and on Tuesday evenings at Sandown International Raceway. Races are typically between 45 and 60 minutes and are conducted on circuits with little to no vehicle traffic.

The locals claim their village to be birthplace of the legendary king Ravana, who rules Lanka in the epic Ramayana. During the Dussehara festival, which celebrates Rama's victory over Ravana, effigies of Ravana are burnt in several parts of India. However, in Bisrakh, the nine days of Navratra ending in Dassehara are observed as a period of mourning when they offer prayers for peace to the soul of Ravana and perform Yagna. Locals believe that if Ramlila were to be performed in the village, it would trigger the wrath of Ravana on the villagers. Location Bisrakh is a small village, in the Gautam Budh Nagar district which adjoins the urban center of Noida, and which still retains an ancient layout consisting of narrow lanes, dirty and potted roads. It is the headquarters of the administrative center of Bishrak Block in western Uttar Pradesh. It is away from the national capital, New Delhi. Legends Ravana According to a local legend, the name of the village is a derivation of Vishravas, father of Ravana, who was a famous sage of the ancient times who lived and worshipped Shiva in this village. Ravana who was born in this village had spent his early childhood here. Vishravas had found a linga in the forest area and had established the Bisrakh Dhaam (abode of God) with the linga deified therein where he offered worship. According to mythology, Vishravas, a Brahmin, had wedded Kaikesi, a rakshasa princess; Ravana thus had a mix of Brahmin and rakshasa (not demon in Indian mythology rakshasa cannot be literally translated to demon) blood. Vishravas's elder son by his first wife was Kubera, now worshipped as a god of wealth, who ruled Lanka until Ravana became the king himself. According to local belief celebrations of Ramlila in Bisrakh would invite the wrath of Ravana.[Bisrakh- Bleeding Pen](<nowiki>https://www.bleedingpen.in/2019/12/Bisrakh-the-place- where-ravan-is-devoted.html</nowiki> ) Instead, fire sacrifices or Yajnas are held during Navratra festival to the Shiva linga praying homage to Ravana.  Temples  Several temples exist in the village that are over 1,000 years old. The Swayambhu (self manifest) Shiva linga, which was worshiped by Ravana and his father Vishravas, was unearthed more than 100 years ago. It is octagonal in shape. The linga is visible above the surface for height and a further length is said to extend below the ground. It is deified in a temple here and worshipped daily. The temple is set near a large banyan tree and has a courtyard laid with marble. A new temple dedicated to Ravana is under construction at a cost of Rs 2 crores. This temple will be deified with a Shiva Linga and a image of Ravana. Demographics According to 2011 Census, the village has a total population of 5,470 (24.31% consist of Scheduled Caste) population of 882 families; 2,921 are males and 2,549 females with an average sex ratio of 767 much less than the Uttar Pradesh state average of 902. Literacy rate is 77.58% which is higher than the state's figure of 68.01%. Economy The economy of the village and the Bishrakh Block was mainly agriculture to the extent of 70% with the balance 30% related on non-agricultural activities of people such as teachers, administrative and police officials, politicians, carpenters, shopkeepers, barbers, and also agricultural labour. The village, compared to the rest of the Block, has non-farmer elitists, and elite farmers who own land area of 40 bighas or more, with the richest farmer owning 300 bighas. However, the economy is still considered \\"subsistence level.\\" for the village as a whole.

Early life Patrick Goold was born in Cork, Ireland, in 1814, the son of Michael Henry and Elizabeth Mahoney Goold. As part of the British Army, he came to the Cape Colony in 1835, where he served on the frontier for the next few decades - working more with logistics than in actual combat. He became a prominent merchant on the eastern frontier after discharge. He also formed the Veterans Volunteer Force in 1877, of which he became Captain. On 6 August 1849 he married Ellen Cullopy. Political career Cartoon critical of responsible government. Goold is shown as the mouse on the far right, holding the cheese labelled \\"East London Harbour Works\\" He settled in the frontier town of King William's Town, and in 1869 he stood with Charles Abercrombie Smith in the hotly contested election for that district. Goold and Smith were elected as Members of the Cape Parliament (House of Assembly). Controversially, Goold was a Catholic, and both he and Smith were relative liberals, elected by a conservative and Protestant district. In parliament he was strictly independent. However he soon came to be one of a group of Eastern Province MPs who strongly supported the movement for Responsible Government (or \\"self-rule\\" as Goold preferred to call it) led by John Molteno, and the allied movement for Voluntaryism (complete separation of Church and State) led by Saul Solomon. He was noted for hardly ever speaking in the house, but for his slow, hard-hitting and very humorous eloquence when he did speak. He retired soon after Responsible Government and Voluntarism were successfully introduced in 1872.Prominent men of Cape Colony, South Africa. Portland, Maine: Lakeside Press, 1902.

Within a week of having become Premier in 1903, Arthur Morgan appointed O'Sullivan to the Queensland Legislative Council. During his term he was the Government Representative in the Legislative Council. He resigned from the Council in January, 1906 to contest the seat of Warwick in a by-election to replace Arthur Morgan, who had resigned to join the Legislative Council. This time he was successful, winning by 449 votes to 435 against his competitor, George Barnes. He was appointed Secretary for Public Works in January 1906, serving until February 1907 when he was also given role of Agriculture, serving until November 1907. In the 1908 election, O'Sullivan was once again up against Barnes, this time the latter was successful, winning by 1297 votes to 1206. Within two weeks of losing his seat, O'Sullivan was reappointed to the Legislative Council, the Premier this time being William Kidston. He immediately returned to the role of Secretary for Agriculture in 1908, and then in October of that year he was made Attorney-General and remained in the position until June, 1915. He resigned in December 1915 to take up his appointment to the District Courts. Personal life On 20 January 1886, O'Sullivan married Rosanna Mellin (d. 1937) at St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney. He had been a President of the Queensland Irish Association and the Johnsonian Club and was a member of the Constitutional Club. Survived by three sons and two daughters, O'Sullivan died at his home in February, 1953.

The enclosure includes the Notre-Dame church, ossuary and calvary. The church was built in the 15th Century and much enlarged in 1597 when the chapel was added. The Renaissance porch, located on the south side of the church, was added in 1610 with statues of the apostles. The calvary separates the church from the ossuary. Inside the church is a notable baptismal font and a number of wood carvings dating to the 17th century. The bell tower is of the \\"l√©onard\\" style. It was hit by lightning in 1702 but restored in 1714. There is a note in the church archives dated 1713, recording that many women sold their rings to help fund the reconstruction. It is a listed historical monument. Eglise Notre-Dame Ossuary The ossuary at Tr√©maou√©zan This Gothic style building has an elegant door decorated with two angels bearing inscriptions, one in French, the other in Breton. This translates as \\"Cursed be those who speak ill and Main altar and stained glass window The choir was redesigned on two occasions in the 20th century. The stained glass window depicts scenes from Pentecost in the central panel and in the side panels, the Annunciation and the Nativity on one side and the Resurrection and the Assumption on the other. The tabernacle on the main altar is the work of the sculptor Yves Rolland. Baptistry The font is surmounted by a baldachin supported by six Corinthian columns. It comprises a spectacular dome with niches in which are statues of the apostles and to the rear of the whole structure are three statues recreating the scene of Jesus' baptism. Jesus himself is shown with John the Baptist whilst an angel stands to Jesus' rear holding his cloak. A font in rose-coloured marble replaced the original font in 1860. Saint Sebastian altarpiece The altarpiece, one of a total of five in the church, features a painting depicting Saint Sebastian and Saint Roch. Both were saints invoked as protection against the plague and appear frequently in the decoration in parish closes of the Elorn valley. The tree to which Saint Sebastian is tied, whilst pierced by arrows, carries the growths, called \\"bubons\\", which were one of the symptoms of the plague. In his left hand he holds a palm, the symbol in religious art of martyrdom. In the painting Saint Roch, who died from leprosy, lifts his cloak to show the sores on his leg. When he lived as a hermit, legend has it that a dog brought him his daily bread, and the painting includes a dog. Saint Anne altarpiece Saint Anne sits with a book of holy writings on her lap. She rests her right hand on the book and with one finger of the other hand she touches the finger of Jesus. Next to her the Virgin Mary has Jesus on her lap. He stands with open arms and above him is a dove with open wings. The baroque surrounding depicts Saint Pol at the top slaying a dragon and features an angel blowing a trumpet. The altarpiece also has a 1560 statue of Saint Germaine of Auxerre. The Saint Anne altarpiece is the work of Herv√© and Jacques Le Roux, painters and sculptors. \\"Notre-Dame\\" altarpiece This altarpiece includes a statue of the Virgin Mary with child and on the pedestal is a sign reading \\"Notre Dame du Mont Carmel\\". There is also a statue of Saint Joseph, also holding a baby and an \\"Ecce Homo\\". Altar of the dead The baroque altar is shaped like a tomb and is decorated with skull and crossbones. A painting depicting purgatory stands between two sculptures. In the painting an angel flies beneath Jesus whilst two women raise their hands upwards and another two look up at him. In the centre a man seems to be calling to the onlooker to take note of what he is seeing. South porch The porch here is a fine example of the great south porches of the parish enclosures. It was built in 1610 and greets visitors with the words \\"DOMVS : MEA : DOMVS : ORATIONIS : VOCABITVR\\" or \\"My house will be called the house of prayer\\". The facade is a splendid example of Renaissance architecture and a statue of the Virgin Mary is positioned over the entrance. There is a campanile at the very top. Statues in the south porch The Holy Father wearing a papal crown holds in his hands the still body of his son, a variant on the more usual piet√† where Jesus is held by his mother. By his side are statues of Saint Vincent Ferrier and Saint Gouesnou. The fourth statue is of Saint Fiacre, the gardener monk with his large ears, such ears said to be essential for the good gardener. Porch interior The porch interior is as remarkable as the fa√ßade with Roland Dor√© statues of the apostles each on a dais surmounted by the carving of a crescent moon. Two doors framed by a Gothic arch then give access to the church itself and above them is a statue of the Virgin Mary with child.

As children, Michiru and Shuta, who carried Saku because he has a weak heart, climbed to the top of a hill and, saw a rainbow there together. Years later Michiru decides to go to England to study but she can't bring herself to tell them face-to-face. She only tells Saku, and only in a sealed letter she asks Shuta to give him the day she's leaving, December 21, 2010. On the way to deliver the letter Shuta's bike breaks down so he asks to borrow Saku's bike to get to a basketball game. Saku dies while running at top speed from his house to get to the station to see Michiru off. Shuta feels responsible for the death. After that Shuta and Michiru drift apart and lose contact. Two years later, December 20, 2012, Shuta attends Saku's death anniversary. He is invited to take a memento and he picks Saku's \\"You're a Time Traveler\\" watch, supposedly capable of rewinding time. Shuta takes a train home while wearing the watch and is surprised to find he has returned in time to December 20, 2010, the day before Saku's death. Michiru calls Shuta and Saku to clean the school (it's a custom in Japan for children to clean the school). To please Michiru, Shuta agrees to put up prisms in the lab's windows to create a rainbow effect. A passing basketball team member, annoyed that Shuta didn't come to practice with the team, hits him with a ball and Shuta is suddenly sent back to the morning of December 20, 2012. He gets to the school to meet with Professor. Matsudo, his eccentric former science teacher, and discovers that the future has been altered slightly, because Matsudo now remembers the prisms in the window.. On the third time he goes back in time, Shuta goes again to the school and sees a shamanistic ritual through a window that is supposed to summon Kyoko, the spirit of a girl who committed suicide there. The science teacher startles him when she comes through a door unexpectedly, dressed for the ritual. The shock sends him to the morning of December 20, 2012 again. He repeats the routine for that 2012 morning, then, after traveling back 2 years as usual, runs to the school and claims he doesn't know how he disappeared from Saku's and Michiru's presence. The science teacher hypnotizes him to try to get his memory back and he seeks Kyoko. He learns that Kyoko is not dead but has been a \\"time prisoner\\" since World War II and can only be seen by willing time-travellers. Kyoko warns Shuta time is a law of nature and messing with it could make the future worse rather than better. However, she agrees to help him by showing him the \\"Jack Fin\\" technique: change as little of the past and do nothing dramatically different. That evening in 2010 he tries to entice Michiru confess her plans to leave for England the next day but she resists. At midnight Shuta discovers that, as the day passes from December 20 to 21, he returns to the year 2012. He find that Saku's mother has taken an overdose of pills and collapsed at her home and realizes what Kyoko's had meant. Then he finds that Kyoko has taken the watch and she begs him not to interfere with time again. She warns him that if he does, everyone's memories of him, including his, will be completely erased. He will end up like her: invisible to everyone and forgotten. Despite this, Shuta chooses to sacrifice himself to save Saku, so Kyoko gives the watch to him. Going back in time for the fourth time, Shuta is thrown into the afternoon of December 21, 2010, right before his basketball match. The version we see coming to the court is the Shuta from that time. We can tell because he's not wearing the watch and because getting hit with a basketball doesn't shock him into the future. The one from 2012 quizzes the \\"historic\\" Shuta to make certain Michiru's letter was delivered. 2012 Shuta then races towards the train station with Saku on his bike and is able to meet with Michiru. There, Shuta reads Michiru's letter and is surprised to learn that Michiru does not love Saku, as he previously thought, but him. Shuta was able to save Saku's life, but everyone's memories of Shuta, except Kyoko's, are erased. She can't leave the school, but she promises herself never to forget him. Years later, Shuta is shown at the beach picking a prism of quartz. Saku and Michiru are passing by, hand in hand, and Michiru says it's very pretty.

He has also taught at American universities of Princeton in New Jersey, Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago; and European Architectural Association in London, EPFL Lausanne, Ljubljana and Alicante. It has approached the architecture to the world of art in the second half of the twentieth century with collaborations with artists as different kinds Antoni Muntadas or the American Dan Graham. In 1984 he founded √Åbalos & Herreros and in 1999 the LMI (Multimedia International League). He has been juror in several national and international competitions, biennials and international awards, editorial advisor of specialized media and member of several expert committees on academic, sustainability and technology programs such as the Material Science Congress at the University of Columbia. His work has explored since the organizational principles of skyscrapers as a generator of generic multifunctional typologies. They were also pioneers in the use of diagrams and abstract information as display mechanism of non- evident relationships. In 2008 the firm √Åbalos & Herreros, began to perform as two different platforms differentiating projects signed by Juan Herreros of those under the authorship of √Åbalos. Herreros presented two projects at that time as the beginning of a new stage: A house on the island of Mallorca and architectural design of the art fair ARCO in Madrid; in which he applied urban criteria for space allocation and management of program uses. In 2008 he founded the Herreros Arquitectos after the break with I√±aki Abalos until 2014 where he accomplished the rebuilding of their practice under the name estudio Herreros, from which plays a triple role: practitioner, teacher and researcher. His theoretical work currently focuses on his work and seminars on \\"Emerging Practices in Architecture\\" which takes its name from the Research Group directed at the Polytechnic University of Madrid based on the idea of recycling the figure of the architect and his techniques in light of new economic coordinates and the crisis of traditional modes of production which hinder the incorporation of new generations to the practice of architecture techniques. Juan Herreros is an International Fellow of the RIBA (Royal Institute of British Architects); he has been awarded the Architectural Digest prize, the Medal of Arts from the city of San Lorenzo de El Escorial, named ‚ÄòArchitect of the World‚Äô by the Architects‚Äô Association of the city of Lima and adoptive son of the city of Cochabamba, and has been nominated to the U.S. Academy of Arts and Letters Architecture Medal.

He has been a professor of anthropology at Stony Brook University in New York since 1992. Background Shea was born in 1960 to Joseph P. and Gloria C. (Cyr) Shea. In 1982 he earned a BA in Archaeology and Anthropology from Boston University and a Ph.D. from Harvard in Anthropology in 1991. His first doctoral advisor was Glynn Isaac, after whose death, Ofer Bar-Yosef, David Pilbeam, and K.C. Chang oversaw his training. Shea has conducted archaeological fieldwork in Israel, Jordan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Belize, New Mexico, and Massachusetts. He is married to Patricia L. Crawford and resides in Stony Brook, New York and Santa Fe, New Mexico. Work Shea's research focuses on stone tools and how they relate to major issues in human evolution. He has experience in flintknapping and other ancient technologies. He is specialized in Paleoanthropology, the evolution of hominin behavior, pleistocene archaeology of the Near East and of Eastern Africa, lithic analysis, as well as experimental archaeology Highlights of Shea's research include the following, in rough chronological order. * Identification of stone-tipped spears used by Neanderthals and early Homo sapiens in the East Mediterranean Levant. * Excavations at 'Ubeidiya, a 1.4 Million year-old site in the Jordan Valley, Israel. This research was conducted jointly with Ofer Bar-Yosef, Eitan Tchernov, Gerhard Bosinski, Sabine Gaudzinski, and Miriam Belmaker. * Excavations at Ar Rasfa, a Middle Paleolithic site in Jordan. This research was conducted jointly with Patricia Crawford and Ghufran Sabri Ahmad (Univ. Mosul). * Experimental and morphometric identifications of early complex projectile technology in Africa, the Near East and Europe. This work was done jointly with Zach Davis, Kyle Brown, and Mat Sisk. This project's core finding was that complex projectile technology (bow and arrow, spear thrower and dart) were major factors in how humans dispersing from Africa displaced Neandertals and other extinct hominins in temperate Eurasia. * Paleoanthropology of the Lower Omo Valley Kibish Formation. This project recovered 200,000 year-old archaeological remains and fossils of the oldest-known Homo sapiens. This research was carried out with John Fleagle, Frank Brown, Solomon Yerga, Zelalem Assefa, Ian Wallace and others. * Proposed replacing Paleolithic archaeological research on \\"behavioral modernity\\" with a new focus on \\"behavioral variability.\\" * Stone Tools in the Paleolithic and Neolithic of the Near East: A Guide.

Gameplay The gameplay is a mixture of platforming and puzzle solving. Gradually the player unlocks the ability to change seasons at their will, manipulating the environment to allow the player to progress. For example, switching to winter will cause lakes to freeze, so they can be walked over, and then switching to fall will cause strong winds in certain areas, which lift up some platforms. Flying jellyfish can be used as modes of transportation. Certain plants will allow the fox to jump higher. The game will not contain a steep difficulty curve in an attempt to feel generous to players. The player cannot actually die or lose ‚Äì there are no \\"enemies\\" to speak of, but rather the game's main obstacles come in the form of figuring out what to do and where to go next. Plot The game follows a Red fox as it traverses a mysterious forest in an effort to rescue the lost spirits of the four seasons.

The 222nd Mixed Brigade (), was a mixed brigade of the Spanish Republican Army in the Spanish Civil War. It was formed in the summer of 1937 with battalions of the Carabineros corps. Its only commander was the Carabineros Lieutenant Tiburcio D√≠az Carrasco.Carlos Engel, Historia de las Brigadas Mixtas del E. P. de la Rep√∫blica, 1999; p. 221 History The 222nd Mixed Brigade was established in the summer 1937 in Lorca, V√©lez-Rubio, Alhama and Totana. It was organized with the following Carabineros battalions: *18th, which became the 885 Battalion of the mixed brigade. *19th, which became the 886 Battalion. *24th, which became the 887 Battalion. *38th, which became the 888 Battalion. Two of these battalions were from the 86th Mixed Brigade. First phase The brigade was first engaged in Coastal Defence under the Group of Central Region Armies (GERC) and its members were garrisoned in Cartagena, guarding the town's military facilities. In December 1937 the 222nd Mixed Brigade became part of the reserve of the Andalusian Army, relieving the 87th Mixed Brigade of its duties in the coast of Almer√≠a. In late February 1938 the unit was placed under the 40th Division of the XIX Army Corps of the Levantine Army (Ej√©rcito de Levante) and moved to the Teruel Front. However it arrived to the Teruel area when the combats were over. Levante Offensive and end of the unit The brigade took part in the effort to fight back the rebel Levante Offensive where it recaptured the Cota 1.196 and the V√©rtice Marr√≥n positions from the enemy. For these actions the 40th Division, to which the brigade belonged, was awarded the Medal of Bravery. In July 1938 the 40th Division was placed under the XVII Army Corps led by Lieutenant Colonel Garc√≠a Vallejo. When the Francoist offensive in the Levant ended, the brigade remained in the same sector as strategic reserve until the end of the Civil War. The final fate of some of the brigade's members is unknown.

These days, however, acreage under this variety declined sharply, forcing it to near extinction, for various reasons, some of which are * outburst of Panicle blast epidemics during two consecutive years: 1998 and 1999 * tall stature of the crop causing lodgingGrains of Kalanamak rice * long duration of harvest (6 to 7 months) * non-availability of quality seeds and research support * Kalanamak was grown widely in Tarai belt of Uttar Pradesh, which comprised districts Siddharth Nagar, Sant Kabir Nagar, Maharajganj, Basti, Gonda, and Gorakhpur. Until 30 years ago, the variety covered more than 10% of total rice cultivation area in Siddharthanagar. However, acreage growing this variety in this district declined to <0.5% of total rice area during 2002. History Picture of fossilized grain of Kalanamak rice found during the excavation of Aligarhwa, Siddharthnagar, Uttar Pradesh (believed to be a part of Kapilvastu). Image taken from book 'A Treatise On The Secented rices of India' by R.K. Singh and U.S. Singh page 425 Rediscovering Scented Rice Cultivar Kalanamak; Reproduced from Asian Agri-History Vol. 9, No. 3, 2005 (211‚Äì219) Kalanamak rice has been cultivated since the Buddhist period (600 BC). The kalanamak grains were found from excavation of Aligarhwa (Siddharthnagar district, Uttar Pradesh, India), located at Nepal border. Aligarhwa has been identified as the real Kapilvastu, the Kingdom of King ≈öuddhodana, father of Gautama Buddha. During excavation of Aligarhwa carbonized rice grains resembling Kalanamak were recovered from one of the rooms, which was identified to be the kitchen store. Faxian, the famous Chinese monk wrote that when Gautama Buddha (Lord Buddha) visited Kapilvastu for the first time after attaining ‚Äòenlightenment‚Äô, while passing through Bajha jungle, he was stopped at Mathla village by the people. The villagers asked Siddhartha to give them ‚Äòprasad‚Äô. Siddhartha took the rice he had taken in alms and gave it to the people, asking them to sow it in a marshy place. The rice thus produced ‚Äúwill have typical aroma which will always remind people of me,‚Äù he said. Since then Bajha jungle has vanished and its place has been taken by Bajha village near Kapilvastu. Instead of Mathla, now Mudila village exists. The actual belt of Kalanamak rice is still believed to be the tract between Bajha and Aligarhwa. This variety, if sown elsewhere, loses its aroma and quality. The first effort for the conservation of Kalanamak was made by the Englishmen William Pepe, J H Hemprey, and Edcan Walker (Jamindars of Alidapur, Birdpur, and Mohana) during the British Raj. They built four reservoirs at Bajha, Marthi, Moti, and Majhauli to produce Kalanamak in a large quantity. They not only produced this variety for their own consumption, but transported it to England from Uska-bazar mandi, passing through Dhaka (now in Bangladesh) via sea route. Due to its increasing demand, the British captured the land around Kapilvastu, and established Birdpur and Alidapur states. They produced Kalanamak through bonded labor and exported to Britain. When the shrewd Gujarati businessmen came to know about its business potential they formed a mandi at Uska-bazar to export Kalanamak. To counter them the British ‚Äúshopkeepers‚Äù built a rail route to carry rice on the goods train. But after independence, Uska-bazar mandi became nonfunctional due to negligence, and reservoirs gathered silt. This led to a fall in production of Kalanamak. All these evidences indicate that Kalanamak has been cultivated in Siddharthanagar area from or even before Buddhist period (600 BC). GI Tag GOVERNMENT OF INDIA GEOGRAPHICAL INDICATIONS JOURNAL NO. 48 NOVEMBER 29, 2012 / AGRAHAYANA 08, SAKA 1934Kalanamak Rice has been granted the Geographical Indication(GI) Tag in 2012 by the Government of India and a geographical area has been defined where the Kalanamak rice can be produced. Kalanamak rice grown in this defined area can only be labelled as Kalanamak rice. Geographical area for Kalanamak rice lies between 27¬∞ 28‚Ä≤ North Latitude and 82¬∞ 45‚Ä≤ to 83¬∞ 10‚Ä≤ East Longitude in the State of Uttar Pradesh . Geographical Area of production of Kalanamak Rice is Bazardeeh, Bazahaw, Dubaripur, Dewra, Mohanjot, Siyao,Niyao Ramwapur, Doharia Khurd, Doharia-Bujurg, Naugarh & Aligarahawa villages of Siddharthnagar District. Kalanamak rice has been granted the Geographical Indication(GI) Tag which was applied to the Government of India by Kalanamak Scented Paddy Production & Conservation Society. The GI tag is an indication which is definite to a geographical territory. It is used for agricultural, natural and manufactured goods. Quality Comparison of the grain length of cooked and uncooked kernel of Kalanamak rice grain. The Elongation after cooking is almost 2.2 times the grain length Kalanamak rice is said to outshine even the most exclusive Basmati rice in all quality traits except grain length. Kalanamak rice is a non-basmati rice with short to medium grain length. Aroma of Kalanamak rice, which is said to be the gift of Gautam Buddha, is stronger than all Basmati varieties. Elongation after cooking, which is one of the most important quality trait in the international rice market, is 40% greater than Basmati rice. http://vcampus.uom.ac.mu/sugar/education/sugarnhealth/rice.htmCooked kalanamak is softer and fluffier that other rice varieties. Amylose content is close to 20% as compared to 24% and higher in Basmati. High amylose levels tend to make the rice cook firm and dry. Rice with a medium amylose content of between 16% and 22% usually cooks softer and the grains stick together more readily. Health Benefits Kalanamak rice is rich in micro-nutrients such as Iron and Zinc. Therefore, having this rice is said to prevent diseases borne out of Iron and Zinc deficiencies. It is said that regular intake of Kalanamak rice can prevent Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Government of India came out with Nutri- Farm scheme in 2013, with the aim to promote food crops that have critical micro nutrients to fight malnutrition and improve nutrition status of the vulnerable section of society. Kalanamak rice was one of the nutri-crop selected for this scheme. References 1\\\\. Chaudhary, R. C. 1979a. Productive mutants in scented rices in Uttar Pradesh. Proc. Symp.

The work was composed between February 1937 and August 1938 while Herrmann was music director at CBS and it was premiered in 1940 at Carnegie Hall in New York City by the New York Philharmonic under the conductor John Barbirolli.Leonard, p. 601. The piece is dedicated to Herrmann's friend and fellow composer Charles Ives. Composition Hermann originally conceived Moby Dick as an opera, but found the novel too vast in scope and instead asked the librettist Clark Harrington to help him adapt the work into a cantata. While composing the work, Herrmann and Harrington took trips to Massachusetts in the summers of 1937 and 1938 to research the novel. Herrmann later revised the work in 1973, having previously recorded it with the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1967. The completed work lasts approximately 45 minutes in performance and is composed primarily in tonal Romanticism. James Leonard of the AllMusic Guide has compared the work to that of Herrmann's 20th-century contemporaries Arnold Bax, Frederick Delius, and Ralph Vaughan Williams. Reception Phillip Scott of Limelight praised the work as \\"dramatic and skilfully orchestrated, befitting a born film composer, with tension deftly maintained throughout the work's 46 minutes.\\" Andrew Clements of The Guardian described the cantata as being \\"much closer to the world of Herrmann's later film music\\" and \\"a mix of imposing choral set-pieces, orchestral interludes and solo narrations.\\" Mark Swed of the Los Angeles Times also praised the work, calling it an \\"unjustly neglected\\" cantata.

History Winemaking has been developed in Hersonissos, the Bosporan Kingdom, in the Principality of Theodoro and the Genoese colonies. The Ottoman period was unfavourable to wine because of religious prohibition, but that was offset by the cult of table grapes. Although winemakers Muslims and punish sticks for the production of the drink, but Muslims are not subject to exorbitant taxes, which stimulated some move to another faith. The period of the Russian Empire and the later Soviet period led to significant development for the industry and the emergence of a true scientific approach to wine production. The adoption on April 24, 1914 of the \\"Law on grape wine\\" increased the vulnerability of the industry at the legislative level. The adoption on 25 May 1985 of the resolution entitled \\"Measures to Overcome Drunkenness and Alcoholism\\" led to substantial damage to Crimean and Soviet winemaking. It was during this period that many vineyards were destroyed and wineries were converted into extract plants. The greatest reduction in the area of vineyards and consequent reduction in the volume of wine production in Crimea occurred after the collapse of the USSR. Current situation The current stage of development of viticulture and winemaking in Crimea is associated with the reorientation of producers from the Ukrainian to the Russian market, a process made more difficult by the requirement to adhere to the new regulatory framework of Russia. In general, using protectionist mechanisms, the industry has chances for development and access to foreign markets (especially the Asia-Pacific region).

Following the end of the war he remained in Ireland where he oversaw the rebuilding of several major forts. In 1609 he was entrusted with the Bodley Survey which mapped out terrain for the Ulster Plantation. Early life He was the son of John Bodley a merchant from Exeter, and the younger brother of the scholar Sir Thomas Bodley, known for his involvement in the Bodleian Library. Josias spent some of his youth abroad, where his Protestant father had gone as a Marian exile during reign of the Catholic Mary I. He attended Merton College, Oxford before travelling around Europe. He then joined the English forces fighting for the Dutch Republic against Spain in the Low Countries. By 1598 he had reached the rank of Captain. Ireland Bodley served during the Nine Years' War in Ireland, where Crown forces were battling against the rebellion of Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone. At the decisive Battle of Kinsale Bodley was appointed as \\"Trenchmaster\\" (Chief Engineer) of the Anglo-Irish troops under Lord Mountjoy besieging a Spanish expeditionary force. He later served in Ulster, taking part in the storming of one of Tyrone's great fortresses at Lough Lurcan (modern-day Moyrourkan Lough).Bardon p.28 He commanded the post of Armagh with 700 troops as a garrison.McGurk p.193 When the Treaty of Mellifont brought the war to an end he was given a command in the peacetime Irish Army like several other veterans.Bardon p.65 He was knighted in March 1604 and was subsequently appointed Inspector of Fortifications in Ireland. He was also made Governor of Duncannon Fort. Bodley Survey Following the Flight of the Earls in 1607 and the subsequent O'Doherty's Rebellion, the lands of several rebel Gaelic lords were confiscated and plans were drawn up for the settling of British immigrants alongside those loyal Gaelic leaders who were to be granted land. Bodley carried out a preliminary study of the terrain as a guide for London when the Ulster Plantation was being drawn up by James I and his government. In 1609 he headed a more detailed survey which systematically catalogued the Ulster landscape for the first time. This became the basis for grants made under the Plantation. The King was impressed by the work and later commissioned Bodley to perform further studies of Ulster. He died in 1618, and was buried in Ireland. He was succeeded in his post as Inspector of Fortifications by two replacements. He was later included in John Prince's book The Worthies of Devon. References Bibliography * Bardon, Jonathan.

Historically it was sometimes spelt as Birt Castle. It is also known by the name O'Doherty's Castle, and should not be mistaken for O'Doherty's Keep near Buncrana. The Castle was constructed in the sixteenth century during the reign of Henry VIII.Rowan p.28 It was a traditional stronghold of the O'Doherty's, protecting the southern edge of their Inishowen Lordship. The design of the Castle was strongly influenced by contemporary Z-Plan Scottish fortifications, and anticipated the style of buildings constructed during the Ulster Plantation of the following century.Rowan p.28 During a disputed succession in 1600, the Crown's Governor of Derry, Sir Henry Docwra, backed the successful candidate, the fifteen-year- old Sir Cahir O'Doherty. O'Doherty wished to break free of the overlordship of Red Hugh O'Donnell and fought on the Crown's side during the Nine Years' War and was knighted for his bravery. Burt Castle was a vital post because it controlled a strategic area, allowing Docwra to bring in food supplies and to open up an offensive again O'Donnell.McGurk p.216 A garrison of a hundred men under Captain John Vaughan were stationed there.McGurk p.193 Following the war O'Doherty continued in his loyalty to the Crown but in 1608, after a dispute with the new Governor of Derry, O'Doherty rose in revolt with the castle as his headquarters. The Burning of Derry in April triggered what became known as O'Doherty's Rebellion. In response the Dublin authorities sent troops to overrun O'Doherty's Inishowen heartlands. After a siege they captured Burt Castle and freed the prisoners taken at Derry who were being held there.McCavitt p.144-45 Shortly afterwards O'Doherty was killed at the Battle of Kilmacrennan and the rebellion collapsed. During the Williamite War the Castle was the site of a skirmish between Jacobite forces and troops under the overall command of General Percy Kirke who were supporting William III.

The earliest written references to the Slav ethnonym are in other languages.  Early mentions  Sporoi () or Spori was according to Eastern Roman scholar Procopius (500‚Äì560) the old name of the Antes and Sclaveni, two Early Slavic branches. Procopius stated that the Sclaveni and Antes spoke the same language, but he did not trace their common origin back to the Veneti (as per Jordanes) but to a people he called Sporoi. He derived the name from Greek (\\"I scatter grain\\"), because \\"they populated the land with scattered settlements\\". He described their society as democratic, and their language as barbaric. Roman bureaucrat Jordanes wrote about the Slavs in his work Getica (551): \\"although they derive from one nation, now they are known under three names, the Veneti, Antes and Sclaveni\\" (); that is, the West Slavs, East Slavs, and South Slavs. He stated that the Veneti were the ancestors of the Sclaveni and the Antes, the two having used to be called Veneti but are now \\"chiefly\\" (though, by implication, not exclusively) called Sclaveni and Antes.Jordanes, Getica 5. Jordanes' Veneti and Procopius' Sporoi were used for the ethnogenetic legend of the Slavs, the ancestors of the Slavs (the subsequent ethnic group name). Thus, the Slav ethnonym at first denoted the southern group of the early Slavs. This ethnonym is attested by Procopius in Byzantine Greek as ('), ('), ('), ('), or Œ£Œ∫ŒªŒ±Œ≤·øñŒΩŒøŒπ ('),Procopius, History of the Wars, VII. 14. 22‚Äì30, VIII. 40. 5. while his contemporary Jordanes refers to the Sclaveni in Latin.Jordanes, The Origin and Deeds of the Goths, V. 33. In Ancient Greek there are no words with the root sl-, thus the original ethnonym was transformed into skl-, as that root was present (in sklƒìr√≥s, \\"hard\\").  Church Slavonic manuscripts  In East Church Slavonic manuscripts, the ethnonym is spelt Slovƒõne (), such as in the Primary Chronicle, Sofia First Chronicle, Novgorod First Chronicle and Novgorod Fourth Chronicle. In the source dating to 898 included in the Primary Chronicle, the term is used both for East Slavic tribes and more often for a people (in the Kievan Rus' society, alongside Varangians, Chuds and Kriviches).  Etymology  The Slavic autonym *Slovƒõnin—ä is usually considered a derivation from slovo \\"word\\", originally denoting \\"people who speak (the same language)\\", i. e. people who understand each other, in contrast to the Slavic word denoting \\"foreign people\\", namely nƒõmci, meaning \\"mumbling, murmuring people\\" (from Slavic *nƒõm—ä \\"mumbling, mute\\"). The latter word may be the derivation of words to denote \\"Germans\\" or \\"Germanic peoples\\" in many later Slavic languages: e. g., Czech Nƒõmec, Slovak Nemec, Slovene Nemec, Belarusian, Russian and Bulgarian –ù–µ–º–µ—Ü, Serbian –ù–µ–º–∞—Ü, Croatian Nijemac, Polish Niemiec, Ukrainian –ù—ñ–º–µ—Ü—å, etc.,Stephen Barbour and Cathie Carmichael (eds.), Language and Nationalism in Europe (2000), p. 193. but another theory states that rather these words are derived from the name of the Nemetes tribe,The Journal of Indo-European studies, vol. 2 (1974) .Grzegorz Jagodzi≈Ñski, O przenoszeniu nazw lud√≥w . which is derived from the Celtic root nemeto-.Xavier Delamarre (2003). Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise. √âditions Errance, p. 233.John T. Koch (2006). Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia. ABC-CLIO, p. 1351. The word slovo (\\"word\\") and the related slava (\\"glory, fame, praise\\") and slukh (\\"hearing\\") originate from the Proto-Indo- European root (\\"be spoken of, glory\\"), cognate with Ancient Greek ( \\"fame\\"), whence comes the name Pericles, Latin (\\"be called\\"), and English . Alternative proposals for the etymology of *Slovƒõnin—ä propounded by some scholars have much less support. B. Philip Lozinski argues that the word *slava once had the meaning of \\"worshipper\\", in this context \\"practicer of a common Slavic religion\\", and from that evolved into an ethnonym.B. Philip Lozinski, \\"The Name 'Slav'\\", in: Essays in Russian History. A Collection Dedicated to George Vernadsky, edd. A. D. Ferguson and A. Levin. Archon Books, Hamden, Connecticut 1964, S. 19‚Äì32 (online text ). S. B. Bernstein speculated that it derives from a reconstructed Proto-Indo-European ', cognate to Ancient Greek ŒªŒ±œåœÇ (la√≥s) \\"population, people\\", which itself has no commonly accepted etymology.Bernstein 1961. Meanwhile, others theorize that Slavyane () is of toponymic origin, from a place named Slovo or a river named Slova; this, according to some, is implied by the suffix -enin. The Old East Slavic Slavuta for the Dnieper River was argued by Henrich Bartek (1907‚Äì1986) to be derived from slova and also the origin of Slovƒõne.Etudes slaves et est-europ√©ennes: Slavic and East-European studies, vol. 3 (1958), p. 107. The English term slave derives from the ethnonym Slav. In medieval wars many Slavs were captured and enslaved, which led to the word slav becoming synonym to \\"enslaved person\\". In addition, the English word Slav derives from the Middle English word sclave, which was borrowed from Medieval Latin sclavus or slavus, itself a borrowing and Byzantine Greek skl√°bos \\"slave,\\" which was in turn apparently derived from a misunderstanding of the Slavic autonym (denoting a speaker of their own languages). The Byzantine term Sklavinoi was loaned into Arabic as Saqaliba (ÿµŸÇÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ©; sing. Saqlabi, ÿµŸÇŸÑÿ®Ÿä) by medieval Arab historiographers. However, the origin of this word is disputed.F.

Tidal was launched in 2014 by Norwegian public company Aspiro and is now owned by Project Panther Bidco. With distribution agreements with all three major record labels and many independent labels, Tidal claims to offer access to more than 60 million tracks and 240,000 music videos. It offers two levels of service: Tidal Premium (lossy quality) and Tidal HiFi (lossless CD quality ‚Äì FLAC-based 16-Bit/44.1 kHz ‚Äì and MQA ‚Äì typically lossy 24-bit/96 kHz). Tidal claims to pay the highest percentage of royalties to music artists and songwriters within the music streaming market. In March 2015, Aspiro was acquired by Project Panther Bidco Ltd., which relaunched the service with a mass-marketing campaign, promoting it as the first artist-owned streaming service. On January 23, 2017, Sprint Corporation bought 33% of Tidal for a reported $200 million. While some observers praised the high fidelity, lossless audio quality, and higher subscription fees that would result in higher royalties to the artists and songwriters, others felt the high subscription fees and exclusive Tidal content from the artists involved could lead to more music piracy. Tidal has claimed to have over 3 million subscribers, although the veracity of those claims as well as their reported streaming numbers have been questioned. , Tidal operates in 55 countries. History Branching off from WiMP, which was launched in Norway in 2010 and later available in Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and Poland, Aspiro first launched the Tidal brand in the UK, the US, and Canada on October 28, 2014. The launch was supported by Sonos and 15 other home audio manufacturers as integrations partners. In January 2015, Tidal launched in five more European countries: Ireland, Finland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. Aspiro was purchased by Project Panther Bidco Ltd. for SEK 466 million (USD $56.2 million) in January 2015. Before the acquisition of Aspiro, Jay-Z stated in an interview with Billboard that he was willing to partner with other streaming services to carry out his vision. \\"We talked to every single service and we explored all the options,\\" he said, \\"But at the end of the day, we figured if we're going to shape this thing the way we see it, then we need to have independence. And that became a better proposition for us, not an easier one, mind you,\\" he concluded. On April 16, 2015, it came to public attention that Tidal was closing its original Aspiro offices in Stockholm, terminating the employment for all Swedish employees and the current CEO Andy Chen. The company refused to comment on closing the offices, but confirmed that Andy Chen had been replaced as CEO by Peter Tonstad. In September 2015, Tidal began selling digital downloads and CDs. In December 2015, Tidal appointed Jeff Toig as CEO of the company. Toig left the company in March 2017. Richard Sanders was announced as CEO in August 2017. In January 2017, the company announced a partnership with British company Master Quality Authenticated (MQA) to deliver master-quality recordings‚Äîauthenticated and unbroken versions (typically 96 kHz / 24-bit) with the highest-possible resolution to its HiFi subscribers. Tidal is the only streaming company to offer this MQA service. MQA is a \\"lossy\\" format. On January 23, 2017, US mobile carrier Sprint announced that they were buying a 33 percent stake in Tidal, and it was reported Sprint would offer exclusive content to Sprint customers. In September 2017, Tidal partnered with Mercedes-Benz's web portal app. American rapper Nicki Minaj starred in a commercial promoting the Mercedes partnership. In 2017, Tidal announced a series of podcasts to launch the same year. American rappers Fat Joe and Joey Badass each host \\"Coca Vision\\" and \\"47 Minutes\\" respectively. Platform exclusivity A key selling point for Tidal in relation to competing with other streaming services such as Spotify and Pandora Radio is the exclusive content already available and expected for the future from the current artists who co-own the company, as well as others. Exclusive content available on the relaunch of Tidal included Rihanna's single \\"Bitch Better Have My Money\\", The White Stripes debut television appearance, Daft Punk's Electroma (2006), and playlists personally curated by Jay-Z, Beyonc√©, Arcade Fire and Coldplay. Tidal stated on its official Twitter page that \\"lots of exclusive content [is] on the way\\". Jay-Z's catalogue was not available on Spotify, but was almost completely exclusive on Tidal until his 50th birthday. Artist ownership During the press conference, Jay-Z, Beyonc√©, Rihanna, Kanye West, Nicki Minaj, Daft Punk, Jack White, Madonna, Arcade Fire, Alicia Keys, Usher, Chris Martin, Calvin Harris, deadmau5, Jason Aldean and J. Cole were introduced to the stage as \\"the owners of TIDAL\\". Eric Harvey of Pitchfork stated of the artists who co-own the service, \\"These are the 1 percent of pop music in the world right now, these are artists who do not answer to record labels, do not answer to corporations.\\" On March 30, 2015, a press conference was held at Skylight at Moynihan Station in New York City, to officially relaunch Tidal. The conference started with a brief introduction and explanation of Tidal. After introducing the aforementioned sixteen artist co-owners of Tidal onstage, recording artist Alicia Keys spoke on behalf of the artists and for Tidal. She stated, \\"So we come together before you on this day, March 30th, 2015, with one voice in unity in the hopes that today will be another one of those moments in time, a moment that will forever change the course of music history.\\" Keys also described the event as like a \\"graduation\\". At the end of the press conference, all artists onstage signed a declaration, which stated Tidal's mission. Tidal claimed to have gained 100,000 new subscribers following the press conference revealing the artists involved in the service. In June 2015, Lil Wayne joined the service's roster as an artist co-owner, kicking off the partnership by exclusively releasing a track on the service called \\"Glory\\". On February 23, 2016, T.I. joined the service's roster as the latest co-owner, kicking off the partnership by releasing \\"Money Talk\\", a single from his tenth album, Dime Trap, exclusively on the service as well as the album was streamed live from Greenbriar Mall in Atlanta. On July 1, 2017, it was reported Kanye West left Tidal as co-owner and shareholder, after a financial argument with its board of directors regarding compensation for his contributions to the company. West later demanded a payment from Tidal of $3 million for his inclusion on marketing efforts, video production, and claiming the release of his 2016 album, The Life of Pablo, being the reason for Tidal's 1.5 million subscriber increase soon following the release. In response, Tidal stated West failed to deliver the videos he promised on his contract. Releases In April 2015, Tidal exclusives included Beyonc√© releasing a video of her performing \\"Die With You\\", a never-before heard original song, dedicated to her and Jay-Z's wedding anniversary, Madonna releasing a teaser of her upcoming music video at the time for \\"Ghosttown\\" and Rihanna debuting her brand new song and music video \\"American Oxygen\\". In January 2016, Tidal released Rihanna's Anti as a one- week exclusive stream. In February 2016, Tidal secured an exclusive initial release with Kanye West's The Life of Pablo. West went on to vow that the album would \\"never appear on any other services [than Tidal]\\", nor would it ever be for sale. On April 23, 2016, Beyonc√© released her second visual album, Lemonade, for streaming exclusively on Tidal. On April 25, it was made available for purchase by track or album on Amazon Music and the iTunes store and on May 6, it arrived at physical retailers. Jay Z's 2017 album 4:44 debuted on Tidal. The next year, Jay Z released a collaborative album with Beyonc√©, Everything Is Love, via Tidal. Livestreaming Tidal regularly streams concerts live and on demand including the Made in America festival and TIDAL X Brooklyn. In 2018, Tidal livestreamed Hot 97's 25th annual Summer Jam. Also in 2018, Tidal partnered with Equal Justice Initiative to live-stream The Concert for Peace and Justice. The concert commemorated the opening of The National Memorial for Peace and Justice and The Legacy Museum, both located in Montgomery, Alabama. Reception Shortly after Tidal's launch and press conference, the mobile version of the service shot to the top 20 of the U.S. iPhone Apps chart. Following criticism for its \\"out-of-touch marketing campaign\\", two weeks later, the app had already fallen out of the top 700 rankings of the same list. Praise Glenn Peoples of Billboard wrote that Tidal was a good thing for the music industry. He stated that the U.S. streaming market needed a \\"kick in the butt\\" when looking at the growth rate of streaming from 2014 to 2015. Peoples also noted that more competition in the streaming market is a good thing as it could lead to a \\"greater diffusion of innovation\\". He concluded that a service like Tidal ‚Äì which is promoted as paying a fair amount of royalties to both the artists and the songwriters ‚Äì will lead to the industry as a whole sorting out its issues with streaming royalties. Criticism Writing for USA Todays website, Micah Peters released a list of \\"3 reasons why Jay-Z's new Tidal streaming service is stupid\\". The article focused on points that the high fidelity, the lossless audio quality model being promoted was \\"overestimat[ing] the average listener\\". Peters worried that most listeners do not have the required, advanced headphones to distinguish the difference between ordinary and high fidelity audio. The article also stated that the $20 price was not reasonable for the mass market. Recording artist Lily Allen expressed her opinions on Tidal on her official Twitter account. She feared that the high price of Tidal, as well as the mass popularity of the artist co-owners, could result in crippling the music industry and increasing piracy. She stated \\"I love Jay-Z so much, but Tidal is (so) expensive compared to other perfectly good streaming services, he's taken the biggest artists‚Ä¶ Made them exclusive to Tidal (am I right in thinking this?), people are going to swarm back to pirate sites in droves\\". Jay-Z responded to criticism with a freestyle during the Tidal X: Ja√ø-Z B-Sides concert. He compares Tidal with Apple and Nike, and says that Tidal has been subjected to hypocritical criticism. Kanye West's decision to initially release his album The Life of Pablo as a Tidal streaming exclusive led to criticism from fans, who felt that streaming exclusivity could promote piracy. The album was pirated over 500,000 times as of February 17, 2016. West later made the album available to stream on competing services. In July 2017, West terminated his contract with Tidal, claiming that the service owed him $3 million. Finances and royalties One artist has stated that artist royalties per track from Aspiro/Tidal are currently over three times than those paid by Spotify, but that royalties may decrease to provide a sufficient return on investment. Jay-Z commented in an interview to Billboard that artists would be paid more by being streamed on Tidal than with Spotify, stating \\"Will artists make more money? Even if it means less profit for our bottom line? Absolutely.\\" In the same interview he also stressed the service was for people \\"lower down on the food chain\\". On February 27, 2016, Yesh Music, LLC and John Emanuele from the band The American Dollar launched a $5 million class-action lawsuit that claimed Tidal has yet to compensate the band for any of the royalty payments accrued from the streaming of the band's 116 copyrighted songs. The suit also accused Tidal of using faulty numbers to payout artists while also having undercut these same individuals by 35%. A response from Tidal has stated that they are indeed fully up to date on all royalties for the group and have removed said intellectual property from their servers. Controversy In January 2017, Norwegian newspaper Dagens N√¶ringsliv ('Today's Business') reported that it had received internal documents disclosing lower subscriber counts than had been publicly announced by Tidal and its owners, having only 350,000 users in September 2015 (contradicting a claim by Jay-Z that the service had a million users), and 850,000 subscribers by March 2016, rather than the 3 million claimed by the service (which may have been inflated by including users that were using a free trial). In May 2018, Dagens N√¶ringsliv published a report accusing Tidal of intentionally falsifying streaming numbers for Beyonc√©'s Lemonade and Kanye West's The Life of Pablo albums and consequently paying inflated royalties to the artists' record labels. The newspaper supported its report with a comprehensive study from Norwegian University of Science and Technology's Center for Cyber and Information Security in Gj√∏vik. Variety reported, the music service, which \\"has rarely shared its data publicly\\", being the exclusive streaming platform for both albums, \\"claimed that West‚Äôs album had been streamed 250 million times in its first 10 days of release in February of 2016, while claiming it had just 3 million subscribers ‚Äì a claim that would have meant every subscriber played the album an average of eight times per day; and that Beyonce‚Äôs album was streamed 306 million times in its first 15 days of release in April of 2016.\\" The company denied any wrongdoing. Following the allegations, Norwegian collection society TONO filed an official police complaint against Tidal. Danish music organization Koda has also announced that it would be conducting an independent audit of Tidal data. Model Platforms Tidal has apps available for Microsoft Windows, macOS, iOS and Android compatible devices. Tidal is compatible with Apple TV, Roku, CarPlay, Android TV, and Amazon Fire TV.

Frances Aviva Blane (born Frances Aviva Sternberg Hampstead, London)https://companycheck.co.uk/director/910930259/MRS-FRANCES- AVIVA-BLANE/summary is an English abstract painter who works in the Expressionist tradition. Her subject matter is the disintegration of paint and personality. Blane also draws. However, whereas her paintings are mainly non- referential, the drawings are often of heads, although, as in her paintings, the \\"heads\\" are deconstructed which echo her words \\"broken-up paint, broken-up heads\\". In 2014, her drawings were shown in an exhibition entitled Deconstruct at De Queeste Kunstkamers, Belgium. She has exhibited internationally in the UK, Europe, Australia and Japan. ‚ÄúThey are desperate paintings, fetching isolated and sombre emotion from the deep recesses ‚Äì they are 'primeval, before language, dredged from the back of your mind'. They are Beckett-like landscapes and express something like anxiety, unease, restlessness, all tinged with melancholy or plain sadness.‚Äù Dr Edward Winters, West Dean College, 2005, from the introduction in the catalogue for Frances Aviva Blane's show, Prime Time: Painting, Frances Aviva Blane ‚Äì paintings & drawings 2006 at Galerie Seitz & Partner, Berlin, January ‚Äì February 2006 ‚ÄúBlane‚Äôs drawings are not for the faint-hearted.

The district is focused on a cluster of four buildings on Station Road, northeast of the center of New Sweden, Maine. Notable among these is the c. 1888 Larsson-Ostlund House, which is the only known two-story log house built using Swedish construction techniques in the state. Across the street is the c. 1900 Noak Blacksmith Shop, a virtually unaltered building housing original equipment. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The Larsson‚ÄìNoak Historic District encompasses a rural agricultural landscape of in southeastern New Sweden. On the north side of Station Road stands the Lars Noak Blacksmith Shop, a single- story wood frame building with a gable roof. Oriented roughly north-south, with its side to the road, the shop has a double-leaf door in the southern gable end, with a sash window to its right. The eastern facade has six sash windows, and the north facade has a single-leaf door and three sash windows. The walls are finished in wooden shingles. The interior of the building houses a forge, anvil, and blacksmithing tools original to its c. 1900 construction. Across the street from the shop stands the Larsson-Ostlund House, a three- section structure whose oldest portion is a two-story log structure, finished in wooden clapboards. Extending to the north from this original block are two additions of wood frame construction. The main facade of the original block is three bays wide, with a center entry and five sash windows, all framed by simple trim. The walls are fashioned out of logs fitted using traditional Swedish dovetail joinery, and extend all the way up into the gables. No other houses in the state are known to extend log construction through two floors, or into the gable ends, which are usually framed with dimensional lumber. The first addition to the north has a two-story saltbox shape, with a secondary entrance and a porch extending across its width. The second addition is a simple single-story structure, with two sash windows flanking a wide vertical- board door. Other features of the district include a potato house, built c. 1928, which is a two-story gambrel-roofed wood-frame structure on a concrete foundation, and a single-bay garage, also a wood-frame structure, built about 1910. The foundational remains of the property's barn lie a short way to the north. New Sweden was settled by Swedish immigrants under a program initiated by the state in 1861 to draw migrants to northern Maine. By 1880 the \\"Swedish colony\\" was a thriving community with 163 households, and the program had drawn more than 1,000 immigrants to locations across the state. This property was settled by the Larsson family in 1870, who built the house and garage. In 1910 most of the land was bought by George Ostlund, who added the potato house. The blacksmith shop was built by Noak Larsson's son Lars Noak, on land given to him by his father.

After moving to England in 1881, aged 18, he went to Liverpool College for a few months and then in 1882 became a student at University College, Liverpool, where his academic brilliance became apparent, passing the matriculation exams for the University of London with honours. In 1887 he went to St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, to study medicine and was awarded a Gold Medal in obstetrics. In 1889 he continued his studies in Berlin under Wilhelm Krause; cellular pathologist Rudolf Virchow; and pioneering microbiologist and founder of modern bacteriology, Robert Koch, who received a Nobel Prize in 1905 for his groundbreaking research on tuberculosis. His studies in Germany demonstrated his accurate observation and original thought in the field of research. Career Returning from Berlin in 1890 he served as Obstetric Resident at St Bartholomew's Hospital Map by Alfredo Kanthack showing the increase and decrease of Leprosy in India since 1881. Wellcome L0039112 While holding this position he was appointed by the Royal College of Surgeons, Royal College of Physicians, and the Executive Committee of the National Leprosy Fund as one of the Special Commissioners to investigate the prevalence and treatment of leprosy in India. Among his conclusions were that direct contagion was at the most a very small factor in causing the spread of leprosy, and that compulsory segregation of lepers was not advisable. On his return from India in 1891 he matriculated at Cambridge as a Fellow Commoner of St John's College. At the same time he was appointed John Lucas Walker Student in Pathology, a scholarship given for original pathological research, under which he studied immunity. In 1892 he left Cambridge and began to practise as a physician in Liverpool. He was appointed Medical Tutor and Registrar at the Liverpool Royal Infirmary where he set up a Bacteriological Laboratory, Senior Demonstrator of Bacteriology in a post specially created for him, and also Medical Tutor at University College, Liverpool. St. Bartholomew's Hospital, 1896. Kanthack is standing in white coat. Wellcome Images In 1893 he returned to St Bartholomew's as Director of the Pathological Department in the Medical School and Hospital, Lecturer on Pathology and Bacteriology, and Curator of the Museum. In 1894 he suffered from a severe attack of typhoid fever, but in spite of this won the prestigious Royal College of Surgeons' Jacksonian Prize in 1895 for his essay The Aetiology of Tetanus and the Value of the Serum Treatment. In 1896 he acted as Deputy to Professor Charles Roy, who had been appointed to the new Chair in Pathology at Cambridge but was unable to take up the post due to ill- health. This required Kanthack to travel to and from St Bartholomew's and the University. In the spring of 1897 he moved to Cambridge where he was given an honorary MA and elected a Fellow of King's. In the autumn he succeeded Roy as Professor of Pathology at the age of 34. During the autumn of 1898 the report of his research on the tsetse fly, conducted by him in conjunction with Herbert Durham and Walter Blandford, was published. This report cleared the ground for further investigation of what was then known as tsetse-fly disease, although no method of prevention or cure was yet propounded His last work, in conjunction with Dr Sydney Sladen, reported on tuberculous milk. Shortly before his death he recommended one of his promising students, Walter Myers, for a John Lucas Walker scholarship. Kanthack is credited for the use of formalin as a histological fixative. Death He died of cancer on 21 December 1898 aged 35. After his funeral in Kings College Chapel, he was buried at Histon Road Cemetery, Cambridge. Legacy After his death his wife donated funds in his memory to establish a library in the Pathology Department which still bears his name, and a bronze memorial plaque was placed at the entrance in Tennis Court Road. A sum of money was collected after his death to establish The Kanthack Memorial Library in the Pathological Institute of St Bartholomew's Hospital. The Kanthack Medal has been awarded at Liverpool since 1900 for experimental pathology and microbiology, reflecting the importance of his work there.

The division was located within 16th Infantry Division (Egypt)'s bridgehead, as of October 13. Its units were positioned in the center and the north of the bridgehead. The 14th Brigade had been involved in the crossing and, along with the 1st Brigade, participated in the Egyptian offensive on October 14; as a result, it had lost half of its operational tank strength. In the aftermath, Orabi's efforts to reorganize and replace armored losses were hampered by frequent artillery barrages and air strikes. On October 15, there were 136 tanks in the Egyptian bridgehead, unevenly split among Oraby's brigades: 66 with the 1st Armored Brigade, 39 with the 14th Armoured Brigade, and 31 in the 18th Mechanized Brigade.

The island is recognised as one of the leading luxury private islands and conservation projects in East Africa and the Indian Ocean. Sophy Roberts of the Financial Times wrote (January 2009) 'Vamizi deserves to be the best eco-beach retreat on the planet. It's certainly the best sand I have ever seen'. History Vamizi Island, then called Amisa, was visited by Arab sailors during the 15th century. Portuguese traders were attracted to the island by its Maluane cloth industry. Other major industries in Vamizi included the production or collection of indigo, timber, ivory, manna gum and turtle shells. In September, 2020, Vamizi Island was captured by members of the ISIL-aligned Islamist militant group Ansar al-Sunna. All residents were evicted from the island and multiple tourist hotels were destroyed by the insurgents.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/09/20/jihadists-launch- assault-mozambiques-luxury-tourist-island/ The island was recaptured by Mozambican forces that same month.https://allafrica.com/stories/202009290847.html  Biodiversity and conservation  Vamizi is home to more than 180 different species of coral and more than 400 species of reef fish. Much of the island is protected, with several conservation projects in operation. The island's turtle population, previously exploited for turtle shells, is now protected. The Friends of Vamizi Trust is a UK registered charity that manages the conservation and community projects on the island.  Climate  Vamizi has a tropical climate. Economy Historically the main economy of the island has been fishing. In the early 1990s, a group of Europeans and Mozambicans investors and philanthropists started a conservation project on the island. In 1998 they set up the Cabo Delgado Biodiversity and Tourism project in collaboration with the Zoological Society of London. In those early days, the focus was to monitor and protect the turtles and to encourage the local people to fish sustainably. In 2006 the Vamizi Island Lodge, a sixteen-room small hotel, was opened by Nelson Mandela. Subsequently, Vamizi has established itself as one of the leading luxury island resorts in east Africa attracting guests including international scientific organisations and well-known celebrities interested in the remote beauty of the island and the activities on offer including scuba diving and fishing. The island has some of the best-unspoilt coral reefs anywhere including 'Neptune's Arm' which is considered to be one of the world's top ten dive sites. In 2010 the first private villa was completed and now there are six large private villas on the island. Construction projects on the island - roads, airstrip, staff housing and the private villas have created a large number of jobs and developed skills amongst the local population.

Biography He was born in the village of Halepa, near Chania, in 1791. He acquired great education and was able to speak two foreign languages fluently (French and Italian). In 1814 he went to Instanbul in order to work as a secretary. There he became a member of the Filiki Eteria. Because of his revolutionary actions, he had to flee from Instanbul to Odessa, hunted by the Turks. From there, through Vienna and Trieste, he came to the Peloponnese right before the outburst of the Greek War of Independence. In 1822, in Crete, alongside Joseph Valest, he faced-off against a Turko-Egyptian army of 10.000 men right outside the village of Malaksa, where they acquired a victory of great importance. When Ibrahim set foot on the Peloponnese with his Turko- Egyptian army, Emmanouil gathered an army of Cretans and, outside the village of Mili, near Nafplio, beat them in battle, making them fall back to the city of Tripoli. He took part as an attorney of Crete in both the second and the third National Assemblies of Greece (the first in 1823 and the second in 1827). After the battle of Malaksa in 1825, he joined the Greek parliament. He was one of the first journalists in Greece and also an editor for the newspaper Athena (ŒëŒ∏Œ∑ŒΩŒ¨). He died in Athens.

Gameplay  The game is designed to be played with at least two players, with one player as the \\"Defuser\\", playing the game on a device (supporting both keyboard and mouse, touchscreen and gamepad controls, as well as support for virtual reality headsets), and the remaining players as the \\"Experts\\" reading the provided bomb defusal manual. As designed, the Defuser cannot look at the manual and must rely on the Experts to instruct them; similarly, the Experts cannot see the bomb, and must rely on the Defuser to describe the bomb to them. The Experts and the Defuser can communicate with each other either directly from across a table, or online using a separate voice service. Each bomb in the game consists of multiple modules; the modules are independent of each other and can be disarmed in any order. Most modules require disarming, with the bomb successfully disarmed when all such modules are successfully disarmed. Disarming these modules requires the Defuser to relay visual indicators to the Experts, who then use the manual to determine what actions the Defuser to take. Other modules are \\"needy\\": they cannot be disarmed, and demand periodic attention to prevent them from causing a strike while the bomb is still armed. Each bomb will also have a countdown timer; if the timer reaches zero, the bomb will explode. Bombs will also have a maximum number of strikes resulting from errors made during defusing (also speeding the timer), and if that maximum is reached, the bomb will also explode. Other obstacles to the Defuser include the lights in the virtual room going out momentarily, and alarm clocks that will distract the Defuser. Modules use complex instruction sets and puzzle-like elements to be solved, and the defusing instructions are generally conditional on the configuration of the particular module; for example, the Experts may need to guide the Defuser through a maze whose walls the Defuser cannot see, but as the manual has maps for a number of mazes, the Defuser must help the Expert identify which map is currently applicable for that given module. Some modules deliberately make verbal communication complicated: some use unusual glyphs that require description, other modules use words that may be homophones of other similar words (\\"sees\\" to \\"seas\\"), verbal tics (\\"uhhh\\" or \\"uh huh\\") or common words that would be otherwise used in that situation (\\"press\\" or \\"left\\") that could easily be confused during communication between Defuser and Experts. Many modules have multiple stages that require the Experts to keep track of past actions as they work through each stage. Defusing some modules may also depend on the state of the bomb such as how many strikes it presently has, or external decorations on the bomb like the serial number or the presence of batteries. The game is broken up into a number of predetermined levels broken up into skill groupings that set the number and types of modules, the time to defuse the bomb, and the maximum number of strikes. Each level will generate the bomb and its modules to be defused in a procedural manner. Players also can create a custom challenge based on module count, time, and strikes.  Development  Developers Allen Pestaluky, Ben Kane, and Brian Fetter originally created the game for Global Game Jam 2014. There, they had a few Oculus Rift development kits and wanted to take advantage of the novelty of virtual reality. Their original game, a rollercoaster ride simulator, had attracted a number of people to try it out, but the three observed that while the wearer of the headset was enjoying themselves, those waiting for their turn did not share that enjoyment. This gave them the idea of a game that could be shared alike by both a headset wearer and those watching the wearer. Though they had several scenarios in mind, the idea of bomb defusing was the most interesting as well as something they could complete during the Game Jam. At the end of the Game Jam, they presented their game to the other participating developers, recording their own first playthrough of the game which they later posted to YouTube; the response both at the Game Jam and from YouTube viewers, calling the game \\"hilarious\\", led the three to realize they were on to a marketable title and developed the game for a full release. In developing the various rules for disarming modules, these were initially created procedurally like the bombs themselves, so that they could be shifted around between various demonstrates at trade shows; though the final game has statically defined rules for defusing, there is a framework in place that can be used to mix up the rules in future versions. A PlayStation VR version of the game was released on 13 October 2016, while a version for the Android- based Google Daydream virtual reality platform was released on 10 November 2016. Steel Crate released a non-VR version for the PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox One on 16 August 2018; this was a free update for existing owners of the game. Ports for iOS and Android devices without VR support were released on 1 August 2019.  Reception  The PC version of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews while the PlayStation 4 version received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", according to review aggregator Metacritic. Destructoid awarded it a score of 9 out of 10, saying \\"If you are tired of always playing Cards Against Humanity, Monopoly, and that Gargoyles board game on Laserdisc, then Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes will certainly give you the fix you're looking for, pending you have friends ready to be committed to the task at hand.\\" Ars Technica Sam Machkovech reviewed the game, calling it a \\"must-have\\", although he also noted that once players figure out certain modules, they can \\"hit a chore-like rhythm\\" instead of a challenge. He also observed the game's potential as a party game that is equally enjoyable for onlookers. At the 2015 National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers (NAVGTR) awards Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes won Game, Strategy. The game also won the Excellence in Design award, and was nominated for the Seumas McNally Grand Prize and the Nuovo (Innovation) Award at the 2016 Independent Games Festival. Steel Crate Games was nominated for the Best Debut for the game for the 2016 Game Developers Choice Awards, and the 2016 British Academy Games Awards. The Official UK PlayStation Magazine listed it as the third best PS VR game.PS VR Hall of Fame, Official UK PlayStation Magazine, Issue 136, June 2017, Future Publishing, page 108 By March 2016, the game had sold more than 200,000 copies.

It has a wide Indo-Pacific distribution. They are produced through aquaculture and commercially fished. Description Epinephelus undulosus has a standard length which is 2.7 to 3.1 times its depth. It has a convex region between the eyes. The preopecle is angular with an incision just above its angle and there are enlarged serrations at the angle while the gill cover has a straight or slightly concave upper margin. There are 11 spines and 17-19 soft rays in the dorsal fin and 3 spines and 8 rays in the anal fin. The membranes between the dorsal fin spines are not notched. The caudal fin is truncate or emarginate. The ovell colour of the head, body, and fins purplish grey to brownish grey, marked with brown to golden-brown spots on the head and wavy horizontal brown or golden brown lines on the upper body, although these may be indistinct on larger fish. The margin of the spiny part of the dorsal fin has a thin line of blackish colouration. This species attains a total length of , although they are more commonly around , and a maximum weight of . Distribution Epinephelus undulosus is found in the Indian and Pacific Oceans from the coasts of Somalia and Kenya, the Gulf of Aden and Socotra east to southern India and Sri Lanka and on to the Pacific Ocean where it extends to the Solomon Islands in the east and Taiwan ion the north. This species has not been recorded from the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf or Australia. Habitat and ecology Epinephelus undulosus is found on open muddy seabeds, where it hides in holes in the mud or within solid structures, shipwrecks or debris. It is also found in banks. The adults live at depths from around while juveniles may be found in water as shallow as on coral reefs. It is a generalist predator preying on a variety of benthic fishes and crustaceans it will also take macrozooplankton, such as pelagic tunicates of the genera Thalia and Pyrosoma, if available. Taxonomy Epinephelus undulosus was first formally described as Bodianus undulosus in 1824 by the French naval surgeons and naturalists Jean Ren√© Constant Quoy (1790-1869) and Joseph Paul Gaimard (1793-1858) with the type locality given as Waigeo in West Papua.

Background Aged 17, Hallam had been sentenced to serve a minimum of 12 years in prison for the murder of a trainee chef, Essayas Kassahun, during a street brawl in Old Street. Two witnesses claimed to have seen him at the scene, but their evidence was unreliable, with one witness attempting to go back on his statement in court, and another saying, \\"I just wanted someone to blame on the spot, really.\\" No other evidence, forensic or otherwise, existed to link him to the scene, and Hallam always maintained he was not there, although he had no alibi to prove it. The campaign Friends and family of Hallam asked veteran human-rights campaigner Paul May to set up a campaign to prove his innocence. May mounted a legal appeal for Hallam and arranged numerous events and media interviews to publicise the case. Actor Ray Winstone presented a TV documentary which was screened in 2010 which outlined the flaws in the case against Hallam Playwright Tess Berry-Hart created a verbatim theatre play Someone To Blame as part of the campaign to raise awareness of the case. The play used verbatim court transcripts, witness testimony and first-person interviews from the original case and ran at the King's Head Theatre Islington in February 2012. First appeal In 2007 there was a failed appeal with the judges holding that the evidence of the witnesses could still be relied upon. The case was then referred to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which spent three years examining his case. Thames Valley Police was instructed on their behalf to examine the original Metropolitan Police investigation. Based on their findings, the case was sent back to the Court of Appeal. Second appeal In May 2012 after only three hours hearing, the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to defend the conviction, and the three judges led by Lady Justice Hallett granted temporary bail. Hallam walked out the front doors of the Court of Appeal and was drenched in champagne. The next day, Hallam attended court with his mother Wendy Cohen to hear his murder conviction formally overturned. After Sam's release, Someone To Blame was updated for a weekend run at the King's Head to celebrate his freedom. Sadly, Hallam's father and grandmother had both died whilst he was imprisoned. Later events Hallam launched a legal challenge in January 2015 challenging the law that prevents him from receiving compensation for the years he wrongly spent in prison.

The AMEDD Regimental Insignia (derived from the coat of arms) in its new (2014) revised version. The regimental coat of arms of the Army Medical Department of the United States Army‚Äîknown as the AMEDD‚Äîis an heraldic emblem dating back, with slight variations, to about 1863. Since 1986, it has formed the basis of the AMEDD's distinctive unit insignia: the emblem worn by all AMEDD soldiers on their service uniforms. Description and history The Medical Department regimental coat of arms was devised at the direction of Army Surgeon General William Alexander Hammond around 1863 and is one of the Army's oldest regimental emblems. Its iconography and design harkened back to 1818, which is the year Congress created a permanent Army \\"Medical Department\\", as opposed to the ad hoc organizations that had existed before. The 20 white stars on a blue background and the red and white stripes represent the U.S. flag of 1818. The green staff entwined with a green serpent combined two symbols: the Rod of Aesculapius from classical mythology, symbolic of medicine and healing; and the color green associated with US Army regular physicians during the last half of the 19th century. The colors Argent (silver/white) and Gules (red) are those associated with the flag of the United States. The rooster is also associated with Asclepius/Aesculapius, the ancient Greek and Roman god of healing and medicine. The ancient Greeks believed that the rooster's crowing at dawn drove away the evil disease spreading demons from the temples so that it could be a place of healing. (The rooster had a strong connection with medicine in classical times. A practice at the time was to pay for medical services with poultry. On May 7, 399 B.C., Socrates died of judicially mandated poisoning by drinking hemlock. His last recorded words were said to be \\"I owe a cock to Aesculapius, see that it is paid.\\") The torse (twisted rope) below the rooster shows alternating blue and silver colors which were the colors of the Army in 1818. The Latin motto Experientia et Progressus (\\"Experience and Progress\\") is meant to convey the steady and unfailing progress of the Army Medical Department since its original incarnation as the \\"Army Hospital\\" in July 1775. AMEDD Regimental Distinctive Insignia The U.S. Army Medical Department Regimental Flag incorporates all elements of the AMEDD CoA. The AMEDD's Regimental Distinctive Insignia is worn by US Army soldiers affiliated with the Army Medical Department (AMEDD). In 1986 the Army established the Regimental Affiliation Program. Combat Service Support (now Sustainment) soldiers were affiliated with their newly established regiments and regimental distinctive insignia were created to represent those regiments. The AMEDD Regimental Distinctive Insignia incorporated the shield from the AMEDD regimental coat of arms and the motto (\\"To Conserve Fighting Strength\\") of the Medical Field Service School's (established 1920) distinctive unit insignia. The AMEDD Regimental Distinctive Insignia is one of the Army's 14 regimental corps insignias. These insignias are worn over the right breast pocket on the Army Service Uniform (ASU) and signify the service member's branch of service. The current design of the AMEDD regimental distinctive insignia was approved on 27 October 2014. Variations Image:AMEDDRegIns1986.jpgThe AMEDD RDI, 1986 version.

History  Harwood Manufacturing is a family textile company which became the site for a number of experiments in the behavioral sciences and workplace innovation, beginning in the late 1930s and extending over the next four decades. Shortly after Harwood Manufacturing had moved its operations from New England to Virginia the newly opened factory started to experience difficulties with recruiting skilled workers. As a result of the moving the company had to train 300 inexperienced people from the Virginia mountains- to meet the high production standards of the industrialized areas of the North America. Despite the fact that inexperienced trainees (who were mainly woman) were eager to work, on the job their pace was slow, their output was too low and the turnover was enormously high. After twelve weeks of training, the new employees produced only half as much as apprentices who were doing similar task in Northern US factories. Constant changes in methods and jobs, which were considered necessary in order to beat a highly intense competition, were frequently resulting in low productivity, aggressive behavior towards management, a drop in output and absenteeism. In 1939 Kurt Lewin was invited by Alfred Marrow, the managing director of the factory, to discuss significant problems of labor with the staff of the Harwood Manufacturing Corporation. The Harwood study is considered the first experiment of group decision making and self-management in industry and the first example of applied organizational psychology. The Harwood Experiment was part of Lewin's continuing exploration of participatory action research. The Harwood studies can be divided into three time frames: the Lewin years, 1939 to 1947; the post-Lewin years, 1947 to 1962; and the Weldon years (after Harwood took over the Weldon Manufacturing Corporation), 1962 onward. By the opinion of Alfred Marrow, the owner of the factory and the later biographer of Kurt Lewin, the key experiments that were done on the factory were concerning group behavior, self-management, leadership training, changing stereotypes and overcoming resistance to change.  Harwood experiments   Introduction  The very first problem Kurt Lewin was trying to solve was employee turnover. The factory saw the core problem in employees‚Äô lack of experience, however Kurt Lewin argued that the constant pressure and the way workers were treated could be a more important reason for people quitting their jobs. Lewin came up with several possible solutions to such a problem. The main idea was to draw supervisors‚Äô attention to the way they treat their subordinates ‚Äî to exclude the pressure and instead to find a way to make them believe that all the standards and goals are achievable. Also he highlighted that it is essential to deal with workers as members of small groups rather than as individuals. These changes began to bring about improvements in terms of employee retention, but there were still many other issues the plant needed to deal with. Lewin suggested that the company should employ its own full-time psychologist and start its own program of research. Throughout the period of 1939‚Äì1962 years several psychologists were assisting Lewin or, after his death, conducting their own experiments. The first psychologist who was employed by the factory was Alex Bavelas. When he returned to his studies, he was replaced by John R. P. French Jr. who was later joined by Lester Coch. The study began with Bavelas who was asked to plan and carry out a series of group experiments on human factors in factory management within the domain of action research in industry.  Group decision  The first experiment aimed to analyze the effect of giving workers a chance to take part in setting their own goals and control their output. Bavelas selected a group of the productive factory workers with whom he met several times a week. Those meetings were informal 30-minute gatherings where each group member was encouraged to discuss the difficulties he or she might encounter if the group wanted to increase its daily production. All together they were discussing each operator‚Äôs working method and analyzing advantages and disadvantages of such approach. In so doing, it became clear that workers often use different methods while doing the same task. They also identified changes that the company‚Äôs management would need to make to improve productivity. Management agreed to help carry through the changes that were recommended. At the end of each meeting the group would vote on whether to increase their daily output, to what level, and over what period of time. As a result, they voted to enhance output from 75 units per hour to 87 over a period of 5 days. After reaching this figure, they then agreed to increase the rate to 90. Throughout the next five months the group managed to maintain a significant growth that was reached by the end of those meetings. No other group in the factory was capable of achieving the same results. Lewin concluded that the democratic way of decision making process was the key solution for productivity growth. However, in order to check that, Bavelas set up meetings with two other groups of operators. In both cases, the groups only discussed increasing productivity without further voting. The result was that only a slight improvement in their productivity occurred.  Self-management  The second experiment was aimed to discover the influence of self-management on the level of productivity. To test this opinion, Baveals let workers decide themselves the level of output without strong control from the management side. He had a small group of workers plan their own hourly pace and daily work level as long as they kept at or above the obligatory minimum quota. The planning of the pace was made with the use of \\"pacing cards\\". These workers were on piece work, and therefore, the more they produced above the minimum quota the greater was their pay. Bavelas also established a control group whose work arrangements were not changed. The level of production of the control group didn‚Äôt change, whereas the output of the experimental group grew from 67 units per hour to 82 units. Lewin concluded the main cause of such a positive result was lowering the pressure from managerial side toward workers. Although those two experiments proved the importance of employee involvement to the decision making at work, John R. P. French argued that it has to go hand in hand with the style of personal leadership. Therefore, French introduced the idea of changing the style of management personal leadership in order to modify the forces that influence work group behavior.  Leadership training  Bavelas‚Äô series of experiments showed that the autocratic approach to management does not result in increased efficiency of workers. That is why a change in leadership style is another thing that was considered important to achieve in the Harwood Manufacturing. The idea of this training was to give the necessary knowledge to supervisors concerning cooperation, morale, disciplinary problems and trust. Relying to the Lippitt-White study of authoritarian and democratic leadership styles, Lewin came up with the idea of Leadership training for all the levels of supervisory management. The methods that were used the most were role playing, socio-drama, self-examination, feedback-sessions, group problem solving, and other action research techniques. During the meetings participants were asked about all the problems they encounter on daily basis at work. Later on those problems were discussed, various other scenarios were enacted, and between meetings the participants would try out different approaches to the problems they faced, and the results of these would be analyzed in the following training session. Shortly after fifth meeting, participants had found a way to effectively develop their interpersonal skills. The majority of them stated that it became easier to communicate and deal with their superiors as well as with their peers. The skills in getting the cooperation of subordinates had significantly improved, as had their subordinates‚Äô productivity.  Changing stereotypes  Like many companies at those times Harwood Manufacturing had a policy of not recruiting women after their thirties. But because of the war they were finding it harder and harder to employ young female workers. The only way to solve this problem was to start hiring older employees. However this idea was not supported by management of all levels; they strongly believed that older employees would have difficulties meeting the factory‚Äôs requirements compared to the younger females. French suggested to assess the value to the company of each worker as follows: productivity, speed of learning new jobs, sickness/absence, and turnover rate. After collecting the data it turned out that older workers were outperforming the younger ones. French and Marrow found that providing facts to management did not influence their opinion, but when top management was involved in research, so that the facts would be top management‚Äôs own discovery, attitudes changed and with the time superior workers started to accept the idea of recruiting older employees.  Overcoming resistance to change  The experiment on overcoming resistance to change stemmed from the problem of employees‚Äô reluctance to changes. Workers were not satisfied with the job transfers. They had to constantly leave tasks at which they had just developed proficiency. As a result, the company was encountering lower output, grievances, and increased labor turnover. The more difficult the new job, the greater was the degree of frustration. That is why Coch and French established four experimental groups. In this research they were trying to address the two main questions: * Why do people resist change so strongly? * What can be done to overcome this resistance? The first group was a control group. The new changes at work were announced to them in a usual manner and they were given a chance to ask questions. The second group was given more precise information about changes and was allowed to elect representatives who would participate in planning and setting the new production rates. Members of groups 3 and 4 were entirely involved in the discussion process with management about all aspects of the change. They could make a number of recommendations and help to plan the most efficient methods for doing the new job. The result of the experiment was that the level of productivity and the amount of aggression expressed against management varied inversely with the degree of participation in the changes. Average production in the first group dropped 20 per cent and did not regain the pre-change level. The group which participated through representatives required two weeks to recover its pre-change output and, finally, groups 3 and 4 reached an increase of about 15% of the output their prechange productivity levels. Coch and French‚Äôs examination have indicated that behavior of employees can be influenced by their direct participation and involvement.  Implication and criticism  These studies became a part of the Harwood working process for more than 30 years. The results of experiments were used to bring understanding to group behavior and identify change options for companies. They helped to create many of the tools and techniques used in organization development. In terms of criticism, there are several issues concerning the experiments which were discussed the most. Clem Adelman highlighted that Lewin did not draw attention to power relations issue between superior workers and their subordinates. In the series of experiments in Harwood Manufacturing, Lewin automatically assumed that goals of management were rational and unquestionable. Mel Van Elteren (referring to the earlier work of Graebner) speculated on the question of whether the Lewin‚Äôs studies were exclusively democratic and did they contain the manipulative element. In each case in Harwood experiments, predetermined goals had already been set by management which cannot be interpreted as a fundamentally democratic approach. The \\"overcoming resistance to change\\" experiment performed Coch and French has been criticized over the years, mostly in relation to the management and methodology of their research. When the psychologists started this experiment, they had been already working in the factory for several years and moreover employees were predisposed to respond well to the participative approach. Many critics claimed that the study in Harwood was an atypical case due to the fact that the owner of the factory was a certified psychologist who had a full interest and curiosity in conducting experiments in the factory.

It also allows to obtain whole gene expression profiling of complex microbial communities. While metagenomics focuses on studying the genomic content and on identifying which microbes are present within a community, metatranscriptomics can be used to study the diversity of the active genes within such community, to quantify their expression levels and to monitor how these levels change in different conditions (e.g., physiological vs. pathological conditions in an organism). The advantage of metatranscriptomics is that it can provide information about differences in the active functions of microbial communities which appear to be the same in terms of microbe composition.  Introduction  The microbiome has been defined as a microbial community occupying a well-defined habitat. They are ubiquitous and extremely relevant for the maintenance of‚Äù the characteristic of the environment in which they reside and an imbalance in these communities can affect negatively the activity of the setting in which they reside. To study these communities, and to then determine their impact and correlation with their niche, different omics- approaches have been used. While metagenomics allows to obtain a taxonomic profile of the sample, metatrascriptomics provides a functional profile by analysing which genes are expressed by the community. It is possible to infer what genes are expressed under specific conditions, and this can be done using functional annotations of expressed genes.  Function  Since metatranscriptomics focuses on what genes are expressed, it allows to understand the active functional profile of the entire microbial community. The overview of the gene expression in a given sample is obtained by capturing the total mRNA of the microbiome and by performing a whole metatranscriptomics shotgun sequencing.  Tools and techniques  Although microarrays can be exploited to determine the gene expression profiles of some model organisms, next-generation sequencing and third-generation sequencing are the preferred techniques in metatranscriptomics. The protocol that is used to perform a metatranscriptome analysis may vary depending on the type of sample that needs to be analysed. Indeed, many different protocols have been developed for studying the metatranscriptome of microbial samples. Generally, the steps include sample harvesting, RNA extraction (different extraction methods for different kinds of samples have been reported in the literature), mRNA enrichment, cDNA synthesis and preparation of metatranscriptomic libraries, sequencing and data processing and analysis. mRNA enrichment is one of the trickiest parts. Different strategies have been proposed: * removing rRNA through Ribosomal RNA capture * using a 5-3 exonuclease to degrade processed RNAs (mostly rRNA and tRNA) * adding poly(A) to mRNAs by using a polyA polymerase (in E. coli) * using antibodies to capture mRNAs that bind to specific proteins The last two strategies are not recommended as they have been reported to be highly biased.  Computational analysis  A typical metatranscriptome analysis pipeline: *maps reads to a reference genome or *performs de novo assembly of the reads into transcript contigs and supercontigs The first strategy maps reads to reference genomes in databases, to collect information that is useful to deduce the relative expression of the single genes. Metatranscriptomic reads are mapped against databases using alignment tools, such as Bowtie2, BWA, and BLAST. Then, the results are annotated using resources, such as GO, KEGG, COG, and Swiss-Prot. The final analysis of the results is carried out depending on the aim of the study. One of the latest metatranscriptomics techniques is stable isotope probing (SIP), which has been used to retrieve specific targeted transcriptomes of aerobic microbes in lake sediment. The limitation of this strategy is its reliance on the information of reference genomes in databases. The second strategy retrieves the abundance in the expression of the different genes by assembling metatranscriptomic reads into longer fragments called contigs using different softwares. So, its limits depend on the software that is used for the assembly. The Trinity software for RNA-seq, in comparison with other de novo transcriptome assemblers, was reported to recover more full-length transcripts over a broad range of expression levels, with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments. This is particularly important in the absence of a reference genome. A quantitative pipeline for transcriptomic analysis was developed by Li and Dewey and called RSEM (RNA-Seq by Expectation Maximization). It can work as stand-alone software or as a plug-in for Trinity. RSEM starts with a reference transcriptome or assembly along with RNA-Seq reads generated from the sample and calculates normalized transcript abundance (meaning the number of RNA-Seq reads cor-responding to each reference transcriptome or assembly). Although both Trinity and RSEM were designed for transcriptomic datasets (i.e., obtained from a single organism), it may be possible to apply them to metatranscriptomic data (i.e., obtained from a whole microbial community). Bioinformatics Given the huge amount of data obtained from metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis, the use of bioinformatic tools have become of greater importance in the last decades. In order to achieve so, many different bioinformatic pipelines have been developed, often as open source platforms, such as HUMAnN and the most recent HUMAnN2, MetaTrans, SAMSA, Leimena-2013 and mOTUs2. HUMAnN2 HUMAnN2 is a bioinformatic pipeline designed from the latter HUMAnN developed during the Human Microbiome Project (HMP), implementing a ‚Äútiered search‚Äù approach. In the first tier, HUMAnN2 screens DNA or RNA reads with MetaPhlAn2 in order to identify already known microbes and constructing a sample-specific database by merging pangenomes of annotated species; in the second tier the algorithm performs a mapping of the reads against the assembled pangenome database; in the third tier, non-aligned reads are used for a translated search against a protein database. MetaTrans MetaTrans is a pipeline that exploits multi-threading computers to improve metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis. Data is obtained from paired-end RNA-Seq, mainly from 16S RNA for taxonomy and mRNA for gene expression levels. The pipeline is divided in 4 major steps. Firstly, paired-end reads are filtered for quality control purposes, to be thereafter sorted for taxonomic analysis (by removal of tRNA sequences) or functional analysis (by removal of both tRNA and rRNA sequencing). For the taxonomic analysis, sequences are mapped against 16S rRNA Greengenes v13.5 database using SOAP2, while for functional analysis sequences are mapped against a functional database such as MetaHIT-2014 always by using SOAP2 tool. This pipeline is highly flexible, since it offers the possibility to use third-party tools and improve single modules as long as the general structure is preserved. SAMSA This pipeline is designed specifically for metatranscriptomics data analysis, by working in conjunction with the MG-RAST server for metagenomics. This pipeline is simple to use, requires low technical preparation and computational power and can be applied to a wide range of microbes. The algorithm is divided in 4 steps. At first, sequences from raw sequencing data are selected on quality basis and are then submitted to MG-RAST (which foresee different steps such as quality control check, gene calling, clustering of amino acid sequences and use of sBLAT on each cluster to detect the best matches). Matches are then aggregated for taxonomic and functional analysis purposes, that usually follow up as last steps of the process. Leimena-2013 This pipeline actually does not have a name so that it is usually reckoned with the first name of the author of the article in which it is described. This algorithm foresees the implementation of alignment tools such as BLAST and MegaBLAST. Reads, usually obtained by Illumina sequencing, are clustered in identical-reads clusters and are then processed for in-silico removal of t-RNA and r-RNA sequences. Remaining reads are then mapped on NCBI databases by using BLAST and MegaBLAST tools and classified by their bitscore. Higher bitscore sequences are thereby interpreted to predict phylogenetic origin and function. Lower score reads instead are aligned with BLASTX (higher sensitivity) and eventually can be aligned in protein databases so that their function can be characterized. mOTUs2 The mOTUs2 profiler, which is based on essential housekeeping genes, is demonstrably well-suited for quantification of basal transcriptional activity of microbial community members. Depending on environmental conditions, the number of transcripts per cell varies for most genes. An exception to this are housekeeping genes that are expressed constitutively and with low variability under different conditions. Thus, the abundance of transcripts from such genes strongly correlate with the abundance of active cells in a community.  Microarray  Another method that can be exploited for metatranscriptomic purposes is Tiling Microarrays. In particular, microarrays have been used to measure microbial transcription levels, to detect new transcripts and to obtain information about the structure of mRNAs (for instance, the UTR boundaries). Recently, it has also been used to find new regulatory ncRNA. However, microarrays are affected by some pitfalls: *requirement of probe design *low sensitivity *prior knowledge of gene targets. RNA-Seq can overcome these limitations: it does not require any previous knowledge about the genomes that have to be analysed and it provides high throughput validation of genes prediction, structure, expression. Thus, by combining the two approaches it is possible to have a more complete representation of bacterial transcriptome. Limits of the metatranscriptomic techniques *With its dominating abundance, ribosomal RNA strongly reduces the coverage of mRNA (main focus of transcriptomic studies) in the total collected RNA. *Extraction of high-quality RNA from some biological or environmental samples (such as feces) can be difficult * Instability of mRNA that compromises sample integrity even before sequencing. *Experimental issues can affect the quantification of differences in expression among multiple samples: They can influence integrity and input RNA, as well as the amount of rRNA remaining in the samples, size section and gene models. Moreover, molecular base techniques are very prone to artefacts. *Difficulties in differentiating between host and microbial RNA, although commercial kits for the microbial enrichment are available. This may also be done in silico if a reference genome is available for the host. *Transcriptome reference databases are limited in their coverage. *Generally, large populations of cells are exploited in metatranscriptomic analysis, so it is difficult to resolve important variances that can exist between subpopulations. Actually, high variability in pathogen populations was demonstrated to affect disease progression and virulence. *Both for microarray and RNA-Seq, it is difficult to set a real ‚Äúcut off‚Äù in order to consider the genes as ‚Äúexpress‚Äù, due to the high dynamic range in gene expression. *The presence of mRNA is not always associated with the actual presence of the respective protein. Metatrascriptomics and Gut Microbiome The gut microbiome has emerged in recent years as an important player in human health. Its prevalent functions are related to the fermentation of indigestible food components, competitions with pathogen, strengthening of the intestinal barrier, stimulation and regulation of the immune system. Although much has been learnt about the microbiome community in the last years, the wide diversity of microorganisms and molecules in the gut requires new tools to enable new discoveries. By focusing on the changes in the expression of the genes, metatrascriptomics allows to take a more dynamic picture of the state and activity of the microbiome than metagenomics. It has been observed that metatranscriptomic functional profiles are more variable than what might have been reckoned only by metagenomic information. This suggests that non-housekeeping genes are not stably expressed in situ One example of metatranscriptomic application is in the study of the gut microbiome in inflammatory bowel disease. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic diseases of the digestive tract that affects millions of people worldwide. Several human genetic mutations have been linked to an increased susceptibility to IBD, but additional factors are needed for the full development of the disease. Regarding the relationship between IBD and gut microbiome, it is known that there is a dysbiosis in patients with IBD but microbial taxonomic profiles can be highly different among patients, making it difficult to implicate specific microbial species or strains in disease onset and progression. In addition, the gut microbiome composition presents a high variability over time among people, with more pronounced variations in patient with IBD. The functional potential of an organism, meaning the genes and pathways encoded in its genome, provides only indirect information about the level or extent of activation of such functions. So, the measurement of functional activity (gene expression) is critical to understand the mechanism of the gut microbiome dysbiosis. Alterations in transcriptional activity in IBD, established on the rRNA expression, indicate that some bacterial populations are active in patients with IBD, while other groups are inactive or latent. A metatranscriptomics analysis measuring the functional activity of the gut microbiome reveals insights only partially observable in metagenomic functional potential, including disease-linked observations for IBD. It has been reported that many IBD-specific signals are either more pronounced or only detectable on the RNA level. These altered expression profiles are potentially the result of changes in the gut environment in patients with IBD, which include increased levels of inflammation, higher concentrations of oxygen and a diminished mucous layer. Metatranscriptomics has the advantage of allowing to skip the assaying of biochemical products in situ (like mucus or oxygen) and allows to study the effects of environmental changes on microbial expression patterns in vivo for large human populations. In addition, it can be coupled with longitudinal sampling to associate modulation of activity with the disease progression. Indeed, it has been shown that while a particular path may remain stable over time at the genomic level, the corresponding expression varies with the disease severity. This suggests that microbial dysbiosis affect the gut health through changing in the transcriptional programmes in a stable community. In this way, metatracriptomic profiling emerges as an important tool for understanding the mechanisms of that relationship. Some technical limitations of the RNA measurements in stool are related to the fact that the extracted RNA can be degraded and, if not, it still represents only the organisms presents in the stool sample. Other applications of metagenomics: *Directed culturing: it was used to understand nutritional preferences of organisms in order to allow the preparation of a proper culture medium, resulting in a successful isolation of microbes in vitro. *Identify potential virulence factors: through comparative transcriptomics, in order to compare different transcriptional responses of related strains or species after specific stimuli. *Identify host-specific biological processes and interactions For this purpose, it‚Äôs important to develop new technologies which allow the detection, at the same time, of changes in the expression levels of some genes. Examples of techniques applied: Microarrays: allow the monitoring of changes in the expression levels of many genes in parallel for both host and pathogen. First microarray approaches have shown the first global analysis of gene expression changes in pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae, Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Salmonella enterica, revealing the strategies that are used by these microorganisms to adapt to the host. In addition, microarrays only provide the first global insights about the host innate immune response to PAMPs, as the effects of bacterial infection on the expression of various host factor. Anyway, the detection through microarrays of both organisms at the same time could be problematic. Problems: *Probe selection (hundreds of millions of different probes) *Cross-hybridization *Need of expensive chips (with the proper design; high-density arrays) *Require the pathogen and host cells to be physically separated before gene expression analysis (eukaryotic cells‚Äô transcriptomes are larger in comparison to the pathogens‚Äô ones, so could happen that the signal from pathogens‚Äô RNAs is hidden). *Loss of RNA molecules during the eukaryotic cells lysis. Dual RNA-Seq: this technique allows the simultaneous study of both host and pathogen transcriptomes as well. It is possible to monitor the expression of genes at different time points of the infection process; in this way could it be possible to study the changes in cellular networks in both organisms starting from the initial contact until the manipulation of the host (interplay host-patogen). *Potential: No need of expensive chips *Probe-independent approach (RNA-seq provides transcript information without prior knowledge of mRNA sequences) *High sensitivity. *Possibility of studying the expression levels of even unknown genes under different conditions Moreover, RNA-Seq is an important approach for identifying coregulated genes, enabling the organization of pathogen genomes into operons. Indeed, genome annotation has been done for some eukaryotic pathogens, such as Candida albicans, Trypanosoma brucei and Plasmodium falciparum. Despite the increasing sensitivity and depth of sequencing now available, there are still few published RNA-Seq studies concerning the response of the mammalian host cell to the infection.

Typically, the street provides various goods and meets residents' needs with stores, shops and restaurants. Yet, during the first to third day of Chinese New Year, which are public holidays in Hong Kong, shops in Kweilin Street would be closed and Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) officers who are supposed to crack down those unlicensed hawkers go off duty. Hawkers seize the opportunity to develop their businesses there, attracting large amounts of locals. However, the night market is controlled by Hong Kong government due to the safety, traffic and noise problems. Characteristics Kweilin Street Night Market only takes place in the first three days of the Lunar New Year. As most restaurants are closed during that period, the hawkers will set up stalls at night to sell foods since there is a large potential market. The hawkers in the night market are not licensed by the government and they operate illegally. Officers of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department will regularly dispel the hawkers. At night, some hawkers set up some stalls on the street and sell traditional and local cooked foods such as steam rice noodle rolls, stinky tofu, curry fish balls, sausages and other snacks. Also, some street stalls sell goods such as clothes, groceries, dolls and second-hand items. Due to its proximity to Golden Computer Plaza, which has a variety of electronic gadgets, and plenty of eateries, it has already become a popular place for young people to hangout there. As the stream of people is high in Kweilin Street, it appeals a lot of residents to set up stalls and thus the prosperous night market is born while this place also brings older generation priceless memories of a bygone era. Opinions surrounding Kweilin Street Night Market Benefits The market helps to preserve of traditional culture. Hawker culture has existed since after World War II.http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr14-15/english/panels/fseh/fseh_hp/papers/fseh_hp20150302cb4-561-1-e.pdf It sticks with the development of Hong Kong and becomes one of the local cultures. It is believed that hawkers represent a part of Hong Kong‚Äôs culture and the existence of the night market will maintain the culture and collective memories belonged to local people.https://thestandnews.com/politics/%E6%88%91%E8%A6%81%E5%81%9A%E5%B0%8F%E8%B2%A9-%E6%88%91%E8%A6%81%E7%AF%A4%E9%AD%9A%E8%9B%8B/ The night market can boost in tourism of Hong Kong. It is believed that the markets can be tourist attractions if managed properly. Amid the need for new tourist spots to increase its attractiveness, the preservation of night market may help to attract more tourists. Also, the market can alleviate the difficult situation of impoverished people. Old, unskilful people are always unpopular in labour market; yet, have to meet their own needs. They are forced to be unlicensed hawker to earn their income, to risk and violate laws. If night market is made permanent, they can find a way to earn more money. Liabilities There is a concern about safety problem of the food in the night market. As the hawkers are unlicensed, there is a potential risk that the food might contain bacteria which are harmful to the safety of customers. Also, the stalls are located near the road and the exhaust gas of car may contaminate the foods. Also, there are a traffic problem that appeared in those three days. Traffic congestion and accidents could easily happen because most of the cooked food stalls and vendors stall are set up near the road. Besides, environmental hygiene problem is another concern. Some customers, who are insufficient of civility, would litter the used skewer and plastic cup which can influence the hygienic problem nearby and stacking of refuse was serious because no one will clean up the rubbish in that period. In addition, the stalls will release soot during making processes of deep-fried intestines and barbecued food. The smell of cooking spreads to the houses which can affect the living environment of local residents. In addition, the customers will produce clamour. Some residents report the noise problem to the district councillor and it will affect the living quality. As the night market starts in the evening, the noise can influence the sleeping quality of the local residents. Future direction for development In March 2015, in Subcommittee on Hawker Policy under Panel on Food Safety and Environmental Hygiene, Dr Ko Wing-man, Secretary for Food and Health in Hong Kong introduced three suggestions to deal with the issues related to those unlicensed selling foods. The suggestions are listed as below Consider the issue of new \\"Dai Pai Tong\\" licences Food and Environmental Hygiene Department prepares to consider issuing new \\"Dai Pai Tong\\" (the operation of on-street fixed-pitches selling cooked food or light refreshment) licences\\" if district councils agree on it. Consider converting existing public market with low occupancy into off-street cooked food centre Department suggest offering some available sites as food centre for hawkers to provide various traditional local food. The centres could be run by social enterprises with planning and management instead of developing it like public market of Hong Kong which is lack of adaptability and responsiveness to business environment. Set up district- led open-air hawker bazaars and night markets On the premise of having the support from district council, finding appropriate venues and maintaining standard of environmental hygiene and food safety, government will be supportive of those applications for setting up bazaars and night markets.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, from Tibet and China, with pale blue, blue-purple, purple, violet or white flowers. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. Description It has short rhizome with a few branches. Below is thick roots. On top of the rhizomes are the brown, fibrous remains of last seasons leaves, surrounding the new leaves. It has grey-green, sword- shaped and slightly curved leaves. They grow up to between long and 1‚Äì2 cm wide. They do not have any mid-veins. The leaves are generally short than the flower stems. It has flowering stems that can grow up to between long. The stems have between 2‚Äì5 branches. The plant is very similar in form to Iris dichotoma but only smaller. The stems have 3‚Äì5 green, spathes (leaves of the flower bud), which have membranous margins. They are long and 7‚Äì8 mm wide. The bracts are similar in size to Iris dichotoma. The stems (and branches) hold between 2 and 4 flowers, between June to August. But normally in June. Leading from the spathes are stiff, pedicels (or peduncles), that are between long. The flowers are in diameter, and come in shades of pale blue, blue-purple, purple, or violet. Later, a white flowering form was found and then was published and named as Iris subdichotoma f. alba Y. G. Shen, in 'Acta Bot. Yunnan' Vol.26 Issue5 page492 in 2004). Although this is now classified as a synonym of Iris subdichotoma. It has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals, known as the 'standards'.} The falls are oblanceolate, and 4 cm long and long. The falls have a central yellow crest. The standards are narrow and oblanceolate, and 3 cm long and 4 mm wide. It has a 2 cm long perianth tube, 2.2 cm long stamens, 1.5 long and 0.5 cm wide, fusiform (spindle-shaped) ovary and 3 cm long style branches. The styles branches have narrowly triangular lobes. It also has filaments that are longer than the anthers. After the iris has flowered, it produces a cylindric seed capsule, between July to September, that is long and 1 cm wide. It has 6 longitudinal ribs. The capsule when ripe, splits a third of the way down, releasing the seeds. The seeds are 7.5 ‚Äì 8.5 mm wide, maroon-brown and have a small wings. Biochemistry In 2006, 13 species of Iris, including Iris subdichotoma, Iris delavayi and Iris cuniculiformis were studied for a cytological analysis of the chromosome counts. In 2007, the chromosomes of Iris dichotoma, Iris domestica (Belamcanda chinensis) and Iris subdichotoma were also studied. As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. Iris subdichotoma has a count of 2n=42.  Taxonomy It has the common name of 'Zhongdian iris'. Note; 'Zhongdian' is an older name for Shangri-La City. It is written as ‰∏≠Áî∏È∏¢Â∞æ in Chinese script and known as zhong dian yuan wei in Pidgin Chinese. The Latin specific epithet subdichotoma refers to Iris dichotoma (Also known as the Vesper Iris). 'Dichotoma' means forked in pairs or having 2 branches. It is very similar in form to Iris dichotoma but smaller. It was first published and described by Yu Tang Zhao in 'Acta Phytotaxonomica Sinica' (Acta Phytotax. Sin. published in Beijing) Vol.18 Issue 1 on page 57 in 1980. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003 and then updated on 29 September 2008. Iris subdichotoma is an accepted name by the RHS. Distribution and habitat It is native to temperate regions of Asia. Range It has been found in Chinese province of Yunnan, in China. It has been found on Haba Snow Mountain, and beside the Yangtze River. Habitat It grows in grasslands, on open hillsides or on banks or slopes beside rivers. It grows at altitudes of between above sea level. References Sources *Mathew, B. 1981. The Iris. 205. *Waddick, J. W. & Zhao Yu-tang. 1992. Iris of China.

He also advises to reduce imports and develop royal factories, supported by the state. Henry partly supports this program. In 1598 Laffemas continued writing his ideas on trade and manufacture. Writing his ideas may have been required to receive support from Henry IV. They acted as a balance to those of Sully, more interested in agriculture. In the same year Laffemas published Les Tr√©sors et richesses pour mettre l'Estat en splendeur, which blasted those who frowned on French silks because the industry created employment for the poor. This is the first known mention of Underconsumption Theory, which is later refined by John Maynard Keynes. New letters New letters patent of July 20, 1602 ordered the Commission to assemble regularly to attend to the execution of previous orders required by the body and communities of merchants. He received the king, 15 November 1602. He advocated the mercantilism and encouraged the development of trade and manufacturing, differing in this from the Minister Sully, which emphasized the agriculture. He had a great influence in the areas of labor, economic and social organization and a leading role in the history of silk in Europe. The committee concludes its meetings on October 22, 1604. The political economy project of Henry IV of France based on the spread of plantations and silk industry followed Laffemas's advice. He was helped by the Protestant agronomist Olivier de Serres, a Protestant figure and author of a famous thesis on \\"The collection of Silk\\". He also got help from Fran√ßois Traucat, a native gardener of N√Æmes. Traucat was the originator of the intensive mulberry plantations in the South of France, he planted four million in mulberry bushes in Provence and Languedoc. In 1602, a Royal Decision requires every parish in the country to own a mulberry bush nursery and silk. In Paris, the Gobelins manufactory is created and the Bois de Boulogne a silkworm is built surrounded by 15,000 mulberry trees. This is also the time when the first river navigation channel is dug, the Briare Canal, while the Dutch capital is put to use to dry part of the Marais Poitevin, using as at the Flemish engineers refugee brand new Netherlands, first Protestant republic in Europe. For domestic trade, Bartholomew Laffemas emphasizes the rehabilitation and development of roads and bridges, waterways, creating service letter post. For foreign trade, source of wealth, it grows to transit trade and warehousing, trade with the Levant, the colonial trade with the creation of large French East India Company and Western. With the end of the Royal Commission in 1604, implementation of manufacturing projects will also stop at the image of that which was to be built north of the Place Royale, in Paris. In 1608, Bartholomew Laffemas complains in a treaty that his advice was ignored. The development of silk manufactures stopped and France resumed imports. Nobility In the marriage contract of his son, passed November 10, 1608, BARTHELMY is called noble. It is not known how Bartholomew became noble because it is unclear whether his father, Isaac, was. The ennoblement Bartholomew had to be acquired in return for his services. Publications Laffemas had a large number of publications about his ideas on trade and enriching the kingdom.

Siderfin and Crawforth continue to direct and curate the gallery, working collaboratively with commissioned artists. Prior to establishing Beaconsfield, Siderfin and Crawforth started Nosepaint, an organization that presented interdisciplinary art events involving artists, writers, film makers and musicians between 1991 and 1994.

The building housed one of approximately 200 Ragged Schools in the area, named after the appearance of the poverty-ridden children in attendance. Network Rail and its predecessors have owned the site since 1903, when most of the school was taken down for the expansion of the railway. Gallery The gallery programme involves the exhibition of interdisciplinary visual art and hosts artist residencies commissioned by the directors that are open to the public.

A Republican, Arnold served in the Oklahoma House of Representatives from 1976-1982, representing district 71. She served on several committees during her time in office including, the Education committee, Public Safety and Penal Affairs committee, and the City/County Government committee. In 1978, Arnold co- sponsored the House's ERA resolution. Early life Oldest of three children, Helen Arnold was born in the small town of Marysville, Kansas. During her childhood education, Arnold maintained a special interest in history and government. After graduating from high school, Arnold attended Kansas State University because of its close proximity to her family home. She majored in history and government-political science. Her future husband, Maurice Arnold, was also a native of Marysville, KS and lived across the street from Helen at Kansas State University. The two married in 1948. Maurice was a geophysicist and worked for what is now BP-Amoco (then Standolind Oil and Gas). The couple moved to Mississippi and then to Texas and next to Colorado. Finally, Maurice's job sent them down to the lab that is now the University of Oklahoma's Schusterman Center. In total, the couple moved 33 times, and ended up in Tulsa, OK with a summer home in Colorado. Career before legislation Arnold taught in Colorado and when she moved to Tulsa taught spelling and math at Madeline School (a catholic school that does not exist anymore). After doing that for a year, Arnold took up volunteer work, serving as the president for the League of Women Voters of Oklahoma. Oklahoma House of Representatives (1976-1982) Arnold campaigned and was elected as a representative of the 71st district in 1976. In 1978, the conservative wing of the Republican Party recruited someone to run against Arnold in order to remove her from office. Due to a technical error on the challenger's part, Arnold remained in her House seat. Helen was one of six other women from Tulsa serving at the time. She was instrumental in presenting and passing the nurse midwife bill along with senator Steve Wolfe. Along with Cleta Deatherage, Arnold was dubbed the \\"Mouth of the House,\\" an award given to the most outspoken freshman legislator.

When Henry Bellmon ran for governor in 1986, Arnold requested to be put on the Tax Commission. Bellmon had his doubts about a Republican on that particular commission, and following his election as governor, asked Arnold to come on his cabinet and be the Director of the Office of Public Affairs, (Department of Central Services) Arnold served in this role for three and a half years. Helen's husband, Maurice, had retired in 1980 and had the freedom to visit her frequently during her time as the Director of the Office of Public Affairs.

From a sketch in 1872 Charles Lennox Stretch MLC (6 May 1797 ‚Äì 13 October 1882), known locally as \\"Xolilizwe\\" (\\"peacemaker\\"), was a humanitarian, philanthropist, and a prominent member of the Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope. Early life Stretch was born in Bristol, England, in an old Irish family. He joined the army and was sent to southern Africa in 1818 as a captain in the 38th regiment. He was soon joined here by his brother and three sisters, who also settled in the Cape. In 1819 he served in the defense of Grahamstown before taking work as engineer and Governor Land Surveyor for Graaff-Reinet in 1823. With Andrew Geddes Bain, he helped to build the Oudeberg Pass in 1829 and the Van Ryneveld's Pass road in 1832. In 1820 he married a local Cape-born woman, Anna Hart. The couple had a child, James St Ledger Stretch, who died shortly after birth, and the couple had no further children. Frontier years (1834‚Äì1854) Stretch served in the 6th frontier war (1834‚Äì35). He was also influential in exposing the brutal execution of the Xhosa King Hintsa, at the hands of Governor Harry Smith and the Southey brothers. In 1836 he was appointed as a diplomatic agent with the Xhosa \\"Gaika\\", Imidange and Amabele tribes. Stretch was a fervent supporter of the policies of Andries Stockenstr√∂m, in bringing a degree of peace to the frontier and reining back white settlers from moving into Xhosa lands. Like Stockenstr√∂m, he was an idealist who detested the injustices against the Xhosa, but was also an adept fighter who agreed to take up arms for the Cape when war did break out. For much of his career, Stretch was involved in a long-running struggle against the influential missionary Henry Calderwood ‚Äì a fierce imperialist who worked to evict the Xhosa from their lands. He was also deeply hated and distrusted by the imperial establishment and by the British settlers of the frontier. With the outbreak of the 7th frontier war (1846‚Äì47), Stretch fought with a Fengu (\\"Fingo\\") division, but very quickly came to clash with the British authorities and was dismissed. After his dismissal he returned to being a government surveyor, based at his farm at Doorn kloof, in the Mancazana valley. However he continued his activism unofficially, passing information on to his few remaining political allies in London and writing polemics against British frontier policies. His letters and writings are a valuable record of the Frontier Wars, and provide an important account from the pro-Xhosa perspective.N.Mostert: Frontiers: The Epic of South Africa's Creation and the Tragedy of the Xhosa People. Pimlico. 1992. Political career (1854‚Äì1873) Stretch was elected as Member of the Assembly (lower house) of the Cape Parliament when it was first formed in 1854, representing Fort Beaufort on the frontier together with Richard Joseph Painter. He changed his constituency in 1859, when he represented Port Elizabeth in the same parliament. In 1868 he went on to serve in the Legislative Council (upper house) of the Cape Parliament, where he represented the Eastern Circle (Province). Stretch was a strong supporter of the movement for \\"Responsible Government\\" (local democratic self-rule) ‚Äì a movement which progressively grew through the 1850s and 60s, as frustration with British rule mounted. Most MPs from the eastern part of the Cape tended to oppose responsible government though, and Stretch was unusual in his support. He was one of only two \\"eastern\\" members of the Legislative Council to support it consistently, and his active persistent support was therefore crucial in finally getting it passed in 1872. He retired from politics in 1873. Further reading * C.L.Stretch: The journal of Charles Lennox Stretch. Grahamstown Series: Maskew Miller Longman. 1988.

Early life and education  Grace Gallatin was born in Sacramento, California on January 28, 1872. In 1888 she began writing articles for San Francisco newspapers under the pen name of Dorothy Dodge, and in 1892 graduated from Packer Collegiate Institute, in Brooklyn, NY. Career  Writing  In 1900 Seton published her first book, A Woman Tenderfoot, which described her trip on horseback through the Rocky Mountains. In 1907 she published the book Nimrod's Wife, a true hunting and travel book set in the Western United States. She later organized and directed a women's motor unit to aid soldiers in France during the first World War. During the 1920s and 1930s she visited China, Egypt, Hawaii, India, Indochina, Japan, and South America, and she wrote four books about her travels: A Woman Tenderfoot in Egypt (1923), Chinese Lanterns (1924), Yes, Lady Saheb (1925), and Poison Arrows (1938). She also wrote The Singing Traveler (1947), a collection of poems about mysticism and eastern religions.  Activism  As a suffragist, she served as vice-president and later president of the Connecticut Woman Suffrage Association, from 1910 to 1920. She also worked for women's causes by serving as president of the National League of American Pen Women (1926-1928 and 1930-1932), during which time the number of branches of that organization doubled, and serving as chair of letters of the National Council of Women of the United States (1933-1938). As chair she established the Biblioteca Femina, a collection of volumes by women from all over the world, which was later donated to the Northwestern University Library. She also helped organize an international conference of women writers at the Century of Progress Exposition held in Chicago in 1933, and was a member of the International Council of Women, the Society of Woman Geographers, and the Women's National Republican Club. Seton also belonged to Pen and Brush. She served as president of Pen and Brush from 1898 to 1939. Marriage She was married to Ernest Thompson Seton, one of the founding pioneers of the Boy Scouts of America, and conflicts arose with the Boy Scouts about her suffrage activities and his British citizenship. The citizenship issue arose partly because of his high position within BSA, and because the federal charter James E. West was attempting to obtain for the BSA required its board members to be United States citizens. Ernest drafted his written resignation on January 29, 1915, but he did not send it to BSA until May. Grace had married Ernest in 1896; she separated from him by the late 1920s, and they divorced in 1935. Her daughter Anya Seton, also an author, was born in 1904.  Death  Seton died in Palm Beach, Florida on March 19, 1959.

He was born in Tralee, in County Kerry, but spent most summers in Birr, County Tipperary, where the family had connections to the Midland Tribune newspaper. He saw his first fine art in magazines sent from England by relatives. He preserved many such pictures. He frequently cycled to Limerick to visit art exhibitions and his uncle, an art tutor at the Limerick School of Art. As a teen he designed and made sets, masks and costumes for the local amateur drama group in Tralee. He planned and ran the lighting on performance nights. He was an active member of the Music Association in Tralee. He applied to the Central College of Art in London, and was accepted on the strength of his drawings. He had exceptional talent as a draughtsman and studied Fine Art painting and printmaking. When he left for London, Rose, his wife-to-be, followed him. They were married in a Southwark church. After studying part- time the need to earn a living for his new family became too demanding and he was forced to give up his studies. The family returned to Ireland in 1973. He continued to paint. He exhibited rarely but had private followers in Ireland and the UK. During this time he had paintings accepted to the prestigious RHA Summer Exhibitions in 1988 and 1993. He died just as he neared the completion of a set of works intended for a solo exhibition. Practice He researched his paintings sitting in fields and graveyards with his sketchbook and watercolours, then finished the works on a painter's easel at home. He worked primarily in oils and distemper (which was unusual for the times), but allowed him to achieve the palette that he needed. He worked mostly on board rather than canvas. He was influenced by the works of Morandi and the theories of colour psychology. He was interested in popular science and natural history and had an extensive library of these as well as art topics.

His parents, Brett and Naghemeh King, took their son out of Southampton General Hospital (England) in August 2014 over a disagreement with doctors regarding his treatment. King had a medulloblastoma, which was successfully removed through surgery on 24 July 2014. He received further neurosurgery on 22 August. King's parents desired their son be treated with proton therapy, which they felt was less harmful than conventional radiotherapy. At that time the National Health Service (NHS) did not provide proton therapy in the United Kingdom, however it has funded treatment abroad since April 2008 where evidence has shown there to be benefit. In this case the doctors did not support moving the boy so that he could get proton therapy, and in response, on 28 August 2014, the parents took their son out of the hospital without telling the medical team and boarded a ferry to France. On 28 August 2014, an international manhunt for King and his parents commenced. On 30 August, King and his parents were found in Velez Malaga, Spain. King's parents were arrested and their son was sent to a local hospital for urgent treatment. They were held in prison for more than 24 hours and released when the request to extradite them to the United Kingdom was withdrawn.Judgment and Family Court Orders in the matter of Ashya King The issues about treating the boy were brought to the High Court to be resolved, and on 5 September 2014, the court ruled that King could receive proton therapy in Prague. Doctors from Southampton General Hospital said the treatment would have the same side effects as conventional radiotherapy. On 9 September, King arrived at the Proton Therapy Center in Prague, where he underwent proton beam therapy. In March 2015, Brett King said that a brain scan showed no evidence that Ashya had a brain tumour. A 2015 report reviewing the case stated that King's parents' decision to deny their child chemotherapy had reduced his chances of survival by 30 percent. Reviews also called on health providers to do a better job communicating with parents. In 2016, following the publication of a prospective phase II trial the NHS decided it will pay for children with medulloblastoma to travel abroad to receive proton therapy. In 2018, MRI scans conducted in Southampton showed Ashya to be free of cancer.

To publicize the release of the film in 1954, Ben Chapman, in costume, introduced the Gill- Man to the public on live television in The Colgate Comedy Hour with Abbott and Costello. Film influence * Many films featuring monsters put the Gill- Man's likeness in the background as an homage. Its likeness was also used for the film The Monster Squad. However, due to licensing issues with Universal, the Creature is referred to as the Gill-Man. * In the 1955 comedy The Seven Year Itch, Marilyn Monroe and Tom Ewell come out of a theater showing Creature from the Black Lagoon. Monroe expresses some sympathy for the Gill-Man, saying that it was not really bad and that it \\"just wanted to be loved\\". * The Gill- man appears in the Rankin/Bass Productions Halloween film, Mad Monster Party?, as one of many monsters invited to Baron Boris von Frankenstein's monster reunion party. It also appears in the Rankin/Bass TV film Mad Mad Mad Monsters as one of many monsters invited to Baron Henry von Frankenstein's wedding of the Monster and his newly-created Bride. * The Gill-man reappears in Fred Dekker‚Äôs The Monster Squad, where it shows little interest in human females as opposed to its classic counterpart. Instead, it allies itself with Count Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, the Mummy and the Wolfman in order to secure a magical amulet which will allow them to conquer the world. After snapping the necks of several policemen, the Gill-man is killed by Monster Squad member Horace, who shoots it with a shotgun. For its appearance in The Monster Squad, the Gill-man was redesigned by Stan Winston in order to merely suggest Milicent Patrick‚Äôs original design, due to licensing issues. The Gill-man was the first costume portrayal of Tom Woodruff, Jr. who would later work prominently in the Alien film series. * Director William Winckler was inspired by the film when producing his 2005 black-and-white horror film Frankenstein vs. the Creature from Blood Cove. In the 90-minute retro monster movie, a bio- genetically engineered half-man, half-fish creature battles Frankenstein's monster on a beach and beneath the waves, with underwater photography reminiscent of the underwater shots in Creature from the Black Lagoon. A stuntman/diver wearing a full-body latex rubber costume was used to portray the Blood Cove creature on camera, not unlike Ben Chapman and Ricou Browning in costume in Creature from the Black Lagoon. * The 2017 film The Shape of Water is a romantic fantasy between a mute woman and an amphibious creature (performed by Doug Jones) from South America. Director Guillermo del Toro was inspired to make the film from childhood memories of seeing the Julia Adams swimming scene in Creature from the Black Lagoon and hoping the creature would get with the girl.http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3457493/iconic-horror- movie-scene-inspired-shape-water/ Television influence * In an Abbott and Costello sketch on TV's The Colgate Comedy Hour, the Gill-man appears in a haunted house after the Frankenstein Monster faints at the sight of Lou Costello. * In an episode of the classic TV series The Munsters, the Munster family receives a visit from \\"Uncle Gilbert\\", who proudly refers to himself as the \\"Creature from the Black Lagoon\\". *The TV series I'll Be Gone in the Dark repeatedly references the swimming scene from the film. * In The Comic Strip, he has a son named Lagoon. * Attack of the Killer Tomatoes: The Animated Series parodied the film in \\"The Tomato from the Black Lagoon\\". In this episode, the gang looks for a missing-tomato-link in the San Zucchini Botanical Gardens, whilst they are stalked by an amphibious tomato that goes after Tara (who is also part tomato). * The Gill-Man appeared in the Robot Chicken episode \\"Shoe\\", voiced by Seth Green. He tells a man that he prefers the lagoon to be called the \\"African-American Lagoon\\". It also appears in the Robot Chicken sketch \\"We Are a Humble Factory\\", now voiced by Breckin Meyer. Learning of the success of Count Chocula, FrankenBerry, and BooBerry, as well as Fruity Yummy Mummy and Fruit Brute appearing as generic monster who are also jealous of the threesome having their own cereal, the Gill-Man decides to make his own cereal called \\"Creature with the Black Macaroons\\" because \\"macaroon\\" sounds like \\"lagoon\\" and are said to turn milk black. However, the cereal was not successful. When all the cereal were dumped into his lagoon, he says \\"Should've gone with legumes\\" as \\"legume\\" also sounds like \\"lagoon\\". Musical references * Trinidadian calypso singer Lord Melody released a song called \\"Creature From The Black Lagoon\\" in 1957. In this song, he is compared to the Gill-Man by his son's friends, which his son protests. This song became one of his signature songs and also endured as a nickname for Melody for many years. * Dave Edmunds, with his band Rockpile, also performed a song called \\"Creature from the Black Lagoon\\". Edmunds' song, included in his 1979 album Repeat When Necessary, was written by Rockpile's lead guitarist Billy Bremner. * Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13, a band from North Carolina who were fronted by Murderdolls lead singer and solo artist Wednesday 13, also did a song about the Gill-Man, titling it \\"Creature from the Black Lagoon\\". * The heavy metal band Iced Earth also did a song about the Gill-Man called \\"Dragon's Child\\" on the Horror Show album. Other cultural influences 1962 magazine cover depicting the Gill-Man * Creature from the Black Lagoon was made into a pinball game, designed by John Trudreau (a.k.a. \\"Dr. Flash\\") and released in 1992 by Midway under the Bally brand name. It has a retro 1950s drive-in theme.

The initial house was built in 1869, with later additions, and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.  History  Henry Piper built the two-story gable-roofed section in 1869 - basically a farmhouse with pediment-shaped window heads and the small portico over the front entry. In 1888 the house was purchased for $300 by David W. Heiney as he was traveling from Pennsylvania to Mazomanie to visit his father, on his honeymoon with his wife Emma. With Heiney made extensive improvements, adding a floor to the residence, and that same year, opening Heiney's Meat Market in the basement. The business was immediately successful. The market space was expanded in 1911 with a one-story addition. Additional buildings followed, including an icehouse, chicken coops, a lard rendering operation, a smokehouse, and a horse barn; of these, only the latter two buildings remain. The brick house was added in 1922 by David's son Ervin Heiney. In 1919, Heiney's Meat Market was the site of a \\"secret meeting\\" to help Madison's newspaper The Capital Times, which was facing a boycott due to its political views. The meeting raised over $900 in stock pledges, which helped keep the newspaper afloat. After David died in 1926, Ervin and his brother Wilford continued to run the meat market. By the time Ervin retired in the 1960s, it was the oldest family-owned business in town. After the last of the Heiney family died in 1967, the space was sold and converted to a television repair shop, then subsequently remained vacant for a while. In 1977 Carol Moeller and Donna Obright purchased the property. They initially opened it as an antique shop, but soon after (in 1979) they renovated the property into a cocktail lounge and restaurant known as Corodonn's Meat Market. It was Moeller and Obright who got the property listed on the National Register in 1984, after two years of research and red tape. It was listed under the name Heiney's Meat Market, after the original butcher shop owner. It was the first property in Black Earth to be named to the National Register of Historic Places. In 1994 the restaurant was purchased by new owners. In 2014 after 20 years of operation, they decided to sell the place, but had difficulty in finding buyers. In 2015-2016, the property was converted to apartments.

She was also the first woman accepted into the University of Haiti Medical School, and earned her medical degree in 1940. After graduation, she worked as a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology in the Port-au-Prince General Hospital. As Haiti's first female practitioner she played an important role in providing improved medical access and tools for Haitian citizens. Among her other accomplishments, she was also one of the voices fighting for physical, economical, social and political equality of Haitian women.  Early life and education  Dr. Yvonne Sylvain was born in Port-au-Prince to Eug√©nie Mallebranche and Georges Sylvain, a Haitian activist and an important figure of resistance against the American occupation of Haiti. They had seven children, one of them being Suzanne Comhaire-Sylvain, Haiti‚Äôs first woman anthropologist. Influenced heavily by her father, she attended Ecole Normale d‚Äôinstitutrices, where she graduated and began to work as a teacher. At the age of 28, she was the first woman accepted into the medical school of the University of Haiti, and earned her medical degree in 1940. She then received a scholarship from the Inter-American Health Bureau and was admitted to the Columbia University Medical School. Three years after her internship she worked at the New York Post-Graduate Medical School and Hospital on a Pan- American Sanitary Bureau Fellowship.  Career  Dr. Yvonne Sylvain made many contributions to the medical field in Haiti and inspired other Haitian women to follow her steps. By 1953, thirteen years after Sylvain had graduated medical school, eight Haitian women had already received their doctor of medicine degree from University of Haiti and began practicing in Haiti. At the time, the University of Haiti had 241 medical students enrolled, 17 of them were women. Following her graduation, she worked for many years at the General Hospital in obstetrics and gynecology. The high mortality rate in Haiti inspired her to be a doctor, she invested her time and skills in treating many Haitians for various diseases. She was passionate about the immediate health problems plaguing Haitians: sterility, overpopulation, cancer. She also became a professor of medicine at the University of Haiti. She published many articles in medical journals and continued to research about the lethal health issues occurring in Haiti. She then became the Vice-President of the Haitian Foundation for Health and Education. Upset by Haiti‚Äôs poor means of cancer treatment, Sylvain became adamant about investing in X-rays and other medical equipment to diagnose cancer. It was her dream for more medical advancements to arrive in Haiti in order to decrease the number of Haitians dying of cancer. She was a part of the Haitian League Against Cancer and helped introduced in Haiti the papanicolaou test for uterine cancer screening. She created a special committee that helped collect funding from France and among the Haitian diaspora for a hospital that she wanted to build in Fr√®res, a city in Haiti ten-minutes away from P√©tionville, in order to provide medical access to a community of over 100,000 people. Showing commitment to the cause, she remained the Vice-President of the Haitian Foundation for Health and Education until her death. With her organization improving Haitian hospitals, she began to work as a delegate in public health, especially for the reproductive health and research for the World Health Organization (WHO). She also brought her medical knowledge to several African countries like Nigeria and Senegal and worked as a doctor in Costa Rica.  Art  She actively promoted Haitian culture through her art. She was taught under Normil Charles and also influenced by Petion Savain. She worked heavily in the fields of art, painting, writing, art criticism, theater and even radio animation. She was a very important cultural operator for her community. Art, painting and theater were very important interest for Yvonne Sylvain during her early stages of life because she was deeply inserted in a very cultural community. By 1932, she had exhibited over thirty oil paintings and drawings. However the helplessness she felt from her mother‚Äôs passing inspired the 28 years of devotion to medical sciences.  Activism  She was also active in the women's suffrage movement, namely in the Ligue F√©minine d'Action Sociale, which helped give Haitian women the right to vote in 1950. She also published articles on public health issues in the Ligue's news outlet, La Voix des Femmes.

Aaron J. Buckley and Akiko Ikeda, The Journal of ERW and Mine Action. Issue 13.3, Winter 2009: http://www.jmu.edu/cisr/journal/13.3/notes/buckley_ikeda/buckley.shtml History Women's advancement instruments in national bureaucracies started in the mid-1970s. While the concept of gender mainstreaming appeared in the mid-1980s, it was formalised in the early 1990s. Gender mainstreaming in mine action was first mentioned in 1995 at the Beijing Platform for Action in the section on armed conflict, by stating that \\"women and children are particularly affected by the indiscriminate use of anti-personnel land- mines\\".Beijing Platform for Action, 1995. Strategic objective E.2. Reduce excessive military expenditures and control the availability of armaments. Actions to be taken: 143.e.: http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/platform/armed.htm Gender mainstreaming in mine action was part of a larger movement to end discrimination and mainstream gender in security sector reform. Before guidelines on how to integrate gender into mine action were standardised, several documents were published to highlight the importance of gender mainstreaming in that domain.A Guide to Mine Action. GICHD, 2013: p.113 to 115: http://www.gichd.org/fileadmin/GICHD-resources/rec-documents/Guide-to- mine-action-2014.pdf It later gained more support thanks to the UN Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000) on \\"Women, Peace and Security\\" which emphasised \\"the need for all parties to ensure that mine clearance and mine awareness programmes take into account the special needs of women and girls\\". In 2005 the UN Gender Guidelines for Mine Action Programmes provided the first comprehensive description of how to mainstream gender in mine action, afterwards revised in 2010.http://www.mineaction.org/sites/default/files/publications/MA-Guidelines- WEB.pdf This guide is a manual destined to be used by the UN mine action field-based personnel and headquarters' staff and other actors involved in the sector.  Convention and Normative Documents on Gender Mainstreaming in Mine Action  The Convention on Cluster Munition (2008) underlines that \\"Each State Party with respect to cluster munition victims (‚Ä¶) shall (‚Ä¶) adequately provide age- and gender-sensitive assistance\\".Convention on Cluster Munitions. Article 5, Victim assistance, p.9: http://www.clusterconvention.org/files/2011/01/Convention-ENG.pdf The Vientiane Action Plan 2010-2015 (2010),http://www.clusterconvention.org/files/2011/01/VIENTIANE-ACTION-PLAN- Final2.pdf adopted at the First Meeting of States Parties to the Convention on Cluster Munition in Lao PDR also includes gender issues in several action points, such as on Clearance and destruction of cluster munition remnants and risk reduction activities. For instance, Action 14 writes that there should be \\"gender-sensitive participation of the community to the development of national clearance plans, planning and prioritisation of clearance activities and land release\\". Action 17 states that \\"mine risk education should be tailored to the needs of affected communities, gender sensitive and age appropriate\\". In addition to the previous two, Action 22 requires states to collect sex and age disaggregated data on victims, and Action 30 that victims should be fully included in the work of the convention in a gender and age sensitive way. The Strategy of the United Nation on Mine Action 2013-2018 (2013) encourages \\"further efforts (‚Ä¶) dedicated to strengthening and mainstreaming gender perspectives in mine action planning, implementation and evaluation\\".The Strategy of the United Nation on Mine Action 2013-2018, 2013, p.10: http://www.mineaction.org/sites/default/files/publications/mine_action_strategy_mar15.pdf The Maputo Action Plan 2014-2019 (2014)http://www.maputoreviewconference.org/fileadmin/APMBC-RC3/3RC-Maputo- action-plan-adopted-27Jun2014.pdf was adopted during the Third Review Conference of the States Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines and on their destruction (APMBC 1997). In its introduction, it stresses that States Parties will implement the Maputo Action Plan in a cooperative, inclusive, age- appropriate and gender-sensitive manner. In the section on mine clearance, gender-sensitive mine risk education (paragraph 10), opportunities and social protection measures for all mine victims, regardless of their gender and age (paragraph 10) and gender sensitive awareness raising (paragraph 17) are mentioned. The section on International cooperation and assistance encourages State parties to articulate age- and gender-sensitive time-bound objectives and targets (paragraph 21) and to support programmes that provide accurate gender sensitive information and that promote gender mainstreaming (paragraph 22). The International Mine Action Standards (IMAS) were created in 2001 and are under constant revision. They provide procedures and concrete steps to follow all UN mine action operations. However, they are also the main guide for operators and national mine action programmes to establish their own National Mine Action Standards (NMAS). After the revision of IMAS in 2009,http://www.mineactionstandards.org/fileadmin/MAS/documents/review- board/others/Main-report-gender-review-IMAS-final.pdf the dimension of gender was included in several of them, concerning land release and handover (IMAS 07.11);http://www.mineactionstandards.org/fileadmin/MAS/documents/imas- international-standards/english/series-07/IMAS-07.11-Ed.1-Am2.pdf Mine Risk Education (IMAS 04.10http://www.mineactionstandards.org/fileadmin/MAS/documents/imas- international- standards/english/series-04/IMAS_04.10_Glossary_of_mine_action_terms__definitions_and_abbreviations.pdf and IMAS 12.10);http://www.mineactionstandards.org/fileadmin/MAS/documents/imas- international-standards/english/series-12/IMAS-12-10-Ed2-Am2.pdf non-technical surveys (IMAS 08.10).http://www.mineactionstandards.org/fileadmin/MAS/documents/imas- international-standards/english/series-08/IMAS-08.10-Ed.1-Am2.pd Examples of Gender Mainstreaming in Mine Action Since 2006 the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) has been conducting workshops on gender mainstreaming in mine action both in the field and in Geneva at the presence of representatives of mine action organisation, focused on explaining what gender mainstreaming is and helping countries implementing the UN guidelines. The Swiss Campaign to Ban Landmines created the Gender and Mine Action Programme in 2006 to specifically focus on the implementation of gender mainstreaming in mine action. The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) in 2013 reviewed the work of the Danish Demining Group (DDG) in Afghanistan, assessing positively the progress made in gender mainstreaming, in terms of the collection of disaggregated qualitative and quantitative data, in spite of some cultural limitations.Review of the DDG Humanitarian Mine Action Support to the National Strategy through Clearance and Enhanced Quality Project in Afghanistan (October 2010 ‚Äì September 2013).

Kateland Shane. The Journal of ERW and Mine Action. Issue 12.2, Winter 2008-2009: http://www.jmu.edu/cisr/journal/12.2/profiles/shane/shane.shtml Mine clearance The UN Gender Guidelines state that men, women, boys and girls differ in their exposure to and knowledge of the mine contamination. The Guidelines write that mine-action operators should obtain information about the mine situation from both sexes in all age groups in order for information to be complete and accurate before demining. Having more accurate information before can reduce costs because less time and money are spent on demining uncontaminated areas. Its concrete recommendations are: * Gather data at the best times and locations for all individuals. * Gather data from both men and women about the location of explosive devices and the projected use of cleared land. * Also include women into the survey and clearance teams. Mine-risk education (MRE) The UN Gender Guidelines say that men, women, boys and girls differ in their behaviours and their response to mine-risk education. Its recommendations are: * Gather data that illustrate the behaviours that put at risk people of both genders. * Gather data that indicates how people of both genders would react to potential mine and UXO threats. * Determine the best instructor for both genders. * Hold MRE meetings at the most convenient times and places for recipients. * Ensure that both genders understand properly MRE messages. * Have women as instructors. Victim assistance For victim assistance, the guidelines explains that women and men have often different access to victim assistance due to cultural barriers and other obstacles. It states that mine action organisations should consider these barriers and their vulnerability to the economic, psychological and social implications of disability. The Guidelines' recommendations are: * Collect age- and sex-disaggregated data about victims, their needs and the level of access to services. * Support survivor advocacy and awareness. * Include women into victim assistance teams to ensure access to female victims in conservative contexts. Advocacy In terms of advocacy, the guidelines state that women and men have different sensibilities to messages and access to communication channels. Mine action organisations have to consider these peculiarities in planning advocacy activities. Its recommendations are: * Tailor advocacy initiatives to women, girls, boys and men * Convey information on the benefits of compliance with international legal norms addressing the mine/ERW problem and victim assistance * Encourage advocacy activities among women, girls, boys and men in mine/ERW-affected communities Gender and Mine Action Programme (GMAP) The Gender and Mine Action Programme (GMAP) is a programme of the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD) that strives for and contributes to increasing the effectiveness of mine action activities through the inclusion of a gender and diversity perspective in policy making, programming, and implementation. GMAP was created in December 2006 by the Swiss Campaign to Ban Landmines. Before its integration in the GICHD in March 2019, GMAP worked as an independent organization for more than 12 years, aiming to promote gender mainstreaming in mine action by trying to make mine action include the needs, priorities, and knowledge of women, girls, boys, men, and members of marginalized groups in communities at risk of landmines or other UXO. The goal of gender and diversity mainstreaming is to make mine action more inclusive, efficient and effective. The goal of the Programme is to research, provide training and consultation, create guidelines and strategies,http://www.macca.org.af/macca/wp- content/uploads/2014/06/MAPA-gender-mainstreaming-strategy- FINAL.pdfhttp://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2014_2019/documents/femm/dv/gbv_toolkit_book_01_20_2015_/gbv_toolkit_book_01_20_2015_en.pdf create awareness, and publish material related to gender and diversity in mine action. They also support hiring more women in mine action including mine clearance. It was hosted in the offices of the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD) in Geneva, Switzerland for 9 years before its official integration in the GICHD. GMAP is part of a Gender and Diversity in Security Hub with other security organizations at the Maison de la Paix in Geneva: Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF), Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD), Geneva Centre for Security Policy (GCSP), and Small Arms Survey (SAS). Criticism Like many criticisms of the gender mainstreaming movement in general, gender mainstreaming in mine action has faced similar problems such as ineffective results, poor implementation, those using it to hinder progress, and being primarily western dominated. Asa Massleberg, for the Gender and Mine Action Programme, wrote that the common measurements of success in mine action, such as meters squared of land cleared of mines and number of people who received a service, are insufficient because they do not take into account the overall and long term impact of a community. She argues it can only be done by assessing all the processes and procedures in a project cycle which are adapted to the needs of women, girls, boy and men in a community. According to the Gender and Mine Action Programme, the effects of gender mainstreaming are still largely undocumented, not understood by those implementing it, and require further research. Trying to deal with other biases not included in gender mainstreaming, the Gender and Mine Action Programme has also expanded gender mainstreaming to include the term diversity. Gender and diversity mainstreaming includes other factors in the demographics of a community that may hinder or help the long term impact of mine action.

Biography The son of Robert and Annie Jack, John Jack was born at Ch√¢teauguay, Quebec, Canada. His father was a blacksmith-turned-farmer of Scottish descent, his mother a horticulturist of English descent who wrote articles under the title Garden News. Jack was educated at his local protestant school as well as at home with his horticulturalist mother teaching him. His father was also an early botanical influence teaching him about pruning and grafting. His mother was also active in finding him mentors, corresponding with John William Dawson for assistance with this. Dawson would go on to befriend Jack. Jack was later sent to the Franklin Academy as well as another private academy to obtain further education. He spent two winters studying entomology with Dr H. A. Hagen at Harvard, and a summer working in the grounds of Mr E. S. Carmen, publisher of the Rural New Yorker and his future father-in-law, at River Edge, New Jersey.Pearson, L. (2014). John George Jack,: Dendrologist, Educator, Plant Explorer. Arnoldia, 71.4, (2014). Jack, K. (2002). John George Jack Career In 1886, Jack joined the Arnold Arboretum as a working student under the direction of Professor C. S. Sargent, who recommended Jack's promotion to Lecturer in arboriculture five years later in 1891. During this period, Jack also spent two summers working as an agent of the Geological Survey, and the Department of Agriculture, exploring the forests of Colorado and of the Bighorn Mountains in Wyoming. He went on to serve as an Instructor in Forestry at Harvard, and as Lecturer in Forestry at MIT before appointment as Assistant Professor of Dendrology at the Arnold Arboretum in 1908; he retired in 1935. Foreign adventures Jack travelled widely, visiting Europe in 1891, Canada in 1894, and the Far East in 1905, when he returned with seeds of 650 species and varieties of both wild and cultivated plants, many of them new to the USA. Notable introductions included the hardy winter hazel Corylopsis glabrescens, and several rhododendrons including schlippenbachii. In 1926, Jack was asked by Sargent to visit Cuba and collect material for the Arnold Arboretum herbarium from the Atkins Institution plantation at Cienfuegos, a task Jack repeated several times over the next nine years until his compulsory retirement when aged 74. Personal life Jack married Cerise Carmen (d.1935), daughter of his former employer Elbert S Carmen, in 1907. They had no children of their own, but adopted two. Death In 1948, Jack fell from a ladder and broke his hip while tending his orchard; bedridden thereafter, he died the following year aged 88.

Background This promotion began with a name in 1989. In May 1989 the foundation CPNG garnered extra publicity for the genre of \\"the exciting book\\". This was done by promoting a book published by Tomas Ross, \\"Mode voor Moskou\\" (\\"Fashion for Moscow\\") that sold at a reduced price (4.95 gulden). The last chapter was left omitted, and there was a competition attached: \\"Who is the murderer?\\". The prize was a \\"Detective-weekend for two\\" in England valued at f 2499. The disclosure of the perpetrator and the announcement of the winner found a place in the NOS Television program TV 3 on May 23, 1989. The last chapter could then be collected by presenting a voucher to the booksellers. The Gouden Strop was also awarded in the same program. The action was a success, in the succeeding year there was a 'promotion-period' set between May 21 and June 1990. This time there was a prize in the same manner as Boekenweek and Kinderboekenweek. It was the booklet \\"and a Press Conference to lock...\\", a simple stapled edition of 32 pages. There was also a competition attached: \\"Who wrote this bloodcurdling football thriller?\\". This time the prize consisted of two tickets to the finale of the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Rome on July 8. Participants could choose from David Endt (Press officer of Ajax, writer of (among other works) \\"The Shadow of San Siro\\"), Arie Haan (ex- footballer, trainer), Youp van 't Hek (comedian, NRC Handelsblad sports columnist), Kees Jansma (head of NOS Studio Sport, Voetball International columnist), Theo Jockes (writer of (among others) \\"Murder in the Ridderzaal\\" and the novel \\"The Departure\\") and Jan Mulder (ex-footballer, sport columnist in de Volkskrant). The disclose of the name of the author and the announcement of the winner found a place on the Prime Time Show of RTL V√©ronique on June 28. In 1991 a fixed month (June) and name (\\"Maand van het Spannende Boek\\") were chosen. This event also selected a promotion-edition book for a reduced amount (f 5.-). \\"Broeinest\\" by Frederick Forsyth was adapted for special by the CPNB Foundation and completed a deal in July 1991 for the new book \\"De Verrader\\", also translated as \\"The Deceiver\\". A booklet was supplied with discount coupons of f 5.- per piece for 19 other 'exciting books'. The idea of including a \\"competition\\" was abandoned. In 1992, 1993 en 1994 the 'Maand' was designed in the same manner: a booklet for a reduced price (5 gulden) and a booklet with discount coupons of f 5,- per piece in to be used with 20 other 'exciting books'. A definitive prize was chosen in 1995, with a minimum purchase of f 29.50 Dutch-language books. The first prize was \\"In de val\\" by Dean Koontz. An attempt was then made in 1998 to also involve children in the promotion (The booklet \\"Het uur van de haan\\" by Thea Dubelaar, sold for one gulden) but this attempt was not repeated. In 2004 the minimum sales price was increased (to 13.45 euro - this was approximately the same as the old minimum of f 29.50 - 12.50 euros). In that year the public library was also involved, with a (for library members) a free prize: \\"Plaatsen van misdaad. Fragmenten uit dertien topthrillers\\" (\\"Places of Crime: Excerpts from the top thirteen thrillers\\"). Prizes continued to be awarded in 2005 and 2006: \\"In eigen kring. Fragmenten uit tien topthrillers\\" (\\"In their own circle. Excerpts from the top ten thrillers\\") (2005) and \\"Goed fout. Fragmenten uit misdaadverhalen van bekroonde auteurs\\" (\\"Good Error. Excerpts from the crime stories by award- winning authors\\"). The prize was revived in 2011 with \\"Stille getuigen: sporen van misdaad in 25 verhalen van de beste thrillerauteurs van dit moment\\" (\\"Silent Witnesses: traces of crime in 25 stories from the best thriller writers of the moment\\"). Beginning in 2007 a special evening named 'Evening of the Exciting Book: The Power of Plots was arranged. The first evening was on June 20, 2007. In the following years the evening was shifted to the beginning of the month: June 3, 2008, June 2, 2009, June 1, 2010.

Family Edward was born in Calais to Thomas de Grenier de Fonblanque, Vicomte de Fonblanque, Her Britannic Majesty's Consul General and Consul-General to Serbia, and Jane Catherine Barrington of Dublin. Through his grandfather, the Marquis John Anthony Fonblanque, Edward was descended from a noble Huguenot family. His great-grandfather shortened his surname, de Grenier de Fonblanque, on his naturalisation in England, though some of his descendants later added it back. Edward's uncles were Albany Fonblanque and John Samuel Martin Fonblanque. His maternal grandfather was Sir Jonah Barrington, a judge known for his popular and amusing memoirs. Edward was said to have inherited his humour and wit. Career De Fonblanque was educated in Bonn, Germany and had excellent language skills. In 1854, during the Crimean War, he served as the Deputy- Assistant Commissary-General for the Royal Army Service Corps. After the war, he was promoted to commissariat and sent to China. He later helped form the Italian Volunteer Legion during the First Boer War. He eventually joined the War Office as deputy controller. He retired early, possibly from exhaustion, which allowed him to devote his time to writing. He suffered a leg injury while riding that never properly healed, and though he was able to travel extensively, his leg was eventually amputated. Most of his writings were related to military history and were well received. A mention of his work in 1862 stated: \\"Mr. Edward de Fonblanque's serious, full and conscientious studies of military organization in the various armies of Europe, ‚Äî made, we believe, under the auspices of the present Earl of Dalhousie, and published about a year ago, ‚Äî are worth twenty works like Red, White and Blue.\\" His 1876 work, Political and Military Episodes in the Latter Half of the Eighteenth Century was devoted to British General John Burgoyne. He also penned two volumes on the noble Percy and Smythe families, as well as a children's story, Cluck-cluck. Personal life One of de Fonblanque's daughters, Louise Beatrice, married Francis William Lowther, illegitimate son of William Lowther, 2nd Earl of Lonsdale, in 1868. Another daughter, Lavinia Mary, married Wilkinson Jocelyn Shaw, son of Sir Frederick Shaw, 3rd Baronet, in 1873. By his sixth son, Lester Ramsay de Fonblanque, he was grandfather of Major-General Philip de Fonblanque, who organised logistics for the British Expeditionary Force in France and Belgium at the very beginning of the Second World War, and his namesake Major-General Edward Barrington de Fonblanque, who fought in both world wars.de Fonblanque formerly of Guildford House pedigree, Burke's Landed Gentry 1972 He lived in London, but died age 74, in Bourne End, Buckinghamshire, where he had gone to stay with a friend after falling ill.

She is credited with establishing the first kindergarten to utilize the Froebel method in M√©rida. She was the organizer of the First Feminist Congress in Mexico authorized by state governor Salvador Alvarado. Biography Consuelo Zavala Castillo was born in 1874 in M√©rida, Yucat√°n, Mexico. She studied at the Instituto Literario de Ni√±as (ILN) (Literary Institute for Girls) under the feminist teachings of Rita Cetina Guti√©rrez. She graduated at the age of 23 with a degree in elementary and higher education. After teaching at various schools in the state in 1902 founded her own school basing the curriculum on secular, scientific education methods. In 1904, Zavala participated in the 5th General Congress on Primary Education. In 1906, she established the first professional kindergarten in Yucat√°n, following the Frobel principals. In 1912, she was commissioned to study in France by president Francisco I. Madero to learn more about European educational models. She was President of the Board of Directors for the Organizing Committee of the First Feminist Congress in Mexico held in 1916, driven by the Governor of Yucat√°n, Salvador Alvarado. Numerous topics were discussed at the January meeting, but at the center of the discussion was suffrage and political involvement of all citizens, followed by women's education and women's roles as wives, mothers and their rights to divorce. A storm of controversy resulted when Hermila Galindo's paper advocating sexual education and female sexuality was read. When the second congress was held in December of that same year, Zavala who had been surprised by the amount of anti-feminist feeling that emanated from the first congress, did not attend. In 1922, Zavala helped found the Feminist League of Yucat√°n, as part of the Socialist Party of the Southeast with Elvia Carrillo Puerto, Raquel Dzib Cicero, Rosa Torre Gonz√°lez, Beatr√≠z Peniche de Ponce and Adolfina Valencia. One of her students, Antonia Jim√©nez Trava, became the first female lawyer to graduate with a law degree in Yucat√°n in 1939. In 1948, she was awarded the Ignacio Manuel Altamirano Medal, for fifty years of educating, for her distinguished teaching career. Zavala died 22 June 1956 in M√©rida. There are six schools in Mexico that bear her name: three in the city of M√©rida, one in Akil, Yucat√°n, one in Kanas√≠n and one in Tizim√≠n.

Her thesis, for which she obtained a doctorate in 1923, was the first medical thesis written in Afrikaans. She practiced as a gynecologist, retiring in 1942. She also served in the South African medical corps during World War II.  Education and career  Van Heerden was born on 26 April 1887 in Bethlehem, South Africa. Her parents were Francois Willem van Heerden and Josephine Ryneva Beck Horak. She was the middle child with an older brother Alexander Charles and a younger brother Frankie. She was educated at the Hugenot Seminary in Wellington and Victoria College in Stellenbosch. She studied at the University of Amsterdam from 1908 to 1915 where she completed her medical degree. Van Heerden served as an intern at the Volkshuishospitaal in Bloemfontein in 1916 and had her own practice in Harrismith from 1917. She specialised in gynaecology in London from 1921 before returning to Amsterdam to complete her PhD. After obtaining her doctorate in 1923 with a thesis entitled, Die sogenamde adenioma van die ovarium (in English: The so-called adenoma of the ovary), she moved to Cape Town where she practiced as a gynaecologist. Van Heerden served in the South African medical corps during World War II and in 1942 she retired from her practice. Other interests Politics She served on the main committee of the Cape National Party in 1924 and took an active role in the dispute over the national flag. She also campaigned for women's suffrage. Archaeology In 1931 Van Heerden took part in the excavations at Wadi el Maghara at Mount Carmel in Palestine that were led by Dorothy Garrod. Publications Van Heerden published two autobiographical texts, Kerssnuitsels (1962) (Candle Snuffings) and Die sestiende koppie (1965) (the sixteenth Cup), and other works, including:Waarom Ek ‚Äòn Sosialis Is (1938) (Why I'm as Socialist), Geslagsregister van die familie Van Heerden (1969) (Family Tree of the Van Heerden Family) and Dames XVII (1969) (Ladies XVII). Van Heerden's memoirs received little academic attention until after 2000. Since then some studies have been made of her limited works. Lizelle Smit presented a masters dissertation on \\"South African Women‚Äôs Life Writing\\" in 2015 and some of the points relating to Van Heerden covered in this research are: 1) her subtle manipulations of the autobiographical content to convey important issues to Afrikaner-youth of the time; 2) her changing presentation of feminist issues and her lesbian sexual identity, especially in light of the fact that South Africa didn't accept the existence of lesbians for most of Van Heerden's life; and 3) her critique of gender inequality. Later life Van Heerden spent some of her later life after retirement working on a farm where she raised cattle. She was often seen at cattle auctions, actively participating, which was unheard of for a woman at that time in South Africa. Van Heerden never married and she died in Cape Town on 10 January 1975.

United States, known on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court as United States v. Microsoft Corp., 584 U.S. ___, 138 S. Ct. 1186 (2018), was a data privacy case involving the extraterritoriality of law enforcement seeking electronic data under the 1986 Stored Communications Act, Title II of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA), in light of modern computing and Internet technologies such as data centers and cloud storage. In 2013, Microsoft challenged a warrant by the federal government to turn over email of a target account that was stored in Ireland, arguing that a warrant issued under Section 2703 of the Stored Communications Act could not compel American companies to produce data stored in servers outside the United States. Microsoft initially lost in the Southern District of New York, with the judge stating that the nature of the Stored Communication Act warrant, as passed in 1986, was not subject to territorial limitations. Microsoft appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, who found in favor of Microsoft by 2016 and invalidated the warrant. In response, United States Department of Justice appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which decided to hear the appeal. While the case was pending in the Supreme Court, Congress passed the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act (CLOUD Act), which amended the SCA to resolve concerns from the government and Microsoft related to the initial warrant. The Supreme Court, following agreement from both the government and Microsoft, determined the passage of the CLOUD Act and a new warrant for the data filed under it made the case moot and vacated the Second Circuit's decision.  Background  As part of the investigation into a drug-trafficking case in December 2013, a United States magistrate judge in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a warrant under the Stored Communications Act of 1986 (SCA) requiring Microsoft to produce all emails and information associated with an account they hosted. While the information was held on Microsoft's United States servers, the emails were stored on a server in Dublin, Ireland, one of numerous servers Microsoft operates located around the world. Microsoft complied with providing the account information but refused to turn over the emails, arguing that a U.S. judge has no authority to issue a warrant for information stored abroad. Microsoft moved to vacate the warrant for the content held abroad on December 18, 2013. In May 2014, a federal magistrate judge, reviewing the history of the SCA (which had not been amended since its passage), disagreed with Microsoft and ordered it to turn over the emails, reasoning that unlike a typical warrant, SCA warrants function as both a warrant and a subpoena, and thus are not restricted by territorial constraints. The magistrate judge considered that Microsoft had control of the material outside the United States, and thus would be able to comply with the subpoena-like nature of the SCA warrant. Microsoft appealed to a federal District Judge. The district court upheld the magistrate judge's ruling, requiring Microsoft to provide the emails in full. Second Circuit opinion Microsoft then appealed to the Second Circuit. Several United States-based technology, publishers, and individuals submitted amicus briefs supporting Microsoft's position. The Irish government also filed a brief in support of neither party. The Irish government considered that the U.S. government's action violated both the European Union's Data Protection Directive and Ireland's own data privacy laws, and maintained the emails should be disclosed only on request to the Irish government pursuant to the long-standing mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) between the U.S. and Ireland formed in 2001; the government offered to consider such a request in an expedited manner for this case. Jan Philipp Albrecht of the European Parliament filed an amicus brief in support of Microsoft, stating that should the court grant execution of the warrant, it could \\"extend the scope of this anxiety to a sizable majority of the data held in the world‚Äôs data centers outside the U.S.\\" In the appeal to the Second Circuit, the three-judge panel unanimously overturned the lower court's ruling in July 2016, and invalided the government's warrant.Microsoft Wins Appeal on Overseas Data Searches, Nick Wingfield, Cecilia Kang, New York Times, July 14, 2016 The panel primarily focused on the extraterritoriality of the SCA, using a two-pronged test. Circuit Judge Susan L. Carney wrote the opinion of Court with District Court Judge Victor A. Bolden. Circuit Judge Gerard E. Lynch wrote a concurring opinion. The court relied heavily on the United States Supreme Court's 2010 ruling in Morrison v. National Australia Bank that the \\"longstanding principle of American law that legislation of Congress, unless a contrary intent appears, is meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States\\" applies in all cases. The Second Circuit found no mention of extraterritorial application in the SCA nor in its legislative history. The court said the SCA's use of the term \\"warrant\\", as a term-of-art, suggested a specific territory. It also concluded that the primary focus of the SCA was protecting the privacy of users of electronic services. In his concurrence, Judge Lynch noted that there was nothing in the record to indicate whether the owner of the e-mails being sought was a U.S. citizen or resident. He agreed with the government that the term \\"warrant\\" only implied the need for issuance under Fourth Amendment standards, rather than suggesting it was a search warrant with a specific place. He also noted that Microsoft chose to store the e-mails in Ireland based on the account holder's unverified statement of residence and on Microsoft's business interest in minimizing network latency. No one disputed that if Microsoft had chosen to store the emails in the U.S., the warrant would have been valid. While he agreed with the majority that the presumption against extraterritoriality, as clarified in Morrison, was decisive in this case, he did not believe it to be an optimal policy outcome and called on Congress to clarify and modernize the SCA. The U.S. government filed a petition for an en banc rehearing by the Second Circuit in October 2016. In January 2017, the full court split 4-4 on a vote to rehear the case, leaving in place the judgement in favor of Microsoft. Circuit Judge Jose Cabranes, who wrote in dissent, wrote that the held decision \\"has substantially burdened the government‚Äôs legitimate law enforcement efforts; created a roadmap for the facilitation of criminal activity; and impeded programs to protect the national security of the United States and its allies\\", and called on a higher court or the U.S. Congress to rectify the outdated language of the SCA. Separately from its appeal, the U.S. Government has had at least one other ruling in its favor, and specially against the decision of the Second Circuit Court, for similar extraterritorial requests under the SCA. In February 2017, federal magistrate judge, presiding over a District Court within the Third Circuit, ruled that Google must comply with a government warrant to turn over data from foreign servers. The magistrate judge rejected Google's reliance on the current standing from the Microsoft case, and stated in his opinion that the scope of the invasion of privacy for the case was entirely within the United States, and not where the electronic transfer of the data occurs, making the SCA warrant enforceable. Supreme Court The U.S. Department of Justice filed an appeal with the Supreme Court in June 2017. Deputy Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall argued that the Second Circuit's order has led Microsoft, Google, and Yahoo! to deny law enforcement officials with requested information stored on servers outside the United States, hampering numerous criminal investigations. The Department was joined by 33 states in support. Microsoft argued that the Court should not take the case, and instead that Congress should deal with updating the language of the outdated 1986 law. The Supreme Court granted certiorari in October 2017. The case, United States v. Microsoft Corp., was heard by the Court on February 27, 2018 with a ruling originally expected by the end of the Court's term in June 2018. While the case was being decided by the Supreme Court, Congress introduced the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act (\\"CLOUD Act\\") shortly after the oral hearings. Among other provisions, the CLOUD Act modified the SCA to specifically include cloud storage considerations of communication providers in the United States regardless of where the cloud servers may be located. The bill was supported by both the DOJ and Microsoft. In March 2018, Congress passed the CLOUD Act as part of an omnibus government spending bill, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump on March 22. By the end of March, the DOJ had issued a request for a new warrant for the original emails from the 2013 investigation under the new authority granted by the CLOUD Act, and no longer seeking resolution of the original warrant. It also requested that the Court vacate the case and remand it back to the Second Circuit, where the matter could then be rendered moot due to the passage of the CLOUD Act. Microsoft agreed with the DOJ's position. On April 17, 2018, the Court issued a per curiam opinion stating that the case was rendered moot and vacating and remanding the case back to the lower courts to dismiss the lawsuit.

At the age of 101, he was the last surviving Confederate States Army veteran from his adopted Bossier Parish. Biography Dortch was born in Claiborne County near Port Gibson in western Mississippi but came as a child to Bossier Parish, located opposite the Red River from Shreveport. As a young man, he worked in Fillmore in eastern Bossier City as a clerk for the merchant Elias Connell. Dortch's subsequent estate in southeastern Bossier Parish was known as \\"Ash Point.\\" It was twice ravaged by flooding but survived. He operated a mercantile store on his plantation. During the American Civil War, Dortch enlisted in the Bossier Volunteers, officially Company D of the 9th Regiment, commanded by General Richard Taylor, a son of Zachary Taylor.

He played a leading role in French and international pacifist organizations both before the after World War I (1914‚Äì18), and after World War II (1939‚Äì45). He was also an accomplished poet. Pre-war period Lucien Le Foyer was born in Paris on 29 June 1872. He became an advocate at the Paris Court of Appeal. Starting in 1902 the French pacifist societies began to meet at a National Peace Congress, which often had several hundred attendees. However, they were unable to unify the pacifist forces apart from setting up a small Permanent Delegation of French Pacifist Societies in 1902, led by Charles Richet (1850‚Äì1935), with Lucien Le Foyer as Secretary-General. Le Foyer was a member of the Human Rights League (LDH: Ligue des Droits de l‚ÄôHomme) as were Fr√©d√©ric Passy, leader of the Soci√©t√© des amis de la Paix and Th√©odore Ruyssen. The League did not take the strict juridical approach of the Association for Peace through Law, but promoted education about peace, material and moral disarmament, arbitrage between nations, transparency and democratic control of diplomacy. At the 1904 LDH Congress Le Foyer proposed an inalienable right of people to freely dispose of themselves as individuals. He wanted to abolish \\"collective slavery\\" and said the voice of the LDH was not just raised for Europe but also for Armenia and Macedonia, both under Turkish control at the time. On 23 May 1909 Le Foyer was elected deputy for the 2nd district of the 12th arrondissement of Paris in the second round of voting in a by-election. He sat on the left with the radical socialists. He was involved in discussions of the Hague Conference, the General Tariff and the situation of French merchants settled at Less√© on the middle Congo. He ran unsuccessfully for reelection in the general elections on 1910. An enlightened democrat, he enjoyed meeting celebrities of all political views. He remained secretary of the executive committee of the Radical party and secretary- general of the Permanent Delegation of French Pacifist Societies. On the eve of World War I (1914‚Äì18), after the Austrian declaration of war on Serbia, Henri La Fontaine called an emergency meeting in Brussels of leaders of the Bureau international de la paix (BIP) on 31 July 1914. The meeting was attended by about fifty representatives of the national societies of the Netherlands, Britain, Germany, the US, Belgium and France. Lucien Le Foyer was among the French attendees, as were Jeanne M√©lin, Th√©odore Ruyssen, Alfred Vanderpol, Gaston Moch and √âmile Arnaud. The attendees agreed to cable the governments calling for restraint. After they meeting they heard that Germany had cut rail lines on its southern border. The next day Belgium began mobilization. Post-war At the first meeting of the BIP after the war, the attendees voted for a motion proposed by Th√©odore Ruyssen that laid the blame for the war on Austria and Germany. Lucien Le Foyer was in the minority, saying the German pacifist should not be blamed. At the first post-war universal congress, in Luxembourg in 1921, the pacifists from the opposing sides were reconciled with some difficulty. Between 1914 and 1935 Le Foyer nominated various colleagues for the Nobel Peace Prize, often several times. These included L√©on Bourgeois, Madame S√©verine and Charles Richet. On 16 February 1919 Lucien Le Foyer launched the respectable \\"Cosmos\\" lodge of the Freemasons. From 1928 to 1930 he was elected Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of France. Le Foyer was not fully dedicated to pacifism, as were Robert Tourly, Madeleine Vernet and Th√©odore Ruyssen, but rather a freemason who promoted pacifism within this organization. Lucien Le Foyer remained interested in politics, and after World War II (1939‚Äì45) became president of the executive committee of the National Peace Council (Conseil national de la paix) which called for a pacifist solution to conflicts and an extension of the powers of the Assembly of the Council of Europe. For his poetic works the French Academy awarded the Prix Jules Davaine for Le Foyer's 1950 L'enchantement de l'esprit, and awarded the Prix Am√©lie Mesureur de Wally for his 1952 Le chant des choses. He died on 5 October 1952 at Saint-Germain-en- Laye, Seine-et-Oise at the age of 80.

It stars Ogletree, Joey Oglesby, Dave Sheridan, Troy Ogletree, Sophie Taylor Ali, Danielle Garcia, Andrew Pozza, and Mason Dakota Galyon as survivors of a zombie apocalypse who attempt to locate a safe haven.  Plot  A zombie outbreak is caused by a sushi chef not washing his hands before preparing a meal, gloveless, for homeless dumpster-divers. 29 days later in a hospital, a zombie named Romeo thinks to himself how zombies are slowly regaining humanity. He evades survivors Chicago (who is looking for porn) and Green Bay, who meet idiotic Sheriff Lincoln (Dave Sheridan), who has woken from a coma; his son Chris accidentally hit him with a baseball, making him misremember Chris' name. After learning LinkedIn is what's left of the internet, Lincoln decides to search for his family; Green Bay and Chicago wish him luck, revealing their group resides in the mall. Lincoln mistakes a child and her father for \\"clever zombies\\", killing them and taking their van. Romeo notices an attractive girl named Brooklyn with Green Bay and Chicago, deciding to follow her. Green Bay likes Brooklyn as well, but is too stupid to realize she hates him. Elsewhere, Super Survivor is taking out zombies. Lincoln investigates his home, finding a note from his son; they've taken shelter at his wife's workplace, a strip club. He finds Chris continued running the establishment (but is now foul mouthed). Due to stupid patrons (a parody of Shaun and Ed), a zombie bites Lincoln's wife Barbie, whom Chris kills. They head to the mall, meeting other survivors: Harlem (Brooklyn's sister, whose thoughts appear as texts) and Darnell (who thinks his toy crossbow is real, and talks about rumors). Romeo arrives as well, followed by other zombies; he saves Brooklyn, who finds him attractive, while Darnel takes out the zombies. The group reorganizes, with Lincoln and Chicago both declaring themselves leader of the \\"di-archy\\"; they order the group to pack up to head to \\"the farm\\", a haven free of zombies. They find the \\"Safe Haven\\" farm, owned by the elderly Reganites, whom the group thinks is hiding their daughter Isaac because she's a zombie. They later meet Isaac, finding her uninfected; because her parents don't have any way to keep track of the outside world, they don't know about the infection. She keeps it secret, thinking her partially-senile parents would have heartattacks. Isaac, Green Bay, Brooklyn, Chicago and Romeo get high on weed the next day, setting off fireworks that attract zombies. After Chris kills a zombie, Lincoln explains to the couple about the outbreak; however, this goes over their heads as they pay more attention to the drug use than the zombies, who they think are stoners. Harlem snaps at Darnell and Green Bay, revealing she is deaf and can read lips. Green Bay and Isaac take out zombies that make to the house, using weapons and \\"mind-blowing\\" facts. Out in the field, Darnell accidentally kills the Super Survivor, who followed the fireworks, with a gun. Anguished, Darnell ends up pinned by a zombie; Harlem shoots him in the head, sick of his idiocy. Brooklyn has Romeo bite her so they can be together, only to learn minutes later that a cure has been put in the water supply; she and Romeo spray water into their bite marks, curing them. Romeo admits that he finds Brooklyn attractive but bitchy. Using super soakers and the garden hose, the group spray the zombies with the cure; however, Lincoln still shoots live rounds at them until Chicago stops him. Later, the survivors and the cured have a party, where Chris finally kisses a happy Harlem; Chris also reverts to being kind. Romeo and Brooklyn make out, while Chicago has sex with a cured woman. Green Bay and Isaac head to her room for sex, only to hear the radio announce a meteor the size of Texas is heading to Earth.

Although reluctant to do another spoof film directly after Supernatural Activity, Nixon was able to convince him that they could turn around the spoof genre to make it more clever and be the first to lampoon The Walking Dead. The cast consists of Ogletree's brother and friends, an atmosphere he credited for making the shoot more enjoyable. Ogletree brought in director Scott Dow. Although they had collaborated on \\"business stuff\\", this was the first time they worked together on a film. Dow was fond of two scenes in particular when he read the script: an early scene in which a woman is killed, and a later scene with zombie strippers. Dow said that these scenes were very dark, but the absurd humor helped to mitigate it. He pushed for the film to be as dark as possible, as he wanted to appeal to fans of zombie films, which he knew he could not do without an MPAA \\"R\\" rating. Dave Sheridan was cast three days before production began. Making sure that there was a camaraderie on the set was important to him, as he believes that it translates in better chemistry in the film. Due to his age and experience, Sheridan had a mentor-like role on the set. Sheridan was already a fan of The Walking Dead before joining the project. One of Sheridan's friends, a collector, bought one of the hats worn by Andrew Lincoln's character Rick Grimes on the TV series. Sheridan borrowed the hat to use it on the set of The Walking Deceased. Sheridan said the film was always meant to be more of a parody than a spoof and cited iZombie as proof that zombies in popular culture had \\"jumped the shark\\". Responding to criticism of horror spoofs, Sheridan said that the film focuses primarily on character development instead of throwaway pop culture references. Sheridan also cited the cast's propensity to improvise as another way that the film was different than traditional spoofs. Filming took place in San Antonio, Texas.  Release  The Walking Deceased premiered at WalkerStalkerCon on March 15, 2015. ARC Entertainment released it theatrically on March 20, 2015.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 0% of 11 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 2.55/10. Metacritic rated it 9/100 based on four reviews. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter called it a \\"lame satire of zombie movies, whose shelf life expired even before it was made\\". Ethan Alter of Film Journal International wrote, \\"Believe it or not, this witless spoof has even less brainpower than the gray-matter-starved creatures it's ridiculing.\\" Martin Tsai of the Los Angeles Times described it as \\"a good-natured spoof\\" that parodies films too obscure for people who are not hardcore fans of the genre. Ken W. Hanley of Fangoria rated it 2.5/4 stars and wrote that although the film has many gags that fail, it is still better than studio-funded spoofs. Jim Kiest of the San Antonio Express-News wrote, \\"[S]ince the filmmakers didn‚Äôt figure out how to make separating zombies from their brains funny, but did get the blood- spurting special effects right, there are stretches when this is just another low-budget horror movie.\\" Nick Schager of The Village Voice wrote, \\"There's no more disposable type of comedy than the genre spoof, and no greater example of its general creative worthlessness than The Walking Deceased\\". Cary Darling of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram wrote, \\"Less a send-up of The Walking Dead than a misfired potshot at various zombie productions from Dawn of the Dead to Warm Bodies, it's a slop bucket of lazy writing and uninspired jokes.\\" Kiko Mart√≠nez of the San Antonio Current called it \\"a flick with zero laughs and no creative drive whatsoever\\". Drew Tinnin of Dread Central rated it 2.5/5 stars and called it \\"pretty forgettable\\" but charming.

It is located 5 km southwest of Tullamore. As of the 2016 census, the population of Mucklagh was 826 people. Amenities Mucklagh contains a number of businesses including a shop, bar, petrol station, hairdressers and nursing home. Shamrocks GAA Club is also located in Mucklagh. Places of interest Castle Gate Located at the junction of the Tullamore by-pass at Mucklagh is Castle Gate, a towered stone entrance to Charleville Estate (also known as Charleville Demesne). Beside the gate, and inside the estate's wall, are the ruins of a gate lodge which was inhabited up to the early 1970s. Marian Shrine Marian Shrine Mucklagh Located at Screggan Cross to the south of Mucklagh is the Marian Shrine. It includes walking paths and a picnic seating area. The arched stonework used to build the Marian Shrine came from the de- consecrated Church of St. Colman, Mucklagh. That building was de-consecrated in 1979 when a new Church of St. Colman was opened in September that year. The old church was demolished some years afterwards. Mill Field The Mill Field was the name given to a large field used for sports events in Mucklagh. Adjoining the field was St.Colman's National School, opened in 1953. When the school was extended in the 1980s, the section of the Mill Field fronting the main road was transferred to the school. The Mill Field was cultivated into a fine sports pitch and is now the home of Mucklagh Shamrocks GAA Club. The field got its name from a mill race which transected the field from Brocca road and extended across farmland to Charleville Estate. The mill race behind the houses between the Mill Field and Charleville Estate was closed over the 1960s/1970s. The path of the mill race is evident on the ordnance survey maps from the 1840s.  Events  Adjoining Mucklagh to the south is the townland of Screggan. The National Ploughing Championships took place in Screggan from 20-22 September 2016 with a record attendance. The event returned to Screggan again in September 2017 and 2018.

History POF-USA was founded in 2002 by aerospace engineer Frank DeSomma with the intent of solving two common problems with gas impingement systems in dusty conditions found with the traditional AR-15 which are carbon fouling and a short-barreled timing issue.

Rather than operating gas being injected directly into the upper receiver like a traditional AR-15, the technology pushes a piston that acts on an operating rod, which acts on the bolt carrier, setting extraction and reloading into motion. This action type offers several significant improvements over the direct impingement method. Because hot gases are not injected into the upper receiver, carbon fouling in the action is virtually eliminated. POF-USA's solution to timing problems related to AR-15's with short gas tubes, POF-USA developed precise op- rod/piston geometry and regulated gas pressure to enable rifles and carbines to be properly timed and bolt speeds (cyclic rates) to be precisely controlled, enhancing extraction and feeding reliability, as well as reducing wear and fatigue on critical components. The gun also runs cooler, further enhancing reliability and safety. POF-USA is an industry leader in high- performance metal finishes and coatings. POF-USA rifles feature NP3‚Ñ¢ coatings and hard, corrosion resistant, nitride heat-treated barrels and gas blocks, eliminating any requirement for lubrication. Additional innovations developed by POF-USA include the integral bolt-carrier key with the interface behind the cam pin, oversized heat-sink barrel nut, roller cam pin, and regulating gas plug.

It includes Chaozhou food in hot and cold dishes.  Background  Daa Laang originated from Chaozhou. Therefore, it is also called Chaozhou Daa Laang, which refers to the popular cold cuts and hot dishes from the food stalls in Chaozhou. Marinated food, seafood, pickled products and cooked dishes are the four main types of Daa Laang. It was then spread into Hong Kong by immigrants from Chaozhou in the 1950s. The traditional way to order the food is to choose the dish of choice in front of a waiter who would then, mark them down for customers. Your Da Laang would then be made and sent to your table. Daa Laang food would then be made and sent to their table. Because of Daa Laang's convenience and unique taste, the traditional dish is fast expanding into other parts of the country including Shenzhen.\\"ÊΩÆÊ±ïÁæéÂë≥Â§ßÊêúÁ¥¢\\", Retrieved 18 June 2012  Origins of the term  The term originated from Hong Kong, which was created in Cantonese.  Literal Connotation  * In fictions of the Song dynasty and Yuan dynasty, there were terms such as ‚ÄúÊâìÂ∞ñ‚Äù (Cantonese: daa2zim1) and ‚ÄúÊâìÂ∫ó‚Äù (Cantonese: daa2dim3), which both meant going to a restaurant for dinner while travelling. Hence, the word ‚Äúdaa‚Äù can refer to eat at a restaurant.\\" Â≠óË©ûÊ∫ØÊ∫êÔºö„ÄåÊâìÂÜ∑„ÄçËµ∑Ê∫ê\\", Retrieved 1 June 2004 * The word ‚Äúlaang‚Äù specifies Chaozhou, because it means \\"people\\" in their dialect. Thus, Guangdong People are used to call the people in Chaozhou as ‚ÄúÂÜ∑‰Ω¨‚Äù (Cantonese: laang5lou2). When they say they are going to the places of \\"Laang Lou\\" for dinner, in fact they mean going to the Chaozhou stalls.http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/supplement/food/art/20130307/18186576 Then gradually the term Daa Laang was formed at referring to dinner at Hong Kong‚Äôs Chaozhou stalls.  Influence of Teochew dialect  * In the 1950s, there were many Teochew people selling late-night supper and marinated food at Hong Kong‚Äôs streets. They used to carry baskets with poles on their shoulders, and then peddled along the streets. They were called as the ‚Äúbasket carriers‚Äù. The pronunciation of this term in Chaoshan is similar to ‚Äúdaa laang‚Äù, so then Hong Kong people call them the Daa Laangs. In the course of time, ‚ÄúDaa Laang‚Äù became the term that represents eating Teochew cuisine in Hong Kong.\\"Á≤µÊ∏ØÊæ≥ÁîüÊ¥ªÂúàÔºöÊ∏Ø„ÄåÊΩÆ„Äç‰∫∫Ê∑±Á©ó„ÄåÊâìÂÜ∑„ÄçÂêÉÂÆ∂ÈÑâÂë≥\\", Retrieved 9 January 2015 *Besides, at that period, many gangs dined and dashed at the Chaozhou stalls, then a Chaozhou gang was formed in Hong Kong to show the Chaozhou‚Äôs solidarity. Once they found someone who came for a meal, they would yell ‚Äúhit them!‚Äù to gather near- by fellows, so as to deal with these people. ‚ÄúDaa Laang‚Äù in Teochew dialect means \\"hit them\\", thus gradually people related Daa Laang and Chaozhou cuisine together.\\"ÊΩÆÊ±ïÁæéÂë≥Â§ßÊêúÁ¥¢\\", Retrieved 18 June 2012  Dishes  Different food like cattlefish, beancurd and goose pieces are cooked with marinate sauce There is usually a counter put up all the marinated food for the chef to chop when customers need to takeaway. Salt and Pepper Tofu Oyster Meat congee One must- have item for Hong Kong people to go Daa Laang is called the marinated or the Chaozhou soy-sauce goose. The marinated sauce is adjusted by every top chef in the Daa Laang so there is a slight difference between every Daa Laang. People usually order marinated tofu and cuttlefish together with the goose or directly order a marinated combination to taste the effort by the chef. Another item that Daa Laang is famous for is the pepper and salt fried food. Daa Laang usually use some light food like tofu and squid to cook with. Chef will first fry the particular food and then re-fry it with pepper and salt, and serve with chili to create a spicy and salty dish. People will also order both hot and cold food from Daa Laang, which is usually cheaper food than the food served in formal Chaozhou restaurant. For hot items, it includes oyster congee, which also adds chopped meat and dried flatfish into the congee; pan fried oyster cake, adding oyster meat into egg and fry; lemon flathead mullet, adding lemon pieces into the mullet and steam; Chinese kale and beef served with special Satai sauce, in which the Satai sauce is unique in Daa Laang. For cold items, people will order iced cockle, which the chef will boils the cockle and freeze it, then serve it with a special sauce made with garlic, sugar and vinegar; and iced crab, the chef steams the live-crab with cold water until it is boiled.  Opinions  Having congee with Daa Laang already become a popular trend of supper among Hong Kong people since 1950s. People love socializing and gathering at the Chaozhou restaurant or Dai Pai Dong after working for the whole day as the dishes are very common and affordable-a bowl of Chaozhou congee only cost a few cents of Hong Kong dollars in the past. The old and well-known Daa Laang restaurants provide good service and the waiters usually wear smile as they have already worked for many years and built a close relationship with customers.

Its originality stems from its use of regional products and from an age-old tradition, typical of the Aquitane and the Midi- Pyrenees, of cooking in fat, in particular goose and duck fat, whereas the cuisine of the south of France favours frying in oil and the cuisine of Normandy contains more dishes that are simmered or cooked in butter.

Main elements Cooked duck gizzards Landaise salad with duck gizzards, duck fillet and foie gras, asparagus etc. Landes duck breast pan-fried, in the process of cooking The cuisine of Gascony is characterised by the use of regional products such as duck fat and duck foie gras, salted ham, and the famous mild chilli of Gascony. Common condiments are Bezolles mustard, garlic, persillade, and onion. The c√®pe mushroom is frequently eaten; Tricholoma equestre was traditionally eaten but is now considered poisonous after several cases of rhabdomyolysis were linked to its consumption. Larks and the common wood pigeon are commonly eaten game birds; the ortolan, previously commonly eaten, has been a protected species since 1999. Coastal seafood includes oysters, peppery furrowshells, eel elvers, lampreys, and shad. Commonly consumed wine includes clarets (ros√©s) and tannic reds, the most important being Bordeaux wine (cabernets and merlot), but also Madiran wines (tannat and cabernets), the most tannic and well suited to the local food.

Different regions of the world and different nations have unique conceptions of which groups are considered ethnic minorities. In many Western nations where people of color (POC) are seen as ethnic minorities, homophobia that is not usually associated with the nation's dominant culture may arise as a result of that ethnic community's norms. Many LGBT ethnic minority persons rely on members of their ethnic group for support on racial matters. Within these communities, homophobia and transphobia often exist within the context of ethnocultural norms on gender and sexual orientation; one American researcher wrote; \\"a common fallacy within communities of color is that gay men or lesbians are perceived as 'defective' men or women who want to be a member of the opposite gender\\".

S. & Beach, F. A. (1951). Patterns of Sexual Behavior. New York: Harper and Row.  Theory   Intersectionality and Dual Minority Identity  Kimberl√© Crenshaw developed the framework for intersectionality, the theory that black women are not wholly defined by a singular identity, which is used in the process of examining the ways in which sexuality and race are related. Considering the ways in which their identities interact with each other and create specific experiences related to multiple intersecting identities is a better way of examining individuals and the discrimination they may deal with.Crenshaw, K. (1991). Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color. Stanford Law Review, 43(6), 1241-1299. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/1229039 Crenshaw's work also draws upon W. E. B. Du Bois' work, which refers to the fragmented understanding of self that comes with being a black American. It is applicable to understanding LGB members in racial and ethnic minority groups. Their multiple identities cause a fragmentation in which they observe themselves as queer individuals, and racial and ethnic minorities in an American culture. Du Bois called this concept double consciousness. Homophobia in ethnic minority communities creates a double bind for LGBT ethnic minorities. Members of these groups experience racial and ethnic discrimination from wider society in addition to homophobia within their ethnic/racial groups. This intersection of multiple forms of discrimination creates a triple threat for LGBT people of color. The first domain of discrimination is racism within LGBT communities which can make it hard for people who belong to an ethnic minority group to identify with the LGBT community and feel like the community is a safe space. This discrimination manifests as discrimination in social areas like bars and organizations where people of color are oftentimes excluded from the space physically and socially, and overall less likely to be welcomed. The second domain is heterosexism within ethnic communities, which is the main focus of this article. However, heterosexism within ethnic communities cannot be treated as a completely separate issue from the other forms of discrimination as many of the forms of discrimination overlap. The third form of discrimination is racism in close, same-sex relationships in which gay men of color are less-sought-out; solicitations for sex discriminate against race with phrases like \\"no rice\\" referring to no East Asian men, \\"no curry\\" which means no South Asian men, or \\"no chocolate\\" which signifies no black men. Race-based sexual stereotypes are often used within the LGBT community, which impacts potential partner choices for ethnic minority LGBT people. Black and Latino gay men are usually considered aggressive and passionate, and Asian gay men are believed to be feminine, mechanical, and reserved. These preferences are exacerbated by Internet dating sites and apps, where gay men can tailor their partner's bodily preferences according to their tastes.  Effects on health  Heterosexism in ethnic minority communities is especially harmful to the mental health of LGBT people of color, who consider their ethnic communities to be a stronger support network than LGBT communities due to racism in the latter. Abandonment by racial community that has provided support throughout childhood in dealing with external racism is feared. Due to the racial community's importance for LGBT people of color, discrimination within their own communities negatively effects mental health. If people are more dependent on their ethnic communities, they may favor their racial identity over their sexual identity. Heterosexism is thus a stressor because of the understanding of external racial oppression as well as internalized homophobia and self-hatred. Homophobia within ethnic minority communities is caused by the unique cultural practices of each ethnic minority and by the broader issue of Western, non-white discrimination. This discrimination creates the need for a supportive community to undo the psychological damage it causes.Diaz, R. M., Ph.D., Ayala, G., PsyD., Bein, E., Ph.D., Henne, J., MA, & Marin, B. V., Ph.D. (2001). The Impact of Homophobia, Poverty, and Racism on the Mental Health of Gay and Bisexual Latino Men: Findings From 3 US Cities. American Journal of Public Health, 927-932. Non-heterosexual people of color often find that neither racial community nor sexual orientation community can cater to their psychological needs since the racial community can sometimes be homophobic and the LGBT community can sometimes be racist. Minority groups find solace in support networks among themselves but clinical spaces continue to be inaccessible to LGBT-POC. When minority people experience invalidations of their experience, it becomes difficult to find necessary health services for LGBT-POC. Within the clinic, a white psychiatrist may not understand the social needs of a person of color, and spaces for dual-minority identity development are relatively lacking. Micro- aggressions within the clinic are detrimental for mental health and prevention requires additional effort from practicing counselors to be stripped of bias, informed of unique issues, and further support networks.  Effects on coming out  Heterosexism in ethnic minority communities can account for delays in the process of coming out between dominant cultures, mostly white LGBT people and LGBT people of color. LGBT people of color, on average, come out to their families and communities later than white LGBT people. White LGBT youth find it easier to come out to their families because there is a broader range of social acceptability. Since white LGBT youth can better identify with white- dominated LGBT communities, they can find an additional safe community outside of their biological family and face no fear of external societal racism. Young LGBT-POC feel the additional stigma from their own community combined with the stigma white LGBT youth face, and risking alienation from family and community means losing an important support network for POC due to the cultural oppression of racial minorities. As ethnic minorities in a mostly Western context, however, ethnic communities can sometimes be strong enough to provide some form of solace for individuals who identify as LGBT. If the oppression of the ethnic minority group is stronger in general society, homophobia from within may be more bearable than losing access to a racial community. Some other research has found heterosexism and levels of internalized homophobia are similar for both white and POC LGBT people. United States Attitudes towards sexual orientation vary throughout the United States. Social and cultural mores of sexuality have a large sociological impact on individual behavior, especially in the family unit. Many ethnic minority families in the United States do not feel comfortable discussing sexuality and disclosure of one's sexual orientation or identity often presents challenges. Many feel their coming-out may force them to be loyal to one community rather than another.Morales, Edward S. \\"Ethnic minority families and minority gays and lesbians.\\" Marriage & Family Review 14.3-4 (1989): 217-239. (Abstract) In the United States, 44% of LGBT students persons of color have reported experiencing bullying based on their sexual orientation and/or race; 13% reported physical harassment and 7% reported physical assault for the same reasons.The 2005 National School Climate Survey. Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (2005), pp. 59-60.  Black community  It has been asserted that the African American community is largely homophobic. Reasons for this include the image young, black males are expected to convey in the public sphere; that homosexuality is seen as antithetical to being black in the African American community; and the association of the African American community with the church in the United States. African Americans disagree with LGBT civil liberties more than their white counterparts; some theorize this is because of conservative churches' role in advocating for African American civil liberties and that this advocacy has expanded into the LGBT population. African American LGBT people tend to identify more with their racial/ethnic category rather than their sexual orientation as a main identity reference group. Black LGBT people are often hesitant about revealing their sexuality to their friends and families because of homosexuality's incompatibility with cultural gender roles. Thus, when black people‚Äîespecially black lesbians‚Äîcome out, family and community loyalty can provide a safety net to prevent social alienation. This familial safety net of acceptance is not full tolerance; for black lesbians, the community of \\"girlfriends\\" may grant acceptance providing there is a tacit silence about the LGBT woman's sexuality. Black people tend to express more homophobic attitudes but there is a link between education, religion, and homophobic attitudes.Harris, A. C. (2010). Sex, Stigma, and the Holy Ghost: The Black Church and the Construction of AIDS in New York City. Journal of African American Studies, 14(1), 21-43. Education has an impact on homophobic attitudes and views of sexuality within the black community. This follows a nationwide trend; more educated people are likely to be more accepting of non-heterosexual sexuality. Better education typically means less affiliation to conservative religions or denominations, which limits the influence of socially conservative ideas. Barack Obama acknowledged homophobia within the African American community and said; \\"If we are honest with ourselves, we'll acknowledge that our own community has not always been true to Martin Luther King's vision of a beloved community ... We have scorned our gay brothers and sisters instead of embracing them\\". Black advocacy groups disputed that homophobia is more prevalent in the African American community than in other groups and say surveys reflect attitudes proportionate with the rest of the population. In a 2012 survey of 120,000 adults, African Americans were more likely to self-identify as LGBT than other racial or ethnic groups in the United States. According to the data, 4.6% of African Americans identify as LGBT compared with 3.4% of the population overall. In recent years, African American celebrities such as Jason Collins, Michael Sam, and Robin Roberts have come out. The perceived bias against homosexuality in the African American community has led to the sub-cultural phenomenon \\"on the down-low\\", in which black men who identify as heterosexual secretly have sex with men. The term is also used to refer to a sexual identity. LGBT African Americans often face homophobia from heterosexual African Americans and conflict with LGBT Whites due to racism within LGBT culture. According to Margaret L. Anderson and Patricia Hill Collins, \\"The linkage between race, class, and gender is revealed within studies of sexuality, just as sexuality is a dimension of each. For example, constructing images about Black sexuality is central to maintaining institutional racism.\\" Celebrations of U.S. African-American LGBT identity include black gay pride celebrations in black-majority urban areas. Other endeavors support African- American representation in LGBT media, such as the short-lived television series Noah's Arc. = Homophobia and the Black Church = The African American church, also known as the Black Church, is a central part of Black culture. The Black Church is a combination of Protestant Christian denominations, including the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, the National Baptist Convention, and the Church of God in Christ. This link between the church and Black culture was formed during slavery; the church provided spiritual support for slaves. Religiosity helped keep slaves' morale high. When they began to plan their escape from the plantations, codes conveying secret messages about their plans were embedded into worship songs.Robert, M. L. (2007). Legacy Denied: African American Gay Men, AIDS, and the Black Church. Social Work, 52(1), 51-61. This history of the Black Church and slaves has created an indelible bond between Black Americans and the church.Douglas, K. B., & E, R. (200). Understanding the Black Church: The Dynamics of Change. Journal of Religious Thought, 56/57(2/1), 95-113. The values preached in the Black Church tend to be socially conservative, with the exclusion of ways the church addresses the homeless. In the home, so-called ‚Äútraditional‚Äù family values prevail. Maintaining a nuclear family with a man as the main provider and a woman as the staple of the house are the dominant values within the Black Church. Heterosexuality is seen as the only acceptable standard while homosexuality is seen as condemnable by God. = Homophobia and Historically Black Colleges and Universities = Historically black colleges and universities Anderson, M.

HBCUs are schools built after the American Civil war that were built to primarily serve African Americans in the south after Black students were not allowed to attend predominantly white institutions.Mobley, S., & Johnson, J. (2018). ‚ÄúNo Pumps Allowed‚Äù: The ‚ÄúProblem‚Äù With Gender Expression and the Morehouse College ‚ÄúAppropriate Attire Policy.‚Äù Journal of Homosexuality, 66(7), 867‚Äì895. https://doi.org/10.1080/00918369.2018.1486063 There were originally 121 institutions but because of funding issues, some schools have closed and there are only 101 left. On the campus of HBCUs, the Black experience is continued by creating a culture of security from opposing races by faculty, staff, and students. However, some students come against a barrier because of their intersectionality with being Black and a part of the LGBTQ+ community.Patton, L. (2011). Perspectives on Identity, Disclosure, and the Campus Environment Among African American Gay and Bisexual Men at One Historically Black College. Journal of College Student Development, 52(1), 77‚Äì100. https://doi.org/10.1353/csd.2011.0001 Some campuses have begun to make a conscious effort to end the rampant homophobia, however, that progress has been moving at an unhurried pace. Morgan State University is the first of few HBCUs to implement gender-neutral bathrooms and plans to implement a living- learning community in the future dedicated to creating gender-neutral spaces.Wood, S. (2018, Aug 09). HBCU leaders push to make their campuses more LGBTQ-inclusive. Diverse Issues in Higher Education, 35, 8. Retrieved from http://proxyau.wrlc.org/login?url=https://www-proquest- com.proxyau.wrlc.org/docview/2086278664?accountid=8285 With the push for a more inclusive environment, some are still pushing the archaic ideologies of scholarly Black men and women on their campuses. In 2009, on the campus of the famed all-male Morehouse College,Brawley, Benjamin (1917). History of Morehouse College. Atlanta: Morehouse College. pp. 135‚Äì141. Benjamin Griffith Brawley. a new dress code policy was enacted that explicitly barred students from wearing women's clothing to any sponsored University events. This was a direct response to the college's students who were feminine presenting. The purpose of the dress code policy is to promote the vision of a ‚ÄúMorehouse Man‚Äù which is a ‚Äúleader on campus and within the community.‚Äù This incident comes 6-years after a gay-bashing incident on the Morehouse campus after a mistaken sexual advanced was made by one male-student to another. Nevertheless, the college has begun to make changes to support its LGBTQ+ students and has established a task force to tackle its diversity and tolerance issues.Petrosino, F. (2003). Up Front: HBCUs Tackle Homophobia with Diversity Initiatives. The Crisis, 110(4), 10‚Äì11. The lack of visibility for the LGBTQ+ community on HBCU campuses is an issue that also permeates its halls. In a study on perspectives from LGBTQ+ students, one student noted ‚ÄúYou seldom hear the topic be addressed on gay people. I can‚Äôt recall ever hearing of an awareness week or a seminar‚Ä¶ Many at HBCUs are even taught to denounce their intersectionality and be ‚ÄúBlack first, then-Gay second.‚Äù Lewis, M., & Ericksen, K. (2016). Improving the climate for LGBTQ students at an Historically Black University. Journal of LGBT Youth, 13(3), 249‚Äì269. https://doi.org/10.1080/19361653.2016.1185761 This belief comes from the common knowledge that because one is gay, they will be discredited. The homophobia on HBCU campuses can be connected to its conservative beliefs that stem from the ideologies of the Black church. = Homophobia and AIDS in the black community = The disproportionately high incidence of HIV/AIDS among African Americans is attributed to homophobic attitudes. Black communities associate the disease almost exclusively with gay white men and not with members of their own community. Many still view HIV/AIDS as a gay disease; homophobia is one of the obstacles preventing better treatment for black people with AIDS. Irene Monroe of Huffington Post wrote; \\"while nearly 600,000 African Americans are living with HIV, and as many 30,000 newly infected each year, there is still within the black community one in five living with HIV and unaware of their infection; and, they are disproportionately heterosexuals. As long as we continue to think of HIV/AIDS as a gay disease, we'll not protect ourselves from this epidemic.\\" There is a direct link between homophobia and AIDS in the black community. The more homophobia LBGT people experience, the more likely they are to engage in unprotected anal intercourse. Studies have also found people are more likely to engage in risky sex if they strongly identify themselves with their sexuality and their race. Unprotected anal intercourse may be a mechanism used by some to cope with homophobic attitudes they face within their own community and in society. Some have said unprotected sex increases intimacy with partners and that people seek this closeness when confronted with discriminatory attitudes. Unprotected sex is used as a defense mechanism through which queer black men can deal with harsh realities.  Latino community  Homophobia in the Latino community is prevalent within the United States. As both ethnic and sexual minorities, queer Latinos may navigate contradictory identities, which Gloria Anzald√∫a calls \\"mestiza consciousness\\". \\"Borderland\\" spaces composed strictly of queer Latinos, allow them to express their sexuality without consequences.Acosta, Katie L.. \\"LESBIANAS IN THE BORDERLANDS: Shifting Identities and Imagined Communities\\".

Family gender roles in Hispanic/Latino culture are sometimes considered to be defined by clear brightlines. Oftentimes, Fathers and husbands hold power over the women in their lives; same-sex relationships disrupt the traditional role. This overt silence about sexuality may be nuanced; family identity and community are important to Hispanic/Latino families, which sometimes offer a support network despite the LGBT child's disobedience against the nuclear family. Because Latino/a LGBT people experience greater racial discrimination in broader society, primary support can come from families where they are stigmatized yet still accepted. Gay Latinos report ostracism from their friends and peers, who tell them they are \\"not truly 'men'.\\"Diaz and Ayala. Social Discrimination and Health: The Case of Latino Gay Men and HIV Risk. National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Policy Institute (2001), p. 9. Community attitudes treat male homosexuality as \\"dirty, shameful and abnormal\\", and Latina lesbians are stereotyped as traitors who have forsaken their roots.Torres, Lourdes. \\"Becoming Visible: US Latina Lesbians Talk Back and Act Out.\\" Counterpoints 169 (2002): 151-162. Cherr√≠e Moraga said Chicana lesbians are perceived as Malinche figures who are corrupted by foreign influences that contribute to the \\"genocide\\" of their people, even if they have children.de Alba, Alicia Gaspar. \\"\\"tortillerismo\\": Work by Chicana Lesbians\\". Signs 18.4 (1993): 956‚Äì963. These stigmas are historically ingrained into Latino cultures; Latina lesbians who have spoken to their families about their sexuality still feel they are silenced. A Green Heritage News editor stated homophobia in the Latino community is tied to a value system that finds it difficult to accept overt sexuality. It is also a part of rigid gender roles and machismo. This has influenced many people with HIV/AIDS to avoid being tested for the disease in the Hispanic community. Covert homophobia in the use of terms such as that's so gay and no homo are also common. Toronto Blue Jays shortstop Yunel Escabar was banned from playing after writing the phrase tu eres maric√≥n on his eye tape (Spanish for \\"you are a faggot\\"). Hector Conteras, a DJ, \\"prompted listeners via Twitter to denounce what they considered 'gay behavior' from their peers at work, school, their neighborhood or within their own family\\". In the U.S., Latino/a children who identify as LGBTQ face scrutiny from their community at home and in schools, especially within a high school or college preparation experience. While facing scrutiny from family and community to maintain gender normality to prosper in the U.S., they also face scrutiny from their peers, mentors and educational administrators. This scrutiny includes a lack of acceptance and recognition as a separate educational entity within sexual education programs provided by many high school education districts. Latinas are viewed as needing to have less interest in sexual education while Latinos are told to maintain focus and to take the education seriously. When teachers are prompted to explain sexual education for lesbians or gays, the teachers or educators assume the student body to be uniformly heterosexual and refuse or consider the questions immature and outside the scope of their teaching.Garcia, L. \\"\\"Now Why Do You Want to Know about That?\\": Heteronormativity, Sexism, and Racism in the Sexual (Mis)education of Latina Youth.\\" Gender & Society 23.4 (2009): 520-41. Web. 3 Dec. 2016. LGBT discrimination has a negative impact on the mental health of Latino/as; LGBT Latinas, however, experience less homophobia than their male contemporaries. This can be attributed to socialization that condemns same-sex male relationships more harshly than same-sex female relationships. Men experience more internalized homophobia than Latina women, which impacts their well-being.Herek, G. M., Ph.D., Cogan, J. C., Ph.D., Gillis, J. R., Ph.D., & Glunt, E. K. (1997). Correlates of Internalized Homophobia in a Community Sample of Lesbians and Gay Men. Journal of the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association, 17-25. Retrieved September 14, 2018. For Latino/as, creating environments that enable LGBT individuals to be themselves without fear of judgement is necessary for overall health. Implementing programs that empower LGBT Latinos is an effective measure in the prevention of HIV. Self- identification also needs to be observed; if a person identifies strongly as both queer and Latino, that impacts their overall feeling of well-being. Strong self-identification with marginalized groups can contribute to internalized homophobia.  Asian American and Pacific Islander community  Homophobia in the Asian American community is an ongoing issue. One study found approximately 90% of Asian and Pacific Islanders (APIs) who self- identified as LGBT thought homophobia or transphobia is an issue in the API community. Homosexuality is sometimes considered a mental disorder in many Asian countries of origin; shock therapy, public shaming, or other denigrating methods are sometimes used in an attempt to rid someone of homosexuality.Ruan, F. & Tsai, Y.(1988). Male homosexuality in contemporary Mainland China. Archives of Sexual Behavior. 17.189-199. According to Amy Sueyoshi, \\"Voices from the queer left, though opposed to homophobia in cultural nationalism, have picked up the protest against the feminization of Asian American men in the gay community\\".The sources Sueyoshi gives for this statement are: *David Eng, Racial Castration: Managing Masculinity in Asian America (Durham: Duke University Press, 2001); *Richard Fung, \\"Looking For My Penis: The Eroticized Asian in Gay Video Porn \\" in Q&A;: Queer in Asian America (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1998), pp. 115‚Äì135 While having different perspectives, both groups support a phallocentric standard of Asian American male sexuality.\\"Han, C. (2008). A Qualitative Exploration of the Relationship Between Racism and Unsafe Sex Among Asian Pacific Islander Gay Men. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 37(5), 827-837. = Cultural expectations = Homophobia in the Asian American/Pacific Islander community can be prevalent due to cultural expectations that some members of the community hold. These cultural expectations are not universal or uniform, but may help explain why some LGBT Asian Americans feel homophobic pressure from their ethnic communities. Some Asian Americans and first-generation Asian immigrants consider homosexuality to be Western in nature, especially since the concept of \\"gay identity\\" is a term coined in the Western world.Grahn, J. (1984). Another Mother Tongue. Boston, MA: Beacon Press. A large percentage of Asian languages do not have a specific word describing homosexuality, gay, lesbian, etc., but rather several stand-in terms that roughly reference one's sexuality. Due to lacking specific terminology for certain concepts, there often is little to no frame of reference for understanding the dynamic of same-sex sexual relationships. The attempted explanation of gay identity to one's community creates a language barrier between the community and the LGBT member where the LGBT person has difficulty explaining their sexual orientation to their family and community members, exacerbating the lack of understanding and cultural rift between supposedly Western conceptions of homosexuality and heterosexism.Chan, C.S.(1995) Issues of sexual identity in an ethnic minority: The case of Chinese American lesbians, gay men, and bisexual people. In A. D'Augelli & C. Patterson (Eds.), Lesbian, gay. and bisexual identities over the lifespan (pp. 87-101). New York: Oxford University Press. Homosexuality is considered to not be associated with Asian cultures, especially in Japanese culture which operate with limited gender roles. However, it was romanticized in Chinese culture, embraced by the people so long, until the establishment of the PRC which demolished such bondage. Thus, when LGBT Asian American children try to explain their gay identity to their parents, it often can be unsuccessful since there is no equivalent concept in Asian culture. Even in Western understandings, Asian American LGBT people find little to no representation. Coming out and continual assertion of gay identity is viewed as a rejection of fundamental Asian cultural values; due to the belief that homosexuality is a Western concept, LGBT children become sources of familial shame for Asian American and Asian immigrant mothers.Choi, K.H., Salazar, N., Lew, S., & Coates, T.J. (1995). AIDS risk, dual identity, and community response among gay Asian and Pacific Islander men in San Francisco. In G. M. Herek & B. Green (Eds.), AIDS, identity, and community: The HIV epidemic and lesbian and gay men. V. 2. (pp. 115-134). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. Verbal openness and communication in Asian American families is often considered to be restrained in comparison to white families. Non-verbal cues and indirect high-context communication are valued by Asian American families.Uba, L. (1994). Asian Americans: Personality patterns, identity, and mental health. New York: The Guilford Press. As a part of acculturating to Western society, second- generation Asian Americans start to use more English and speak less of their parents' language, which makes deeper discussion of issues between generations more difficult.Lee, E. (1997). Chinese American families. In E. Lee (Ed.). Working with Asian Americans: A guide for clinicians (pp. 46-781). New York: The Guilford Press. This can lead to pushing back discussions about sex and relationships, which gives Asian American children a late start in comparison to their peers.Wong, L.,& Mock, M. (1993). Developmental and life cycle issues of Asian Americans: Asian American young adults. Unpublished manuscript. The overall lower amount of open communication compounds difficulties in expressing identity to their community. Oftentimes, sexual shame accompanies any discussion of sexual orientation. Actively and openly pursuing sexual desires are often discouraged regardless of sexual orientation; however, this effect is exacerbated for LGBT Asian American children and makes it incredibly difficult to come out to family members.Nagata, D.K.(1989). Japanese-American children and adolescents. In J. Gibbs, L. Huang, & Associates (Eds.), Children of color (pp. 42- 60). San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass.Liu, P. & Chan, C.S.(1996). Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Asian Americans and their families. In J. Liard, & R.J. Green (Eds.). Lesbians and gavs in couples and families: A handbook for therapists (pp. 137-152). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass. Those who belong to Asian cultures may feel that sex is a taboo topic that should not be discussed in detail, and view discussions about sexuality and sexual orientation to be shameful.Leong, R. C. (Ed.) (1996). Asian American sexualities: Dimensions of the gay and lesbian experience. New York: Routledge. Asian immigrant parents often feel that nobody else in the community would understand their child's sexuality, and thus prefer to avoid the topic of sexual orientation altogether.Kahn, A.D.(Ed.). (1997). The many faces of gay: Activists who are changing the nation. Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers. The family will oftentimes refuse to acknowledge their sexual orientation even if they have previously discussed it with their family members.Chan, C.S. (1989). Issues of identity development among Asian- American lesbians and gay men. Journal of Counseling and Development. 68,16-20. Filial piety is also considered another potential reason for why Asian Americans experience homophobia within their ethnic community. Asian immigrant parents may carry cultural values from their country of origin, including Confucian ideals of filial piety for the eldest son to carry on the family name, care for the parents as they grow old, and respect their ancestors. However, each family is different based on generation of immigrant as well as level of acculturation to \\"Americanized\\" views, so level of adherence to traditional values may differ. LGBT Asian American children are viewed as unable to carry on the family name if they are solely attracted to the same-sex and choose not to have children. These traditional values also affect whether or not the child chooses to disclose sexual identity and how the family responds to their child's disclosure.Aoki, B. (1997). Gay and lesbian Asian Americans. In E. Lee (Ed.), Working with Asian Americans: A guide for clinicians (pp. 411- 419). New York: The Guilford Press. Unique challenges arise from the Asian American LGBT experience when being gay is considered a form of social deviance that brings shame to the family name for the cultural reasons listed above, making it more difficult to come out to Asian Americans than to other Americans. Sexual orientation disclosure is not an openly celebrated event, and once Asian American children do come out, their parents often believe that their homosexuality is a result of their particular parenting choices, and may shame themselves for not \\"correcting\\" their children in an early age.Horn, A.Y. (1992). Family matters: A historical study of the Asian Pacific lesbian network. Unpublished master's thesis, University of California, Los Angeles, CA. = Internalized homophobia = The expectations placed on Asian American LGBT people can oftentimes lead to internalization of homophobic attitudes or reluctance to embrace their sexual orientation. If an Asian American LGBT person felt more culturally adherent to Asian country of origin values, they are more likely to experience internalized heterosexism and were less likely to disclose sexual identity to others in comparison to those who did not adhere as much to traditional values. Family-oriented and socially-oriented identity interact with internalized heteronormativity; these three factors influence one's choice to come out or enter a straight marriage. Managing internalized homophobia in order to keep feelings of inadequacy away includes tactics that respond to external oppression from the Asian American community and from LGBT communities. Some respond to stigma by attempting to pass for straight or continually cover their orientation to avoid discrimination; if family members have been told about sexual orientation, they may simply choose to not discuss the issue and act as if the person is not homosexual.Dang, A., & Hu, M. (2005). Asian Pacific American lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people: A community portrait. A report from New York's Queer Asian Pacific Legacy Conference, 2004. New York, NY: National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Policy Institute. In the cases of some gay Asian men, they respond to stigmatized status by re-appropriating and destigmatizing assumptions of excessive femininity compared to other gay men. Some may also redefine homophobia within the Asian American community as being a Western ideal; if homophobia is framed as not truly being a part of Asian beliefs, gay Asian Americans can reclaim their Asian authenticity. However, some studies have found that there are no significant differences for the amount of internalized homophobia Asian American LGBT people experience. = Acceptance = Similarly to other ethnic minorities in the US, the dual minority identity may make a family support network more important to maintain than disowning a child. Yet in Asian American cultures, there is often a lesser degree of overt expression of love, which can affect the parent-and-child relationship after disclosing a non-straight sexual identity. If an Asian American family feels their familial ties are strong, coming out does not represent a permanent split but rather a shift towards a new form of embracing the homosexual family member. This form of acceptance can help LGBT people feel more comfortable in their own identity.Savin-Williams, R.C.(1989 a). Coming out to parents and self-esteem among gay and lesbian youth.

United Kingdom In the UK, among all racial groups, there is a widespread assumption that being gay is a phenomenon limited to white people.Cahill, S, Battle, J and Meyer, D (2003) Partnering, parenting, and policy: Family issues affecting Black lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people, Race and Society, 6: 85‚Äì98. It has been suggested that this means many Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) people's healthcare needs are not being met, and this could be dangerous, because LGBT BME people's needs may differ to those of white LGBT people. BME LGBT communities are disproportionately affected by homophobic violence, abuse and harassment. A study conducted in London found BME LGBT people are more likely to experience physical abuse and harassment from a stranger, and were equally likely to have experienced verbal abuse as their White British LGBT counterparts.Galop (2001) The Low Down: Black lesbians, gay men and bisexual people talk about their experiences and needs, Galop, London. Because of the pressures of discrimination and victimization, BME LGBT Britons are more likely to have poor mental health.Mays, VM and Cochran, SD (2001) Mental health correlates of perceived discrimination among lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults in the United States, American Journal of Public Health, 91(11): 1869‚Äì76.  Black British community  Homophobia in the Black British community is prevalent. In the UK, many gay people in the black community get married or have partners of the opposite sex to hide their sexual orientation. In the Black community, hate music against LGBT people has been composed; campaigns such as Stop Murder Music have tried to counteract this, although they have had little success in lessening homophobia within the Black British community. Some have regarded this and other anti-homophobia efforts aimed at the Black British community as racist, which makes many social critics reluctant to criticise homophobia in the Black community. Some members of the Black British community see homosexuality as a \\"white disease\\". Many Black British gay people face being socially isolated from their communities and the possibility of being assaulted or murdered.  British Asian community  Those who speak on behalf of BME communities sometimes reinforce conservative attitudes towards sexual orientation; this is experienced as oppressive by many British South Asian LGBT people. Patrick McAleenan wrote in The Telegraph that \\"homophobia taints the British Asian community\\" and that the \\"opposition to a gay lifestyle [is] still strong amongst the British Asian community\\". Balaji Ravichandran commented in The Guardian that while \\"in the south Asian diaspora, being gay is often deeply taboo\\"; he also believes the \\"gay community should help south Asians\\", pointing to the perceived racism of White British gay men. , the joint Foreign and Commonwealth Office and British Home Office Forced Marriage Unit noted a 65% increase in forced marriages among primarily British Asian men. Many in the British Asian community who contacted the FMU were put into forced marriages because their families suspected they were gay or bisexual.

She is well known for the large scale interior Supergraphics and exterior signage at Sea Ranch in Sonoma County, California. Early life and education Barbara Stauffacher was born in 1928 as a third- generation San Franciscan. As a young woman Solomon studied and worked as a dancer, as well as studying painting and sculpture at San Francisco Art Institute. In 1948 she married Frank Stauffacher. Solomon moved to Basel, Switzerland in 1956 after Stauffacher's death to study graphic design at the Basel Art Institute with Armin Hofmann from 1956 to 1959. She made the decision to study design because she knew she could make a living and needed to support herself and her small child. She later studied Architecture at the University of California, Berkeley. She remarried in 1969 to Daniel Solomon, an architect and professor. Career Solomon returned to San Francisco in 1962 and set up an office as a graphic designer where she designed the monthly program guides for the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. She met landscape architect Lawrence Halprin who gave her work at Sea Ranch in 1968, where she designed the architectural scale paintings for the building interiors, due to her educational background. Her work at Sea Ranch grew from her vocabulary of signs to create motion and an awareness of space. She created the logo for Sea Ranch that was a cross between Swiss design and California impressionalism to interpret the property's rams and crashing waves. Halprin went on to recommend her to other architects in the San Francisco area who let her design what she wanted. She went on to receive two American Institute of Architects (AIA) awards for her work at Sea Ranch. Solomon was an instructor at Harvard University and Yale University, where she was invited by Charles Moore, whom she had met while working at Sea Ranch, to lead a studio on supergraphics in 1968.Robert A.M. Stern and Jimmy Stamp, Pedagogy and Place: 100 Years of Architectural Education at Yale (Yale University Press, 2016) The studio was a week-long project creating two-dimensional graphics that reinforced the architecture of Yale University's Art and Architecture elevators. It was wildly successful and herald by Ada Louise Huxtable as a protest against the Establishment. In the short period of its existence from 1970 until 1971 she was art director of Scanlan's Magazine.

Association football, more commonly referred to as football and also known as soccer, is a sport played world-wide, with up to 265 million people around the world participating on a yearly basis. Kicking is one of the most difficult skills to acquire in football. This skill is also vitally important, as kicking is the way in which passes are made and the primary means by which goals are scored.Dooley, Thomas, and Christian Titz. Soccer: Perfect Shooting Techniques. Maidenhead: Meyer &Meyer; Sport, 2012. Print. It has been observed that the time in which kicking skill develops most rapidly in the young football player is between the ages of 4 and 6 years old, with a consistent progression in ability up to the age of ten.Barfield, W. (n.d.). The Biomechanics Of Kicking In Soccer. Clinics in Sports Medicine, 711‚Äì728. Retrieved February 18, 2015. This indicates that early participation in football can have long-term implications for the future ability level of the association football player. Greater accuracy and ability is seen in elite football players, likely due to the decreased mechanical variability in their form, highlighting the importance of practice in order to increase consistency in executing proper form. Technique Approach There are two main aspects of the kicking action to consider when developing the skills for an effective kick in football: power (velocity of the ball) and accuracy (trajectory of the ball).Katis, A., Giannadakis, E., Kannas, T., Amiridis, I., Kellis, E., & Lees, A. (2013). Mechanisms that influence accuracy of the soccer kick. Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology, 125‚Äì131. Retrieved February 10, 2015, from PubMed. Multiple studies have concluded that a diagonal approach is more effective than a straight approach, with an approach angle close 45 degrees yielding the greatest power and ball velocity. Athletes with stronger and more accurate kicks and tend to put less energy into the approach (the steps taken before the kick) and more energy into the backswing and forward swing movements of the kick than do less skilled athletes. Therefore, less focus should be placed on the approach and more focus placed on developing effective kicking mechanics. Visual focus Visual focus should be placed on the ball, not on the football pitch. If lifting the head/eyes in order to determine where to shoot, which may be necessary in various circumstances, this should be done before taking the shot. The athlete‚Äôs vision should be focused directly at the ball through the entirety of the kicking action in order to increase accuracy. Support (stance) leg Just prior to the swing phase, the athlete should land on the supporting leg with the knee slightly flexed so as to absorb some of the impact and thereby stabilize the body for more effective motion of the kicking leg.Katis, A., Giannadakis, E., Kannas, T., Amiridis, I., Kellis, E., & Lees, A. (2013). Mechanisms that influence accuracy of the kick. Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology, 125‚Äì131. Retrieved February 10, 2015, from PubMed. The best position of the supporting leg has been found to be 5 to 10 cm to the side of the ball (left of the ball for a right-footed kicker, right of the ball for a left-footed kicker). Skilled athletes have a tendency toward a closer ball-to-support leg side position. For forward to back positioning, there is variability based on the desired action of the ball. Placing the support leg further behind the ball will produce a greater upward direction whereas placing the support leg closer to the ball will produce greater forward propulsion. Ball flight trajectory is dictated by the supporting foot‚Äôs position. The support foot should be positioned so as to be parallel to the intended direction of the ball.Wolfe, I. (2014, February 19). How to Shoot an Accurate Shot in Soccer. Retrieved February 12, 2015. Other important body positioning to be aware of is to bend the upper body slightly forward over the ball. Foot/ball contact Velocity of the football is dependent on both the velocity of the foot upon contact as well as the quality of contact between the foot and the ball.Kellis, E., & Katis, A. (2007). Biomechanical Characteristics and Determinants of Instep Soccer Kick. Journal of Sports Science and Medicine. Retrieved February 12, 2015, from PubMed. The most effective way to transfer speed to the ball is to hit the ball at its center point with the upper portion of the foot, keeping the ankle firm.Kellis, E. and Katis, A. (2007). Biomechanical characteristics and determinants of instep football kick. Journal of Sports Science and Medicine, 6: 154‚Äì165. Motions and muscles Lower body movement analysis and joint motions are important to learn because of the involvement in the kick. An in-step football kick involves a performer striking the football with the dorsal (top) part of the foot. The various lower body muscles that are required for this motion are also analyzed. Movement analysis Six distinct stages are involved in the kick: the approach angle, the plant foot force, the swing limb loading, the swinging phase, ball contact, and the follow through. The first is the ‚Äúapproach angle‚Äù when a kicker runs up to the ball. The second stage is the plant foot force, which involves situating the supporting foot at a distance lateral from the ball prior to kicking. The third stage is the swing limb loading that requires the preparation of the hip flexors and knee extensors to load or eccentrically stretch for forward movement in order for the swinging limb to strike the ball. It is also known as the backswing phase. The fourth stage is when the hip flexors and knee extensors initiate a forceful contraction in the swinging limb at a high velocity towards the ball. This stage is considered the swinging phase. The fifth stage is when the swinging foot makes complete contact with the ball. Lastly, once the foot makes impact, the kicker should try to keep their foot in contact with the ball as long as they can. This is possible by proceeding with the swing of the limb until ball is out of contact. This stage is also known as the follow through phase. Joints Joint motions are focused on the lower extremities; although there is recognition of upper body joint movements during the kick. Starting in stage 3, the kicking limb moves posterior of the positioned body, which is possible with hip extension. The hip is also adducted and externally rotated with knee flexion, knee internal rotation, and slight plantar flexion at the ankle joint on the kicking leg to prepare for impact with the ball. When the kicking foot comes into contact with the ball, hip goes into flexion, abduction, and external rotation with knee at a slight constant flexion. The pelvis rotates around the supporting limb by raising the thigh of the kicking limb forward. Forward motion is initiated by rotating the pelvis around the supporting leg and by bring the thigh of the kicking leg forwards while the knee continues to flex. During the last stages (stage 5 and 6) of the kick, the kicking foot exhibits plantar flexion at the ankle joint when coming into contact with the ball.Lees, A., Asai, T., Andersen, T.B., Nunome, H., & Sterzing, T. (2010). The biomechanics of kicking in soccer: A review. Journal of Sports Sciences, 28(8): 805‚Äì817. Throughout each stage of the kick, the supporting limb knee is at a constant flexion. It is required to ‚Äúabsorb the impact of landing‚Äù and helps with reducing the forward motion. Once the kicking limb is near contact with the ball, the supporting knee initiates extension to stabilize the action. Prior to contact with the ball, there is a lateral flexion between the supporting limb and the trunk of the performer. Muscles Both the gluteus medius and gluteus maximus have greater activity in the kicking leg during the foot planting stage (Stage 2) preparing to raise the leg posterior of the body.Brophy, R., Backus, S., Pansy, B., Lyman, S., and Williams, R. (2007). Lower Extremity Muscle Activation and Alignment During the Soccer Instep and Side-foot Kicks. Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy, 37(5): 260‚Äì268. During the backward swing in stage 3, the hamstrings (bicep femoris, semimembranosus, and semitendinosus) are activated to flex the knee and extend the hip in the swinging limb. Hamstrings are also activated in the supporting limb throughout the swinging stages until foot comes into contact with the ball to allow stabilization and balance. Stabilizer muscles, such as the gluteus medius and psoas, on the supporting limb are active to prevent the hip from adducting. As the kicking limb begins forward movement in stage 4, quadriceps, hip flexor muscles (iliopsoas), knee extensor muscles including the rectus femoris creates concentric activity to produce a fast forward velocity toward the ball by extending the knee and flexing the hip. During the swing stage prior to contact of the ball in stage 5, there is greater activation of the rectus femoris and the vastus medialis that may contribute to final knee extension speed.Manolopoulos, E., Katis, A., Manolopoulos, K., Kalapotharakos, V., and Kellis, E. (2013). Effects of a 10-Week Resistance Exercise Program on Soccer Kick Biomechanics and Muscle Strength. Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, 27(12): 3391‚Äì3401. Also during the swinging limb stages, the gluteus medius has a greater activation in the supporting limb to allow rotation of the hip. In the follow- through phase (Stage 6), the gluteus maximus is activated in the kicking limb and during the leg cocking stage in the supporting limb to allow rotation of the hip. The gastrocnemius exhibited greatest muscle activity in the kicking leg during all stages of the motion, although it exhibited greatest muscle activity in the supporting limb in the swinging limb loading and the swinging limb stages (Stages 3 and 4, respectively), when the leg is cocked back and accelerates forward towards the ball. Targeted exercises for each muscle involved in a free kick A football kick is the basic element of a game of association football. It is a multi-joint movement that involves coordination of primarily muscles of the leg and hip as well as other stabilizing and neutralizing muscles. A successful football kick requires a combination of power and accuracy and depending on the technique, it can either be powerful or accurate. A greater ‚Äúswing phase‚Äù or foot speed will produce more power relying in force and speed, and the position of the ‚Äúplanted‚Äù foot and hip at impact will produce greater accuracy in the direction of the kick. Kicking performance can be improved by practicing and training soccer-specific strength exercises.Manolopoulos, E., C. Papadopoulos, and E. Kellis. \\"Effects of Combined Strength and Kick Coordination Training on Soccer Kick Biomechanics in Amateur Players.\\" Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports (2004): 102‚Äì10. Print. This multi articular movement is executed by segmental and joint torques in multiple planes and produces and angular velocity generated from proximal to distal limbs.Kellis, Eleftherios, and Athanasios Katis. \\"Biomechanical Characteristics and Determinants of Instep Soccer Kick.\\" ¬©Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 6 (2007): 154‚Äì65. Print These are some exercises for each muscle involved in a free kick that will improve balance, force and speed. These are functional exercises that can be done on the field in practice. Trunk The muscles of the trunk stabilize the body before, during, and after impact with the ball during the kick (Major muscles involved; rectus abdominis, psoas major, and erector spinae muscles). The spider Crawl is a dynamic compound exercise that works mainly the core muscles such as rectus abdominis, erector spinae, and external obliques as well as the pectoralis major, anterior deltoids, and triceps. The spider crawl exercise aids in improving coordination by contra-laterally activating and coordinating the upper body with the lower body muscles. Moreover, crunches help to strengthen the rectus abdominis muscle and variations of planks engage the erector spinae and deeper back extensor muscles that aid in improving balance and posture. The superman exercise strengthens the lower back and improves flexibility in the lumbar region. Hip The hip involves flexion and internal rotation on the kicking leg side (tensor fasciae latae, rectus femoris, psoas major, iliacus, sartorius, pectineus, adductor brevis, longus, and magnus), and extension on the ‚Äúplanted‚Äù leg side (gluteus maximus, hamstring group and adductor magnus. The side lunge increases strength of the quadriceps muscles, gluteus maximus, and hip adductors & flexors. The side lunge improves balance by putting the body weight on the planted leg while trying to prevent falling back or forward. In addition, cariocas is an exercise in which the person moves laterally while facing forward by internally rotating the hip and stepping over with the leg contralateral to the direction of the movement. This exercise improves hip flexibility and agility by rotating the hip and stepping over quickly. Legs The hip extends and knee flexes during the loading of swing phase and then during the latter part of swing phase the leg flexes on the hip and knee extends while plantar flexing the ankle to kick the ball. (Quadriceps group, hamstrings group and plantar flexors). Jumping squats are a plyometric exercise that improves force, speed which equals power and explosiveness on the legs. Mountain climbers are a great way to improve endurance due to the duration and high intensity nature of the exercise. In addition, Nordic hamstring curls are important to reduce the development of muscle imbalance and prevent injuries because the hamstring muscles are often neglected and injured during an explosive movement such as the soccer kick. Most importantly, sprints will improve speed, force, agility, and endurance because it requires explosiveness and coordination of the body segments. Upper body The shoulder contralateral to the kicking leg is horizontally adducted and aids in counterbalancing the kick (anterior deltoid, biceps brachii, pectoralis major). For a football kick the upper body is not very active, but keeping a balance between the upper and lower body will reduce the torques created by forces of other segments.

The accident killed eight climbers‚Äîincluding four from the Hall expedition‚Äîand remained the worst climbing accident on Everest until the 2014 Mount Everest avalanche. The book features 55 illustrations by Jane Cardinal and was published in 2014 by Good Hart Publishing. Overview Although he wrote the book in the aftermath of the tragedy, Kasischke waited 16 years to release After the Wind. The book focuses on the events leading up to the ascent, Kasischke‚Äôs experiences on the mountain, and his motivation for turning around 400 feet from the summit, as well as the close relationship he shares with his wife, Sandy. Using the analytical skills acquired from his many years as a corporate attorney, Kasischke also offers a fresh analysis of how the tragedy unfolded and the decisions‚Äîboth individual and collective‚Äîthat contributed to it. Though Kasischke avoids blaming any single person for the tragedy, he does note that the presence of journalist Jon Krakauer may have caused guide Rob Hall, whose Adventure Consultants business was in competition with Scott Fischer‚Äôs Mountain Madness, to take uncharacteristic risks on the mountain in an effort to get as many clients as possible to the summit and subsequently receive favorable press from Krakauer's report.

Sturdy competed at the 1928 U.S. Olympic Trials, but failed to qualify for the Olympics in Amsterdam; the United States had the best pole vaulters in the world, and track historian Richard Hymans wrote that both Sturdy and Stanford's Ward Edmonds, who also failed to qualify, \\"would have been automatic selections for any other country.\\" The American team of Carr, Barnes, Bill Droegemueller and Charles McGinnis swept the medals at the Olympics. With Carr graduating before the 1929 season, Sturdy became Yale's new top vaulter. At the New York Athletic Club games in Madison Square Garden on February 18, 1929, he vaulted 14 feet (4.26 m), becoming only the second man (after Carr) to clear that height indoors; he took three attempts at 14 ft in (4.30 m), which would have been a new world record, but failed. Later that winter, Sturdy won ahead of decathlete Barney Berlinger at both the IC4A and national (AAU) indoor championships; his IC4A winning mark, 13 ft in (4.15 m), broke Carr's meeting record from the previous year. Sturdy remained in good shape outdoors, again winning both the AAU and IC4A titles; in the IC4A meet he shared first place with Edmonds and USC's Jack Williams, as all three cleared at 13 ft 9 in (4.19 m) and there was no jump-off. He won the AAU championship outright, clearing 13 ft in to improve the meeting record set at the previous year's Olympic Trials by a quarter-inch. After graduating in 1929 Sturdy competed for the Los Angeles Athletic Club, although he stayed at Yale for postgraduate education. During the 1930 indoor season he injured his leg and his shape for the AAU indoor championships was considered doubtful, but he successfully defended his title, defeating Northwestern's Tommy Warne in a jump-off after both had cleared 13 ft 9 in to tie for first. Sturdy also repeated as AAU outdoor champion, again after a jump-off against Warne; he won the jump-off by default after Warne sprained his ankle and conceded the title. Sturdy won two more AAU indoor titles in 1931 and 1932; his 1931 winning mark, 13 ft 11 in (4.24 m), was his best since the 14-foot jump in February 1929. At the 1932 Olympic Trials in Palo Alto Sturdy cleared 13 ft 10 in (4.22 m), which was his outdoor lifetime best; however, it only placed him in a four-way tie for third. After a jump-off, third place (and the final Olympic qualifying spot) went to UCLA's George Jefferson, and Sturdy was again left out of the team.

History Satire on cross-dressing, around 1780 Britain Gender roles in non-heterosexual communities have been the subject of debate in Western society. Peter M. Nardi of Pitzer College says: > The connection between sexual orientation and gender roles has been confused > by many people. Too often, assumptions about homosexuality or > heterosexuality have led to assumptions about masculinity or femininity ... > Understanding the differences between sexual identity and gender roles is > enhanced when focusing on the issues of friendship and sex among gay men. > For many people, being gay has been interpreted in terms of not being > masculine or, more specifically, being seen as feminine. According to human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell: > Queers subvert the gender system. Gay men love males and are not adequately > macho and aggressive. Lesbians love women and are insufficiently passive and > dependent on men. That's why we're persecuted. Our nonconformity threatens > the system which sustains the social hegemony of male heterosexuality and > misogyny. This has been described as \\"gender fuck politics\\". Havelock Ellis and Sigmund Freud thought homosexuality resulted from reversed gender roles. Most modern scientists accept there is no strong evidence that a homosexual or bisexual orientation must be associated with atypical gender roles. Many factors have been linked to homosexuality, including genetic factors, anatomical factors, birth order, and hormones in the prenatal environment.King, B. (2009). Human Sexuality Today (Sixth ed.). Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, Inc. Terms such as butch, are used within the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT), and cross-dressing subcultures to ascribe or acknowledge a masculine identity with its associated traits, behaviours, styles, and self-perception. Gay and bisexual communities Although many bisexual and pansexual people may consider themselves \\"gender blind\\",Woolley, Susan W. \\"\\"The Silence Itself is Enough of a Statement\\": Unintended Consequences of Silence as an Awareness- Raising Strategy.\\" Institute for the Study of Social Change (2010). writers on bisexual issues often disagree with the idea that bisexuals make a conscious decision to disregard socially-constructed gender roles. Women The application of the traditional \\"man\\" and traditional \\"woman\\" in lesbian relationships is common, as with gay male relationships. Most often in lesbian relationships, there will come a point when someone asks the question: \\"So which one's the guy?\\", even if no males are involved in the relationship. This is believed to stem from heteronormative and patriarchal setups of traditional heterosexual relationships. Men Dr. Joseph Pleck says the hierarchy of masculinities among men exist largely in a dichotomy of homosexual and heterosexual males, and says, \\"our society uses the male heterosexual- homosexual dichotomy as a central symbol for all the rankings of masculinity, for the division on any grounds between males who are 'real men' and have power, and males who are not\\". Michael KimmelKimmel, Michael S., and Summer Lewis. Mars and Venus, Or, Planet Earth?: Women and Men in a New . Kansas State University, 2004. furthers this notion; he says the trope 'you're so gay' indicates that one is devoid of masculinity, rather than being sexually attracted to members of the same sex. Pleck says that to avoid the continuation of male oppression of women and themselves and other men, patriarchal structures, institutions, and discourse must be eliminated from North American society. Gay men are considered by some to \\"deviate from the masculine norm\\", and are benevolently stereotyped as \\"gentle and refined\\" (even among other gay men), and pertain a specific mode of masculinity for themselves, according to human rights activists such as Peter Tatchell, which each make their contributions to society. In a documentary called The Butch Factor, a number of gay men‚Äîone of them transgender‚Äîwere asked about their views on masculinity. The consensus was that showing masculine traits was an advantage, both in and out the closet. For the \\"butch\\" gay men, this allowed them to conceal their sexual orientation for longer when doing masculine activities such as playing sports, as effeminacy is often incorrectly associated with homosexuality‚Äî so much so that they doubted their own sexual orientation; because they did not see themselves as effeminate, they did not feel they were gay. Because of this, they did not feel as much of a connection with gay culture. Men who had a more feminine appearance were the first to come out of the closet; they were the first to be labelled gay by their peers. They were more likely to face bullying and harassment throughout their lives; many gay men have been taunted using derogatory words that imply feminine qualities, for example, sissy. Effeminate or camp-acting gay men sometimes use what John R. Ballew describes as \\"camp humour\\", such as referring to one another using female pronouns as \\"a funny way of defusing hate directed toward [gay men]\\". Ballew has also said this \\"can cause [gay men] to become confused in relation to how we feel about being men\\". Some feminine gay men in the documentary felt uncomfortable about their femininity, even if they were comfortable with their sexuality. Feminine gay men are often looked down upon by stereotypically masculine men in the gay community. A study conducted by researchers from the Center for Theoretical Study at Charles University in Prague and The Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic found there are significant differences in the shape of faces of heterosexual and gay men; gay men have masculine features, which they say \\"undermined stereotypical notions of gay men as more feminine looking\\". Following a period of non-recognition from the media, gay men have been presented in the media in a stereotypical feminine way, which is open to ridicule (as well as lesbians and transvestites). Films such as Brokeback Mountain challenge this stereotype, though there is disagreement over the definition of the lead characters' sexuality. A newer portrayal of gay men in the LGBT community is as bears‚Äîa sub-culture of gay men who celebrate rugged masculinityGeorge Mazzei, (1979). \\"Who's Who in the Zoo?\\". The Advocate, pages 42‚Äì43. and \\"secondary sexual characteristics of the male: facial hair, body hair, proportional size, baldness\\". Smyth (2004) identified four classic stereotypes of gay men as effeminate, mentally ill, predatory or libido-driven maniacs; these stereotypes arrived in popular discourse during different time periods. This is significant, as if an individual does not interact with LGBT people on a regular basis, they may rely on the mass media for information on LGBT people and LGBT issues and thus retain these stereotypes. = Feminine gender roles = Multiple studies have correlated childhood gender nonconformity with eventual homosexual or bisexual outcomes in males, and gay and bisexual boys who adopted more feminine gender roles at a younger age are at higher risk of reporting suicide.Remafedi, Gary, James A. Farrow, and Robert W. Deisher. \\"Risk factors for attempted suicide in gay and bisexual youth.\\" Pediatrics 87.6 (1991) Many cultures, such as the kathoey in Thailand, have their own categorisations of sexual orientation and identity, and gender identity that are difficult to categorise using the Western labels gay and transgender. In the United States, boys are often homosocial, and gender role performance determines social rank.David and Brannon, 1976 While homosexual boys receive the same enculturation, they are far less compliant. Martin Levine says: > Harry (1982, 51‚Äì52), for example, found that 42 percent of his gay > respondents were 'sissies' during childhood. Only 11 percent of his > heterosexual samples were gender role nonconformists. Bell, Weinberg, and > Hammersmith (1981, 188) reported that half of their man homosexual subjects > practiced gender-inappropriate behaviour in childhood. Among their > heterosexual men, the rate of noncompliance was 25 percent. Saghir and > Robins (1973, 18) found that one-third of their gay man respondents > conformed to gender role dictates. Only 3 percent of their heterosexual men > deviated from the norm. Thus, effeminate boys, or sissies, are physically and verbally harassed, causing them to feel worthless and to \\"de-feminise\\" themselves.Saghir and Robins 1973, 18‚Äì19Levine, 1998, pp. 5‚Äì16 Prior to the Stonewall riots, changes in stereotypical gender role performance were observed among certain segments of the gay male population:Karlen, 1978Cory and LeRoy, 1963Newton, 1972 According to Stearn: > They have a different face for different occasions. In conversations with > each other, they often undergo a subtle change. I have seen men who appeared > to be normal suddenly smile roguishly, soften their voices, and simper as > they greeted homosexual friends ... Many times I saw these changes occur > after I had gained a homosexual's confidence and he could safely risk my > disapproval. Once as I watched a luncheon companion become an effeminate > caricature of himself, he apologised, [saying] \\"It is hard to always > remember that one is a man.\\"Stearn 1962, 29Levine, 1998, pp. 21‚Äì23 Pre-Stonewall \\"closet\\" culture accepted homosexuality as effeminate behaviour, and thus emphasised camp, drag, and swish behaviour, including an interest in fashion and decorating. Masculine gay men were marginalised and formed their own communities, such as the leather subculture and bear subculture, and wore clothes such as sailor uniforms that were commonly associated with working- class people.Levine, 1998, pp. 21‚Äì23, 56 Post-Stonewall, \\"clone culture\\" became dominant and effeminacy is now marginalised. This is evident in a definite preference shown in personal ads for masculine-behaving men.Bailey et al. 1997. Sheila Jeffreys termed this the butch shift of the 1970s, described it as having been inspired by the success of the gay liberation movement, and saw it as being exemplified in the Village People dance music group. The avoidance of effeminacy by men, including gay ones, has been linked to possible impedance of personal and public health. Regarding HIV/AIDS, masculine behaviour was stereotyped as being unconcerned about safe sex practices while engaging in promiscuous sexual behaviour. Early reports from New York City indicated more women had been tested for HIV/AIDS at their own behest than men.Levine, 1998, p. 148 David Halperin compares \\"universalising\\" and \\"minoritising\\" notions of gender deviance. He says, \\"'Softness' either may represent the specter of potential gender failure that haunts all normative masculinity, an ever-present threat to the masculinity of every man, or it may represent the disfiguring peculiarity of a small class of deviant individuals.\\"David Halperin, 2002 The term \\"effeminaphobia\\" was coined to describe strong anti-effeminacy. In 1995, J. Michael Bailey coined the similar term, \\"femiphobia\\", to describe the ambivalence gay men and culture have about effeminate behaviour.Michael Bailey, 1995 Gay author Tim Bergling also coined the term \\"sissyphobia\\" in his work Sissyphobia: Gay Men and Effeminate Behavior.Dylan Vox, \\"Would Life Be Better if You Were Straight?\\", Gaywired.com, 20 December 2007, also appeared in Edge, BostonBergling, Tim. Sissyphobia: Gay Men and Effeminate Behavior. = Top, bottom and versatile = In gay slang, to top means to have anal sex in an insertive capacity (penetrating with one's penis); to bottom means to have anal sex in a receptive capacity (being penetrated). When the terms are used as designations of self-identity, a top may be a man who has a clear preference for topping, and a bottom may be a man who has a clear preference for bottoming; versatile refers to a man who enjoys both and has no clear preference. Studies suggest that most gay men are in this sense versatiles.Saghir, M. T.; Robins, E. (1973). Male and female homosexuality: A comprehensive investigation. Oxford, England: Williams & Wilkins.Harry, J.; DeVall, W.B. (1978). The social organization of gay males. New York: Praeger. One study has found that a top is also more likely to act as an insertive partner in other forms of penetrative sex, such as penetrative fellatio and sex toy play. Because in heterosexual penetrative sex a man normally performs an insertive function and a woman normally performs a receptive function, popular opinion associates topping with masculinity and bottoming with femininity. Gender roles often color power dynamics in a hierarchical manner. Although this is not a requirement, some expect a top to be dominant in a relationship or at least during sex, while a bottom may be expected to be submissive. The expression power bottom refers to a bottom who tends to be dominant during sex.  Parenting, marriage and the family  A lesbian nuclear family There is considerable debate as to whether childhood gender stereotypes are inborn or are influenced by environmental factors. The presence of homosexual or heterosexual relationships in families influences play patterns in children: children of same-sex couples are raised differently, resulting in gender roles different from those of opposite-sex parents, according to the gender binary. A study by Goldberg, Kashy and Smith shows that sons of lesbian mothers play in a less-masculine way than sons of homosexual fathers or of heterosexual parents. Non-traditional families, that is families where e.g. the mothers work, are now in a majority in the United States; with the advent of artificial insemination, surrogate mothering, and adoption, families do not have to be formed by the biological union of a male and a female. The consequences of these changes for the adults and children involved are much debated. In a 2009 Massachusetts spousal benefits case, developmental psychologist Michael Lamb testified that parental sexual orientation does not negatively affect childhood development.\\"Since the end of the 1980s ... it has been well established that children and adolescents can adjust just as well in nontraditional settings as in traditional settings\\" Michael Lamb, Ph.D.: Affidavit ‚Äì United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (2009) Columnist Maggie Gallagher says heteronormative social structures are beneficial to society because they are optimal for the raising of children. Psychologists, Costa and Davies (2012), found that enforcing conservative gender roles, a social structure, is correlated with holding negative feelings and ideas for the LGBT community. Australian-Canadian ethicist Margaret Somerville says, \\"giving same-sex couples the right to found a family unlinks parenthood from biology\\".Margaret Somerville ‚Äì In Conversation There has also been much research into childhood gender nonconformity and sexual orientation. Gay men often report having been feminine boys and lesbian women often report having been masculine girls. In men, CGN is a strong predictor of sexual orientation in adulthood, but this relationship is not as well understood in women. Women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia reported more male-typical play behaviours and showed less heterosexual interest. Division of labour Maura Kelly and Elizabeth Hauck conducted research on the division of labour within same-sex relationships through interviewing a sample of same- sex couples (2015). Kelly and Hauck's study found that labour in same-sex couples is divided on the basis of time availability and personal preference.These factors are more influential in the division of labour than the belief that the labour should be divided evenly between the partners in same-sex couples. Kelly and Hauck's research found that divisions of labour within a same-sex relationship cannot be viewed as setting a precedent as to what gender roles are normal. A female partner in a same-sex relationship may perform chores that are considered feminine, like cooking, cleaning, and child-rearing. However, the other female partner may perform chores that are considered masculine, like outside work and employment outside of the home. The partners‚Äô behaviours do not support gender roles because all the roles performed are done by women. There is not an inherent distinction made between masculine and feminine because women are performing both types of chores. This lack of gender role discrimination would be true in same-sex relationships between two men as well.  Feminism  One large myth about lesbians is that they are all feminists. While this is not true, there is a specific branch of feminism called \\"lesbian feminism\\", a cultural movement in the Western world, most influential in the 1970s‚Äì1980s, that advocates lesbianism as the logical result of feminism.Rich, A. (1980). Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence. Signs, 5, 631‚Äì660. Vanessa Thorpe says in The Observer, \\"... key members of the Votes For Women movement led a promiscuous lesbian lifestyle\\". The women's suffrage movement is generally considered a feminist movement. Lesbian feminism typically situates the state of being a lesbian as a form of resistance to patriarchal institutions. Sexual orientation is posited here as a choice, or at least a conscious response to a situation.\\"Lesbians in Revolt: Male Supremacy Quakes and Quivers\\", The Furies: Lesbian/Feminist Monthly Vol. 1, January 1972. Accessed 2 June 2008. It is also seen as a critique of male supremacy, chauvinism, and masculinity in general.Jeffreys, Sheila: \\"Unpacking Queer Politics,\\" p. 19. Polity, 2003. Lesbian separatism is a form of separatist feminism specific to lesbians. In separatist feminism, lesbianism is posited as a key feminist strategy that enables women to invest their energies in other women, creating new space and dialogue about women's relationships, and typically limits their dealings with men.Revolutionary Lesbians: \\"How to Stop Choking to Death Or: Separatism,\\" 1971, in, \\"For Lesbians Only: A Separatist Anthology,\\" ed. Hoagland, Sarah Lucia, and Julia Penelope. pp. 22‚Äì24. Onlywomen Press, 1988. Second-wave pro-feminism paid increased attention to issues of sexuality, particularly the relationship between homosexual men and hegemonic masculinity. This shift led to more cooperation between the men's liberation and gay liberation movements. In part, this cooperation arose because masculinity was understood to be a social construction, and as a response to the universalization of \\"men\\" seen in previous men's movements. In 2010, Elizabeth Wilson wrote that the Gay Liberation Front and feminism worked alongside one another to \\"spark a way of thinking about human relations in society that has led to significant change\\"; Peter Tatchell wrote about the GLF's \\"idealistic vision [that] involved creating a new sexual democracy, without homophobia, misogyny, racism and class privilege\\".

In recent years there has been controversy about the cost of the pumps which keep the valley drained. For some years the pumping has been funded by the Environment Agency, but the Agency decided that there were more significant rpobelms in the area. The creation of an Internal drainage board has been discussed as an alternative. The Agency committed itself to keeping the pumping stations in operation until 2020 to allow more time for a decision on how water level management would to be organised in future. Ecological implications There have been objections from environmentalists to a drainage regime which does not take account of the valley's contribution to biodiversity. It is argued that a less intensive drainage scheme would benefit wildlife, and still allow farming or paludiculture.

It is located near the R136 cluster in the 30 Doradus nebula. At and it is the third most massive and the fifth most luminous star known. Observations A 1978 survey carried out by J. Melnick covered the 30 Doradus region and found six new W-R stars, all belonging to the WN sequence. The survey observed stars that were above magnitude 14 and that were within two arcminutes of the centre of the 30 Doradus nebula, and BAT99-98 was labelled as star J. It was found to have an apparent magnitude of 13.5 and a spectral type of WN-5. The following year, 13 new Wolf Rayet stars in the LMC were reported, one of which was Mel J. It was numbered 12, referred to as AB 12, or LMC AB 12 to distinguish it from the better-known SMC AB stars. Melnick conducted another study of stars in NGC 2070 and gave BAT99-98 the number 49, referred to as Melnick 49, this time giving the spectral type WN7. Neither the AB12 nor Mel J designations are in common use, although Melnick 49 is sometimes seen. More commonly, LMC Wolf Rayet stars are referred to by R (Radcliffe Observatory) numbers, Brey (Breysacher catalogue) numbers, or BAT99 numbers. Characteristics The star is located near the R136 cluster and shares similar mass-luminosity properties to the massive stars in R136. It is estimated that at its birth that the star held and has since lost . It sheds a large amount of mass through a stellar wind that moves at . The star has a surface temperature of and a luminosity of . Although the star is very luminous due to its high temperature, it is only 141,000 times brighter than the sun visually. It is classified as a WN6 star. Fate The future of BAT99-98 depends on its mass loss. It is thought that stars this massive will never lose enough mass to avoid a catastrophic end. The result is likely to be a supernova, hypernova, gamma-ray burst, or perhaps almost no visible explosion, and leaving behind a black hole or neutron star. The exact details depend heavily on the timing and amount of the mass loss, with current models not fully reproducing observed stars, but the most massive stars in the local universe are expected to produce type Ib or Ic supernovae, sometimes with a gamma-ray burst, and leave behind a black hole.

Listed at 5' 8\\" , 156 lb. , he batted and threw right- handed. Houston is remembered as the first player in Organized Baseball to die during active duty in World War II. Born in Clarksville, Arkansas, Gordon Houston moved along with his family to Shreveport, Louisiana in the early 1920s, and were in Dallas, Texas in the early 1930s. They eventually settled in San Antonio, Texas, in 1937. Gordon and his brother Charles Jr., commonly called C. L. like their father, showed interest in sports at an early age. Both were stars on the baseball and football teams at Sunset High School in Dallas, and following their graduation in 1934, they enrolled at College of the Ozarks in Clarksville. The brothers attended class during the winter months and played semi-professional baseball with a lumber yard team in the summer. By 1936, the Houston attended Henderson State Teachers College in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, where they starred on the football team. After moving to San Antonio, Gordon and C. L. enrolled at local St. Mary's University, and pretty soon they received an invitation to attend a tryout with the Monroe Twins of the Class-C Cotton States League.. Both brothers were offered contracts to play with Monroe in the 1937 season. Gordon batted .315 and slugged .417 in 46 games while playing at shortstop; C. L. played at center field and batted .315 in 21 games. During the off-season, they had heard that the Texarkana Liners of the Class-C East Texas League had appointed Sam Gray as their new manager. Gray, a former Philadelphia Athletics and St. Louis Browns pitcher, would be looking for new players when the team started spring training in 1938. Finally, Gordon was added to the roster, but C. L. did not make the final cut. Gordon Houston had his most productive season with the Liners in 1938, when he led the East Texas League with a .384 average and his .618 slugging percentage was second best in the eight-team circuit. Houston started at left field and later moved to right field, going 3-for-4 on Opening Day and staying above .400 until the midseason, but never hit below .380 throughout the rest of the season. In addition, he collected 32 doubles, seven triples and 18 home runs, driving in 70 runs while stealing 25 bases in 108 games. Besides, Houston appeared in the midseason East Texas League All-Star Game in which played eleven future major leaguers. Houston went 5-for-5, scored one run and drove in another for the North team. After the game, he was sent to the Class-A Oklahoma City Indians of the Texas League and went 6-for-22 in seven games, helping the Indians swept the Houston Buffaloes in a crucial doubleheader, before returning to Texarkana. At the end of the season, he was selected to the East Texas League Season-End All-Star team. Houston returned with Texarkana in 1939 and looking forward to achieve another strong season. Unfortunately, he suffered a spike wound to his foot early in the season that kept him out of the lineup for two weeks, which was more detrimental to his performance than he had thought possible. He appeared in just 109 games, batting a paltry .219 average with three homers and 39 RBI. Houston rebounded in 1940 while playing his third consecutive season with Texarkana, appearing in a career-high 129 games and leading the team in average (.304), hits (158) and doubles (30). It was a solid season for the 24-year-old outfielder but there were no offers available in a year that saw a major escalation in World War II. In November 1940, The Houston brothers decided to enlist in the peacetime United States Army Air Corp since they both wanted to be pilots. Gordon passed the eye exam, which required 20/20 vision at that time, but C. L. did not. In February 1941, C. L. prepared for basic training in a ground-based role with the Air Corps, while Gordon reported to the Ontario Air National Guard Station in California for primary flight training. After the Attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Second lieutenant Houston assumed his position as flight leader with the 55th Pursuit Group stationed at McChord Field in Tacoma, Washington, the headquarters of the GHQ Air Force Northwest Air District. Piloting his Republic P-43 Lancer, a pre-war fighter plane unfit for combat, Houston would lead his flight up and down the coast on the lookout for Japanese submarines or aircraft carriers that might be tempted by the concentration of large airplane manufacturing plants in that region. On February 10, 1942, Houston's flight was landing at McChord Field in Tacoma after an uneventful sortie. As he approached the runway, another plane was coming in directly beneath him. Then, Houston climbed slightly so he could head for the end of the runway and the overrun, a grassy area at the end of the runway that was used in case a plane overshoots a little. What Houston did not realize was that a hitch had been dug during the day to lay some sewer tile. As a result, his plane, which had poor forward visibility when taxiing, hit the ditch and flipped over. Houston died instantly. Funeral services were held at the Fort Sam Houston Post Chapel in San Antonio, Texas on February 14, 1942, and Gordon Houston was buried in the National Cemetery at Fort Sam Houston with full military honors.

When he was 12 the war ended, and his part of what remained of Germany became the Soviet occupation zone, which would be transformed over the next few years into the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), sponsored by and politically modelled on the Soviet Union. After passing his school final exams, he studied at the \\"Karl Marx University\\" (as became known in 1953) at Leipzig. He emerged in 1955 with a degree in Journalism. He had already joined the national Union of Journalists in 1952, but it was not till 1963, his thirtieth year, that he became a member of the country's ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands). From 1955 till 1956 he worked as an editor for the local radio station in Schwerin. He then, from 1956 till 1964, worked as an editor and travel correspondent for the country's national broadcasting committee, a committee modeled on its Soviet equivalent that controlled radio, and increasingly television broadcasting. From 1965 till 1971 Makosch worked as a chief foreign correspondent for the East German Television Corporation, focused on south-east Asia and based, for much of the time, in Djakarta and Singapore. He also wrote reports about the region, notably about the 1965 putsch in Indonesia and, later, about the Vietnam war, and published numerous books on these and related topics. From 1972 till 1975 he was deputy chief editor for reportage and documentary with the television company, after which, for fifteen years till 1990, he was deputy chief editor of the long-running news programme (viewed in some quarters as a \\"propaganda tool\\") Aktuelle Kamera. For many years he also fronted Objektiv, a weekly political television programme focused on foreign policy concerns and issues. In 1990/1991 he worked for CNN. From 1978 till 1989 he served as a member of the Berlin district party leadership. He served on the GDR-Mozambique Friendship Committee between 1978 and 1990. He became also a volunteer member of the Society for the Protection of Civil Rights and Human Values, an organisation established following German reunification by members of the former East German establishment, including lawyers, scientists and State Security officers/collaborators in response to concerns that they might face gratuitous hostility or injustice because of things alleged to have happened under the old East German regime. After 1990 it transpired that he had served the Ministry for State Security since the 1950s as a secret informer, recorded in the Stasi files from 1969 under the code name \\"IMB Primus\\".IMB / Inoffizieller Mitarbeiter mit Feindber√ºhrung can be translated as \\"Informal Collaborator with Enemy Contacts\\" References Category:1933 births Category:2008 deaths Category:People from Wittenberge Category:People from the Province of Brandenburg Category:Socialist Unity Party of Germany politicians Category:East German journalists Category:German television journalists Category:German radio journalists Category:Recipients of the Patriotic Order of Merit in bronze Category:People of the Stasi ","title":"Ulrich Makosch"},{"id":"46207248","text":"Antipathes dichotoma is a species of colonial coral in the order Antipatharia, the black corals, so named because their calcareous skeletons are black. It was first described by the German zoologist and botanist Peter Simon Pallas in 1766, from a single specimen he received from near Marseilles in the Mediterranean Sea. Description A colony of Antipathes dichotoma can grow to a height of or more. It forms a sparsely branching structure with slender, flexible branches arranged irregularly around the trunk. The angle at which the branches project is variable but is often nearly 90¬∞. The smaller branches bear four to six rows of short, smooth conical spines. The polyps are in diameter with three or four polyps per centimetre. They are arranged in a single series on the smallest branches and in multiple series on the largest ones. There is considerable variation in appearance of neighbouring colonies and in different parts of the same colony. Distribution Antipathes dichotoma occurs in the Mediterranean Sea and parts of the temperate western Atlantic Ocean. Its range includes waters off the coast of Marseilles, the Gulf of Naples, the Tyrrhenian Sea, the Bay of Biscay and off the coast of Morocco. It is a deep water species and is found at depths of . Where this species has been recorded as occurring in the Indo-Pacific region, it may have been misidentified. The black coral growing off Hawaii, for example, has been reclassified as Antipathes griggi.

NKJV *\\"Savior\\" (Greek: , '): The second of three times in this letter (others: 1:1; 4:10) that God is called \\"Savior\\", recalling the 'well-known appellation of Yahweh in the Greek Old Testament' (for examples, LXX ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ). Men and Women at Prayer (2:8‚Äì15; 3:1) Verse 12 :And I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man, but to be in silence. NKJV * \\"I do not permit a woman to teach\\" (KJV: \\"But I suffer not a woman to teach\\"): John Gill interprets this in the sense of women may teach only in private, that is, in their own houses and families, to bring up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, not to forsake the law or doctrine of a mother, any more than the instruction of a father (see ; ), and they are to be teachers of good things (cf. ). Timothy surely received a lot of advantage from the private teachings and instructions of his mother Eunice, and grandmother Lois, but then women were not to teach in the church. * \\"To have authority over a man\\" (KJV: \\"to usurp authority over the man\\"): Gill sees this as not to be done in civil and political things, or in things relating to civil government; and in things domestic, or the affairs of the family, therefore also not in ecclesiastical things, nor what relate to the church, for one part of rule is to feed the church with knowledge and understanding; and for a woman to do this, can be seen as to usurp an authority over the man. * \\"To be in silence\\": according to Gill is \\"to sit and hear quietly\\", learning, not teaching, as in .

Curling career   Juniors  As a junior curler, Mosaner represented Italy in four World Junior Curling Championships. He played third for Italy at the 2012 World Junior Curling Championships, on a team skipped by Andrea Pilzer. The team finished 9th. Mosaner then became skip of the Italian junior team for the next three World Juniors. At the 2013 World Junior Curling Championships, Mosaner led his team of Pilzer, Daniele Ferrazza and Roberto Arman to a 6th-place finish (5-4 record). At the 2014 World Junior Curling Championships, he led his team of Sebastiano Arman, Ferrazza and Roberto Arman to a 5th-place finish, losing in a tie-breaker to Switzerland. Finally, at the 2015 World Junior Curling Championships, he was less successful, leading his team of Sebastiano Arman, Carlo Gottardi and Fabio Ribotta to an 8th-place finish (3-6). While Mosaner played in four World Juniors, the highlight of his junior career came at the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics, where he skipped Italy to a silver medal finish. After a 4-3 round robin record, he led his team of Denise Pimpini, Alessandro Zoppi and Adriana Losano to playoff wins against the United States and Canada, before losing to Switzerland in the final.  Men's  During his junior career, Mosaner also skipped the Italian men's team. He led his teammates of Pilzer, Ferrazza and Roberto Arman to a 12th-place finish at the 2013 European Curling Championships. His team had much more success at the 2014 European Curling Championships. After finishing the round robin in 2nd place with a 7-2 record, they then lost all of their playoff games, including the bronze medal match, settling for 4th. This placement qualified Italy to play in the 2015 Ford World Men's Curling Championship. The team would add veteran Joel Retornaz to skip the team for the Worlds, with Mosaner throwing last rocks. There, the team finished 10th. The next season, the team finished 8th at the 2015 European Curling Championships, failing to qualify the country for the Worlds. For the 2016-17 season, Mosaner moved to the third position on the team. They finished 7th at the 2016 European Curling Championships, and qualified for the 2017 World Men's Curling Championship. There, Mosaner resumed his position throwing fourth rocks on the team, which finished 9th overall. The team finished 8th at the 2017 European Curling Championships, but had much more success a month later at the 2018 Winter Olympic Qualification Event. The team won the event, qualifying Italy for the 2018 Winter Olympics, where they finished 9th. They finished the season finishing 8th at the 2018 World Men's Curling Championship. Mosaner played third for Italy at the 2018 European Curling Championships, where the country won its first medal at the event since 1979, picking up a bronze. He played third for Italy again at the 2019 World Men's Curling Championship, finishing in 7th place. Later that month, after winning the 2019 Italian Mixed Doubles Curling Championship he competed in the 2019 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship for the first time, with partner Alice Cobelli. The pair finished the round robin with a 5-2 record, in third place in their group. The pair missed out on the playoffs as their draw shot challenge (DSC) record was not good enough compared to the other third place teams. In January 2020 Mosaner together with Alice Cobelli won 2020 Italian Mixed Doubles Curling Championship and they will represent Italy on 2020 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship. Personal life In 2015, Mosaner was employed as a farmer.

A passenger, Pete Hamilton, spots her as a phony after discovering her valuable bracelet is actually made of paste. While his pal Wally Case deals with an irate Bubbles Hennessy, a singer who is suing him for breach of promise, Pete befriends Marjory and volunteers to help her find a suitable guy. He singles out Alfred Monroe, who is not very exciting but definitely well-off. Marjory goes to work on Alfred, but nothing she tries, from flattery to alcohol, makes him fall for her. A voodoo priestess gives Wally a love potion. Skeptical at first, he and Pete try it on Alfred and it works. Alfred is now madly in love with Marjory and she accepts his proposal, causing Pete to feel a pang of jealousy. Before she can leave, Marjory's true identity's become known and the hotel demands that she pay her bill. Pete and Wally scheme to steal Bubbles's expensive brooch and raffle it off. Bubbles uses the potion on Wally and gets him to the altar. Marjory, meanwhile, sails off for New York with her new beau, Alfred, who generously offers $2,000 to Pete for introducing him to his bride-to-be.

These features can be used to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. Feature engineering can be considered as applied machine learning itself .  Features  A feature is an attribute or property shared by all of the independent units on which analysis or prediction is to be done. Any attribute could be a feature, as long as it is useful to the model. The purpose of a feature, other than being an attribute, would be much easier to understand in the context of a problem. A feature is a characteristic that might help when solving the problem.  Importance  Features are important to predictive models and influence results . It is asserted that feature engineering plays an important part of Kaggle competitions and machine learning project's success or failure .  Process  The feature engineering process is: *Brainstorming or testing features; * Deciding what features to create; * Creating features; * Checking how the features work with your model; * Improving your features if needed; * Go back to brainstorming/creating more features until the work is done.  Relevance  A feature could be strongly relevant (i.e., the feature has information that doesn't exist in any other feature), relevant, weakly relevant (some information that other features include) or irrelevant. Even if some features are irrelevant, having too many is better than missing those that are important. Feature selection can be used to prevent overfitting.  Feature explosion  Feature explosion can be caused by feature combination or feature templates, both leading to a quick growth in the total number of features. * Feature templates - implementing feature templates instead of coding new features * Feature combinations - combinations that cannot be represented by the linear system Feature explosion can be limited via techniques such as: regularization, kernel method, feature selection.  Automation  Automation of feature engineering is a research topic that dates back to at least the late 1990s. The academic literature on the topic can be roughly separated into two strings: First, Multi-relational decision tree learning (MRDTL), which uses a supervised algorithm that is similar to a decision tree. Second, more recent approaches, like Deep Feature Synthesis, which use simpler methods. Multi-relational decision tree learning (MRDTL) generates features in the form of SQL queries by successively adding new clauses to the queries. For instance, the algorithm might start out with SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ATOM t1 LEFT JOIN MOLECULE t2 ON t1.mol_id = t2.mol_id GROUP BY t1.mol_id The query can then successively be refined by adding conditions, such as \\"WHERE t1.charge <= -0.392\\". However, most of the academic studies on MRDTL use implementations based on existing relational databases, which results in many redundant operations. These redundancies can be reduced by using tricks such as tuple id propagation. More recently, it has been demonstrated that the efficiency can be increased further by using incremental updates, which completely eliminates redundancies. In 2015, researchers at MIT presented the Deep Feature Synthesis algorithm and demonstrated its effectiveness in online data science competitions where it beat 615 of 906 human teams. Deep Feature Synthesis is available as an open source library called Featuretools. That work was followed by other researchers including IBM's OneBM and Berkeley's ExploreKit. The researchers at IBM stated that feature engineering automation \\"helps data scientists reduce data exploration time allowing them to try and error many ideas in short time. On the other hand, it enables non-experts, who are not familiar with data science, to quickly extract value from their data with a little effort, time, and cost.\\" See also * Covariate * Data transformation * Feature learning * Hashing trick * Kernel method * List of datasets for machine learning research * Space mapping References Further reading  Category:Machine learning Category:Data analysis ","title":"Feature engineering"},{"id":"46207366","text":"An Argentine pastafrola in a baking tray Pasta frola (),Œ†Œ¨œÉœÑŒ± œÜŒªœéœÅŒ± .

Planning for effective business Information systems, 1988  In his 1988 Planning for effective business Information systems, Tozer developed a particular view on Enterprise Data Planning, that dealt with the complexities of extracting key business needs from senior management and then defining relevant architectural visions for the specific enterprise. In the early 1980s James Martin had been one of the pathfinders in data planning methodologies. He was one of the first to identify data as being an enterprise wide asset that required management, and had developed a series of tools and methods to support that process.James Martin. Viewdata and the information society. 1982 Most of the large consulting firms developed their own methods to address the same basic issue. Frequently, their approaches were incorporated into their own branded system development methodologies that encompassed the complete systems development life-cycle.

It is also known as The Little Deer. Through The Wounded Deer, Kahlo shares her enduring physical and emotional suffering with her audience, as she did throughout her creative oeuvre. This painting in particular was created towards the end of Kahlo's life, when her health was in decline. Kahlo combines pre-Columbian, Buddhist, and Christian symbols to express her wide spectrum of influences and beliefs. Kahlo was injured at the age of 18 in a bus accident that resulted in serious injuries to her entire body. Her spine, ribs, pelvis, right leg, and abdomen were particularly damaged.Drucker, Malka.Frida Kahlo: Torment and Triumph in her Life and Art. New York: Bantam Books, 1991. Pages 23-26. She would deal with the wounds from this accident for the rest of her life. Kahlo painted this self-portrait after an operation on her spine, which would leave her bedridden for almost a year. During her recovery, she wore a steel corset, which can be seen in her late self-portraits.Herrera, Hayden. Frida Kahlo: the Paintings. New York: Harper Perennial, 1993. Page 191. Her right leg would eventually be amputated up to her knee, as a result of gangrene. The variety of cultural influences reflect Kahlo's own background. She had a German father and a Mexican mother, thus she was aware of traditional European and Mexican ideas during her childhood.Drucker, Malka. Frida Kahlo: Torment and Triumph in her Life and Art. New York: Bantam Books, 1991. Pages 1-10. It is also known that Kahlo was interested in Eastern Religion during the later years of her life.Kahlo, Frida. Frida Kahlo. London: Tate Publishing, 2005. Pages 42-43. In 1940, Kahlo married fellow Mexican artist Diego Rivera for the second time. Their second marriage saw many of the same problems as their first, filled with jealousy, affairs, and arguments.Drucker, Malka. Frida Kahlo: Torment and Triumph in her Life and Art. New York: Bantam Books, 1991. Page 105. Around the time she created The Wounded Deer, Kahlo made a drawing of a young deer in her diary, which is thought to be inspired by her pet deer, Granizo.Kahlo, Frida. The Diary of Frida Kahlo: an Intimate Self-Portrait. New York: N.H. Abrams, 1995. Page 265. The Wounded Deer was given by Kahlo to close friends Arcady and Lina Boytler as a wedding gift.Herrera, Hayden. Frida Kahlo: the Paintings. New York: Harper Perennial. Page 188. Description In The Wounded Deer, Kahlo paints herself as an animal and human hybrid. She has the body of a deer along with antlers extending from her own head. The deer is standing up, its legs extended in action. Its front right leg is elevated off the ground, as though it is injured or in motion. In the deer's body are nine arrows, creating wounds from which blood flows. The deer is in a forest; nine trees are on the right of the deer, and a broken branch lies in the foreground. Only the tree trunks can be seen in the picture plane; none of the foliage above is visible. One of the branches on the tree in the right of the foreground is severed. It is probable that the detached limb is the branch located on the ground before the deer. The broken branch is prominent, as it is given more detail by the artist than all of the forest floor. Kahlo's face stares stoically at the viewer, showing little sign of pain. Her neck and head are upright and alert. A set of deer ears emerge from behind Kahlo's own. In the background a body of water is present, which can be seen through the trees. Though the sky is bright, a bolt of lightning strikes down from a white cloud. The word \\"carma\\" (karma) is written in the bottom left corner of the painting, after the artist's signature and the year of creation. The Wounded Deer is mostly rendered with green, brown, and gray tones, as well as small measures of blue and red. The painting's physical dimensions are very modest, measuring at only 22.4 x 30 centimeters.Souter, Gerry. Frida Kahlo: Beneath the Mirror. Parkstone International, 2010. Page 122. Interpretation and analysis In this painting, Kahlo shares her lifelong splanchnic pain with her audience.Bauer, Claudia. Frida Kahlo. New York: Prestel, 2007. Page 107. The pain she represents is not only physical, but emotional torment caused by her relationship with Rivera. Compared to the grand murals of other Mexican contemporaries, such as Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Jos√© Clemente Orozco, Kahlo's paintings were small. Some critics interpret the scale of her works as a sign of isolation, which also downplays her painful circumstances.Booker, Bobbi. \\"Private Kahlo Works Unveiled\\". Philadelphia Tribune, February 17, 2008. It is Mexican tradition to place a broken branch on a grave. This is taken as an acknowledgement of the artist's deteriorating health.Judy Chicago and Frances Borzello. Frida Kahlo: Face to Face. Munich; New York: Prestel, 2012. Page 238. Despite the wounds on the body of the deer, Kahlo does not paint a face of anguish, but of strength. Scholars point out that the antlers on Kahlo's head are those of a stag, a male deer.Delgado, Marina. \\"The Female Grotesque in the Works of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Isabelle Allende, and Frida Kahlo\\". The University of Texas at Dallas, ProQuest, UMI Dissertations Publishing, 2010.Dosamantes-Beaudry, Irma. \\"Frida Kahlo: Self- Other Representation and Self-Healing Through Art\\". The Arts in Psychotherapy 28, no. 1, February 2001. Pages 5-17.Grimberg, Salomon. Frida Kahlo: Song of Herself. London; New York: Merrell, 2008. Pages 26-27. Kahlo is representing herself as part male and part female, as well as elements of human and animal features. This hybrid form is often explained by the artist's influence of pre-Columbian ideas and traditions, which hold the belief that the right foot is represented by a deer. In this belief system, days were represented by a symbol and a number which preferably would be caused by the great number of the tree branches. Important dates such as birthdays which were used in predictions could also be used. Kahlo adopted the deer as a symbol for herself because of its connection to the right foot, and in the Aztec calendar, she was born on day nine. These two symbols together were not good, as nine was a symbol for earthly elements as well as the underworld, which was made up of nine phases. The number nine can be seen twice in The Wounded Deer: there are nine trees in the left side, before the clearing that reveals the ocean and lightning bolt, as well as nine arrows protruding from the body of the deer. An additional nine can be seen in the points of her antlers, if counted together. In the painting, the deer's front right leg is raised off the ground, perhaps in a reflection of Kahlo's own impairment. At the time she painted The Wounded Deer, Kahlo had difficulty walking, which she would attempt to correct through a spinal surgery later that year. Some art historians believe that Kahlo's decision to portray herself with male and female features is a reflection of her own sexuality. This perception recognizes her bisexuality. Other interpretations of the figure relate the male and female elements, referred to as hermaphroditic, to pre-Columbian Aztec beliefs that hold relationships between animals and parts of the human body. The meaning of the word \\"carma\\", painted in the lower left corner of the painting, is controversial. It was Kahlo's own belief that her life was planned out by destiny or fate, and therefore she could not prevent any of the difficulties she faced. Consequently, her misfortune must have been caused by deeds from her previous lives. An influence of Christianity is also integrated through reference to the story of Saint Sebastian, a martyr who was tied to a tree and shot by arrows.\\"Saint Sebastian  Biography Christian Martyr\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Accessed April 15, 2015. The pre-Columbian, Buddhist, and Christian symbols combine to reflect Kahlo's multi-cultural reality a reality which also represents a spectrum of gender possibilities. She renders herself with these juxtaposing features to explore the concept of the self. Through these changes, identity is seen as dynamic and complex, not a fixed state.Kahlo, Frida. Frida Kahlo.

The wharf is the major public transport link of the Barangaroo precinct, situated west of the Sydney central business district. The complex consists two wharves, with provision for a third wharf in the future. It is serviced by Sydney Ferries' F3 Paramatta River and F4 Cross Harbour services. The wharf opened on 26 June 2017. Barangaroo was built on the premise of being a second major terminal for the Sydney Ferries network, after Circular Quay. The third ferry wharf in the history of the Sydney Ferries network to be situated in Darling Harbour, it serves as a replacement for King Street Wharf 3, designed as a long-term solution to a conclusion made by the Walker Report, which called for easing of congestion through a second terminal at Darling Harbour. Originally scheduled to be opened in 2016, construction of the wharf was delayed by a year, and was controversial for many alleged occupational health and safety violations, which resulted in the death of a worker in February 2017. History Background Ferry services to the Darling Harbour precinct were originally serviced by the Darling Harbour Aquarium wharf. This was the only wharf to service Darling Harbour until Pyrmont Bay was opened in the early 2000s. In 2007, the Walker Report recommended a new ferry terminal at Darling Harbour be built to ease congestion on the network, especially at Circular Quay. The wharf was to be situated at the Darling Harbour wharf, and services to the Aquarium wharf, 250 metres to the east, phased out. Thus Darling Harbour wharf, which was a stop on the Parramatta River service, was chosen as a site for a new terminal. The Aquarium wharf continued to operate as part of Darling Harbour ferry services until 10 October 2010, when as part of a new timetable change all Sydney Ferries services were diverted to Darling Harbour. The Barangaroo area, which had been a derelict port for years, had been a long-proposed site for urban renewal. Following proposals put forward by the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority and reviews by the O'Farrell State Government, major construction and redevelopment at Barangaroo began in 2011. In May 2013, the State Government outlined plans to build a new terminal at Barangaroo to replace Darling Harbour. As well as allowing for additional services on the F3 Paramatta River route, the increased capacity will allow other routes, such as a then-envisioned potential extension of the F7 Eastern Suburbs route, to also use the new wharves. It was proposed that all Sydney Ferries routes that used the Darling Harbour wharf will be rerouted to Barangaroo, with Darling Harbour to be decommissioned and handed back to private operation. Construction Pre-construction activities at the site of the wharf at Barangaroo South in April 2015. Construction was originally scheduled to commence in 2015, with the wharves to open in 2016.Barangaroo Ferry Hub Transport for NSW In April 2015, Transport for NSW issued Invitations to Tender to three companies to build the wharves.Tender out to deliver Barangaroo Ferry Hub Transport for NSW 24 April 2015 A contract was awarded to McConnell Dowell later in September. Over the time period of the wharf's construction, it has been alleged by the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union that over 1,500 incidents concerning worker safety have occurred on the wharf. In late February 2017, during the latter stages of the wharf's construction, a worker was killed after being accidentally struck with a metal large header beam while working on a construction barge. The man, a Maitland local in his 30s, was reportedly killed instantaneously, and was declared dead at the scene. An investigation into the incident was initiated by SafeWork NSW and the New South Wales Police Force shortly afterward. The accident also sparked attention from local and national media, whom emphasised the \\"tragic\\" narrative of the incident; the man being married and fathering a 14-month old son at the time of his death. Preliminary investigations found that a metal beam carried by a crane struck a pile of steel beams, causing one to fall off and land on the man's torso, instantly crushing and killing him. The crane's driver was subject to mandatory blood and urine testing afterwards. New South Wales Minister for Transport Andrew Constance publicly expressed his condolences over the accident, stating that he hoped that the government's agencies would \\"co-operate fully with all investigations into this very sad incident.\\" The Maritime Union of Australia claimed that the accident was \\"completely preventable\\", having been previously denied access to the site when they attempted to investigate reports unsafe work conditions, prior to the fatal accident. Opening The wharf was completed in late June 2017, estimated to have cost A$59 million to build overall. The first ferry to arrive at the wharf, on the morning 26 June 2017, was the MV Fred Hollows, which had entered service onto the Sydney Ferries network as the first Heritage-class ferry, the same day. The ceremonial first service was attended by Berejiklian and Constance, whom officially opened the wharf upon arrival. The wharf's opening followed the decommissioning of the nearby Darling Harbour / King Street Wharf 3, with the wharf returning to private hands upon its last Sydney Ferries services on the night of 25 June 2017, with Barangaroo serving as its replacement as intended. The wharf initially services the F3 Parramatta River and F4 Darling Harbour routes, both from wharf 1 of the complex, while wharf 2 remains closed. Changes to the F3 and F4 timetables also came into effect on 26 June 2017, to accommodate for the opening of Barangaroo and decommissioning of Darling Harbour. The timetables for the State Transit Authority bus routes 466 and 513, which service the Cabarita and Meadowbank ferry wharves, were also modified in accordance to the new changes. Design Resting area for commuters at wharf 1. The berths of the wharf are located at the left and right side of the image. Both wharves at Barangaroo are measured at 48 meters long and 23 meters wide, with both wharves being able to accommodate a maximum of eight ferries at any given time, with two on each of its four berths. Designed by Aurecon and Cox Architecture, whom had previously helped design the wharves of Brisbane's ferry network, the complex is similar to the design of wharves on Sydney Harbour redeveloped in the 2010s, with large, \\"curved silver roofs\\" as the artistic centerpiece of the structure. The complex also features \\"fully accessible pontoons, seated waiting areas, weather protection, [and] real-time service information\\", with open, ungated access accompanied by opal card reader nodes at the entrance to both wharves. Lead architect David Holm stated that the wharf's design was crafted with the \\"language that is consistent with the suite of Sydney harbour ferry wharves\\" in mind, describing the \\"twofold\\" process of resolving function and identity. He further commented that the wharf's function, the \\"delivery of streamlined passenger flows and a simplicity of functional layout\\" was contrasted with its identity, an \\"expression of Sydney harbour‚Äôs iconic maritime history and architectural form. The wharf's location on Barangaroo's Wulugul Walk enables direct access to the Sydney central business district; it also enables a transport interchange link to Wynyard railway station through the Wynyard Walk, an underground pedestrian tunnel purpose-built to allow direct access between the station and Barangaroo. Services MV Nicole Livingstone berthed at Barangaroo wharf 1, during a morning F3 Parramatta River service. Barangaroo Wharf consists of four platforms on two wharves. Wharf 1's Side A berth hosts ferries operating on the F3 Paramatta River service, while the Side B berth hosts ferries travelling on the F4 Cross Harbour service. Wharf 2 is currently unused as of the June 2017 timetable, and provisions will be made for a potential third wharf in the future. Initially, the wharves are expected to be used by up to 11 vessels per hour during weekday peak periods and 14 vessels per hour all day on weekends.

Nearly indistinguishable species Procambarus vioscai Identification An individual crayfish can be identified to a group of a few species within the genus and subgenus Procambarus (Pennides) by looking at a few distinguishing characteristics. Two pairs of cervical spines, a broadly open areola, and lateral rostral spines are diagnostic physical features that characterize P. natchitochae, P. vioscai, P. dupratzi, and P. pentastylus from other species of crayfish. Color is not always a reliable characteristic in identification, but P. natchitochae (and the three other species above) generally have a dark brown saddle on the posterior part of the carapace and dark lateral stripes on the abdomen. Form I male gonopod characteristics or collection location are required for species level identification. Conservation status Procambarus natchitochae live in streams and ditches with flowing current, clear to cloudy water, and rocky to sandy substrates. The species is endemic to the United States and is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN. NatureServe gives P. natchitochae a global rating of G5, or 'secure', and a national ranking of N5 for 'secure', while at the state level, Louisiana ranks it as S4, for 'Apparently secure', and Arkansas and Texas rate it as SNR, or 'State Not Ranked'. The American Fisheries Society ranks it as 'Currently Stable'. Conservation assessment is lacking for this species because there are little available data on the population or threats, other than the current species distribution. History The P. natchitochae holotype, allotype, and morphotype were collected from a tributary of Spring Creek at Melder, on State Route 85, in Rapides Parish, Louisiana.

He is most noted for being the lead singer and the founder of the R&B; band The Contours in 1959. The Contours was best known for its 1962 hit single, \\"Do You Love Me\\". Early life Joseph Billingslea, Jr. was born on November 14, 1937 in Hamtramck, Michigan. Before his first birthday, his parents moved to Detroit where he was raised. He sang with the boys' choir while attending Chadsey High School where he graduated in 1954. After graduation, he enlisted in the United States Air Force. While stationed in the Maine, Billingslea formed a vocal group with four other airmen called the \\"Revere Tone Five\\". After receiving an honorable discharge following his four- year stint, he returned to Detroit in 1958. Career Upon his return from the air force in 1958, Billingslea was invited by an old high school friend, Billy Gordon, to join his singing group, \\"The Majestics\\". In 1958, the group disbanded, so Billingslea and Gordon decided to form a new vocal group. Billingslea placed a want-ad in the local newspaper looking for singers. Billy Hoggs responded to the ad and became the group's third member. At Hoggs' recommendation, his friend Billy Rollins, became the fourth member of a group they named \\"The Blenders\\". Within weeks, Rollins was replaced with another friend of Hoggs, Leroy Fair. In 1959, Hubert Johnson was added, making the group a quintet. At Billingslea's suggestion, the group renamed itself \\"The Contours\\". That same year, the group signed a recording contract with Motown. The group released two records in 1960 and 1961 but got their big break in 1962 when the single Do You Love Me was recorded on Motown's newest label, \\"Gordy\\". Within two weeks of its release, the song was at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100, taking the #1 spot on the R&B; charts and #3 on the pop charts. It remained on the charts for five months. The song was the Gordy label's first million-seller, and it still holds the record as Motown's fastest rising hit of all time. In 1963, Billingslea and the group charted another hit, sending Shake Sherry to the #21 position on the R&B; charts (#43 pop). In 1964, they released Can You Do It which reached #41 on the R&B; charts. Still in 1964, they recorded a ballad entitled That Day When She Needed Me. Billingslea, along with Hoggs, Johnson and fellow Contours member Sylvester Potts, departed from Motown in 1964. The group had creative differences with Motown and left. Later years After leaving Motown, circa 1964, Billingslea took a job for the Chrysler Corporation at the Dodge Truck Plant in Warren, Michigan. In 1965, he was elected by his fellow United Automobile Workers as chief steward. He resigned from Chrysler in 1968 to join the Wayne County Sheriff's Department. In 1977, he put his years of law enforcement experience to work by joining the Detroit Correctional Department, eventually reaching the rank of Sergeant. In 1972 he returned to the GM studio in Detroit to work with Michael Stokes and Joe Thomas on a project for Sussex Records that appeared as The Segments of Time. In 1971, Billingslea reunited The Contours. The group, and Billingslea with it, play across the country even today. There have also been several new additions to the group. Personal life Billingslea has seven children; four sons and three daughters. His youngest son, LaMark Jefferson Billingslea, was murdered in 2012. On January 1, 2012, LaMark, the manager of HR's Lounge (a nightclub in Detroit), was killed while breaking up a fight between patrons at the club. At around 1:30 am, LaMark was shot in the neck by an unidentified shooter. LaMark died at a local hospital at the age of 39.

Although baculoviruses infect only invertebrates in nature, ectopic expression of P35 in vertebrate animals and cells also results in inhibition of apoptosis, thus indicating a universal mechanism. P35 has been shown to be a caspase inhibitor with a very wide spectrum of activity both in regard to inhibited caspase types and to species in which the mechanism is conserved. Species distribution P35 has been found in different strains of the nuclear polyhedrosis virus, a species of baculovirus that infects insects. Two orthologs of P35 that have been studied in detail are the ones from the Autographa californica multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV) and from the Bombyx mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus (BmNPV). The P35 ortholog from AcMNPV was found to block apoptosis in mammalian cells much more efficiently as compared to the ortholog from BmNPV.  Function  The P35 protein inhibits apoptosis by acting as a competitive, irreversible inhibitor of caspases. P35 first serves as a caspase substrate and is cleaved between the amino acids D87 and G88, i.e. after the sequence DQMD in P35 from AcMNPV and after the sequence DKID in P35 from BmNPV, resulting in two polypeptide products of about 10 kDa and 25 kDa in size. The cleavage site is situated in a solvent-exposed loop that extends from the protein's beta sheet core, thus ensuring good accessibility to the caspase. However, unlike other caspase substrate proteins, the fragments of P35 do not dissociate from the caspase after cleavage. Instead, the N-terminal, 10 kDa cleavage fragment remains bound to the caspase by a covalent, stable thioester bond between the cleavage residue D87 of P35 and the cysteine residue at the active site of the caspase. While the formation of a thioester intermediate between the aspartate of the substrate's recognition site and the cysteine of the caspase's active site is a normal event in caspase-mediated protein cleavage, the resulting bond is normally quickly hydrolysed so that the cleaved products can detach. In the case of P35, however, the caspase-substrate complex remains stable. Cleavage of P35 triggers rapid conformational changes that reposition its N-terminus, which is normally buried in the protein's beta-sheet core, to the caspase's active site. As a consequence of this rearrangement, the N-terminal P35 residues C2 and V3 interact with the caspase's active site to displace water and prevent the hydrolysis reaction. The P35 residue C2 competes with the caspase's active site cysteine residue for binding of the P35 residue D87, keeping the reaction trapped in an equilibrium state.  Interactions  In insect cells, P35 inhibits an enzyme called Sf caspase-1, which was identified as a structural and functional ortholog of human CASP3 (CPP32) and CASP7 (MCH3). Studies using purified human caspases in vitro found that the protein is able to also inhibit several of these, including CASP1, CASP3, CASP6, CASP7, CASP8, and CASP10. Clinical significance Since baculoviridae infect only insects and not humans, the function of P35 in the immune evasion of infected cells is not clinically relevant. However, P35 has been considered as a potential tool in gene therapy to suppress apoptosis where it is not wanted, such as in the protection of transplanted tissue from immune rejection or in the killing of bystander cells in cancer therapy; such methods are still far from clinical application though. History and discovery The role of P35 in the inhibition of apoptosis was first described by Rollie J. Clem in the research group of Lois K. Miller at the Department of Genetics at the University of Georgia in 1991. Four years later, in 1995, the reason for apoptosis inhibition by P35 was identified as its ability to bind and inhibit caspases (then still called ICE homologs) by Nancy J. Bump and co-workers at the BASF Bioresearch Corporation in Worcester, Massachusetts. The mechanism of caspase inhibition was discovered by Guozhou Xu in the team of Hao Wu at the Department of Biochemistry at Weill Cornell Medical College in 2001.

Trained as a sculptor at the Art Students League of New York, he designed and made wooden ware in the New York City metropolitan area, and later in rural Pennsylvania where he lived alone and used his barn as a workshop. Participating in many woodworking, craft, and design exhibits of his day, his works are in the Smithsonian American Art Museum and Renwick Gallery, the Yale Art Gallery, the Center for Art in Wood, the Museum of Art and Design, and many private collections. Once prominent in midcentury modern design, Milan slipped into obscurity after his death.Gordon, B., Sartorius, N., and Jurus, P. (2010). Emil Milan: The (re)-introduction of a seminal American woodworker. Woodwork, Winter 2010, PPP. 64-68. His legacy has been revived by an extensive biographical research project that has led to renewed interest in his life, work, and influence.  Early life and education  Milan was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey and graduated from Abraham Clark High School in Roselle in 1940.Sartorius, N., Gordon, B., and Jurus, P. (2011). The Emil Milan Research Project. Chapter on military service. p.1 (separately paginated). Report available from the Center for Craft, Creativity, and Design, Asheville, NC. He took up wood carving at an early age and learned shop skills from his father, who was an industrial welder. Attesting to his skill, one of his teachers paid him to carve a small wooden cow for her veterinarian brother.Worthington, K. (1979) Interview with Emil Milan, Sullivan Review, March 29, 1979. He enlisted in the US Army in 1942, served as a Military Policeman in Europe during WWII, landing on Omaha Beach just after the invasion and advancing across France with the 1st Army. During that time, he continued occasional carving and produced provocative female figures for his fellow soldiers that he called \\"3D Pinups.\\"Research Project Report, 2011, Chapter on \\"Military Service\\" (separately paginated), p.2-4 He was honorably discharged in Monmouth, NJ on November 17, 1945.

(1972) Jose de Creeft. New York: Da Capo Press. Appendix (unpaginated). Figures 229-258.  Early career  After leaving the Art Students League in 1951, Milan continued carving figural works and what he called ‚Äúfunctional sculpture‚Äù in wood (bowls, trays, spoons, and other accessories) at his parents' home in Roselle. During that time he met Myra and Stan Buchner who were forming a new craft association called New Jersey Designer Craftsmen, and he began selling his works in the group‚Äôs Christmas shows. The annual Christmas exhibition at the Newark Museum of Art was also a major sales outlet for Milan between 1953 and 1964.Research Project Report (2011). Five page section of the Newark Museum of Art Christmas Shows. A cutting board with a scoop and a carved bowl made by Milan were selected for the landmark exhibit Designer Craftsmen, USA 1953.Designer Craftsmen USA. Exhibit Guide. (1953). The exhibit toured the Brooklyn Museum, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the San Francisco Museum of Art from October, 1953 through August, 1954, then traveled throughout the United States for a year. In 1953, the Buchners partnered with David Kittredge to form a woodworking business called Buckridge Contemporary Design, located in Orange, NJ. Milan was the designer, set up and ran the shop, and supervised a small group of workers. The shop produced functional wooden tableware and decorative art in wood, notably stylized fish and birds.Buckridge Contemporary Design (video). www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgUQvGh7qAs These works were sold in specialty shops and department stores in the New York City metropolitan area. Hammacher Schlemmer, for example, marketed a Table Talk line of wooden ware crafted by Milan.Hammacher-Schlemmer ad for ‚ÄúTable Talk‚Äù woodenware. New Yorker magazine, October 30, 1954 Other retailers included Bonniers, McCutcheons, and Saks Fifth Avenue.

The business was disbanded by late 1959. In 1957, a carved tray and two spoons by Emil Milan appeared in the Design Wood exhibit at the Museum of Contemporary Craft (now Museum of Art and Design) in New York City. The three works were purchased by the American Craft Council for the Museum's permanent collection.Museum of Art and Design, permanent collection.

Honduras 1964‚Äì65  In fall 1964, Milan joined noted furniture makers Joyce and Edgar Anderson and designer Gere Kavanaugh for several months in Honduras in a USAID program. The goal was to train local people to make products from indigenous woods for sale in the US market. He designed prototypes of functional and art objects as teaching aids and taught woodworking in Tegucigalpa.Oral history interview with Joyce and Edgar Anderson, September 17‚Äì19, 2002.

Emil was an invited participant and demonstrator at a conference entitled Wood ‚Äô79: The State of the Art, held on the campus on SUNY Purchase October 5‚Äì7, 1979.The event focused on studio furniture and high end woodworking and attracted more than 400 participants, including many leading woodworkers of the day.Kelsy, John. Review of the Wood ‚Äô79 conference. Woodworking Magazine, Jan/Feb 1980. In August 1980, the only solo show of Emil Milan‚Äôs work in his lifetime was held at Robert Stark‚Äôs Susquehanna Studio in Uniondale, PA.  Use of wood and other materials  Throughout his career, Milan used a wide range of woods including domestic hardwoods such as maple, walnut, and black cherry, as well as exotic imported species such as zebrawood, padouk, cocobolo, bubinga, lapacho, and rosewood.Craft Horizons, 1957. p.37 Buckridge items made from imported woods commanded higher prices.Research Project Report, 2011, Buckridge wholesale price list.

He periodically capitalized on grain patterns, intensive figure, and contrasting heartwood and sapwood colors as design elements in his works.Craft Horizons, 1957, p.37Gordon et al. 2010. p.68 Silver components occasionally were added to functional wooden works, and he made a few cheese boards with flat ceramic inserts as cutting surfaces.Research Project Report, 2011, Chapter on 'Secondary Market\\" (separate pagination) p.3 He was frugal with wood and used scraps to make saleable functional and art objects. Cutouts from large bowl forms, for example, were used to make fish, birds, and abstract sculptures, and the remaining pieces were used to make small salt bowls and spoons.Gordon et al., 2010, p.67 File:twotonebowl.jpg Two tone Padouk bowl File:EmilMilanJacarandaBirds.jpg Jacaranda birds File:EmilMilanWalnutBird.jpg Walnut bird File:nutbowlsilver.jpg Nut bowl with silver base File:cheeseboardinsert.jpg Cheese board with ceramic insert  Tools and techniques  Milan was an innovator in woodworking methods and a pioneer in advocating the integrated use of hand and power tools, focusing on the excellence of the final product.\\"Circle of Influence,\\" American Art Collector, January 2015 (Issue 111). p. 165 An article in the American Craft Council's magazine Craft Horizons in 1957 featured Milan's use of both hand tools and power tools to ‚Äú...still achieve a handmade look.‚Äù ‚Äô‚ÄôCraft Horizons‚Äô‚Äô 1957. p. 38 A sequence of pictures showed how he used a drill press to rapidly remove wood inside concave parts of bowls, trays, and spoons. He would then refine the roughed out concave forms with a mallet and wood gouges, before power sanding with flexible disk attachments‚Äîthus using a power tool, hand tools, and then another power tool in rapid succession. He devised tools and techniques for increasing speed and efficiency without sacrificing workmanship. He made flat templates of his commonly produced works to rapidly transfer outlines onto wood blanks. A 12-station duplicating machine was in use at the Buckridge shop to quickly rough out multiple copies of production items. He had several tools made for him by blacksmiths at Peter‚Äôs Valley Craft Center, for example, and in at least one case made a wooden prototype of a specialized gouge to communicate his exact requirements.Research Project Report, Interview with Vincent Bilotta, May 2, 2011. Milan designed and built a multipurpose drum- and belt-sander, dubbed the ‚ÄúEmil Machine‚Äù by his woodworking colleagues.Research Project Report, 2011, Chapter on \\"Methods of work.\\" p.7 It had interchangeable pneumatic drums of different sizes and a long slack belt. The tension on the belt could be adjusted to achieve a shape that matched the outside curve of a work. A detachable plate could be installed below the upper belt to sand flat surfaces. These power sanding methods were used to rapidly shape the work and to refine and smooth the piece before applying lacquer or linseed oil. A crude slack belt sanding machine, possibly designed and built by Milan, was in use at the Buckridge shop in the 1950s.Research Project Report. 2011. Chapter \\"A study in contrasts.\\" p. 6 He routinely used the bandsaw as a carving tool, standing a slab up on edge and slicing off long thin curves of wood in closer and closer approximation of the final desired form.Gordon et al. (2010). p.66 This risky procedure violates basic safety tenets of bandsaw use that insist that the stock must have a stable flat surface held firmly against the table.Duginske, M. (2007). ‚ÄúBandsaw Safety Procedures‚Äù in The new complete guide to the bandsaw (p.9). Fox Chapel Publishing, East Petersburg, PA. He demonstrated his sanding and bandsaw techniques to other professional woodworkers at the Wood '79 conference held at SUNY Purchase, October 5‚Äì7, 1979.  Later life and death  Milan continued to live alone in Thompson PA in the 1980s, but his health began to deteriorate. He died April 5, 1985 (age 62) and is buried in Thompson, PA.  Recent interest and exhibits  Interest in Emil Milan has been renewed in recent years due to a biographical research project funded by the Center for Craft, Creativity, and Design that yielded an extensive archival report documenting Emil‚Äôs life and work,Shaykett, J. (2011). Unearthing the Story of Emil Milan: A Research Project with Heart. American Craft Council, Minneapolis, MN. craftcouncil.org/post/unearthing-story-emil- milan-research-project-heart and an article in Woodwork magazine in 2010.Gordon, B., et al, 2010, Woodwork magazine. Since then, there has been increased media attention, two major exhibits, and an academic symposium focused on Milan. An exhibit entitled Emil Milan: Midcentury Designer Craftsman was held at the Henry Gallery on the campus of Penn State Great Valley in Malvern, PA June 9 ‚Äì September 26, 2014. The first solo exhibit of Milan‚Äôs works in over 30 years, it included 88 objects curated by Phil Jurus, Barry Gordon, and Norm Sartorius. The exhibit was previewed in Woodwork magazine in January 2014Gordon, B. (2014) Emil Milan Exhibit.

The sect is part of the Salafi Movement which was founded a few hundred years ago.  History  The importer Ma Debao (1867‚Äì1977), when he undertook the Hajj, was influenced by the Salafi movement in Mecca. Upon his return to China he began to preach the Salafi ideology. The movement criticizes innovative Islam. It opposes new movements which it believes are against the Sunnah. It opposes the influence of no-sunna Chinese culture on Islam. The sect was firstly import in Hezhou of Gansu province but now spread in many places notably Ningxia, Qinghai, Yunnan, Tianjing with support of Saudi religious organizations.Sects And Legal Schools Represented By Muslims In China Ma Debao and Ma Zhengqing promoted Salafism as the main form of Islam. But it was opposed by a number of Hui Muslim sects such as the Gedimu, Sufi Khafiya and Jahriyya, to the extent that even the fundamentalist Yihewani (Ikhwan) Chinese sect, founded by Ma Wanfu after Salafi inspiration, condemned Ma Debao and Ma Zhengqing as heretics. They were branded traitors and Wahhabi teachings were deemed as heresy by the Yihewani leaders. The Kuomintang Sufi Muslim General Ma Bufang, who backed the Yihewani (Ikhwan) Muslims, persecuted the Salafis and forced them into hiding. They were not allowed to move or worship openly. The Yihewani had become secular and Chinese nationalists; they considered the Salafiyya to be \\"heterodox\\" (xie jiao) and people who followed foreigners' teachings (waidao). After the Communists took power, Salafis were allowed to worship openly again. Even among Hui Salafis and Uyghur Salafis, there is little coordination or cooperation and the two take totally different political agendas, with the Hui Salafists content to carry out their own teachings and remain politically neutral.

A large crowd of Islamic extremists formed in the streets around her claiming that she had burned the Quran, and for that, her accusers announced that she must be sent to Hell right away. Police initially tried to protect her and disperse the radical mob, but were overwhelmed by the mob's number and fury. She was savagely beaten and killed after allegedly arguing with a mullah who falsely accused her of burning the Quran. Later police investigations revealed that she had not done so. Her murder led to 49 arrests; three adult men received twenty-year prison sentences, eight other adult males received sixteen year sentences, a minor received a ten-year sentence, and eleven police officers received one-year prison terms for failing to protect her. Her murder and the subsequent protests served to draw attention to women's rights in Afghanistan. A memorial to her has been built in Kabul with support of the Solidarity Party of Afghanistan. Background Like many in Afghanistan, Farkhunda was an observant Muslim who wore a veil (hijab). At the time of the attack, she had just finished a degree in religious studies and was preparing to take a teaching post. Her name means \\"auspicious\\" and \\"jubilation\\" in Persian language. The attack In a still frame from a video captured and widely disseminated on social media and in the news, a bloodied Farkhunda appears to plead with her attackers before she is knocked down. Farkhunda when beaten Farkhunda had previously been arguing with a mullah named Zainuddin, in front of Shah-Do Shamshira Mosque where she worked as a religious teacher, about his practice of selling amulets. During this argument, Zainuddin reportedly accused her of burning the Quran. She responded > \\"I am a Muslim, and Muslims do not burn the Quran!\\" Hundreds of angry radicals flocked to the shrine upon overhearing the mullah's accusation. Police arrived and attempted to lead Farkhunda to a local precinct building one mile away, but she refused, asking for a female police officer to accompany her. The mob was able to drag Farkhunda away into the street where they knocked her to the ground and began beating and kicking her. More police arrived, firing warning shots into the air and temporarily dispersing the crowd. They moved her into the Shah-Do Shamshira Mosque in an attempt to shield her. As the crowd grew in size and rumors that she was working with Americans began circulating, the mob attempted to storm the shrine's walls. Police hoisted her onto the roof of the building in an escape attempt, but Farkhunda suddenly slipped and fell into the crowd. The mob dragged Farkhunda into the street and savagely beat and stomped her. She was bludgeoned with sticks and rocks outside the mosque, then placed into the road and run over with a car, dragging her body 300 feet. Police offered no resistance, and directed traffic around the scene. The mob then dragged her body to the nearby bank of the Kabul River, took turns stoning her and set her on fire; her body was soaked in blood and would not burn, so the crowd ripped off articles of their own clothing to ignite and maintain the fire. The mob shouted the Takbir during the lynching. Farkhunda's parents said the killing was instigated by the mullah Farkhunda had been speaking to. According to Tolo News he loudly accused her of burning the Quran \\"in order to save his job and life.\\" An eyewitness said that the mob was chanting anti-American and anti-democratic slogans while beating Farkhunda. The mob was captured on video accusing of her of working with Americans, and of being a French embassy worker. Reactions Public reaction in Afghanistan A number of prominent public officials turned to Facebook immediately after the death to endorse the murder. A spokesman for the Kabul police Hashmat Stanekzai, wrote that Farkhunda ‚Äúthought, like several other unbelievers, that this kind of action and insult will get them U.S. or European citizenship. But before reaching their target, they lost their life.‚Äù After it was revealed that she did not burn the Quran, the public reaction in Afghanistan turned to shock and anger. Hundreds of protesters took to the streets of Kabul on 23 March protesting her brutal death. Protesters marched from where the attack began to where Farkhunda was thrown in the river. A number of women on the march wore masks of her bloodied face while others condemned the government for failing to bring security to Afghanistan. Shukria Barakzai, a member of parliament representing Kabul Province and a longtime women‚Äôs rights activist, told Al Jazeera that her killing had triggered the city and the rest of the country to think about women's rights. She said: \\"This is not a male or female issue, this is a human issue and we will not stop until the killers are brought to justice.\\" Roshan Siren, a former member of parliament, said that the murder highlights violence against women in the country, and has become a rallying point for a younger generation of women to campaign for \\"the protection and progress of women.\\" The woman's father complained that police could have done more to save Farkhunda. Protests On March 23, hundreds of women protested the attack, demanding that the government prosecute those responsible for Farkhunda's murder. The protest was organized by Solidarity Party of Afghanistan and residents of Kabul. Farkhunda's murder has also become a rallying point for women's rights activists in Afghanistan. On March 24, thousands of people protested the attack in front of the Afghan Ministry of Justice in Kabul. Bloomberg, Unprecedented Afghan Protest After Woman Killed Over Koran, 24-03-2015, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-24/unprecedented- afghan-protest-after-woman-killed-over-koran On April 27, Leena Alam and her co- actors re-enacted the attack during a protest in Kabul, in what Afghan observers called an unprecedented case of a public theatrical performance commemorating a woman's murder. Official response in Afghanistan Afghan president Ashraf Ghani ordered an investigation into the incident and, in a statement released by his office, condemned the \\"act of extreme violence\\". He described the killing as \\"heinous\\". He also said that Farkhunda's murder revealed that Afghanistan's police were too focused on the Taliban insurgency in the country and not focused enough on local policing. Nine men who were seen in the video of Farkhunda's murder on social media were subsequently detained. The Interior Ministry later reported that 28 people were arrested and 13 police officers suspended as part of investigations. Hashmat Stanikzai, an official spokesman for the Kabul police who publicly endorsed the murder, was sacked over comments that he made on social media supporting Farkhunda's killers. The Afghanistan Ministry of Hajj and Religious Affairs announced that it found no evidence that Farkhunda had burned the Quran.  International reaction  International Attorney Kimberley Motley represented Farkhunda's family in the first court. After the first court hearing Motley stated that Farkhunda's trial was a defining moment for women's rights in Afghanistan. In the first hearing, Motley indicated that there were twenty-two convictions which included four death sentences, eight people were given sixteen years in prison, and ten police officers were convicted for their failure in protecting Farkhunda. Due to pressures that Motley and the family received from the Afghan Government she did not represent the family in the subsequent court hearings. In a \\"secret\\" Appellate Court Hearing and when the death sentences were overturned in a secret hearing held 43 days after Motley termed the ruling as \\"shocking.\\" Motley further stated that, \\"The rule of law is the foundation of any civilised society. If the courts don‚Äôt get this decision right then you have to ask how serious it is about progressing the rights of women. Justice for Farkhunda is a reflection of how women will be treated in Afghanistan in the future. In a scathing op-ed Motley wrote, \\"Promises of a transparent legal process were once again shattered by the Afghan judiciary. This week, its precipitous decision regarding the Farkhunda case was leaked from a \\"secret\\" hearing in the Appellate Court. Blatantly disregarding the law, the court decided that the men convicted of having a primary role in Farkhunda's horrific death were entitled to a reduction in their sentence. Assertions of corruption mean absolutely nothing if those that are in power - like the Appellate Court judges - are allowed to continue to perpetrate such legal atrocities. The inability of the judiciary to handle Farkhunda's case in a fair and equal manner simply reinforces questions about its commitment to progress the status of women in Afghanistan.\\" The European Union condemned the attack. A spokeswoman for European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said in a statement that \\"the killing of Ms. Farkhunda... is a tragic reminder of dangers women face from false accusations and the lack of justice in Afghanistan.\\" She added, \\"We all hope that [those] responsible can be brought to justice.\\" The United States also condemned the murder, with a statement from its embassy in Kabul calling for \\"those responsible to be brought to justice so such heinous acts will never occur again\\". State-run tabloid Global Times columnist Farman Nawaz wrote \\"Choosing rulers through the ballot box is a positive sign for the country, but the survival, and even growth, of extremist mentality even after suffering from the barbarism of extremist groups reflects a critical failure by Afghan political parties\\". Afghan American historian Ali A Olomi argued that Farkhunda's murder demonstrated the endurance of an underlying culture of violence and devaluation of human life that comes out of generations of Afghans being raised during a war and facing oppression. Reaction from Islamic scholars =In Afghanistan= The day after the murder, certain imams and mullahs endorsed the killing during Friday prayer services in their mosques. One of them, the influential Maulavi Ayaz Niazi of the Wazir Akbar Khan mosque, warned the government that any attempt to arrest the men who had \\"defended the Quran\\" would lead to an uprising. After it was revealed she did not burn the Quran, senior Islamic scholars in Afghanistan expressed outrage over the incident. Ahmad Ali Jebreili, a member of Afghanistan's Ulama Council set for administering Islamic law, condemned the attack, accusing it of contravening Islam. Haji Noor Ahmad, a local cleric, said \\"People come and execute a person arbitrarily; this is totally prohibited and unlawful. However, some justified her killing and were met with public anger.\\" =Abroad= Abu Ammaar Yasir Qadhi, a prominent, conservative, Islamic scholar, expressed horror on his Facebook page and said \\"A sign of how truly civilized a nation is, is how it treats its women. May Allah restore the honor and respect that women deserve in our societies!\\" Yama Rasaw of the International Policy Digest blamed intolerance among Afghans and Muslims for the killing of Farkhunda. Funeral On March 22, a number of women, dressed in black, carried Farkhunda's coffin from an ambulance to a prayer ground and then to a graveyard in Chaikhana, a northern neighborhood of Kabul. This was a marked departure from tradition, which holds that such funerals are typically only attended by men. At the end of 2015, it was reported that Farkhunda's grave was half-finished. Criminal cases Of 49 suspects tried in the case, four men were originally sentenced to death for their roles in Farkhunda's lynching. The sentences were handed down by Judge Safiullah Mojadedi in Kabul on May 5, 2015. Eight other defendants were sentenced to 16 years in prison. The trial was noted for its unusual brevity, lasting just two days. The verdict has been criticized because although some investigators believe a fortuneteller set the attacks on Farkhunda in motion, this person was found not guilty on appeal. According to Judge Mojadedi, three suspects in the lynching were still at large at the time of the May 5 sentencing. On May 19, 2015, eleven police officers including the local district police chief were sentenced to one year in prison for failing to protect Farkhunda. On July 2, 2015, an appeals court overturned the capital punishment of the four men condemned in the lynching. Three of those had their sentences reduced to 20 years in jail, while the fourth was re-sentenced to 10 years prompting street protests and a debate on women's rights. The chief of police and a caretaker of the Shah-Do Shamshira shrine where the murder occurred were acquitted. In August 2015, an examination of the outcome of the proceedings in the matter by a panel of lawyers appointed by President Ashraf Ghani resulted in a planned recommendation to the Supreme Court of Afghanistan that those accused in her death be retried. On March 19, 2016, the Women's Political Participation Committee, an Afghan civil society organization, called for reevaluation of the Supreme Court's decisions with more transparency. Supreme Court of Afghanistan *Zainuddin was \\"the custodian of a holy shrine who trafficked in Viagra, condoms and pagan amulets, and who, when exposed, falsely accused a young woman named Farkhunda of burning a Quran.\\" His sentence was reduced from capital punishment to 20 years, which are to be served in the Pul-e-Charkhi prison. *Sharaf Baghlani served as an agent of the Afghan National Directorate of Security (NDS). His sentence was also reduced from capital punishment to 20 years in the same prison. *Abdul Basheer was the man who drove his vehicle over Farkhunda. His sentence was also reduced from capital punishment to 20 years in prison. *Muhammad Yaqoub, who claimed to be 17 years old at the time of the crime, must serve only 10 years due to being a minor.

The poem focuses on the theme of religious persecution and the corrupted dictates of dogmatic Church teachings. As part of Songs of Experience the poem is set in the wider context of exploring the suffering of innocent and oppressed individuals‚Äîin this case a young boy, and his parents‚Äîwithin a flawed society that is oppressed and disillusioned with life's experience. The poem Analysis of the poem In this poem, Blake's titular character, a little boy, appears, by lights of Church pedantry, to have questioned religious dogma, to wit: that every person must love God more than themselves or any other; for his sacrilege the boy has instantly become \\"lost\\" to the Church. Reacting to his speech, a zealot Priest leaps to denounce the boy and to dramatize his offense. The little boy is peremptorily castigated as a heretic and summarily burned at the stake, even though the child's age‚Äîhe is a little boy, after all; he sees the world through the eyes of a child's innocence‚Äîwould seemingly preclude him from comprehending the awful construing of his words (by the Priest) as heresy. On the other hand, a reader might theorize that Blake intends to portray the child as precocious and with intentions to dissent from Church teaching‚Äîperhaps the Priest thinks so. However, the actual words applied by the author to the boy's speech offers very little toward this view; instead, it is the child's innocent candor that seems to inspire his words. Background It appears the author has drawn the ‚ÄúPriest‚Äù as not merely a parish priest but as metaphor for the hierarchical powers-that-be of the Church. Certainly Blake seems to hearken back to the time when the Church wielded almost unchecked powers throughout England (and most of Europe) to judge and destroy anyone it deemed intolerable in thought or behaviour. Blake wrote his poetry for the common man.  Structure The poem is divided into six quatrains, all in iambic tetrameter. The first quatrain introduces the subject of love of self in the voice of an omniscient narrator; the language is highly stylized. The second quatrain is the much simpler speech of a little boy expressing his thoughts on love of God, of others, and of nature.

The motto was chosen by the Dean of the NATO Council Andr√© de Staercke to reflect the spirit of consultation envisioned by the then-Secretary General of NATO Paul- Henri Spaak.

It was built to the designs of the architect Daniel Rollinson Hill and consecrated on 14 December 1835. An unfortunate incident happened on Good Friday in 1850 when the congregation were overcome by fumes from the stoves used for warming the church. The church became a parish in its own right in 1853 when land was assigned from Holy Trinity Church, Sutton Coldfield. Part of the parish was taken to form a new parish of All Saints' Church, Four Oaks in 1890. In 1908 the chancel had been replaced with a new one by the architect Charles Edward Bateman, who also provided transepts, an organ loft and new vestries. The intention was to rebuild the rest of the church to match, but the scheme was never brought to conclusion. Organ The church contained an organ by Forster and Andrews. The opening recital was given on 7 June 1853. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

Wards in dark grey were not contested in 2014. The 2014 Craven District Council election took place on 22 May 2014 to elect members of Craven District Council in North Yorkshire, England. One third of the council was up for election and the Conservative party stayed in overall control of the council. After the election, the composition of the council was as follows: *Conservative 18 *Independent 9 *Liberal Democrats 2 *Vacant 1 Background After the last election in 2012 the Conservatives had a 2-seat majority with 16 councillors, compared to 10 independents and 4 Liberal Democrats. The Conservative majority was increased in 2013 when the independent councillor for Hellifield and Long Preston Chris Moorby joined the Conservatives. By the time of the 2014 election a further seat was vacant after the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Polly English, meaning that before the election the council had 17 Conservative, 9 independent and 3 Liberal Democrat councillors. 9 seats were contested in 2014 with no candidates from the Liberal Democrats standing, even in Aire Valley with Lothersdale where the Liberal Democrat councillor for the previous 12 years, Mark Wheeler stood down at the election. However Labour for the first time in many years put up candidates for all 9 seats contested, despite not holding any seats on the council before the election. The Conservatives stood in 8 seats, just not standing in Sutton-in-Craven against independent councillor, Stephen Place, who was allied with the Conservatives. Other candidates included a further two independents, including sitting councillor Philip Barrett, and one candidate from the UK Independence Party. Election result Only one seat changed hands at the election with the Conservatives gaining a seat from the Liberal Democrats to have 18 councillors. The Conservative gain came in Aire Valley with Lothersdale where Patrick Mulligan picked up the seat vacated by Liberal Democrat Mark Wheeler to become the only new councillor after the election. This reduced the Liberal Democrats to 2 seats on the council, while there remained 9 independents and 1 seat was vacant in Skipton West. Ward results By-elections between 2014 and 2015 A by-election was held in Skipton West on 2 July 2014 after the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Polly English. The seat was gained for Labour by Peter Madeley with a majority of 42 votes over Liberal Democrat Edward Walker. The victory meant Peter Madeley became the first Labour councillor on Craven council since 1999.

He is the main antagonist of the series' first part, Phantom Blood, appearing in the debut chapter , published in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump in 1987. He later returns, known simply as DIO, as the main antagonist of the series' third part, Stardust Crusaders, now a powerful vampire and user of the time-stopping supernatural ability named The World. The poor son of an abusive alcoholic who worked his mother to death, Dio holds an inordinate amount of enmity toward others. As the series' most prolific villain, his defining trait is his staunch ambition, which manifests in a peerless desire for power, no matter the cost. In the alternate universe of the series' seventh part, Steel Ball Run, a character named bears resemblance to Dio and appears as a minor antagonist. Creation and design When beginning the series Dio is the character that Araki looked forward to drawing the most. He also revealed that he had not thought up a weakness for the character, and that it was difficult to come up with a way for Dio to be defeated. In regard to Dio's characterization, Araki said that he was inspired by FBI profiling of serial killers, admitting that in a way he thinks they must be incredibly strong to be able to commit the heinous crimes that they do. How serial killers control their victims through psychological manipulation interested Araki as well, a trait similar to how Dio uses his charisma to ensure his followers to do his bidding. The author intended to characterize Dio as unapologetically baleful in his pursuit of power, with his literal abandonment of his humanity reflecting his figurative and emotional one. Araki wanted his name to sound cool next to JoJo's, so he chose Dio, the Italian word for God. According to Araki, Dio's physical appearance is inspired by Rutger Hauer's character Roy Batty from the 1982 film Blade Runner. Dio's mannerisms, such as his frequent cries of and \\"WRYYY\\", have yielded several Internet memes and other popular culture references. Appearances Phantom Blood In Phantom Blood, the child of an abusive drunkard named Dario Brando, Dio Brando becomes the adopted brother of Jonathan Joestar by using the promise that George Joestar made to Dario years ago. Upon entering the Joestar estate after his father died, Dio wasted no time unequivocally making young Jonathan's life a living hell to take everything from him including abusing Jonathan's dog. Dio underestimated Jonathan's retaliation for forcefully kissing his beloved Erina Pendleton, spending the next seven years feigning to be Jonathan's friend before enacting his plan to steal the Joestar fortune by poisoning George with the same poison he used to kill Dario. When Jonathan investigates the matter for proof, Dio plots to use an ancient Aztec stone mask to murder Jonathan. However, Dio learns the mask transforms the wearer into a vampire when exposed to blood, and uses it on himself when his scheme is exposed. Although seemingly killed when Jonathan impales him on a stone statue and leaves him in the burning Joestar mansion, Dio survives, and proceeds to start his subjugation of England in the small village of Windknight's Lot, amassing sired followers to his cause. Jonathan is sought out by William Zeppeli, a master of an ancient martial art called Hamon, which can kill Vampires, and he teaches Jonathan how to use this ability as Dio sends other vampires and zombies in his pursuit to kill him so he can take over the world. Jonathan seemingly kills him once more, but Dio's head survives. With the help of his servant, Wang Chan, Dio attacks Jonathan on his honeymoon with Erina in an attempt to claim his enemy's body for his own. Despite having his throat fatally punctured by Dio, Jonathan is able to use Hamon one last time to overload the ship's engines, with Dio apparently destroyed in the resulting explosion. Erina, escaping unharmed with an orphaned girl, survives with their unborn son. Battle Tendency Dio Brando does not appear in Battle Tendency, but the aftermath of his apparent death at the hands of Jonathan Joestar affects the plot. It is ultimately revealed that Jonathan and Erina's son George Joestar II, a famed pilot of the Royal Air Force in World War I, was murdered by one of Dio's zombie henchmen who survived the battle of Knight's Lot and had infiltrated the RAF. George II's wife, the orphaned girl Elizabeth, hunted down this zombie and killed him with her Hamon. But as no one in the RAF knew that her victim was not human, she became a wanted murderer, Elizabeth was forced to go into hiding as Lisa Lisa with the help of the Speedwagon Foundation. Lisa Lisa would later encounter her son Joseph Joestar, teaching him Hamon so he can defeat the Pillar Man, Kars, whose creation of the Stone masks made him indirectly responsible for Dio's transformation. Stardust Crusaders It is revealed in Stardust Crusaders that Dio survived the ship's explosion and attached his head to Jonathan's headless body as the ship sank, confining himself in a casket at the bottom of the ocean for a century until a shipwreck salvage operation unintentionally retrieved him in 1983. Now known mononymously as \\"DIO\\", he soon meets the mystic Enya Geil who awakens his Stand, , allowing him to stop the passage of time around him. As his head is attached to Jonathan Joestar's body, Dio's acquisition of The World also awakens Stand abilities in all of Jonathan's living descendants. While Joseph Joestar and his grandson Jotaro Kujo have the resolve to control their Stands, Joseph's daughter and Jotaro's mother Holly has her very life sapped away from her own Stand because of her kind disposition. This spurs Jotaro and Joseph to track down Dio along with their friends Mohammed Avdol, Noriaki Kakyoin, Jean- Pierre Polnareff, and Iggy the Boston Terrier to kill him once and for all, freeing Holly from the curse the Stand has trapped her under. Dio responds by preemptively trying to assassinate the Joestars before they can find him in his lair in Cairo, sending other evil Stand users, some of whom he controlled mentally before they joined the Joestars on their journey. Along the way, Avdol and Iggy are killed by Dio's right-hand man Vanilla Ice, who in turn is killed by Polnareff. Dio kills Jotaro's friend Kakyoin in combat and temporarily kills Joseph after draining him of his blood, but Jotaro's own Stand Star Platinum proves to be The World's equally powered counterpart, and Jotaro's own rage at Dio being the cause of his friends' deaths and his mother's dwindling health leads him to kill Dio with Star Platinum. After the Speedwagon Foundation revive Joseph via blood transfusion from Jonathan's corpse, he and Jotaro take their ancestor's corpse out into the desert and expose it to sunlight, vanquishing Dio once and for all. Diamond Is Unbreakable and Golden Wind Dio is not present in either Diamond Is Unbreakable or Golden Wind, but his influence on the story is still present. In Diamond Is Unbreakable, it is revealed that Dio acquired his Stand by means of an ancient artifact known as the \\"Bow and Arrow\\", and this has reappeared in the fictional Japanese town of Morioh because the children of one of Dio's former lackeys, Mr. Nijimura are seeking out someone who can possibly free their father from the strange mutation he has suffered as a result of Dio's death. In Golden Wind, the protagonist Giorno Giovanna is Dio's son, but because Dio was in possession of Jonathan's body at the time of Giorno's conception, Giorno is biologically Jonathan's son and thus a member of the Joestar family, and his own virtuous soul prevents him from becoming evil as Dio was, thanks to his encounter with a heroic gangster in his childhood life. Stone Ocean Dio's influence on the JoJo story returns in Stone Ocean, where it is revealed that he met the story arc's main antagonist Father Enrico Pucci during the events of Stardust Crusaders. He told Father Pucci of his desire to use his Stand The World in order to reach \\"Heaven\\", and saw in the young priest a friendship that would help him achieve his goals. Father Pucci's reverence for Dio drives him to carry out his plans decades later, manipulating events to frame Jotaro Kujo's daughter Jolyne Cujoh for murder in order to trap her in the prison where he serves as a chaplain, using the final physical remains of Dio to evolve his Stand to reset reality in what he believes is Dio's vision of Heaven, a world where everyone knows their own destiny, and more importantly a world free of the Joestar bloodline. However, his hubris leads to his defeat at the hands of Jolyne's last surviving friend Emporio, who manages to reset reality back to what it once was, but not quite exactly the way it was before, as in this new version of the world, Pucci is missing instead of the Joestars. Steel Ball Run Dio Brando himself does not appear in Steel Ball Run, set in an alternate universe in 1890, but an alternate version of himself known as Diego Brando does. Diego Brando is, like his original counterpart, the child of an abusive household, and one who reveres his mother. She instilled in him a sense of pride that he took with him as he became a masterful jockey in his adulthood. When he decides to take part in the Steel Ball Run horse race across the United States, he winds up under the thrall of the Stand , transforming him into a dromaeosaurid dinosaur. As a result of this encounter, however, he gains his own Stand Scary Monsters, which grants him the same abilities that he now has under his control. Diego is hired by United States President Funny Valentine in his quest to seek out the pieces of the Saint's Corpse scattered along the race course, but after some time fighting against the heroes Johnny Joestar and Gyro Zeppeli, he realizes that President Valentine's plans are more dangerous to the world as a whole and joins the heroes in an attempt to stop him, only to die during his attempt to kill the evil President. Valentine then uses his Stand's powers to summon a Diego Brando from an alternate universe. This Diego Brando's possesses the same stand powers as Dio, thanks to having his own version of The World as a Stand. He manages to defeat Johnny Joestar in battle, and wins the Steel Ball Run, in addition to obtaining all of the Saint's Corpse and hiding it in a secure location, even though President Valentine has already been killed by Johnny in a fight. However, this alternate universe Diego meets his demise at the hands of Lucy Steel, who uses the skull of this universe's Diego Brando to obliterate his own head as a result of the effects of Valentine's Stand. Jojolion Dio makes a brief Cameo during the events of the \\"Endless Calamity\\" arc, along with the Stone Mask. In other media Dio Brando has appeared in many video games related to the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure franchise, usually as a player character or a boss. Some games include multiple versions of the character; in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Eyes of Heaven for example, both Dio Brando from Part 1 and Dio from Part 3 are playable characters, along with Diego Brando and Parallel World Diego from Part 7. Furthermore, he has appeared as a playable character in several crossover video games, such as Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars, and Jump Force. Dio is the main antagonist in the story mode of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Eyes of Heaven. Although the video game begins with the final scenes of Stardust Crusaders, the antagonist is a version of Dio from another universe who managed to beat the Joestar family. He seeks to control all universes by means of the Saint's Corpse, and uses his more advanced powers over time to bring all of the fallen heroes and villains back to life to serve him in preventing Jotaro Kujo and the other Joestars from obtaining all of the Saint's Corpse, or at least using them to gather the parts so he can steal them from them and achieve his ultimate power. This version of Dio is called and his Stand is called . Abilities Above all else, Dio Brando is known for his cunning and careful consideration. It is when Jonathan Joestar defies his expectations, defeating him in battle and thwarting his deliberate machinations, that Dio dons the Stone Mask that grants him the power of a vampire. He attains superhuman speed, regeneration, and strength insofar as he can lift a road roller with ease - a frequent source of references to Dio in popular culture. As a vampire, he most frequently uses an exaggerated evaporated cooling form of freezing known simply as the that allows him to freeze his opponents while rendering direct attacks with Hamon useless. While powerful, it does not kill people instantly (seen at the end of Phantom Blood, a victim of the attack survives the attack- although he died shortly after.) Another vampiric technique available to Dio is that allows him to shoot two pressurized fluid jets from his eyes. He can also graft body parts of different beings together, an ability he used to take Jonathan Joestar's headless body as his own. Once he returns 100 years later with Jonathan's body, Dio lost many of the abilities he had in his original body. Despite this, Dio's new zombified body enabled him to develop his signature Stand, The World, once it was pierced by the Bow and Arrow. As a psychic manifestation of Dio, it has all of his aforementioned superhuman abilities and facilitates melee attacks, though its signature ability is to stop time. This time-stopping ability only lasts for a limited amount of time (which in the anime adaptation of Stardust Crusaders is heavily exaggerated), though this limit can be extended through practice or through other means of increasing the user's strength (such as when Dio was able to increase his limit by several seconds after drinking Joseph Joestar's blood). Steel Ball Run Dio's Part 7 counterpart, Diego Brando, first encounters Scary Monsters when he comes into conflict with its original user Dr. Ferdinand, Ferdinand \\"infects\\" Diego, as well as an entire village, transforming them into dinosaurs. After gaining the Left Eye Corpse Part, Diego gains his own version of Scary Monsters that allows him to transform into a dinosaur, partially or entirely. Scary Monsters grants Diego increased strength, speed, and \\"dynamic vision\\", and retains the infection ability. After Diego's death by the hands of Funny Valentine, Valentine summons a Diego from an alternate universe. This Diego possesses The World like Part 3's Dio, and can also stop time. The design of Diego's The World is very similar to that of Part 3, apart from its skinnier profile and the replacement of the hearts on The World‚Äôs knees for capital Ds. Voice actors Dio has had many different voice actors in different types of media. He was first voiced by Norio Wakamoto in the 1992 drama CDs, followed by Nobuo Tanaka in the OVAs and Isshin Chiba in the 1998 video game. He is voiced by both Kenji Nojima and Hikaru Midorikawa in the Phantom Blood video game and 2007 animated film as the younger and older incarnations, respectively. In the 2012 television anime and in video games released since, he is voiced by Takehito Koyasu. Dio has only ever had two English voice actors; he was voiced by Kid Beyond in the OVAs, and by Patrick Seitz in the TV anime. Reception Dio has generally received praise from various reviewers of manga, anime, and other media; most praised his frightening and enjoyably hateable personality making an appealing antagonist, as well as his influence on the rest of the series. Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network notes that his far-reaching influence throughout the entire series works especially well as a stark contrast to his humble origins. Her colleague Jacob Chapman called him \\"one of the greatest supervillains ever invented in any medium.\\" Can Hoang Tran of The News Hub cites the anticipation of Dio's appearance in the 2014 reanimation of Stardust Crusaders to be a driving force of the series' success, later calling him the most rewarding character to play as in the series' video games. Joel Loynds of The Linc wrote \\"Dio's actions so powerfully and immediately establish his evil... that you will be invested in seeing his evolution even more than you [will be for JoJo]\\". Dallas Marshall of Green Tea Graffiti writes that Araki's straightforward intention of making the reader hate Dio worked simply and flawlessly, citing Dio's defining character moment as burning the protagonist's dog alive. Jun Yamamoto for Billboard said he \\"could almost feel the passion and ambition that Jonathan Joestar had in his fight against Dio\\" when listening to the first opening of the TV series. Readers of Anime News Network voted Dio number one in a poll of which anime villains would make the best friends in real life for his \\"cool composure\\" and \\"awesome lines\\". In February 2013, a life-size statue of Dio was displayed at Wonder Festival to promote the event. Starting in June 2014, Dio began appearing on cans of Japanese best-selling java Georgia coffee, as part of a special promotion of their Emerald Mountain Black flavor. Several characters in Japanese anime, manga, and video games draw inspiration from Dio. One such example is Sakuya Izayoi from the Touhou Project.

Yolanda Sald√≠var was a criminal trial held at the Harris County Criminal Courthouse in Downtown Houston, in the U.S. state of Texas. The trial began with the jury's swearing-in on October 9, through opening statements on October 12, to a verdict on October 23, 1995. Former nurse Yolanda Sald√≠var was tried on one count of first-degree murder after the shooting death of American Tejano music singer Selena on March 31, 1995, after which she held police and the FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit at bay for almost ten hours. The case has been described as the most important trial for the Hispanic population and was compared to the O. J. Simpson murder trial by media outlets. It was one of the most publicly followed trials in the history of the state of Texas. On April 3, Sald√≠var was arraigned and pleaded not guilty; saying that the shooting was accidental and that she had intended to commit suicide. Judge Mike Westergren, who presided over the case, appointed high-profile defense attorney Douglas Tinker and his team to appear for Sald√≠var. The public criticized prosecutor Carlos Valdez as an inexperienced criminal lawyer. The prosecution argued against the motion of change of venue from Corpus Christi, Texas, to Houston, while the defense believed that Selena's high-profile status in her hometown might result in a biased jury. The prosecution team called between forty-five and fifty witnesses including: Selena's father and manager of her music career Abraham Quintanilla Jr., Selena's widower Chris P√©rez, employees at Selena Etc. and at the Days Inn motel where the shooting occurred, a paramedic, several gun experts, the owners of the gun shop where Sald√≠var purchased the gun, emergency personnel, and Lloyd White who performed the autopsy. The defense team called fewer witnesses including: Sald√≠var's parents, former co-workers, motel staff at the Days Inn, Selena's former seventh-grade teacher, and the lead murder investigator. The evidence used in the trial included the gun used to kill Selena, the outfit Sald√≠var wore the day she claimed she was sexually assaulted, and the recorded conversations between FBI negotiators Larry Young and Issac Valencia, and Sald√≠var. The jury convicted Sald√≠var of first-degree murder after a two-hour deliberation, and she was sentenced to a maximum of life imprisonment with no eligibility for parole until March 2025. Fans outside the courtroom cheered the verdict. Many were seen expressing their delight at the outcome to Sald√≠var's parents and some wore T-shirts degrading to their daughter. There were more than two hundred accredited media representatives at the courthouse. The trial generated interest in Spain, Europe, South America, Australia and Japan. Tinker announced an appeal but it was denied by Westergren both in 1998 and 1999. Valdez published a book about the trial entitled: Justice for Selena: The State vs. Yolanda Sald√≠var in 2004. As of December 2014, Sald√≠var was representing herself in an attempt to be released from prison, claiming that some witnesses were not called during the trial, and that evidence went missing following the trial.  Background   Yolanda Sald√≠var  Sald√≠var, an in-home nurse for terminal cancer patients, was a fan of country music. However, she did enjoy Shelly Lares, a Tejano music artist, and disliked Selena for dominating award categories Sald√≠var's favorite musician was nominated in. In 1991, her niece persuaded her to go to a Selena concert in her hometown of San Antonio, Texas. Sald√≠var became a fan and decided to form a fan club promoting Selena. She contacted the singer's father and manager Abraham Quintanilla, Jr. seeking permission to start one. After a meeting with Quintanilla, Jr., he agreed to Sald√≠var's request, and she became the founder, and acting president, of the Selena fan club. In January 1994, Selena opened two boutiques in Texas, one in Corpus Christi, the other in San Antonio. Because of her touring schedule, she was unable to run the businesses and decided to appoint Sald√≠var as manager, since Quintanilla, Jr. believed she was the perfect choice, having successfully filled the role as president of the fan club for three years. The singer began receiving complaints from employees, her fashion designer, and her cousin about Sald√≠var's management skills. They claimed that Sald√≠var mismanaged Selena's affairs, manipulated their decisions, destroyed their creations, intimidated and threatened them, and secretly recorded them without their consent or knowledge. Selena did not believe Sald√≠var, now a close friend, would impose on her fashion business. Quintanilla, Jr. began receiving complaints after the initial attempts to have Sald√≠var fired from her job failed. He tried convincing Selena that Sald√≠var might be a bad influence on her. She brushed aside the comments since her father always mistrusted people. In January 1995, Quintanilla, Jr. began receiving letters and phone calls from angry fans who had sent their enrollment fees for the fan club and received nothing. He began an investigation and found that Sald√≠var had used forged checks to embezzle $30,000 from both the fan club and the boutiques. On March 9, 1995, the Quintanilla family held a meeting to discuss the disappearing funds. Sald√≠var's answers to Quintanilla, Jr.'s questions were not convincing, and he informed her that if she could not disprove his accusations that he would get the police involved.  Selena's murder  The day after being confronted by the Quintanilla family, Sald√≠var was banned from contacting Selena. Sald√≠var purchased a .38 Special revolver but lied to the clerk about her intentions claiming she was a nurse whose patients' relatives had threatened her life. Sald√≠var convinced Selena to meet her alone at her Days Inn motel room on March 31, 1995. In the motel room, Selena demanded financial papers required for tax preparation. Sald√≠var delayed handing over the papers claiming that she had been raped during a recent Mexico trip. Selena drove Sald√≠var to Doctors Regional Hospital but doctors found no evidence of rape.\\"12 October 1995 testimony of Carla Anthony\\". Houston Chronicle, October 12, 1995. Retrieved May 21, 2008. When they returned to the motel room, Selena emptied Sald√≠var's satchel which was filled with documents relating to the boutiques and fan club as well as the .38 revolver. Sald√≠var grabbed the gun and pointed it at Selena. As Selena attempted to flee, Sald√≠var shot her in the back, severing an artery. Critically wounded, Selena ran to the motel's lobby and collapsed on the floor, naming Sald√≠var as her assailant, and giving the room number where she had been shot.\\"Friday, 13 October, testimony of Shawna Vela\\". Houston Chronicle, October 13, 1995. Retrieved February 1, 2008. Her condition began to deteriorate rapidly as motel staff attended to her.

Retrieved February 1, 2008.  Sald√≠var's arrest  After the shooting, Sald√≠var got into her pickup truck and attempted to leave the motel. Rosario Garza, a motel staff member, saw Sald√≠var leave her room with a wrapped towel. It was later thought that she had been on her way to Q-Productions to shoot Quintanilla, Jr., and others waiting for Selena to arrive for a planned recording session. However, she was spotted by a responding police officer. An officer emerged from the cruiser, drew his gun, and ordered Sald√≠var to get out of the truck. Sald√≠var did not comply. Instead, she backed up and parked adjacent to two cars; her truck was then blocked by the police cruiser. Sald√≠var picked up the pistol, pointed it at her right temple, and threatened to commit suicide. A SWAT team, and the FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit, were brought in. Musicologist Himilce Novas commented that the event was reminiscent of O. J. Simpson's threatened suicide ten months earlier. Larry Young and Isaac Valencia began negotiating with Sald√≠var. They ran a phone line to their base of operations, adjacent to Sald√≠var's pickup truck, as the standoff continued. Motel guests were ordered to remain in their rooms until police could escort them out. Sald√≠var surrendered after nearly nine-and-a-half hours. By that time, hundreds of fans had gathered at the scene; many wept as police took Sald√≠var away. Within hours of Selena's murder, a press conference was held. Assistant Police Chief Ken Bung and Quintanilla, Jr., informed the press that a possible motive was that Selena had gone to the Days Inn motel to terminate \\"her\\" employment; Sald√≠var was still not identified by name in media reports. Rudy Trevi√±o, director of the Texas Talent Music Association, and sponsor of the Tejano Music Awards, declared that March 31, 1995, would be known as \\"Black Friday\\".  Trial   Pre-trial  On April 3, Sald√≠var was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to Selena's murder. Her bail was set at $100,000 though it was raised to $500,000 at the behest of district attorney Carlos Valdez who considered Sald√≠var to be a flight risk. When bail was announced, people asked why the death penalty had not been sought. The Nueces County jail was deluged with death threats and there were public calls for vigilante justice. Some gang members in Texas were reported to have taken up collections to raise the bond for Sald√≠var so they could kill her when she was released. Veteran CCPD detective Paul Rivera led the murder investigation. Originally, an unnamed man was hired to defend Sald√≠var but withdrew from the case on April 4 fearing community retaliation, and concerned about his children's reaction when they learned he was defending Sald√≠var whom they disliked. Judge Mike Westergren began searching for a defense attorney. Prosecutor Carlos Valdez was designated lead prosecutor, while Mark Skurka was appointed his legal counsel. On April 6, a grand jury was called to determine whether to indict Sald√≠var for murder. After about an hour, the jury had returned a true bill and the indictment was randomly assigned to the 214th District Court. Carlos Valdez believed that a speedy trial with Westergren presiding over the case was probable. Douglas Tinker, a 30-year veteran attorney, was assigned to defend Sald√≠var. Tinker was called one of the best criminal defense lawyers in the state of Texas, and was estimated by Richard Haynes, also a Texas criminal defense attorney, to be worth $50 million. His wife, fearful that they would suffer from community retribution, asked Tinker not to take the case. Arnold Garcia, a former district prosecutor, was chosen by Tinker as his co-counsel. The judge honored Tinker's request for a private investigator. The court date was originally set for August 17, but, for unknown reasons, was pushed back two months to October 9. On May 18, Tinker and Valdez argued about the possibility of reducing Sald√≠var's bond to $10,000. Tinker argued that she should not be in prison since she had not yet been found guilty of murder and deserved to be out on bail. Valdez argued that Sald√≠var was a flight risk, with contacts in Mexico, and, were she to be released from prison, it was unlikely she would be seen again. Sald√≠var's parents, siblings, and former co- workers argued that she had no financial resources to make bond, and that she was incapable of the actions of which she was accused. Valdez called Rivera to the stand. He claimed that Sald√≠var had developed several foreign contacts as a result of working for Selena. Rivera also brought up the ongoing investigation of the embezzlement claims, stating that Sald√≠var might have access to funds that the investigation had not yet uncovered. Westergren denied the bond reduction, and Sald√≠var was returned to jail. After the May 18 ruling, Westergren decided to move the case to Houston, Texas. His decision was based upon the demographics of predominantly Hispanic Nueces County, citing a preponderance of people who viewed Selena as a \\"well known and beloved member of the Hispanic population.\\" During the time of trial, Houston was predominately White. On August 4, the pretrial hearing began as Tinker filed three motions; a change of venue to Houston (which was pre-approved), a motion to suppress or exclude Sald√≠var's written statement, and a motion to suppress or exclude Sald√≠var's oral statements made at the time of her arrest. Tinker presented twelve witnesses: a former district judge, a former district attorney, a former first assistant district attorney, several private lawyers, and members of the media. They all expressed concern that Sald√≠var could not have an impartial jury because of the overwhelming media coverage. A Spanish- language radio personality informed the judge that the general consensus among Hispanics in the area was that Sald√≠var was guilty and that she would be acquitted because of the \\"faulty\\" juridical system, and Valdez's lack of experience. The judge recessed the hearing and Valdez scrambled to find witnesses who believed that an unbiased jury could be selected were the trial to be held in Corpus Christi. The hearing resumed on August 7, and Valdez presented five witnesses who believed that Sald√≠var could have a fair trial despite the media coverage. The following day, Westergren granted the motion to change the venue to Houston, Texas.  Trial in Houston  = First week of trial = The selection of jury members was completed on October 9. The jury included seven white Americans, four Hispanics, and one African American. Westergren ordered that the trial would neither be televised nor taped and limited the number of reporters in the courtroom to avoid a \\"repeat of the Simpson circus\\". The trial began on October 11. In his opening statement, Valdez claimed that Sald√≠var \\"deliberately killed Selena\\", calling the act \\"senseless and cowardly\\" because Selena had been shot in the back. Valdez called the incident a \\"simple case of murder\\". Tinker opened his statement as though he was \\"describing a mystery movie\\" calling Quintanilla, Jr. a \\"controlling and dominating father, ambitious for power and money.\\" His removal of Selena from school to sing in nightclubs and bars served \\"the sole purpose of making money.\\" He infringed on his family's privacy by demanding that they live in a compound so that he could watch their every move. Tinker asserted that Selena wanted to be independent and \\"break from her father's control\\" by operating her own business. According to Tinker, after Sald√≠var fired the gun, she \\"ran after her friend to help her\\" by getting her into her pickup truck. He claimed that Quintanilla, Jr. called Sald√≠var a \\"lesbian obsessed\\" with Selena. Tinker ended his opening statement saying that Quintanilla, Jr. drove Sald√≠var \\"to near madness\\" by threatening to destroy her friendship with Selena. The prosecutor's first witness was Quintanilla, Jr. Valdez asked if he had had sexual relations with, or raped, Sald√≠var. He also asked him if he ever called Sald√≠var a lesbian. Quintanilla, Jr. said \\"no.\\" Valdez then asking him about the alleged theft. Quintanilla, Jr. told the court that Sald√≠var was a thief. Valdez then called Chris P√©rez, Selena's widower, who testified that he and Selena had stopped trusting Sald√≠var long before the crime was committed. Kyle Voss and Mike McDonald from A Place to Shoot, the store where Sald√≠var had purchased the gun, testified that they had instructed her on the proper use of the gun. They also said that she had returned the gun two days after originally purchasing it claiming that her father had given her a pistol. She returned eleven days later to repurchase the gun. On October 12, Valdez called Trinidad Espinoza to the stand. He testified that he saw Sald√≠var pointing a gun while running after Selena. Sald√≠var then stopped, lowered the gun, and walked back into her motel room displaying no emotion. After hearing this testimony, Marcella Quintanilla (Selena's mother) experienced chest and arm pains and was hospitalized to treat a sudden rise in her blood pressure. Motel maid Norma Marie Martinez also described the same events as Espinoza, but added that Sald√≠var had called Selena a \\"bitch\\". Tinker asked Martinez to indicate where she had been on a diagram of the scene of the crime. He believed that Martinez could not have seen or heard anything because she was a considerable distance from the vicinity of the shooting. Emergency room personnel, who attended to Sald√≠var when Selena drove her to the hospital to be checked for rape, claimed that Sald√≠var had lied to Selena about the rape as there were inconsistencies between the story she told them and the one she told Selena. Tinker asked the nurse to describe Sald√≠var's mood at that time. She replied that the Sald√≠var showed symptoms of depression. Tinker asked if those symptoms were typically found in a victim of sexual assault. The nurse agreed they were. Another nurse who attended to Sald√≠var stated that she had red welts on her neck and arms, but that they did not resemble the bruises a person would receive from an assault by a baseball bat as Sald√≠var claimed. The prosecutor showed the jury the outfit Sald√≠var had worn during her alleged rape. He claimed that someone had purposefully torn holes and shredded the shirt with scissors. On October 13, Rosalinda Gonzalez, the assistant manager of the Days Inn, was called to testify. She told the jury that when Selena arrived in the lobby after being shot, she had asked the singer who shot her. Selena cried out \\"the girl in room 158\\". Ruben DeLeon, the motel's salesman, said that Selena told him \\"Yolanda, Yolanda Sald√≠var shot me. The one in room 158.\\" Receptionist Shawna Vela testified that she had heard the same statements but added that Selena had screamed: \\"lock the door, she'll shoot me again\\" before collapsing. Vela told the jury that there was so much blood that she felt nauseous before calling 911. The last person to be called to testify was paramedic Richard Fredrickson who described, in detail, Selena's condition and a mysterious ring she clutched in her hands. The Quintanilla family were seen sobbing as Fredrickson detailed his attempts to save Selena's life, while Sald√≠var \\"stared blankly\\". = Second Week of Trial = The trial resumed on Monday, October 16 with the playing of the recorded negotiations between the FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit and Sald√≠var. The tape began with Sald√≠var stating how badly she wanted to die. During the conversation, the jury heard Larry Young try to persuade her to lower her gun; Sald√≠var said that she could not do so. Young told her that by committing suicide she would only harm her parents. Sald√≠var then asked to contact her mother to say goodbye and ask for forgiveness. She continued repeating, \\"I just wanna die\\" as Young began talking about religion to determine if she believed in a faith that might cause her to reconsider suicide. Young told Sald√≠var that if she would give herself up, he would place a jacket over her so that the media would not have a picture of her face during her surrender. Isaac Valencia told Sald√≠var that if she were to surrender they promised to turn off all of the lights that were pointing towards her truck; she agreed. As she left her truck, she was scared by the dozens of armed police and FBI agents who were pointing rifles and pistols at her. She ran back to her truck, pointed the gun at her head, and screamed at Young: \\"They're carrying guns! They're carrying guns! They're going to kill me! They're going to kill me!\\" Newswoman Mar√≠a Celeste Arrar√°s wrote in her 1997 investigative book that she found it \\"curious\\" that a person who cried for hours that she wanted to die \\"would be afraid that someone might make her wish come true.\\" The New York Times also commented that \\"she alternately begged to be killed and expressed fear that she would be killed if she left the truck.\\" As the taped conversation continued, the jury heard Sald√≠var's reaction to the news of Selena's death after her phone picked up a local radio station's signal. In an angry voice, Sald√≠var asked Young why he had kept the singer's condition from her, since she wanted to visit Selena at the hospital, believing she was still alive. Young told Sald√≠var not to believe the radio announcement, and that he did not know about Selena's current condition. The conversation then switched to Sald√≠var blaming Quintanilla, Jr. for the murder, claiming that he threatened to kill her. She explained to Young that she bought the gun for protection after finding her car tires deliberately slashed. She also told him how Quintanilla, Jr. sexually abused her by \\"sticking a knife\\" in her vagina, threatening to murder her if she went to the police. When asked about what happened in her motel room, Sald√≠var exclaimed: \\"I bought this gun to kill myself, not her, and she told me, 'Yolanda, I don't want you to kill yourself.' And we were talking about that when I took it out and pointed it to my head, and when I pointed it to my head, she opened the door. I said 'Selena, close that door,' and when I did that gun went off.\\" The prosecution then told the jury that comments by some officers had planted the idea in Sald√≠var's head that the shooting was accidental. The defense countered stating that although she did not use the word \\"accident\\", she did not mean to harm Selena. John Houston, a police officer who was present during the standoff, was asked during the nine and a half hours that Sald√≠var held the gun to her head, how many times it \\"went off\\"; he said \\"none\\". The trial resumed on October 18. Robert Garza, a Texas Ranger, told the jury that during the preliminary hearings in Corpus Christi, he witnessed Sald√≠var making gestures indicating that the shooting had been accidental, though she had not indicated this in her confession. The defense called Rivera to the stand and explained to the jury that Rivera had a conflict of interest after finding out that he had a poster of Selena hanging on his wall and was treated to a Selena T-shirt by Quintanilla, Jr. Tinker explained to the jury that the confession was signed by an exhausted, sleep deprived Sald√≠var after eleven hours of questioning and being denied water, food, and use of a bathroom. Tinker asked Rivera why he destroyed his notes, and why he had not recorded his interrogation of Sald√≠var, had not provided her with a lawyer as the law requires, and had not allowed her to see her relatives after signing her confession. A few days later, the Mexican Mafia sent Tinker a signed postcard declaring their intention to harm him and his family for defending Sald√≠var. On October 19, the defense called the two surgeons who tried to revive Selena at the hospital. The defense questioned why Quintanilla, Jr. would request that a blood transfusion not to be performed on Selena due to his religious beliefs, when by law, P√©rez would have the final say whether or not the procedure would be performed. The autopsy pictures of Selena were displayed for everyone to see. The white American jury member was affected by the pictures, and was seen \\"bursting into tears\\" as Lloyd White described his findings in detail. According to Arrar√°s, Sald√≠var was seen as \\"impassive\\"; she had \\"lowered her head\\" when the autopsy pictures were shown. After confirming that Selena was not pregnant, contradicting rumors in media reports, White announced his conclusion: \\"this was a homicide, not an accident.\\" The prosecution called on a firearms expert who found the gun to be in working condition and stating that a person pulling the trigger must use a \\"great amount of pressure\\". Valdez showed pictures of the motel room where Selena had been shot, claiming, \\"It was impossible for [Sald√≠var] not know her friend had been wounded,\\" and \\"this meant that she had not come to [Selena's] aid because she chose not to.\\" The defense arguments began on October 20 with Barbra Schultz, the hotel's general manager, taking the stand. Tinker asked if Selena had actually screamed out to them to lock the doors. She replied that Selena had never asked for the doors to be locked and was only moaning on the floor. Schultz further stated that her former employee, Vela, was not trustworthy. Schultz also said that all the employees began formulating different opinions on what happened on March 31 when the prosecution called on them to testify. Staff maid Gloria Maga√±a doubted the validity of Espinoza and Martinez's accounts. She told the jury that it was impossible for both employees to have seen Sald√≠var chasing Selena because their work was on the other side of the motel building. Maga√±a claimed to have seen Selena running through the parking lot, but did not see Sald√≠var chasing after her. Tinker called Marilyn Greer, Selena's seventh grade teacher, to the stand. She told the jury that Selena had had the ability to graduate with honors and could have easily obtained a college scholarship. Greer then spoke about how Quintanilla, Jr. had taken away the possibility of college for Selena, wasting her youth by forcing her to sing at nightclubs and bars for money; something that was unhealthy for a thirteen-year-old girl. = Third week of trial = On October 23, the defense presented their closing arguments, claiming that the shooting was an accident and that Rivera was \\"not interested in pursuing justice. He wanted to make a case.\\" They also argued that Rivera knew hours beforehand that the Sald√≠var case was \\"a big case\\" and had \\"wanted to be the one to get [her].\\" The defense claimed that Selena still referred to Sald√≠var as her \\"dearest friend\\" pointing out that the singer took her to the hospital, despite having a recording session scheduled that day. They reminded the jury that an employee demonstrated that the gun can \\"fire off\\" with \\"just one's little finger.\\" The defense accused the prosecution of manipulating the jury's emotions by displaying photographs of Selena at the morgue, and the trail of blood from the motel room to the lobby. They concluded by telling the jury to not side with a \\"rabid father\\". In the prosecution's closing statement, Skurka told the jury that Selena \\"had been reduced to a mere picture thanks to the March 31 actions of the defendant.\\" Skurka asked the jury why Sald√≠var, a nurse, did not administer first aid and why had she had not called 911 after accidentally shooting the singer in the back. Skurka then provided details of the three different stories Sald√≠var used to explain the purchase of the gun, as well as the different stories about her alleged rape. The prosecutor pointed out that if Sald√≠var had wanted to commit suicide she had ample time to do so. Valdez took out a calendar for the month of March 1995 and chronologically pointed out the events preceding the killing of Selena. According to Valdez, Sald√≠var hated Quintanilla, Jr. and believed that she got revenge by killing his daughter, \\"someone he loved the most.\\"  Verdict and reactions  Sald√≠var's crime was punishable by up to 99 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Sald√≠var was kept at Nueces County jail under a suicide watch before her trial. After closing arguments, the jury deliberated for two hours and twenty-three minutes. As people were waiting for the verdict, prosecutors and the defense team signed autographs for the media as did Sald√≠var. Sald√≠var's family also signed autographs, while Quintanilla, Jr. remained in his seat awaiting the verdict. The jury found Sald√≠var guilty of first-degree murder. She received the maximum sentence of life in prison with parole eligibility in 30 years.Selena's killer receives life sentence of prison. CNN, October 26, 1995. Retrieved September 26, 2010 Before the verdict was read, some in the crowd and Quintanilla, Jr. were skeptical of the outcome of the trial after O. J. Simpson's acquittal a week earlier. Sald√≠var told her defense team that she wanted to kill herself after the verdict was read. The Hispanic population cheered as Westergren delivered the verdict and Sald√≠var's sentence. Celebrations and festivals were planned throughout the states of Texas and California and in some areas in Mexico. Fans outside the courtroom began playing Selena's music and cheered for hours. Some fans were seen cheering in Sald√≠var's face as police officers drove her off to prison. Other fans prayed and cried out that justice had been served. Traffic in Texas was reportedly at a standstill as people took to the streets and highways in cheering the verdict. Sald√≠var's parents were greeted by fans wearing T-shirts degrading her and screams from fans who told them \\"now let's kill the murderer!\\" and \\"hang the witch\\". The verdict was front-page news in dozens of newspapers across the United States.  Media coverage and aftermath  Arrar√°s referred to this case as the \\"O. J. Simpson trial for Hispanics.\\" It was the most watched trial in years in the state of Texas. The Brownsville Herald called the case: \\"the biggest courthouse media event to hit Houston.\\" According to Texas Monthly, there were more than two-hundred media personnel stationed at the courthouse. Univision and Telemundo aired approximately ninety minutes' worth of coverage daily. Arrar√°s was called \\"the trial's undisputed media star\\" for her coverage of the trial and her Primer Impacto program had the \\"most knowledgeable courtroom analyst\\" in former state district judge Jorge Rangel, who provided his expertise on the law. During the playing of the recorded conversation between Sald√≠var and Young in the courtroom, Sald√≠var called out \\"Where's Larry?\\", a mantra that was put on T-shirts sold to the crowds. The Chicago Tribune noted the difference in interest in the Selena murder trial between Hispanics and white Americans. Donna Dickerson, a white American magazine publisher, told the Chicago Tribune that she had no interest in the trial because of Selena's \\"Hispanic background\\" and noted that Mexican Americans did not show the same interest as whites when Elvis Presley was found dead. The Selena murder trial was called the \\"trial of the century\\" and the most important trial to the Hispanic population. The trial generated interest in Spain, Europe, South America, Australia and Japan. Tinker announced an appeal before signing autographs for the cheering crowds. On December 22, the Houston Chronicle reported that Sald√≠var's lawyers were seeking a retrial, citing the prosecution's failure to notify them that a key witness had once been convicted of theft. Maria Norma Martinez, a motel maid, was said to be the only one to have seen the shooting. She claimed to have heard Sald√≠var call Selena a bitch. The prosecution had used the remark to discredit the defense's claim that the shooting was accidental. Westergren denied the request and called the prosecutors' action \\"somewhat problematic,\\" but decided an appeals court should decide on a retrial.\\" Both requests for an appeal were denied on October 3, 1998 and on August 19, 1999. On November 22, 1995, Sald√≠var arrived at the Gatesville Unit (now the Christina Crain Unit) in Gatesville, Texas, for processing.Bennett, David. \\"Somber Sald√≠var delivered to prison ‚Äì Convicted murderer of Tejano star Selena keeps head down during processing.\\" San Antonio Express-News. November 23, 1995. Retrieved September 26, 2010. Sald√≠var is currently serving her sentence at the Mountain View Unit in Gatesville, operated by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. She will be eligible for parole on March 30, 2025.\\"Offender Information Detail Sald√≠var, Yolanda .\\" Texas Department of Criminal Justice. October 26, 1995. Retrieved December 30, 2010. Enter the SID \\"05422564.\\" Because of multiple death threats from incarcerated Selena fans, Sald√≠var was placed in isolation and spends twenty-three hours a day alone in her cell, away from other inmates who may want to do her harm. Sald√≠var has asked the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals to accept a petition that challenges her conviction. She claims the petition was filed in 2000 with the 214th District Court, but was never sent to the higher court. Her request was received on March 31, 2008, the thirteenth anniversary of Selena's death. Tinker and Garcia told a Texas Monthly magazine editor that losing the trial lessens their chances of getting shot by a fan. Hispanics in Texas had an increased level of trust in the state's judicial system after the verdict was read. The League of United Latin American Citizens began a campaign that encouraged Hispanics to respond to jury duty requests. E! dramatized the trial as part of an episode of E! True Hollywood Story in December 1996. People magazine called it \\"too cheap-looking to have any dramatic impact,\\" but found the actor playing Tinker \\"interesting\\". By virtue of a judge's order, the gun used to kill Selena was destroyed in 2002, and the pieces thrown into Corpus Christi Bay.National Briefing Southwest: Texas: Gun That Killed Singer Is To Be Destroyed The New York Times, June 8, 2002. Retrieved on July 16, 2006. However, fans and historians did not approve of the decision, claiming that the event was historical and that the gun should have been placed in a museum. In 1997, Arrar√°s published her book Selena's Secret, which included interviews with Sald√≠var recounting the singer's \\"real life\\" and her side of the events of March 31. The book met with negative reviews from fans as well as Quintanilla, Jr. who claimed Arrar√°s sympathized with the convicted killer. Valdez also published a book on the trial, Justice for Selena: The State vs. Yolanda Saldivar, in 2004. In December 2014, the San Antonio Express-News reported that Sald√≠var was \\"mounting a new legal effort to get an early release from prison, following numerous appeals in her case.\\" The news of Sald√≠var's potential early release by a fake news agency which reported that Sald√≠var could be released as early as January 1, 2015 sparked a social media frenzy among fans. Valdez told the San Antonio Express-News that Sald√≠var is currently representing herself and that a court date has not yet been set. Sald√≠var claims that witnesses were not called on and files have gone missing since the end of the trial. Quintanilla, Jr. said that he \\"doesn't care\\" if Sald√≠var gets an early release, since \\"nothing is going to bring [his] daughter back.\\" He does say that Sald√≠var would be safer in prison rather than being freed.

She had one older sister, Piedad Ch√°vez Sandoval (1888‚Äì1969). The sisters spent part of their childhood at the Salvador Armijo House in Old Town, which was built in the 1840s by their maternal great-grandfather, Salvador Armijo.

In Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia, Peltogyne purpurea has been declared a vulnerable species. Peltogyne purpurea was included in the Red Book of Plants of Colombia: Endangered Timber Species, under the IUCN designation of Vulnerable (VU). Wood Purpleheart wood Purpleheart wood is heavy (0.8-1 g/cm3) with a medium to fine texture. The sapwood is gray-yellow, whereas the heartwood is bright purple with dark stripes. The wood is difficult to work with, dry, and preserve, but has a high natural durability. Purpleheart wood is popular for manufacturing floors, furniture, structural elements, and architectural finishes due to its physical and mechanical properties. Purpleheart wood is moderately difficult to work with hand or machine tools. Slow feed rates and hardened cutters are suggested, because purpleheart exudes a gummy resin when heated by dull tools. The wood turns smoothly, is easy to glue and takes finishes well. Cultivation There is little information about cultivation, because Peltogyne purpurea is not commercially cultivated. Its fruits can be collected directly from the tree, or from the soil once fruits have fallen. To remove the seeds, fruits must to be exposed to sunlight for 3‚Äì4 hours for one or two days. Seeds can be stored 2 to 3 years with regulated conditions of 5 ¬∞C and 6-8 % humidity. A kilogram of seeds has between 2200 and 2500 seeds. In a plant nursery, seeds can be planted in disinfected sand seedbeds. Once plants reach 8‚Äì10 cm (normally 4 weeks after germination), plants are ready to be transplanted to the pots, bags or boxes. A plant will be ready to be planted in the field once it reaches 23 cm. Peltogyne purpurea is a recognizable, coveted and highly exploited species; however, it is poorly studied and the only research that has been undertaken is in Costa Rica. Uses In Costa Rica and Panama, Purpleheart wood is an economically valuable tree, however its harvest is prohibited by law. The wood is commonly used for general carpentry, interior and exterior decoration, furniture, cabinet work, flooring, marquetry, stairways, wooden boat building & restoration, and luxury coffins.

Astronomy, science, and nature have played a significant role in Mooney's art, and his public sculptures often draw inspiration from the spirit of place, the importance of the site, its history, and present environment.  Biography  A Champaign native, Mooney received his MFA from University of Illinois at Urbana. In 1994, Mooney was an artist-in-residence at the Vatican Observatory at Castel Gandolfo and created outdoor sculptures inspired by astronomical phenomena at the Observatory's rooftop telescopes and Vatican gardens. His 48-story light sculpture became the icon for the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, and his Malta Millennium sculpture, commissioned by the government of Malta, ushered in 2000. Other important projects include Light Muse, the transformation of the Tribune Tower into a light sculpture to celebrate the Chicago Tribunes sesquicentennial in 1997, and Lightscape '89, a display projected on the IBM Building in Chicago in honor of the company's 75th anniversary. In North America, Mooney's commissions include Crystara, a 30-foot-long Waterford Crystal and aluminum suspended sculpture created for the John Crerar Library at the University of Chicago; the Miami Wave, a 57,000 sq. ft. paving piece designed for a new entrance to the Miami International Airport; Wild Ricing Moon, a 95-foot-high sculpture honoring the Native Americans for the University of Minnesota Duluth; and Spiral Galaxy, a 16' high stainless steel sculpture located on the grounds in front of the Adler Planetarium in Chicago. The artist's Art in the Park project for Urbana, Illinois, was completed in the spring of 2012 with the installation of Spirit Tree, a 33-foot-high light sculpture. Mooney designed all of the park's components: Falling Leaf, the park's 12-foot-high mirrored polished stainless steel fountain sculpture; the landscaping and plant material; the paving; the furniture; and the lighting. The artist's work is in numerous private and public collections, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, The Art Institute of Chicago, and major museums in Europe. Mooney has had a distinguished academic career, having taught at numerous institutions throughout the United States and Europe. He was named a Distinguished Professor and Critic at the University of North Carolina's College of Architecture and a Distinguished Professor and Scholar in the Fine Arts at the University of Southern Indiana. In Europe, he has taught at such institutions as the National College of Art and Design in Dublin, the Glasgow School of Art in Glasgow, and the Royal College of Art's Graduate School of Art in London. In 2016 he signed the pptArt Manifesto, an international art movement that today promotes many notable initiatives like the Corporate Art Awards. He is founder and artistic director of the John David Mooney Foundation, which since 1981, has offered international artists and architects a place to study their postgraduate, advance disciplines and transform the public domain through art. Awards Mooney has received honorary doctorates from Purdue University, Dominican University, and Lyon College. He has been the recipient of more than eight fellowships including the National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship, the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts Fellowship, the Royal Society of the Arts Fellowship, and four fellowships from the MacDowell Colony. Among his many honors, Mooney received the Eloise G. ReQua International Humanitarian Award in 1999 awarded by the Chicago-Kent School of Law at the Illinois Institute of Technology. In 2006, Mooney awarded the Chicago Illini of the Year from his alma mater.

B. Harrison (14 July 1894 ‚Äì 1 November 1991) was one of the leading Shakespeare experts of his time and the editor of the Shakespeare Penguin Classics. During his professional career, Harrison was an English professor at both Queen's University and the University of Michigan. He was a firm believer in traditional Catholicism and was a member of the Advisory Committee of the International Commission of English in the Liturgy. The Advisory Committee was in charge of overseeing and organizing work on a modern English translation of the Latin Mass. In his lifetime, Harrison had an active part in both World Wars and lived a civilian's life in four countries. Early life and education G. B. Harrison was born George Bagshawe Harrison on 14 July 1894 in Hove, Sussex, England. He was christened after his grandfather on his father's side, and the middle name of Bagshawe was derived from his mother's side of the family. Although both of his parents envisioned high aspirations to fit a namesake that joined both sides of the family, an older Harrison wrote in his memoir that he \\"would have none of it.\\" His father, Walter Harrison, had a master's degree in dentistry from Harvard and married Ada Louise Bagshawe. G. B. Harrison was the second oldest. He succeeded Walter Parker, and was followed by Richard. Harrison grew up being read to and soon he and Walter were demanding their favorite stories and seeking new ones. His mother took him to a kindergarten for both boys and girls where Harrison slowly expanded his interest in reading until he could read for himself. Walter Harrison Sr. often took the boys to London for royal pageants and parades, popular in their time and giving way to vast crowds in Trafalgar Square. At the age of seven, Harrison continued his early education at the Brighton and Hove Boys' Preparatory School: Crescent House. Harrison furthered his education at Brighton College in order to receive the full \\"public school education.\\" He attended Queens' College, Cambridge from 1913-1914 and again from 1919-1920 and received First Class Honors in English Tripos, as well as a BA degree. In 1923, he earned an MA degree. Later, in 1928, Harrison earned a PhD in London (Harrison's Resume). During and after his college education, Harrison served in both World Wars. For most of World War I, Harrison was based in Lucknow, India as a Second Lieutenant in the 5th Queen's R. W. S. Regiment. He noted that his regiment consisted of the only white troops in the garrison. Harrison wrote his parents nearly every day and noted the everyday aspects of life from training exercises and drills, to pickup sports matches, to sightseeing excursions. He kept careful track of whether or not he received mail in reply and often reminded his parents that their letter writing frequency was not quite up to par. The Christmas package that they sent, was, Harrison feared, at the bottom of the ocean, along with the ship that had been carrying it. Later on, Harrison was stationed in Mesopotamia (G. B. Harrison letters to parents). In World War II, Harrison became a Supplies Officer and later worked in Intelligence. Family and personal life On 9 April 1919 Harrison married his wife, Dorothy. Together, the two had four children: Maurice, Joan, Michael and Anthony. Starting in 1910, Harrison kept up a frequent diary. He recorded everyday events and profound thoughts, and on December 31 of each year, he summed up the highs and lows and evaluated that particular year of his life as it related to all the others. At first, Harrison recorded these thoughts in marbled composition books, but later on he favored the Canadian Line Daily journal. When he moved to Michigan, Harrison replaced it with the similarly arrayed Collins Royal Diary (Harrison Diaries). Teaching career Harrison started his career in 1924 as a reader at King's College London and held this position until his work was interrupted by the Second World War. In the event of war, Cambridge planned a scheme of dispersal for the various schools and colleges. When this scheme took effect in the year 1939, Harrison was not invited to accompany the college in exile. He applied to a vast number of places for work and this number included \\"all the universities in Canada\\" In May 1943, Harrison was informed of his appointment as head of the English Department at Queen's University in Ontario. Thus the family crossed the Atlantic Ocean and moved to Canada (Harrison's Memoir). His daughter attended Queen's Medical School and Harrison grew accustomed to his position as a member of the faculty (Letters to Rice). Like most people, Harrison was tempted by a higher salary and a change of pace. He was offered a professorship at the University of Michigan, but before Harrison would accept, he sent several lines of inquiry to his future colleagues at Michigan. Harrison did not want to feel as if he was jumping ship on Queen's and its faculty and students who had never caused him grief or driven him to conflict (Letters to Rice). Despite all of this, Harrison was also looking to expand his horizons. He was very concerned about budgeting and being able to pursue his own lines of interest. Harrison did not want to be tied down by University guidelines or teaching policy, and although Michigan offered him a better salary, Harrison also wanted to make sure that everything from the pension to the available housing in Ann Arbor aligned with his goals (Letters to Rice). There was also the matter of obtaining a Visa. To express these worries and various others, Harrison sent a flurry of letters to the Dean and various other members of the University of Michigan English Department. Harrison formally accepted his appointment to Michigan on 25 July 1948. After rounding out the first half of 1949 at Queen's, Harrison and Dorothy set out for Ann Arbor. Harrison officially took up post at the University of Michigan in the fall term of 1949 (Letters to Rice). At the University of Michigan, Harrison became professor of Shakespearean and Elizabethan studies. He received various honorary degrees for his work and continued to teach until his retirement from Michigan. Harrison was reappointed almost immediately as a professor working on 1/3rd time for the winter term of January 1965. After this term, Harrison celebrated his official retirement, which happened to coincide with the 400th anniversary year of Shakespeare (News and Information). After retirement, Harrison worked on translating the Catholic Latin Mass into English and took part in the International Commission on English in the Liturgy. Published and edited works What is perhaps Harrison's most well-known contribution to literary circles, although not many people are aware of his direct contribution, are the Shakespeare Penguin Classics, for which he was general editor. These relatively cheap, paperback copies were \\"intended for serious readers of books who preferred owning their own cop[ies].\\" Harrison also edited the Harcourt Brace College Shakespeare. Harrison is also known for his many works on Shakespeare and his fictional Elizabethan and Jacobean Journals. During his own studies, Harrison noticed that while there were notable books that centered on and analyzed Shakespeare, there was \\"nothing cheap, popular and portable.\\" This led to Shakespeare: The Man and his Stage in 1923, which was written in collaboration with E. A. G. Lamborn. The book centered on Shakespeare, his plays, and the traditions of the time they were written in. In reviews, it was held up as successfully providing valuable academic content in simple, engaging and easy to understand language. Harrison found a way to convey historic events in a creative and engaging way in his Elizabethan Journals which included An Elizabethan Journal: Being a Record of Those Things Most Talked of During the Years 1591-1594, A Second Elizabethan Journal and A Last Elizabethan Journal. In his Jacobean Journals, Harrison proves adept at writing in and simulating seventeenth century style prose. As in the Elizabethan Journals, Harrison searches through primary historical evidence and weaves it into an engaging narrative in the form of multiple journals published under the titles: A Jacobean Journal: Being a Record of Those Things Most Talked of During the Years 1603-1606, and A Second Jacobean Journal: 1607-1610. Other notable works include biographies centered on John Bunyan and the Earl of Essex (G. B. Harrison Papers, Biography). In 1962, Harrison published The Profession of English. It was to fill the role of a textbook of sorts, and, according to an education orientated reviewer, succeeded as a worthy \\"pedagogical autobiography.\\" Instead of solely focusing on just the professor, the book also questions and encourages what students think. Harrison's original goal, as he states in the introduction, was to answer a question that his graduate assistant had earnestly asked as the pair were walking through Angell Hall at the University of Michigan. His graduate assistant boldly inquired after what Harrison was \\"trying to accomplish in [his] teaching and study of English literature.\\" After pursuing various lines of inquiry with professors in all areas of the department, Harrison realized that no one had a ready and genuine answer to his graduate assistant's question. Not even Harrison himself had been able to answer without circling around the heart of the matter. Thus, in The Profession of English, Harrison sets out to answer this question and explore the broader implications of reading and studying English. While G. B. Harrison was interested in and did write fiction, he ultimately ended up only publishing one novel. The Fires of Arcadia was published in 1956. It follows the life of a young lad and describes the various adventures that pepper his college experience. Later, in 1985, Harrison published his memoir, One Man in His Time. He explores all aspects of and tries to make sense of his life in regards to the snippets of memory that pertain to the ordinary, everyday events of life. Everyone is, in a sense, only a product of the time that he or she lives in. Later years and retirement After a long, successful career, G. B. Harrison and Dorothy retired to New Zealand, and Harrison wrote and published his memoir. George Bagshawe Harrison died at his New Zealand home on 1 November 1991.

This term appeared as a result of research associated with the effective school movement of the 1980s, which revealed that the key to running successful schools lies in the principals' role. However, the concept of instructional leadership is recently stretched out to include more distributed models which emphasize distributed and shared empowerment among school staff, for example distributed leadership, shared leadership, and transformational leadership. History The concept of instructional leadership emerged and developed in the United States within the effective school movement of the 1980s. The research resulting from this movement revealed that a principal is critical to success in children's learning within poor urban elementary schools.Edmonds, R. (1979). Effective schools for the urban poor. Educational Leadership, 37, 15-24.Leithwood, K., & Montgomery, D. (1982). The role of the elementary principal in program improvement. Review of Educational Research, 52(3), 309-339.Hallinger, P. (2009). Leadership for 21st century schools: From instructional leadership to leadership for learning. This research revealed that the personality characteristics of the ideal principal are strong mindedness, directness, top- down management and charisma. During the 1990s, a strong instructional leadership model was still at the center of the educational leadership discussion, because of its effectiveness in the schools. However, since then this concept has been criticized for focusing too much on the individual principal's heroic role. As a result, the scholars started to explore leadership models to supplement these critics and point out the distributed nature of instructional leadership such as transformational leadership, teacher leadership, shared leadership, and distributed leadership, all of which understand educational leadership as broader perspectives practice that includes school communities.Spillane, Halverson, and Diamond (2004) Towards a theory of leadership practice: a distributed perspective. Journal of Curriculum Studies, 36(1), 3-34 Moreover, the accountability movement of the 21st century sheds new light on instructional leadership since this paradigm puts more emphasis on the learning outcomes for students.Halverson, Grigg, Prichett, and Thomas(2006) The new instructional leadership: Creating data- driven instructional systems in schools. Journal of School leadership, January 17 Approaches Researchers have further defined instructional leadership to include different approaches. First, the concept of instructional leadership could be divided into an \\"exclusive\\" and an ‚Äòinclusive‚Äô approach.Robinson, V. M., Lloyd, C. A., & Rowe, K. J. (2008). The impact of leadership on student outcomes: An analysis of the differential effects of leadership types. Educational Administration Quarterly Researchers who count instructional leadership as \\"exclusive\\" regard the principal as the sole holder of responsibility when it comes to setting goals for the school, supervision, and in developing instruction that enhances academic achievement. This perspective tends to focus only on the role of principals as instructional leaders (e.g. Hallinger & Murphy, 1985Hallinger, P., & Murpht, J. (1985). Assessing the instructional leadership behavior of principals. Elementary School Journal, 86(2), 217-248.). However, other researchers have recently expanded the concept of instructional leadership to include not only principals, but also other school staff. They take an \\"inclusive\\" approach to instructional leadership. Especially, Marks and Printy (2003)Marks, H. M., & Printy, S. M. (2003). Principal leadership and school performance: An integration of transformational and instructional leadership. Educational Administration Quarterly, 39(3), 370‚Äì397 have pointed out the importance of the collaboration between principals and teachers to develop curriculum and instruction for improving pupils' performance. Thus, they conceptualized this inclusive approach as ‚Äúshared instructional leadership‚Äù and understood the role of principals as that of ‚Äúleaders of instructional leaders‚Äù. Hallinger (2003)Hallinger, P. (2003). Leading educational change: Reflections on the practice of instructional and transformational leadership. Cambridge Journal of Education, 33(3), 329‚Äì352. has argued the transformational leadership approach, in which leadership is shared with school staff; this approach is said to empower staff. Transformational leadership is a good supplement to the instructional leadership approach that focuses solely on principals and top- down strategies. For this reason, Hallinger has proposed the integration of instructional and transformational leadership approaches. Second, researchers have classified modes of instructional leadership according to \\"direct\\" and \\"indirect\\" activities.Southworth, G. (2002). Instructional leadership in schools: Reflections and empirical evidence. School Leadership & Management, 22(1), 73‚Äì91.Peterson, K.D.(1989). Secondary principals and instructional leadership: Complexities in a diverse role. Madison: Wisconsin Center for Education ResearchKliene-Kracht, P. (1993). Indirect instructional leadership: an administrator‚Äôs choice, Educational Administration Quarterly, 18(4), 1-29Sheppard, B. (1996).Exploring the transformational nature of instructional leadership, The Alberta journal of Educational Research, 42(4), 325-344 The former is considered a \\"narrow\\" mode and the latter a\\"broad\\" mode of instructional leadership. This distinction is due to the fact that a direct perspective focuses only on immediate actions related to instruction, such as classroom observation and curriculum development, whereas an indirect perspective broadly focuses on indirect activities, such as creating the school climate, as well as direct activities. Characteristics Several researchers have outlined the characteristics and components of instructional leadership. Hallinger and Murphy's (1985) conceptual model has been most widely used in empirical studies of instructional leadership. The authors proposed the key role of instructional leaders in three dimensions: 1) Defining the school mission, 2) Managing the instructional program, and 3) Promoting a positive school-learning climate. In these three dimensions, principals have different functions. First, their analyses of a leader's role in defining the school mission focuses on two functions: framing clear school goals and communicating clear school goals. Second, in the area of managing the instructional program, principals have three functions: supervising and evaluating instruction, coordinating curriculum, and monitoring student progress. Third, in regards topromoting a positive school-learning climate principals have five functions: protecting instructional time, promoting professional development, maintaining high visibility, providing incentives for teachers, and providing incentives for learning. Murphy (1988)Murphy, J. (1988). Methodological, measurement, and conceptual problems in the study of instructional leadership. Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, 10(2), 117‚Äì139. proposed four major dimensions of instructional leadership: 1) Developing mission and goals, 2) Managing the education production function, 3) Promoting an academic learning climate, and 4) Developing a supportive work environment. Duke(1982)Duke, D. (1982). Leadership functions and instructional effectiveness. NASSP Bulletin, 66(456), 1‚Äì12. suggested six functions of instructional leadership related to teacher and school effectiveness: 1) Staff development: recruitment, in-service education, and staff motivation, 2) Instructional support: organized activities to maintain an environmentgeared towards improving teaching and learning, 3) Resource acquisition and allocation: adequate learning materials, appropriate facilities, and skilled support personnel 4) Quality control: evaluation, supervision, rewards, and sanctions, 5) Coordination: activities that prevent cross-purposes or duplicate operations, and 6) Troubleshooting: anticipation and resolution of problems in school operation. The first four functions of instructional leadership are directly related to instruction behaviors, whereas the remaining functions are indirectly relevant to instructional activities.

Theory into Practice, 30(2), 97‚Äì101. defined four strategies that instructional leaders use to enhance student achievement: 1) Resource provider: provision of resources to attain learning goals, 2) Instructional resource: provision of strategies and skills to achieve better teaching practice, opportunities for professional development, and assessment for school performance related to instruction, 3) Communicator: promoting discussion among school members about school vision, goals, and culture for successful learning, and 4) Visible presence: showing up through face-to-face interaction as well as through informal exchanges in day-to-day activities. Through extensive literature review, Spillane, Halverson, and Diamond (2004) identified that instructional leaders have several macro-school-level functions. \\"1) constructing and selling an instructional vision, 2) developing and managing a school culture conducive to conversations about the core technology of instruction by building norms of trust, collaboration, and academic press among staff, 3) procuring and distributing resources, including materials, time, support, and compensation, 4) supporting teacher growth and development, both individually and collectively, 5) providing both summative and formative monitoring of instruction and innovation, and 6) establishing a school climate in which disciplinary issues do not dominate instructional issues.\\" Empirical study A study by Hallinger and Heck (1996, 1998)Hallinger, P., & Heck, R. H. (1996). Reassessing the principal‚Äôs role in school effectiveness: A review of empirical research, 1980-1995. Educational Administration Quarterly, 32(1), 5‚Äì44.Hallinger, P., & Heck, R. H. (1998). Exploring the Principal‚Äôs Contribution to School Effectiveness: 1980-1995‚àó. School Effectiveness and School Improvement, 9(2), 157‚Äì191. reviewed extensive empirical research conducted between 1980 and 1995 about the effects of principals on student achievement and identified three models to describe these (1996, p. 16; 1998, p. 162). -A direct-effects model, where principals directly affect student outcomes without mediating variables. -A mediated-effects model, where principals indirectly affect student outcomes through mediating variables (e.g. features of school organization, teachers, and staff) -reciprocal- effects model, where principals and features of the school have an interactive relationship A indirect-effect model With regard to the direct effect of principals on student outcomes, the result showed that the effects were \\"nonexistent, weak, conflicting or suspect in terms of validity\\" (1996, p. 37). It indicates that principals do not directly affect student achievement or, if they do, the effects are quite small. Also, critics point out that this approach does not reveal through what hidden process school leaders impact on student performance. A mediated-effects model In comparison to this findings above, the mediated-effect model was based on more \\"sophisticated theoretical, strong research design, and powerful statistical methods\\" (1996, p. 37). It found that principals significantly impact students' performance through other mediating variables, such as other school staff, events or organizational factors. Reciprocal-effects model In defining the reciprocal-effect model, the authors pointed out that there were no studies to demonstrate this effect yet. However, it is important to note this model because principals not only carry out their leadership role in ways that influence academic achievement, but school outcomes inversely affect principals‚Äô activities as well. Thus, principals and school performance have a reciprocal relationship. Other studies Besides Hallingers and Heck's broad review, several studies conducted in the 1990s and 2000s have also explored the effect of instructional leadership on teacher and student outcome. With respect to the effect of principals on teachers, Shepperd(1996) study in Canadian schools revealed that principals‚Äô instructional leadership activities are positively related to the level of teacher commitment to the school, professional involvement, and innovativeness in the school. Stages in developing instructional leaders Marsh (1992)Marsh, D. D. (1992). Enhancing Instructional Leadership: Lessons from the California School Leadership Academy. Education and Urban Society, 24(3), 386‚Äì409. argued that instructional leaders develop in three stages; 1) Getting started, 2) Doing the pieces of instructional leadership, and 3) Understanding the whole of instructional leadership. In the first stage, principals get to socialize themselves into the role of site administrator and develop routine management skills. However, they do not have real focus on instructional leadership yet. In the second stage, principals could improve their capacity for management. At this stage, principals reflect management and instructional leaderships as an isolated notion, and they still have a fragmented understanding about instructional leadership. In the third stage, principals fully understand the relation between management and instructional leadership. At this stage, they can integrate management and instructional leadership, activities and functions. Finally, they comprehend and reflect instructional leadership as an integrated view. Limitation With the extensive review of empirical studies, Hallinger (2003) pointed out limitations of the concept of instructional leadership and the attentive point of empirical studies. First, the narrowed role of principals, which is confined to developing instructional activities for student performance, does not allow us to fully understand the nature of principals since a principal has various roles when managing a school. Second, strategies of instructional leadership are influenced by the context of schools such as school size, language background, community, and a school's socio-economic status.Heck, R. H. (1992). Principals‚Äô instructional leadership and school performance: Implications for policy development. Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, 14(1), 21‚Äì34. That is, the effective activities of instructional leaders, which affect student achievement and school performance, should be considered in the context of school and community environment. In this sense, the effort to measure the effects of instructional leadership without consideration of the school context might be avoided in empirical research.

It is distinguished by its prickly leaves and its flowers occurring in long sections of the branches. From 1922 to 2011 was known as Melaleuca coronicarpa. Description Melaleuca marginata is a prickly shrub, growing to a height of about . The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, more or less oval in shape, long and wide, crescent-shaped in cross section and tapering to a pointed, sharp end. The white flowers are in clusters of up to 25 flowers along the sides of the branches, each cluster up to in diameter. The style is long. The petals are long and fall off as the flower ages. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle containing between 10 and 22 stamens. Flowering occurs mainly in early spring and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules, with the sepals remaining as five teeth on each cup-shaped fruit. M. marginata leaves, flowers and fruit Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca coronicarpa was described in 1922 by Desmond Herbert however, a specimen formally described in 1845 by Otto Wilhelm Sonder as Astroloma marginatum was recognised in 2011 as the same species as the one named by Herbert. The type specimen described by Herbert was also found to be within the range of Melaleuca coronicarpa. Since the Sonder description had priority, it was renamed by Michael Hislop, Brendan Lepschi and Lyndley Craven. The name for this species is therefore now Melaleuca marginata. The specific epithet (marginata) is a Latin word meaning \\"border\\" or \\"margin\\" and refers to the distinctive leaf margin. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca marginata occurs from the Chapman Valley district south to the Ongerup district and east toward the Koorda and Grass Patch districts in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Esperance Plains, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions. It grows in sand including lateritic sand, loam and clay, on sandy ridges, eroded laterite and undulating plains. Conservation Melaleuca marginata is listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Studio International, 1950. Volume 140. Page 16. The Grosvenor School was a progressive art school, and the championing of wood engraving and linocuts fitted with its democratic approach to the arts.Jeanne Cannizzo, A Study in Contrast: Sybil Andrews and Gwenda Morgan. Art Gallery of Greater Victoria, Canada. 2015.  Works  Morgan was commissioned to illustrate a number of books published by private presses. For the Samson Press she produced the frontispiece for Duke Hamilton's Wager in 1934 and Pictures and Rhymes in 1936. She illustrated four books for the Golden Cockerel Press, including Thomas Gray's Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard (1946) and Grimms' Other Tales (1956). The main body of her work drew upon the landscape and buildings around Petworth and the neighbouring South Downs. Her work was inspired by that of Macnab, Percy Douglas Bliss and the Sussex-bred Eric Ravilious. Throughout the Second World War she worked as a Land Girl just outside Petworth. Her record of those years was published by the Whittington Press in 2002 as The Diary of a Land Girl, 1939-1945. Her prints are held in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum in London, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, among others. In 2015 an exhibition, \\"A Study in Contrast: Sybil Andrews and Gwenda Morgan\\", was held at the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, comparing and contrasting the fellow Grosvenor School artists. Some of her prints are on permanent display in the Leconfield Hall, Petworth, to which Morgan gave a substantial bequest on her death. Original wood engravings by Morgan are being sold in aid of the Leconfield Hall by the Kevis House Gallery in Petworth, who hold the largest collection of the artist's work.

Aristratus is named twice in Demosthenes speech On the Crown as one of the rulers who favoured the Macedonian king. In the first passage he is called an outcast by the orator. In the second passage he is mentioned together with another Sicyonian called Epichares, but it is not clear whether this man was an assistant, a colleague or a successor.Demosthenes, On the Crown 48 and 295. The fact that Aristratus was a tyrant is established by Plutarch in his biography of Aratus of Sicyon, where the author narrates the destruction of the former tyrants' portraits in the town hall of Sicyon after the reintroduction of democracy in 251 BC. According to Aratus' own memoirs, the most artful painting showed Aristratus with the goddess of victory Nike on a chariot. Although the artwork was by the hand of the famous painter Melanthius with the collaboration of the even more famous Apelles, Aratus insisted on its destruction, but his friend Nealkes convinced him to safe at least the goddess and cancel only the tyrant's face. Nealkes, a painter in his own right, then painted a palm where Aristratus stood, but forgot his feet which remained visible underneath the chariot.Plutarch, Aratus 13.

He was puzzled by the conventional wisdom that a supple suspension system was incompatible with good handling. He had been assigned the task of producing a car with both qualities.

Reception Bollywood Hungama: 'Sonu Nigam, who is always a delight to listen to, especially when it comes to soulful romantic tracks, strikes again with 'Abhi Mujh Mein Kahin'. Just the kind of song that was pretty much required to give a sense of completeness to Agneepath, this one also boasts of some poetic writing by Amitabh Bhattacharya.

Rediff: 'The album enters a dramatic mood shift when Sonu Nigam hits a silvery note to muse over the philosophy of life and its many challenges in the sentimental poetry and easygoing pace of Abhi Mujh Mein Kahin. Nicely done, Ajay-Atul.' Koimoi: 'Abhi mujh mein kahi is a soothing romantic track sung by Sonu Nigam. The song is mellow, gentle, romantic and contemplative.

Moskowitz (born 1940) is an American singer and songwriter, who was most notably a lead vocalist in the experimental rock band the United States of America. Moskowitz and the band, though not too commercially successful, produced some of the earliest examples of electronic rock. Following the band's demise, Moskowitz continued her music career, and was a member of Country Joe's All-Star Band. Biography Early life Throughout her childhood into her college years, Moskowitz played piano and learned proper vocal techniques through a variety of schoolings and work. In high school, she worked as an accompanist in a children's dance studio. During her studies at Barnard College, Moskowitz also began writing her first compositions, including the college's official Alma Mater song. Moskowitz commented on the experience saying, \\"Had I gone to a place like Oberlin, where there were serious musicians, I might never have had the audacity to do what I did. As it turned out, Barnard College taught me audacity, if nothing else. Its lack of music reputation wasn't a stumbling block. It was actually an opportunity in disguise.\\" Moskowitz eventually earned a degree in government, and briefly had a stint at Columbia University where she was informally trained by Otto Luening. In the spring of 1963, she met Joseph Byrd in New York and started a relationship with him. The two's first album they worked on was a Christmas album called The Life Treasury of Christmas Music, which was released in 1963. Together, they also developed a record series narrating the history of the United States in which Moskowitz produced, provided research, and liner notes. Later in 1963, the two moved to California to enroll in UCLA. It was here that Moskowitz learned about vocal styles of different cultures, and taught a class called \\"Feminism and I\\". She also contributed to an Indian-music album by Gayathri Rajapur and Harihar Rao in 1965. By 1966, Moskowitz and Byrd had separated, and she returned to New York for a year. Byrd then asked her to join his new band, the United States of America, which she did. The band designed its debut album to be more melodic in nature, but conflicts with the label would cause issues over who controlled the recording sessions. The United States of America In the summer of 1967, Moskowitz arrived to become a vocalist and songwriter in band activities. Moskowitz collaborated with Byrd in writing much of the band's material. Other members of the United States of America were Gordon Marron (electric violin, ring modulator), Rand Forbes (electric bass), Craig Woodson (drums, percussion), and Ed Bogas (organ, piano). Some of the band's compositions contained allusions to left-wing political themes. The band was innovative as they used early synthesizers, and other sound alterations to create a form of electronic avant-garde rock. Following a single live performance, the band was signed to the major Columbia label for what would be the group's only album in 1968. By the time recording started, Byrd and Moskowitz's influence proved to be central to the group's overall experimental sound. Recording of the album proved to be a trying task for the band and producer, David Rubinson. The band needed to hard-wire the components together, and the synthesizers, mixed on eight-track, were layered on one oscillator at a time. Moskowitz, in particular, sang through a ring modulator and electric filtering, which created a unique, eerie effect specific to the era. Every instrument, including the percussion playing, was electronically altered through amplifiers. The LP, The United States of America, was released in 1968 and charted at number 181 on the Billboard 200, but was still cited as a disappointment. It became relatively well known in the UK through the inclusion of one track, \\"I Won't Leave My Wooden Wife For You, Sugar\\", on a popular budget sampler album, The Rock Machine Turns You On. Following the release of the band's album, it conducted its only tour in which the band proved capable of replicating the album's material. However, the band suffered from the diverse personalities and political views, which caused inner turmoil. The final factor that resulted in the band's break-up stemmed from a gig in Orange County, California, in which three members were busted for possession of marijuana, leaving only Moskowitz and Byrd to perform. Commenting on her electrically affected vocals, Moskowitz stated, \\"I have no regrets about the electronic excess under which my voice was buried. It was part of the aesthetic and I was the one who insisted on singing through a ring modulator\\". Later career and life In 1972, Moskowitz became a featured member of Country Joe's All-Star Band, an experience she remembered fondly, saying: \\"I often refer to the Country Joe days as an example of the kind of musical life I had before raising a family and doing children's music\\". The group toured and was recorded live at the Fete, and the song, \\"Sweet Marie\\", appeared on the 1990 compilation album, The Best of Country Joe: The Vanguard Years. Moskowitz and the band also took part in McDonald's 1973 album, Paris Sessions. Later in the year, the band broke up, and Moskowitz went on to perform with several other acts like Steamin' Freeman. As a San Francisco- based voiceover artist in the mid-1970s, Moskowitz provided vocals for \\"Cracks,\\" a short cartoon produced for Sesame Street. In the 1980s and 1990s she composed music for children and briefly retired from music. In 2003, Moskowitz became a music teacher for elementary schools in Piedmont, California, introducing students to the basics of brass instruments and vocal techniques. She has two daughters.

Notably, from 1982 to 1993, she was the Superintendent of the School District of Philadelphia. Clayton holds distinctions of (i) being the first woman and (ii) the first African American to serve as Superintendent of Schools in Philadelphia. In 1992, the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education established the Constance E. Clayton Professorship, the first professorship to be established in the name of an African American woman at an Ivy League institution, and the second such professorship in the United States. Clayton is known for her \\"forceful persona\\" and \\"no-nonsense\\" approach and for her advocacy for children. Early life and education Constance Elaine Clayton was born in 1933 in Philadelphia to Levi Clayton (1906‚Äì1987) and Willabell Harris (maiden; 1910‚Äì2004). Her parents ‚Äì who married February 19, 1931, in Philadelphia ‚Äì separated September 1935, when she was two, and legally divorced on April 4, 1952. Constance was raised by her mother, Willabell Clayton, and maternal grandmother Sarah Harris. She has said of her childhood that \\"I had everything I needed and most of the things I wanted. I really was very fortunate.\\" Her mother took her to art museums, establishing a lifelong love for art. Clayton attended Paul Laurence Dunbar Elementary School and the Philadelphia High School for Girls. She credits lawyer Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander, the wife of civil rights attorney Raymond Pace Alexander, as one of her mentors. She received her B.A. and M.A. at Temple University in 1955, where she specialized in elementary school administration. She earned her Ph.D. from Pennsylvania State University in 1974, and a Doctor of Education degree (EdD) in educational administration from the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education in 1981. She was the national social action chairman of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority.  Teaching career  From 1955 to 1964 Clayton worked as a fourth grade teacher in the School District of Philadelphia at the William H. Harrison School in North Philadelphia. From 1964 to 1969 she designed social studies curricula for elementary grades. From 1969 to 1971 she was the head of a new African and Afro-American Studies program, addressing issues for students of all ages. During 1971-1972, she became director of the Women's Bureau for the Middle Atlantic States, working for the United States Department of Labor in Washington, D.C. to support women‚Äôs employment status and pay equity. From 1973 to 1983, she was first the director and then the associate superintendent of the Early Childhood Program for the Philadelphia school system. Under her direction, the program was seen as a national model. During this time she also went back to school, earning her Ph.D. in 1974, and her EdD in educational administration from the University of Pennsylvania‚Äôs Graduate School of Education in 1981.  Superintendent of Schools  In 1983, Constance Clayton defeated 83 other candidates to become the superintendent of the School District of Philadelphia. She was Philadelphia‚Äôs first African American woman superintendent. She served in the position from 1983 to 1993. She also became president-elect of the national Council of Great City Schools. The Philadelphia school system was the sixth largest school system in the United States, employing approximately 24,500 teachers, administrators, and support staff at over 250 locations. Challenges included the extreme poverty of much of the student body and a budget deficit. Clayton set a number of goals for the city‚Äôs schools, including balancing the budget, standardizing the curriculum, and attracting private sector support. At the end of her first 8 years as superintendent, the school system had been largely successful in meeting those goals. Clayton was a moral voice in support of children in the education system, emphasizing that \\"Somebody had better step forward and be the advocate for kids.\\" She emphasized the need for federal, state, and city governments to all make a \\"concrete investment\\" in education. She recognized the difficulties faced by many children, and promoted programs to address their needs, including the Homeless Student Initiative, America 2000, a broader sexual education program, and acceptance of pregnant students who wish to graduate. \\"We must educate the kids born into poverty and despair. We must value all kids and not just a select few.\\" \\"We have enormously talented kids who have a great deal of potential, children who are aspiring.\\" According to Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Claude Lewis, Clayton \\"made meaningful improvement and provided a measure of hope for students and teachers alike who live with despair.\\" She retired in 1993.  Philadelphia Museum of Art  Since her retirement, Constance Clayton has continued to be active in the community and to serve on the boards of a number of institutions. These include the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where she serves on the board of trustees. In 2000 she founded the museum's African American Collections Committee. Her work with the museum has led to the creation of the exhibits Treasures of Ancient Nigeria (1982) and Represent: 200 Years of African American Art (2014).

Planned as a high-rise condominium complex, construction of the building was halted during the 1997 Asian financial crisis, when it was already about 80 percent complete. It is now among the most prominent of Bangkok's many derelict buildings, and has become a destination for urban explorers. History The Sathorn Unique was planned as a 47 storey luxury condominium tower with 600 units. The building was designed and developed by Rangsan Torsuwan, a prominent architect and real estate developer who also designed Sathorn Unique's sister building, the State Tower. The project was launched in 1990 and was owned by Sathorn Unique Co. Ltd. and mainly financed by the Thai Mex Finance and Securities Company. Construction began in that same year with Si Phraya Co. Ltd. being the main contractor in charge. Dilapidated interior of the building In 1993, in a controversial case that would drag on for fifteen years, Rangsan was arrested for allegedly plotting to murder the President of the Supreme Court, Praman Chansue (the murder never took place). Rangsan was found guilty in 2008 but later acquitted by the Court of Appeals in 2010. The case, however, markedly disrupted Rangsan's ability to secure financial support for his projects, and construction of the Sathorn Unique suffered delays due to lack of funds. When the Asian financial crisis hit in 1997, Bangkok's real estate market collapsed, and the finance companies that had funded the project went bankrupt and were subsequently liquidated. Construction projects across the city came to a halt, and Bangkok was left with over 300 unfinished high-rise projects. Most of these buildings (State Tower among them) have since been completed as the economy recovered, but Sathorn Unique remains among Bangkok's dozen-plus unfinished \\"ghost towers\\", despite negotiations and refinancing efforts by Rangsan's son Pansit Torsuwan, who had joined Rangsan's firm in 2004. This was largely due to Rangsan's insistence that the project only be sold off at a price that would allow the building's original buyers to be repaid in full, instead of declaring bankruptcy and dissolving the company. Location, design and status View from the top Sathorn Unique Tower is off Charoen Krung Road, between Sois 51 and 53, in Bangkok's Sathon District. It sits roughly opposite Wat Yan Nawa and is near the end of Sathon Road, where Taksin Bridge and the Saphan Taksin Station of the BTS Skytrain are located. The building, whose design features 49 storeys (including two underground levels), occupies approximately two rai () of land, and is connected to an adjacent ten-storey parking garage. Rangsan's style has been described as \\"exultant post-modernism, architectural pastiche in which styles and eras are thrown together without any signs of restraint\\". Like its sister building, the State Tower, Sathorn Unique's design features liberal use of neo-Grecian elements, especially in its columns and balconies. While the building's core structure has been largely completed (construction is estimated to be 80‚Äì90 percent complete) and its structural integrity regarded as secure, interior and infrastructural work had barely begun when construction stopped, and the walls and structural details, especially of the upper levels, also remain incomplete. Graffiti at the top The building has become known as an urban exploration destination, and has also received attention from international visitors. Despite being officially off-limits to the public, access reportedly can be gained by bribing security guards on the premises. The building reappeared in the news in December 2014, when the body of a Swedish man was found hanged on the 43rd floor. The cause of death was determined to be suicide, though the news prompted discussion regarding the safety and security of the building. In September 2015, Pansit Torsuwan, now a member of the board of Sathorn Unique Co., revealed that he had filed criminal charges of trespassing against five people who had posted material on the Internet, including a pair of foreigners who had created a video of themselves freerunning on the tower. He said that this was done in order to set an example and deter people from climbing the building, which is dangerous. He added that the number of people illegally entering the premises had risen sharply during the past year, following an increase in online exposure, with over a hundred people entering on some weekends. In 2017, Pansit allowed Museum Siam to host a seminar at the building as part of its exhibition commemorating the twentieth anniversary of the financial crisis. He also allowed the building to be used as the location of GDH 559 horror film The Promise. There are several superstitions surrounding the building held by people in the nearby communities. Some believe the building is haunted, as the land upon which it sits is probably a former graveyard. Others believe the location of the building, whose shadow is cast upon the neighbouring Wat Yan Nawa, to be inauspicious, resulting in its failed completion.

Born in Oakland, California, Wong was granted a Bachelor of Arts in English from the University of California, Berkeley in 1960, qualifying as a teacher as California State University, Hayward a year later. Her intent was initially to teach high school students, but she found that it was more enjoyable to teach small children, and focused on a career doing that; this ended when she had her own children and left the teaching profession. Wong began studying art in 1978, attending DeAnza College until 1980 followed by a stint at Foothill College until 1982. In 1990 she and Jan Rindfleisch curated the exhibition Families: Rebuilding, Recreating, Reinventing at the Euphrat Museum of Art, This exhibition featured artwork by other notable Asian American Artists: Terry Acebo Davis, Kim Anno, Lucy Arai, Lenore Chinn, DIWA Arts & Anna Wong. These Artists's whose work was already known in the Asian American Artistic communities would later reciprocate by including Oy-Wong's work in other political and identity exhibitions they curated at other SF Bay Area venues during that dynamic period. Flo two years later was given the Art and the Needs of Children and Youth Award. In 1995, Wong was awarded the Pr by the Women‚Äôs Caucus for Art, and served as a visiting scholar at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. In 1997 she was awarded fellowships by both the Arts Council of Santa Clara and the Nebraska Arts Council. In 2000 her piece made in usa: Angel Island Shhh was installed at the United States Immigration Station, Angel Island, where between 100,000 and 175,000 Chinese immigrants had been detained, influenced by the experiences of her mother and mother-in- law who had immigrated from China.

The album debuted at #7 on Billboard's Comedy Albums chart for the week ending July 27, 2013.  Songs  \\"Nothing to Prove\\", a response to the misogynistic \\"fake geek girl\\" concept within geek culture, is the most important of the tracks on the album. \\"Lasers and Feelings\\", \\"The Mystery's Gone\\" and \\"Oh, Mr. Darcy\\" are about relationships. \\"Lasers and Feelings\\" is a love song to a supervillain with a \\"ska-style upbeat rhythm that underpins a clever lyrical turn\\" \\"The Mystery's Gone\\", a \\"jazzy rock number\\", is about a Twitter romance that came to a disappointing end when the couple meet in real life. \\"Oh, Mr. Darcy\\" is from the duo's earlier Chainmail and Cello album, covering mixed feelings about Colin Firth in the 1980 BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice and a bad relationship in Laser's past. \\"Can't You See The World Is Ending\\" shares the themes of procrastination with \\"Something Else\\" and bad relationships with \\"Oh, Mr. Darcy\\". Aubrey sings on \\"Something Else\\" and \\"Christmas Ain't About Me.\\" She is described as a \\"post-modern chanteuse\\" on the former, while the latter is an \\"easy-to-swallow tango form\\". (The latter is a reworking of the title song of the EP of the same name, with an entirely different tune.) \\"The Guy Who Yelled Freebird\\" is a comedic song about \\"rock's oldest joke\\" of requesting Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"Free Bird\\" regardless of performer or style. \\"Rock Star Life\\", a \\"intoxicating blend of Dixieland and country-rock\\", is similarly referencing life in a band; in this case the hardships of touring. \\"Impostor\\" is a new version of a Song Fu entry from January 2012. The song is a \\"positively haunting\\" tribute to NASA's Curiosity Mars rover and the topic of self-esteem issues, which will \\"ruin your day. Or to speed up the invention of a method to send hugs through intrastellar radio wave transmissions.\\"  Reception  Lasers and Feelings debuted at #7 on Billboard's Comedy Albums chart for the week ending July 27, 2013. When questioned about the category in an interview with Wired, Laser said \\"We don‚Äôt really write for a genre in mind, but I think Lasers and Feelings probably got classified as comedy because there are several songs on there that really are straight-up comedy ('The Guy Who Yelled Freebird,' for example).\\" \\"Z\\" of GeekDad said that Lasers and Feelings \\"pushes the envelope regarding what geek music can and should be\\". Expanding on this, in light of the increasingly mainstream nature of geek culture, this album is \\"indicative of a shifting paradigm within the geek music meta-community that runs simultaneously complementary and counter to the integration of nerdier fare into the broader entertainment world.\\" Being able to appeal to both \\"hardcore\\" and \\"casual\\" fans allows The Doubleclicks, and similar bands, the freedom to write songs that cover general personal issues, geeky subjects, and geek culture itself. Along with the importance of \\"Nothing To Prove\\", \\"standout track\\" of the album, Erik Henriksen of The Portland Mercury highlights the songs \\"Can't You See The World Is Ending\\" and \\"The Mystery's Gone\\" some of The Doubleclicks' best work.  Track listing   Credits  The lyrics and music for the album were written by Laser Malena- Webber and Aubrey Turner, with the exception of \\"Something Else\\" and \\"The Mystery's Gone\\".

He also performed additional accompaniment for some songs on guitars, mandolin, piano, synth, banjo, percussion and bass. Their mother, Susan Webber, was on bass for \\"The Guy Who Yelled Freebird\\".

Osborne was an American journalist, hotel owner, and government official from Gloucester, Massachusetts. Early life Osborne was born in Vermont. In 1886, he graduated from Dartmouth College. While at Dartmouth, Osborne was a member of the Dartmouth Big Green baseball team. Journalism After college, Osborne went to work as a reporter for the Springfield Republican. In 1890 moved to Gloucester and became a Cape Ann correspondent for the Boston Herald. Hoteling In 1893, Osborne acquired an interest in East Gloucester's Harbor View Hotel. In 1896 he was assaulted by a patron during a dispute over the guest's cousin's bill. Around 1903, he left the Herald to go into the hotel business full-time. Politics Osborne's first political involvement came as a member of the Democratic Party. Around 1896 he switched to the Republican Party. In 1899 he was elected to the Gloucester Republican Committee as a representative from Ward 1. He represented Ward 1 on the Gloucester Commons Council and was the president of that body in 1903. Collector of Customs In 1911, U.S. Representative Augustus Peabody Gardner chose to base his recommendation for Collector of Customs for the Port of Gloucester on balloting in Gloucester. The incumbent collector William H. Jordan and Gloucester Republican City Committee Chairman Ralph W. Dennen both ran for the position. Osborne initially supported Jordan, as Osborne did not believe anyone was going challenge him, but switched his endorsement when Dennen entered the race. Jordan won the race handedly, however, there was ample evidence that many of the ballots turned in were filled out fraudulently. According to Gardner, the signatures on many of the ballots voting for Jordan were obvious imitations or bore absolutely no resemblance to the genuine signatures of the men who were propertied to have signed it. Some of the signatures even contained misspellings of the alleged voter's name or initials. A number of ballots also appeared to be written by the same hand. As a result of this fraud, Gardner refused to recommend Jordan. However, because he believed Jordan would still have won without the fraudulent ballots, he refused to recommend Dennen as well. Instead he recommended that Osborne be nominated for the position. Although he was not recommended by Gardner, Jordan went to Washington to make a case for his reappointment. After Jordan's presentation, President William Howard Taft was torn between the two men. However, he chose to appoint Osborne based on the recommendation of Treasury Secretary Franklin MacVeagh. As Collector, Osborne oversaw a Customs district that included Gloucester, Rockport, Manachester, and Essex. He supervised a staff of fifteen Customs employees and the use of the Customs yacht, Dreamer. He received a salary of $300 a year, however various fees were estimated to put his pay between $4,000 and $5,000 a year. Osborne remained Collector until July 1, 1913, when all customs districts in Massachusetts were combined into one district and the position was eliminated. Personal life and death In 1895, Osborne married Harriet C. Brazier. In addition to their home in Gloucester, the Osbornes also had a winter home in Brighton. Osborne died on October 8, 1918, due to complications from surgery.
