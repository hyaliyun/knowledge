Located in Sofiyivka, Halytskyi district. It was considered the most beautiful park in interwar Poland.  History  The outskirts of Lviv in ancient times consisted of sandy ravines, steep ravines and valleys. The arrangement of the park began in 1879 on the initiative of city councilor Stanislav Nemchynovsky. Stryiskiy Park was designed by the famous master of landscape art Arnold Rering, an engineer of urban plantations, in 1876‚Äì1877 on the territory of the former so-called ‚Äúfirst‚Äù Stryiskiy Cemetery, which was closed in 1823. A total of 40,000 trees were planted: spruce, maple, sycamore, exotic species such as red oak, tulip tree, red beech, ginkgo. In 1887, the Lviv City Council considered the construction of a monument to Jan Kilinski, one of the participants in the uprising led by Tadeusz Kosciuszko. The construction site was a newly created park, which was named Kilinski Park. As early as 1888, work began on the construction of a monument commissioned by the famous Ukrainian sculptor Hryhoriy Kuznevych and Yulian Markovsky. For this purpose the stone block was delivered from Mykolayiv. The monument was unveiled on June 18, 1895, where it still stands. However, the name \\"Kilinski Park\\" did not take root, and the name \\"Stryiskiy Park\\" proved to be more popular and has stood the test of time. Initially, the park was only its lower part. The top was a wasteland. On it, in 1894, the National Exhibition was held, for which numerous exhibition pavilions were built. Prior to this event, an electric tram was opened in Lviv, and a tram track was brought to the territory. During World War I, an Austrian pilot was killed in Stryiskiy Park, and his grave was established near the Palace of Arts. In November 1918, there were graves of Ukrainian riflemen, who were exhumed and reburied in the cemetery–ö—Ä–∏–ø'—è–∫–µ–≤–∏—á –Ü. –Ü—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–Ω—ñ –ø—Ä–æ—Ö–æ–¥–∏ –ø–æ –õ—å–≤–æ–≤—ñ‚Ä¶ ‚Äî –°. 114.. From 1922 until the beginning of the World War II, the park hosted the exhibition-fair \\"Targi Wschodnie\\", for which local government brought narrow-gauge railways for the delivery of goods and passengers from the station Persenkivka. Stanislav Lem often mentions this annual exhibition. In the 1930s, a radio tower was built here. In the 1920s, one of Lviv's guides wrote: In 1951, the narrow-gauge tracks used to service the Targi Wschodnie were partially dismantled and partially used to create the Lviv Children's Railway. In 1952, the main entrance to the park was decorated with a light arch of the Corinthian order designed by Soviet architect Heinrich Shvetsky-Vinetsky. During the Soviet period, the park area was enlarged due to wastelands and unused areas, a cast-iron fence was installed, and new species of trees and shrubs were planted. In 2008, the first skatepark in Ukraine was opened in the upper part of Stryiskiy Park. In 2009, a monument to Jan Kilinski was restored with funds provided by the Government of the Republic of Poland. Reconstruction of the park has been going on since 2009, in particular, external lighting is being restored, paths are being bridged. In June 2011, the restoration of the \\"Ivasyk-Telesyk\\" fountain was completed. UAH 2.4 million has been allocated from the city budget for these needs.

It is located in the Halytskyi district of Lviv, between Ivana Franka, Stryiska, Ulas Samchuk and Kozelnytska streets. It consists of three landscape parts: * the zone of the lower parterres - on the bottom of the beam * forest park zone - on the slopes of the beam * the upper terrace, which is actually the territory of the former exhibition \\"Targi Wschodnie\\". The basis of the park territory planning is a deep erosion valley, through which the Soroka stream flowed (left tributary of the Poltva); now there is a footpath that connects the upper terrace with the lower part of the park. There are more than 200 species of trees and plants in the Stryiskiy Park, there is a greenhouse, a rock garden, a sycamore and a lime alley. There is growing red oak, tulip tree, magnolia, Weymouth pine, Japanese lilac, Manchurian aralia, ginkgo biloba. Not far from the main gate there is a pond with swans.

Mortiz Sch√∂nfeld was the author of several reference works on Germanic names and Dutch etymology which have been highly influential and are still in use today. Biography Moritz Sch√∂nfeld was born in Groningen, Netherlands on 9 February 1880. His father taught mathematics and physics at the municipal gymnasium in Groningen. Sch√∂nfeld began his studies at the University of Groningen in 1898, where he gained a PhD on Dutch literature in 1904. Sch√∂nfeld taught Dutch and geography in Meppel from 1905 to 1908, in Tilburg from 1908 to 1913, and at the municipal gymnasium in Hilversum until his retirement in 1945. At Hilversum, Sch√∂nfeld was the acting deputy principal for many years. Combined with his teaching duties, Sch√∂nfeld was a prominent scholar and editor. He was elected a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1930. Research Sch√∂nfeld specialized in the study of Germanic personal names, and ethnonyms. His 1906 doctoral thesis on this subject was published in German with the title W√∂rterbuch der altgermanischen Personen- und V√∂lkernamen nach der √úberlieferung des Klassischen Altertums bearbeitet (1911). It has remained the standard reference work on the subject up to the present day. From 1917 to 1930, Sch√∂nfeld was contributed to a number of articles in the Realencyclop√§die der classischen Altertumswissenschaft, published by Georg Wissowa. In 1921, Sch√∂nfeld published the first edition of his Historiese grammatika van het Nederlands. Schets van de klank- en vormleer. It has since been published in more than eight revised editions, and remains the standard reference work on Dutch grammar. Towards the end of his life, Sch√∂nfeld published Veldnamen in Nederland (1949) and Nederlandse waternamen (1955), both are important reference works on Dutch etymology.

She represented Australia in the 55th Venice Biennale of 2013, and her works are held in the permanent collections of the Mus√©e du quai Branly, Paris, the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney, the Queensland Art Gallery and Gallery of Modern Art, the Art Gallery of South Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria and the Art Gallery of Western Australia. Early life Gabori was born at Mirdidingki on the south side of Bentinck Island, the largest island in the South Wellesley Group in the southern Gulf of Carpentaria, Queensland, Australia. As a young woman she lived a traditional lifestyle on Bentinck Island, largely uninfluenced by Europeans. She gathered food, including shellfish, from the complex system of stone fish traps her people had built in the shallows around the island. She helped to build and maintain the stone walls of the fish traps, was an adept maker of string, and weaver of dillybags and coolamons, and a respected singer of Kaiadilt songs, which tell of the close ties her people had with their country. Gabori's tribal name is Mirdidingkingathi Juwarnda. Juwarnda means 'dolphin', her totemic sign, and Mirdidingkingathi means 'born at Mirdidingki', in her country on the south side of Bentinck Island. The English name Gabori comes from her husband Pat Gabori, and is a corruption of his birthplace name, Kabararrjingathi. Severe drought in 1942‚Äì45 and a cyclone in 1948 made Bentinck Island uninhabitable, and Presbyterian missionaries moved the entire Kaiadilt people to nearby Mornington Island.A small outstation was established on Bentinck Island in 1986 and some Kaiadilt people returned. Gabori did not return with them because her husband was too frail, but was able to visit occasionally. Career In 2005, when she was 81, Sally and Pat Gabori were living in the Aged Person Hostel at Gununa on Mornington Island. Brett Evans had established the Mornington Island Arts and Crafts Centre to produce and market traditional crafts, including Gabori's fine weaving. She was offered paints for the first time at a workshop in April 2005. The Kaiadilt community had no two-dimensional art traditions before 2005, so Gabori had nothing to draw on but her memory of her country. When Indigenous artist Melville Escott looked at Gabori's first painting, he could identify \\"the river, sandbar, ripples the fish leave on the water, her brother King Alfred's country and the fish traps she used to look after\\". Her enthusiasm for painting grew until she was painting five days a week, every day the centre was open. Towards the end of her career, Gabori painted collaborative works with two of her daughters, and encouraged her other daughters into the art centre, to help develop a new generation of Kaiadilt painters. Over the short eight years of her painting career, she produced over 2000 paintings, and almost all major institutions in Australia acquired her works. Gabori's work has featured in over 28 solo exhibitions and been part of more than 100 group exhibitions.Artist CV available from Alcaston Gallery Style Her works have been described as abstract expressionism and gestural abstraction, but art theory was not an influence on her work, since Gabori had little English. Many of her paintings represent the sea, sky and land of her country, but she is thought to be not so much engaging with an audience as engaging with her country.

Under his leadership and with his direct participation together with specialists in the field of mathematics, programming and information technology, a set of mathematical models was developed and implemented. These models are intended for estimation and forecasting of: * the impact of certain taxes (income tax, VAT, social security contributions) and their complex on industrial enterprises' activities (1998); * the impact of tax treatment applied by different tax jurisdictions on directions of international capital migration and foreign direct investments (2002); * the impact of VAT on national production, consumption, savings and budget revenues through the prism of three interrelated sectors ‚Äî households, production and the public sector (2004); * the impact of taxes paid by commercial banks as financial intermediaries between final investors and enterprises on the real economy development (2005); * the consequences of authorities' decisions in the budget and tax area on the economy of certain regions and Ukraine as a whole (2007‚Äì2013); * the shadow economy level at the regional level (case study for Donetsk region) (2014); * the impact of digitalization processes on the national economy (2018); * technology gaps between Ukraine and developed EU countries using the concept of S-shaped technology curves (2019).

It rises on the Akragas point, near the mouth of the Akragas river.  History  Known for being the seaside resort of the City of Temples, it takes its name from Pope Leo II (682 - 683). Originally the area was occupied by the emporium (port) of the Greek city which was continuously frequented until the Arab period. The emporium had already been occupied by Mycenaean navigators around the middle of the second millennium BC from which they supplied themselves with sulfur and rock salt. The fortified village discovered by Mosso at the beginning of the twentieth century dates back to this period. In the seventh century BC the Greeks of Gela established a commercial port, documented by the nearby necropolis of Montelusa (a hill west of the current settlement). In the Middle Ages monks settled in San Leone, but as it was unsuitable for landing Medieval ships, it was abandoned in favor of Porto Empedocle. Not much remains of the Greek period, also because the district has been heavily urbanized in the past century. In the sixteenth century, Italian historian Tommaso Fazello noticed in the area of the mouth of the saxa quadrata the remains of the docks of the classic port that stretched along the banks of the river. Certainly, as was the custom among the ancients, there were large 'hangars' where military ships were pulled ashore and docks for commercial activities. The port's activity and scale had to be intense considering the importance of the city, as evidenced by the significant number of coins found in the area ranging from the classical to the Byzantine and finally Arab period, confirming that the emporium was in use until about the 10th-11th century. Mysterious ritual sacrifices of oriental (Egyptian) origin perhaps identify small foreign commercial colonies or influences on local cults. In the 19th century a hand mill was founded in the vicinity of the Caruso house, which was used until the 1920s. Until about 1900 an ancient building with a semicircular vault of clear Roman origins existed near the church of San Leone, where a large family of fishermen lived. It was demolished by Commendatore Alfonso Caratozzolo to build the building that can still be seen near the former Arena Estiva. Among the other artifacts discovered in San Leone in the late 19th and early 20th century were buildings of Roman origin, and Arab warehouses. A huge Greek sarcophagus was also discovered near the church of San Leone, formed by a single block of sandstone, but was unfortunately cut into four parts and transformed into seats on the beach. The church of San Leone was built around the 13th century, but was exposed to the attacks of the Barbary corsairs. A watchtower was built in the sixteenth century by Tiburzio Spannocchi (1578). The tower, which still exists, stands on the heights of the Forgia district and is used, together with the farm that has developed around it, for tourist accommodation activities. In the eighteenth century the enlightened bishop Lorenzo Gioeni (1730 - 1754) built a summer holiday home for young people that still today dominates the woods and the beach of Maddalusa from the top of the Montelusa hill. The bishop himself had considered the site of San Leone as an area to build the port of Girgenti. The project was rejected for several reasons and in 1749 the works for the construction of the port were carried out in the beach of the Porto Empedocle, which had been fortified in 1544 during the reign of Charles V. In the 19th century, San Leone was once again populated as a holiday area by the people of Agrigento. The Caruso houses were built in the current Trinacria square. The oldest of these is the Caratozzolo house on the seafront, the so-called 'Cevuzu' (mulberry) in Sicilian language and several villas in Liberty style. A wooden chalet was built in the first half of the last century, while the bathing establishment was built in the 1950s. During the Second World War the Italian army fortified San Leone by closing the roads that lead to the waterfront and repulsed an attempted landing by US troops. From the 1060s, San Leone witnessed uncontrolled development that has transformed it from a small fishing village to a chaotic seaside resort crowded during the summer by about 30,000 vacationers, while the stable population is about 4,000 people. Today San Leone is welded to the neighboring agglomerations of Villaggio Peruzzo, Villaggio Mos√®, Cannatello and Fiume Naro with which is included in the district of San Leone Mos√®'s total of 13,012 inhabitants. In the 1970s, the waterfront was enlarged in its present form and the port was built, and in the 1990s, a helipad was built which is no longer used  Archaeology  There are few traces of the Greek port, limited to the presence of the oldest Greek necropolis of Agrigento, on the hill of Montelusa, which has returned important artifacts of archaic Greek art. Little is left in the inhabited area as most of the finds have been either adapted for other uses or, as regards the port infrastructures still visible a century ago, buried by the gravel brought by the sea and by the floods of the river. In the vicinity of San Leone, and precisely in Cannatello, there are the remains of a settlement-emporium, discovered in the early twentieth century by Angelo Mosso dating back to the 14th-12th century BC. It is considered the most representative site, together with Thapsos, of the Bronze Age culture in Sicily. The excavation delimited the emerging part of the village chief, which is the fortified part where the ruling family resided and where the inhabitants of the surroundings took refuge during enemy raids. The Sican village appears delimited by a mighty double circle of curved walls with a thickness of about 8 meters. The inner circle of walls is the oldest and suffered a violent fire, the second took the place of the first. Inside there are the remains of circular and rectilinear huts. Three successive phases of settlement were recognized. In the area, Aegean-Cypriot pottery and an urn containing four spearheads, two swords and a bronze hatchet were found. With this discovery, the hypothesis of an Aegean-Cypriot contribution in the 13th century BC in the area of the Agrigento marina took hold. This area was already frequented from the early Bronze Age by the Aegean-Cypriots who obtained sulfur from the mines of Monte Grande, perhaps the oldest sulfur mine in the Western world. Sulfur was a very precious mineral in ancient times, a real catalyst of human progress as it was useful for reaching the melting temperature of metals. Sulphur was also used to purify and disinfect. The Cannatello emporium functioned, as Monte Grande did in the 18th century BC, as a port of call for sulfur, rock salt and probably also bitumen for the Aegean- Cypriot navigators, who used this beach as intermediate base for the routes that connected Cyprus and the Aegean with North Africa and the Sardinian and Iberian West.

He played as defender. Burri first played for local team FC Birsfelden in the fourth tier of Swiss football. He joined FC Basel's first team for their 1961‚Äì62 season under manager Ji≈ô√≠ Sobotka. Burri played his first game for his new club in the 1961‚Äì62 International Football Cup game away against Sparta Rotterdam. In this game he also scored his first goal for Basel, but this could not save the team from a 2‚Äì5 defeat. He played his domestic league debut for the club in the home game at the Landhof on 16 September as Basel were defeated 1‚Äì2 by Luzern. He scored his first league goal for his club on 4 March 1962 in the home game as Basel won 4‚Äì3 against Fribourg. In their 1962‚Äì63 season Basel won the Swiss Cup as they beat the favourites Grasshopper Club Z√ºrich in the Final. In the Wankdorf Stadium on 15 April 1963 Heinz Blumer and Otto Ludwig scored the goals as Basel won 2‚Äì0. A well-documented curiosity was the fact that during the winter break of their 1963‚Äì64 season the team travelled on a world tour. This saw them visit British Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, French Polynesia, Mexico and the United States. First team manager Ji≈ô√≠ Sobotka together with 16 players and 15 members of staff, supporters and journalists participated in this world tour from 10 January to 10 February 1964. Team captain Bruno Michaud filmed the events with his super-8 camara. The voyage around the world included 19 flights and numerous bus and train journeys. Club chairman, Lucien Schmidlin, led the group, but as they arrived in the hotel in Bangkok, he realised that 250,000 Swiss Francs were missing. The suitcase that he had filled with the various currencies was not with them. He had left it at home, but fortunately Swiss Air were able to deliver this to him within just a few days. During the tour a total of ten friendly/test games were played, these are listed in their 1963‚Äì64 season. Five wins, three draws, two defeats, but also three major injuries resulted from these test matches. A broken leg for Peter F√ºri, an eye injury for Walter Baumann and a knee injury for Bruno Michaud soon reduced the number of players to just 13. Burri was a member of this tour. He played in eight of the games and scored two goals. Burri stayed with Basel for three seasons. Between the years 1961 and 1964 Burri played a total of 67 games for Basel scoring a total of 13 goals. 35 of these games were in the Nationalliga A, three in the Swiss Cup, one in the Cup of the Alps, one in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, five in the International Football Cup and 22 were friendly games. He scored three goals in the domestic league, one in the Swiss Cup, four in the International Football Cup and the other five were scored during the test games. After his time with Basel, Burri moved on to play three seasons with Cantonal Neuchatel and then two seasons with La Chaux-de-Fonds. ReferencesSources * Die ersten 125 Jahre.

Youth and education  Huchzermeyer was born in Klaswipper, today part of Wipperf√ºrth in the Oberbergischer Kreis in the administrative district of Cologne, as the son of the Lutheran pastor Carl Huchzermeyer (1858-1929). He was educated at the St√§dtisches Gymnasium in Wipperf√ºrth until his Abitur in 1924. Throughout his school years, he received solid training in organ, piano and violin playing as well as in theoretical subjects (including musical composition) from the seminar music teachers Georg Beringer and Alfons Schmetz at the teacher training college in Wipperf√ºrth. Until 1929, he studied Latin, Greek and possibly religious education at the universities of Cologne, Marburg and M√ºnster. At the same time, he studied musicology with Ernst B√ºcken (Cologne), Hermann Stephani (Marburg) and Fritz Volbach (M√ºnster). The latter, coming from Wipperf√ºrth, became his special mentor. In 1930, Huchzermeyer received his doctorate in M√ºnster with a thesis on \\"Ancient Greek music Aulos and Kithara in Greek music until the end of the classical period\\" (printed 1931). This work is regarded as a standard work and is even today only outdated in a few points.  Professional background and activities  After working as a teacher and assessor at various grammar schools, the problem arose in 1933 that there was no need for grammar school teachers (especially classical philologists). Only by working exclusively as a music teacher, most recently at the girls' secondary school in Osnabr√ºck, did Huchzermeyer obtain a budget position as a student councilor. From 1940 to 1946, he was a soldier or in English captivity. From 1948, he was a student councillor at the , a boys' school, where he devoted himself to the old languages. In 1951, he was appointed to the Oberstudienrat and entrusted with the management of the Studienseminar. He now no longer gave music lessons, but put together a respectable school orchestra, which had been lacking until then, which he led until 1960 and which performed regularly on festive occasions and with its own concerts. At the same time, he founded a wind band. In the early years in M√∂nchengladbach, he again became interested in music of ancient Greece. One result was the setting to music of Antigone by Sophocles for choir (in the original language), speaker and large orchestra. The occasion was the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Stiftisches Gymnasium as a full institution in 1952. Huchzermeyer retired in 1967. His compositional output, his first attempts at composition were made at the age of ten, comprises over 61 works in various genres. Sacred compositions make up about one third of his complete works. Huchzermeyer had been married to Charlotte, n√©e R√ºther (1915-1993) since 1935. The couple had two children, one son is the internist and musicologist Hans Huchzermeyer. Huchzermeyer died in Minden at the age of 79 and is buried in Klaswipper.

He was born in Buenos Aires but is mostly connected by historians to the San Antonio de Areco area. His uncle was the famed writer, Ricardo G√ºiraldes.

Background  Railcar used in the 1960s and 1970s The idea of using DMUs is not new to KTMB. In 1960, the company operated diesel railcars on short distance services. The railcars operated in multiple unit formation until the mid 1970s, when they were converted into trailers and coupled with conventional diesel locomotives. In the 1980s, KTM ordered railbuses for similar services, but these services ended in the 1990s. Secondhand DMUs were also proposed for KTM Komuter services to make up for the shortage of EMUs, but in the end new KTM Class 92s were ordered instead.  Procurement  In 2015, the Business Times reported that KTMB had signed a deal for DMUs with Majestic Engineering, in which the DMUs will be supplied by CRRC. KTMB confirmed its intentions to get DMUs in 2016, pointing out its higher speeds compared to locomotive hauled trains In 2017, KTMB formally announced the procurement of 13 DMUs along with 9 ETS sets from CRRC. The trains were constructed from 2018 to 2020 by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive. The first two sets were built in CRRC‚Äôs factory in Zhuzhou, China whereas the remaining eleven were built in CRRC‚Äôs factory in Batu Gajah, Malaysia.  Description  The trains have a design speed of 140 km/h and are expected to operate at up to 120 km/h. They are equipped with graphene-based supercapacitors for storing braking energy and two MAN powerpacks. The diesel engines can be replaced with fuel cells to reach zero emissions operation. The trains are fitted with a Wireless Train Tracker tool for location detection. Since the trains are used on non-upgraded sections where platform heights are lower, the trains are fitted with retractable steps to aid passengers in boarding. The train bodies themselves are specified to meet the European EN15227 crashworthiness standard.  Facilities  The trains feature digital passenger information systems, a prayer room and a light catering bar. Nine of the 13 trainsets will have one-third of a vehicle dedicated to carrying parcels and have commuter style seating i.e. a combinition of transverse and longitudinal seating layouts. Such trains are meant for regional services such as the Shuttle Timur service. The remaining four sets have 2+2 transverse seating and are meant for long distance travel.  Service History  The trains are scheduled to enter service from 1 October 2020, on the Ekspres Selatan from Gemas to JB Sentral. Eventually they will be deployed on the East Coast Line once track rehabilitation and upgrading of station facilities is completed. When in service, they are expected to cut journey times as their operating speed of 100 km/h is higher then the average speed of existing trains which is at 50‚Äì60 km/h.

Founded in the 12th century, it is one of the oldest Gothic churches in the country. History Main nave of the Virgin Mary church, Wroc≈Çaw, Poland (2017) At the end of the eleventh century the descendants of Count Palatine and the great Polish nobleman Piotr W≈Çostowic allowed the construction of a Romanesque church on this small island, hence its name on the Sand. This powerful family was involved in the evangelization of Silesia. It is dedicated to the Virgin Mary, patron saint of the governor's wife (statthalter), Maria W≈Çast. The tympanum above the entrance portal shows a statue of the Virgin and Child with a small statue of the kneeling foundress, Maria W≈Çast, holding her son in her arms next to it. Gothic church The Romanesque church was demolished in the 14th century to make way for a larger Gothic church, built in brick between 1334 and 1430 according to the plans of the architect Master Peschel. It was supposed to have two towers, but the north tower was never completed. The nave, lit by huge windows, is 78 meters long. The Gothic vaults rise to 24 meters high. Additional work took place in the following centuries, including the construction of the Chapel of the Holy Cross by Antonio Coldin in 1666. It is the oldest baroque construction in the city. The church was sacked by Swedish troops in 1632 during the Thirty Years' War. A century later, lightning struck the south tower destroying its roof, while a few days earlier the new 4.7 ton bell had just been blessed. During the Seven Years' War, the Prussians used the church as an ammunition depot. Second World War Hitler made Breslau a fortified city in 1944. When the Soviet troops advanced to the west in 1945, the Sandkirche and the buildings served as headquarters for the German army, which was conscious of fighting a dead-end battle. General Hermann von Niehoff commanded the 371st Infantry Division. During the fighting, most of Breslau's historical monuments were destroyed or severely damaged. The Sandkirche also burned down. The baroque interior disappeared completely, the paintings of Michael Willmann, the baroque pulpit by Franz Joseph Mangoldt, the organ are destroyed by the flames. The German population was expelled after the war and replaced by Polish refugees from the east. The city takes the official name of Wroclaw and is attributed to Poland. A program of restoration of the church, of which only the walls were still standing, began in 1946. The vaults were rebuilt. A Virgin of the 16th century is offered to the church by the Catholics of Mariampol in Bessarabia, which has become Ukrainian. The interior of the church is composed of surviving elements from other destroyed churches in the city and the diocesan museum. Only the tympanum and the baptistery are original. The Warsaw artist Teresa Reklawska composed in 1968 the new modern stained glass windows depicting scenes from the New Testament.

At the time of the Disaster of Yongjia in 311, Yan Ding brought the nephew of Emperor Huai, Sima Ye, to Chang'an, where a group of loyalists from Anding (ÂÆâÂÆö, present-day Zhenyuan, Gansu) were in the process of retaking the region from Han Zhao forces. After the re-establishment of the Jin government, Yan Ding became a powerful member of the new regime but jealousy and suspicion would cut his career short as his peers Qu Yun and Suo Lin combined their forces to have him killed.  Life  Yan Ding was from Tianshui Commandary and once served the emperor's regent, Sima Yue as his Army Advisor. He managed to reach the office of Inspector of Yuzhou later in his career but had to resign due to his mother passing away. He gathered a thousand refugees in Mi County who wished to follow him back to his home but before he could leave, the emperor's nephew, Sima Ye arrived at the county. Luoyang had been captured by Han Zhao, and Emperor Huai was being held captive. Sima Ye's minister, Xun Fan established a provisional government at the county although he later moved it to Xuchang and Yingchuan to distance themselves from the enemies.(ÈñªÈºéÔºåÂ≠óÂè∞Ëá£ÔºåÂ§©Ê∞¥‰∫∫‰πü„ÄÇÂàùÁÇ∫Â§™ÂÇÖÊù±Êµ∑ÁéãË∂äÂèÉËªçÔºåËΩâÂç∑‰ª§ÔºåË°åË±´Â∑ûÂà∫Âè≤‰∫ãÔºåÂ±ØË®±Êòå„ÄÇÈÅ≠ÊØçÂñ™Ôºå‰πÉÊñºÂØÜÁ∏£ÈñìÈ≥©ËÅöË•øÂ∑ûÊµÅ‰∫∫Êï∏ÂçÉÔºåÊ¨≤ÈÇÑÈÑâÈáå„ÄÇÂÄº‰∫¨Â∏´Â§±ÂÆàÔºåÁß¶ÁéãÂá∫Â•îÂØÜ‰∏≠ÔºåÂè∏Á©∫ËçÄÁ±ì„ÄÅÁ±ìÂºüÂè∏Èö∏Ê†°Â∞âÁµÑÔºåÂèä‰∏≠È†òËªçËèØÊÅÜ„ÄÅÊ≤≥ÂçóÂ∞πËèØËñàÔºåÂú®ÂØÜÁ∏£Âª∫Á´ãË°åÂè∞Ôºå‰ª•ÂØÜËøëË≥äÔºåÂçóË∂£Ë®±ÊΩÅ„ÄÇ) Book of Jin, Volume 60 Yan Ding remained in Mi County and through the support of other ministers who had fled the capital's region, Xun Fan was persuaded to make Yan the Champion General and Inspector of Yuzhou.

With encouragement from the Prefect of Heyin (Ê≤≥Èô∞, in modern Luoyang, Henan), Fu Chang (ÂÇÖÊö¢), he began his preparations. However, ministers such as Xun Fan and Zhou Yi were against this, typically because most of them did not want to abandon their homes in the east.

Naturally, many believed this to be a bad idea as attacks from Han Zhao troops were very likely. Yan Ding ignored their concerns and set out with the emperor but encountered bandits at Shangluo along the way. Hundreds of his followers were killed while some chose to abandon the group.

In the Middle Ages, a chapel dedicated to St. Joseph stood on the site. This was destroyed at the beginning of the 17th century. After the secularization in 1810, the church was transferred to the Catholic seminary. Between 1919 and 1921 the church served the Polish minority of the town as a Catholic church. Later, the Church of St. Anne went to the Old Catholic Church. During the Second World War, the church was used to store almost half a million books from Wroc≈Çaw University Library. During the Battle of Wroc≈Çaw, the church was badly destroyed and burned out completely, along with the books. After the war, minor security measures were initially implemented. In 1970, the building went to the city's Orthodox community. It was rebuilt and could be used again in 1976 as the first orthodox church of the city.

Early life Sardjan was born in Prembun, Kebumen Regency, today in Central Java, on 4 June 1909. He studied at an AMS in Surakarta, before working as a teacher for some time. He also joined the Jong Islamieten Bond in 1926, and in 1932 the Indonesian Islamic Union Party under H. O. S. Tjokroaminoto. Career Prior to World War II, Sardjan worked as a newspaper editor in Jakarta between 1938 and 1938, and then moved to Yogyakarta where he became an editor for a different paper. After the conclusion of the war, Sardjan joined the Peasants Front of Indonesia, but he left due to conflicting ideologies - the Peasants Front was notably left-leaning. Instead, he joined the Indonesian Islamic Peasants' Union (STII), which was affiliated with the Masyumi Party. He became its chairman by 1947, and joined Masyumi upon the party's establishment. As a Masyumi member, Sardjan joined the Central Indonesian National Committee, becoming one of five Masyumi representatives in its Working Committee. He was then appointed as the Minister of Agriculture in the Wilopo Cabinet between 1952 and 1953, and later again in the Burhanuddin Harahap Cabinet between 1955 and 1956. Between those two terms, he was also appointed in 1954 into an agricultural body formed by the president, representing the STII. Sardjan's views on agriculture opposed excessive exploitation of agricultural land, often citing \\"natural balance\\". Due to the resignation of several ministers in January 1956, Sardjan briefly served as ad interim Minister of Religious Affairs. Outside of his terms as minister, Sardjan had been elected into the People's Representative Council after the 1955 Indonesian legislative election, representing East Java. He was also appointed a member of the Constitutional Assembly, and of Masyumi's executive committee since 1954. Views During his time at the Constitutional Assembly, Sardjan championed for the recognition of unalienable fundamental rights, particularly democracy. Within Masyumi, Sardjan was also a staunch defender of democracy, as opposed to factions within the party who sought a sharia government.  Death  Mohammad Sardjan died on 6 May 1992 in Jakarta, Indonesia.  Personal life  Mohammad Sardjan was married to Mustariati Sardjan. The marriage resulted in one child, named . Qadarsih would later became an actress and a singer. Mustariati Sardjan died on 12 June 1992, while Titi Qadarsih died on 22 October 2018.

It grew to prominence also in Ottoman Egypt, Turkey, and the Balkans and it is still active today. They are known for their distinctive rituals and their role in the social history of Damascus. Like many other tariqas, the Sa ødiyya is characterized by the practice of khawƒÅri·∏≥ al- øƒÅdƒÅt (deeds transcending the natural order) such as healing, spectacles involving body piercing, and dawsa (trampling), for which they are best known; the sheikh would ride a horse over his dervishes, who were lying face down making a ‚Äúliving carpet‚Äù of men. They had a wide appeal among the middle and lower classes. The founder of Sa ødiyya was Sa ød al-Dƒ´n al-ShaybƒÅnƒ´ al-JibƒÅwƒ´, who took the tariqa from the Y≈´nisƒ´ and Rifa Ωi lines, his dates remain uncertain, but he is thought to have died near JibƒÅ, a few kilometers north of Damascus in 736/1335. With time, many Damascene Sa ødƒ´s became extremely wealthy through their successful business and their big extension of the baraka they inherited. One of them was Mu·∏•ammad ibn Sa ød al-Din (d. 1020/1611), who became a sheikh in 986/1578 and amassed great wealth, and during whose time Sa ødiyya became renown. They often used this wealth to offer a safe haven of hospitality for Ottoman dignitaries at their main zawiya in the turbulent Mƒ´dƒÅn quarter. For this and other reasons, there was a lot of competitiveness among the Sa ødƒ´s over the mashaykha.  Founder  The story of Sa ød, after whom the tariqa and its members got the name, plays a symbolic role for the order. Historical details about him and his life are very scarce, and literary production by the members of the tariqa is also hard to find. Besides the aforementioned year of 736/1335 and place near Jiba for his death, which was proposed by D‚ÄôOhsson fitting with al-WƒÅsi·π≠ƒ´‚Äôs comments, there are other sources with completely different time periods and places proposed for his birth and death. According to 20th-century Sa ødƒ´ awrƒÅd, he was born in Mecca in 460/1067 and died in Jiba; al-NabhƒÅnƒ´ placed Sa ød in the Maml≈´k 8th/14th century. Y≈´nus al-ShaybƒÅnƒ´, the father of Sa ød al-Dƒ´n, is traced genealogically by the Egyptians to Idrƒ´s I. Through him and Sa ød‚Äôs mother, Sa ød is considered both ·∏§asanƒ´ and ·∏§usaynƒ´. He spoke of being from the ‚Äò‚Äôprotectors of Ka øba‚Äô‚Äô and claimed to have been the ‚Äò‚Äôsheikh of each tariqa‚Äô‚Äô as the direct murid of Muhammad. The story of meeting the Prophet is the turning point of Sa ød‚Äôs conversion as he met him, according to the story, when he was young and rebellious.  History  The Sa ødiyya is usually considered to be a Syrian branch of the RifƒÅ øiyya, especially by European sources. In al- WƒÅsi·π≠ƒ´‚Äôs work on the RifƒÅ øƒ´s, it is mentioned as khirka Sa ødiyya and in Lane‚Äôs note as a ‚Äò‚Äôcelebrated sect od the RifƒÅ øees‚Äô‚Äô, because of the similarity in practices of the two: loud dhikr, ·∏çarb al-·π£ilƒÅ·∏•, snake-charming, and ingesting live coals and glass. The two orders are also popular in the same settings. It is noteworthy that the Sa ødiyya never switched from the ShƒÅfi øƒ´ to the Ottoman ·∏§anafƒ´ madhhab.  Syria  The first Sa ødƒ´ whose existence was attested in contemporary accounts was ·∏§asan al-JibƒÅwƒ´ (d. 910 or 914). He came from Hauran to Damascus during the late Mamluk period. It was widely believed that he could cure insanity through miraculous qualities of Basmala. ·∏§asan had a son who succeeded him called ·∏§usayn (d. 926/1519). He served both the spiritually needy and the worldly rulers of Damascus with generous hospitality at the zƒÅwiya and this practice was continued by his son A·∏•mad b. ·∏§usayn (d. 963/1555) and later became a Sa ødƒ´ trademark. The Sa ødiyya were involved in clashed between the Mƒ´dƒÅn and the central authorities, and that lasted throughout the whole Ottoman era. Even though the tariqa had a localist sentiment at times, they usually displayed a strong pro-imperial stance. Some sultans even financially supported the Sa ødiyya like Ma·∏•m≈´d I,  øAbd al-Mejƒ´d and  øAbd al-·∏§amƒ´d II, who financed the renovations of the JibƒÅ Sa ødƒ´ shrine. During the Egyptian occupation (1831-9), the Sa ødi were providing a refuge for the resisting factions. An Egyptian contingent raided the zawiya to punish the Mƒ´dƒÅnƒ´s for doing that and they captured twenty men for execution or exile. Documents say that the sheikh at that time was either Khalƒ´l al-Sa ødƒ´ (d. 1264/1847) or IbrƒÅhƒ´m b. Mu·π£·π≠afƒÅ al-Sa ødƒ´ (d. 1282/1865).  Egypt  The order came to Cairo with Y≈´nus, one of nine sons of Sa ød al-Dƒ´n, according to Egyptian Sa ødƒ´ accounts. He is credit with introducing the dawsa, a ceremony which they celebrated biannually. Because of the dawsa, the Sa ødƒ´s play the main role in the story of state regulation of Egyptian tariqas. Khedive Tawfƒ´·∏≥ banned them in 1881 and the prohibition might have been a result of European rather than Muslim reformist pressure. Some people like the anthropologist and colonial official McPherson blamed secular modernism and ‚ÄúAmericanism‚Äù. With time, Sa ødƒ´s‚Äô position weakened and even though they were at the head of  øAlƒ´ al-Bakrƒ´‚Äôs convention of mashƒÅyikh in 1289/1872, they were placed last in the ranks of the official tariqas processions in 1905. In modern times, Sheikh ·∏§am≈´da al-Khu·∏çarƒ´ disallowed music in the dhikr as well as dancing and self- mutilation ‚Äúin the houses of God‚Äù. The current sheikh is  øAlƒ´ b. ·∏§am≈´da al- Khu·∏çarƒ´. He claims authority over all of the Sa ødƒ´s from the BƒÅb al-Na·π£r zƒÅwiya in Syria. The tariqa is especially popular in Upper Egypt. It is worth noting that the Cairene mashaykha was passed two times to matrilineal descendants.  Turkey  Abu ‚Äôl-WafƒÅ æ al-ShƒÅgh≈´rƒ´‚Äôs visits to Turkey in the 12th/18th century most likely represent the earliest spread of the Sa ødiyya. There are two other transmissions: by Sheikh  øAbd al-SalƒÅm (d. 1165/1751) and by Sheikh  øUthmƒÅn from Kastamonu. In 19th-century Istanbul out of 259 opportunities to attend various dhikrs every week, 26 were Sa ødi. There were 25 Sa ødi tekkes mentioned in the last official survey of Istanbul tekkes and the figure is considered to be similar for the turn of the 20th century. Ottoman state tried to institutionalize the orders in Turkey on the Mewlevƒ´ and BektƒÅshƒ´ \\"mother zƒÅwiya\\" model. In the same year, Mu·∏•ammad  øAlƒ´ gave Mu·∏•ammad al-Bakrƒ´ leadership over the Egyptian tariqas (1812) and Sultan Ma·∏•m≈´d II ordered all Sa ødƒ´ tekkes to recognize the  øAbd√ºl-SelƒÅm as their ƒÅsitƒÅne.  Balkans  The most important implantation of the order outside Syria, Egypt, and Turkey is in the Balkans and it continues to live today. There was a strong bond between the local Sa ødƒ´ leaders there and the Damascene Sa ødƒ´s, who issued khilƒÅfƒÅt-nƒÅme to the ƒÅsitƒÅnes in ƒêakovica and Prizren. Dates for the Sa ødi arrivals are uncertain, but some Sa ødƒ´ tekkes were established by the 18th century in Kosovo, Macedonia, Southern Serbia, and Belgrade. They joined eight other orders in 1947 and formed an organization different from the official Sunnƒ´ community and a similar body was founded in Albania in 1936, called ‚ÄúDivine Light‚Äù. Abu ‚Äôl-WafƒÅ æ al- ShƒÅgh≈´rƒ´ initiated the founder of the Sa ødiyya- øƒÄdjiziyya in Albania, Adjize Baba, into the order in Istanbul. Adjize Baba constructed the first Sa ødƒ´ tekke in ƒêakovica in 1111/1699.  Beliefs and Practices  Even though there are not a lot of texts documenting the belief system and the practices of the order, some of them are known to have been there since their beginning. Sa ødiyya members were known for their healing ‚Äò‚Äôpowers‚Äô‚Äô; it was believed that the Sa ødi masters could cure the insanity of people possessed by a jinn and as such, masters were thought to have been friends of God, who has given them permission and power to do so. For that reason, many believers paid visits to them in order to profit from their company. They were also known to have regularly practiced dhikr and sama and not only in their order‚Äôs quarters but also in the Umayyad mosque.  Sa ødiyya praying formulas  The small praying formula: an action of reciting in the morning and in the evening in a specific order and a certain number of times. It includes reading (Al-Fatiha, Al-Ikhlas, Al-Mu'awwidhatayn, the beginning and the end of surah Al-Baqarah with ayah Tawhid and ayah Al-Kursi), praying to Muhammad, seeking forgiveness, remembrance of God, and supplication. The middle praying formula: an action of reciting in the morning and in the evening in a specific order and a certain number of times. It includes what is said in the small praying formula, only a different number of times. The big praying formula: an action of reciting daily in a specific order and a certain number of times. It includes remembrance of God with seven of His most beautiful names, each one separately. Switch from one name to another happens only after sheikh‚Äôs signal and the number of repetitions ranges between 10,000 and 100,000. These names are: ‚ÄúThere is no god but Allah‚Äù (ŸÑÿß ÿ£ŸÑŸá ÿ•ŸÑÿß ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá), Allah (ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá), He (ŸáŸà), Living (ÿ≠Ÿä), Unique/Single (Ÿàÿßÿ≠ÿØ), Subsisting/Independent (ŸÇŸäŸàŸÖ), and Subduer/Conqueror (ŸÇŸáÿßÿ±). These three praying formulas are special, but there are many others.  Sa ødiyya and Samadiyya  Samadiyya is alongside Sa ødiyya one of the two main Sufi orders in Damascus. While the Sa ødiyya grew out of Rifa øiyya, the Samadiyya originated from Qadiriyya, one of the oldest Sufi orders in Islam. Both Qadiriyya and Rifa øiyya tariqas came from Iraq in the 6th/12th century. Once during a procession, Sa ødi Sufis were beating the drums (tubul) and their people insisted that the instrument is their symbol and must not be usurped. Samadiyya usually used the drums during their dhikr, so the two orders almost fought because of it.  Taghlibiyya  Taghlibiyya is a sub-order of Sa ødiyya and it is traced either to a son or a brother of Sa ød al-Dƒ´n.  øAbd al-·∏≤ƒÅdir al-Taghlibƒ´ (d. 1135/1722) was a great ·∏§anbalƒ´ scholar, who took fiqh lessons at the Umayyad mosque. He was noted for the dawsa and other karamat, and was known for writing amulets for the ill. Al-Taghlibƒ´ was the most famous sheikh of the Taghlibiyya order, which later got its name after him. The members also used the nisba al-ShaybƒÅni for their sub-order. Dhikr used to be held at the  øAmƒÅra home, but now a diminished dhikr takes place in a location near the Ministry of AwqƒÅf as that is where the Taghlibƒ´ house is now.  Abu l-Wafa‚Äô  Ibrahim  øAbd al-Baqi, also known as Abu l-Wafa‚Äô, was Sa‚Äôd al-Din‚Äôs descendent. He was very influential and had many admirers, disciples, and deputies in Istanbul from both the common people and the elite together with the sultan. Thanks to his two zawiyas in the Ottoman capital and in Damascus, the tariqa reached many Turks and Arabs. He was a virtuous man (salih), but at the same time unpractical and maybe even enraptured or possessed (majdhub). Even so, Ibrahim  øAbd al-Baqi was chosen as the trustee (nazir) of the awqaf of the Umayyad mosque. Having taken advantage of his negligence, the clerks controlled the mosque‚Äôs administration to their interest.

They are kept in Madrid's Royal Palace. The term \\"Palatino\\" can be translated as \\"court\\" Stradivari instruments, as it refers to their having been acquired for the royal collection. Four of the five are decorated instruments known as the Royal Quartet (also referred to in Spanish as Palatino or Coral): they comprise 2 violins, a viola and a cello. There is also another (non-decorated) cello. The Royal Quartet Decorated instruments are rare in Stradivari' output, and so are sets of instruments. A few of his clients are known to have acquired sets, for example, Ferdinando de' Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany (son of Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany). In the case of the Palatinos, Stradivari intended to present them to the king of Spain but was not able to do so during his lifetime. An ensemble of 2 violins, a viola and a cello is what is referred to in classical music as a string quartet, and works have been written for this combination by major composers. Sometimes these works are performed on Stradivari instruments, but Stradivari never heard the type of composition known as a \\"string quartet\\", the format emerged after his death. The project to provide instruments for the Spanish court evidently envisaged a different ensemble, as originally there were two violas, not one, in the set. Violas There were originally two violas of different size in the set (tenor and contralto). Both of the violas went missing at the time of the Napoleonic Wars. Only the smaller one was retrieved. =Contralto viola= The contralto viola is dated 1696. It returned to Madrid in the 20th century after having come into the possession of the dealer W.E. Hill & Sons of London. It is one of thirteen known extant violas by Stradivari. It is unusual in being decorated, although the tenor viola in Florence has decorations including the Medici crest on the fingerboard. =Tenor viola= The missing viola was larger and is believed to have been a tenor. The surviving tenor viola by Stradivari in the Musical Instruments Museum in Florence, which was part of a set belonging to the Medici court, also had a contralto pair. The role of tenors would have been to play the lower register viola lines or second viola in five-part harmony depending on instrumentation. Violins The two violins are of different sizes. They have labels bearing a date of 1709. This dating is accepted by some authorities, although it has been suggested that the instruments are slightly older. Cello The cello is not in its original playing condition, but is reported to be in a good state of conservation after the repair of damage sustained during a photographic session. Conservation The instruments are in the care of the Spanish heritage organisation Patrimonio Nacional, which allows them to be played on occasion.

Formerly the Main Library, it is a Grade II* listed building opened in 1959 by Nobel prize- winning poet T. S. Eliot. The library was designed and built as a result of a national competition announced by the university in 1953. It was the university's main library until the Information Commons was opened in April 2007. Western Bank Library is linked to the Arts Tower (opened later in 1966) via a bridge between their mezzanine floors. The two buildings are intended to be viewed together according to their architect Gollins Melvin Ward.Harman, R. & Minnis, J. (2004) Pevsner City Guides: Sheffield, pp82-84\\\\. New Haven & London: Yale University Press. The library has 730 study spaces. It is accessed by the ground floor entrance or via entrances on the mezzanine level. History T. S. Eliot opened the Western Bank Library in 1959 With the growth of student numbers at the University of Sheffield following the Second World War, the old university library, Edgar Allen Library in Firth Court, was necessary to be replaced with a modern post-war era one. In 1953, the university held an innovative national competition for a new master plan for the Western Bank Campus, where entrants were required to design a new library capable of holding one million volumes. There were a total of 99 entries to the competition. An emerging London-based architectural practice Gollins Melvin Ward and Partners won with their design that sought a simple clean architecture with wide basic spans. Its cubic form was inspired by pioneer of modernist architecture Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and was an attempt to unify the university campus despite the stark contrast between the pre-and post-war buildings. On 12 May 1959, American-born British poet T. S. Eliot performed the opening ceremony of the Main Library. A higher degree ceremony was also conducted on that day within the reading room of the library, during which honorary degrees were awarded to Eliot and other notables including Stanley Peyton. In 1993, the Main Library acquired Grade II* listed status, along with the adjacent Arts Tower. The University of Sheffield continued to expand in the 1990s, causing a shortage of study spaces for students within the university. The Main Library was however not easily extendable, and the spatial separation of library and IT services in the library was difficult to accommodate. A new library and computing center, Information Commons, was hence opened in 2007 to help to relieve pressure on the Main Library. This 1959 library was renamed Western Bank Library on 1 September 2007. In February 2010, the building was refurbished by Avanti Architects, restoring the previously obscured marble walls to its original form, and providing group study rooms and new study spaces. Architecture Western Bank Library is built in post-war modernism style. The building is resolutely rectangular, with an exterior of stone facings and plate glass. Its interior is constructed of reinforced concrete and steel, with marble stairways. It has large glass curtain walls run through the length of its reading room, offering views north across Weston Park's lake and grounds. Western Bank Library was described as \\"the best modern building in Sheffield\\" by architecture historian Nikolaus Pevsner. The library has a marble-walled Exhibition Gallery on the mezzanine level. The gallery was formally opened in 2010 after restoration with a grant of ¬£184,000 from the Wolfson Foundation and other alumni foundation gifts. The Exhibition Gallery is open to the public during the library's opening hours. It displays items from the university's special collections and archive, as well as hosts visiting exhibitions. Past exhibitions include works and objects by showman P. T. Barnum, architect George Devey, artist Annie Bindon Carter, author Barry Hines and Sheffield's Nobel laureate Hans Krebs. The gallery also showcased the Department of Music's collection of historical musical instruments, and the university's fine press books. Holdings The library holds 1.2 million texts for most subjects as well as 25,000 rare books and 150 special collections. It is also home to the university's Special Collections and the National Fairground and Circus Archive.

The name and trademark were derived directly from the name of the manufacturer: Wytwornia Sprzetu Komunikacyjnego (). History In 1955 Wytw√≥rnia Sprzƒôtu Komunikacyjnego was asked to produce the 125 cc WFM M06 motorcycles as WFM were unable to meet market demands. Except for the tank badge the WSK and WFM models were identical. The WSK engineers started work on an improved model. The new machine had a new engine, the S-017, a new frame made of welded from closed rectangular sections and telescopic forks. This went into production in 1959 as the M06Z and a lower specification model, the M06L was also introduced. Derivatives of this model continued to be produced until motorcycle production ceased in 1985. A 150 cc motorcycle was produced in 1960 by fitting a WFM S06 engine in the M06Z. The model, 150Z, was only produced that year. In 1972 a 175 cc model was introduced, the M21 W2. Derivatives of this model were produced until the factory closed. The factory was closed in October 1985, by which time around 2,000,000 motorcycles has been produced, 1,700,000 of which were in the 125 cc class. Competition machines The factory produced a limited number of 125 and 175 cc road racers. The company also produced the WSK FIS speedway bike from 1955-1959. The engine used in these machines was a copy of the British JAP speedway engine. Museum On 13 May 2010, the first museum dedicated to this brand of motorcycles was opened in ≈öwidnik.

He studied music under Felix Draeseke and became the first director of the \\"Felix-Draeseke-Gesellschaft\\". After several positions as choir and orchestra conductor, he settled in Eisleben in 1906 as organist and church music director. In 1921, he was appointed first professor of musicology at the University of Marburg. He habilitated there on 12 November 1921 and held his inaugural lecture the same day.

Cardi B has referred to her as \\"a second mom.\\" Bui's design for Cardi B's 2018 Grammy appearance \\"helped bring bling back into the mainstream\\" according to Christina Parella writing for NYCGo. Bui's designs have become a part of Cardi B's signature look and were featured in a 2019 Superbowl commercial the rapper appeared in. Other fashion and beauty influencers also contributed to Bui's increasing prominence. Bui has a partnership with Swarovski and her own line of nail polish, Jenny Secret. As of 2020 Bui has two salons, Jenny's Spa in the Bronx's Fordham neighborhood and Nails on 7th in Harlem, and 20 employees.

Issues arose from some potential members, namely Harvard, and instead of a forma league a loose association was formed in order to discuss issues, settle arguments and facilitate scheduling. After Talbot Hunter's sudden departure from the team the program brought in former player Francis Bangs as coach. Unfortunately, the team was still having to use the Philadelphia Ice Palace as its home arena since the temporary rinks that were built on the Whitney Avenue tennis courts proved insufficient. After opening up with two losses before Christmas, Yale headed to Pittsburgh to face Carnegie Tech for the first time in over a decade. The Tartans had just brought their program back and were hardly a match for the experienced Bulldogs but the Tartans showed promise. Yale won a third consecutive game against another program that returned after several years away (Columbia) but when they faced stiffer competition, the Elis were unable to raise their game. In their final five game of the season, Yale managed only 3 goals and surrendered 28. Their best performance came against Dartmouth when the two teams played a scoreless contest although the game was called due to poor ice conditions.

As the organ of the Zionist Federation of Germany it represented German Zionism to the outside world. Significant debates about the function and task of Jewish politics in the sense of the Basel program that were held at the first Zionist congress in 1897 were presented on their pages.Alfried Schmitz: Vor 120 Jahren: Der erste zionistische Weltkongress in Basel Deutschlandfunk, 29.

The magazine emerged from the Berliner Vereinsbote (1895‚Äì1901) and the Israelitische Rundschau (1901‚Äì1902). It was published by Heinrich Loewe. The editors- in- chief throughout the history of the magazine have included Julius Becker, Felix Abraham, Hugo Hermann, Leo Hermann, Fritz L√∂wenstein, Hans Kl√∂tzel, Robert Weltsch and Hans Bloch. The J√ºdische Rundschau was initially published weekly from 1902, and mostly twice a week from 1919. After the Reichspogromnacht in 1938, the magazine had to stop its publication. The successor was the J√ºdische Welt-Rundschau, which was printed in Paris and from there distributed to 60 countries, until the German Wehrmacht marched in in 1940. It was designed in Jerusalem by numerous emigrated members of the editorial team of the former J√ºdische Rundschau and published by Siegmund Kaznelson. The co-editor Robert Weltsch was one of the most influential and important journalists of the J√ºdische Rundschau. His cousin Felix Weltsch, a close friend of Franz Kafka, published the Czechoslovak central organ of the Zionists, the German language Self - Defense (1907‚Äì1938), in Prague from 1919.

AAUP was founded in the year 2000 and it provides BA, MA and PhD degree programs. The main campus is located near Talfit at the south of Jenin Governorate, and the other campus is located in AlReehan area in Ramallah and AlBireh Governorate. AAUP has also gained memberships in: the Association of Arab Universities, the Federation of Islamic Universities and the Association of Private Universities.  History  The idea of Arab American University started in 1996 in a discussion between some Palestinian businessmen. Among them was Dr. Yousef Asfour who is currently the Head of the Board of Directors of the university. Jenin governorate was chosen to be the place for the main campus of AAUP since the northern part of the West Bank was missing a higher educational institution and especially because Jenin is located near the Arab cities and villages of the green line territories. And so, Arab American University was opened on September 28, 2000 with a capital of 12 million $, with few students and one building which contained four faculties of which: the Faculty of Dentistry, the Faculty of Sciences, the Faculty of Allied Medical Sciences and the Faculty of Administrative and Financial Sciences. The academic programs in AAUP started under collaboration with California State University (CSU) in Stanislaus that helped in the curriculum, and Utah State University (USU) in Logan that provided faculty members and staff during the first years. In 2017, AAUP opened the second campus in Ramallah and AlBireh governorate. And currently, AAUP provides over 40 programs in BA, High Diploma, MA, and PhD degrees.

History  The origin of the term \\"balance of performance\\" dates back to the creation of Group GT3 in 2005 for the 2006 racing season, using experience learned from homologation special phenomenon in previous GT classes, although other series such as British Touring Car Championship and Japanese Super GT series had applied similar concept in the past (and still in effect today) called success ballast, which only affected the weight of a competing car for each round. (Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters also previously featured a success ballast system named as BoP between 2015 to 2017 until it was scrapped with two races left in the 2017 season). The aim of the system is to allow development of various racing models within a class, without leading to expensive development wars between manufacturers. The system was later adopted for other production-based racing classes such as Group GT4, LM GTE and TCR Touring Cars. Although one-make, open-wheel and prototype car racing typically do not use a BoP system, a similar system was devised for LMP1 class in FIA World Endurance Championship called equivalence of technology (abbreviated EoT), that allows for parity between hybrid and non-hybrid cars in the class. Additionally, DPi cars in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship are subject to balance of performance as well.  Mechanism  Balance of performance is assigned by testing and analysis of a certain model's performance through previous races, although alternate methods may be used if the competing vehicle is new. For example, for GT3 cars, SRO holds two BoP tests a year at Circuit Paul Ricard, with cars driven by professional racing drivers who would have driven the car, to assess the performance of, and thus assign the BoP, of each car. These cars are equipped with a organizer-supplied telemetry device so that the organizer can gather data to allow the balancing of the cars, with new-to-class cars also subject to wind tunnel and dynometer testing. Once the results are obtained, various aspects of the car that can affect the car's performance such as engine horsepower, vehicle weight, aerodynamics, are then adjusted. By analyzing performance patterns of each car, organizers can change BoP of a car at any point during the season. Different series or organizers may calculate BoP differently depending on the conditions, with IMSA and ACO applying different BoP calculation for LM GTE cars in their respective series, while BoP for GT3 cars participating in Super GT's GT300 class are optimized to allow competition against cars built exclusively for the series, and TCR has a unique feature called compensation weight, as a further mechanism to balance the cars. Some manufacturers have been accused of sandbagging, where a car would purposely underperform during a test, or during certain races, to receive favorable results later; for example, rival teams accused the Ford GT (run by Chip Ganassi Racing) of sandbagging during the 2016 FIA World Endurance Championship season, even after performance adjustments after the qualifying for 2016 24 Hours of Le Mans. Various rules have been made to deter this; for example, IMSA mandated any car that is found to be sandbagging during the Roar Before the 24 (a testing session leading to the 24 Hours of Daytona race) at their discretion to serve a five-minute stop and go penalty starting from 2014 season if a team is caught sandbagging during the sessions (penalties are served differently if the sandbagging was discovered after the end of the sessions), although instances of sandbagging were still found as of 2019 race. Several racing games, such as Gran Turismo Sport and Assetto Corsa Competizione, also features a simulated balance of performance for each playable car as part of the games' game balance mechanism.

He is known for his writings about Ludwig van Beethoven, publishing the composer's first major biography as a translation of Alexander Wheelock Thayer's work.  Life and career  Deiters was born in Bonn on 27 June 1833. He was the son of the Bonn lawyer and politician Peter Franz Ignaz Deiters.Willi Kahl: Deiters, Hermann Clemens Otto Deutsche Biographie 1957 His father, and all his siblings, belonged to the Catholic Church, while his mother Emilie n√©e Bausch was Protestant. From 1842 onwards, Deiters and his younger brother Otto attended the , which was then headed by Ludwig Schopen. After his Abitur (25 July 1850), he first studied classical philology and history at the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t Bonn. After one semester, he switched to law because of his father's wish and completed his studies with a doctorate in law in 1854. During his studies, he became a member of the in 1853. His first position (in winter 1854/55 as an auscultator at the Berlin city court) did not satisfy him, so he returned to Bonn and resumed his studies of philology. He attended lectures by Christian August Brandis, Heinrich Brunn, Franz Ritter, and Ludwig Schopen, but he was most influenced by the directors of the philological seminar, Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker, Friedrich Ritschl, and Otto Jahn, of which Deiters was a member for three semesters. In accordance with his inclination and versatile talents, he joined Jahn in particular, who represented broad areas of antiquity studies and was also known as a musician and musicologist. Deiters received his doctorate on 28 July 1858 with a dissertation on Hesiod's Aspis. On 6 November 1858, he passed the habilitation for secondary school teachers and began his probationary year at the Gymnasium in Bonn, where he subsequently taught as an assistant teacher, and from 1 July 1862 as a full-time teacher. On 1 January 1869, he changed to the Gymnasium in D√ºren as senior teacher. In 1874, he moved to West Prussia as headmaster of the . On 1 January 1877, he transferred to the Mariengymnasium in Posen. As headmaster, Deiters endeavoured to provide his school with material and personnel. He laid down technical, methodological-didactic, and pedagogical principles, as he was used to them from Bonn, and set up student libraries and collections of teaching materials. Finally, he returned to Bonn, where he was appointed head of the K√∂nigliches Gymnasium on 1 October 1883. He became Provinzialschulrat in Koblenz in 1885, responsible for teacher training and school equipment in the Rhine Province. Deiters carried out his duties with great commitment and considerable success, and received several awards: in 1891 he was appointed Geheimrat, and later he received the Order of the Crown and the Order of the Red Eagle, 2nd Class. For health reasons, Deiters retired on 1 October 1903, and he died in Koblenz on 11 May 1907 at the age of 73. Deiters was married first to Agnes Burkart, who died in 1884, and from 1886 to Sibylla Heimsoeth, the daughter of the philologist and musicologist . The two marriages produced seven children.  Academic work  In addition to his work in the Prussian teaching profession, Deiters was engaged in scientific work. His early works dealt with topics of Greek mythology, especially the cult of Muses. However, the main focus of his research became the music itself, which Deiters had been involved with since his childhood. He abandoned his plan to become a composer or pianist before he began his studies, but the history, development and practice of music occupied him throughout his life. At the beginning of his career, Deiters wrote music reviews and reports for various newspapers and magazines, including the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung. He venerated Mozart, Beethoven, and Schumann, and of contemporary composers especially Johannes Brahms, who was his close friend from the 1860s. He rigorously rejected Wagner and his massive innovations in musical practice. After the death of his teacher Otto Jahn, he revised his biography of Mozart, which was published in third and fourth editions in 1889 and 1905 respectively. He also corresponded with the American researcher Alexander Wheelock Thayer, who was working on a major Beethoven biography. Deiters translated the work into German and accompanied the publication of the first three volumes (1866, 1872, 1879). The German edition of this biography was particularly important because the English original had not yet been published. After Thayer's death (1897), his heirs commissioned Deiters to publish the rest of the work.

Although this period of germination is very limited the impact of microbial activity can have strong and long-lasting effects on the developing plant. Numerous molecules exudate from seeds and influence the microbial communities present, either by inhibition or stimulation of their growth. The composition of the exudates varies according to the plant type, and qualities of the soil such as its pH and moisture content.

After her death, Tishyarakshita became the chief queen of Ashoka. Karmic legends The Mahavamsa tells a legend of how she became queen, stating that she became Ashoka's queen because in a previous life, she had given directions to a pratyekabuddha who was looking for a honey merchant. The story says that after the merchant filled his bowl completely with honey, the pratyekabuddha made a vow to become the lord of Jambudvipa. After hearing this, she herself wished they would be reborn as King and Queen, leading them to be reborn as Ashoka and Asandhimitra. In the Extended Mahavamsa, a story is additionally told that in a separate past life, Asandhimitra gave a pratyekabuddha a piece of cloth, which is thought to have given her the status of Queen, karmically independent of Asoka. In the Dasavatthuppakarana, it combines both stories into one, telling the story of the pratyekabuddha and the honey merchant and adding that Asandhimitra's past self gifted the same pratyekabuddha with a piece of cloth.

He is best known for his magnum opus, Die Geschichte der deutschen St√§mme bis zum Ausgang der V√∂lkerwanderung (1904-1918), which up to the present day remains the standard reference work on the history of the Germanic peoples in the Migration Period. Biography Ludwig Schmidt was born in Dresden, Germany on 18 July 1862. He studied history at Leipzig University from 1881 to 1884, during which he developed an interest in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. Wilhelm Arndt and Heinrich Bernhard Christian Brandes were among his professors. His 1884 dissertion was on the history of the Lombards. After his graduation, Schmidt was employed by the Saxon State and University Library Dresden, where he was appointed Senior Librarian in 1919 and Deputy Director in 1921. He received the title of Professor in 1907, was soon afterwards made Corresponding Member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences and Full Member of the Saxon Academy of Sciences and Humanities. Schmidt received the Knight's Cross 1st Class of the Albert Order in 1910. He retired on 31 December 1925. Research Ludwig Schmidt specialized in the history of the Germanic peoples during the Migration Period. His magnum opus, Die Geschichte der deutschen St√§mme bis zum Ausgang der V√∂lkerwanderung, was published in 1904-1918. It has since been revised and republished in numerous editions. In the second edition published in 1934, which disagrees with Nazi theories, Schmidt spoke out against the politicization of history by the Nazi authorities. Schmidt's book is based almost entirely on primary sources, on which Schmidt had gained a complete overview during his time as a university librarian. From the early 20th century up to modern times, his book has been a essential resource for historians on the history of the Germanic peoples during the Migration Period.. \\"So bleibt die ‚ÄûGeschichte der deutschen St√§mme‚Äú zumindest als Stoffslg. unentbehrlich.\\"; . \\"Wegen ihrer Materialf√ºlle ist diese Publikation noch heute unentbehrlich.\\"; . \\"[E]ven today one cannot study the Goths or any other late antique barbarians without reference to the revised second edition of Ludwig Schmidt‚Äôs Geschichte der deutschen Stamme (‚ÄòHistory of the German Tribes‚Äô)...\\"; . \\"The Goths are not, of course, a neglected subject.

It is found in shallow waters in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. This species was first described in 1935 by the British zoologist Maurice Burton. He placed it in a new genus because of its unusual spicules, and named it Rhaphidostyla kitchingi, in honour of Dr J. A. Kitching, who had collected the original specimen. It was later transferred to the genus Hymeniacidon. Description Hymeniacidon kitchingi is a small species forming cushions not exceeding in volume. The shape is very variable, with irregular lobes and various short, thin projections and more bulbous projections. Several ducts converge into each oscula; these exhalant openings are raised slightly above the surface and have transparent margins, but they are relatively inconspicuous. The surface of this sponge may be slightly rough, the texture is soft and compressible but porous, and the tissue crumbles easily. The general colour is grey or beige, sometimes tinged with pink or purple. The skeleton contains long, slender styles, megascleres with one end pointed and the other end rounded; the blunt end of each has a series of abrupt narrowings which gives a stepped effect. Some of these megascleres are scattered throughout the mesogloea while others are formed into wispy bundles supporting the surface of the sponge. Hymeniacidon kitchingi could be confused with Halichondria bowerbanki, but that species has longer, more slender lobes and a different range of spicules. Another similar species is Haliclona viscosa, but in that species, the oscula are on the ends of conical projections and are more noticeable. Distribution and habitat Hymeniacidon kitchingi is native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, where its range extends from Scotland southwards to Finist√®re in northern France, and includes the western parts of the English Channel. It has also been reported from the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea. It grows on rocks in the littoral zone and shallow sub-littoral zone, as well as on the holdfasts and stipes of kelp such as Saccharina latissima. It prefers areas where there is strong wave action. It also occurs as an epiphyte of large seaweeds and an epibiont of the bryozoans Cellaria and Pentapora. Ecology Sponges draw water in through small pores, filter out the organic particles less than 2Œºm in diameter, and expel the water and any larger particles through the oscula. The diet of Hymeniacidon kitchingi is mainly bacteria, unicellular algae, and organic debris. It has been calculated that a sponge can filter of water per day. The sponge is a hermaphrodite. After fertilisation, the embryos are brooded inside the sponge, and when they reach the last embryonic stage, they pass out through the oscula into the water column. They drift with the plankton, and after a few hours, settle on the seabed, attach themselves to the substrate and become juvenile sponges. The sponge can also reproduce asexually by budding, and like all sponges, it has great powers of regeneration.

He signed his works as L. Bru-Net or Bru-Net.  Life  Brunet was born in Badalona on 14 September 1872, son of the primary teacher Josep Brunet i Bassachs, native from the same town, and Joana Forroll i Codina, from Tiana. During his childhood showed interest in drawing and painting and had contact with Antoni Caba, a prestigious painter and former director from Barcelona Arts and Crafts School who was also a friend of his father, to whom he promised to protect and help Lloren√ß study art. Some years later he started his studies at Arts and Crafts School. His teachers were the artists Claudi Lorenzale, Eusebi Planas and the aforementioned Caba. Brunet also had great admiration for Claudi Castelucho. Brunet won awards at some contests, in 1891 his teacher Eusebi Planas recommended him going to Paris, where he learned with the lithographer Mercier. In France he started raising money because of the precarious situation of his parents, to whom he sent money periodically, however he had to abandon temporarily his studies. Short after this, he returned to studies and he stayed in Oran and Algiers for some time practising painting and drawing and also worked as an illustrator for important French and Spanish publishing houses. There he became interested of applied art of printing books and graphical work in general, field where he ended up standing out. When he was 20 and was staying in Algiers won an extraordinary award for composition and historical theme with the large oil painting named Entrega de las llaves de Or√°n al cardenal Cisneros, which was later ceded to Badalona City Council. The next year he was sent to military service, to the body of engineers in Madrid where he likewise practised his artistic technique. From that period are drawings as La marcha del quinto and Mi capit√°n (1895). When he returned to Catalonia, he settled in Barcelona and married Consolaci√≥ Salada, with whom had two daughters, Julieta and Maria Teresa. In 1910 the statal Junta de Pensions para Ampliar Estudios, chaired by Santiago Ramon y Cajal, gave him a scholarship to study in Germany. He lived in Leipzig until some time before the start of World War I, where he get fond for bookplates. Since then Brunet felt great sympathy for the Germans, his friends and family considered him a Germanophile. When he returned to Barcelona was appointed teacher of drawing and colour in the section of artistic craft of the local School of Work. The arrival of the Second Spanish Republic, the new authorities removed him in 1931, a fact that upset and demoralized him. Brunet has been considered an apolitical personal and his only interest was art. It is probable that his cessation was simply because he had been appointed during the monarchical period. He tried to fight what he belevied to be an injustice and asked help to his fried Apel¬∑les Mestres to intercede for him. However, a few years later he was appointed professor at the Secondary School in Sant Feliu de Gu√≠xols, a position he held for very little time and eventually resigned. The Spanish Civil War meant worries and concerns for him. His house located in Balmes street was registered several times. In spite of this he continued to go to social circles at the cafes in the Rambla. A short time after his daughter Maria Teresa got sick and Brunet himself, affected for this, became ill and had to be admitted at the hospital. On 28 September 1938 his daughter died and the next year Brunet died too, on 12 October 1939.  Work  Brunat was a very prolific artist, working especially on bookplates, drawings, caricatures and posters, as well as watercolors, with which he participated several times in exhibitions in Barcelona in years 1911, 1918, 1919 and 1921. His work was awarded in various exhibitions and competitions, both in Spain and internationally. These distinctions made him deserve to be a member of the Spanish committee of the Rivoli International Exhibition. Important publishers, magazines and art books asked for his works to illustrate his works. In Catalonia and Spain Brunet collaborated with newspapers as L'Esquella de la Torratxa, La Campana de Gr√†cia, La Campana Catalana, El Diluvio Ilustrado, Palla Nova, Cu-Cut!, Domingu√≠n and ABC. He signed his works as L. Bru-Net or only Bru-Net. He published two collections of pen drawings: Caps de casa (1922) and Testes de la terra-Catalunya (1929), a collection of types from various Catalan regions. Brunet was fond of drawing landscapes, as a good connoisseur of the mountains around Badalona, especially La Conreria, he made drawings of the views of the mountains and their monuments, such as the Carthusian monastery of Montalegre (Tiana). Some of his drawings were published in 1889 in the magazine La Ilustraci√≥n Ib√©rica. It also illustrated the book about the monastery of Montalegre in 1921 written by Pedro Cano Barranco. Art critic N√∫√±ez de Prado wrote about Brunet: ‚ÄúHe is superb and human at a time. He possesses the humor of the English and the intention of the Germans. Sometimes wanting to scratch, tear, perhaps remembering what his father suffered and the little protection of the governments of those times, despite the already high personalities have admired him and begged him to send and acquire his excellent original drawings, as did his great admirers and protectors, Segismundo Moret, Nicol√°s Salmer√≥n, the King of Saxony, the Prince of W√ºttemberg, Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal, Dato, Bascar√°n, Maura and Berm√∫dez Reina. ‚Äù Since his death, his work soon was forgotten, despite his remarkable artistic quality. At the end of 2018, the Museum of Badalona dedicated an exhibition to him, giving special importance to his drawings of the World War I.  Collectionism  For many years Brunet became interested and collected many artistic works and antiquities from Catalonia. Brunet gathered them in a house which he called Cau Brunet, located in Col√≤nia Bosc de la Coreria, a summer residential area in Sant Fost de Campsentelles. His intention was to turn the house into a museum. The land on which he had built the house had probably been given to him by the promoters of the area, Francesc Artigues and Gon√ßal Arn√∫s, who were interested in the founding of a museum in the colony and convert it in a meeting point for hikers. Brunet turned the house into that museum in 1914 and asked collaboration to Badalona City Council, that seconded the proposal. On October 16 of that year, the mayor Josep Casas wrote him thanking for his work.

Charlie Stripling began composng his own syncopated tunes or \\"ragtime breakdowns\\", often based on current pop songs, playing them at square dances in mining towns and elsewhere. In 1929, the brothers traveled to Chicago where they recorded ten further tunes for Vocalion, including two vocal recordings, \\"Weeping Willow\\" and \\"Railroad Bum\\".

Biography by Burgin Mathews, Allmusic.com. Retrieved > 30 August 2020 Charlie Stripling's wife died in 1934; he remarried, but his growing family, with nine children in all, meant that he could not afford time away from his farm. Similarly, Ira could no longer afford to pay for an employee to cover his absences from work. Their recording career ended, though Charlie continued to play locally, \`often accompanied by two of his sons, Robert Clifton Stripling and Lee Edwin Stripling. After his sons left during World War II, Charlie Stripling formed a band that played for large dances in the region. His health began to fail in the 1950s, and he died in 1966, aged 69. Ira Stripling died the following year, aged 68. In 1971, a collection of the Stripling Brothers' recordings was issued by County Records.

In a track career which lasted from January 2007 until October 2016 he contested 104 races, winning 13 times and being placed on 27 occasions. He won three minor races as a three-year-old in 2007 and improved in the following year to win the Buckingham Palace Stakes and the Ayr Gold Cup. In the next two years he showed top class form over sprint distances, taking the City Plate and Haydock Sprint Cup in 2009 and the Hackwood Stakes and Prix Maurice de Gheest in 2010. He remained in training until the age of twelve but never returned to the highest class and won only three minor races before being retired from racing, Background Regal Parade is a chestnut horse with a narrow white blaze bred in England by the Hampshire-based Highclere Stud and Harry Herbert. As a yearling in October 2015 the colt was put up for auction at Tattersalls and was bought for 430,000 guineas by John Ferguson Bloodstock on behalf of Sheikh Mohammed. He was sent into training with Mark Johnston at Middleham Moor, North Yorkshire. Regal Parade was gelded before he began his racing career. His sire Pivotal was a top class sprinter who won the King's Stand Stakes and the Nunthorpe Stakes in 1996. He went on to become an \\"excellent\\" sire, getting the winners of more than a thousand races across a range of distances including Sariska, Somnus, Farhh, Kyllachy and Immortal Verse. Regal Parade's dam Model Queen showed modest racing ability, winning one minor race from eight attempts. As a granddaughter of the broodmare Mofida (foaled 1974), she was closely related to many good winners including Zafonic, Midday, Elmaamul and Reams of Verse. Racing career=2007: three-year-old season Regal Parade did not race until he was three years old but he made an immediate impact. He won a maiden race over seven furlongs on the synthetic Polytrack surface at Wolverhampton Racecourse in January and followed up a month later by taking a handicap over the same distance at Southwell Racecourse. He was switched to the turf on 6 May for a handicap at Newmarket Racecourse in which he was ridden by Kevin Darley and started at odds of 4/1. Carrying 123 pounds he completed his hat-trick as he took the lead a furlong out and won by two lengths from the filly Miss Lucifer. The gelding sustained his first defeat later that month when he came home seventh in a handicap at Haydock Park. He failed to win again in 2007, finishing no better that fourth in seven subsequent races. At the end of October he returned to the Tattersalls sales ring and was bought for 16,000 guineas by the trainer David Nicholls. The gelding was taken into training by Nicholls at Sessay and entered the ownership of Dab Hand Racing. 2008: four-year-old season In 2008 Regal Parade failed to win in his first five races but finished second on three occasions. He was then sent to Royal Ascot on 20 June to contest the Buckingham Palace Stakes, a seven furlong handicap and went off at odds of 25/1 in a 28-runner field. Ridden by the apprentice jockey Ahmed Ajtebi he took the lead a furlong from the finish and won by half a length from the six- year-old Dhaular Dhar. Regal Parade ran third in the Bunbury Cup at Newmarket and was unplaced in a valuable handicap at Goodwood before being off the course for seven weeks. The apprentice William Carson rode him when he returned on 20 September for the Ayr Gold Cup over six furlongs (a distance over which he had never previously run) on heavy ground in which he carried a weight of 122 pounds and started at odds of 18/1 in a 27-runner field. After being restrained in the early stages he made strong progress in the last quarter mile, went to the front a furlong out and came home two and a quarter lengths clear of his rivals. Nicholls commented \\"One of the owners booked William. I had never seen him before we met in the parade ring, and I told him to ride the horse with plenty of confidence and he gave him a great ride\\" while Carson said \\"My grandfather never won the Ayr Gold Cup but he finished second once and he thought he had won!\\" On his only other start of the year Regal Parade was stepped up in class for the Group 3 Bengough Stakes at Ascot in October and finished fourth. 2009: five-year-old season On 28 March Regal Parade began his 2009 campaign by running sixth in a minor race at Kempton and then finished second to Asset when favourite for the Leicestershire Stakes four weeks later. At York Racecourse on 30 May the gelding was ridden by Adrian Nicholls (the son of his trainer) when he started the 13/2 fourth choice in the betting for a minor event over seven furlongs. In a tightly contested finish the gelding gained the advantage in the closing stages and won by a neck and a head from Mia's Boy and Court Masterpiece. In June he contested his first Group 1 race and came home ninth behind Art Connoisseur in the Golden Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot. On 11 July, with Nicholls again in the saddle, he started 11/4 second favourite for the Listed City Plate over seven furlongs at Chester Racecourse. After tracking the leaders he took the lead inside the final furlong and held on under pressure to win by half a length from the favoured Balthazaar's Gift. In his next two races Regal Parade finished third to Finjaan in the Lennox Stakes at Goodwood and second to Balthazaar's Gift in the Hungerford Stakes at Newbury. On 5 September the gelding started at odds of 14/1 for the Group 1 Haydock Sprint Cup in which he was again ridden by Nicholls. Fleeting Spirit started favourite while the other twelve runners included Finjaan, Asset, Art Connoisseur, High Standing (Wokingham Stakes), Main Aim (John of Gaunt Stakes), Equiano, Bushranger and the South African challenger J J The Jet Plane. After being restrained in the early stages he was switched left in the last quarter mile, overtook Fleeting Spirit 100 yards from the finish and won by half a length. Adrian Nicholls commented \\"I would have preferred to be a bit handier as the race was developing, but they went a good gallop. Ideally, I wanted to follow Fleeting Spirit, but I got taken back a place or two. At halfway, I gave him a little dig and he has come good. I thought I would keep it uncomplicated. I switched him out and once I did I was confident I was going to get the filly. All credit to Dad ‚Äì I just do the pointing and the steering\\". 2010: six-year-old season In March 2010 Regal Parade was sent to the United Arab Emirates to contest the Dubai Golden Shaheen at Meydan Racecourse in which he finished last of the ten runners behind Kinsale King. On his return to Europe he ran unplaced behind Starspangledbanner in the Golden Jubilee Stakes. In the Hackwood Stakes at Newbury on 17 July the gelding started at odds of 15/2 in a field of nine. He raced towards the rear of the field before making rapid progress on the outside to gain the advantage in the last quarter mile and drew away in the closing stages to win by three lengths from High Standing. Regal Parade was sent to France for the Group 1 Prix Maurice de Gheest over 1300 metres at Deauville Racecourse on 8 August and started the 5/1 second favourite behind the Prix de la For√™t winner Varenar. The other thirteen runners included Joanna (Prix de Sandringham), War Artist (Prix de Ris-Orangis), Alverta (Coolmore Classic), Planet Five (Prix du Gros Ch√™ne), High Standing, Arabian Gleam (Challenge Stakes) and Prime Defender (Duke of York Stakes). Ridden by Nicholls, he raced in mid-division before making good progress to move into contention just after half way. He took the lead 300 metres from the finish and kept on well in the closing stages to win by a neck from Joanna with the pair finishing four lengths clear of High Standing in third place. After the race, Adrian Nicholls said Nicholls jnr said: \\"He's an ex-Mark Johnston horse and everyone knows how tough his horses are ‚Äì and this horse is no different. The filly (Joanna) travelled really well and I wanted to try and get cover behind her if possible as it was a really rough race down on the inside... I was a bit worried passing the furlong marker but my fellow has such a big heart and gave it his all at the finish.\\" In his two subsequent starts of 2010 Regal Parade finished sixth to Markab when attempting to repeat his 2009 success in the Haydock Sprint Cup and then ran a close fourth behind Goldikova, Paco Boy and Dick Turpin in the Prix de la For√™t at Longchamp Racecourse on 3 October. Later career: 2011‚Äì2016 In 2011 Regal Parade failed to win in eight races, although he was placed in the Duke of York Stakes, John of Gaunt Stakes and Chipchase Stakes. In the following year he moved to the stable of Milton Bradley at Sedbury. He was beaten in his first fourteen races before snapping his two- year losing streak when he won a valuable handicap over six furlongs at York in October. In 2013 he ran thirteen times, recording his only success in May when he won a minor race over six furlongs at Haydock. In the following year he ran ten times and won once, taking a handicap race at Newmarket in August. Before the start of the 2015 season Regal Parade was acquired by Roalco & J Goddard and was moved to the stable of Charlie Wallis at Ardleigh. He raced eleven times that year, and failed to win although he was placed five times. As a twelve-year-old in 2016 he failed to win in eleven starts, ending his track career by running sixth in a minor handicap race at Yarmouth Racecourse on 18 October.

The day after the death of Adriaan van Kervel, the Council of Policy at the Cape met for the purpose of electing an acting head. Van den Henghel and the secunde, Hendrik Swellengrebel, made themselves available for the position. Van den Henghel, claimed the appointment, on the ground that he had been a senior merchant longer than Swellengrebel and had been in the colony since 1731. As the council reached a stalemate with the election it was decided to determine the appointment by drawing lots, with the result going in favour of Van den Henghel. When the Lords XVII (Heren XVII) received report of the arrangements made at the Cape for carrying on the government, they expressed their disapproval, because they considered the secunde the proper person to assume authority upon the death of a governor.

Following this literary debut, he began contributing poems, reviews and translations to both The London Magazine and The Scots Magazine. Among the translations were more from the Latin, in this case of poems by the Polish-born Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski.Casimir Britannicus: English Translations, Paraphrases, and Emulations of the Poetry of Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski, MHRA 2010, p.203 His final appearances in The London Magazine were a review and a poem in its volume 20 in 1751. However, two more translations by Dinsdale were published the following year. The first, Parmenides Prince of Macedonia,British Fiction, 1750‚Äì1770: A Chronological Check-list of Prose Fiction Printed in Britain and Ireland University of Delaware 1987, p.79 was of the French novel La fidelit√© couronn√©e, ou, L'histoire de Parmenide, prince de Macedoine by Le Coq- Madeleine, originally published in 1706. The other was a translation from the Greek of The Orations and Epistles of Isocrates. For all that Dinsdale apologised in his preface that he had \\"neither designed it too literal or too paraphrastical\\" (as had been his practice with Vani√®re), the work was later to be dismissed as \\"a correct translation without much ornament of style\\".William Thomas Lowndes, The Bibliographer‚Äôs Manual of English Literature, London 1834, vol.2, p.1005 Mention on the title page that the translation had been \\"revis‚Äôd by the Rev.

It took place in the area of Dograi village on the outskirts of Lahore in Pakistani Punjab.  Background  Dograi is a strategically important village as it is located just 1 km from Lahore, the capital of Pakistani Punjab and the 2nd largest city in Pakistan. The village being so close to Lahore gave it a high level of importance as it would be a vital bargaining chip in any territorial negotiations and exchanges after the closure of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.  Preliminaries  Prior to the main battle, the Indian Army's 3 Jat battalion had already captured Dograi on 6 September 1965 but had to abandon the place as they could not be reinforced due to strafing of supply lines by aircraft of the Pakistan Air Force. Between 6 September and 20 September, numerous attempts were made to capture Dograi, but were unsuccessful due to the position having been reinforced by the Pakistan Army. On 20 September, the 3 Jat unit, consisting of 550 men and commanded by Lt Col Desmond Hayde was tasked with recapturing the position. The defending Pakistani force was composed of 16 Punjab consisting of over 1000 men and supported by tank squadrons. 16 Punjab was commanded by Col Golwala. The battle The 3 Jat battalion advanced at night on the flanks of the Pakistani position and launched its attack. The attack was unexpected and the defenders were taken by surprise. Fighting was intense and fierce, initially with guns and grenades, then with bayonets and finally with bare hands. After 27 hours of nonstop combat and flushing out operations, the defending force either surrendered or abandoned the position and came under the control of the Indian Army. Aftermath The battle resulted in India's capture of Dograi just a day before ceasefire was announced and was used as a valuable bargaining chip in the Tashkent negotiations. The battle is commemorated by the Indian Army as it was a battle where 550 Indian troops successfully captured a fortified position from over double the number of well entrenched defenders. For gallantry, the Indian Army awarded four MVCs, 4 VrC, 7 Sena Medals, 12 Mention in Dispatches and 11 COAS Commendation Cards.

It was first conceived as a trilogy of sermons, delivered at the Harvard Memorial Church in the winter of 1969. It was subsequently published by Seabury Press, NY, in 1970.  Composition  In his second autobiographical work, Now and Then, Buechner recounts his receipt of an invitation to deliver the 1969 William Belden Noble Lectures at Harvard Memorial Church by the chaplain, Charles Price.Buechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 85. The author writes that it was Price‚Äôs prompt, that he should speak on ‚Äòreligion and letters‚Äô, that became the catalyst for the series: ‚ÄòI found myself thinking of letters literally instead‚Äô, he writes, ‚Äòof letters as the alphabet itself, the A‚Äôs, B‚Äôs, C‚Äôs, and D‚Äôs out of which all literature, all words, are ultimately composed‚Äô. He continues: > [F]rom there I wandered somehow from the notion of the events of our lives ‚Äì > even, and perhaps especially, the most everyday events ‚Äì as the alphabet > through which God, of his grace, spells out his words, his meaning, to > us.Buechner, Frederick (1983).

Buechner also discusses the writing process, referring often to the novel he was finishing as he composed the sermon series, The Entrance to Porlock.

The central theme of the work is concerned with the interaction of the extraordinary with the ordinary, and the presence of God in the mundane. Reflecting on The Alphabet of Grace in Now and Then, Buechner offers the following famous summary of the message at the heart of the work: > [I]f I were called upon to state in a few words the essence of everything I > was trying to say both as a novelist and as a preacher, it would be > something like this: Listen to your life.

Proposed by architect Haralson Bleckley in the early 1900s, the project would have seen numerous railroads in downtown Atlanta covered by a large public plaza that would have run from the Georgia State Capitol to Terminal Station, covering much of The Gulch. The project, while considered at numerous points in the early 1900s, never came to fruition.  History  The plan for a large plaza was created by Atlanta-based architect Haralson Bleckley in the early 1900s. The impetus behind the plan came in 1906 at a meeting of the Atlanta chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) where the members declared the railroad tracks running between Forsyth Street and Central Avenue in downtown Atlanta were an eyesore that required fixing. The following year, Bleckley, an AIA member, reported back to the chapter with an extensive plan to cover the railroad tracks in downtown with a system of parks and high-rise buildings, raising the street level in the process. Railroads that would be covered as part of the plan included the Central of Georgia Railroad, the Georgia Railroad, and the Western and Atlantic Railroad. This plan, emblematic of the City Beautiful movement of the time, would have included the Georgia State Capitol on the eastern end of the plaza, new public buildings along the north and south sides of the plaza, and a newly constructed French Renaissance skyscraper at the western end that would have housed a city hall, railroad depot, and municipal offices. The plan was discussed in the local newspapers at the time, including The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution in 1909. The plan was reviewed and endorsed by the Atlanta chapter in 1910. That same year, the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce partnered with the Atlanta Real Estate Board to form a Planning Commission for the purposes of seeing Bleckley's plan come to fruition. Along with the Chamber of Commerce, the plan was endorsed by many prominent Atlanta citizens and by property owners who owned land near the railroad tracks. However, the project was opposed by the railroad owners, whose grants had placed the railroad tracks on street level, and by the government of Georgia, which owned the Western and Atlantic Railroad and felt that their air rights were valuable. For several years, the project remained stalled. The project gained traction in 1916, when Atlanta mayor James G. Woodward created a Plaza Planning Commission to review the proposal. On May 3, the commission asked the Atlanta City Council to conduct an engineering study of the plan. On July 8, the architectural firm Barclay, Parsons, and Klapp presented their findings on the cost of the project and the creation of a new Union Station. The study was endorsed by the city council and the chamber of commerce, and was submitted to the Western and Atlantic Railroad Commission for their consideration. However, on June 27, 1917, the railroad commission recommended to the Georgia General Assembly that they not approve the plaza plan. Following this, the plaza plan was considered dead.  Future projects  Following the rejection of the plaza plan, Atlanta mayor Asa Griggs Candler created a commission to study the creation of viaducts in Atlanta. This led to the creation of numerous viaducts of Atlanta throughout the 1920s. The chamber of commerce would revive the idea for a public plaza covering the railroad gulch several times in the following decades, including in 1923, 1927, and 1930, though none of these plans lead to the creation of the plaza. Between 1928 and 1936, the city continued to expand its viaduct system, and in 1949, Plaza Park, a small public park, was opened near the proposed site of the plaza. Furthermore, a new Union Station was constructed in 1930 near the location Bleckley had proposed, though much smaller in scale. The idea for a plaza near the capitol building was later revived as Liberty Plaza, which was completed in 2016.

(September 30, 1977). \\"From the Publishers\\" Ampersand, p. 3. Via Newspapers.com. From 1977 to 1989 it was offered free as a supplement to various campus newspapers. History The magazine began as Ampersand in 1977, founded by Jeffrey Alan Dickey and Durand Weston \\"Randy\\" Achee, published through their privately held company Alan Weston Communications based in Burbank, California. (The company name came from the men's middle names.) Ampersand was distributed as a free supplemental insert to college papers. The founders modeled the magazine after Parade, delivered as an insert to the Sunday editions of major metropolitan newspapers, drawing income from advertisements. Ampersand was initially financed with about $100,000 in capital, including a stake from Wolfman Jack, Achee's uncle. Early interest came from record labels who signed on as advertisers, hoping to sell albums to college students. By 1978, Ampersand was available at 50 colleges, increasing to 170 colleges by 1987. The magazine was originally styled as \\"& Ampersand\\", with the typographic figure ampersand meaning \\"in addition to\\", matching the magazine's distribution model. It was published nine times during the school year, once a month from September to June. Ampersand changed its style to Ampersand's Entertainment Guide in 1987, and shifted to quarterly publication. By 1988, the market for college magazines was seen as \\"glutted\\", with some major competitors shutting down such as Chris Whittle's Campus Voice and Newsweek On Campus. Alan Weston Communications worked to gain market share by publishing additional campus magazines. In 1981, they tried Beyond, a science and technology-oriented college magazine, and in early 1985 a photography magazine called Break and then Freeze Frame, but these folded. In September 1985 they started College Woman which reached half a million students. They added Moving Up in early 1986, aimed at college men, and College Musician in September 1986, for music educators. Ampersand's Entertainment Guide was reported in 1987 as reaching 1.2 million students, the same as Newsweek On Campus.Montana, Costanza (February 18, 1987). \\"New Magazines Try to Target College Market\\".

He continued to visit Rome periodically for much of his life.*Biography and works @ the Museo del Prado The Remains of a Shipwreck In 1886, he and several other students of Villegas held a showing at the Ateneo de Madrid. The following year, he entered the National Exhibition of Fine Arts with a painting of a shipwreck and was given honorable mention. In 1888, he sent another painting of a shipwreck to the Barcelona Universal Exposition, and one called \\"Ostia\\" to the Internationalen Kunstausstellung at the Glaspalast (Munich). He continued to participate in the National Exhibition and was awarded a First Class prize in 1890 for his depiction of the Battle of Trafalgar. Shortly after, he accepted a position as an inspector for the Compa√±√≠a Transatl√°ntica Espa√±ola. As a result, he had to give up his trips to Italy and was unable to paint every day, although he made numerous, small images of the company's ships, in watercolors and pastels. Also in 1890, the Academia de Bellas Artes de C√°diz elected him as a member, but he never performed any official functions there. By 1892, he had been able to produce a sufficient body of work to compete in another exhibition at the Glaspalast; winning a Second Class medal. He also entered ten works in the National Exhibition. Although none received a prize, one of them, a monumental canvas called \\"October 1492\\", was awarded a bronze medal the following year at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. In 1895, he was represented at the National Exhibition again with, among others, a \\"Battle of Lepanto\\". He was able to return to Rome for a few months in 1901, where he created a series of pastels, featuring historical landmarks. In 1907, he was named an assistant for the Decorative Composition classes at the Escuela de Artes Industriales de C√°diz, and he left his position at Transatl√°ntica. Around 1910, he suffered the loss of an eye. Although he continued to paint, his compositions became simpler and his color scheme faded dramatically.

One of these was Aemilianus, who was proclaimed emperor by the army in Egypt in 261. Because Egypt was the granary for the city of Rome, in 262 Theodotus was sent against him. Theodotus defeated and captured Aemilianus near Thebes, and sent him to Gallienus who had him executed.

It consists of fluvial deposits with paleocurrent directions from the west. The lower beds are predominantly interbedded sandstone and mudstone while the upper beds are predominantly sandstone to conglomerate with occasional small boulders. The formation lies disconformably on the Arroyo Ojito Formation and its top beds are gravels capping the Llano de Albuquerque geomorphic surface. The lower beds sometimes contain white micritic carbonate pebbles interpreted as reworked caliche of the underlying Arroyo Ojito Formation. Total exposed thickness is . Well logs indicate that the Ceja thickens to more than in the subsurface on the western margin of the Rio Grande valley, where it likely interfingers with the Sierra Ladrones Formation. Data from fossils and radioisotope measurements indicate that the formation is Pliocene in age. These include an ash bed correlated to the 3.28 Ma Nomlaki Tuff. At Cat Mesa, the formation overlies a lava flow with a Ar-Ar age of 3.00 ¬± 0.01 Ma. A second flow within the formation has an Ar-Ar age of 2.68 ¬± 0.04 Ma. The formation is overlain by a third flow with a K-Ar age of 2.68 ¬± 0.04 Ma. A fossil pocket gopher is also consistent with a Pliocene age. Interbedded flows near Las Lunas give ages of 1.25 ¬± 0.02 Ma and 3.80 ¬± 0.04 Ma, extending the formation into the Pleistocene. The formation is divided into the Atrisco Member, Rio Puerco Member, and Santa Ana Mesa member. The Atrisco Member is reddish-brown mudstone and sandstone, some thick, mostly found in the subsurface but distinctive on well logs and discernible as a gradational boundary at the type section and as a sharper boundary further north. This is overlain by the Rio Puerco Member. Distinctive red beds of the Santa Ana Member of the Ceja Formation in flank of Santa Ana Mesa, New Mexico, USAThe Santa Ana Mesa Member consists of reddish-brown sandstone and conglomerate conspicuous in the flanks of Santa Ana Mesa. It contains a 7.1 Ma pumice bed. The unit is typically redder than the other members of the Ceja Formation. The Rio Puerco Member named for the Rio Puerco. It forms a very poorly sorted mesa-capping gravel along Ceja del Rio Puerco. It disconformably overlies the Atrisco Member to the north but interfingers with the Atrisco Member further south. History of investigation The unit was first defined by V.C. Kelley in 1977 for beds formerly assigned to the upper buff member of the Santa Fe Formation by Bryan and McCann in 1936.Bryan and McCann 1936Kelley 1977 Connell et al. reassigned the member to the Arroyo Ojito Formation in 1999.Connell et al. 1999 In 2007, Williams and Cole recommended that the Arroyo Ojito Formation be abandoned, because the name was being used inconsistently and because the formation straddled a significant region unconformityWilliams and Cole 2007, p.11 since named the Rincones paleosurface.Connell 2008, p.15 They promoted the Ceja Member, which lay above the Rincones paleosurface, to formation rank, a recommendation with which Connell subsequently concurred.

He was raised in a working class African family who believed in the value of education. After completing Grade 12 in 1954, Masondo went to Fort Hare University and majored in physics and mathematics. He completed his BSc in 1957 and, in the following year, became one of the first two black students to complete the BSc (Honours) degree in applied mathematics at the University of the Witwatersrand. In 1959, these two students completed the one-year University Education Diploma at Fort Hare, again the first black students to do so. By 1960, Masondo was lecturing pure and applied mathematics at the University of Fort Hare. His wide reading and cultural interaction with other scholars as well as the township community helped to develop an individual in touch with diverse groups of people. Military career and activism In 1953, Andrew Masondo joined the African National Congress (ANC). In 1962/3, he held several posts within the structure of the ANC in the Eastern Cape, mainly as a rural area organiser but also in the higher command structure. In 1963, as the command director of the underground Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) movement, the military wing of the ANC, he began to take part in sabotage activities in South Africa, cutting electricity pylons in the vicinity of Alice, armed with a number of devices, including a saw and an old rifle he had found buried in a garden. Imprisonment Masondo was arrested in 1963 and sentenced to twelve years' imprisonment on Robben Island, where he was later joined by top Rivonia trialists such as Govan Mbeki, Walter Sisulu, and Nelson Mandela. In 1964, he was sentenced to an additional three years, two of which would be served concurrently with his original sentence, bringing the total to thirteen years. In prison, Masondo again turned to education. Through UNISA, he completed second-year mathematical statistics and third-year mathematics for the second time and obtained his BSc (Honours) in Mathematical Statistics. In 1975, he registered for a BCom in statistics, but did not complete the course after losing his study privileges when he intervened to defend Walter Sisulu and Govan Mbeki in a case of alleged insubordination against a white man. Release from prison and exile Andrew Masondo was released from prison in 1976 and placed under house arrest. With the help of Oliver Tambo and his wife, he escaped to Swaziland in June 1976. From there, he went to Mozambique and Tanzania. He received military training, including a commander's course and a course in guerilla warfare, in the Soviet Union. In Angola, he became a national commissar of the MK, as well as a member of the ANC's national executive and Revolutionary Council. From 1978 to 1990, he lectured at the Solomon Mahlangu Freedom College in Tanzania, becoming the principal of the college. After serving as an MK ambassador and underground commander in Uganda, he returned to Angola in 1994, to deal with the repatriation of MK soldiers in exile, returning to a new, democratic South Africa. Later career and retirement Gen Masondo attended a Joint Staff Course at the Defence College, after the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) was established in April 1994, and subsequently promoted to the rank of major general. From 1994 until his retirement on 31 October 2001 with the rank of lieutenant-general, he held many posts - Chairman of the Integration Committee, Chief Director of Equal Opportunity, Chief Director of Corporate Communication, and Chief of the Service Corps. After his retirement, General Masondo remained active in the corporate, education, and heritage spheres of South African life. He served on numerous boards and committees in the fields of education, museums, indigenous knowledge, traditional healing, reconciliation and medicine. Death Masondo was diagnosed with kidney failure in 2005, he died on Sunday 20 April 2008 in the One Military Hospital in Tshwane at the age of 71. He is survived by five children and six grandchildren.

The palace was erected in the Baroque style at the end of the 17th century. It is adjacent to the Branicki and Szaniawski palaces. The palace erected at the end of the 17th century originally belonged to the Mazovian Voivode Stanislaw Morsztyn, later to the Sandomierz Voivode Stefan Bidzinski. It was built in the shape of letter E. From 14 July to 4 September 1707 it was visited by Tsar Peter I. In 1766 it was owned by the Bishop of Przemy≈õl, Andrzej M≈Çodziejowski, for whom the palace was extended by Jakub Fontana before 1771. In the course of this extension, side aisles were created in the form of side wings connected by an arcade gallery supporting the terrace. Andrzej M≈Çodziejowski; portrait by Ludwik Marteau In 1782 the Old Warsaw City Council put the palace up for sale because of the debt. In 1784, the Russian Metropolis was already inscribed as the owner. In the 1890s, the palace housed the Russian ambassador Osip Igelstr√∂m who during the Kosciuszko Uprising was the target of attacks led by Jan Kili≈Ñski, and was destroyed. In the years 1806-1808 it was rebuilt in the classicist style according to the design of Frederick Albert Lessel for Feliks Potocki and in the years 1808-1811 wings were built from Podwale Street. These pavilions, together with the outbuildings, formed a courtyard limited on the street side by iron rails. After 1818 the palace was owned by Karol Zeydler. From 1820 there was a Merchant Resursa, moved around 1829 to the Mniszch√≥w Palace. Then there were bookshops and many stores in the palace.

Early life and education Angus M'Bean, born was born in 1656. He was of the family of Kinchyle. M'Bean was educated at King's College, Aberdeen, graduation with an M.A. on 13 July 1675. He was the session-clerk at Foveran from 23 December 1677 to February 1678. In church records he is noted to have been licensed (on the recommendation of Professor Menzies of Aberdeen) and officiated for a time in Ayrshire. He is recorded to have been presented by Thomas Fraser of Strichen in October, had a certificate for ordination dated 28 November, and was ordaineed and installed on 29 December 1683. Becoming doubtful as to Episcopacy, he \\"inveighed against the sins and errors of his time, particularly against Popery, with great judgment, zeal, and boldness,\\" and on 23 October 1687, he preached a memorable sermon (from Job xxxiv.,31, 32) in which he recanted his former opinions and demitted his charge, \\"some of his hearers being angry, and some surprised, but those who received most good of his ministry were all in tears.\\" He now actively joined the Presbyterians and conducted services in private houses and in the open air, and, returning to Inverness, gathered round him a large congregation. Legal trouble Having gone to Edinburgh, he was apprehended, brought before the Privy Council, and after a brief term of imprisonment (from 1 December) was permitted to return home, Duncan Forbes of Culloden giving bail to a large amount that he would answer when called. In February 1688 he received a second summons to appear before the Council on six days' notice. Though in feeble health, and the cold intense, he hastened to Edinburgh and reported himself a few hours before his bail expired. He was handed over to an ecclesiastical court, consisting of Arthur, Archbishop of St Andrews, and eight clerical coadjutors. Boldly avowing his change of creed and refusing to return to Episcopacy, he was deposed and committed to the Tolbooth, where he lay for most of the year, Forbes of Culloden and Sir Robert Gordon of Gordonstoun, Bart., vainly offering 10,000 merks (¬£555, lis.

He traveled extensively in Uele District, where he resolved the question of whether the Uele River was the upper portion of the Ubangi River. He was second in command of an expedition to the Nile in 1891‚Äì1892, and took over command after the leader died. Early years (1861‚Äì1888) Jules Alexandre Milz was born in Virton in Belgian Lorraine on 10 September 1861. His parents were Jacques Milz and Jos√©phine Philippart. He joined the 2nd Mounted Chasseurs on 20 August 1880, and was appointed second lieutenant to the 4th Lancers on 29 June 1883. He entered the service of the Congo Free State in 1888. Roget Expedition (1888‚Äì1891) On 17 June 1888 Milz left Antwerp as an officer of the Force Publique. He arrived in Boma on 25 July 1888 and was assigned to the Bangalas District, where Willem Frans Van Kerckhoven was preparing the vanguard of the L√©on Roget expedition. The task was to establish entrenched camps on the Aruwimi River and Sankuru River for defense against Arab slavers. Milz left Bangala on 24 October 1888 with the column led by Francis Dhanis. The column founded posts at Umangi, Upoto and Yambuya. On 8 February 1889 the column was at the confluence of the Aruwimi with the Congo River, where the Basoko station was established, capital of the new Aruwimi- Uele District. Roget took command there on 28 July 1889. The expedition then founded the posts of Bomane, Bassoa and Yambisi. Milz was put in charge of Bomane, then of Bassoa. In April 1890 Milz and Joseph Duvivier accompanied Roget to found a post in Djabir (Bondo) on the Uele. They established the Ibembo station on the Itimbiri River, where they left Duvivier in command. Milz went on with Roget to the Go rapids, then overland to the Likati River where they founded the Ekwangatana post. They entrusted this post to an African officer. They returned to Ibembo, then went NNE towards the upper Likati and Djabir, crossing the Tinda River basin. They founded Mopocho between Ibembo and the Likati on 23 May 1890, which they also entrusted to an African officer. On 25 May 1890 they crossed the Likati and on 27 May 1890 reached the Uele River opposite Sultan Djabar's village. Sultan Djabir signed a treaty with Milz and a post was established on the site of the former Egyptian zeriba of Deleb. Milz began construction of the station while Roget, guided by Sultan Djabir, tried unsuccessfully to join Alphonse van G√®le in Yakoma. Roget had gone north as far as Mbili and Gangu, having heard that the country downstream was too dangerous. On 9 June 1890 he returned to Djabir. Roget left Djabir in July to return to Basoko, the Pool and Boma, leaving Milz in command with instructions to attempt the liaison with Yakoma. In July‚ÄìAugust 1890 Milz and his assistant Mahutte and Sultan Djabir led 100 fusiliers and 400 lancers in an attempt to push through the non-submissive people along the right bank, but were forced to return to Djabir after nine days. In September Milz had to repel an attack by the Arabs under Kipanga- Panga. There are conflicting reports about who took the initiative, but it seems that Van G√®le heard of the presence of a European in Djabar on November 18 and set out via a roundabout route up the Uele, reaching the village of Gamanza on 2 December. The next day he met Milz, who was coming to meet him. This resolved the Ubangi-Uele question. Milz and Van G√®le heard that the Arabs were operating in the lower Bima River and on the Rubi River and set out for that region. In December 1890 they succeeded in expelling the Muslim traders. Nile Expedition (1891‚Äì1892) Semio, Sultan of the Asande Avungura. Water- colour by E. M. Heims, 1911 When Milz's term was over he went to Stanley Pool. There, in March 1891, Van Kerckhoven asked him to return to the Uele to become second in command of his expedition to the Nile. Milz accepted and was in Basoko by 26 March 1891. At the start of July most of the Van Kerckhoven expedition had gathered in Djabir, consisting of 15 Europeans and 500 Africans of the Force Publique. The vanguard, led by Pierre Ponthier, set off upstream on 7 July 1891. In August Milz was sent to visit Sultan Semio to obtain his help for the expedition. Milz sent Van Kerckhoven a message on 25 November announcing that Semio was now an ally, and on 25 November Milz and Semo arrived at Bomokandi camp with 600 soldiers and 500 porters. Orders were given for the march to the Nile. Ponthier, Semio and his soldiers would go by land, while Milz would accompany Van Kerckhoven with the provisions by water. The columns left on 12 December and rejoined at Amadi on 22 December, where they started to build a post. On 30 December 1891 Van Kerckhoven, Milz, Ponthier and others left Amadi and headed south. They were at the Mbe-Bomokandi confluence on 1 January 1892, where Ponthier fell sick and had to return via Djabir to Boma. After having obtained the submission of the main chiefs of the region, who had given them enough canoes, the expedition returned to Amadis on 24 January and moved out on 29 January. The flotilla was on the Bomokandi on 2 February 1892. Milz, Gustave Gustin, Cl√©ment-Fran√ßois Vande Vliet and Semio, who had traveled by land along the south bank of the Uele, were attacked by the . They continued, making contact with the local chiefs and selecting sites for new posts, and reached the confluence of the Gada River with the Uele on 18 March, where they chose to build a new station at the village of Mbegu, named Niangara. Van Kerckhoven arrived there on 25 March 1892, and Jean-Hubert Cloesen was placed in charge of the post. On April 7 the vanguard continued its march, leaving Van Kerckhoven, who was bedridden, behind in Niangara. Milz and Vande Vliet, who had come from Niangara to Bomokandi, left Bomokandi on 22 April and reached Mbittima on 2 June. Semio was sent in advance to prepare the populations. On 6 June Van Kerckhoven, Milz, Montangie and Vande Vliet left Mbittima by canoe. They reached Surur on 10 June and decided to go up the Nzoro River, but found it blocked by rapids, which were called the Milz Falls. The column was divided, leaving 200 of the less able-bodied men at the foot of the rapids, while the others went ahead in search of the Gustin-Semio advance guard. On 11 July Van Kerckhoven and Milz left by land along the south bank of the Nzoro through difficult country, with the soldiers carrying their loads for lack of porters. They reached Tagomolanghi on 25 July 1892. Kerckhoven died in Djebel Watti on 10 August 1892. He was accidentally killed by a shot from the gun his boy was reloading. He was buried there and Milz took command. Leaving Mount Beka on 12 August 1892, the expedition soon reached the Khor Arave, a tributary of the Nile. They made camp and sent a scouting party towards the Nile. On 19 August Milz was at Mount Lehmin, among the Kakwas. On 24 August he found the Kibbi River, where he set up a camp named Fort Lehmin. He continued northeast, and reached the old Egyptian zeriba of Ganda where he installed Gustin. In October 1892 he reached Wadelai on the Nile to the north of Lake Albert. He enlisted soldiers of Emin Pasha whom he found remaining in the region, but they proved unreliable. Under pressure from the Mahdists he was forced to withdraw. Mila made his way west towards the Dungu River. He left Semio in Ndirfi, and continued towards Faraki on the upper Dungu. He set up the Faradje post a small distance upstream from Mundu. On 18 December 1892 he reached the Dungu-Kibali confluence, the head of the Uele, where Florimond Delanghe was waiting to take over command of the expedition. Milz began to develop a post that was named Dungu. Later career (1893‚Äì1901) On 20 January 1893 Milz officially handed over command of the Nile and Haut-Uele posts to Delanghe. He went with Delanghe to Niangara, which he reached on 17 February. He returned to Boma on 23 October 1893, and embarked from Cabinda on 28 October. Milz was appointed captain of the 1st Regiment of Guides. On 30 June 1900 he left again for Africa, charged with a special mission to delimit the Belgian-German border in Kivu. He returned to Europe on 27 July 1901. He died in Brussels of angina pectoris on 1 October 1902.

She was a founder of the Tatarstan independence party The Ittifaq Party. From 1990 to 1995 she was a member of the State Council of the Republic of Tatarstan. From 1994 to 1997 she was the chair of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People, the unrecognized Tatar parliament, which she helped to establish. She was also a contributor to the constitution of Tatarstan. She has written a number of political manifestos and histories, focusing on topics relating to the Tatar people and their political circumstances, and has worked as a journalist and publisher. Life and career Bayramova was born on December 5, 1950 in Sabayevo, Bashkortostan. She attended theatre school in Kazan, and then from 1983 to 1989 she studied philology at the Kazan Federal University. After graduating from university she worked for a television station in Kazan. She then worked at a publishing house, followed by a variety of journalism jobs at several newspapers and magazines. She earned the equivalent of a doctoral degree in history, namely a Candidate of Sciences degree, specializing in the history of Tatars in the early 20th century. In 1988, Bayramova joined the Tatar Public Center, which advocates increased autonomy for Tatarstan and promotes the Tatar language. In 1990, Bayramova founded the Tatar nationalist party The Ittifaq Party, a pro-independence party in Tatarstan. She led the party for more than 20 years, and she was involved in publishing the party newspaper Altƒ±n Urda from 1993 to 1998. In 1991 she held a two week long hunger strike to protest the holding of Russian presidential elections in Tatarstan, which helped to spark a large protest movement against the Russian elections being held there. The elections were canceled in response to the protests. From 1990 to 1995, Bayramova was a member of the regional parliament of Tatarstan. After the founding of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People in 1991, she worked as its chair from 1994 to 1997. In addition to her political activities and activism, Bayramova is also notable for her work as a writer. In 1986 she was admitted to the Union of Soviet Writers, and in 1994 she became a member of the Writers' Union of Tatarstan. Her writing focuses on the political issues confronting Tatar people and their history, though her works include fiction and art criticism. She has written a number of political manifestos, and she was a contributor to the Constitution of Tatarstan. She has also written histories of the Tatar people which seek to emphasize their historical unity as a cohesive ethnic group. The Tatar Gazette has argued that Bayramova has been the most prominent woman in Tatar politics since S√∂yembik√§ of Kazan, noting that her uncompromising ethnic nationalism contrasted strongly with Tatar politicians like Mintimer Shaimiev who came to power within the Russian state through willingness to compromise.

She worked as a researcher for the French National Centre for Scientific Research until retirement in 2001, but has continued to publish until 2020. She co-founded FMA (F√©minin, Masculin, Avenir), one of the ancestors that later would become Mouvement de lib√©ration des femmes in 1970. Biography=Early life Jacqueline Feldman was born in Paris of secular Polish Jewish immigrants, her father working as a tailor. Her parents moved to Paris from ≈Å√≥d≈∫ at the end of the 1920s . She has an older sister, born in 1932. During the second world war, the family moved from Paris to Noir√©table in order to avoid the Nazis. After the war, the family returned to Paris. Early professional career as physicist After getting a job at the CNRS i 1956, she would be sent to the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen where she started a French doctoral PhD in theoretical physics with Ben Roy Mottelson as advisor. She would meet her future husband Hallstein H√∏g√•sen here. In 1961 she published a paper that would later be cited by Mottelson in his Nobel lecture (1975) . The final paper of her French doctoral thesis was published in 1963. She worked as a physicist at Norwegian Institute of Technology (1963‚Äì64) and at the CERN (1964‚Äì67). Professional career as a sociologist In 1968 she would switch professionally from theoretical physics to sociology. She had always been interested in sociology, an interest that was enhanced by the political events in Paris in 1968. The sociologists at CNRS were in need of people with strong mathematical background, permitting her to work with them. Witnessing the very different ways of thinking in the hard and soft sciences , she developed epistemological reflections about it. as well as comments on the Sokal affair She also worked on the taboos of sexuality, feminism, and women in science. FMA In 1967 Feldman and Anne Zelensky founded the FMA. The abbreviation was originally F√©minin, Masculin, Avenir (Feminine, Masculine, Future). As one of several groups, FMA would in 1970 becomeMLF. While the other ancestors of the MLF were purely focused on women's rights and emancipation, the FMA originally had members of both genders and had a focus on women and men collaborating for a better society and relationship between genders. It would after the events of May 1968 become a women-only group with the name changed to F√©minism, Marxisme, Action (Feminism, Marxism, Action). At and during the occupation of Sorbonne in May 1968, Feldman and Zelensky would organize women-themed meetings, inviting and having √âvelyne Sullerot to one of them.  Jewishness  After the MLF developed and Feldman could better define herself as a woman in a male-dominated society, she would consider the problem of her non-religious jewishness, together with other women. She wrote one of the first articles on what is now called Intersectionality.  Work as historian  Critique of science = After May 1968, she criticized scientism through articles in the critical review Impascience (1975-1977). All contributions were anonymous, in accordance to ideas of the time: The content was important, not the author. In Impasciences she collaborated with Fran√ßoise Laborie and would later publish a biography on Laborie. The book also treats the critique of science by scientists after May 1968. = Taboo and sexuality = Using he most popular dictionary in France, the Petit Larousse, Feldman shows in the book \\"La sexualit√© du Petit Larousse, ou, Le jeu du dictionnaire\\" the evolution of taboos on sexuality by studying the different versions of the dictionary from it first version in 1905 to 1979. = Condorcet and social mathematics = She has published work on Condorcet, a French mathematician and philosopher being the first to propose social mathematics . = Jews during 2nd world war = As a child and at the start of the second world war, her family moved from Paris to the village Noir√©table being in the zone libre until 1942 and hence avoided destiny of many Jews in Paris thanks to the village. As a way to show her gratitude, she worked as a witness and historian for Noir√©table and the Loire department in central France. Marriage and children Feldman was married in 1961 to physicist Hallstein H√∏g√•sen that she met at the Niels Bohr Institute - they divorced in 1975. They have two children, a boy (born 1962) and a girl (1963). Philosophical and/or political views She has always been somewhat involved in trying to change society. In 1960 that was supporting the independence of Algeria, later she was active in the May 68 student movement and the right of women and workers. In 2019, with feminist friends, she launched a call to obtain the right of Assisted suicide.

She has been a member of Europe Ecology ‚Äì The Greens (EELV) since 2013. She was elected in 2014 to the City Council of Strasbourg, and to the Eurom√©tropole de Strasbourg Council. She was elected mayor of Strasbourg after she successfully led the EELV list in the 2020 municipal election there. Early life Barseghian was born in Suresnes to a French family of Armenian descent. Her great-grandfather was the Armenian intellectual Sarkis Barseghian (fr), and her great-grandmother was the writer and Member of the Armenian Parliament Perchuhi Partizpanyan-Barseghyan. Barseghian studied law at Paris Nanterre University, specializing first in Franco-German law.

The third typhoon of the 2020 Pacific typhoon season, Maysak formed from a tropical disturbance. The disturbance gradually organized, receiving the name Julian from PAGASA as it became a tropical depression. As the depression strengthened, the JMA subsequently named the system Maysak. Maysak rapidly intensified into a strong typhoon before weakening and making landfall in South Korea. Maysak was the second of three typhoons to affect the Korean Peninsula within two weeks, the others being Bavi and Haishen. Meteorological history Following the impacts of Typhoon Bavi on the Korean peninsula in August 2020, the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) began to anticipate the development of a new tropical cyclone with the potential to be stronger and more damaging for the region than Bavi. The KMA assessed a high probability of the storm's development, but noted that its future impacts were uncertain; the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also determined that there was a high likelihood of a \\"significant tropical cyclone\\" developing. Maysak's precursor disturbance was an area of low pressure over the western Pacific east of the Philippines. At 06:00 UTC on August 27, the Japan Meteorological Agency determined that a nearly stationary tropical depression had formed near 15¬∞N, 132¬∞E. The JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system around the same time. The newly formed system was located in an environment conducive to storm development, including warm sea surface temperatures and low vertical wind shear. Clusters of atmospheric convection emerged around the storm's center, comprising formative rainbands wrapping into the developing circulation. Early on August 28, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assessed the system as a tropical depression with the local name Julian. At 06:00 UTC, the JMA assessed the tropical depression to have strengthened into a tropical storm, assigning it with the name Maysak. By this time, outflow had become established and curvature of the Maysak's rainbands became apparent on satellite imagery. The storm's cloud tops cooled substantially, indicative of further consolidation of its circulation. Maysak became a severe tropical storm twelve hours later. Maysak became a typhoon by 12:00 UTC on August 29 according to the JMA after developing an eye. The storm also began to move towards the north in response to a nearby subtropical ridge of high pressure. On August 30, Maysak's structure became indicative of an impending phase of rapid intensification according to the JTWC. The typhoon developed a central dense overcast that day with an eye embedded within. An approaching trough over eastern China and western Japan caused Maysak to accelerate towards the north as it continued to traverse energetic ocean waters. The typhoon's eye became symmetric and spanned 55 km (35 mi) across. By 21:00 UTC, the eye had contracted to a diameter of 19 km (12 mi). Around that time, the JTWC assessed the typhoon as having one-minute sustained winds of 215 km/h (130 mph). At 00:00 UTC on September 1, the JMA determined that Maysak had ten-minute maximum sustained winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) with gusts of up to 250 km/h (155 mph). The associated barometric pressure was estimated at 935 hPa (mbar; 27.61 inHg). Maysak held this intensity as it began to move into a less conducive environment for storm development within the East China Sea. Soon, Maysak began to weaken steadily as it passed the East China Sea, slowing back down to a Category 3 storm. The storm then made landfall near Busan, South Korea at 02:20 KST on September 3 (17:20 UTC on September 2), with 10-minute maximum sustained winds at 155 km/h (100 mph) and the central pressure at 950 hPa equivalent into a Category 2 typhoon. After that, it crossed the Sea of Japan and hitting North Korea into Jilin, Manchuria in China. Soon after, Typhoon Maysak transitioned into an extratropical low in northeast China. Preparations and impact The storm affected the eastern parts of North Korea, China, and Russia, along with the Ryukyu Islands, causing at least 32 deaths and damage to more than 9,200 houses. Total combined economic losses were anticipated to surpass $100 million USD. Japan The JMA urged residents of Okinawa to evacuate in anticipation of a potentially \\"major disaster\\" from Maysak; 560 people ultimately evacuated. The agency also warned of the possibility of tornadoes in the region. Schools, stores, and public offices throughout the prefecture closed. As many as 266 flights linking to Okinawa were cancelled, affecting roughly 9,200 travelers. The Naha Airport closed its passenger terminal in advance of Maysak. The cancellation of flights at Okinawa also led to the cancellation of 10 percent of departures from Haneda Airport. Kadena Air Force Base was placed on Tropical Cyclone Conditions of Readiness level 1 (TCCOR 1), denoting the onset of destructive winds. Okinawa was buffeted by wind gusts generally ranging between 100‚Äì130 km/h (60‚Äì80 mph). A peak gust of 163 km/h (101 mph) was measured in Nanj≈ç. Wind gusts reached 195 km/h (120 mph) at Kumejima Airport. Power outages affected 1,580 electricity customers in Nago, Naha, and Nakijin. Officials in Kyushu warned of strong winds and mudslides. Maysak caused powerful winds and drenching rainfall to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan as it passed through, also causing some power outages. However, only minimal damage was reported. =Gulf Livestock 1 shipwreck= On 2 September 2020, Panamanian-flagged cargo ship with 43 crew members, including 39 seamen from the Philippines, two from New Zealand and two from Australia, and thousands of cattle onboard was reported missing in the East China Sea. The Japan Coast Guard said it has found one person drifting in rough waters in a lifejacket. A distress signal was sent from the ship shortly before disappearing. The body of a person was found two days later. By October, the remaining 30+ seamen were declared dead. South Korea In South Korea, 2,200 people were evacuated into shelters in preparation for Maysak. Two fatalities were recorded, over 120,000 customers lost power in South Korea, and over 5,100 hectares of farmland were damaged, as well as over 800 structures. South Korea‚Äôs Ministry of Interior and Safety cited notable damage to nearly 2,000 buildings. North Korea Maysak brought heavy rainfall to eastern North Korea peaking at 15.157 inches (385 mm) in Wonsan. Photos showed streets and buildings being flooded in the area. North Korea's state television network once more broadcast live storm reports overnight from State Hydro- Meteorological Administration and outside as they had did with Typhoon Bavi just a week previous to Maysak. Russia A truck overturned and a floating dock crashed into warships from the extratropical remnants of Maysak.

This is achieved by measuring chemical or biological entities (biomarkers) in wastewater generated by the people contributing to a wastewater treatment plant catchment. Wastewater-based epidemiology is commonly used to estimate illicit drug use in communities or populations, but can be used to measure the consumption of alcohol, caffeine, various pharmaceuticals and other compounds. Wastewater-based epidemiology has also been adapted to measure the load of pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 in a community. It differs from traditional drug testing, urine or stool testing in that results are a population aggregate. Wastewater-based epidemiology is an interdisciplinary endeavour that draws on input from specialists such as wastewater treatment plant operators, analytical chemists and epidemiologists.  History  By the turn of the 21st century, numerous studies reported identified anthropogenic chemicals and human pathogens in wastewater and in surface waters receiving wastewater discharge. Eventually, some of these studies these were able to use measurements of chemicals and pathogens as proxies for chemical consumption or pathogen exposure. For example, an early wastewater-based epidemiology study published in 2005 measured cocaine and its metabolite benzoylecgognine in water samples from the River Po in Italy. These measurements were used to estimate cocaine consumption in communities discharging wastewater into the river. Since then, wastewater-based epidemiology has further developed and is used in multiple countries to measure the consumption of various chemicals. Wastewater-based epidemiology has been supported by government bodies such as the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in Europe. Similar counterparts in other countries, such as the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission in Australia and authorities in China use wastewater-based epidemiology to monitor drug use in their populations.  Principle  Wastewater-based epidemiology can be likened to urinalysis on a community scale. Small molecule compounds consumed by an individual can be excreted in the urine and/or feces in the form of the unchanged parent compound or a metabolite. In communities with reticulated sewers, this urine combines with other wastes including other individuals' urine as they travel to a wastewater treatment plant. Wastewater is sampled at the inlet of a wastewater treatment plant, prior to water treatment. This is ideally done with autosampler devices which collect 24-hour flow or time composite samples. These samples contain biochemical information, or biomarkers from all the people contributing to a wastewater treatment plant catchment. Collected samples are sent to a laboratory, where analytical chemistry techniques (namely liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) are used to quantify compounds of interest. These results can be expressed in per capita loads using information regarding the volume of wastewater which the sample represents. Results can be further expressed as per capita loads when given the population served by a wastewater treatment plant. The following equation summarises how per capita consumption of a chemical of interest (e.g. a drug) is determined: \\\\text{Daily consumption} = {{\\\\frac{R \\\\times F \\\\times C}{P}}} Where R is the concentration of a chemical residue in a wastewater sample, F is the volume of wastewater which the sample represents, C is a correction factor which reflects the average mass and molar excretion fraction of a parent drug or a metabolite, and P is the number of people in a wastewater catchment. Variations or modifications may be made to C to account for other factors such as the degradation of a chemical during its transport in the sewer system.  Applications  Commonly detected chemicals include, but are not limited to the following; * Cocaine * Amphetamine * Methamphetamine * Methylone * Ecstacy * Heroin * Alcohol * Nicotine * Caffeine * Ketamine * Opioids * Antidepressants * Antipsychotics * Antimicrobials * Antihistamines * Aritificial sweeteners  Temporal comparisons By analyzing samples taken across different time points, day-to-day or longer term trends can be assessed. This approach has illustrated trends such as increased consumption of alcohol and recreational drugs on weeknds comapred to weekends. A temporal wastewater-based epidemiology study in Washington measured wastewater samples in Washington before, during and after cannabis legalisation. By comparing cannabis consumption in wastewater with sales of cannabis through legal outlets, the study showed that the opening of legal outlets led to a decrease in the market share of the illegal market. Spatial comparisons Differences in chemical consumption amongst different locations can be established when comparable methods are used to analyse wastewater samples from different locations. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction conducts regular multi-city tests in Europe to estimate the consumption of illegal drugs. Data from these monitoring efforts are used alongside more traditional monitoring methods to understand geographical changes in drug consumption trends.  Virus surveillance Wastewater can also be tested for signatures of viruses excreted via feces, such as the enteroviruses poliovirus, aichivirus and coronavirus. Systematic wastewater surveillance programs for monitoring enteroviruses, namely poliovirus, was instituted as early as 1996 in Russia. Wastewater testing is recognised as an important tool for poliovirus surveillance by the WHO, especially in situations where mainstream surveillance methods are lacking, or where viral circulation or introduction is suspected.https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/67854/WHO_V- B_03.03_eng.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed;=y Wastewater-based epidemiology of viruses has the potential to inform on the presence of viral outbreaks when or where it is not suspected. A 2013 study of archived wastewater samples from the Netherlands found viral RNA of Aichivirus A in Dutch sewage samples dating back to 1987, two years prior to the first identification of Aichivirus A in Japan. During the COVID-19 pandemic, wastewater-based epidemiology using qPCR and/or RNA-Seq was used in various countries as a complementary method for assessing the load of COVID-19 in populations. Regular surveillance programs for monitoring SARS-Cov-2 in wastewater has been instituted in populations within countries such as Canada, China, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain and the United States. As of August 5th 2020, the WHO recognises wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 as a potentially useful source of information on the prevalence and temporal trends of COVID-19 in communities, while highlighting that gaps in research such as viral shedding characteristics should be addressed.

The process is typically carried out at very high pressure, with the help of a nickel catalyst (that is removed from the final product). Their partial hydrogenation reduces most, but not all, of these carbon-carbon double bonds. The degree of hydrogenation is controlled by restricting the amount of hydrogen, reaction temperature and time, and the catalyst.Ian P. Freeman \\"Margarines and Shortenings\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. The goal is to turn liquid oils into solid or semi-solid fats that can replace butter and shortening in spreads, candies, baked good, and other products. :Partial hydrogenation of a typical plant oil to a typical component of margarine. Most of the C=C double bonds are removed in this process, which elevates the melting point of the product. Hydrogenation converts liquid vegetable oils into solid or semi-solid fats, such as those present in margarine. Changing the degree of saturation of the fat changes some important physical properties, such as the melting range, which is why liquid oils become semi-solid. Solid or semi-solid fats are preferred for baking because the way the fat mixes with flour produces a more desirable texture in the baked product. Because partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are cheaper than animal fats, they are available in a wide range of consistencies, and have other desirable characteristics (such as increased oxidative stability and longer shelf life), they are the predominant fats used as shortening in most commercial baked goods. Full hydrogenation results in a molecule containing the maximum amount of hydrogen (in other words, the conversion of an unsaturated fatty acid into a saturated one). Partial hydrogenation results in the addition of hydrogen atoms at some of the empty positions, with a corresponding reduction in the number of double bonds. Typical commercial hydrogenation is partial to obtain a malleable mixture of fats that is solid at room temperature, but melts during baking, or consumption. The \\"trans fat\\" problem A side effect of incomplete hydrogenation having implications for human health is the isomerization of some of the remaining unsaturated carbon bonds to their trans isomers. Trans fats (resulting from partial hydrogenation) have been implicated in circulatory diseases including heart disease. The conversion from cis to trans bonds is chemically favored because the trans configuration has lower energy than the natural cis one. At equilibrium, the trans/cis isomer ratio is about 2:1. Many countries and regions have introduced mandatory labeling of trans fats on food products and appealed to the industry for voluntary reductions. The food industry has moved away from partially hydrogenated fats (i.e. trans fats) and towards fully hydrogenated fats and interesterified fats in response to bad publicity about trans fats, labeling requirements, and removal of trans fats from the FDA list of foods Generally Recognized as Safe. Catalytic partial hydrogenation necessarily produces trans-fats, because of the reaction mechanism. In the first reaction step, one hydrogen is added, with the other, coordinatively unsaturated, carbon being attached to the catalyst. The second step is the addition of hydrogen to the remaining carbon, producing a saturated fatty acid. The first step is reversible, such that the hydrogen is readsorbed on the catalyst and the double bond is re-formed. The intermediate with only one hydrogen added contains no double bond and can freely rotate. Thus, the double bond can re-form as either cis or trans, of which trans is favored, regardless the starting material. Complete hydrogenation does not have this side effect, because it also hydrogenates any produced trans fats to give saturated fats. Numerous studies have concluded that these trans fatty acids have negative health effects. As a result, many countries have enacted trans fat regulation that aims to eliminate or severely restrict their amount in industrialized food products. History Cover of original Crisco cookbook, 1912 Nobel laureate Paul Sabatier worked in the late 1890s to develop the chemistry of hydrogenation, which enabled the margarine, oil hydrogenation, and synthetic methanol industries. Whereas Sabatier considered hydrogenation of only vapors, the German chemist Wilhelm Normann showed in 1901 that liquid oils could be hydrogenated, and patented the process in 1902. During the years 1905‚Äì1910, Normann built a fat-hardening facility in the Herford company. At the same time, the invention was extended to a large-scale plant in Warrington, England, at Joseph Crosfield & Sons, Limited. It took only two years until the hardened fat could be successfully produced in the plant in Warrington, commencing production in the autumn of 1909. The initial year's production totalled nearly 3,000 tonnes. In 1909, Procter & Gamble acquired the United States rights to the Normann patent; in 1911, they began marketing the first hydrogenated shortening, Crisco (composed largely of partially hydrogenated cottonseed oil). Further success came from the marketing technique of giving away free cookbooks in which every recipe called for Crisco. Wilhelm Normann patented the hydrogenation of liquid oils in 1902 Normann's hydrogenation process made it possible to stabilize affordable whale oil or fish oil for human consumption, a practice kept secret to avoid consumer distaste. During Napoleon's reign in France in the early 19th century, a type of margarine was invented to feed the troops using tallow and buttermilk. It was not accepted in the United States. In the early 20th century, soybeans began to be imported into the United States as a source of protein; soybean oil was a by-product. What to do with that oil became an issue. At the same time, there was not enough butterfat available for consumers. The method of hydrogenating fat and turning a liquid fat into a solid one had been discovered, and now the ingredients (soybeans) and the need (shortage of butter) were there. Later, the means for storage, the refrigerator, was a factor in trans fat development. The fat industry found that hydrogenated fats provided some special features to margarines, which allowed margarine, unlike butter, to be taken out of a refrigerator and immediately spread on bread. By some minor changes to the chemical composition of hydrogenated fat, such hydrogenated fat was found to provide superior baking properties compared to lard. Margarine made from hydrogenated soybean oil began to replace butterfat. Hydrogenated fat such as Crisco and Spry, sold in England, began to replace butter and lard in baking bread, pies, cookies, and cakes in 1920. Production of hydrogenated fats increased steadily until the 1960s, as processed vegetable fats replaced animal fats in the United States and other Western countries. At first, the argument was a financial one due to lower costs; advocates also said that the unsaturated trans fats of margarine were healthier than the saturated fats of butter.

Initially hired to be CBN's foreign correspondent in Jerusalem, she was instead made co-host of The 700 Club days after arriving at CBN's headquarters in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Reflecting on her experiences in her memoirs, she wrote: \\"But no one ever asked me about my politics. I was converted by association from my liberal democratic feminism to conservative Republican fundamentalism. I felt like a wolf in sheep‚Äôs clothing adapting somewhat awkwardly to becoming one of the sheep.\\" In 1985, she broke the story of the John Anthony Walker spy ring when she interviewed Walker's daughter, Laura Walker Snyder, for CBN. During the interview, Snyder detailed how her father had allegedly intimidated and manipulated his children into becoming spies.\\"DAUGHTER SAYS JOHN WALKER PRESSED CHILDREN TO BE SPIES,\\" By Susan Rasky, New York Times (June 18, 1985, Tuesday, Late City Final Edition).

The film was originally intended to be broadcast on television, but the public television network PBS and others did not pick up the soap opera. It was shown across the United States at smaller screenings throughout the 1980s until it found renewed popularity after a screening in the late 2000s at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The film was restored in 2018 by Kino Lorber and re-released at the Metrograph theater in New York City.  Cast  * Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor as Johnnie Mae Brown * Walter Cotton as Charles Brown * Sam Waymon as Raymon * Jim Wright as Father Brown  Production  Some of the characters in Personal Problems were initially developed to be featured in a radio soap opera, but this later evolved into a 30 minute video soap opera directed by Gunn and written by Ishmael. The only scene from this original 30 minute version to appear in the 1980 version was a monologue by the character played by Sam Waymon. The scenes in Personal Problems were shot using a videocassette recorder which was a new technology at the time (previously most films were shot using film stock). Gunn was known for his improvisational style of directing and was known to let actors improvise during filming, with director of photography and cameraman Robert Polidori stating: \\"Bill was interested in improvisation, which made it a little harder to shoot\\" and \\"Bill would set up scenes as an experiment. He'd set up tensions and see how the tensions turned out\\".  Reception  Glenn Kenny of the New York Times said of the film: \\"For all its rough edges, Personal Problems retains a vitality and an integrity that practically bounds off the screen.\\" He also praised the film for its intimate depiction of African American life in New York, stating, \\"it's intimate to the point of awkwardness.\\" K. Austin Collins, writing for Vanity Fair, praised the movie as a \\"textually incomplete but spiritually overflowing accomplishment\\" and described it as \\"more than a clean narrative\\" which provided windows into a woman's life; \\"windows broad and intelligent enough to encompass a wide swathe of Black life generally, but free of neat narrative conclusions.\\" Chuck Bowen of Slant Magazine gave the film four stars and applauded Gunn and Reed's intimate portrayal of the characters, stating: \\"Gunn and Reed collapse conventional notions of reality, providing simultaneous glimpses into the minds of dozens of characters, lingering on scenes and informing them with confessional intensity.\\" References ","title":"Personal Problems"},{"id":"65165457","text":"The River class is a type of bulk carrier designed for service on the Great Lakes. One ship of the class is due to enter service for the Interlake Steamship Company in 2022. History In April 2019, it was announced that Interlake had ordered a single River-class ship from Fincantieri Bay Shipbuilding of Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. The vessel was the first new ship ordered by Interlake since 1981, and the first Great Lakes bulker built on the Great Lakes since 1983. Construction began in August 2019, when the first steel was cut. The ship was built in modular sections, the first of which were joined together at a ceremonial keel laying in June 2020. At the event, Interlake announced that she would be named Mark W. Barker, with delivery scheduled for mid-2022. Design The River class was designed by Interlake, Fincantieri Bay, and Bay Engineering, and measures long, with a beam of and a draft of . It has a deadweight tonnage of 28,000 DWT, with a unique cargo hold and hatch design that allows for the transport of both bulk raw materials and large individual cargo. As a self-unloading ship, a bow-mounted conveyor system that is long is installed for offloading of bulk materials. Ship propulsion power is about from two diesel engines--EMD 710s on Mark W.

It is currently held in the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, Australia. Description A 5th-century BC Greek vase in the British Museum with illustrations of Sirens similar to those in Ulysses and the Sirens The work depicts a scene from the ancient Greek epic the Odyssey, in which the Sirens attempt to use their enchanting song to lure the titular hero Odysseus and his crew towards deadly waters. As per the Odyssey, Odysseus' crew had already blocked their ears to protect themselves from the Sirens' singing, but Odysseus, wanting to hear the Sirens, had ordered his crew to tie him to the mast so that he may have the pleasure of listening without risking himself or his ship. The most controversial aspect of Waterhouse's painting was his depiction of the Sirens, as it differed greatly from contemporary Victorian era conceptions. While many of the original audience had expected to see the Sirens as mermaid-like nymphs, they were surprised to find them as bird-like creatures with women's heads. However, at the time of initial exhibition, The Magazine of Art critic Marion H. Spielmann noted that the idea of half-bird, half-woman Sirens is supported by depictions of Sirens similar to Waterhouse's on classical Greek vases. Exhibition The painting was first exhibited in 1891 at the Royal Academy, London to critical acclaim for the imaginative and romantic representation of its subject. In the June of that year, Sir Hubert von Herkomer purchased the work for the National Gallery of Victoria, and it has been in their collection since.

The region has a number of active volcanoes, but is under pressure from growing human populations pushing into higher elevations and more marginal land. With elevations rising from sea level to , and precipitation varying between rainforest and drier forest levels, the area has many different forest types - evergreen, deciduous and semi-alpine.  Location and description  The islands of Java and Bali are the products of relatively recent volcanism - Java is less than 24 million years old, and Bali less than 3 million years. During recent ice ages when sea levels were lower the islands were connected to Sumatra and Borneo. There are 20 volcanoes on the islands that have been active during human history. The geology is volcanic rock, alluvial soils, and some areas of uplifted coral limestone. The ecoregion is surrounded by the lower elevation Eastern Java-Bali rain forests ecoregion.  Climate  The climate of the ecoregion is Tropical monsoon climate (K√∂ppen climate classification (Am)). This climate is characterized by relatively even temperatures throughout the year (all months being greater than average temperature), and a pronounced dry season. The driest month has less than 60 mm of precipitation, but more than (100-(average/25) mm. This climate is mid- way between a tropical rainforest and a tropical savannah. The dry month usually at or right after the winter solstice in the Nothern Hemisphere.  Flora and fauna  The forest types in the ecoergion are driven by four main factors: elevation, soil, aspect (shape/slope of the terrain), and precipitation. At lower elevations (below about 1,000 meters), the forest types are evergreen rainforest and moist deciduous. Typical tree species in the evergreen rainforest are (Artocarpus elasticus) (Artocarpus from the Greek 'bread' and 'fruit'), Yellow mahogany (Dysoxylum caulostachyum), Longkong (Lansium parasiticum) (a member of the mahogany family that has commercially edible nuts), and (Planchonia valida). 60% of the ecoregion is closed broadleaf evergreen forest. Typical trees of the deciduous forests are (Homalium tomentosum), Silk trees (Albizia lebbekoides), Reonja (Acacia leucophloea) (a short tree with white flowers), the Golden shower tree (Cassia fistula), and White Siris (Ailanthus integrifolia). From 1,000 meters to about 1,800 meters the montane forests feature trees of (Lithocarpus), (Quercus), (Lithocarpus), (Castanopsis), and (Lauraceae). The upper montane forest features extensive heath Ericaceae, with widespread moss. Over 100 mammal species are known in the ecoregion. The mammals include the vulnerable Javan tailless fruit bat (Megaerops kusnotoi), which is near-endemic, and the Javan leopard (Panthera pardus melas). 215 species of birds have been recorded, 15 of which are endemic.  Protected areas  Only 7% of the ecoregion is officially protected. Notable protected areas include: * Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park, in East Java, centered on the active volcano Mount Bromo. * Meru Betiri National Park, in East Java, reaching down to the seacoast where it protects the nesting grounds of endangered turtles.

After serving until mid-1917 in various iterations of a bombing squadron, they were re-equipped with Nieuport fighters. With their Nieuports, and their subsequent SPADs, they destroyed 28 enemy airplanes by the ceasefire. History Escadrille Spa.112 began its existence on 1 September 1914 as Escadrille V.29, the squadron designation reflecting its equipment with Voisin aircraft. On 18 December, they were tasked to support Ier Armee. On 15 May 1915, they were renamed Escadrille VB.112, meaning they must have been outfitted with new bomber airplanes.

Its origins are not known in detail, but is believed to have originated sometime in the early 19th century. The earliest known mention is from an 1838 diary of a Canadian traveler to the United States, Katherine Jane Ellice, but it did not gain international name recognition until Charles Dickens included the drink in The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit. To make the drink, orange and lemon are muddled with simple syrup, shaken with ice in a cocktail shaker, and strained into a highball glass filled with crushed ice. Garnishes include mint leaves, raspberry, and orange and lemon slices. It can also be garnished with pineapple wedges or any seasonal berries. Some recipes add pineapple juice. History The Sherry Cobbler emerged during the 1830s and became one of the most popular mixed drinks in the 19th century United States. The invention of the drinking straw around this time made crushed ice drinks like the Sherry Cobbler more convenient. The earliest known reference to a \\"Cobbler\\" dates the diary of Canadian traveler Katherine Jane Ellice. It was included in the first book that is known to be specifically for bartenders, that is Jerry Thomas' 1862 edition of The Bartender's Guide. This original recipe is made with just three ingredients: *2 wine glasses sherry *1 tbsp sugar *2 or 3 slices of orange The popularity of Sherry Cobbler inspired many spinoff drinks like the Champagne Cobber, Claret Cobbler, and Whiskey Cobbler. In 1888, Harry Johnson wrote \\"This drink is without doubt the most popular beverage in this country, with ladies as well as with gentlemen,\\" but like many classic cocktails their popularity fades after Prohibition. A 19th-century recipe for Fourth of July Sherry cobbler is made with strawberries, lemon peel, powdered sugar and sherry. Variations Classic cobblers didn't include muddled fruits but the popularity of the Sherry Cobbler inspired the creation of more elaborate cobblers. The King's Cobbler was made with rhubarb amaro called Zucca rabarbaro instead of fortified wine. Other ingredients were muddled strawberry, fresh lemon juice and simple syrup, with a mint leaf garnish.

He is known for his throwing skills, even when measured among Mongolian sumo wrestlers, who tend to use throws more than average reflecting the skills used in B√∂kh. He is the nephew of former yokozuna Asash≈çry≈´. Early life and sumo background Born as the second son of former Yokozuna Asash≈çry≈´'s brother, Sugarragchaa started wrestling at 11 years old. Upon graduation from middle school, he was scouted from Mongolia, and moved to Japan to attend Nippon Sport Science University Kashiwa High School. In his first year, as part of a school trip, he visited the Kokugikan in Ry≈çgoku and became interested in sumo. After consulting with his uncle he committed to trying sumo at the high school level. Though he had no previous experience, he quickly started getting good results in amateur sumo tournaments and was seen as having great potential. After high school he joined Tatsunami stable. During this time he emailed regularly with his uncle who gave him such advice as \\"build on your own strengths\\" and \\"don't put on weight quickly or you'll risk injury.\\" Career H≈çsh≈çry≈´ first stepped into the ring professionally in March 2018. He joined at the same time as Naya, who was also garnering attention as the grandson of the greatly respected yokozuna Taih≈ç. In H≈çsh≈çry≈´'s second tournament, he took the jonidan championship with a perfect 7-0 and was already regularly using throws and leg sweeps to win against his opponents. He only had one losing tournament, or makekoshi, in his rise through the lower ranks. This was a 3-4 performance at makushita 2 when he was on the cusp of promotion to the salaried ranks of j≈´ry≈ç in July 2019. He quickly bounced back the following tournament in September and with a 4-3 winning tournament, or kachikoshi, he earned j≈´ry≈ç promotion for the November tournament in Fukuoka. His j≈´ry≈ç debut was a makekoshi, decided on the last day in a loss to fellow Mongolian Sakigake by overarm throw. Despite this setback he logged two 8-7 records in the next two consecutive tournaments. In the subsequent July 2020 tournament (held in Tokyo instead of the usual Nagoya due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic) he took part in a rare six man playoff, where he defeated Kyokutaisei. This culminated in a three man playoff between three members of the same Tatsunami stable. This playoff comprised himself, Akua, and Meisei. Bouts between stablemates are only allowed in the case of playoffs where two or more wrestlers end up with the same record, and is a rare occurrence. He was defeated by Meisei who went on to defeat Akua and take the championship. However, his performance was still enough to propel him into the top-tier makuuchi division for the September 2020 tournament. He is the 50th foreigner to reach the top division, and the 27th Mongolian.

Background After the Swedish main army under Carl Johan Adlercreutz had won at the Battle of Alavus the newly appointed Russian commander, Nikolay Mikhailovich Kamensky, shifted his focus from the Swedish left‚Äîthe Swedish force near Karstula under Otto von Fieandt‚Äîtowards their center at Alavus, while only smaller contingents were ordered to engage the Swedish flanks; von Fieandt was defeated at the Battle of Karstula by Jegor Vlastov, which brought an end to the Swedish hopes of holding the two-way intersection at Lintulaks; another Russian force under Colonel Koslov meanwhile marched to engage Carl von Otter on the Swedish right flank, at Nummij√§rvi (hardly two Scandinavian miles southeast of the Kauhajoki church). Swedish forces Apart from a 100 man strong Landwehr and a contingent of dragoons, von Otter's force consisted of: *√ñsterbotten Infantry Regiment (1 Battalion ‚Äì five companies) *Bj√∂rneborg Infantry Regiment (1 Battalion) *Finnish Artillery Regiment (4 guns) In total: 1,250 men and 4 guns Battle Koslov brought 1,500 men and 2 guns with him to beat von Otter's forces of 1,250 men with 4 guns and to capture the road junction by the church. The Swedes received him in a formation that crossed over the highway with its right flank protected by the Nummij√§rvi lake and the front by a small stream. At 5:00 p.m. Koslov attacked along their whole line, but as he had left a significant amount of troops in reserve the attack didn't achieve enough weight to break through the Swedish lines, for which reason it stalled; von Otter then seized the initiative and counterattacked with his whole force and by 9:00 p.m. the Russians were forced to retreat. Their loss had reached 200 privates and six officers dead and wounded while 46 privates and two officers had been captured while von Otter had sustained 90 privates and four officers dead and wounded; he was, however, reinforced by about 3,000 men under Eberhard von Vegesack shortly after‚Äîjust in time before the following battle the next day, at Lappfj√§rd. Aftermath The Swedes abandoned their position at Nummij√§rvi after the battle at Lappfj√§rd, as the 2nd Swedish division received orders from the Swedish headquarters to join up with the Swedish main army at Kuortane, in advance of the Battles of Salmi and Ruona; however, due to a series of conflicting orders and misunderstanding the 2nd division didn't reach the Swedish main army in time before the battle‚Äîwhile the road junction at Kauhajoki was easily captured by Usjakov as the 150 defenders were forced to retreat with a loss of 25 men.

On the second floor of Krider's shop was a taxidermy shop, where hundreds of bird specimens were prepared over multiple decades. In 1859, Krider manufactured the first 25 prototypes of the LeMat Revolver, also known as the \\"Grape Shot Revolver\\". The unique firearm had been developed in New Orleans in 1856 by Jean Alexandre Le Mat, whose manufacturing effort was backed by P. G. T. Beauregard, who became a general in the Confederate States Army. He is the namesake of Krider's hawk (Buteo jamaicensis kriderii).  Biography = Early life  Krider was born in West Philadelphia in 1813, and became the apprentice of Prosper Vallee the gunsmith in 1826. Vallee had opened a shop about ten years earlier, in a stone house built in 1751 by Edward Drinker, on the northeast corner of Second and Walnut streets, Philadelphia. By 1839, Krider had bought Vallee's gunsmith business and founded a sporting goods store at that location.  Specimen collections  Krider was an avid collector and contributed hundreds of study skins, nests, and eggs to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (ANSP) during his lifetime. More than a century later, these specimens are widely distributed in museum collections including the National Museum of Natural History (Smithsonian Institution), Museum of Comparative Zoology (Harvard University), and American Museum of Natural History. Krider collected many rare specimens in the Philadelphia area including yellow-headed blackbird and smooth-billed ani, which are now preserved in the ANSP collection. Krider published little, but his contributions were frequently acknowledged by other ornithologists. For example, in 1856, the curator of birds at ANSP, John Cassin, wrote: \\"Our friend Mr. John Krider, Gunsmith, whose establishment is a favorite place of resort of the Ornithologists and gunners of this city, and who is well acquainted with American birds, and very successful in obtaining specimens of rare species, has had several specimens of this Brant brought to him in the last two or three years.\\"  Krider's hawk  Historic photograph (c. 1880) of Krider's Gun Shop on the northeast corner of Second and Walnut streets. The building was razed in 1955. Bernard A. Hoopes described Krider's hawk (Buteo jamaicensis kriderii), a disputed subspecies of red-tailed hawk, in 1873: \\"Being convinced that it is undescribed, I have named it in honor of the veteran naturalist to whom we are indebted for the discovery.\\" The type specimen is preserved in the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University.

The earliest known recipes date to the 1850s. It may be an antecedent of Boston cream pie. The earlier Washington pie was a sandwich cake of two yellow sponge layers filled with jam and dusted with powdered sugar, later evolving into the better known chocolate-covered pastry cream filled version.What Constitutes Mysterious Washington Pie? The Washington Post, Washington, District of Columbia, 12 Apr 1908 Raspberry jam was a common choice, though any type of jelly could be used. Additional flavorings like kirsch or rosewater could be added. Some modern variations use a vanilla cream filling topped with cherry pie filling and whipped cream. The sugar can be sprinkled using a lace doily to create a decorative pattern. Slices of Washington pie were sold at stalls at the Northern Liberty Market on Mount Vernon Square until the market was demolished on the orders of Alexander Robey Shepherd in 1872. Another version, closer to a true pie, was made by soaking pieces of stale and leftover cake with cream, and adding raisins and spices and baking it in pastry crust, always in square pans.History of Washington Pie, The Morning Journal-Courier, New Haven, Connecticut, 19 Nov 1898 It's been described as a \\"nefarious fraud\\", but was served at elegant hotels and boarding houses in the Northeastern United States, more commonly than other pies, and it was also sold in quantity by bakers. This version eventually developed a poor reputation during the American Civil War when it started to be sold at coffee stands and other establishments around docks and railroad depots, because \\"certain bakers, in their efforts to produce great quantities of it, were not so very careful as to what it was composed of. Some bakers got to making it out of stale bread and the like\\". Washington pie was served at a Fourth of July celebration in Decatur, Nebraska in 1856. Washington pie was recommended as part of a menu for a Fourth of July party for young ladies in 1901, along with other desserts.Good Housekeeping, July 1901 According to a 1934 article published in the Detroit Free Press, the cake layers could be made with cottage pudding instead of traditional sponge cake.Cottage Pudding Proves Equally at Home in an Apartment or Fine Mansion, Detroit Free Press, Detroit, Michigan. 13 Feb 1934, Page 10, See also * List of cakes References Category:American cakes Category:Sponge cakes Category:Layer cakes Category:Fourth of July foods Category:Historical foods in American cuisine ","title":"Washington pie"},{"id":"65166146","title":"Collector's Series (The Judds album)"},{"id":"65166173","text":"Fernando de Trazegnies Granda, 5th Marquis de Torrebermeja and 7th Count of Las Lagunas (Lima, 3 September 1935) is a Peruvian legal scholar, diplomat, historian, writer and professor.

Shakemap showing intensity of the M8.0 event.  Tectonic setting  Both the mainshock and aftershock occurred along the Sagaing Fault; a continental transform fault boundary that links the Andaman Spreading Center to the south and the Main Himalayan Thrust to the north. It defines the boundary between the Burma Plate and Sunda Plate. The Sagaing Fault is the most active geological structure in the country and poses significant risks to major cities such as Yangon, Mandalay and Naypyidaw.

Monster and Washer Woman are an eroded fin composed of Wingate Sandstone, which is the remains of wind-borne sand dunes deposited approximately 200 million years ago in the Late Triassic. The nearest higher neighbor is Aztec Butte, to the west-northwest, Airport Tower is set to the east, and Mesa Arch is situated to the west. A short hike to Mesa Arch provides the easiest view of Monster Tower. Access to the tower is via the four-wheel drive White Rim Road, which is the other way to see Monster. The top of this geological formation rises 1,400 feet above the road in approximately one mile. Precipitation runoff from Monster Tower drains southeast into the nearby Colorado River via Buck Canyon.
